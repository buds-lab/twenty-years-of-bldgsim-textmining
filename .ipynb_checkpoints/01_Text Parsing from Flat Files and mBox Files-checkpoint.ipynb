I realize there is no panacea answer but I would be curious to know what the effect of modeling a single window with enlarged frame area vs actual window size and frame width is.  Is it a 5% difference or a 20% or .05%.  I am curious only because I have always assumed the difference was small and that there were more important (larger impact) modeling items to worry about.  \\n  \\n Please note that I am not trying to discount the importance of correctly modeling windows but trying to understand the overall impact different modeling techniques might have on output.    \\n  \\n Mike Tillou\\n etc Group, Inc. \\n ________________________________\\n \\n From: postman at gard.com on behalf of Fred Porter\\n Sent: Mon 4/12/2004 10:48 AM\\n To: BLDG-SIM at gard.com\\n Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Curtain wall frames and fenestration area\\n \\n \\n Also, if you are using either of the detailed glazing models, the way Steve describes should better account for edge-of-glass effects. Dividing glazing up into lots of tiny little \"panes,\" as some architects want, has an extemely delterious effect on the IGU overall U-factor, above and beyond the effect of the frame itself. If using the SC inputs, it might be instructive to run Window 5 on some similar configurations, to check the overall U-value with DOE2\\'s output.

For those windows, a better approach is to define one of the windows, together with its fins/overhang, and then use the window MULTIPLIER to establish the total number of windows on the wall wall.  If the overhang shades a significant portion of the wall, in addition to the window, then the overhang can be defined as a separate shading surface.\\n \\n \\t\\t----- Original Message ----- \\n \\t\\tFrom:Mike Tillou <mailto:miket at etcgrp.com>  \\n \\t\\tTo:BLDG-SIM at gard.com \\n \\t\\tSent: Monday, April 12, 2004 7:44 AM\\n \\t\\tSubject: [BLDG-SIM] Curtain wall frames and fenestration area\\n \\n \\t\\tRenee,\\n \\t\\t \\n \\t\\tThe easiest way to do this is to use a single window on each wall.  Calculate the percentage of window area that is actually frame and then adjust the frame-width to account for the increase.  You may end up with a window frame width that is 12 inches or bigger  (if the wall is large enough).  With a little ingenuity you can write some BDL code that will automatically calculate the window width, frame width and x position of the window on the wall so you don\\'t get any cautions or warnings.  .  \\n \\t\\t \\n \\t\\t \\n \\t\\t \\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\tMichael Tillou, PE\\n \\t\\tetc Group, Inc.\\n \\t\\tPO Box 749,  North Adams, MA 01247\\n \\t\\tPh.

This curtain wall, like many curtain walls, has metal frames around many small panes of glass that make up the total curtain wall. My question is, how do you treat the frames and the fenestration area?  If I model each small pane of glass and add the exact frame, this would probably overwhelm DOE2 due to the huge number of small windows.  If I model the glass as one big window, then is it correct to just add the total width of the frame to each of these large windows? Also, some of these curtain wall panes have fins to complicate things, so if I do one big glass pane, then adding the fins would make huge fins on either side of the glass. If you have dealt with modeling curtain walls, as probably many of you have, please let me know how you have dealt with these issues.\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\tThank you,\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\tRenee\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\tRenee Azerbegi\\n \\t\\tRMH Group\\n \\t\\t303-239-0909x641\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\tThis email was scanned by SC E-mail Anti-Virus Agent at 7:44:05 AM 4/12/2004 the RMH Group, Inc.\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t---->\\n \\t\\tThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and intended solely for the use\\n \\t\\tof the individual or entity to whom they are addressed.
