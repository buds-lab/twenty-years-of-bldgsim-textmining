The warehouse section of our facility in El Salvador is to be ventilated only.  The textile section of the same building will be cooled and humidity will be controlled. Other areas such as offices and cafeteria will be cooled. There is no heating load in El Salvador. I reviewed inquiry 5088 (copy below) which would suggest the warehouse should be modeled with air conditioning in both the base case and the proposed case even though no cooling will be provided.  Our building is a little different than the building in inquiry 5088 in that it has no heating load.  Therefore by the 90.1 standard, the standard does not apply (section 2.2) and it is an unconditioned space.  We feel the ventilated section of our building should be rated based on energy savings of standard ventilation equipment versus the proposed high efficiency fans and louvers that we are providing for ventilation.  We would like to proceed with the ventilated enclosures being included in the model without heating or cooling.  Please advise.

It is not acceptable to allow spaces to exceed the unmet load hour requirements of the ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G methodology. This is a similar situation to naturally ventilated spaces, which are required to include cooling systems to meet space loads in the proposed case even if the actual building will contain no cooling. Building owners may always choose to turn off HVAC systems, or not have them installed at all to conserve energy, but the ASHRAE modeling protocol assumes that cooling systems will be installed and run with sufficient capacity to meet space loads. The applicant may use a set-point of 80 degrees Fahrenheit for the maintenance bays, but cooling system capacity must be increased until the requirements of ASHRAE 90.1-2004 section G3.1.2.2 are met. The project may still receive credit for using an efficient cooling system as compared to the ASHRAE baseline cooling system.

 

    Inquiry [] 

       
     Our project is located in Las Vegas and consists of a combination of office spaces and maintenance bays for earth-moving equipment. The owner is a large agency that sells, rents and repairs such equipment; these repairs are done both inside and outside the building envelope. The maintenance bays are occupied by mechanics and will be conditioned with evaporative coolers and gas furnace heat, the system supplies 100% outside air. This cooling system provides conditioning of the spaces but is not able to meet all peak loads for a climate such as Las Vegas even when these spaces are modeled with higher setpoint at 80 degrees. In reality, if the maintenance bays go above the temperature setpoints, the mechanics will continue work in the warmer conditions or take a break. This is not difficult for maintenance bays, where some of the work will also done outdoors with no conditioning at all. The owner does not want to fully condition the maintenance bays with the intention of achieving high levels of energy efficiency. We propose the following modeling approach for EA Credit 1. -Baseline model will have a mechanical system based on Table G3.1.1A of Appendix G with 80 degree temperature setpoint for the maintenance bays. -Proposed Design model will have the system as designed in the building that provides partial conditioning with the same 80 degree temperature setpoint. We will not model additional compressor cooling for hours where the system is not able to meet loads. This approach will result in exceeding the difference in the unmet load hours beyond 50 as required by Appendix G. However, this is a conscious decision by the owner who wants to maximize energy efficiency by providing limited conditioning through evaporative cooling for the maintenance bays, and allow the temperatures to float higher during peak conditions. We feel that this approach appropriately captures the intent of the design, and gives credit to the energy efficiency measures being taken. It also provides a way for demonstrating the value of an energy efficient approach to the community in Las Vegas where compressor cooling is increasingly used, often indiscriminately; this is a desert climate and a different approach to comfort and conditioning is possible. Is this approach acceptable? If not, can you advise us on an alternative approach that addresses the desire of the owner to demonstrate high levels of energy efficiency for using such a system?

Message-ID: <005f01cc2062$98f9e6e0$caedb4a0$@net>

Greetings everyone,

I am relatively new to this list, and have been using eQUEST for only about
a year. I am modeling a 3-story office building with water-loop heat pumps,
but information from the building owner, architect, and engineer are very
limited.

 

The WSHPs are single-zone (as far as I know) and there are tons of them. In
eQUEST, do I have to create a separate zone for each one? If I make larger
zones (eg. grouping together perimeter offices), it creates heat pumps that
are too large. Is there any way to simplify the zoning and retain the proper
heat pump size and number?

Hi All,

 

For LEED 2009, in relation to EA P2 (Minimum Energy Performance) and EA
C1 (Optimise Energy Performance) can anyone confirm whether the local
code must be applied to the baseline building, if local code is more
stringent than ASHRAE 90.1-2007?

 

For other credits, LEED is clear that compliance must be shown by
applying the more stringent code but for EA P2 and EA C1, it ambiguously
states that "If the project is using a computer simulation, adhere to
Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1-2007 or equivalent local code". 

 

Any advice appreciated if you have worked on any projects where local
code is more stringent than ASHRAE 90.1.

 

Thanks in advance,

Being from California, I can tell you that we utilize ASHRAE 90.1 for
compliance since it is less stringent than the local state code.  For EAp2
and EAc1 you do have the option of utilizing either or.  LEED does state
that IF you do utilize anything other than ASHRAE it has to be more
stringent.

Hi Christian,

 

A LEED reviewer brought up this issue for a heated/ventilated-only
garage space recently.  Owner did not want a cooling system beyond
ventilation, and one was not designed.  Ultimately, our reviewer cited
TG3.1.1.b / G3.1.10 directly, and I conceded to model baseline-esque
cooling systems in both models.  

 

I'm not sure section 2.2 is a great defense as it states the standard
doesn't apply to *envelopes* without a heating/cooling system... not
ventilation systems (2.2.b.).  A better defense is if your warehouse is
by 90.1 glossary terms an unconditioned space, by virtue of not meeting
any of the three conditioned space definitions.  In that case, I think
you could flatly reject TG3.1.1.b as "not applicable" if it were brought
up.  In our garage space above, this wasn't an option as it was
definitely a heated space (see glossary for underlined terms).

 

I'd agree modeling both models with ventilation only is the intuitive
thing to do in the context of a validation (LEED) model.  The intent of
this language however, if I'm not mistaken, is to discourage/punish
design decisions to omit heating and/or cooling systems entirely to save
energy.  Never mind that's actually a very effective strategy, under the
right circumstances and in moderation...  I've got some contrarian
opinions in this department, so I'll keep my mouth shut =).

This is not difficult for maintenance bays, where some of the work will

efficient approach to the community in Las Vegas where compressor
cooling is increasingly used, often indiscriminately; this is a desert
climate and a different approach to comfort and conditioning is
possible. Is this approach acceptable? If not, can you advise us on an
alternative approach that addresses the desire of the owner to
demonstrate high levels of energy efficiency for using such a system?

Hi Ben,

 

If you want the quantity/capacities of your modeled systems to match the
scheduled equipment, you should match the actual zoning.  

 

Combining zones pretty much requires combining systems, as far as I
know... this is a by-product of the "1 system per zone" rule for DOE2.  

 

"Too large" is relative - you could explain the system is an
approximation/sum of multiple heat pumps working together... but if you
are documenting the model extensively (i.e. LEED), you may find it less
work in the long haul to invest some extra time setting up the zoning
geometries accurately to start.  That's my standard practice for heavily
documented projects.

Christian,

 

For good or bad, I have ended up modeling many Warehouse Distribution
Centers, which in essence have a very small front office and a very large
warehouse that is only ventilated (by code).  I have had to argue with LEED
reviewers this point, fortunately successfully.  The warehouse area is by
definition "unconditioned space", just like Nick states.  Though you still
have to model an HVAC system per ASHRAE, but spreading the setpoints
basically to outside air design conditions.  The reviews I have had have
made it through this way.  By doing this with the setpoints, you will not
have any unmet hours.  But you are still providing the right amount of
ventilation air per 62.1 and the right power for all the fans.  The office
is a totally different story, which you pretty much know the answer to.

 

I have had the comments go both way on the following.  Since the Warehouse
is not conditioned I had one reviewer tell me to change the Baseline HVAC
system to packaged units due to the fact that the only conditioned space was
a tiny 10,000 sq.ft. space.  Other reveiwers have left me keep my standard
ASHRAE System 8 baseline with the modifications mentioned above for the
warehouse area. (I usually utilize two air handlers: one for warehouse and

Hi Christian,

 

A LEED reviewer brought up this issue for a heated/ventilated-only garage
space recently.  Owner did not want a cooling system beyond ventilation, and
one was not designed.  Ultimately, our reviewer cited TG3.1.1.b / G3.1.10
directly, and I conceded to model baseline-esque cooling systems in both
models.  

 

I'm not sure section 2.2 is a great defense as it states the standard
doesn't apply to *envelopes* without a heating/cooling system. not
ventilation systems (2.2.b.).  A better defense is if your warehouse is by
90.1 glossary terms an unconditioned space, by virtue of not meeting any of
the three conditioned space definitions.  In that case, I think you could
flatly reject TG3.1.1.b as "not applicable" if it were brought up.  In our
garage space above, this wasn't an option as it was definitely a heated
space (see glossary for underlined terms).

 

I'd agree modeling both models with ventilation only is the intuitive thing
to do in the context of a validation (LEED) model.  The intent of this
language however, if I'm not mistaken, is to discourage/punish design
decisions to omit heating and/or cooling systems entirely to save energy.
Never mind that's actually a very effective strategy, under the right
circumstances and in moderation.  I've got some contrarian opinions in this
department, so I'll keep my mouth shut =).

The warehouse section of our facility in El Salvador is to be ventilated
only.  The textile section of the same building will be cooled and humidity
will be controlled. Other areas such as offices and cafeteria will be
cooled. There is no heating load in El Salvador. I reviewed inquiry 5088
(copy below) which would suggest the warehouse should be modeled with air
conditioning in both the base case and the proposed case even though no
cooling will be provided.  Our building is a little different than the
building in inquiry 5088 in that it has no heating load.  Therefore by the
90.1 standard, the standard does not apply (section 2.2) and it is an
unconditioned space.  We feel the ventilated section of our building should
be rated based on energy savings of standard ventilation equipment versus
the proposed high efficiency fans and louvers that we are providing for
ventilation.  We would like to proceed with the ventilated enclosures being
included in the model without heating or cooling.  Please advise.

It is not acceptable to allow spaces to exceed the unmet load hour
requirements of the ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G methodology. This is a
similar situation to naturally ventilated spaces, which are required to
include cooling systems to meet space loads in the proposed case even if the
actual building will contain no cooling. Building owners may always choose
to turn off HVAC systems, or not have them installed at all to conserve
energy, but the ASHRAE modeling protocol assumes that cooling systems will
be installed and run with sufficient capacity to meet space loads. The
applicant may use a set-point of 80 degrees Fahrenheit for the maintenance
bays, but cooling system capacity must be increased until the requirements
of ASHRAE 90.1-2004 section G3.1.2.2 are met. The project may still receive
credit for using an efficient cooling system as compared to the ASHRAE
baseline cooling system.

 

    Inquiry [  <https://www.usgbc.org/images/LI/Minus.GIF> ] 


 

Our project is located in Las Vegas and consists of a combination of office
spaces and maintenance bays for earth-moving equipment. The owner is a large
agency that sells, rents and repairs such equipment; these repairs are done
both inside and outside the building envelope. The maintenance bays are
occupied by mechanics and will be conditioned with evaporative coolers and
gas furnace heat, the system supplies 100% outside air. This cooling system
provides conditioning of the spaces but is not able to meet all peak loads
for a climate such as Las Vegas even when these spaces are modeled with
higher setpoint at 80 degrees. In reality, if the maintenance bays go above
the temperature setpoints, the mechanics will continue work in the warmer
conditions or take a break. This is not difficult for maintenance bays,
where some of the work will also done outdoors with no conditioning at all.
The owner does not want to fully condition the maintenance bays with the
intention of achieving high levels of energy efficiency. We propose the
following modeling approach for EA Credit 1. -Baseline model will have a
mechanical system based on Table G3.1.1A of Appendix G with 80 degree
temperature setpoint for the maintenance bays. -Proposed Design model will
have the system as designed in the building that provides partial
conditioning with the same 80 degree temperature setpoint. We will not model
additional compressor cooling for hours where the system is not able to meet
loads. This approach will result in exceeding the difference in the unmet
load hours beyond 50 as required by Appendix G. However, this is a conscious
decision by the owner who wants to maximize energy efficiency by providing
limited conditioning through evaporative cooling for the maintenance bays,
and allow the temperatures to float higher during peak conditions. We feel
that this approach appropriately captures the intent of the design, and
gives credit to the energy efficiency measures being taken. It also provides
a way for demonstrating the value of an energy efficient approach to the
community in Las Vegas where compressor cooling is increasingly used, often
indiscriminately; this is a desert climate and a different approach to
comfort and conditioning is possible. Is this approach acceptable? If not,
can you advise us on an alternative approach that addresses the desire of
the owner to demonstrate high levels of energy efficiency for using such a
system?

Please note that 90.1-2010 has new baseline HVAC system 
types for heated only storage which are heating and 
ventilation units. It also contains an allowance for fan 
power related to non-mechanical cooling fans.

Hi Ben,

I agree with Nick. Also, if you have to bill match at all, which you might
since this is an existing building, it is always easier to model the
building as close to the design as you can.

Best,

Carol

Bill:

We have confronted the same difficult situation on industrial projects with greater than 50% costs due to process loads. We have found ourselves in more detailed discussions with process designers and process equipment vendors, working out the impact of different energy system decisions.

One possible way to think about your unique process is to break it down into smaller, more manageable pieces, and describe how the small pieces use energy efficiency technology.

If there are motor loads, is there an opportunity for premium efficiency motors and variable speed drives?
If there is combustion, are there a variety of burner / heat exchanger designs with a range of efficiencies? Is it possibile to economize stack losses?
If there is refrigeration, are there opportunities for recovering waste heat to serve other needs?

It's something of a gamble to know if the efficiency choices you are making really are better than what any other sensible designer who wasn't considering the energy impact would do. In the end it can come down to the judgment of the modeler and the LEED Reviewer, which may not be the most comfortable place but seems to be where we live on these types of projects.

Hi William,

The "large process load" issue has been discussed extensively. Basically, the process loads are not allowed to be omitted from baseline and proposed design models. For your case, without touching the process loads, you probably have little chance to claim energy credit even you are allowed to modify the baseline. The possible solution will be the Process loads itself. See whether you are able to claim savings due to the introducition of high efficient equipments. Bear in mind, reduction of energy use in process loads is allowed as long as it is well documented with a comparison between market standard equipments (baseline) and energy-efficient ones (proposed design). By searching this forum or online, you will be able to find more info on this subject.

Hi William,
We did a Leed warehouse herre in Canada but it was version NC 1.0, your 2.2 version.
In that case process energy has to be remove for comparaison with baseline.
We aslo can reclaim up to 2 credit in process energy i.e. heat recovery from refrigeration.
If it is Leed 2009 than you have to include process energy in baseline and proposed.

Hey all,

I'm about to begin a LEED energy model for a warehouse project that contains a very large process load. It will be a major renovation project. The building will be broken out as 50,000 sq ft office and 300,000 sq ft warehouse. The anticipated HVAC systems on the project are package rooftop units with DX cooling/gas heating for both the office and warehouse areas. The warehouse space requires cooling and heating.

Two issues that come to light:

1.       Large Process Load
a.       Anticipated process load will consume roughly 40-60% of the buildings annual energy consumption. The Exceptional calculation method has been considered. However, the process being done at this facility is extraordinary and there is not a "baseline" to compare savings off of.
2.       Baseline System
a.       Based on the size of the warehouse, System 7 will be modeled. This system is a packaged rooftop VAV with reheat with chilled water and hot water boiler system. Based on previous experience and preliminary modeling results, the baseline system will be more energy efficient than the package rooftop units with DX cooling/gas heating. There's been a suggestion by our team to request a LEED Interpretation and to possible change the baseline system to also packaged rooftop units with DX cooling/gas heating as that is typically designed for warehouse type facilities.

Based on these two issues, I am having a hard time foreseeing this project being able to hit the minimum 5% savings requirement on major renovations. I searched the LEED Interpretations database but didn't find one that dealt with a project that had both these issues.

Any suggestions?

Well at the risk of referring you to the published work, the user?s manual describes the methodology quite thoroughly as well as what all of the fields are. I would think it would be a good starting point to developing your ?own TMY2? datasets:

If you are looking for someone to summarize that work, I am sure there are consultants on this list that could undertake that effort at an hourly rate.

Aaron,

 

Thanks for the much appreciated feedback. This seems to be the same conclusion we are coming to also. It seems that data center, manufacturing, process driving projects will have little chance to meet the require of EAp2 unless you use an exceptional calculation method. However, even if you go down that route, there is still a risk of whether the savings you will try to claim will be enough to meet the minimum.

Bill:

 

We have confronted the same difficult situation on industrial projects with greater than 50% costs due to process loads. We have found ourselves in more detailed discussions with process designers and process equipment vendors, working out the impact of different energy system decisions. 

 

One possible way to think about your unique process is to break it down into smaller, more manageable pieces, and describe how the small pieces use energy efficiency technology.

 

If there are motor loads, is there an opportunity for premium efficiency motors and variable speed drives?

If there is combustion, are there a variety of burner / heat exchanger designs with a range of efficiencies? Is it possibile to economize stack losses?

If there is refrigeration, are there opportunities for recovering waste heat to serve other needs?

Etc. etc., based on the specific pieces of the process.

 

It's something of a gamble to know if the efficiency choices you are making really are better than what any other sensible designer who wasn't considering the energy impact would do. In the end it can come down to the judgment of the modeler and the LEED Reviewer, which may not be the most comfortable place but seems to be where we live on these types of projects.

Hi all

I have a question in relation to Core Performance Guide for advanced
buildings. 
I am looking at 2009 Core & shell office building and I want to go down
the Advanced Buildings Core Performance Guide Route.

Section 2.6 Fenestration Performance states that for buildings with
window and glazed door area greater than 40% of the gross area of
above-grade walls.............energy modelling must be conducted to
demonstrate equivalent performance.

What is meant by this statement, does this mean that you have to go back
to the performance rating method according ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G?  Or
does it mean a more simple model where you check that heat loss, solar
gain and light transmission is equal or less with a building which has
say 60% glazed area compared to the Criteria set out for glazing in
table 2.6.1 for 40% glazed area?

Any thoughts on this would be appreciated

Thanks

After almost seven weeks wait, we finally received a response from USGBC. I 
post it below for the benefit of all:

Thank you for your technical customer service inquiry regarding LEED-NCv2.2. 
Thank you for your technical customer service inquiry regarding LEED-NCv2.2. 
Yes, as unconditioned space, these enclosures may be modeled without heating 
or cooling.  The inquiry further explains that energy savings are being 
taken for these ventilated only areas based on the proposed high efficiency 
fans and louvers provided. Note that in the unconditioned space, the 
ventilation fans should be modeled identically in the Baseline and the 
Proposed case, as process energy use.  In the Baseline case, the fans may be 
modeled with the minimum motor efficiency as required by ASHRAE 90.1-2004, 
Table 10.8, and they should be modeled in the Proposed case with the motor 
efficiency as designed.  Also, note that the fan schedules should be modeled 
identically in the Baseline and Proposed case.   If the fans as designed are 
controlled by air temperature; the Baseline fans should be modeled to 
operate in the same manner.

If any further savings are anticipated by additional energy efficiency 
measures for the ventilation fans, these should be modeled using the 
Exceptional Calculation Methodology. A narrative should describe all 
Baseline and Proposed case assumptions included for this measure, and the 
calculation methodology used to determine the projected savings. The 
narrative and energy savings should be reported separately from the other 
efficiency measures in the template, Section 1.7. The Baseline case 
description should verify that the efficiency measure is not standard 
practice for a similar newly constructed facility by referencing a recently 
published document, utility incentive program that incentivises the 
equipment installed, or by documenting systems used to perform the same 
function in other newly constructed facilities. Savings associated with the 
Proposed case measure should also be justified with published or monitored 
data.

Please note that 90.1-2010 has new baseline HVAC system
types for heated only storage which are heating and
ventilation units. It also contains an allowance for fan
power related to non-mechanical cooling fans.

I haven't used the Core Performance Guide before, but that provision is
in line with ASHRAE 90.1.  From my understanding, the Core Performance
Guide is supposed to be a prescriptive path to a building that is more
energy efficient than ASHRAE 90.1 while the prescriptive route in ASHRAE
90.1 will provide minimum code compliance.  Since the prescriptive route
in ASHRAE 90.1 does not allow more than 40% glazed area, you have to
then switch to the performance route in ASHRAE 90.1, or Chapter 11.
LEED does not use Chapter 11, so my assumption would be that a building
with more than 40% glazing would be directed to Appendix G instead,
making complying with the Core Performance Guide for EAp2/EAc1 not
viable for a building with >40% glazing.

I'm curious if anyone else has a different opinion, since I have not
actually tried to apply the Core Performance Guide.

The link below is reference material from the Advanced Buildings website
for the Core Performance Guide.

http://www.advancedbuildings.net/files/advancebuildings/ABCore_Training_
slides_0.pdf

It would appear from the presentation that buildings with glazed areas
in excess of 40% require energy modelling to ASHRAE 90.1 - 2004 and
achieve a 20% improvement, to comply with Core Performance Guide.

If you are being required to do energy modelling (with all the potential
freedom for design approach) anyway it would seem pointless to bother
achieving compliance with all the core performance criteria

Help, I Can't Post
------------------

90% of the time if you cannot post it is because you are
sending from a different email address than the one you
originally subscribed from. Please see "Changing Options"
below to fix this. You can even change your email address
for all of the mailing lists at once.

Changing Options
----------------

Go to the main web page

   http://onebuilding.org/

Click on the link on the left for the mailing list you want
to change your options on. At the bottom of the page for the
specific mailing list, in the field near the button
"unsubscribe or edit options" enter your email address and
press that button. The next page will ask for a password, if
you don't remember yours click on the remind button and one
will be emailed to you. From  this page you can change to
digest mode or your email address or other options.

Archives
--------

Each of the building energy simulation mailing lists have
archives of the messages posted. There is a good chance you
can find the answer you are looking for by searching the
archives. Go to

   http://onebuilding.org/

In each paragraph about the mailing list is a link to the
archives. You can search that list from that page. In
addition, you can use Google to search the entire site
across all mailing lists by going to:

   http://onebuilding.org/search.html

Digest Mode
-----------

If you would rather receive a single email each day with all
of the messages within it, you can use Digest Mode. See the
"Changing Options" section above to turn on Digest Mode.

Links to Related Sites
----------------------

If you are interested in other simulation program mailing
lists or other sites related to building energy simulation,
see the list of links at:

http://onebuilding.org/links.html

If you have suggestions for additional links, please send me
an email.

Subject Lines
-------------

For BLDG-SIM, if the question is about a specific simulation
program, please include the name of the simulation program
in the subject line. Also please post a question about a
specific simulation program to the appropriate mailing list
first to see if you can get an answer and post to BLDG-SIM
the next day if you have not. If you are replying to a
message in a digest, please see the section below.

Replying to a Digest
--------------------

If you receive a digest, when replying to a message in the
digest, please copy the original subject line and don't
include the entire digest when replying. Just include the
original message.

I Still Need Help
-----------------

Please email me with your question, I'll try to help:

It's useful to distinguish between TMY2  as a data set and as a data format. The selection procedure is basically the same between TMY, TMY2, and TMY3, with some changes in the weighting of parameters. This procedure has become adopted by virtually all other (US at least) efforts, including ASHRAE, CEC, etc.   

The format, however, has evolved, w/ TMY3 choosing a CSV format that's easier to import to a spreadsheet program. I don't see any benefit to staying w/ the TMY2 fixed field format.

Dear Joe and All;

Many thanks for your valuable replies, i'll have a deep look and get back to you if you allow me. However, for the time being it is beneficial for me to know the procedure in terms of flow chart if any one of you can provide me one !!
 
With regard to the CSV extension of the new TMY3, i agree it is very useful and easy but to bypass using the TMY3-TMY2 convertor, the recent data sets can be compiled for the time being into TMY2 for usage by building simulation tools.

Kind regards,

Well at the risk of referring you to the published work, the user?s manual describes the methodology quite thoroughly as well as what all of the fields are. I would think it would be a good starting point to developing your ?own TMY2? datasets:

Message-ID: <DDC6CEED88CBED46868D11CF3A96EC8225D41953@VA3DIAXVS1C1.RED001.local>

I'm modelling a grocery store in EE4 and I'm not really sure what to do with the fairly large walk-in cooler section.   I gather there are a couple of refrigeration modelling tools out there, but I need to use this to show compliance in Canada which in general means EE4.

Anyone have any resources or suggestions to get me pointed in the right direction?

Thanks.

Canmet devellopped a RETSCREEN application for refrigeration.
I did not used it yet but this could be a start.

On our other project we used TRNSYS, Energy + and ESPr.
The main reason was to include thermal mass.  The 
inclusion of thermal mass does a make a 
difference on the capacity of the system and energy consumption.

Dear Christian,  thanks for the info. I was wondering if you knew why these courses are not held online via webinar or similar Platforms? I'm sure lots of pleople would be interested to attend and logistics makes it impossible, both for time and money.

Thanks.
Best, Santiago.

Dear Santiago

They are sometimes just not recently I'm afraid, I'm sure longer term designbuilder will sort out a rolling program of online courses. I'm also giving a 2 day course on using designbuilder in London on 27th & 28th June for tgem, so anyone over this side of the pond can come to London. I think there are still places available.

Paul

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Basement zones in EnergyPlus simulation
Message-ID: <SNT113-W65F75BF064BE3994D644A2C6620@phx.gbl>


Dear All,
 
I've encountered problems in simulating a building with conditioned basement zones.
I've modeled a 8-story building including two basement floors.
After running a simulation, I opened the eso file to see if the equipment was successfully implemented. However, while all the zones except basement zones showed converged temperature upon heating/cooling setpoints, basement zones failed in conditioning. 

Basement zones vary in equipment types: one has fan coil and the others have VAVs. 
I assume that the only factor that brings about the problem is the fact that these zones are underground. 
(I even 'elevated' the model simply to eliminate the underground part of the building, and every single zone succeeded in conditioning.)

Q. Is there a particular object I need to add in order to get the right results regarding conditioned underground floors? 
 
Any help will be much appreciated.
Thank you.
 
 
_Jeong 
 
 
P.S. I am aware of the example file in C:\EnergyPlusV6-0-0\PreProcess, but I'm not sure how I can make good use of the file in this case.

Buildings

 

Dear colleagues, 

 

Some of you and/or your associates might be interested in a three day
executive education program on 'Daylighting Buildings' that we will
again be offering on July 6-8 2011 at Harvard University, Graduate
School of Design. Course participants will acquire a range of
daylighting design analysis techniques ranging from rules of thumb to
state-of-the-art computer simulations and high dynamic range photography
for glare analysis. The main simulation programs used will be Rhino
combined with our DIVA plug-in <http://www.diva-for-rhino.com/>  that
exports Rhino scenes into Radiance, Daysim, Evalglare and - starting
this summer-  EnergyPlus. Simulation outputs include:

-          Daylight factor and indoor illuminance distributions for LEED
IEQ Credit 8.1 Compliance (Radiance)

-          Annual radiation maps for urban studies

-          Climate-based metrics including daylight autonomy and useful
daylight illuminance (Radiance/Daysim)

-          Physically based scene visualizations (Radiance)

-          Glare analysis under selected sky
conditions(Radiance/Evalglare)

-          Annual glare maps (Daysim/Evalglare)

-          Thermal loads calculations (EnergyPlus and Radiance/Daysim)

 

The physical assumptions underlying these simulation programs and
performance metrics will be discussed in detail. The first two days will
consist of formal instructions, in-class discussions, hands-on software
tutorials, and exercises. Day two will start with a lecture on circadian
effects of light by Professor Stephen Lockley form the Harvard Medical
School. Participants will be given the opportunity to calibrate their
personal digital cameras to take HDR images and learn several ways of
how to quantitatively evaluate these images. During the last day,
participants will be given the opportunity to apply the newly acquired
analysis techniques to ongoing projects of their own and to go over
specific problems or simulation challenges with the instructor.

 

You can sign up for the program at

The 50% Savings Advanced Energy Design Guide for K-12 School Buildings (publication this fall, free download available from www.ashrae.org/freeaedg) will include a chapter on EUI targets for schools. This chapter provides a methodology for determining targets for your specific project and provides targets (by end use and climate zone) for reference. The EUI targets that are provided were generated from energy simulations using the DOE reference building schools. A draft of the chapter can be downloaded from ftp://aedgpub:3a$ts!d3 at ftp.ashrae.org. The chapter is provided in DRAFT form and electronic dissemination is limited to Bldg-Sim mailing list members only. This file may not be stored on a computer system for the purpose of additional distribution. A physical copy may be printed from the electronic file only for the personal use of the Bldg-Sim mailing list member. The electronic file will be available through June 30 on the FTP site.

A procedure similar to what Chris outlined will be added to the chapter before publication (it is not currently in the draft). It will discuss a way to set your own energy target based on a project specific energy model. In summary, the steps will be as follows: (1) start with the appropriate DOE reference building school, (2) modify the model to include your schedules and climate information, (3) add specialty space types or unique plug loads that are not captured in the DOE model, and (4) run a simulation in your climate to set your own baseline. Your target is 50% of this EUI.

Any feedback to the draft or this procedure would be very helpful.

Best regards,

Eric

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Energy Model Cost - best design doesn'tequalmost LEED points

All:

I've been intrigued ever since I saw RMI's presentation on how target EUI's were set for the showcase Empire State Building renovation - where an innovative approach was used to define the building's "technical potential to achieve" and then measuring success by the team's ability to deliver a cost effective project than meets the "technical potential to achieve" as much as possible, while balancing all other needs.  Here's a nice summary - http://www.retrofitdepot.org/Content/Files/ESBCaseStudy.pdf

I've been thinking that, in general, re-framing energy performance success (i.e. EA C1 points) not as a "% better than an Appendix G Baseline" but to "% below the building's semi-unique technical potential to achieve" - might have interesting and positive effects.  By that I mean, imagine an office building designed and predicted to consume (on a site EUI basis) an EUI of 89 kBtu/ft2, while the technical potential to achieve might have been determined to be 70 kBtu/ft2.   This represents a (1-(89/70)) = 27% gap, which say falls between 25% and 30% and it worth 3 EA C1 pts.

The ASHRAE Standard 100 Revision Committee has been working with some unique "hybrid" approaches combining "prototype or reference building energy models" and CBECS data to generate regional EUI targets based on building composition, building size, and building operating hours. The proposed revision of ASHRAE Standard 100 (not yet out for public comment) will incorporate a procedure for generating a building specific EUI for setting retrofit performance targets.  Here's a link to a presentation by Terry Sharp where he describes the basic concept under "Option 3" -  http://tc76.org/docs/programs/ASRHAE%20std%20100%20%20Sem%2020102520June_Sharp.ppt Remember that EPA Target Finder is based exclusively on the EPA Portfolio Manager models, which are based on a number of different years of CBECS surveys, dependent on the space type.

It's not too much of a stretch to imagine, following the general principles from above and the methods described in proposed revision to Standard 100, to be able to generate a unique 'semi-custom' EUI for your building project - maybe it might look something like this:

1) Download appropriate DOE prototype model(s)
2) Add appropriate exterior shading (adjacent buildings, etc.)
3) Replace building fabric elements with appropriate benchmark elements for your building type (retrofit / new construction)
4) Replace 'asset' related elements (lights, equipment) with appropriate benchmark elements for your building type  (retrofit / new construction)
4) Generate site EUI results with a weather file for your location.
5) If necessary, combine (area weight) EUI to result in whole building "Potential to Achieve"

In this way, one ends up with a semi-custom EUI performance target to measure success against - a target could be "better defined" than what you can currently get from EAP Target Finder.   I can envision a consensus document which lays out a specifications and procedure for allowable alteration of the DOE models, in order to generate the "Potential to Achieve EUI", after which the % difference from an "As Designed" case translate to EA C1 points.  I know this is NOT the original purpose of the DOE Benchmark Buildings, but with careful thought, and community consensus, I think a process of something like this may move the centroid of the community in the right direction. The energy usage 'goal' would be known as soon as the program was set, and the design team can react from there.  Also, the resulting "As Designed" model could be more useful, at would be meant to represent actual building performance to the best of the knowledge of the design team.

Thoughts?

All the Best,

_Chris

The primary purpose is to get the conversation started, early.  It is an opportunity to educate the owner and the team about energy.  In my experience the majority of designers can?t even tell you the metric for comparing building energy consumption.  I have often had this conversation early in the project design and have been met with blank stares.  It is incumbent upon us who do understand these energy issues to get the conversation started.
Caveat the heck out of the goal, explain the limitations, discuss the relative vs absolute metrics, be open about the issues ? so that we can raise awareness one conversation at a time.  This is the power of a market transformation tool like LEED.  It enables us to have these conversations.



I agree that both of these items are potential issues, talk to your clients about them.  If you don?t have a goal, how do you measure success?

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Energy Model Cost - best design doesn'tequalmost LEED points



While I conceptually agree with and understand the kbtu or watts/sf approach, to me, there seems to be some series issues with it in reality.

First, I don't agree that generating or coming up with appropriate target values during design is always (or even frequently) an easy thing to do or easy data to find.  It depends on your bldg type.  I do a lot of labs and hospitals.  Manufacturing and industrial use bldgs can have the same issues.
Good EUI data is not easy to come by for these bldg types - partly because the user equipment that is installed in them can be a big portion of the energy demand and consumption and it's always changing and can be very specific to each client.  For example: is it a community hosptial with more modest and generic care provide?....a state of the art hospital with specialized care functions?....does the lab have primarily biology or a chemistry functions....etc etc.  These things all affect the EUI.  In my opinion, the best resource for this data is actually utility companies based on data from similar customers, but that data is not generally publicly available and/or the population of similar comparable buildings may be small and difficult to relate to your bldg.

Second, quite frankly, in my opinion, DESIGN phase energy models are poor predictors of ACTUAL bldg energy use.  They are best at predicting RELATIVE
(comparative) energy use.  This is not because the tools are not good or inaccurate but because we and the owners are so poor at predicting how the bldg will actually be used, weather, etc.  One additional factor, is what equipment will actually be installed.  It's not uncommon for the technology to have changed bewteen the time that we start design and the time the equipment is actually purchased closer to the end of construction.  All these things effect not only the equipment w/sf usage but the ac w/sf usage etc.
So, there seems to me to be a serious disconnect to me if we talking about setting energy targets during DESIGNbased on statistical data of ACTUAL energy use and trying to use those figure during the design phase for predicted energy use.  Again, I love the idea but are we really there yet in reality.  It seems to me we need a lot more data that doesn't exist yet - and mechanism to collect that data.  (CBECS etc are good, but the population and variability for bldgs of these types has a long way to go).

I missing something about what's being proposed/talked about?

First of all the goal is not at all arbitrary but must be based on an expected outcome within a reasonable expectation.  It is informed by data from similar, actual building energy consumption.  I don?t think I need to explain the tools one can use to do this.



Your goal (do the best you can) sounds like, ?let?s build an energy efficient building?.  This is meaningless.  Energy efficiency in the context of new construction is always relative and without a quantification of what energy efficient means this is no goal at all.



Like any early stage performance goal the number is adjustable as more is discovered in the design process.  If the target is later discovered to be unreasonable due to a wide range of potential issues, then the target is adjusted.



If you pick your EUI goal the way you describe then yes this is a worthless goal but the key point is that it is never selected arbitrarily.

Not to be a jerk, but to ask an honest question: what is the point?  I?ve been involved with ?established energy target? projects and never really picked up on the logic behind it ? I would appreciate a layman?s explanation.



Put another way:  If you select an arbitrary EUI or watts per square foot at the earliest stages of design, what have you gained in design process?
If/when a project ?meets the goal? mid-design, are future design decisions supposed to de-emphasize energy impact (no!)?  If on the other hand, a project finds that target unreasonable down the road, what then?



Not setting a mile-marker like this implies designing the best building you can given the time/budget available and any other constraints? that seems more likely to result in the best end-result to me.



To draw analogy, if design of a LEED (or any energy-conscious) project is like planning a road trip from Kansas to Florida, setting EUI goals seems something like choosing a rest stop by throwing a dart at the map blindfolded.  It doesn?t help you get to your destination any more efficiently, it may be far out of the way, and now you?ve got a hole in the wall? what was the point?



Okay, maybe a weak analogy ? chalking it up to a very long week =).
Honestly, I?d appreciate someone laying the value behind this approach ? I?m expect the logic does exist, and I just haven?t yet seen the light!

Could any one advice why LEED would not put the base design as Watt per square foot, or per occupant, or per hotel bed etc. so the Architecture becomes more innovative early in the design to save energy?

Arpan,



Based on the Weidt Group paper, I?m guessing you?re emphasizing architectural considerations that affect the energy cost vs. LEED points numbers. (The paper uses window-to-wall ratios and daylighting as an example.) I would think the goal during the programming and schematic design phases should be energy cost, not LEED points relative to the App. G baseline. Much of the energy cost savings vs. App. G baseline (EAc1 points) is going to come later from the mechanical and lighting designs. The suggestions in the paper to establish specific baseline building shapes and glazing percentages would add a LOT more modeling time ? you?d have to create two separate building geometries for the baseline and proposed models, not to mention different zoning patterns, space types, lighting power per space etc.



For mechanical design, once the size and programming of the project is established, the baseline model properties are pretty well set, unless you consider fuel-switching and go between baseline systems 1/3/5/7 to systems 2/4/6/8. One exception I can think of for a design decision that results in higher energy cost but better comparison with the App. G baseline is higher ventilation rates combined with heat recovery in the proposed and no heat recovery in the baseline.



Regards,

Bill

Marcus, thank you incorporating this language.



The one scenario we often see in our design guidance work is that a proposed design when compared with other design alternates does not necessarily provided the largest energy savings when compared against its own baseline case model. It is difficult to make a recommendation as consultants when we want to present the Owner with both real energy cost savings without compromising their LEED certification level targets.

A recent paper presented by the Weidt Group at SimBuild touched on this
issue:

        If anyone has any good ideas about how to structure the LEED credits to end the practice of validation models at the end and encourage/require design phase modeling the folks on the USGBC EA TAG would love to hear them.
The current proposed credit language from the first public comment phase is listed below.



        NC, CS, SCHOOLS, RETAIL, WAREHOUSE & DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, HOSPITALITY

        Establish an energy performance target no later than the schematic design phase. The target must be established as kBTU per square foot-year of source energy use. This target must be mapped on the same scale as the baseline and proposed buildings, if the project follows Option 1.



        OPTION 1. Whole Building Energy Simulation

        Analyze a minimum of at least nine efficiency measures during the design process and account for the results in design decision-making.
Analysis can include energy simulation of efficiency opportunities, application of past energy simulation analyses for similar projects to the project, or application of published data from energy analyses performed for similar projects to the project (such as AEDGs).



        A minimum of six energy efficiency measures focused on load reduction strategies appropriate for the facility must be analyzed. This analysis must be performed during the schematic design phase.



        A minimum of three energy efficiency measures focused on HVAC related strategies must be analyzed (passive measures are acceptable). This analysis must be performed before the conclusion of the design development phase.



        The results of the analysis must be summarized in a brief report or memorandum.





        The next version of LEED will be going out for public comment again in July, I think, so please comment formally as well as discussing here.

        OK, Carol..now you threw the "bait" out there..older than dirt, eh?



        I have done very limited LEED "type" modeling where you compare 20 walls and 40 windows types (well, it seemed that way). Correct me if I am wrong, but a Base model must be built to comply with a certain level of ASHRAE 90.1 (now up to 2010 ??). With all of the nuisances of eQuest 3.64, I am going to build the model from scrathc and put in all the relevant baseline data in by hand.  And, by the way, the ASHRAE baseline model might be an entirely different system.  I am just completing an EPACT evaluation (ASHRAE
90.1-2001) and the Baseline HVAC was screwe chillers, whereas the Actual building was packaged units with Turbocor compressors (ask me how I did that).



        It very much depends on the complexity of the building. A 40,000 sf office or a 500,000 sf hotel with casino facilites.



        I am unfamiliar with the LEED paperwork to be filled out after the modeling has been done. But I would not do anything of this type in under 120 hours, preferably 160 hours. If the client thinks he can do better, let him.



        Contingency, contingency.



        We won't discuss how old CAROL might be..

        Marcus,

        You have inadvertently hit upon why IBPSA worked with ASHRAE to create a BEMP certification. That's Building Energy Modeling Professional (BEMP).

        Some of us who have been in the field for awhile began to worry a couple of years ago when so many new energy modelers began appearing on the listserv with questions. Their questions indicated a lack of training and experience that was worrisome. What made it worrisome was that they didn't seem to realize that they were as inexperienced as they were; they didn't appear to be pursuing training to learn how to do what they were doing; and we were uncertain as to how or if they were practicing quality control. We hoped that by creating a path to certification that we would give clients one more qualification to look for in their modelers.

        If you have been in this industry for any length of time, and by industry I mean the overall construction industry, you know that you don't get a lot of chances if your work doesn't pan out. If your energy model says I have a LEED Gold building and I'm going to save $4,000/year and what I really get is LEED Silver and $1,000/year, I am not going to be happy. So, I will probably not give you any more work but, even worse for all of us, I'll start expressing doubts about the whole process. LEED - what is it good for?

        So, now we all have more training, right? We read our ASHRAE Handbooks and technical manuals so we know how to model the difficult stuff.
We can find any topic in the DOE2 Manuals, all of which are one line, available, and easily searchable.

        So now we are so good we can do these models in 40-80 hours. Really?
Not me and I've been doing it longer than everyone, except you, John Aulbach.
So I'm going to join Marcus in his rant because he's on to something.

        It's up to us to not under bid this work. It's up to us to educate our clients about the importance of quality in this process. If they think they are getting the same analysis in 40 hours that they used to get in 120 hours, they need to be led around to rethinking that and to be reminded that GIGO.

        Cheers,

        Carol

                WARNING ? frustrated modeling rant to follow:



                Doing just a final model however completely misses the point as to why we model ? it is to guide design decisions!



                If I saw this RFP and all it asked me for was a model to determine LEED points, during or after design, I would try to educate the potential client about the purpose of modeling.



                Unfortunately too many projects pursuing LEED are only doing the minimum when it comes to modeling and almost completely missing all the benefits.  Too often the ?market? transforms only based on a least first cost denominator basis that results in little real transformation.  Doing models to determine LEED points does not transform the market, save any energy, and just circumvents the purpose behind LEED. (the next version actually requires design phase modeling!)



                Any ?modeler? who does only final models without attempting to explain to the owner why this is a bad idea should be ?drummed out of the corp? in my humble opinion.



                The problem is that if you respond to this RFP with 120 or
160 or more hours to really do the design phase modeling right, you will go up against the ?modeler? who claims to be able to do it in far less time.  So how do we get the folks who issue the RFPs to ask for a proper scope of work so that they can compare fees on a level playing field?  It is unfortunate that we are even having a discussion about doing modeling work in opposition to its purpose.



                Sorry for the rant but I feel better now. J

                I would expect, for a building this size, approximately 40 hours (multiply by your hourly rate). The 40 hours include EAp2/EAc1 LEED documentation, and any review you may have to respond to later.



                Now, given that you have never done a LEED model, it will take you more time, possibly up to 40 more hours.

                Greetings everyone,



                I have a question regarding the cost of an energy model for a LEED project. Every energy model I've done so far has been for

                existing buildings, mainly for optimization purposes.
However, I received an RFP to model a five-story, 41,500 sq. ft. building

                that's currently on the design phase and is pursuing the LEED-NC Silver certification. I really have no idea what would be a fair

                price for this model since I'm going to have to use Appendix G (ASHRAE 90.1) to evaluate the difference between the base

                and proposed buildings. I don't know how much extra effort this will take. I know the procedure, just haven't done it before.



                Can you shed any light on this issue?



                Thanks in advance!

Message-ID: <FDA1DF6CAA10E04099999C6B152EA1F7065743FD3A@chi01exmb.perkinswill.net>

Hello,

I could REALLY use some help troubleshooting my model.    Many thanks in advance!

I am trying to build an EE4 model of a MURB with hydronic (heating only) radiators off central boilers, with ventilation air ducted to each suite from outside, with no central make-up air unit.  The ventilation air is drawn in using scheduled operation of washroom exhaust fans.   I am modeling the system as 2-pipe fan coil, with zero fan power.

I have worked through the errors, and the simulation will start to run, then freezes and goes unresponsive.  I am able to generate the loads using the sizing function.  No DOE report is generated.  Actually when I try to open the (0 kb) DOE file, I get a D2SimViewer error "Out of memory."

I have been working through the modelling guide to try to determine what could be causing this, but I have not been able to fix the problem.

I am not an expert at EE4, so perhaps there is a model-building convention that I have disobeyed.

Any help would be appreciated!  I am getting a little desperate, and unfortunately need to model in EE4, as this is the only acceptable software for this project.


Kind Regards,
Lilah

Hi Lilah

Well, it looks you are setting up the model on the right trick except for OA
which is not clearly stated. I guess you should still put up central make-up
air unit although no heating source will be applied there. Meanwhile, try to
input calculated fan power (your exhaust fans) into central air unit.

I dislike EE4 since it has a big black box which you can not trace down the
errors. However, I can recall I have encountered similar problems before.
What I did is to check some generated file (I could not remember what files
they are but basically they are generated together with the calculation even
it is incomplete.) where I was able to find out the reason why the system
crash.

No time to check my previous projects but I will let you know which file you
should check if I could recall it.
Regards,

Cheney

Hi Chris,

 

I have a document that submitted to ASHRAE with a clear definition of an

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Hybrid System - Definition?

 

Trying to track down the definition of a hybrid system according to
ashrae. 

Does anyone know where that definition can be found?

Cheers.

I've tried to find a specific definition before with not a whole lot of
luck. We've taken it as pretty much anything at is not purely sourced
from the electrical grid. The example that I always run into is primary
heating using a heat pump with a natural gas fired boiler as
backup/supplemental heat. So it would be an electric/fossil hybrid. If
anyone comes across an official definition I would be interested in
seeing it.

Question on defining lighting power densities in multi-family residential.
Folks who do a lot of multi-family, let me know if this sounds correct on
the LEED side of assumptions.


   1. All common areas 0.7 W/SF in baseline
   2. All living units lighting is process loads, same in both cases
   3. No decorative fixture allowances

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED Template
Message-ID: <BANLkTinG4tV7RiNwuLZJ0gWN6KQ76Ov+GQ@mail.gmail.com>

I just need a clarification, and rather wait for a response from LEED, i
figured i'd ask you guys.  I looked through the archives and couldn't find
anything that adressed this issue.

In the most recent version of the LEED Online template, i have entered in my
unmet hours as follows:

                                 proposed            baseline
unmet heating                 8                         91
unmet cooling                 120                       1

Now, if you sum them up and take the difference you get 128-92 = 36 which is
a pass in my book.  However the LEED Online template is saying that it isn't
a pass because:
91-8 = 83 (Fail)
120-1 = 119 (Fail)

so what i then did was enter in numbers as follows:

                                 proposed            baseline
unmet heating                 299                     250
unmet cooling                 299                     250

This should not be allowed to pass because proposed = 598 and baseline = 500
unmet hours, even the difference is 98 ours, which fails, but the LEED
Online passes this scenario.

Any thoughts or has anyone dealt with this recently?

Hi Rob,
I have had the same problem before for one of our projects. I have taken the
screenshot of section 1.3 in template and submitted it with a narrative to
GBCI explaining whats wrong with the results produced. It seems that there
is some mistake in their program behind that form. I would suggest you to
try the same.

yep.  been around for years.  i've had this problem with leed reviewer's 
interpreting it this way all the way back to leed 2.1 even though 90.1 
is quite clear it is the building design, not heating design separate 
from cooling design.

approach from amit seems best.  does the "contact review team" show up 
somewhere in your leed 3 options?  it might be best to address the 
matter by quoting chapter & verse from 90.1 app g as you should get a 
response faster than from the main usgbc/gbci contact form.

If this is for LEED Energy modeling baseline selection there are a few CIRs that allow you to model  some types of Hybrid systems with an electric baseline if the gas heat source is not predominant.
For example if the OA unit is as heating and everything else is perimeter electric heating, the OA can be treated as preheat gas as long as it is consistent in both baseline and proposed design.

Hi,

can anyone tell me what wind speed is exactly meant in the TMY. Is it the
free, undisturbed wind speed, the wind speed above the roof, the wind speed
at 10 metres above the ground ....

Thanks,

Dear Leen

Most weather data quotes the reference wind speed which is that at 10m above the ground as measured at certain weather stations. Adjustment factors are then made for levels of surface roughness, I.e. urban, rural environments. I think the TMY follows the same convention.

Hi,

can anyone tell me what wind speed is exactly meant in the TMY. Is it the
free, undisturbed wind speed, the wind speed above the roof, the wind speed
at 10 metres above the ground ....

Thanks,

Leen

Hello,



Unfortunately, historical wind speeds on TMY files that come from NOAA data are from peak 5 minute gusts, which can have little correlation to average hourly wind speeds. At some stations integrating sensors have been added, but it will take time to push these data through the average year data base.



In addition, previous work in England using ultrasonic sensors has shown that NOAA data also suffers from severe drop out at speeds less than 5 to 10 MPH, which means that most sites show "0" wind speed, whereas there is actually some wind, but not enough to move the cups on the anemometer. This can be a problem for simulation of natural ventilation.



ASHRAE's TC 4.2 continues to discussed these and other issues, which can be viewed on ASHRAE web page in their meeting minutes.

Dear Leen

Most weather data quotes the reference wind speed which is that at 10m above the ground as measured at certain weather stations. Adjustment factors are then made for levels of surface roughness, I.e. urban, rural environments. I think the TMY follows the same convention.

Hello,

data availibility either for simulation or predictive control is vital.
I was ventilating the idea of non for profit local data centres, collecting an providing data for facility management but also for planning building integrated solar  and wind harvesting.
Having all those web-enabled devices this should not be very costly.

Any progress anyhwere that this idea will materialise? While public administrations sleeping, finally the google boys may take over and we will risk a 100% dependency on them. I just learned that even sketchup is now part of building modeling.

best regards

Gerfried

The data in the newly released NOAA/NCEP/CFSR dataset (which we have built an interface to) for wind speed is the 2 minute average of the wind in the previous hour for that 35-km grid at 10 meters.  This is not an average for the last hour, but is less noisy than the peak readings and it is available hourly for a full 32 years.

Another hybrid system type common out here in the northwest is Packaged VAV with natural gas furnace preheat and electric zone reheat at the terminal units.  It has always been accepted as a hybrid system through many LEED reviews/certifications.

If this is for LEED Energy modeling baseline selection there are a few CIRs that allow you to model  some types of Hybrid systems with an electric baseline if the gas heat source is not predominant. 

For example if the OA unit is as heating and everything else is perimeter electric heating, the OA can be treated as preheat gas as long as it is consistent in both baseline and proposed design.

I've tried to find a specific definition before with not a whole lot of luck. We've taken it as pretty much anything at is not purely sourced from the electrical grid. The example that I always run into is primary heating using a heat pump with a natural gas fired boiler as backup/supplemental heat. So it would be an electric/fossil hybrid. If anyone comes across an official definition I would be interested in seeing it.

Trying to track down the definition of a hybrid system according to ashrae. 

Does anyone know where that definition can be found?

Hi,

A possible source is <http://www.wunderground.com/>http://www.wunderground.com

It looks like private and public weather station 
located around the world and some has wind data.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Fwd: Public Review announcement for addenda to
 ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1
Message-ID: <4DF62E22.7090404@gard.com>

See the announcement below especially related to CJ, R, and W.

Jason

================

The public review of the following addenda started on
Friday, June 10 2010 as announced in the ASHRAE Standards 
Action.

To access the Standards Action, and to review instructions
on how to submit comments on any of these public review
drafts, please go to

http://www.ashrae.org/technology/page/331

30 day public review periods from June 10, 2011 to July
10, 2011:

Addendum L (First Public Review)
This addendum fixes a mistake in Section 6.5.3.1.2 for fan 
brake horsepower methodology.

Addendum n (First Public Review)
The intent of this addendum is to clarify that the total 
lumens/Watt for the entire elevator cab is being required to 
meet the efficiency requirement, but that it is not required 
that each individual light source must comply.

Addendum o (First Public Review)
This addendum updates the fenestration air leakage 
provisions to clarify the requirements for glazed sectional 
garage doors. A new definition for sectional garage doors is 
also added.

Addendum s (First Public Review)
Large amounts of fan energy can be wasted when zones report 
incorrect information to the control system, which causes 
the supply fan speed to increase, often to maximum speed. 
This addendum requires additional safeguards to prevent 
this, and for non-DDC systems requires location of sensors 
in locations that do not require high setpoints.

Addendum t (First Public Review)
This addendum makes corrections 6.5.1.1.4 (Dampers) to 
correct the reference to the proper section for damper 
leakage. In addition this addendum also clarifies that the 
damper leakage requirements in 6.4.3.4.3 (Damper Leakage) 
and as defined in Table 6.4.3.4.3 (Maximum damper leakage) 
applies to the return air dampers used in economizers

Addendum u (Advisory Public Review)
This addendum proposes to add a reference to AMCA Standard 
205-10 to require fan efficiency requirements to be 
classified based on fan efficiency grades.


45 day public review periods from June 10, 2011 to July
25, 2011:

Addendum a (First Public Review)
This addendum updates the test procedure references for 
product information in the Tables in Section 10.8 (product 
information), and also adds a normative reference in Chapter 
12. This will make the table references more consistent with 
other equipment tables (and other test procedure references) 
in the Standard.

Addendum cj (Second Public Review ? ISC)
This addendum modifies Appendix G (Performance Rating 
Method) to change the requirements for economizers and how 
they are modeled in computer rooms.

Addendum m (First Public Review)
This proposal adds power density and control requirements to 
capture additional savings, adds a needed exemption for 
practical application, includes submittal requirements, and 
changes control credits to apply only to lamps in multi-lamp 
fixtures that are controlled.

Addendum q (First Public Review)
This language updates the ASHRAE dynamic glazing definition 
to match the National Fenestration Rating Council dynamic 
glazing definition.

Addendum r (First Public Review)
This addendum clarifies the intent of the committee and 
relocates all wording related to thermostat and humidity 
schedules to the Schedules section of Table G3.1 for greater 
ease of use.

Addendum v (First Public Review)
This proposal requires that the controlled receptacles be 
appropriately identified so that users can clearly 
distinguish between controlled and non-controlled receptacles.

Addendum w (First Public Review)
This addendum clarifies the credits for renewable energy and 
purchased energy in Section 11 (Energy Cost Budget Method) 
and Appendix G (Performance Rating Method)

has an excellent opportunity for an Architectural Simulation Specialist
to work in a dynamic academic research and professional outreach setting
committed to reducing energy use in buildings while supporting high
quality design and ensuring exceptional levels of human comfort.  The
UI-IDL conducts research and outreach projects in areas of energy
efficiency and human factors related to the design and operation of
daylighting, passive and hybrid cooling, and alternative heating and
ventilating systems. Results from research activities feed into
professional collaborations with architects and engineers on new
construction projects and major renovations providing a living
laboratory for the application of new strategies.  Research feeds
practice, practice feeds research, and both mesh with education and
training.

The Architectural Simulation Specialist will lead variety of building
performance simulations including but not limited to solar, daylight,
and energy/thermal aspects of the built environment.  The incumbent will
both lead small projects and work under and coordinate with major
project managers; collaborate with external design teams on performance
analysis; organize and coordinate efforts of Temporary Hourly (Irregular
Help) and student researchers; prepare manuscripts, reports and
presentations to disseminate research results.

The UI-IDL is a member of the Pacific Northwest University Lab Network,
a semi-formal collaborative relationship held between the Boise lab and
labs at the University of Oregon in Eugene and Portland, the University
of Washington in Seattle, Washington State University in Spokane, and
Montana State University in Bozeman. [www.integrateddesignlab.com]

Boise is a growing city in a high desert climate with excellent
proximity to outdoor activities.  It is just a few hours drive to world
class skiing and a few pedals from world class mountain biking.  Boise
was recently ranked by Money Magazine as one of the top ten Best Places
to Live in the US.  Boiseans enjoy four distinct seasons with hot-dry
summers and mild winters, an historic pedestrian-friendly downtown, high
quality of life and relatively low cost of housing.  Centrally located
within the Western United States, Boise is just a quick hop from several
cities including Seattle, Portland, Salt Lake City, Spokane, Las Vegas,
San Francisco, and Denver.  Both positions boast competitive
compensation (see job announcements) and significant latitude to pursue
specialized research in your area of interest and expertise related to
energy use in buildings.

Group,

After doing the energy model of two different systems I was asked to do a
life cycle cost analysis.

I am able to look up every needed value (equipment cost, equipment life,
installation cost, energy cost, inflation rate, fuel costs.)

I can site where I got each number. (right or wrong, I have the source.)

The only missing number is operation and maintenance costs.  Where can I look
up O&M and site the source?

I am comparing a geo-thermal system with a boiler/chiller system.

John,

Having completed numerous LCCA and economic feasibility studies we've also tried to find this sort of information and have found it in short supply.  As Jeremy noted RS Means can serve as a source, albeit a limited one, especially for the many "advanced" systems being evaluated for projects (i.e. chilled beams, VRF, geo, etc.).  Vendors and our clients' maintenance staffs tend to be the most reasonable sources, though there are some challenges there as well.



It would be great to find a more robust O&M cost data set that's publicly shared, especially with data from the likes of BOMA and GSA.  In the meantime, in lieu of having a high level of confidence with numbers you're finding, I would suggest a sensitivity analysis around the O&M costs to help gauge the impact and provide the basis for a "risk & reward" conversation with your client.



Regards,

Paul

So, which is it, I have received LEED Review comments back stating two different ways to calculate fan power and no matter what I do, the next reviewer for the next project sees it differently and has me revise it.


1.       Calculate the baseline fan power from the sum of all the supply, return & exhaust airflows combined to get a total fan power.  Then proportion out the total fan power between each of the fans (supply, return, exhaust, etc).


2.       Calculate the baseline fan power for the supply fan only, and then proportion out the power from that calculation into each of the fans (supply, return, exhaust, etc.)

Method #1 takes all the airflow in all the fans in the building added together, calculates the fan power to move that much air, and then proportions it out to each of the fans.    For example, 100,000 cfm supply air, 90,000 return air and 10,000 exhaust air.  Totals to 200,000 cfm airflow in the building.  Calculate the airflow for the 200,000 cfm and lets say you get 200 kW.  Then you proportion out the fan power between the fans - but the sum is 200 kW of power.

So, method #2 doesn't make sense to me.  You take calculate the amount of power required to blow the supply air (lets say 100,000 cfm, for example) throughout the building (say 100 kW for simplicity), and then say that the 100 kW is then divided out between all the fans in the building, resulting in the supply fan using ? of the power that you calculated it should, and the rest of the power is divided out between each of the other fans in the building.  So you calculate that 100 kW of energy is needed to move 100,000 cfm of air, but then you change your mind and say that the baseline system is actually only going to use 50 kW of energy and the other 50 kW is used in the return and exhaust fans?  That doesn't make sense to me.

So, which is it?  I've received review comments back from LEED stating each of them, for different projects.  It appears to be interpreted differently from different LEED Reviewers so apparently they don't know either.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Balcony Heat Loss
Message-ID: <4C213D54D9CB41C493F1439B7F45863B@MRENG.local>

Hello,

 

When performing energy modeling to determine compliance with the Canadian
Energy Code (MNECB), penetrations through the building envelope must be
taken into account when calculating wall R-values if their area exceeds 2%
of envelope area.  I'm working on a LEED project and trying to calculate the
wall R-value of a Hotel taking into account heat losses from the balconies
which are extensions of the floor slab (balcony penetrations exceed 2% of
envelope area).

 

I realize this is a rather complex heat transfer problem but hope there may
be an easy approximation.  My first thought was to treat them like a
parallel path heat transfer problem: 1/Req = %slab/Rslab + %wall/Rwall but
I'm thinking that may not be fair (perhaps this would be used if you had
concrete studs in the wall).  My other thought is to treat the slab
penetrations as a separate wall type (uninsulated concrete wall) - this
would have a reduced affect on the overall wall R-value.  

 

Does anyone have thoughts on this?

 

Thanks,

Aaron

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Appendix G additional system types
Message-ID: <247F8F3A32315040A92C035CB2B4E5502387B0@PATHMAIL2.pathfinderengineers.com>

I modeled a residence hall on a college campus using ASHRAE 90.1-2004
Appendix G System Type 1 - PTAC, with a system per zone. I received the
following comment from the LEED Reviewer:

"Section G3.1.1 states that additional system type(s) should be used for
the non-residential space types (including corridors, classrooms,
lounges, public living rooms, etc.). The notes at the end of Table
G3.1.1A identify which spaces are considered residential."

The referenced note states, "Residential space types include guest
rooms, living quarters, private living space, and sleeping quarters.
Other building and space types are considered nonresidential."

 

There is 4,000 ft2 of classroom and conference room space. If I include
corridors, common living rooms, lobby, mech/elec/data, stairwells,
storage, common bathrooms and laundry, I would exceed the 20,000 ft2
threshold condition of the G3.1.1 exception.

The example given in the User's Manuals as a qualifying exception is "a
residential tower with retail and restaurants at the base". 

 

Does anyone think this necessitates additional system types? (System 3
presumably, one per zone.)

 

Thanks,

Bill

Jason,

Appendix G is clear in stating that the system total fan power is based on the baseline system maximum design supply fan airflow rate, which is itself determined on the basis of "a supply-air-to-room-air temperature difference of 20?F or the required ventilation air or makeup air, whichever is greater", as per G3.1.2.8.

What is not clear from 90.1-2007 is how you split this total fan power between supply/return/relief/exhaust. 90.1-2010 however add the provision that the "calculated system fan power shall be distributed to supply, return, exhaust, and relief fans in the same proportion as the proposed design."

The accepted workaround is to add another wall type that is comprised of 
12" of just concrete (U = 5.5 W/sq-m C) and has a height equal to your 
slab thickness -- say 6".  So the area would be the wall length x the 
slab thickness.

Not sure if this is clear -- it is better described on page 7-9 of the 
EE4 modelling guide.

Aaron,

 

Uninsulated assemblies are discussed in the User's Manual for ASHRAE
Standard 90.1. Page G-14 of 90.1-2010 User's Manual suggests:

"It is acceptable to model [projecting balconies] as having the depth of
the exterior wall they penetrate. For example, if the wall between the
intermediate floor slabs has a total depth of 8 in. (203mm), then these
assemblies can be modeled as being 8 in. (203 mm) thick. If the concrete
slab that forms the projecting balcony or intermediate floor slab for a
particular floor is 9 in. (229 mm) thick, then this section of the all
would be modeled in the proposed design as a 9 in. (229 mm) high
uninsulated concrete wall that is 8 in. (203 mm) thick."

 

Regards,

Bill

You seem to be directly correlating fan energy consumption and airflow rate.  Remember, fan energy is proportional to the product of airflow rate and differential pressure.

Here are my thoughts:

If we have:
SA fan: 100,000 cfm @ 4"wc
RA fan: 90,000 cfm @ 1" wc
EA fan: 10,000 cfm @ 1" wc

And let's say they result in:

SA fan: 95 KW
RA fan: 20 KW
EA fan: 2 KW

The total airflow of the system is 100,000 cfm, since the RA and EA fan are in series with the SA fan.  Remember, in a series arrangement the differential pressure of the fans are summed, not the airflow quantity; therefore, we meet the LEED criteria that says that the system total fan power is based on the baseline system design supply airflow rate.  The system total fan power, however, is 117 KW, which can be calculated by adding the individual fan's KW together, or by using total system airflow (100,000 cfm) and total system static pressure (5" wc) to calculate total system KW directly.  The system total differential pressure is 5", not 6", because the RA and EA fans are in parallel with each other, and both are in series with the SA fan.

Then I guess you'd simply apply that proportion of fan power (81% for SA fan, 17% for RA fan, and 2% for EA fan) to the proposed system configuration.

Can anyone else confirm?  I haven't done this calculation for LEED before so I am not saying this IS the correct approach.  This is simply my initial reaction to your question.

Thanks,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Fan Power

So, which is it, I have received LEED Review comments back stating two different ways to calculate fan power and no matter what I do, the next reviewer for the next project sees it differently and has me revise it.


1.       Calculate the baseline fan power from the sum of all the supply, return & exhaust airflows combined to get a total fan power.  Then proportion out the total fan power between each of the fans (supply, return, exhaust, etc).


2.       Calculate the baseline fan power for the supply fan only, and then proportion out the power from that calculation into each of the fans (supply, return, exhaust, etc.)

Method #1 takes all the airflow in all the fans in the building added together, calculates the fan power to move that much air, and then proportions it out to each of the fans.    For example, 100,000 cfm supply air, 90,000 return air and 10,000 exhaust air.  Totals to 200,000 cfm airflow in the building.  Calculate the airflow for the 200,000 cfm and lets say you get 200 kW.  Then you proportion out the fan power between the fans - but the sum is 200 kW of power.

So, method #2 doesn't make sense to me.  You take calculate the amount of power required to blow the supply air (lets say 100,000 cfm, for example) throughout the building (say 100 kW for simplicity), and then say that the 100 kW is then divided out between all the fans in the building, resulting in the supply fan using ? of the power that you calculated it should, and the rest of the power is divided out between each of the other fans in the building.  So you calculate that 100 kW of energy is needed to move 100,000 cfm of air, but then you change your mind and say that the baseline system is actually only going to use 50 kW of energy and the other 50 kW is used in the return and exhaust fans?  That doesn't make sense to me.

So, which is it?  I've received review comments back from LEED stating each of them, for different projects.  It appears to be interpreted differently from different LEED Reviewers so apparently they don't know either.

I do think this necessitates one or more additional system types. As for what spaces go on it, I am inclined to say everything but the dorm rooms themselves.  A possible exception could be there depending on how you are conditioning, ventilating, and exhausting the corridors and common bathrooms.  As for what system type(s), that depends on the area and the number of floors.  If you have spaces on four or more floors on a second system type, you probably triggered VAV (system 5 or 6). G3.1.1b might keep some of your spaces (e.g. laundry, mech/elec/data) as CAV (system 3 or 4) based on the peak load or hour criteria.

Good luck,

Hi Bill,

 

Assuming you are treating your building as predominantly residential,
then include a second nonresidential system type if nonresidential
spaces total more than 20,000SF.  

 

Assuming you are treating your building as predominantly nonresidential,
then include a second residential system type if residential spaces
total more than 20,000SF.  

 

"Residential spaces" are exclusively "guest rooms, living quarters,
private living space, and sleeping quarters" per the notes under the
system type table.  Laundry rooms and similar don't count, if the
reviewer is taking a very literal interpretation.

 

This is one of those cases where you could possibly support either
course of action... if the numbers work out.

I agree with the approach that corridors and bathrooms in the dorm portion
will be operating continuously, and wouldn?t necessarily share a
schedule/system with the classrooms and supporting areas.



I?d consider corridors and stairwells that support the dorms to be part of
that usage, and spaces that support the classrooms and non-residential usage
to be allocated there, going through the system selection table on their
own.

Jason,

ASHRAE 90.1 2007 (and 2004) uses CFMs = "the baseline system maximum design supply fan airflow rate in cfm"

So it should be method 2. As Michael points out, you're not actually calculating the amount of power it takes  to supply 100,000 cfm.  You're calculating your "system allowance" based on that supply / total system airflow.  The calculations already are based on the idea that a supply of that quantity will have to return and/or exhaust that quantity as well.

The Advanced Energy Modeling for LEED manual also points out that  a common error is "Additional fan power allowance is claimed in baseline for return, exhaust, or relief fans".

Thank you to all who commented.  It makes more sense now that the calculated fan power is more of a building or system "allowance", not an actual calculation of power to move the air.  I'll stick to that method.

Jason,

ASHRAE 90.1 2007 (and 2004) uses CFMs = "the baseline system maximum design supply fan airflow rate in cfm"

So it should be method 2. As Michael points out, you're not actually calculating the amount of power it takes  to supply 100,000 cfm.  You're calculating your "system allowance" based on that supply / total system airflow.  The calculations already are based on the idea that a supply of that quantity will have to return and/or exhaust that quantity as well.

The Advanced Energy Modeling for LEED manual also points out that  a common error is "Additional fan power allowance is claimed in baseline for return, exhaust, or relief fans".

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Fan Power

You seem to be directly correlating fan energy consumption and airflow rate.  Remember, fan energy is proportional to the product of airflow rate and differential pressure.

Here are my thoughts:

If we have:
SA fan: 100,000 cfm @ 4"wc
RA fan: 90,000 cfm @ 1" wc
EA fan: 10,000 cfm @ 1" wc

And let's say they result in:

SA fan: 95 KW
RA fan: 20 KW
EA fan: 2 KW

The total airflow of the system is 100,000 cfm, since the RA and EA fan are in series with the SA fan.  Remember, in a series arrangement the differential pressure of the fans are summed, not the airflow quantity; therefore, we meet the LEED criteria that says that the system total fan power is based on the baseline system design supply airflow rate.  The system total fan power, however, is 117 KW, which can be calculated by adding the individual fan's KW together, or by using total system airflow (100,000 cfm) and total system static pressure (5" wc) to calculate total system KW directly.  The system total differential pressure is 5", not 6", because the RA and EA fans are in parallel with each other, and both are in series with the SA fan.

Then I guess you'd simply apply that proportion of fan power (81% for SA fan, 17% for RA fan, and 2% for EA fan) to the proposed system configuration.

Can anyone else confirm?  I haven't done this calculation for LEED before so I am not saying this IS the correct approach.  This is simply my initial reaction to your question.

Thanks,
Michael Eustice, PE, LEED AP

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Fan Power

So, which is it, I have received LEED Review comments back stating two different ways to calculate fan power and no matter what I do, the next reviewer for the next project sees it differently and has me revise it.


1.       Calculate the baseline fan power from the sum of all the supply, return & exhaust airflows combined to get a total fan power.  Then proportion out the total fan power between each of the fans (supply, return, exhaust, etc).


2.       Calculate the baseline fan power for the supply fan only, and then proportion out the power from that calculation into each of the fans (supply, return, exhaust, etc.)

Method #1 takes all the airflow in all the fans in the building added together, calculates the fan power to move that much air, and then proportions it out to each of the fans.    For example, 100,000 cfm supply air, 90,000 return air and 10,000 exhaust air.  Totals to 200,000 cfm airflow in the building.  Calculate the airflow for the 200,000 cfm and lets say you get 200 kW.  Then you proportion out the fan power between the fans - but the sum is 200 kW of power.

So, method #2 doesn't make sense to me.  You take calculate the amount of power required to blow the supply air (lets say 100,000 cfm, for example) throughout the building (say 100 kW for simplicity), and then say that the 100 kW is then divided out between all the fans in the building, resulting in the supply fan using ? of the power that you calculated it should, and the rest of the power is divided out between each of the other fans in the building.  So you calculate that 100 kW of energy is needed to move 100,000 cfm of air, but then you change your mind and say that the baseline system is actually only going to use 50 kW of energy and the other 50 kW is used in the return and exhaust fans?  That doesn't make sense to me.

So, which is it?  I've received review comments back from LEED stating each of them, for different projects.  It appears to be interpreted differently from different LEED Reviewers so apparently they don't know either.

Dear all

We are designing a VAV system for an Office building in Composite climate .
Toilets and pantries have exhaust with heat recovery. So while providing
modulated air through VAV box to a Toilet or Pantry, where there is Exhaust,
could lead to negative pressure. So should VAV be provided for such zones
(toilets and pantries) where there is exhaust with heat recovery

Have any of you run into a review team telling you that you must model the baseline fan supply volume and baseline fan power the same in the proposed design? I have a project under review that is a distribution center primarily served by heating only make up air units. I have modeled cooling in both models and modeled the setpoint high enough that it would never turn on. 

 

My interpretation of the requirement to model cooling the same in both models if cooling does not exist on the proposed design is just that, you only model the cooling the same. However, this is the response we received after our initial design comments review:

 

2. The response narrative to preliminary comment 5 states that the baseline case was modeled with a fan supply volume determined using Section G3.1.2.8 and a fan power determined using Section G3.1.2.9; however the proposed case must also be determined using these parameters.  Per Table G3.1.10(d) in the proposed building column, where no cooling system exists, it must be modeled identically to the baseline case.  Because the fan supply volume and fan power are cooling driven, it is unacceptable to auto-size the baseline case fan supply volume and fan power and not auto-size the proposed case fan supply volume and fan power.  Currently, the baseline fan supply volume is sized to meet cooling needs and the proposed fan supply volume is sized to meet heating and ventilation needs.  If appealing this credit, revise the Proposed case fan supply volume and fan power so that they are determined using Section G3.1.2.8 and Section G3.1.2.9.  Note that it is appropriate for the proposed fans to be modeled as VAV since HVAC System 7 applies.  Additionally, provide SV-A reports confirming the changes.

 

Another comment we received claimed that we must model the 0.4 CFM/SF requirement on the proposed model because the airflows are sized based on cooling and therefore, the airflow rules from System 7 apply (i.e. 20 delta T, min flow requirements, etc.)

 

3. The response narrative to preliminary comment 12 states that the full load equivalent hours are so high due to the 0.4 cfm/sq.ft flow rate; however the 0.4 cfm/sq.ft rate applies only when the building is occupied or when the interior fans are cycled on during unoccupied hours to meet heating or cooling loads.  Based on the information provided in Section 1.2 of the Prerequisite form the occupied hours are only 40 per week.  If appealing this credit, revise the schedules in both cases to reflect the actual anticipated schedules of the interior fans installed in the building.  Additionally, revise the baseline case (and proposed case as necessary for equipment auto-sized per Table G3.1.10(d)) so that the 0.4 cfm/sq.ft minimum flow rate applies only when the building is occupied or when they are cycled on. 

 

I already took care of the scheduling of the when the fans turned on. However, I honestly feel like the rest of both comments step over the line in terms of what we are suppose to model on the proposed design. The changes we would need to make (primarily forcing the airflows to be sized the same as the baseline and 0.4 cfm/sq ft) do not represent the design intent of the system shown on the drawings.

 

What do you guys think?

Will,

 

This reviewer appears to be seriously confused and has applied baseline rules to your proposed design model. 

 

You can do whatever you want with the fan sizing in the proposed model, so long as your have use identical space conditioning set points and schedules and results are within stated limits for maximum unmet load hours and you do not exceed the maximum difference in unmet hours between the baseline and proposed. This is to prevent you from having a proposed design that is under-cooled or under heated relative to the baseline.

 

Similarly, the 0.4 CFM/SF requirement is for the baseline model, not the proposed.

 

Regards,

Timothy

Hi all,

I know this is not the best place to ask this question but hopefully someone
in this list had the same problem before and can help me.

I'm trying to automate the process of importing, meshing and running a CFD
simulation for a parametric study for a building. In an iterative process,
geometry is continuously being updated, re-generated, and re-tested.
So far I am able to create the geometry, import it in DesignModeler and
export the Mesh. The only problem is DesignModeler considered the body as a
"solid" by default but I need to change it to fluid.
I wonder if anybody did it before either by changing the default or changing
the created geometry.
I have tried to change it using JavaScript, Python and find a way to change
the default in DesignModeler, but with no luck so far.

Will,

I actually think that the reviewer has a point here.  Your proposed design
has no cooling, therefore, the proposed design needs to have a cooling
system that is the same as the baseline system.  The airflows don't have to
be equal, but they have to be determined in the same fashion (auto-sizing
with a minimum flow of 0.4 cfm/sf).  HOWEVER, these rules should only apply
to the system in cooling mode. When in heating mode, the system can reflect
the designed values.

Will,

 

First, note that the 2010 version of ASHRAE 90.1 PRM includes two new systems for heat & vent only, and these apply to certain warehouse/storage space types. This is intended to address projects like yours and may apply to certain areas of your distribution center. However, as you're already committed to an earlier version, you're stuck with a challenging situation.

 

Karen does have a point, however... While I was reading fast and missed the bit about there being no cooling system in the proposed design or certain portions thereof, the reviewer is still not correct in asking you to model your proposed design with cooling supply airflow and minimum flows the same as the baseline model. Requiring the presence of a cooling system with suitably sized equipment is different than requiring you to run a fan with a minimum airflow that does not exist. 

 

Indeed, Table G3.1 section 10d does state that "Where no cooling system exists or no cooling system has been specified, the cooling system shall be identical to the system modeled in the baseline building design." Autosizing is an appropriate way to set this up such that equipment is adequately sized to meet all cooling loads present under design conditions and that the cooling airflow can vary between the design flow rate and 0.4 cfm/sf. However, when it comes to modeling the actual proposed fan power and supply airflow in the simulation, if the building has only heating and ventilation, and no cooling system, it should most definitely not be simulated with 0.4 cfm/sf minimum supply airflow, or you will clearly not account for the benefit of having a heat & vent only system in the proposed design. Your ventilation system provides the continuous operation during occupied hours that is required by section G3.1.2.4 Fan System Operation. The 0.4 cfm/sf flow rate should be the minimum during all occupied hours for a VAV system where required in the baseline model, and it should be the minimum in the proposed model when cooling is required to avoid unmet load hours.

 

As Karen has suggested, you can set up the model so that the "identical system" applies only in cooling mode, including autosizing, fan efficiency, etc. And, if cooling mode is never actually triggered, then this will never run. This requires separate fans, and so forth, and could be a bit messy when it comes to properly modeling ventilation and minimum airflows. 

 

I would suggest, and this depends upon the software you are using, that in your proposed design you model the complete proposed system for heating and ventilation, as designed, PLUS the same system as in the baseline model (autosized and all) serving ALL of the same zones, but with no OA ventilation, no heating, and no minimum airflow. In effect, every zone in the proposed model that does not have a cooling system in the real building would be modeled with two systems serving the same zone: One for heat & vent, the other for cooling. Then, as you have said, if the setpoints are equally high in both proposed and baseline models, the cooling will not need to run anyway and unmet cooling load hours will not be an issue.

 

Really, this is just a lot of extra work to prove that you do not need a cooling system in the proposed design to provide the indoor environmental conditions set forth in the design documents, or to suitably penalize your proposed design model if you actually do need cooling to maintain the owner's required setpoints. On the other hand, if you are raising your cooling setpoints and the simulated results include indoor conditions or duration thereof that would not be acceptable to the building owner, then you would not be simulating the true as-built design (assuming that the owner would make you change the design if it appears that the building is going to get too hot too much of the time).

Will,

 

I actually think that the reviewer has a point here.  Your proposed design has no cooling, therefore, the proposed design needs to have a cooling system that is the same as the baseline system.  The airflows don't have to be equal, but they have to be determined in the same fashion (auto-sizing with a minimum flow of 0.4 cfm/sf).  HOWEVER, these rules should only apply to the system in cooling mode. When in heating mode, the system can reflect the designed values.

Will,

 

This reviewer appears to be seriously confused and has applied baseline rules to your proposed design model. 

 

You can do whatever you want with the fan sizing in the proposed model, so long as your have use identical space conditioning set points and schedules and results are within stated limits for maximum unmet load hours and you do not exceed the maximum difference in unmet hours between the baseline and proposed. This is to prevent you from having a proposed design that is under-cooled or under heated relative to the baseline.

 

Similarly, the 0.4 CFM/SF requirement is for the baseline model, not the proposed.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modeling Same Airflow on Proposed and Baseline Models

 

Have any of you run into a review team telling you that you must model the baseline fan supply volume and baseline fan power the same in the proposed design? I have a project under review that is a distribution center primarily served by heating only make up air units. I have modeled cooling in both models and modeled the setpoint high enough that it would never turn on. 

 

My interpretation of the requirement to model cooling the same in both models if cooling does not exist on the proposed design is just that, you only model the cooling the same. However, this is the response we received after our initial design comments review:

 

2. The response narrative to preliminary comment 5 states that the baseline case was modeled with a fan supply volume determined using Section G3.1.2.8 and a fan power determined using Section G3.1.2.9; however the proposed case must also be determined using these parameters.  Per Table G3.1.10(d) in the proposed building column, where no cooling system exists, it must be modeled identically to the baseline case.  Because the fan supply volume and fan power are cooling driven, it is unacceptable to auto-size the baseline case fan supply volume and fan power and not auto-size the proposed case fan supply volume and fan power.  Currently, the baseline fan supply volume is sized to meet cooling needs and the proposed fan supply volume is sized to meet heating and ventilation needs.  If appealing this credit, revise the Proposed case fan supply volume and fan power so that they are determined using Section G3.1.2.8 and Section G3.1.2.9.  Note that it is appropriate for the proposed fans to be modeled as VAV since HVAC System 7 applies.  Additionally, provide SV-A reports confirming the changes.

 

Another comment we received claimed that we must model the 0.4 CFM/SF requirement on the proposed model because the airflows are sized based on cooling and therefore, the airflow rules from System 7 apply (i.e. 20 delta T, min flow requirements, etc.)

 

3. The response narrative to preliminary comment 12 states that the full load equivalent hours are so high due to the 0.4 cfm/sq.ft flow rate; however the 0.4 cfm/sq.ft rate applies only when the building is occupied or when the interior fans are cycled on during unoccupied hours to meet heating or cooling loads.  Based on the information provided in Section 1.2 of the Prerequisite form the occupied hours are only 40 per week.  If appealing this credit, revise the schedules in both cases to reflect the actual anticipated schedules of the interior fans installed in the building.  Additionally, revise the baseline case (and proposed case as necessary for equipment auto-sized per Table G3.1.10(d)) so that the 0.4 cfm/sq.ft minimum flow rate applies only when the building is occupied or when they are cycled on. 

 

I already took care of the scheduling of the when the fans turned on. However, I honestly feel like the rest of both comments step over the line in terms of what we are suppose to model on the proposed design. The changes we would need to make (primarily forcing the airflows to be sized the same as the baseline and 0.4 cfm/sq ft) do not represent the design intent of the system shown on the drawings.

 

What do you guys think?

Thanks for all the feedback! Timothy, you gotta stop working so darn late!!

 

I was thinking that I could respond to the comments stating that ASHRAE 90.1-2007 states that cooling capacities are suppose to be the same, airflows do not necessary have to be equal. I left out the part of the review that frustrated me the most:

 

Due to these issues, the fan power consumption energy value in the Proposed model will be set equal to the fan power consumption energy value in the Baseline model; therefore the revised total electric consumption for the Proposed model will be increased by 2,451,577.5 kWh (3,565,295.5 kWh - 1,113,718 kWh), and the total energy cost for the Proposed model must be increased by $171,610.4 (2,451,577.5 kWh * $0.07/kWh)

 

The revised Proposed total energy cost is $ 367,627.8 ($196,017.42 + $171,610.4). This leads to a total percentage cost savings improvement of 19.8%.

 

The total predicted annual energy consumption for the project is 4,411,526.5 kWh (electricity) and 66,091 therms (natural gas).

 

Basically, they went with the assumption that fan energy consumption must be equal on both and forced us to accept results they feel are correct.

 

However, I'll be a little more constructive and will have to figure out how to resolve this issue on eQuest...

Will,

 

At the risk of confusing things even further, I recently received the following LEED review comment for a LEED 2.2 project:

"Any heated-only spaces in the Proposed building must be modeled as heating-only in both buildings or as heated and cooled in both buildings. Please revise the Proposed and Baseline buildings as necessary to model the heated-only spaces identically in both buildings, and update the template accordingly. Although not required, it is encouraged that the ASHRAE 90.1-2010 Appendix G modeling protocols for heated-only spaces be followed using System Type 9."

 

As Timothy mentioned, System Type 9 would appear to apply to your case, and my LEED Reviewer's comment gives you a basis for modeling both baseline and proposed as heating only if you choose to, even though that option was not available until 90.1-2010.

 

Regards,

Bill

Thanks for all the feedback! Timothy, you gotta stop working so darn late!!

 

I was thinking that I could respond to the comments stating that ASHRAE 90.1-2007 states that cooling capacities are suppose to be the same, airflows do not necessary have to be equal. I left out the part of the review that frustrated me the most:

 

Due to these issues, the fan power consumption energy value in the Proposed model will be set equal to the fan power consumption energy value in the Baseline model; therefore the revised total electric consumption for the Proposed model will be increased by 2,451,577.5 kWh (3,565,295.5 kWh - 1,113,718 kWh), and the total energy cost for the Proposed model must be increased by $171,610.4 (2,451,577.5 kWh * $0.07/kWh)

 

The revised Proposed total energy cost is $ 367,627.8 ($196,017.42 + $171,610.4). This leads to a total percentage cost savings improvement of 19.8%.

 

The total predicted annual energy consumption for the project is 4,411,526.5 kWh (electricity) and 66,091 therms (natural gas).

 

Basically, they went with the assumption that fan energy consumption must be equal on both and forced us to accept results they feel are correct.

 

However, I'll be a little more constructive and will have to figure out how to resolve this issue on eQuest...

Will,

 

First, note that the 2010 version of ASHRAE 90.1 PRM includes two new systems for heat & vent only, and these apply to certain warehouse/storage space types. This is intended to address projects like yours and may apply to certain areas of your distribution center. However, as you're already committed to an earlier version, you're stuck with a challenging situation.

 

Karen does have a point, however... While I was reading fast and missed the bit about there being no cooling system in the proposed design or certain portions thereof, the reviewer is still not correct in asking you to model your proposed design with cooling supply airflow and minimum flows the same as the baseline model. Requiring the presence of a cooling system with suitably sized equipment is different than requiring you to run a fan with a minimum airflow that does not exist. 

 

Indeed, Table G3.1 section 10d does state that "Where no cooling system exists or no cooling system has been specified, the cooling system shall be identical to the system modeled in the baseline building design." Autosizing is an appropriate way to set this up such that equipment is adequately sized to meet all cooling loads present under design conditions and that the cooling airflow can vary between the design flow rate and 0.4 cfm/sf. However, when it comes to modeling the actual proposed fan power and supply airflow in the simulation, if the building has only heating and ventilation, and no cooling system, it should most definitely not be simulated with 0.4 cfm/sf minimum supply airflow, or you will clearly not account for the benefit of having a heat & vent only system in the proposed design. Your ventilation system provides the continuous operation during occupied hours that is required by section G3.1.2.4 Fan System Operation. The 0.4 cfm/sf flow rate should be the minimum during all occupied hours for a VAV system where required in the baseline model, and it should be the minimum in the proposed model when cooling is required to avoid unmet load hours.

 

As Karen has suggested, you can set up the model so that the "identical system" applies only in cooling mode, including autosizing, fan efficiency, etc. And, if cooling mode is never actually triggered, then this will never run. This requires separate fans, and so forth, and could be a bit messy when it comes to properly modeling ventilation and minimum airflows. 

 

I would suggest, and this depends upon the software you are using, that in your proposed design you model the complete proposed system for heating and ventilation, as designed, PLUS the same system as in the baseline model (autosized and all) serving ALL of the same zones, but with no OA ventilation, no heating, and no minimum airflow. In effect, every zone in the proposed model that does not have a cooling system in the real building would be modeled with two systems serving the same zone: One for heat & vent, the other for cooling. Then, as you have said, if the setpoints are equally high in both proposed and baseline models, the cooling will not need to run anyway and unmet cooling load hours will not be an issue.

 

Really, this is just a lot of extra work to prove that you do not need a cooling system in the proposed design to provide the indoor environmental conditions set forth in the design documents, or to suitably penalize your proposed design model if you actually do need cooling to maintain the owner's required setpoints. On the other hand, if you are raising your cooling setpoints and the simulated results include indoor conditions or duration thereof that would not be acceptable to the building owner, then you would not be simulating the true as-built design (assuming that the owner would make you change the design if it appears that the building is going to get too hot too much of the time).

Will,

 

I actually think that the reviewer has a point here.  Your proposed design has no cooling, therefore, the proposed design needs to have a cooling system that is the same as the baseline system.  The airflows don't have to be equal, but they have to be determined in the same fashion (auto-sizing with a minimum flow of 0.4 cfm/sf).  HOWEVER, these rules should only apply to the system in cooling mode. When in heating mode, the system can reflect the designed values.

Will,

 

This reviewer appears to be seriously confused and has applied baseline rules to your proposed design model. 

 

You can do whatever you want with the fan sizing in the proposed model, so long as your have use identical space conditioning set points and schedules and results are within stated limits for maximum unmet load hours and you do not exceed the maximum difference in unmet hours between the baseline and proposed. This is to prevent you from having a proposed design that is under-cooled or under heated relative to the baseline.

 

Similarly, the 0.4 CFM/SF requirement is for the baseline model, not the proposed.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modeling Same Airflow on Proposed and Baseline Models

 

Have any of you run into a review team telling you that you must model the baseline fan supply volume and baseline fan power the same in the proposed design? I have a project under review that is a distribution center primarily served by heating only make up air units. I have modeled cooling in both models and modeled the setpoint high enough that it would never turn on. 

 

My interpretation of the requirement to model cooling the same in both models if cooling does not exist on the proposed design is just that, you only model the cooling the same. However, this is the response we received after our initial design comments review:

 

2. The response narrative to preliminary comment 5 states that the baseline case was modeled with a fan supply volume determined using Section G3.1.2.8 and a fan power determined using Section G3.1.2.9; however the proposed case must also be determined using these parameters.  Per Table G3.1.10(d) in the proposed building column, where no cooling system exists, it must be modeled identically to the baseline case.  Because the fan supply volume and fan power are cooling driven, it is unacceptable to auto-size the baseline case fan supply volume and fan power and not auto-size the proposed case fan supply volume and fan power.  Currently, the baseline fan supply volume is sized to meet cooling needs and the proposed fan supply volume is sized to meet heating and ventilation needs.  If appealing this credit, revise the Proposed case fan supply volume and fan power so that they are determined using Section G3.1.2.8 and Section G3.1.2.9.  Note that it is appropriate for the proposed fans to be modeled as VAV since HVAC System 7 applies.  Additionally, provide SV-A reports confirming the changes.

 

Another comment we received claimed that we must model the 0.4 CFM/SF requirement on the proposed model because the airflows are sized based on cooling and therefore, the airflow rules from System 7 apply (i.e. 20 delta T, min flow requirements, etc.)

 

3. The response narrative to preliminary comment 12 states that the full load equivalent hours are so high due to the 0.4 cfm/sq.ft flow rate; however the 0.4 cfm/sq.ft rate applies only when the building is occupied or when the interior fans are cycled on during unoccupied hours to meet heating or cooling loads.  Based on the information provided in Section 1.2 of the Prerequisite form the occupied hours are only 40 per week.  If appealing this credit, revise the schedules in both cases to reflect the actual anticipated schedules of the interior fans installed in the building.  Additionally, revise the baseline case (and proposed case as necessary for equipment auto-sized per Table G3.1.10(d)) so that the 0.4 cfm/sq.ft minimum flow rate applies only when the building is occupied or when they are cycled on. 

 

I already took care of the scheduling of the when the fans turned on. However, I honestly feel like the rest of both comments step over the line in terms of what we are suppose to model on the proposed design. The changes we would need to make (primarily forcing the airflows to be sized the same as the baseline and 0.4 cfm/sq ft) do not represent the design intent of the system shown on the drawings.

 

What do you guys think?

Bill,

 

Seems like that will be the new default advice on how to deal with a lot of these warehouse/storage type facilities that have heating only. It makes a lot more sense than manipulating with the airflows on the proposed design.

 

Since the project has already been submitted and we are already at the Final Design Review stage, I probably won't change the system types in order to prevent even more confusion for the review team.

Per Table G3.1.10(d) in the proposed building column, where no cooling system exists, it must be modeled identically to the baseline case.  Because the fan supply volume and fan power are cooling driven, it is unacceptable to auto-size the baseline case fan supply volume and fan power and not auto-size the proposed case fan supply volume and fan power.  Currently, the baseline fan supply volume is sized to meet cooling needs and the proposed fan supply volume is sized to meet heating and ventilation needs.  If appealing this credit, revise the Proposed case fan supply volume and fan power so that they are determined using Section G3.1.2.8 and Section G3.1.2.9.  Note that it is appropriate for the proposed fans to be modeled as VAV since HVAC System 7 applies.  Additionally, provide SV-A reports confirming the changes.

 

Another comment we received claimed that we must model the 0.4 CFM/SF requirement on the proposed model because the airflows are sized based on cooling and therefore, the airflow rules from System 7 apply (i.e. 20 delta T, min flow requirements, etc.)

 

3. The response narrative to preliminary comment 12 states that the full load equivalent hours are so high due to the 0.4 cfm/sq.ft flow rate; however the 0.4 cfm/sq.ft rate applies only when the building is occupied or when the interior fans are cycled on during unoccupied hours to meet heating or cooling loads.  Based on the information provided in Section 1.2 of the Prerequisite form the occupied hours are only 40 per week.  If appealing this credit, revise the schedules in both cases to reflect the actual anticipated schedules of the interior fans installed in the building.  Additionally, revise the baseline case (and proposed case as necessary for equipment auto-sized per Table G3.1.10(d)) so that the 0.4 cfm/sq.ft minimum flow rate applies only when the building is occupied or when they are cycled on. 

 

I already took care of the scheduling of the when the fans turned on. However, I honestly feel like the rest of both comments step over the line in terms of what we are suppose to model on the proposed design. The changes we would need to make (primarily forcing the airflows to be sized the same as the baseline and 0.4 cfm/sq ft) do not represent the design intent of the system shown on the drawings.

 

What do you guys think?

I don't believe that the airflows between the proposed and baseline
designs need to be equal. System sizing and fan sizing needs to be
determined in the same way, but there are many things that affect
airflow and peak demand that may very well be different in the
proposed and baseline models, LPD, glass types, etc, although sizing
in the end may be determined by the 0.4 cfm/sf number. Also, when the
system is in heating mode, the as-designed fan power and flow should
be used. The last comment you just shared with us is definitely
incorrect.

FYI. 

The DOE2.1e manual had extensive discussions on how to create curve fits and it would even run the regressions for you. In this section in the manual there is a table that explains the basic curve types. 

You can also roll your own curve-fits using a spreadsheet by performing a multiple, non-linear regression and plug the coefficients back into DOE-2. Care should be taken to properly hand cross-variables, etc. 

The final report fro ASHRAE RP1007 also discussed curve fits.

Well, personally I believe it is risky to "work out" a ballpark number
for any given project even at the schematic design stage since ggeothermal
design is very project specific. We are using  GLD2010 and I noticed that
the design is govern by many parameters, such as soil condition (which is
very project specific), borehole number and grid arrangement (for
example, different grid arrangements with same borehole number will give you
totally different results), heating and cooling balance (which is easily to
be ignored at schematic design stage), fluid and U-tube characteristics,
etc. Meanwhile, the ground temperature variation is a long dynamic process
which will keep changing until it reaches a new balance over a long period
of time. All of these will affect your HVAC design significantly.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] equest zoning approaches
Message-ID: <20110622175037.996DF8DB0914@zapata.dreamhost.com>

I am wondering how the typical equest model is zoned.  Two scenarios:

1.  Create a zoning diagram combining like spaces on perimeters and 
like spaces in interiors based on the HVAC type and 
distribution.  Combine storage rooms with exhaust only with adjacent 
space where the transfer air comes from, etc.  Plunk this zoning 
diagram into equest.

2.  Plunk the architectural drawing into equest and every space 
becomes an equest space - every closet, elevator/duct shaft, office, 
small interior meeting room, janitor closets - all a space in equest.

I had always assumed that the scenario 1 would be used.  I am now 
finding (by way of reviewing LEED submissions) that many people use 
scenario 2.  It seems very inefficient to me and certainly increases 
the cost of doing a review.

What is typical?

Hi Chris,

If you want to get your project done in time and within the budget I would
highly recommend Scenario 1. I think that Scenario 2 is a result of not
thinking the zoning through before doing the take-offs from CAD drawings.

When I start a model I spend a few hours at least looking at what's going on
in the building: what are the mechanical zones, wall constructions, roof
constructions, floor plans - where do you have an exposed roof due to the
floor above having a smaller foot print, do the floor to floor heights vary,
etc., etc. If you don't do this you can really create a nightmare for later.

Cheers,

Carol

Ideally it would be option one as this would be easiest for both modeler and reviewer, however more and more it is becoming option two. Here are a few reasons why:
 - If the LEED model has been developed in DD the architectural layouts could change. It is therefore easier to provide more rooms in the model so that layout changes are easier to deal with without having to redo the model
 - Space by Space method lighting requires the modeling of storage rooms etc
 - The few building I have worked on for LEED have primarily perimeter spaces. Therefore it is harder to clump like rooms together due to orientation differences.
 - To accurately model the building area it is easier to model some unconditioned spaces so that these can be included or taken out of the area calcs. 
 - To more accurately model VAV boxes zones need to be broken out

Subject: [Bldg-sim] equest zoning approaches

I am wondering how the typical equest model is zoned.  Two scenarios:

1.  Create a zoning diagram combining like spaces on perimeters and like spaces in interiors based on the HVAC type and distribution.  Combine storage rooms with exhaust only with adjacent space where the transfer air comes from, etc.  Plunk this zoning diagram into equest.

2.  Plunk the architectural drawing into equest and every space becomes an equest space - every closet, elevator/duct shaft, office, small interior meeting room, janitor closets - all a space in equest.

I had always assumed that the scenario 1 would be used.  I am now finding (by way of reviewing LEED submissions) that many people use scenario 2.  It seems very inefficient to me and certainly increases the cost of doing a review.

What is typical?

Hi Chris,

We always use scenario 1,

This is their 3rd release version. I have used it before and have not
been very impressed with the way it interfaces with Energyplus and the
IDF files it produces. Also in the past many HVAC features had been left
out. The impressive feature was always the geometry builder but with
where OpenStudio is now it doesn't compete on the geometry side of
things.

I have not downloaded the new GUI yet (I'm at Disney World J), but this is
supposed to be a major upgrade to the HVAC par, with drag and drop HVAC
loops and other improvements; I think it's probably worth looking at.

Dear all,

The minimum efficiency values in ASHRAE 90.1-Tables 6.8.1 are applied to the
HVAC generator (i.e: boiler, chiller, heat pump) or to the whole system?
I'm modeling a Heat Pump VRF condenser with a series of indoor units which
would influence the heat pump's COP if taken into consideration.
Thank you in advance.

Does anyone knows if TRNSYS has a water-to-water heat pump with dual compressor capability?

The water-to-water heat pump I remember is a single-stage unit from TESS.

Demba,
   The most recent version of the TESS Libraries (v17) contains a 
2-stage water-to-water heat pump. There are also some multi-stage 
controller components available as well.

Message-ID: <4E0A5154.8080003@jilldalglish.com>

Hello,

I am trying a simple DD wizard mode comparison of one building with 
occupancy in all zones and one building with occupancy only in the 
southern half of the building and am getting no change in results.

I am doing this by changing the occupancy from the default eQuest zoning 
to 50% unconditioned storage, saving the model for the second building 
and then only changing the "Conditioned" and "Unconditioned" setting in 
the Saved-As model under "Zone Conditions" in screen 2 of the wizard.

Does anyone know why this does not change the results?

Thank you,

Hello All,

  I am trying to run a .inp file that was created with eQUEST in DOE22.  I am getting a library error.  I see that there is a library for eQUEST 363 in the C:\doe22\exent but I do not know how to call it from the command line.  Can any of you help me by letting me know how to call the eQUEST library from the command line in DOE22 or running eQUEST itself from the command line?  Thank you so much.

Hello John,

Though eQUEST uses DOE2.2 engine, library is not the same.
eQUEST and DOE2.2 each has a little different library file for their own
usage.

You may find missing component of DOE2.2 library in error message.
You could copy that component from eQUEST library and past it to DOE2.2
library.

Hope this resolve your problem.

Thanks,

Donghyun Seo

also make sure you have not saved the project in eQUEST 3.64, because you
will not be able to run it with .63 anymore, and this may the source of the
errors.

Hello John,

 

Though eQUEST uses DOE2.2 engine, library is not the same. 

eQUEST and DOE2.2 each has a little different library file for their own
usage.

 

You may find missing component of DOE2.2 library in error message.

You could copy that component from eQUEST library and past it to DOE2.2
library.

 

Hope this resolve your problem.

 

Thanks,

Hello All,

 I am trying to run a .inp file that was created with eQUEST in DOE22.  I am
getting a library error.  I see that there is a library for eQUEST 363 in
the C:\doe22\exent but I do not know how to call it from the command line.
Can any of you help me by letting me know how to call the eQUEST library
from the command line in DOE22 or running eQUEST itself from the command
line?  Thank you so much.

Hello,

So the update I received was to copy/paste my equest library into my C:/doe22/exent/usrlib.dat which I did and I was still missing the material in question.  I went through and found that the materil "Conc HW 140 lb 4 in ..." was actually in the bdllib.dat.  I overwrote the doe22 bldllib.dat with equest bdllib.dat but I still get the same problem.  It appears as though doe22 is not looking in the bdllib.dat because when I copy/paste the material in question to usrlib.dat it does not return an error for that material.  Should I just copy/paste all the materials i'm using in the bdllib.dat to usrlib.dat?  It seems a little  time consuming to do it that way.  Is there a better way?  A way to just run eQUEST from the command line?  Thanks for your help.

John Grando
