Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Underfloor heating (electric/hot water)
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F199910311113.AA132485MD86320@gard.com>



I am interested in simulation of heating systems and particularly in
underfloor heating
systems.
Do you think that hydronic is better than electric undefloor heating?
 I suppose that the problem with the latter can be the lack of an
appropriate control
or do you consider that the problem is the heat source itself?
My interests will be focused on the heat storage (at off-peak hours) and
heat release and distribution in heavy weight construction making use of
underfloor (electric if possible) heat. Would you give any chance to ceiling
heating considering the low height of rooms in dwellings? And do you know
any system (hot water/electric) to be placed withing walls?
Please, if you know where I can find more info (books, brochures, companies,
web sites,...) about this or other related issues, let me know.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Modeling an Enclosed Shopping Mall
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F199910291114.AA141000MD85900@gard.com>

Hi all

I haven't seen any action from this list for awhile, but I think I have a
good one.

Does anyone have experience simulating an enclosed shopping mall in DOE-2?
If so, I'd be interested in knowing what kind of an approach you used.  Both
a package unit based and central-system type HVAC systems would be
considered.  I'm especially interested in how (or if) you handled the tenant
space/common area interactions, and any other special concerns to be aware
of for these unique building types.

Any thoughts would be appreciated.  Thanks!

There are a number of models ranging in complexity for calculating beam
from total. The book Solar Engineering of Thermal Processes (Duffie and
Beckman 1991) lays out all the various models in quite a bit of detail.

ASHRAE's "Annotated Guide to Load Calculation Models and

It doesn't include the algorithms but it does have a large 
number of references to papers containing algorithms.

Hello!

I have hourly data on total horizontal radiation for Kathmandu, Nepal. I
need to derive direct beam radiation and diffused radiation. I also do
have hourly data on total sunshine hours and cloud cover.

Does anybody have the algorithm handy to calculate direct beam and
diffused components? I would really appreciate your help.

Recently four new requests-for-proposal (RFPs) were placed on the ASHRAE
Home Page  (www.ashrae.org).  You may view, print and download any of these
by clicking on "Research" and then "Research Projects Ready To Bid".  You
may also obtain the necessary forms and additional information needed to
submit a bid from the same site.

We expect additional projects will be posted in November, but please be
advised that, due to funding limitations, there will be fewer than usual
RFPs posted this year.

Please share this announcement with any of your colleagues who may have an
interest in these projects, or who may wish to be added to this announcement
list.

Thank you,

                DOE-2, BLAST and ENERGY-10 User Survey 

The U.S. Department of Energy is supporting development of EnergyPlus,
a new-generation building energy simulation program that combines the best
features of DOE-2 and BLAST and adds other calculation capabilities.
EnergyPlus is being developed by the University of Illinois, Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory, the U.S. Army Construction Engineering
Research Laboratory, Oklahoma State University and others.  EnergyPlus
version 1.0 will be available in January 2001.

If you are a user of DOE-2, BLAST or ENERGY-10 we'd like your advice on
what features not already in these programs you would like to see in
future versions of EnergyPlus. (EnergyPlus will be of interest to
ENERGY-10 users since it is planned to replace ENERGY-10's calculation
engine with EnergyPlus).

We'd also like to know how you're currently using DOE-2, BLAST or ENERGY-10.
The information you provide will help in our planning and program-design
efforts to assure that the EnergyPlus engine meets your simulation needs.

So please take a few minutes to fill out the following questionnaire.  We
would appreciate your response even if you participated in a similar (DOE-2)
survey done in 1995.  Please mail, fax or e-mail your completed
questionnaire by December 15, 1999 to:

Kathy Ellington
Simulation Research Group
MS 90-3147
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
Berkeley CA 94720

Fax: 510-486-4089
E-mail: kathy at srge.lbl.gov

For your convenience, a PDF version of this questionnaire is available
on the Web at http://gundog.lbl.gov under "EnergyPlus > User Survey"
