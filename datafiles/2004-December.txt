Hello group,

I am so glad to have found out about this forum!  I hope some of you
will be able to answer my questions.

How does the HVAC system fan (and schedule) work?  Does this unit
control the building air flows/ventilation rates?  I wasn't able to
turn off or reduce space heating during the summer months.  Is there a
place to resolve this?

The infiltration rates appear to be controlled by two inputs -- air
change (per hour?) and cfm/ft^2.  However, when one value is
specified, it seems as though the program shoudl be calculating the
other, just because it has the information such as building volume and
square footage to do so.  The end reports yield different values when
one or the other or both are entered, even though they should be
dependent on each other.  Is there a way to input the building
infiltration to ensure accurate end calculations?

In the Schematic Wizard, I am allowed to specify values for both
nonresidential and residential domestic water heating in two different
windows.  Do these specifications result from the same heating unit? 
For example, I am able to input two different tank capacities, but am
uncertain whether this means I have two tanks or one.

Thank you so much.  Your help is greatly appreciated.
Christine

Paul,

Yes, the BLDG-SIM mailing does support digests but the 
feature is not used much.  Send a message to 

  mdaemon at gard.com

That contains the line:

  DIGEST BLDG-SIM

To turn off digests and get messages one at a time send to 
the same email address:

  NORMAL BLDG-SIM

The digests are processed at 3 am.  The address you send 
the email from must be the same as what is used by the mail 
server to send email to you.  If this doesn't work, let me 
know and I can do it manually.

Also, if you do use DIGEST and want to reply to a message 
that was in a digest back to BLDG-SIM please made change 
the subject line to reflect the specific message subject.

Thanks,

Jason

eQUEST(ion)The easiest way to do an adiabatic exterior wall is not to do it
at all.  Though it at first seems counter intuitive, eQUEST/DOE-2.2 will not
have any heat transfer except across a surface that is defined.  Unless you
need interior reflectance for daylighting or wall weight for heat transfer
coefficients, just delete the wall.

  Samuel,
  I think you can set the material of the wall to have a very high R-value.
I'm not sure you can make it completely adiabatic though. One possibility
(though I have not examined it too closely, could be to model it as an
interior wall, and reference the parent space os being adjacent to it. I
have not tried this method yet, and dont know if it will give you errors.

    Dear Bldg-sim users,
    1. Is it possible to model adiabatic exterior walls? If not, can we turn
exterior walls into interior walls, and then to adiabatic walls?. I`m always
talking about eQUEST. The fact is that I need some exterior walls not to
have heat conduction and I can't come up with a solution that works.

    2. I'm new in building simulation, and I'm beguining to understand how
hard is to develop this kind of programs. With all the public institutions
support (and funding), at least in Europe, can we expect a further and
faster development in next few years? What is the situation in the U.S.A.?
In my opinion the demand of this simulation programs and its developers it's
unstoppable.

(my last response included a graphic which caused the message to display 
as blank in my e-mail client - so here it is minus the picture) -

(1)  There is an undocumented feature of the wizard footprint screens 
that enable the user to flag perimeter walls as partially or entirely 
adiabatic.  Simply click (with the RIGHT mouse button) on the perimeter 
wall you wish to transform and a menu will be presented enabling you to 
choose either Entirely or Partially Adiabatic Wall.

Also FYI - if you use the Design Development Wizard to create a 
building/site description w/ multiple shells that are side-by-side, the 
surfaces of each shell that abutt each other are automatically created 
as adiabatic walls.

There is no way to convert an exterior wall to an interior, adiabatic 
wall within the detailed interface.  For those familiar with BDL input 
files, you can edit the "<project file>.INP" file to accomplish this 
switch, otherwise, you must delete the exterior wall and create an 
interior wall in its place (perhaps create the interior wall first to 
maintain access to certain keyword values that you might want to copy 
from the exterior to the interior walls).

Hope this helps.

Subject: [bldg-sim] My two cents on DOE-2 adjacent surfaces..
In-Reply-To: <MDAEMON-F200412271239.AA3935203pd80000480068@gard.com>
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200412271420.AA2033218pd80000487412@gard.com>

Mohit,

Vikram is correct in that DOE-2 (2.1E OR 2.2/eQuest)
in that a surface should only be input ONCE. You say
the 2nd story floor and the 1st story ceiling have
some external exposures. Say that your total adjacent
ceiling/floor is 10,000 sq.ft (meters,doesn't matter).

Also say that the exposure of the 2nd story floor AND
the 1st story ceiling is EACH (for simplicity) 1,000
sq.ft.

You would then model all material for the adjacent
ceiling floor (8,000 sq.ft) ONCE in the 1st story
ceiling data, then model a 1,000 sq.ft exterior wall
for the exposed floor, with an outward normal of 180
Deg, which will point it straight down (BLDG-SIM, I
think I have this right).

Then put your 1,000 sq.ft roof in for the 1st story
exposed ceiling. If it is totally out of any sun, I
would point this surface at the same 180 Deg angle.
You will still get transmision load from the outside,
but NO solar load.

This should total 8,000 sq.ft of adjacent surface,
1,000 sq.ft of exposed 2nd story floor, and 1,000
sq.ft of exposed ceiling, but not exposed to the sun.

If I recall, DOE-2 doesn't care what you call an
external surface, what angle you put it on, or where
you locate it, as long as you attach it to a space.

Have I opened up a rat's nest?

Mohit,
You should model the surface only once. Typically, (in the eQUEST default models), its done with the roof (or ceiling) of the lower floor representing the surface. When you build the surface, you will be asked to define adjacencies  (what space is next to it) for itnernal surfaces. If you are modelling a surface that has an external exposure, you might need to break it  up into 2 surfaces though - one for the internal surfaces, and one for external surfaces. Also, if there is one room adjecent to 2 rooms, (say you have 2 spaces on the top floor, and one on the bottom), it would probably make more sense to model it as 2 floors or 2 ceilings, because you can define only one adjacency per internal surface.

hope that helps

Hi,
I have two spaces (with almost similar profiles) one on top of the

space has a "roof" (basically an internal floor for the most part but it
does get exposed at some places). How does eQUEST read the constructions

R-values where they do overlap?
Thank you,

Gary,
I'm not sure about the wave form you are talking about, but if it can be simplified into a pitch roof, the wizard in eQUEST models pitched roofs. If you need  to, you could even model a multi faceted curve in the detailed interface, but that might be getting more detailed than you need.

References: <MDAEMON-F200412211143.AA4300187pd80000475539@gard.com>

CALENER is in fact a Spanish & SI derivative of eQUEST.  Some of this 
work was done by the DOE-2.2/eQUEST development team, but most was done 
by a team of people at the University of Seville (Universidad de Sevilla).

In terms of the SI units, John is correct - the version of DOE-2.2 
bundled within eQUEST (& CALENER) can in fact handle SI units, but there 
are several SI-related issues related to eQUEST that have not yet been 
dealt with, which is why there is not yet an SI version of eQUEST available.

CALENER is designed to accept only SI inputs, contains no building 
creation wizards and utilizes a results review module developed in Spain 
(replacing the one in eQUEST).  I believe that a custom library of 
building components was developed for use with CALENER and is not simply 
a translation of the libraries that come with eQUEST.  The CALENER 
tabbed dialog interface (providing access to the DOE-2.2 BDL commands & 
keywords) have been both translated into Spanish and modified to hide 
many simulation keywords and collect certain new, non-simulation 
keywords that, through BDL expressions and/or their compliance ruleset, 
are referenced to populate the keywords used by the simulation engine.

Dear Samuel,

I have taken several eQuest classes in Southern
California, USA from Marlin Addison, a major developer
of eQuest(Marlin.Addison at doe2.com, I believe). He has
mentioned the CALENER program several times. I am lead
to believe it is an eQuest type of program. But
contact Marlin for developmental details.

I continue to be amazed as to how international DOE2
has gone.

By the way, DOE-2.1E could ALWAYS do Metric Units, and
I believe DOE-2.2 is the same. DOE-2.2 is the "engine"
for eQuest, you may already know.

Dear Bldg-sim users,

I'm using eQUEST to asses the energy efficiency in dwelllings, and I was
wondering if there was a version that used International System units.

On the other hand a spanish university has developped a building
simulator based on DOE called CALENER. Anyone has performed any building
simulation with CALENER? If so, what's your opinion? Is it good enough
to perform energy assesments?

Thanks

Dear Gary Zeng,

Usually you can simplify the wave into a few rectangles/trapezoids.  A few 
degrees difference in tilt will not affect your results to any significant 
degree.  What matters is (1) the tilt of the roof surface, and (2) the 
surface area of the roof; the first affects solar gain, the second heat 
transfer.  As long as your simplification matches these two criteria 
reasonably well, your results should be reasonable as well.

Sincerely,
Smita

Hello Vikram,

If you don't find a locally convenient source for the IECC 2003, here's
the headquarters address for the publisher (the ICC):

International Code Council, Headquarters
5203 Leesburg Pike, Suite 600
Falls Church, VA 22041
Ph: (703) 931-4533

Closer to you would be the Birmingham District Office at: 1-800-877-2224

To the question of stringency, there is no single answer, nor (in my
opinion) will there ever be.  DOE's PNNL has done some extensive
comparisons between the ASHRAE 90.1-1999 and IECC 2000/2001, and we at
Texas A&M's Energy Systems Lab (ESL) have done comparisons in intricate
detail of the differences in stringency, mostly as they impact climate
regions of Texas.  Also, I believe that all the Technical Committees
within ASHRAE have been asked to address this question of stringency.

What we've discovered is that the lighting power density limits are
similar, though the IECC has many NR (No Requirement) in spaces that
ASHRAE does have requirements, especially in the space-by-space method.
ASHRAE has values specified for 93 space types, while the IECC 2003 only
has 27 plus a category called "other".  In the whole building method
(still in lighting), ASHRAE has 32 building types while IECC has 25 plus
"other".  The IECC limits for lighting power densities have been reduced
from the 2001 version to the 2003 version, but ASHRAE has also reduced
the limits from the 1999 version to the 2001 version of Standard 90.1 by
approximately the same amount.  

In regard to envelope U-values, at first sight these appear to be fairly
compatible between ASHRAE and IECC; however, there are more
qualifications in ASHRAE -- like differentiating between semi-heated
spaces, residential vs. non-residential, etc. that you will not find in
the IECC. We found that the IECC is usually more stringent for above
roof insulation, while ASHRAE is more stringent for attic insulation.
ASHRAE has very relaxed stringency for semi-heated spaces.  The IECC
allows its roof U-Factor limits to vary as the window-wall-ratio varies
-- ASHRAE does not.  On fenestration SHGC limits the two standards are
similar, but ASHRAE has NR (no requirement) for semi-heated spaces.
Also, IECC SHGC limits vary with the overhang ratio -- ASHRAE does not.

Mechanical requirements seem the most compatible (though not exact
equals) between the two standards in regard to stringency.  There are
some differences in EER requirements for non-standard chillers.

Finally, as you are probably aware, both standards have a section called
"exceptions" following many of the sub-sections within the respective
standard.  Many of these exceptions are different between the two
standards, so reaching a concluding statement as to which is more
stringent, I believe is a near impossibility.

A&M's ESL issued its comparison of the above (focused on Texas climate
areas) in a report to the Texas Commission on Environment Quality (TCEQ)
in December 2004.  The code comparisons refer to specific portions of
(90.1-1999 vs. 2001), (90.1-1999 vs. IECC 2001), and (90.1-2001 vs. IECC
2003).  Soon, the 2004 report will be available at:
http://eslsb5.tamu.edu.  Dr. Jeff Haberl is responsible for the issuance
of the report and the content of the web site.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] eQuest modeling - Radiant Slab ---> Ground Source Heat Pump
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200412151701.AA0107812pd80000469911@gard.com>

Hi all,

I am modeling a radiant slab system, in eQuest V 3.52, which is
getting heat from a ground source heat pump (GSHP).

The problem is:
1. For a GSHP, Ground loop heat exchanger can be modeled only in a
water loop heat pump (WLHP).

But, 2. eQuest crashes as soon as I let the Radiant slab system draw
heat from the WLHP, instead it creates a default Hot Water Loop. And,
hot water loop does not support a ground loop heat exchanger.

So is there any way of working around this problem? Please respond if
anybody has a solution or has faced a similar problem.

Thanks much!!
Kajal Mehta

John,

I changed outside air control to fixed, thermometer type to reverse action, 
htrottling range to 4 and cool control to warmest.  My heating consumption 
went down.  I reduced reheat delta t,  but I still can meet the space 
cooling temperature (too low).

Any ideas?

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] CALL FOR INTEREST -- FORTH ANNUAL RADIANCE WORKSHOP
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200412150850.AA5017640pd80000468997@gard.com>

What: The use of RADIANCE in Design Practice, Research, and Education 

Where: McGill University, School of Architecture, Montreal, Canada 
 
When: August 11th & 12th (Thursday & Friday) 2005
 
The workshop will be hosted by the National Research Council Canada (NRC)
and McGill University, School of Architecture. Workshop organizers are
Christoph Reinhart (NRC) and Greg Ward (Anyhere Software).
 
Estimated Cost: previous workshop registration fees were about 200-300
Canadian Dollar (~0.82 $US) and we will aim for a comparable figure. 
 
Purpose: To provide design practitioners, researchers, and educators with an
opportunity to present their work with the Radiance lighting simulation
software, and to share ideas and solutions with other attendees.
Participants are invited to give a talk, which will be limited to 30 minutes
(~20 minute for the talk followed by ~10 minutes of open discussion). Please
note that a presentation at the workshop does not count as an official
publication, so it can be submitted in parallel to other venues without
conflict, and likewise may be work that has been published elsewhere. We
also plan to organize a software demo session during which developers can
present their working software. It is yet to be determined whether this
workshop will also include a tutorial component. 
 
Radiance users of all levels are welcome.
 
This is a preliminary call to gauge the level of interest and determine if
we will be able to hold this workshop or not. So, if you are interested,
PLEASE RESPOND NO LATER THAN FRIDAY JANUARY 7 2005 to Greg
(gregoryjward at gmail.com <mailto:gregoryjward at gmail.com> ) and Christoph
(christoph.reinhart at nrc.ca <mailto:christoph.reinhart at nrc.ca> ).
 
Please note, that this workshop has been scheduled in the week preceding the
9th International Building Performance Simulation Association Conference
which will also be held in Montreal ( <http://www.ibpsa.ca/bs2005/>
http://www.ibpsa.ca/bs2005/). We hope that some of you will be able to
combine the conference with the Radiance workshop. A final announcement with
the agenda, workshop dates and registration fees will be sent out in late
Winter 2005. Please complete the form below if you would like to attend.

Bet you aren't meeting space temperatures either.

Try increasing your airflow, and reducing your reheat
delta t. I believe if you also put your COOL-CONTROL
on WARMEST, that will free a few things up.

Something like that..

Dear BLDG-Sim colleagues,

I am using DOE2.1En133 to simulate Fan system with reheat boxes in space.  I 
am using the RHFS command in system, however, my heating consumption is very 
high and my space cooling temperature is very low.

Does anyone have experience with this issue and can offer any suggestions / 
fix for it?

Your assistance is greatly appreciated.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200412140943.AA4359968pd50000467128@gard.com>

Jason, your question is sort of loaded as it leans towards the standard
solution of adding variable speed control to everything that moves in
order to reduce energy, which will work but not in all cases. I would
like to see development in modeling hybrid systems; these would be
displacement ventilation together with a radiant system for either
heating or cooling or both. TC6.5 has been pushing this work statement
for more than a year now and there is still a reluctance to pick up on
the potential. Modeling a true displacement ventilation system in DOE-2
would also be advantageous. Another plus would be to look at operating a
space to comfort criteria in accordance with the new ASHRAE standard 55,
2004.

We have been trying to emulate the performance of radiant systems using
DOE-2 (through EnergyPro) for title 24 compliance, our results show that
radiant systems and hybrid systems are performing 30-40% below title 24
requirements even with the moving base case.

I know this reply is slightly 'off beat' to what you were actually
asking but you did ask and I would like to move forward rather keep
re-inventing the wheel.

I'm trying to pull together a comprehensive list of 

different energy conserving measures that can be considered 

for commercial buildings. I would like the measures to be 

"modelable" in a simulation program like DOE-2 or 

EnergyPlus. I am thinking broadly - more roof insulation to 

variable speed cooling tower fans. Someone probably has 

already put together a good list.  If anyone knows of such 

a list, please let me know.

 

Thanks

Jason,
The Hawaii Electric company has  a list of recommended ECMs on their website (I'm still looking for the link). Basically they provide rebates & incentives for each of the measures modelled, as well as pay for the energy  modelling.

I am modeling a large dormitory building.  I am specifically examining replacing its single pane curtain wall system with an insulated curtain wall system. ASHRAE-Fundamentals gives guidance on how to model the infiltration in residential buildings, but offers little guidance in terms of commercial buildings. Has anyone seen or done a study on infiltration rates on the exterior zones of commercial buildings? or a study on infiltration rates with different glazing types?
 
Any help would be appreciated.
 
Thank you,

Renee

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] New EnergyPlus V1.2.1 build available.
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200412101547.AA4758718pd80000461189@gard.com>

To Bldg-Sim subscribers

Good news and bad news....

Bad news--we found a few bugs in Version 1.2.1 that you might want to know 
about...

- COMIS results were not correct in the V1.2.1.012 release.  This has been 
corrected.

- DOE-2 Translator: The conversion in the DOE-2 Translator for Specific 
Heat is incorrect. The translated value is a factor of 1000 too small. The 
conversion should be J/Kg-K = 4186.8 * Btu/Lb-F. This has been corrected.

- In the eio output, the section "Zone Internal Gains/Equipment Information 
- Nominal" reports "Floor Area {m2}, # Occupants, Area per Occupant 
{m2/person}". The value being reported for "Area per Occupant" is the 
inverse {persons/m2}. This has been corrected.

- Several new error detections were added and other parts of the install 
cleaned up.

All addressed issues and known issues are available on the YahooGroups 
support list for EnergyPlus and will be downloaded if you download the new 
version.


Good news--a new build (22) of EnergyPlus Version 1.2.1 which fixes these
issues is now available from the EnergyPlus web site.

Steps to get the new build:

1. Go to the EnergyPlus web site ( www.energyplus.gov ) and click on
Getting EnergyPlus.

2. Complete the registration info (yes, you have to register again...).

3. Download the new version.  You may want to try the Windows web
install--it only will download the necessary new files, not everything.

Thanks for using EnergyPlus!

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200412101104.AA0418312pd80000460743@gard.com>

  You can change your hourly report output options in the eQUEST 
Non-Hourly Reports tabbed dialog. In the Project & Site window, open the 
Non-Hourly Reports tabbed dialog from the project tree. There is a tab 
for each report group - Loads, Systems, Plant, Economics. There are two 
controls in each tab that apply to hourly reports:
Report Frequency: You can select hourly, daily, monthly or Yearly
Hourly Data Save Format: Select "Formatted" to get hourly reports in a 
format suitable for use in other software tools such as excel or work. 
Hourly data output files are saved in the project directory with the 
file extension ".DAT".
Hope this helps.

Sim,

As far as I know the Plot and Binary choices for Hourly Report Output
are left over from DOE2.1e and do not do anything in DOE2.2.  Using the
Print option (eQuest default) hourly report data is output into the .SIM
file but also into the .LIN and .SIN files in a binary format.  *.LIN
files receive any hourly report variables associated with loads and you
guessed it *.SIN files receive any Systems variables.

You can convert the data in these files into a format usable in excel or
some other program.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Dedicated OA Systems
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200412061822.AA2206687pd80000454264@gard.com>

Mike,
In packages such as TAS, Apache, TRNSYS you shouldn't have a problem modelling this.  I am unsure how successful EnergyPlus is in representing dedicated OA systems with zone fan coils.

Over several years I have had thought hard about how to do various things in DOE-2.2 / EQuest to mimic dedicated OA systems.  There is no simple way to represent things.  You can use the OA-FROM-SYSTEM but this provides limited options on supply air temperature and humidity control due to the difficulties in not being able to link dedicated OA system control to the zone system requirements and the system passing return air (useful in atrium spill systems) instead of supply air.

I know Jeff and Steve are keen to see dedicated OA unit capability enhancements in DOE-2.2 and have been looking at some significant additions to the software.  It would be best to speak with them directly to understand where this is at.

I had sent our a note on this forum last year seeking any interest on co-funding some initiatives to enhance DOE-2.2's capabilities in this area including central reheat control for IU systems (used to mimimc chilled ceilings, beams etc), bypass control for simultaneous control of supply temperature and humidity.  Control of humidity off of supply dewpoint rather than return RH ...  

If people are interested please contact me (graham.carter at lendlease.com.au) as I have some funding, but not all that is needed.

Regards,
Graham Carter

Yes, read my papers. Typically a hybrid system consisting of a dedicated
ventilation system and a radiant system (either floor or ceiling for
heating and cooling) will be more than 30% below either ASHRAE 90.1 or
Title 24. We have successfully modeled these hybrid systems using Doe-2
VisulaDoe and Energy Pro. And anyone who knows anything about TC 6.5
knows that we are preparing a design tool for EnergyPlus (eventually).

Dear guys:
Now i am working on a simulation for a Fan coil unit system with a central

is that the owner ask me to evaluate the result of adding heatrecovery 
equipments at the primary air handler. But as i know, the primary air

system.How can anybody give me some suggestions about this problem. 

your help will be greatly appreciated.

Hopefully this is not straying too far away from simulation discussions,
but....

 

Is anyone familiar, or had any experience, with the USGBC's LEED Energy
and Atmosphere Measurement and Verification Credit?  I am aware that
there is much written out there about the IPMVP, but I was looking for
specific information from people who have done M&V work specifically to
achieve the LEED credit.  I am wondering if any US LEED projects have
actually obtained this credit besides the Chicago Center for Green
Technology and the Donald Bren School of Environmental Science &
Management.  I am going to give a presentation to the local USGBC
chapter on the credit and I wondered if any other Bldg-Sim listers have
experiences that I could refer to in my presentation.  Any information
on costs to meet the credit would be especially appreciated.
