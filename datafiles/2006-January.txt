Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200601061005.AA0555875pd80000926923@gard.com>

FYI...

The ESL's web tool was developed to be a code-compliant checking tool.
Hence, no thermal mass is simulated (other than the Pre-calculated
weighting factors), since thermal mass is not part of the 2000/2001 IECC
Chapter 4 analysis, which has a fixed thermal mass.

Second, for any IECC or 90.1 analysis, windows must be defined as a
U-value and SHGC, hence this simplified approach was used. This is an
issue I've raised with ICC and ASHRAE, namely that it is impossible to
simulate the IECC or 90.1 with any simulation tool that uses Windows 5
program, since this program cannot be run using Uvalue and SHGC...one
must have a real window.

You are right in saying that this introduces errors. However, if one is
simulating the IECC or 90.1 one must simulate the erroneous tables that
were produced with ASHRAE weighting factors and SC calcs...

We are developing an improved version that will have layered walls,
thermal mass, Windows 5 files, Winklemann's floor model, a duct model,
etc. 

We have several thesis on these problems as well.

This is nice try in terms of web based tool, although I don't
particularly like that the calculations are done as batch runs and
results sent via emails.  Also, windows are specified only through fixed
U-factor and SHGC, which is gross simplification and it introduces
relatively large errors.
Some of the other limitations like inability to specify weight of the
wall and roof construction, simple rectangular shapes only, etc. could
be relatively significant barriers for wider use.

Charlie

P.S.  In some instances, the tool gives an error after I select a
building and fill-in basic info.  I tried from couple of browsers, and I
get the same
behavior:

Subject: [bldg-sim] Water Loop Heat Pump with top-up boiler
In-Reply-To: <MDAEMON-F200601041430.AA3047156pd80001324816@gard.com>
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200601051000.AA0010656pd80000925181@gard.com>

Hello,
I have a situation in eQUEST were I am trying to set
up a Water loop heat pump loop with a ground loop heat
exchanger to handle the building base loads and a
top-up boiler which can handle peak loads in the
building.
I have two WLHP loops, one primary loop with the
ground heat exchanger and a secondary loop with a
booster pump with supplies condensing water to the
individual zone heat pumps. The Boiler is attached to
the secondary loop.
The simulation does run, but the boiler doesn???t kick
it. I verified this in the PS-H report.
The question I have is why isn't the boiler turning
on? Am I missing anything in the simulation or do I
have to set up any kind of equipment control to stage
the loop?
Thanks,
Gerald

Fifteenth Symposium on

Improving Building Systems in Hot and Humid Climates

 

Call for Papers

 

The Buena Vista Palace Hotel, Orlando, Florida

July 24-26, 2006

 

 

Abstract deadline January 16th

 

Hosted by

Energy Systems Laboratory and Florida Solar Energy Center

 

About the Abstracts

 

Technical papers are solicited for the 2006 Symposium on Improving
Building Systems in Hot and Humid Climates to be held July 24-26, 2006.
For the first time the Symposium will be held outside of Texas. ESL's
past relationship with the Florida Solar Energy Center provided an
opportunity to partner with a world class academic and research center
for energy studies. The conference site will be the Buena Vista Palace
Hotel (formerly the Wyndham Palace Resort) in Orlando, Florida.  This
unique and premier conference focuses principally on building air
conditioning performance in hot and humid climates. Attendees are upper
level energy managers, building managers, architects, designers,
consultants, utility representatives, code officials, equipment
manufacturers and suppliers, consumers and researchers from around the
world.

 

The purpose of the symposium is to accomplish technology transfer-from
the laboratories of leading academic institutions, research
organizations and industry; and from the best practices of practicing
design and operations professionals-to the building industry at large.
Identification of new equipment and processes is of major importance.
However, the paper and presentation should be free of commercialism.

 

Authors wishing to present a paper for consideration must submit a
200-400 word abstract of each proposed paper to the Program Coordinator
no later than Monday, January 16, 2006 (electronic format required). All
abstracts will be peer reviewed, and the acceptance based on content
quality, originality and composition.  A draft copy of an accepted paper
must be received by Monday, March 20, 2006.  The final corrected
manuscripts must be received by Monday, May 29, 2006.

 

Papers are usually allotted 20-25 minutes for presentation, followed by
a five-minute discussion.  The presenter of each paper receives a
reduced registration rate to the symposium, which includes a copy of the
proceedings and admission to all technical sessions.  

 

Instructions for Abstracts

 

1.   Abstracts should be 200 to 400 words in length.

2.   Include one or more keywords from the list of topics.

3.   Include title and all co-authors, address, phone number, fax number
and email address.

Include primary author's full name and company position.

Include short cover biography of primary author.

6.   Abstracts must be received by Monday, January 16, 2006 (electronic
format required).

You are right.  I simply replied to Jeff's message, and didn't notice that
his message was posted on a different thread.  Therefore, my observation was
for ESL web based energy simulation tool, not Green Building Studio.

This is nice try in terms of web based tool, although I don't
particularly like that the calculations are done as batch runs and
results sent via emails.  Also, windows are specified only through fixed
U-factor and SHGC, which is gross simplification and it introduces
relatively large errors.
Some of the other limitations like inability to specify weight of the
wall and roof construction, simple rectangular shapes only, etc. could
be relatively significant barriers for wider use.

Charlie

P.S.  In some instances, the tool gives an error after I select a
building and fill-in basic info.  I tried from couple of browsers, and I
get the same
behavior:


Server Error in '/GUI' Application.
Access to the path "d:\data\Inetpub\wwwroot\GUI\ASP_Err.log" is denied. 
Description: An unhandled exception occurred during the execution of the
current web request. Please review the stack trace for more information
about the error and where it originated in the code. 

Exception Details: System.UnauthorizedAccessException: Access to the
path "d:\data\Inetpub\wwwroot\GUI\ASP_Err.log" is denied. 

ASP.NET is not authorized to access the requested resource. Consider
granting access rights to the resource to the ASP.NET request identity.
ASP.NET has a base process identity (typically {MACHINE}\ASPNET on IIS 5
or Network Service on IIS 6) that is used if the application is not
impersonating. If the application is impersonating via <identity
impersonate="true"/>, the identity will be the anonymous user (typically
IUSR_MACHINENAME) or the authenticated request user. 

To grant ASP.NET write access to a file, right-click the file in
Explorer, choose "Properties" and select the Security tab. Click "Add"
to add the appropriate user or group. Highlight the ASP.NET account, and
check the boxes for the desired access.

FYI

The ESL has developed a web-based IECC and 90.1-compliant simulation for
Texas as part of our work for EPA to calc NOx emissions reductions. 

You can visit a beta version at "ecalc.tamu.edu". Documentation on the
iterations needed for an office building can be found in the 6 ICEBO
papers under the "reports" tab of "eslsb5.tamu.edu". 

I look forward to feedback from users.

There are some possible errors in DOE-2x that BDL does not catch.  Usually
you can find an error message at the end of the .SIM file.  In this case, it
will probably be after the LV-x and LS-x reports.  Hopefully, it will tell
you what you need to correct the problem.

  Dear all

  I have revised the input file of a project created before.BDL load file
progamme does no find any errors, but when performing simulation , the
program is ended at the stage of producing summary and verification reports
. " Run terminated by error(s) " is shown. So only load calculation is
performed. I never encounter such a program. And I cannot find error message
in BDL file. so I have no idea , what error cause termination of run(s).
does any of you have such a problem before, can you give me some
instruction. By the way , I am using Equest.

  Yours

Yatin,
   The Type460 documentation describes the syntax of the external parameter 
file that describes the geometry of the hypocaust. To change the geometry, 
you need to change the external parameter file. I will send you a second 
email containing the documentation file as well as a few other example 
geometry files that I have used in some of my projects.
Kind regards,
  david

Dear all

I have revised the input file of a project created before.BDL load file
progamme does no find any errors, but when performing simulation , the
program is ended at the stage of producing summary and verification reports
. " Run terminated by error(s) " is shown. So only load calculation is
performed. I never encounter such a program. And I cannot find error message
in BDL file. so I have no idea , what error cause termination of run(s).
does any of you have such a problem before, can you give me some
instruction. By the way , I am using Equest.

--
Yours
Nicole Chen

This is nice try in terms of web based tool, although I don't particularly
like that the calculations are done as batch runs and results sent via
emails.  Also, windows are specified only through fixed U-factor and SHGC,
which is gross simplification and it introduces relatively large errors.
Some of the other limitations like inability to specify weight of the wall
and roof construction, simple rectangular shapes only, etc. could be
relatively significant barriers for wider use.

P.S.  In some instances, the tool gives an error after I select a building
and fill-in basic info.  I tried from couple of browsers, and I get the same
behavior:


Server Error in '/GUI' Application.

Description: An unhandled exception occurred during the execution of the
current web request. Please review the stack trace for more information
about the error and where it originated in the code. 

Exception Details: System.UnauthorizedAccessException: Access to the path

ASP.NET is not authorized to access the requested resource. Consider
granting access rights to the resource to the ASP.NET request identity.
ASP.NET has a base process identity (typically {MACHINE}\ASPNET on IIS 5 or
Network Service on IIS 6) that is used if the application is not
impersonating. If the application is impersonating via <identity
impersonate="true"/>, the identity will be the anonymous user (typically
IUSR_MACHINENAME) or the authenticated request user. 

To grant ASP.NET write access to a file, right-click the file in Explorer,
choose "Properties" and select the Security tab. Click "Add" to add the
appropriate user or group. Highlight the ASP.NET account, and check the
boxes for the desired access.

FYI

The ESL has developed a web-based IECC and 90.1-compliant simulation for
Texas as part of our work for EPA to calc NOx emissions reductions. 

You can visit a beta version at "ecalc.tamu.edu". Documentation on the
iterations needed for an office building can be found in the 6 ICEBO papers
under the "reports" tab of "eslsb5.tamu.edu". 

I look forward to feedback from users.

Carol,

You should be more concerned about the ability of eQuest to incorporate a
"code ruleset" that automatically generates the necessary sizing runs and
baseline models with no user intervention.  Folks in Texas are trying to do
the same thing with DOE2.1e.

My point is as energy professionals we need to embrace these new
technologies and figure out how to incorporate them into our daily work
flow.  As others have mentioned simulation is rarely used by architects to
look at energy use, partly because of the time it takes to create a useful
model.  As Mike Roberts points out, the "drudgery" is finally being removed
from modeling.  

Using newer tools allows me to create more and more complex models with
considerably more zones (double or triple the number).  The more detailed
the model, the better the results, the more I am able to help designers
understand the energy implications of their design, not just at peak loads
but during shoulder and off-peak periods as well.  It's great showing an
architect/engineer that the peak cooling load in a space occurs on September
30 and not in July.  This information impacts their final design decisions. 

We need to embrace the fact that we have a unique skill set that design
teams need.  It's great getting paid for building a DOE2.1e model but it's
even better getting paid to help interpret the results of an energy
model so that you can effect the design of a building.       

Happy Holidays and three cheers for defeating drilling in ANWR once again.

Subject: [bldg-sim] TC4.7 Symposium - Long Beach, June 2007
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200601311502.AA020393pd80000966331@gard.com>

In its meeting in Chicago, TC4.7 approved in its program plan for the
'Annual Meeting of 2007 - Long Beach' organizing a symposium titled:
"Genetic Algorithms for Building Energy Calculations"

At the time being, as a Symposium Chair, I would like to hear from all
who are interested in submitting a paper for this symposium
(presentation at the meeting, and publication in the ASHRAE
Transactions).  If you are interested please send me an email, with an
attached abstract of your paper.

FYI, the symposium will be 1.5 hours long and will accommodate a maximum
of 3 speakers.  If we end up having more than 3 papers reviewed/accepted
we will then split the symposium in 2 parts, back to back (3 hours).

At a later date, I will contact you and ask you to submit your paper for
review (through the ASHRAE Manuscript Central system).

Regards.

Hello:

I'm trying a Packaged VAV system with exhaust recovery, and 
surprisingly, when I add a recuperator, cooling consumption increases, 
instead of reducing!! Can anybody explain this to me?????

Thank you.

Hello:

My name is Cristina, I'm an e-quest user, and I'm trying to simulate a  
VAV system.  The  cooling  loop is not a problem, but our hot water loop 
doesn't work. I send you the warning messages to help you see the 
possible error. If you could help me, It'd be great.

Concerning the thermal zones:

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200601301159.AA5931640pd50000964465@gard.com>


Please excuse the cross-postings...

Reminder!!!  Tomorrow (January 31) is your last chance for submitting abstracts for SimBuild 2006.  Abstracts may be submitted via our website at www.ibpsa.us  Please note that January 31, 2006 is a firm deadline for all abstracts.  See below for more information about SimBuild 2006 including other key deadlines.  




SimBuild 2006

IBPSA-USA will hold its second national conference, August 2-4, 2006 on the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  The format will be similar to the successful SimBuild 2004 held at the University of Colorado, Boulder.  Technical sessions over two days will feature presentations on a wide range of topics related to the simulation of HVAC equipment, airflow in buildings, energy usage, and the visual and acoustic environment in buildings, as well as demonstrations of simulation software and of hardware and software needed to emulate or measure the performance of buildings.   Friday will be a practitioner day, offering case studies, hands-on software demonstrations and other presentations aimed at giving practicing architects and engineers the information they need to be more informed collaborators with simulation experts.  The practitioner day will be coordinated with local US Green Building Council chapters and affiliates.  Training workshops by various software vendors are being scheduled for the Monday and Tuesday preceding the conference - further details will be announced later. 

The conference registration fees are as follows:

Three-day registration (full conference)        $380
Student registration                            $180
One-day registration for practitioner day       $180 

Conference housing will be offered on campus in dormitories and in nearby hotels.  Single- and double-occupancy dormitory rooms will range in price from about $65 to $110 per night.

The meeting is open to all, world-wide.  Boston is a convenient destination for travelers from major cities in the U.S. and in many other countries.  It is a historic and compact city, easily explored on foot and via public transportation.  Conference participants may want to stay longer and explore New England's mountains and Atlantic coast, from Maine to Connecticut.  MIT has a growing number of architecturally significant buildings that participants can visit, including recent work by Frank Gehry, Steven Holl, and Kevin Roche, and earlier projects by I.M. Pei, Eero Saarinen, and Finnish master Alvar Aalto.   Harvard University and Harvard Square are a short distance away.

Abstracts will be due by January 31, 2006, on topics concerning component- or system-level simulation at any time in a building's life: design, commissioning, and operation.  Papers may focus on development or application of simulation algorithms and software and case studies are particularly welcome.  More information and instructions for submitting abstracts will be posted soon on the IBPSA-USA web site (www.ibpsa.us).

Key dates:

January 31      abstracts due (firm deadline)
February 15     abstract acceptance
March 31        papers due
April 30        paper reviews provided to authors 
May 31  revised papers due
June 15 final decisions on all papers
August 2-4      SimBuild 2006 conference

Subject: [bldg-sim] App G 2004 question (self-shading)
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200601261255.AA5519750pd80000959787@gard.com>


Thanks everyone for sharing info on the App G question. I had forgotten
about the turn self-shading off feature!

so in essence the app G is advocating a block building in northern
climates and more self-shading massing designs for hot/warm climates -
or have I oversimplified the intention?

One question that comes to mind - is App G less stringent than the ECB
method thus allowing for more LEED points (at least the building part
sounds like it is closer to the 1989 standard - which i believe was less
stringent than the 1999 standard). But the lighting allowances are
tighter so the majority of points that came from lighting savings would
no longer be available. Havn't really looked at the HVAC section.

Subject: [bldg-sim] App G 2004 question (self-shading)


I'll throw out one take on this subject.  Disclaimer, I'm not on any
90.1 related committee and cannot give you an interpretation, official
or unofficial.  (Nor did I stay at a Holiday Inn Express (tm) last
night!)

Your modeling program may be able to turn self-shading on and off.  You
would still use your actual geometry, and all exterior surfaces that
would otherwise be in the sunlight would be subject to solar radiation
even if in reality they were blocked by another wing of your building.

Two ways to look at it:

1)  This item can give you a benefit for having a proposed building that
does shade itself.  If you can't turn self-shading off in your baseline,
and you can't rearrange the geometry so that it is thermally equivalent
but without the self-shading, then you won't fully realize your
potential savings.  I don't think your model would be "rejected" if it
turns out that you can't meet this requirement.  The intention seems to
be to help you find savings.

2)  Since you are now modeling the baseline in four orientations, it
won't penalize you when the baseline shades itself but your proposed
building doesn't.  Again, depending on your building you might be
penalizing yourself slightly, probably your model will be accepted even
if you can't implement.

You'd have to contact your AHJ I guess to get a variance on that
requirement, and/or someone on the ASHRAE committee or your USGBC
contact.  Or use different software.

My take on this topic assumes that there is more benefit for being
shaded at your location, maybe in some places it should be the opposite.

The document ?Evaluating Rooftop and Vertical Gardens as an Adaptation
Strategy for Urban Areas" by Brad Bass; Bas Baskaran of the National
Research Council's Institute for Research in Construction includes
some simulation verification of green roof  energy performance.  It is
available at http://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/fulltext/nrcc46737/.   It uses
VisualDOE rather than eQUEST but might be helpful.  There are a number
of other documents available at the IRC website on green roofs (mostly
by the same authors).

I would expect that you would want to include external shading with an
annual schedule in your simulation of the green roof.

With respect to the earth berming -- would this not be similar to an
underground wall (depending on the berm thickness)? Underground walls
can be modeled in DOE-2.

Where do you live, Scott?

Southern California Edison has an eQUEST rudimentary
course this Friday at their Customer Technology Center
in Irwindale, CA. Plus an intermediate seminar in
March. Go to www.sce.com, and look under CTAC.

Hi Scott:

I am confused when you say "just account for the
energy in the building, not the central plant".

I believe SS-D sums the actual energy consumed before
the plant. Certainly the electric usage.

How do you account for heating and cooling if you
don't have a chiller or boiler energy accounted for?

Also, PS-E subdivides all energy, central plant and
building for you.

Subject: [bldg-sim] Chiller Efficiency
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200601241527.AA2758906pd80000955977@gard.com>

I am doing an eQuest analysis of a building. I am trying to calculate
the energy usage of the building. I have an air handler with chilled
water coils. 

Now, when I am in DD wizard I have to specify the CHW Plant Equipment. I
know the type of Chillers, Condensers, and Compressors in the Central
Campus Plant and have sized the system characteristics for my building's
load and the equipment I selected. 

Since I am testing the energy usage of My building, I do not account for
the energy usage of the existing plant and any extra energy it uses to
provide for my building. I also am not charged for Chilled water.

I have seen people mention using meters when a Central Plant is
involved. When defining a meter, my understanding of the billing units,
equipment capacity(I assume this is the Mbtu/h of my building),source to
site efficiency, and heat exchanger characteristics are limited.

More simply, can't I just say that the efficiency is 0 kw/ton. (My logic
is that my building is consuming no energy due to the chiller to handle
each ton of cooling.) 

I don't want the cost of utilities I receive from my plant to factor
into the total energy cost of my building.

Any thoughts,corrections, or suggestions?

Thanks for the help,

Scott Runyon

Does DOE2 make any alterations to equipment performance (besides airflow) as
a function of altitude?  Or, should user entered efficiencies be at the
correct altitude?

Alpana,
Presumably you are looking at the Turbocor centrifugal compressors.  They are a variable speed centrifugal machine with superior low load efficiencies particularly at depressed condenser water temperatures.  While we have had difficulty getting enough data to fit the three chiller curves, I believe the VFD Centrifugal model in Equest / DOE-2.2 will represent the machines as well as can be expected.

Graham

Modeling the building in the specified orientations and averaging 
gives an orientation-neutral baseline.

Appendix G has been developed with substantial input from experts at 
PNNL and after discussions with USGBC.  Glad to hear that modelers 
are ignoring whatever they don't understand or find inconvenient.

Peter,

I believe the intent is to give you a way to get some savings from
orienting your building with an eye toward savings. If you pay attention
to the sun in your design (passive solar and/or daylighting), you should
get some savings relative to the average of the rotated orientations.
Similarly, you could get a penalty if you have too much west-facing
glass.

I'm not sure how strictly this provision is being enforced. Most of the
modelers I have spoken to ignore it, but that is a very unscientific
sample.
These modelers may not be submitting to USGBC.

For a utility incentive program, it often does not make sense to do this
rotation. Those incentive programs typically care about the savings from
incremental changes to the design, particularly those changes that carry
an incremental cost. I'm not sure how one would determine an incremental
cost for your building's orientation, so it is not a factor that would
typically be eligible.

I have a question about the Appendix G in 90.1, 2004.
In Table G3.1 the baseline building is to be simulated as follows:
" Orientation. The baseline building performance shall be generated by
simulating the building with its actual orientation and again after
rotating the entire building 90, 180, 270 degrees, then averaging the
results. The building shall be modeled so that it does not shade
itself."
What does --- the building shall be modeled so that it does not shade
itself ---- mean?
Does it mean that if there is, for example, an L shaped building (which
self shades), it has to be modeled as square? rectangle?
Any thoughts on this appreciated.

Vikram,
 
If your base system already is dehumidifying enough to bring the space
down to 50% RH under normal operation then you would not expect to see
any additional energy requirement. Depending on your OA fraction in
Atlanta you may not need any additional dehumidification than what you
get with your base DX system. Have you checked the RH reports from your
base model to determine if the base design is floating up over 50% RH?

I am trying to model a humidistat in eQUEST using a packaged single zone
system (for a project in Atlanta), and for some reason, it doesn't seem
to be adding energy for reducing max humidity from 100% to 50%. The
result is that there is a cooling penalty for using a liquid desiccant
dehumidifier. My question is:

A) Is it possible to have humidity controls for a PSZ system type? If so
- how do I do it? 
B) If not - what system type should I use, and how do I get it to
dehumidify? 

Thanks in advance.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200601231623.AA2337859pd80000953426@gard.com>

I'll throw out one take on this subject.  Disclaimer, I'm not on any
90.1 related committee and cannot give you an interpretation, official
or unofficial.  (Nor did I stay at a Holiday Inn Express (tm) last
night!)

Your modeling program may be able to turn self-shading on and off.  You
would still use your actual geometry, and all exterior surfaces that
would otherwise be in the sunlight would be subject to solar radiation
even if in reality they were blocked by another wing of your building.

Two ways to look at it:

1)  This item can give you a benefit for having a proposed building that
does shade itself.  If you can't turn self-shading off in your baseline,
and you can't rearrange the geometry so that it is thermally equivalent
but without the self-shading, then you won't fully realize your
potential savings.  I don't think your model would be "rejected" if it
turns out that you can't meet this requirement.  The intention seems to
be to help you find savings.

2)  Since you are now modeling the baseline in four orientations, it
won't penalize you when the baseline shades itself but your proposed
building doesn't.  Again, depending on your building you might be
penalizing yourself slightly, probably your model will be accepted even
if you can't implement.

You'd have to contact your AHJ I guess to get a variance on that
requirement, and/or someone on the ASHRAE committee or your USGBC
contact.  Or use different software.

My take on this topic assumes that there is more benefit for being
shaded at your location, maybe in some places it should be the opposite.

    There seems to be some confusion on the format of the IWEC files that were developed by ASHRAE about 5 years ago, and available through the ASHRAE Bookstore. Those files are in a text format that's 99% identical to the format used by NREL for their TMY2 weather files.  EPW is the weather file format used by EnergyPlus, akin to the *.BIN binary format used by DOE-2.  What you are doing is taking the EPW version of a WEC weather file, probably from DOE's EnergyPlus Web site, reconverting it to TMY2, and then packing it for DOE-2 using the doewth weather processor program (?).  You should be aware that DOE-2 weather files contain weather parameters in integer IP units, and so loses some precison compared to the original IWEC weather source file.

      Yes, I have done this in the recent past. I converted the .epw file for Ecuador into tmy2 file and then used the weather utility from DOE2 to convert to .bin format. It worked ok.

      If you want I could provide you with the .bin file for quito, Ecuador.

bulk airflow analysis matched the actual building temperature
measurements pretty closely when modeled against similar climatic

We have not tried to use it for energy simulation yet, though.  I'd be
really interested in hearing if anyone has done that and how it went.

A tool to use for natural and mixed-mode ventilation studies that I have found
useful is the nodal model integrated with CFD available within ESP-r. The
algorithm allows nodal analysis of the whole building and CFD analysis of a
specific part of it so that both CFD and nodal model converge to the same solution.

How well does COMIS work for natural ventilation?  My understanding is
that it's a nodal model and doesn't take the detailed room geometry into

I noticed that the latest release of EnergyPlus weather tool cannot
convert epw file to TMY2 any more. Not sure why the feature is removed!

There seems to be some confusion on the format of the IWEC files that
were developed by ASHRAE about 5 years ago, and available through the
ASHRAE Bookstore. Those files are in a text format that's 99% identical
to the format used by NREL for their TMY2 weather files.  EPW is the
weather file format used by EnergyPlus, akin to the *.BIN binary format
used by DOE-2.  What you are doing is taking the EPW version of a WEC
weather file, probably from DOE's EnergyPlus Web site, reconverting it
to TMY2, and then packing it for DOE-2 using the doewth weather
processor program (?).  You should be aware that DOE-2 weather files
contain weather parameters in integer IP units, and so loses some
precison compared to the original IWEC weather source file.

Hi

Yes, I have done this in the recent past. I converted the .epw file for
Ecuador into tmy2 file and then used the weather utility from DOE2 to
convert to .bin format. It worked ok.

If you want I could provide you with the .bin file for quito, Ecuador.

Dear Energy Modelers:

Has anyone successfully applied IWEC weather data for DOE 2.2 or eQuest
energy simulations?

I am starting a project in Ecuador and I'm considering obtaining IWEC
data for use with the DOE2 weather utility to convert over to .bin
format.

Any observations or pointers in doing this would be appreciated.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200601201550.AA5008250pd80000949058@gard.com>

Brent,
 
Our firm is very excited about the capabilities of EnergyPlus and look forward to its wide use on design projects, but we really have to justify when to use it for the questions we are trying to answer. 
 
Our view is that EnergyPlus is a tool that should be used where any of the following exist:
 
1. Unique systems are in the design and can not be modeled in DOE-2 (radiant, UFAD, etc.)
2. Comfort analyses
3. Moisture analyses
4. Large building natural ventilation
 
So, if one uses EnergyPlus for the above scenarios their model should be more accurate then a DOE-2 model for the following reasons.
 
1. Radiant systems and UFAD are very sensitive to view factors and temperature differences and must be modeled at the room level rather than a zone level for accurate and meaningful results.
2. Comfort analyses are highly dependant on several things including view factors of surfaces and a simplified thermal zone analysis equates to meaningless surfaces that do not exist from the occupants view point. Consequently, the simulation results of a comfort analysis would be very questionable in a highly simplified model.
3. Any moisture analysis must include all interior surfaces, interior materials, and conditions that can absorb and give off great amounts of moisture and simplifying the model by eliminating surfaces produces a simulation whose results are very questionable.
4. Natural ventilation is very sensitive to the accurate representation of external walls as well as interior partitions. Again eliminating interior surfaces/openings and simplifying exterior surfaces will produce a simulation whose results are very questionable.
 
If it is a typical building with a typical system that can be modeled in DOE-2 and you are trying to answer annual energy use questions, DOE-2 is the ticket. If any of the above scenarios are desired, then a detailed EnergyPlus model is required. Not a simplified one.
 
I am curious to know how many zones, surfaces, and systems your 16.6 minute run had. Do you mind sharing?

Subject: [bldg-sim] EnergyPlus - DOE


Here is some more information on EnergyPlus simulation run times.  
 
I recently did a study with 5,374 EnergyPlus baseline models covering virtually every kind and size of commercial building out there (as reflected in 1999 CBECS public use data).  These are all full-blown, annual building models with 5-zone-per-floor thermal zoning, 15-minute timesteps, PSZ and VAV HVAC systems, etc, etc.  
 
Here is a summary of the run times I encountered:
 
Average:  4.53 minutes
Standard Deviation: 3.15 minutes
Minimum: 0.92 minutes
Maximum: 16.6 minutes
 
These were run on 3GHz, 64 bit AMD processors running Linux with a 64-bit-compile of Version 1.2.3.  
 
I have learned the hard way that it is entirely possible (and quite tempting) to create overly-complicated EnergyPlus models that will lead to excessive run times.  To speed things up, use Zone multipliers wherever practical and keep the number of windows and surfaces low.   I also set Minimum System Timestep to 5 minutes, and Maximum HVAC Iterations to 5.

	Brian,

	 

	I think one additional difference from uses' point of view, which is not reported in this report, is simulation run time. It seems EnergyPlus takes 5-10 times longer to complete a whole year simulations than DOE2. I was running a simple 5 story building with VAV system and it took me more than 40 minutes for annual hourly simulations (1 hr time step) in EnergyPlus while eQuest could run the same building in less than 5 minutes. I am interested in hearing from others on the run time issue.

	That is a big question.

	 

	For a comparison of current energy simulation software, you could look at Dru Crawley's paper comparing 20 tools:

	http://www.energytoolsdirectory.gov/pdfs/contrasting_the_capabilities_of_building_energy_performance_simulation_programs_v1.0.pdf

	 

	Main differences between DOE and EnergyPlus:  

	1)      DOE calculates the space loads for each hour then calculates the system and plant response for each hour.  EnergyPlus simultaneously solves the loads the system/plant response for each timestep.

	2)      DOE has a fixed 1 hour timestep, EnergyPlus has a variable timestep (down to 1 minute?).

	3)      There are also key issues with the weighting factor assumptions, the wall convective coefficients.

	 

	I haven't used EnergyPlus much yet.  What did I miss guys?

Kendra,
 
As others have suggested, you can use a unique shell in the design
development wizard and define custom zone shapes for each shell, but you
need to be careful as the current version of eQuest does not do vertical
clipping of horizontal surfaces to determine the horizontal surfaces
(floors and roofs) that are exposed to outside conditions and those that
are in contact with an adjacent space in the adjacent shell. This is a
significant concern if your floor plates are different shapes and
orientations.
 
I believe the eQuest development team is currently trying to correct
this issue.

Hello,
I am using eQuest and  am  not expert in HVAC systems.
I have a simple question (for the expert users):

When we talk about tonnage of a system - does it mean
we go to report SS-D and look for maximum cooling load
(KBTU/hr)and divide it by 12000 (which will give me
the system size in ton)? What about the maximum
heating load (KBTU/HR) in the same report? does it
play any role in system sizing?

I hope the question is understandable. My main aim is
to find out if changing lighting fixtures will
decrease/increase the system size.  It may decrease
the maximum cooling load but increase the maximum
heating load. How should I consider these both loads
calculated in SS-D report?

Thanks for your help..

Hi

Yes, I have done this in the recent past. I converted the .epw file for
Ecuador into tmy2 file and then used the weather utility from DOE2 to
convert to .bin format. It worked ok.

If you want I could provide you with the .bin file for quito, Ecuador.

Brent, my 2 cents.  If all you want is building-scale energy results, a
model employing simplified zoning (eg 5 zones per floor) is fine and you'll
get reasonable runtimes. If you want to use EnergyPlus for design (eg
10-20-30 unique zones per floor), expect much longer runtimes.  If you have
errors-warnings-cautions coming out of your model, 4 minutes can easily
become 4 hours. Mahabir, this sounds like what may have happened to you. E+
just doesn't stop after a sensible number of errors has been generated, and
there are several different types of problems in a model that can cause a
simulation to run on interminably.  It's only when you're model is reaching
completion that the runtimes improve.

Renato, have you looked through the gettingstarted.pdf and
engineeringdoc.pdf? These describe a lot of the differences.

3)      There are also key issues with the weighting factor assumptions, the wall convective coefficients.

 

I haven't used EnergyPlus much yet.  What did I miss guys?

Hello everybody.

 

I would like to know if anybody has experience on using both EnergyPlus and DOE.

Currently I'm using an interface for EnergyPlus. From the software description I couldn't find out the main differences between EnergyPlus and DOE. Does anyone know the main differences or where can I find them?

since I just now was figuring out the same thing myself, thought I would share it. Here is what I did:

use custom on all screens where needed. Each floor is a new shell. and on the next screen it asks for the placement of the shell - you can say immediately above/ below another shell.

Hope this helps

The way I have handled multi level zoning is to build
one floor at a time in the wizard and saving it as a
different file. Then I manually go to the inp file and
change all the names of the spaces and associated
polygons and zones by doing a simple search and
replace using textpad. Finally, I import the inp file
of the second floor in the detailed interface.
Hope this helps.

Is there any comparison between e+ and DOE 2 with regard to the accuracy of
the predicted loads and energy consumption? I'm curious about the benefits
(in terms of accuracy) obtained from simultaneously solving the building
loads and HVAC systems.

Mahabir,
The extended run time in EPlus could be due to transient analysis vs.
steady state in doe 2.

40 minutes for annual hourly simulations (1 hr time step) in EnergyPlus

That is a big question.





For a comparison of current energy simulation software, you could look at
Dru Crawley's paper comparing 20 tools:


http://www.energytoolsdirectory.gov/pdfs/contrasting_the_capabilities_of_building_energy_performance_simulation_programs_v1.0.pdf





Main differences between DOE and EnergyPlus:


      1)       DOE calculates the space loads for each hour then calculates
      the system and plant response for each hour.  EnergyPlus
      simultaneously solves the loads the system/plant response for each
      timestep.


      2)       DOE has a fixed 1 hour timestep, EnergyPlus has a variable
      timestep (down to 1 minute?).


      3)       There are also key issues with the weighting factor
      assumptions, the wall convective coefficients.

Energy Plus can calculate moisture and heat transfer at the same time and much more.

Just to clarify, DOE2 does NOT use steady state analysis. The main difference in run time is due the different simulation techniques used in these two programs. DOE2 uses sequential simulation technique while EnergyPlus uses simultaneous simulation technique for loads, systems and plants. In DOE2 building zones, air handling systems and central plant equipment are simulated sequentially with no feedback from one to the other while in EnergyPus all the elements are integrated with proper feed backs and are solved simultaneously.

Mahabir,
The extended run time in EPlus could be due to transient analysis vs. steady state in doe 2.

It seems EnergyPlus takes 5-10 times longer to complete a whole year simulations than DOE2. I was running a simple 5 story building with VAV system and it took me more than 40 minutes for annual hourly simulations (1 hr time step) in EnergyPlus while eQuest could run the same building in less than 5 minutes. I am interested in hearing from others on the run time issue.

That is a big question.

 

For a comparison of current energy simulation software, you could look at Dru Crawley's paper comparing 20 tools:

http://www.energytoolsdirectory.gov/pdfs/contrasting_the_capabilities_of_building_energy_performance_simulation_programs_v1.0.pdf

 

Main differences between DOE and EnergyPlus:  

1)       DOE calculates the space loads for each hour then calculates the system and plant response for each hour.  EnergyPlus simultaneously solves the loads the system/plant response for each timestep.

2)       DOE has a fixed 1 hour timestep, EnergyPlus has a variable timestep (down to 1 minute?).

3)       There are also key issues with the weighting factor assumptions, the wall convective coefficients.

 

I haven't used EnergyPlus much yet.  What did I miss guys?

Hello everybody.

 

I would like to know if anybody has experience on using both EnergyPlus and DOE.

Currently I'm using an interface for EnergyPlus. From the software description I couldn't find out the main differences between EnergyPlus and DOE. Does anyone know the main differences or where can I find them?

Brian,

 

I think one additional difference from uses? point of view, which is not
reported in this report, is simulation run time. It seems EnergyPlus takes
5-10 times longer to complete a whole year simulations than DOE2. I was
running a simple 5 story building with VAV system and it took me more than
40 minutes for annual hourly simulations (1 hr time step) in EnergyPlus
while eQuest could run the same building in less than 5 minutes. I am
interested in hearing from others on the run time issue.

The way I have handled multi level zoning is to build
one floor at a time in the wizard and saving it as a
different file. Then I manually go to the inp file and
change all the names of the spaces and associated
polygons and zones by doing a simple search and
replace using textpad. Finally, I import the inp file
of the second floor in the detailed interface.
Hope this helps.

In-Reply-To: <MDAEMON-F200601171243.AA4326406pd80001349139@gard.com>
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200601180357.AA5723921pd80000943350@gard.com>

If my understanding is correct, the design set point can be used. ASHARE 90.1 doesn't specify the number of suppy and indoor air setpoint. The reason why 90.1 specify the delta T is to specify the air volume the system distributes. In that sense, a cold air distribution system could be more energy-efficient than the ASHRAE budget building, and could contribute to earning additional LEED points. if you use a system that has a delta T less than 20F, the system can be less energy-efficient and may have a bit negative impact on your way to LEED points unless special consideration is taken into account.

		Varkie Thomas, former simulation expert at Skidmore, Owings, & Merrill
		"Using M-E Design Programs"

		Out of a typical large M-E project consisting of 50,000 HVAC labor-hours, about 100 hours is spent on Energy analysis.  Another 200 hours might be spent on Loads calculations over the course of the project.  This is about the total extent of HVAC engineering design using computer programs today.  The remaining 99.9% of computer use is for drafting, word processing and spreadsheets for organizing information. The same is true for electrical, lighting, plumbing and fire protection design.  

		
		The M-E design process is fragmented, equipment selection and scheduling is intermittent and the process consists of frequent revisions and continuous exchange of fragmented information between specialized architectural and engineering personnel. A-E design documents from schematic to construction are issued in 2-D whereas the new automated systems are in 3-D.  The present organizational structure and specialized staff and tasks are not set up to work with these new advanced systems. There has to be a change in the A-E design culture.

		
		This presentation will discuss some of these reasons for the lack of progress in automating the M-E design process.

OK so the grey matter isn't working today, so I need some help.

If I understand 90.1, 2004 correctly under 11.3 (g), the supply air to
room temperature difference is 20F. So assuming this is based on an
overhead VAV system supplying air at 55F then the space operating

If this assumption is true, then using a displacement system, supplying
air at 63F, the space operating condition would be 83F.

Nyserda and CEC use design temperature set points but I cannot seem to
find these in 90.1,2004.

comply with appendix G, but what temperature set points are used?

I don't know if this is a useful exercise...since Equest's engine - DOE-2 really works best with 5 zones per floor. Unless you're doing something completely different in each zone (I.e. Changing thermostat setpoints, or different sys types) I'm guessing it will have a marginal impact beyond 5 zones per floor. In fact, 2 zone will probably give good results for most buildings (inside,outside). Several papers in the ASHRAE lit have addressed this issue.

Kendra,
You can assign various zoning patterns from within the schematic design
wizard on the "Building Footprint" screen. On that screen, select the
"custom" option on the Zoning Pattern menu (top left corner of the
screen). There you can choose to start with one the predefined zoning
patterns (perimeter/core etc), or choose a blank slate and create your
own custom zoning layout. You can also use import a CAD image as a
background to help create the zones. 
Good luck,

Yes.
Under the Design Development wizard, from the "Project Navigator"
screen, you can create new building shells after you have setup and laid
out a single story shell .
When creating a new shell you have the option to copy one you have
already made.
This copy can then be located above the original building shell and
modified with a different zoning pattern.
Please feel free to contact me if you require more clarification.
As you mentioned, this can all be done from detailed edit mode but it is
more time consuming.

This is a follow up to the Evap Precondenser question I posted last week. We are also using a Coolerado 16 stage evap preconitioner fr this building. We also have a Dry-Cor liquid dessicant unit.
 
At the moment I am showing a penalty on heating when I run the coolerado evap cooler (indirect evap) coupled with the liquid dessicant. Is there any way to schedule the evap preconditioner?

Ian,

 

 

You raised a very good point. Here are some of the things that I would like to share and I would appreciate some input myself:

 

1.    You wrote:

 

[I'm concerned about insect screens affecting the buoyancy driven airflow for a double skin fa?ade.]

 

Dr. Karl Gertis (director of the Fraunhofer Institute of Building Physics in Stuttgart, Germany) provides a critical review of double-skin fa?ades in one of his article and cites some problems in the literature regarding research related to Glass Double Facade e.g. "window insect screens cannot be used with natural ventilation because the airflow is too weak to overcome the pressure loss over the air filter."

 

For more information about the article please go to the following link:

 

http://gaia.lbl.gov/hpbf/perfor_c.htm

 

 

2.    You wrote:

 

[I was wondering if anyone new of some papers that have covered the airflow properties of insect screens or can give me some information off hand.]

 

 

            Jun Tanimoto, Jun and Kimura, Ken-ichi (1997), Simulation study on an air flow window system with an integrated roll screen, Energy and Buildings             26(3): 317-325.

 

 

There are a few sources that also deal with the effect of insect screen on airflow but they are specific to wind driven natural ventilation. 

 

            Swami, M.V. and Chandra, S. (1988), Correlations for pressure distribution on buildings and calculation of natural ventilation airflow, ASHRAE Transactions, Vol. 94, Part 1, pp 243-266.

 

This paper provides a procedure for determining ventilation rates based on the Vickery algorithm (1983), however, assumption inherent in this procedure is that there is no stack effect.

  

            Givoni, B. (1981), Man, Climate and Architecture, New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold.

            

On pp 304 Section 15.8 Givoni discusses the effect of fly-screens on ventilation. He quotes van Straaten, the decrease in total airflow, caused by a 16 mesh, 30 gauge wire screen is about 60% and 50% when the wind speeds are respectively 1.5 and 2 mph and only about 25% when the wind speed is 10 mph.

Andersen, Karl T. (1995), Theoretical considerations on natural ventilation by thermal buoyancy, ASHRAE Trans. 1995, Vol.101, Part 2, Paper number SD-95-14-1, 1103-1117

In the section 'coefficients of interest' the author discusses velocity, contraction, discharge, and resistance coefficients and may provide insight into the effect of insect screen on airflow, however, the author does not directly relate it to the insect screen.

 

There is a gap in the computation of natural ventilation research especially in terms of discharge coefficients and pressure loss coefficients as Ansyley (1999) and Linden (1999) point out that the computation of natural ventilation lacks experimental data and borrows the discharge coefficient and flow resistance of openings derived from data traditionally used for fluid flow in pipes and resistance values traditionally used in computation of mine ventilation.

I am trying to model (in eQUEST) a building that is using rooftop air cooled condensers, but is using misted rainwater to cool the condensing units. I have 2 questions based on this:
*	Is it reasonable to model this using the evaporative precondenser option in eQUEST?
*	The condenser type option is grayed out in my model, meaning I cannot select it. How do I get it to turn on?

Hello all,
 
Does anyone know of any documentation outlining the errors that one would expect from substituting water instead of glycol mixtures in simulations of plant efficiency?
 
Kind regards

Hello all,
 
Does anyone know of any documentation outlining the errors that one would
expect from substituting water instead of glycol mixtures in simulations of
plant efficiency?
 
Kind regards

We have a few models that can handle misting in the the TESS Libraries for 
TRNSYS.  The models were originally written for inlet air cooling (turbines 
etc.) but work just as well for HVAC applications.

Dear All,
i am hope ful that the above things can be simulated using trnsys, please
help if any one has any idea how to go about it.
Thanks !
