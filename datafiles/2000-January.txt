I agree with Dan on the complexity of skin load calculations especially when
the internal gains are the driving
force in Heating and Cooling.  From a Electric Utility prospective,  a
powerful Hvac simulation is more important
than putting all that horsepower on the skin of the building.
Looking at our commercial customers, 80% of them are 200kw and under, so a
scaled down simulation
will do the job for most Energy Analysis or audits. We cannot spend
thousands of dollars performing
an energy audit on a "Mom and Pop"  grocery store. Since there is no profit
for an Engineer to
do these small jobs we do them,  with a trade off for good results vs time
spent on the job.
Our company performed 8,000 audits last year with a simple tool like
MicroAXCESS and
investigating the end result,  they were very reasonable -- not totally
accurate but good.

On large jobs we use better tools and also spent more time and effort.

This has been the most stimulating discussion so far in this group.  I
think it is long overdue, because the impasse over DOE 2.2 and Energyplus
threatens to keep improved simulation tools out of the hands of users for
some time to come.  This is particularly frustrating because of the promise
of Doe2.2, which still could benefit from numerous additional HVAC
alternatives.  The circulation loop method of building systems is very
attractive and offers flexibility not available on any other program.  I
submit that the addition of packaged water-cooled VAV/PIU systems, a
revised and expanded scheme for waterside economizer, the addition of
cooling coil run-around heat recovery, the addition of photovoltaic
systems, and other components would be of much greater immediate benefit
than the revamping of the loads calculation procedure promised for Energyplus.

I must admit that I am mystified by the appeal of the energy balance
approach to loads-calculation for annual energy analysis.  In order
accurately to calculate the differential radiation balance among interior
surfaces, one must input those surfaces explicitly.  This would include
breaking down larger surfaces into a number of smaller surfaces in order to
accommodate surface temperature variations across the surface or within the
adjacent air mass.  This would be particularly important for any insolated
surface, and it would become necessary to calculate exactly the surface
components in direct sunlight.  In order to accommodate any air temperature
stratification that might occur, it would be necessary to input several air
temperature nodes and specify the coupling between them and different
surfaces.   The more complex becomes the load calculation, the more
difficult simultaneous solution of systems and zone air temperature
becomes. Ultimately, the loads program becomes a computational fluid
dynamics simulation with conjugate heat transfer. One has to question
whether this degree of complexity is appropriate for an annual energy
analysis, especially for a 40 story high-rise office building, or a medical
research laboratory.  It seems more appropriate to a short time period
investigation of temperature distributions within a single space or group
of spaces, a very legitimate investigation that is currently handled very
well by programs such as ESP-R, but one which perhaps should not be the
primary focus for federal funding in this area.

First, take a deep breath ... 

The basic ideas Charles expresses are, in my view, on track.  But some of
the details are biased toward his interests.  For example, VisualDOE and eQUEST
have both benefited from substantial support from California utilities use of "Public
Goods Charge" (PGC) funds. Both have had very substantial investment by
their developing companies (Eley for VisualDOE and JJHirsch for eQUEST.)
eQUEST is freeware for users and can be licensed by anyone for further
development without per copy royalty.  VisualDOE, currently, is marketed
as a commercial product.  So, I do not understand; under the policy
proposed is it suggested that eQUEST should be sold for a fee and not licensed
for further development, or that VisualDOE should be treated the same a
eQUEST - freeware and source licensed to anyone, or that neither should
have been funded in the first place?

Policy can treat private funded projects differently from Government funded
projects but for the policy to work it must treat different Government funded
projects similarly and different private funded projects similarly.

Obviously the key here is that both VisualDOE and eQUEST would not exist without
the combination of public and private investment; the partnership that Charles' paper
describes.  In both cases, I believe, the public funding should "extract" some
public benefit - such as the basic product being freeware (or very cheap) for
end users and the source being available (cheap) for developers - but the
private funding should provide some advantage to the developer as a "reward"
for their private investment.  I think the "reward" is that the private developers
get a head start, they retain copyright (so have an advantage over open source
in being able to do private products based on the starting point), and they gain
the internal know-how/experience from the project.  Future such public-private
partnerships should allow the developers to continue to retain ownership
of the copyright, but require that the "starting point" which is developed using
the public funds be placed out as open source under a Mozilla-like license; the
developer could, however, continue on with their original source copy to develop
private version licensed in any way they see fit.

The California investor owned utilities (and EPRI), when deciding to support
QUEST development "extracted" the public benefit but other California utilities,
when deciding to support VisualDOE, Cool Tools, and other related projects,
did not "extract" much that is yet seen.  This later case should change.  A similar
problem exists with California Public Interest Energy Research (PIER)
funding; they are spending millions on software tools in this field, but have
not published the terms to be used in the licenses for the resultant software.

When the support for the software comes ENTIRELY from public funds - be it
DOE, CEC/PIER, etc. - the ENTIRE resulting work should be made open
source under the BSD-like license so that anyone can run with it in any way.
Such software should not use the Mozilla-like open source license, as that format
was intended for use when the posted source contains substantial private 
investment; the Mozilla format "rewards" the copyright holder by leveling the
playing field for all but him/her who decided to make their private work open.

For EnergyPlus, Energy10, DBA, Radiance, Superlite, Window-4, BLAST,
CalERDA-1 through DOE-2.1C, and all the many such fully publicly funded software,
the route to take is clear: BSD-like license so that anyone can run with it in
any way on a level playing field.  However, I also believe that we don't need full
packaged commercial products from 100% government funds using 100%
directed procurements (sole source contracting); full products, if needed, should
be bid out as open procurements with a requirement for real cost-sharing.
If no bidder is willing to put up private money (not just another pot of public funds)
it is doubtful the product is needed.  If a full product is needed, it is best developed
within the private sector by companies who will, in the end, need to market it and
support it and who probably also understand the customer needs better than the
US Government, National Labs, or other public funding sources.

That said, however, I am 100% in favor of Government funding of basic algorithm, 
model and technology development; as I have said before, many advancements
in this field would not exist without this funding.  EnergyPlus the LBNL/UI
commercial product - NO; EnergyPlus the BSD-like open source simulation
toolkit maintained by LBNL and UI (and hopefully others in the future) - YES.
Energy10 the NREL commercial product - NO; Energy10 the BSD-like open source 
toolkit copyrighted by winning bidder XYZ company (and the private by-product
being XYZE10+ enhanced $1000 version) - YES.  VisualDOE the commercial
product - NO; VisualDOE the Mozilla-like open source toolkit copyrighted
by winning bidder Eley Associates (and the private by-product being Eley
VisualDOE+ enhanced $1000 version) - YES.  eQUEST the commercial
product - NO; eQUEST the Mozilla-like open source simulation and interface toolkit
copyrighted by winning bidder JJHirsch Associates (and the private by-product
being JJH eQUESTpro enhanced $1000 version - well, we pass on that one for
now, but reserve the right to do it) - YES.  

DOE-2 is a good example - we used several million dollars of private money 
in addition to several hundred thousand of public money (DOE and CA PGC
funds) to do our part of DOE-2.1D, DOE-2.1E and DOE-2.2.  We could
not have done this if the DOE-2 portions supported by DOE had a royalty
attached or had licensing that restricted redistribution (like Mozilla or like
the proposed, even more restrictive licensing for EnergyPlus) since we
could not have demonstrated to our private funders how THEY would
benefit.  DOE "extracted" from us royalty free DOE-2.2 distribution to the
public; even though US Government contracting of software development to
small businesses requires no such license grant for the privately funded
portions, DOE felt this DOE-2.2 license grant was required to fulfill their
public interest responsibility (though they have chosen, so far, not to
use that license grant to distribute DOE-2.2 to the public.) This is also
why I raised the question: does the user/developer community believe
we should move to open source licensing for DOE-2?


The policy should not be to say that US public money should be spend on engines but
not interfaces; the policy should be - if the need exists, the priority is high enough,
and the private sector cannot do it well enough or fast enough alone, plus 
US public funds are available, then do it all ... but do it in a way that partners with,
enables, and enhances the competitiveness of US companies in the world market.

Back in October, I wrote down some ideas on how public funds ought to be invested in energy software. I shared the paper with a few friends, but have not "gone public" with it. Since a lot of the issues raised in the "hornet's nest" series are addressed in the paper, I feel now is an appropriate time to share my views with others. The central theme of the proposed policy is that public investments ought to be made in a way that encourage private sector software developers to invest their own funds. This will leverage scarce public funds. Too often public investments in energy software have had the opposite effect, causing private developers to scale back or even withdraw from the business. The paper offers guidelines, which I think would achieve this goal. At this point, the opinions in the policy paper are mine and mine alone.. I welcome your comments.

To address a few additional points raised in the "hornet's nest" series:

VisualDOE 2.6 has a rudimentary link with CADD programs that works OK, but is not perfect. The problem is that about 90% or more of CADD files are not object oriented. In reality they are little more than a collection of lines, arcs and circles. We can recognize a line in the file, but often do not know if it represents a edge of a wall, the centerline of a duct, or a joint in the concrete floor. Until more CADD programs become object oriented and carry around the properties that matter to modelers, there is not much point in making a link. 

The latest version of VisualDOE, Version 3.0, works with DOE-2.2. An announcement was made in the Summer 1999 issue of the User's News. However, the newsletter editors removed all reference to "DOE-2.2" before the article was published, so the only way to know that DOE-2.2 is supported is to make a connection with the new features that are discussed in the article. The "hornet's nest" has prevented us from officially releasing Version 3.0.

"Pictures are nice, but pretty pictures of airplanes doesn't get the airplanes built or off the ground."

I believe that the 3D and 2D rendering of the building geometry is essential in producing an accurate model of a complex building.  Do you think they built better airplanes without any renderings or visual models?  Think again.  Until Joe Huang's DrawBDL came out, even models produced by the national lab responsible for DOE2 development had some incorrect geometry. Misplaced a wall or window? .... impossible to tell just by looking at BDL code.

  I used the Meriwether ESAS hourly analysis program from 1977 through 1984
  and the DOE-2.1 A through E since 1984 to date. The problem with all the
  DOE-2 interfaces is that the user STILL has to understand DOE-2, what it's
  keywords are, and what is actually trying to be modeled. Real engineering
  and energy dynamics insite must accompany any model effort, to truly
  represent what the building is, and what it can become (ECMs).
   
  I have been exposed to PowerDOE but don't yet have time to learn the
  geometry games it requires up front. PowerDOE will be nice to show a client
  the building geometry reproduce from the model input, but I am not in the
  pictoral rendering game. Rather, I need to demonstrate to the client the
  results of PS-E, how they change per ECM, and the correct dynamics of the
  utitliy rates as each ECM changes. Pictures are nice, but pretty pictures of
  airplanes doesn't get the airplanes built or off the ground.
   
  Another mistake production DOE-2 using companies use is trying to use DOE-2
  as a DESIGN program, rathher than an ENERGY ANALYSIS program.  A TRACE or
  Carrier E-20 is still far better at assessing exact coil sizes and airflows.
  There is not enought SYSTEMS information coming out to make me feel
  comfortable in ever using it accurately for design.
   
  It really took me 5 - 6 years to REALLY learn what DOE-2 does and doesn't do
  (and I STILL forget). And now another program is to be placed upon us
  (EnergyPlus) that we will have to learn the idiosyncrasies of.
   
  And for the retrofit industry, I STILL gotta match the utitliy meters....

I really must take some exception to your dismissal of using DOE2 to calculate energy savings.  After all, what do you think people use DOE2, or any other energy simulation program, for?

We have done far more projects using DOE2 to estimate energy savings than I care to think about.  The answers produced by the analysis must be taken with some caveats, but in general, they are the best available estimate of savings reasonably attainable.  Part of what you are getting at, I believe, it the fact that people's behavior on an individual scale is unknowable and that generalized answers do not necessarily apply to specific cases.

In a commercial building this may manifest itself in the fact that part of a building is unexpectedly unoccupied, or that the facilities guy stuck a 2x4 in the outside air damper to get rid of "that stink in suite 302".  If you did not anticipate these factors, then of course the energy prediction will be less accurate.  On the other hand, if you could predict these factors, then DOE2 would have no problem accounting for them.  If you want to conduct an energy savings analysis for a specific building, an audit is really required.  If you enter an accurate description of the building and its operation, then DOE2 does an extremely good job of predicting its energy use.  And that is what DOE2 is intended to do.  It, of course, cannot predict deviant and unexpected behavior in the building operation on it's own ... the person modeling the building must do this.

If you apply savings analysis for a "typical" small office to a specific building operating under specific conditions, then yes, there is and should be significantly less confidence in the answer.  This is an issue for the analysis itself, and is not a limitation of the analysis tool.

In residential buildings, this phenomena is even more evident.  We have used DOE2.2 to predict the energy flows of residential homes throughout the U.S.. These houses were operated under test conditions, and actual energy flows were measured using co-heating and co-cooling techniques.  The test protocol included adding/removing window shades, decreasing/increasing duct loss, increasing/decreasing ventilation rates, etc..  Time after time, the analysis using DOE2 was able to predict the hourly energy flows of these houses within a very small error band (on the order of 1 or 2 percent).  This required a detailed model, including all the site and self shading for that individual house.  But given detailed and correct inputs, DOE2 has no problem predicting accurate hourly energy use.

Now, add real people to these houses and all bets are off!  It is impossible to predict the individual behavior of people.  Just think, 20 years ago there were two popular singers, the wholesome Michael Jackson and the apparently perverse "Prince".  Who could have predicted that Prince would turn out to be the straight family guy and the other one would become ... well, "Michael Jackson".  Put both these guys in a house and try and predict the energy use ... no way!  Luckily, group behavior is much easier to predict and estimates of typical energy use are possible, even for residential buildings.

We've been using DOE2.2 for a couple years now, and I encourage anyone using DOE2.1 on a regular basis to check it out.  The systems/plant is much more flexible now and organized in a far more logical way.  On the loads side, the use of polygons to describe spaces makes detailed models far easier (it took me awhile to realize the advantages of this approach, but once I made the switch the time savings became very evident). The addition of "expressions" to the BDL language makes for the possibility of some extremely "smart" BDL code.  Okay okay, the possibility still exists of producing BDL code that thinks it's really smart, but really has a 2x4 stuck in the wrong place.

  "And for the retrofit industry, I STILL gotta match the utitliy meters...."
  I don't think we have any hope of ever achieving that with today's tools (or
  even those that are in the works).  Our simulation tools can't simulate *all*
  the stupid mistakes and failures that are made in building design, construction,
  and operation.  The only time you'll get your output to match the utility meter
  is if you tweek something else that probably has nothing to do with reality.
  This is just one of the things that give me pause when people talk about using
  DOE-2 (or any other engine in existence) to simulate buildings in order to
  estimate savings.  We *know* the model is wrong because it can't simulate a 2x4
  stuck in the makeup vane of an economizer by a frustrated operator trying to get
  some fresh air in a building with a messed up economizer control he can't figure
  out.  These kind of things happen all the time.

The discussion over the last few days has indeed been stimulating.  Mark
Case as hornet's ringmaster should be commended.

May I inject some reality checks into this discussion?  We have so far heard
from computer scientists, designers, and esco's, as user groups.  Clearly
there is a need for simulation out there, and serious commercial outfits
like Autodesk have made it clear in the past that they thought so, too.
Forrester Research says that in 1998 $175 Billion was spent on energy
purchases for the commercial sector alone, in the U.S.  Why don't "we" have
more of an impact on reducing, or at least influencing, that number?  Just
try to apply modern, transaction-based e-commerce thinking...

As we have seen just in our recent exchanges, the needs are very diverse.
The need to "match simulation to utility bills" is a very familiar one, as
is the need for designers to model innovative HVAC-ZONE linkages and for
researchers to try things out before they are built in the lab.

It may be simply na?ve to think that one computer program would fit all
those needs, be it DOE-2 or EnergyPlus.  In my experience, one of the
reasons commercial software distributors have generally shied away from
building simulation is because of the exorbitant complexity/focus ratio of
its developer community.  There is no way to make money by selling the space
shuttle sitting in a hangar, of which many codes may remind them.  At best a
commercial outfit would want to inquire whether the space shuttle is for
rent, and whether it makes sense for them to use it for their particular,
commercial mission.  Unfortunately, they may instead be "sold" on the
benefits of bigger and better space shuttles to come, and find no volunteers
to pilot the one they're looking at.  No wonder they walk away, like
AutoDesk.

Back to building simulation - I am concerned, and have been for a long time,
at the single-minded focus on calculation detail and uncompromising
flexibility, at the expense of focused attempts to solve one problem at a
time.  In my personal opinion,  the Pacific Energy Center's Cool Tools
project is an example of a a welcome change from this path.  But that's a
story for another day.

Back to the DOE-2 vs. EnergyPlus issue, let's try to look at this from a big
software outfit's point of view, one that is used to meet client needs with
well-targeted solutions, whether off-the-shelf or custom-made.  Such an
outfit would consider DOE-2 "legacy code" and recognize its value and needs.
Value, in that it is a hardy survivor, tested by many, and with a relatively
high degree of credibility.  The needs I don't need to enumerate here,
others have done it more cogently.  If anything, it is surprising how well
code designed in the 70's has held up over time.

Is EnergyPlus the answer?  I, for one, have hoped so for a long time.  I
have great respect for the people behind it and don't envy their task.  I am
all too familiar with the impossible situation of devlopers at the center of
wildly diverging expectations by a large and diverse customer community.
And, government funded or not, this effort must have customers.  It is easy
to be critical in this situation, and I would have no trouble adding my pet
peeves to those of many others.  But given that this effort is still under
way, and "the jury is out" as it were, it may be better to let this effort
run its course, at least through a Beta Release worthy of that designation,
before rushing to judgment.

So what should we do while we wait.  What would we do if EnergyPlus didn't
even exist?  The traditional answer (not that it has been heeded often) is
to assemble a representative group of users and beat the needs out of them.
I no longer think this process to be productive, because the needs are so
diverse.  Instead, I believe that there should be a concerted effort to woo
the commercial interests who have *experience* in the industry - building
procurement, software toolmakers, control manufacturers.  Experience means
knowing what sells and what doesn't.  Their enthusiasm or lack thereof are
our best proxies today for the broader markets' needs.

Does "the government" have a place in this?  I wholeheartedly believe so.
Only a public organization may have the credibility required to develop
unbiased, accurate tools.  In that sense, I have always liked Energy Plus's
approach to develop code with a software interface, not a user interface.
This being said, it is most unfortunate that those expected to write such
user interfaces for commercial gain are being brought in at the tail end of
the effort, rather than the beginning.  Above all, this effort needs
"buy-in" by as many constituencies as possible, especially those expected to
make it fly in the commercial market place.  So far, I am still waiting to
see this happen.

The work on DOE-2 has not slowed down; we are continuing at an equal or higher pace than the last 10 years.  We are (like others),
however, putting a lot of time and $ into the user interface's to make the programs easier to use and more reliable.  For DOE-2, we
just finished adding a number of features (which will be in versions posted within the next couple months) including photovoltaic
systems (PV modules/arrays, inverters, plus effects of array mounting including shading of building surfaces), latent/sensible
energy recovery ventilators (ERV's), spaces which include ice rinks (model includes ice/room radiative exchange and under floor
losses/heating system.)  We are continuing work in a number of other areas to improve HVAC models for both design and energy
calculations and will continue to post these versions as they become available.

Doug Maddox wrote:
"Also, is DOE2.2 more friendly to function writing than DOE2.1E? What about
DOE2.3?"

my reply: The function feature is not yet in a posted 2.2 version; it will be available in the next posted update.  It works like
before, but now all HVAC equipment will have "access points."  The later version you refer to (2.3?) is under development and has no
designation (name/number) or release date yet so should not be confused with products we have posted for general use. All versions
we post for general use are ready for such use; all software, however, has bugs ... they just have not yet all been discovered - we
fix ours are quickly as possible when discovered (or at least give you a work-around.)

Our "next generation" program includes a component based HVAC model in which pressure and temperature, and resultant flow, are
explicitly modeled; this allows the detail modeling, for example, of components on a refrigerant loop (like refrigeration systems -
or chillers), as well as secondary coolants (glycol, brine) or water loops. For example, you can describe the refrigeration "plant"
as an interconnection of  evaporator(s), suction lines, compressor(s), high side lines and condenser(s) with controls and also
select a refrigerant; all these components can be fetched from a large library of such components and assembled into a very complex
system. The piping models, for example, allow the definition of a complete real pipe network and the calculation includes details
such as the change in fluid properties, film coefficients, and pipe losses as the working fluid flows through the system.  The coil
models, for example, include DX coils that track frost accumulation and model alternative defrost mechanisms and controls.  The
overall calculation technique includes iteration with a range of algorithms to assure very rapid convergence to a "correct"
solution.

Again this is NOT a product; it is a product research project in the early stages of beta. At this time only a subset of HVAC
equipment is available in this new program; our focus at this time is refrigeration and HVAC systems for facilities like
supermarkets and refrigerated warehouses. A working beta version is available; it is not intended for general distribution. We
expect it to take at least a year before the full range of HVAC equipment is implemented and longer to complete beta testing.  Those
interested in trying it out are welcome to ask for details.  Like our other "engines", if a general release product results from
this project it will be freeware.

"And for the retrofit industry, I STILL gotta match the utitliy meters...."
I don't think we have any hope of ever achieving that with today's tools (or
even those that are in the works).  Our simulation tools can't simulate *all*
the stupid mistakes and failures that are made in building design, construction,
and operation.  The only time you'll get your output to match the utility meter
is if you tweek something else that probably has nothing to do with reality.
This is just one of the things that give me pause when people talk about using
DOE-2 (or any other engine in existence) to simulate buildings in order to
estimate savings.  We *know* the model is wrong because it can't simulate a 2x4
stuck in the makeup vane of an economizer by a frustrated operator trying to get
some fresh air in a building with a messed up economizer control he can't figure
out.  These kind of things happen all the time.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200001311809.AA092776MD07379@gard.com>

John Karaski,

I will try to address your questions.

VisualDOE and PowerDOE are competitors. The programs have some commonality,
but they are also different in many ways. PowerDOE is tightly integrated with
DOE-2.2, while VisualDOE maintains its own data structure and can more easily
use other engines such as EnergyPlus. VisualDOE is easier to use, but does
not expose all the power of DOE-2.

I believe that there should be competition in the private sector and that public 
funding should focus on providing a common foundation for private sector products,
e.g. engines like DOE-2x, software components that can be plugged into private sector
applications, and rule sets for implementing the ASHRAE Standard 90.1 energy
cost budget method, etc.

I think diversity and competition are good, as long as policies for
public investments let the market work fairly. The software that is ideal for an
HVAC contractor is not the same program that is ideal for an architect struggling
with schematic design concepts. The ideal program for a mechanical engineer is
not the best program for a lighting designer. So I guess I would prefer to see lots
of products, built from the same publicly funded foundation, but targeted toward
the needs of specific sectors of the market.

My number of 2,000 is my estimate of the User's News mailing list. However,
I think the market is much larger than this if you include mainstream architects,
engineers, ESCOs and other potential users.

If public funding were focused on engines, rule sets and software components,
then there would be no diluting of public funds. The products of public
investment would be offered to all private software developers in a consistent
manner. The public investment would be leveraged by a greater private sector
investment.

Charles asks:
I guess I do not understand why Hirsch and Associates is willing to invest its own resources in eQuest, when the SCE plan is to
offer it for free.

Answer:
Our main current business is the development of tools for this industry and the expert use of those tools in real building design;
the more the number of users of these tools grows, the more our tools are in demand, and the more our services are in demand for
both tool development and tool application.  We invest in "free" or "inexpensive" tools because we believe that such an investment
will help an emerging market grow, which in turn will increase the demand for our products and services; we take the "long" view
when deciding how to invest our dollars even though sometimes the daily pressures of paying our bills makes that choice difficult.
In any business, sustaining growth translates in sustaining market share growth; in this business the game is also market size
growth - the desired result requires "long view" investment. (Also, we REALLY enjoy what we do, so tend to want to do more than we
can find someone to pay us to do - within limits)

Also we do engines, interfaces, and specialized applications - we do not see a policy that allows public investment in engines but
not interfaces logical.  Again, the policy for public funding should be to do what is needed most, but in a way that enhances the
private sector not competes with it; use of public funding for enabling technology is almost always welcome, for products is ONLY
welcome if it is spend within the private sector through competitive awards.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200001311547.AA473884MD07322@gard.com>

It looks like my policy paper is triggering a healthy discussion and debate. This was my goal. Jeff, thanks for your response. 

What I read into Jeff's response to the policy paper is a difference of opinion about the recommended policy guidelines. Jeff is suggesting that it is appropriate for public funds to be used to develop "simple" end-use interfaces, that are offered free. The private sector, he argues, would then develop value-added interfaces as commercial products. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory has defended USDOE funding of ComCheck Plus on this basis. 
 
I disagree with Jeff and PNNL.  I do not believe that the simple-but-free/enhanced-but-costly model will work as a guideline for public investment. I certainly do not believe that users will pay an additional $1,000 for an enhanced version of, say eQuest or ComCheck Plus. If they won't pay the money, then there is no incentive for private sector investment. In making my case, let me define the market for energy analysis tools to be larger than the readers of this list. The market ought to include mainstream architects, engineers, contractors, and maybe buildng owners and managers. 
 
Consider the following information. Many in the market (see above) are currently using Energy10, a single zone model, to analyze large multiple zone buildings. Either they do not know any better or they are being mislead by the USDOE funded marketing campaign for Energy10. Most readers of this list understand that a single-zone model is pretty worthless for large buildngs, but how can this information be communicated to the larger market for energy analysis tools. It is expensive to communicate technical information to a large audience. It requires buying advertising space, going to trade shows, offering free or below-cost training, writing technical articles and other costly activities. I wish I had the exact figures, but my hunch is that the Passive Solar Industries Council (now the Sustainable Buildings Industry Council) is spending $200,000 to $400,000 per year (most of it from USDOE through NREL) promoting Energy10. An equal or larger campaign is needed to counter this campaign and explain the need for multi-zone models. 
 
In the past, people at USDOE have asked me why I care about Energy10. They argue that it is not really a competitor to VisualDOE or other DOE-2 based tools. I agree that it shouldn't be a competitor, but the larger market sees the products as equivalent. To the larger market, both programs estimate building energy use, and that is all they really understand. The four-color full page adds and glossy brochures for Energy10 do not say "avoid using this program for multiple zone buildings". 

The point of the Energy10 story is, if we can't explain the benefits of multiple-zone models to the market, how do we communicate esoteric information on advanced features that distinguish free and enhanced versions of the same software. The risks and costs are just too high for the private sector to invest. If an enhanced feature is attractive, what is to prevent it being added to the free version of the software, thus making it even harder to for the market to distinguish between the free-ware and enhanced feature software.

My recommended guidelines would limit public funding to engines, rule sets and components. In my opinion, development of end-use applications should be left entirely to the private sector. This is the only way we will achieve significant investment from the private sector and our best chance of producing software that is diverse, interoperable, and useful to the widest possible audience. The stay-away-from-user-interfaces policy is an easy-to-understand guideline that is difficult to misinterpretate. I believe it should be more widely embraced by those responsible for investing public funds. In my opinion, the simple-but-free/enhanced-but-costly model is like the camel's nose under the tent. 

Jeff raised some questions about eQuest and VisualDOE. I am not suggesting that public funds were invested correctly or responsibly in VisualDOE, eQuest or any other program for that matter. I am proposing a new and hopefully better policy that will provide guidance for future public investments.


Charles Eley
Eley Associates

P. S. Jeff is right that VisualDOE has enjoyed public funding in the past, but the magnitude of this funding is insignificant compared to the total development costs. We were willing to invest our own resources because we want to provide a useful product and because we had an opportunity to recover some of our costs through sales and support. If our public investors had told us that they wanted a license that would enable them distribute VisualDOE free, the Eley Associates investment in VisualDOE would have be reduced significantly or maybe eliminated. After all, we have to make payroll every two weeks, our rent comes due once a month, etc. I guess I do not understand why Hirsch and Associates is willing to invest its own resources in eQuest, when the SCE plan is to offer it for free.

I agree with Mr. Hall's assessment that improving DOE-2.2's present HVAC components should be higher on the priority list than developing an entirely new simulation package.  I would add that the front end also needs to be improved in order to make the model input process more intuitive than at present; this would reduce the high cost of inputing the model.  A good CAD to DOE conversion package wouldn't hurt either.  Certainly it will be years before Energyplus will be available and useful to a wide audience.  If DOE-2.2 is to be truly useful and attractive to energy modelers and designers soon, the HVAC components and the front end need to be improved.  These two items should be the priorities.  

DOE-2.2, the most promising simulation package currently available, has made significant gains in recent years due to excellent work by the program developers.  However, it is still an onerous and costly program to use and requires a high level of modeling expertise, primarily because it lacks the HVAC features outlined by Mr. Hall and subsequently requires many hours of a senior engineer.  For example, if the typical engineer can't model a DX VAV system with standard boxes on the interior and fan-powered boxes with reheat coils on the perimeter (perhaps the most common system in new buildings today), the engineer is not going to use the simulation package, end of story.  Most engineers wouldn't care if you could use 'tricks' to model the system; these are simply difficult and time-consuming tasks not worth the cost.  

DOE-2.2 is not that far away from being a great program that could be used and understood by many more good engineers.  I look forward to the developement of these important improvements.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Matching utility meters
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200001311345.AA452807MD07258@gard.com>

[Normally I snip most of the original message, but Paul's entire message is
important and I left it below]

It sounds like we agree and I'm really enjoying the discussion.  I didn't and
won't dismiss the use of energy calcs for estimating savings for the reason you
cite: it's the best we've got.  But as you suggest, I recognize their
limitations.  They've got to be used on the right jobs and in the right way to
be of real value.  As such, I do not expect to get the current generation of
simulations to match the utility meter.  We have access to extensive collections
of utility meter and submeter data and I have seen little evidence of progress
since the data seriously started to come in over 20 years ago.  We use these
engines (especially DOE-2 and BLAST) very extensively and we think we know their
strengths and weaknesses pretty well.  In the past year we have run and analyzed
the output of around 5000 parametrically generated models for various jobs and
in past years that number has reached the neighborhood of 20000 models per year.
We've learned where these models can go and where they can't go.  We're stilling
learning very significant lessons today.

In my humble opinion the crux of the matter for calculating savings is that even
if I could know when a 2x4 is stuck in a damper (which is hard enough to
predict) just about every energy calcs engine is unable to model the problem or
calculate its impact.  We have not been able to get most of the engines to
correctly model the impact of the most common problems (e.g., bad temperature
sensors, stuck dampers, improperly programmed controls, failed cooling
interlock) on economizer operation.  We learned this lesson when we tried to
generate the test data sets to verify that our diagnosticians could detect all
the problems we were looking to find. Yet as we field test the diagnosticians we
discover that these occurrences are prevalent and we are surprised how often
they go undetected by experienced operators.

Now consider the way we calculate savings (simplified of course):

	Savings = PredictedCost(Bad) - ActualCost(Good) - ActualCost(Fix)

where for good or bad operation

	Cost(X) = Rate * Simulated_Consumption(X)

In the good old days the difference between bad and good was mostly in the
basics: lights, insulation, efficiency of the HVAC, and windows and doors.
These are all things for which energy engines generally estimate impacts well,
whether for Cost(Bad) or Cost(Good0.  However, as more and more buildings get
the basic improvements made or are simply built to meet better standards, the
more difficult to model things become more significant relative to the basics.
Now the Cost(bad) part of the equation begins to break down because most energy
engines cannot even guess what might be the impact of improper sensor location,
manufacturing flaws, incorrect installation, setup/config oversights, or na?ve
operation.  Unfortunately these are not the exception, rather they are the rule.
Moreover they are the targets of interest to those in the performance
contracting business because they can be very easy/inexpensive to fix and can
have dramatic cost impacts.  As a result modelers (particularly the more
virtuoso among us) find work-arounds for these conditions in order to match
actual metered data to predicted meter readings. I believe (based mostly on my
intuition) that these proxies push the models "out of bounds".  They were never
designed to model incorrect building design or operation and should not be used
that way.  The very impact an ESPC wishes to affect cannot be estimated
directly.

Bottom line for me: if I don't know the problem is there or I can't estimate the
impact of a problem, I certainly can't match the utility meter in a realistic
way, no matter how hard I try.  Like I said before, if I do match the meter,
it's by changing something else that probably has nothing to do with the problem
I intend to fix in order to obtain savings.

To go back to John Aulbach's pain, many people feel it and I don't think there's
much that can be done to alleviate it today.  Every time I consider using an
energy calcs engine to estimate savings I have to remind myself that everything
looks like a nail when I'm holding a hammer.  I know that in this case a hammer
is sometimes all I've got, but that does make using it always right.  If I've
got to use it, I need to swing very carefully.

One last point about the modeling language I feel the need to make because it's
a subject near and dear to me as I work the IAI on the Industry Foundation
Classes.  The problem is not only in the language, but in the basic
methodologies driven by the language.  Most engines generally do not separate
the control strategy simulation from the thermal and air-flow simulation of
models.  Because of this, they cannot consider the wide range of conditions that
can cause improper operation and can result in the models "going out of bounds".
There a lot of very good reasons for this.  But take a seemingly simple problem:
a bad temperature sensor.  It is extremely difficult (and I believe impossible
but I'm still waiting to be proven wrong) to simulate the impact of this problem
on the economizer control signals using the most popular energy savings
calculation tools.  Thus the bad behavior of the economizer cannot be replicated
correctly.  Therefore the savings obtained by correcting this problem cannot be
quantified well using such engines.  Once the problem with the methodology is
remedied, then we could be talk about whether and how the language needs to be
modified.

Cheer up.  We're still way ahead of the game.

	I really must take some exception to your dismissal of using DOE2 to
calculate energy savings.  After all, what do you think people use DOE2, or any
other energy simulation program, for?
	 
	We have done far more projects using DOE2 to estimate energy savings
than I care to think about.  The answers produced by the analysis must be taken
with some caveats, but in general, they are the best available estimate of
savings reasonably attainable.  Part of what you are getting at, I believe, it
the fact that people's behavior on an individual scale is unknowable and that
generalized answers do not necessarily apply to specific cases.
	 
	In a commercial building this may manifest itself in the fact that part
of a building is unexpectedly unoccupied, or that the facilities guy stuck a 2x4
in the outside air damper to get rid of "that stink in suite 302".  If you did
not anticipate these factors, then of course the energy prediction will be less
accurate.  On the other hand, if you could predict these factors, then DOE2
would have no problem accounting for them.  If you want to conduct an energy
savings analysis for a specific building, an audit is really required.  If you
enter an accurate description of the building and its operation, then DOE2 does
an extremely good job of predicting its energy use.  And that is what DOE2 is
intended to do.  It, of course, cannot predict deviant and unexpected behavior
in the building operation on it's own ... the person modeling the building must
do this.
	 
	If you apply savings analysis for a "typical" small office to a specific
building operating under specific conditions, then yes, there is and should be
significantly less confidence in the answer.  This is an issue for the analysis
itself, and is not a limitation of the analysis tool.
	 
	In residential buildings, this phenomena is even more evident.  We have
used DOE2.2 to predict the energy flows of residential homes throughout the
U.S.. These houses were operated under test conditions, and actual energy flows
were measured using co-heating and co-cooling techniques.  The test protocol
included adding/removing window shades, decreasing/increasing duct loss,
increasing/decreasing ventilation rates, etc..  Time after time, the analysis
using DOE2 was able to predict the hourly energy flows of these houses within a
very small error band (on the order of 1 or 2 percent).  This required a
detailed model, including all the site and self shading for that individual
house.  But given detailed and correct inputs, DOE2 has no problem predicting
accurate hourly energy use.
	 
	Now, add real people to these houses and all bets are off!  It is
impossible to predict the individual behavior of people.  Just think, 20 years
ago there were two popular singers, the wholesome Michael Jackson and the
apparently perverse "Prince".  Who could have predicted that Prince would turn
out to be the straight family guy and the other one would become ... well,
"Michael Jackson".  Put both these guys in a house and try and predict the
energy use ... no way!  Luckily, group behavior is much easier to predict and
estimates of typical energy use are possible, even for residential buildings.
	 
	We've been using DOE2.2 for a couple years now, and I encourage anyone
using DOE2.1 on a regular basis to check it out.  The systems/plant is much more
flexible now and organized in a far more logical way.  On the loads side, the
use of polygons to describe spaces makes detailed models far easier (it took me
awhile to realize the advantages of this approach, but once I made the switch
the time savings became very evident). The addition of "expressions" to the BDL
language makes for the possibility of some extremely "smart" BDL code.  Okay
okay, the possibility still exists of producing BDL code that thinks it's really
smart, but really has a 2x4 stuck in the wrong place.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200001311329.AA290829MD07243@gard.com>

Charles,
 
I read your attachment.  Thanks.  I am confused about one issue, though:
Since PowerDOE has a graphical interface and uses DOE2.2 as the simulation
engine, where does that leave VisualDOE?  In Strategy #2?  These seem to be
competing rather than cooperating products going after a very small market
(2000 users by your numbers).
 
If VisualDOE does anything better than PowerDOE, maybe those advanced
features could be integrated into PowerDOE?  This addresses, in a arguably
basic way, the public funds issue Jeff Hirsch raised.
 
The market appears, in my humble and non-expert opinion, to be too small to
support all the simulation software packages currently available.  This
might be diluting public funds.  Again, that's just a wild guess on my part,
but I'd rather have one awesome product vs. many good ones.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Hornet's Next - Policy for Public Investment in Energy
Software




Back in October, I wrote down some ideas on how public funds ought to be
invested in energy software. I shared the paper with a few friends, but have
not "gone public" with it. Since a lot of the issues raised in the "hornet's
nest" series are addressed in the paper, I feel now is an appropriate time
to share my views with others. The central theme of the proposed policy is
that public investments ought to be made in a way that encourage private
sector software developers to invest their own funds. This will leverage
scarce public funds. Too often public investments in energy software have
had the opposite effect, causing private developers to scale back or even
withdraw from the business. The paper offers guidelines, which I think would
achieve this goal. At this point, the opinions in the policy paper are mine
and mine alone.. I welcome your comments.
 
To address a few additional points raised in the "hornet's nest" series:
 
VisualDOE 2.6 has a rudimentary link with CADD programs that works OK, but
is not perfect. The problem is that about 90% or more of CADD files are not
object oriented. In reality they are little more than a collection of lines,
arcs and circles. We can recognize a line in the file, but often do not know
if it represents a edge of a wall, the centerline of a duct, or a joint in
the concrete floor. Until more CADD programs become object oriented and
carry around the properties that matter to modelers, there is not much point
in making a link. 
 
The latest version of VisualDOE, Version 3.0, works with DOE-2.2. An
announcement was made in the Summer 1999 issue of the User's News. However,
the newsletter editors removed all reference to "DOE-2.2" before the article
was published, so the only way to know that DOE-2.2 is supported is to make
a connection with the new features that are discussed in the article. The
"hornet's nest" has prevented us from officially releasing Version 3.0.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200001311220.AA204851MD07218@gard.com>

First of all, the whole "hornet's nest" discussion has been quite interesting.

If I may add my two cents:  
As you can probably tell by the nature of the questions I have been asking this group, I am a relative newcomer to the world of building simulation.  This is not to say that I am doing simulations without any supervision or understanding of what's going on in the simulation and how it compares with "reality."

In the process of learning how do to these simulations, I have found the graphical interface of PowerDOE very helpful.  The HVAC system diagrams, the building views, and the help file (even if it isn't 100% complete) have made a big difference in how fast I am picking up the details and understanding all of this.   

So I disagree with the perception that programs like PowerDOE allow newcomers to cheat their way around the "rite of passage" that experienced modelers have taken with text based energy simulation programs.  If anything, I think that the graphical nature of PowerDOE helps make my simulations more accurate, because I can understand what's going on better than I could if all I was looking at was a bunch of text.

Anyway, enough said.  The real reason for this email was to ask how to model hot gas reheat for a PSZ system.  Anyone have any suggestions?

Alec

I agree with Dan on the complexity of skin load calculations especially when
the internal gains are the driving
force in Heating and Cooling.  From a Electric Utility prospective,  a
powerful Hvac simulation is more important
than putting all that horsepower on the skin of the building.
Looking at our commercial customers, 80% of them are 200kw and under, so a
scaled down simulation
will do the job for most Energy Analysis or audits. We cannot spend
thousands of dollars performing
an energy audit on a "Mom and Pop"  grocery store. Since there is no profit
for an Engineer to
do these small jobs we do them,  with a trade off for good results vs time
spent on the job.
Our company performed 8,000 audits last year with a simple tool like
MicroAXCESS and
investigating the end result,  they were very reasonable -- not totally
accurate but good.

On large jobs we use better tools and also spent more time and effort.

This has been the most stimulating discussion so far in this group.  I
think it is long overdue, because the impasse over DOE 2.2 and Energyplus
threatens to keep improved simulation tools out of the hands of users for
some time to come.  This is particularly frustrating because of the promise
of Doe2.2, which still could benefit from numerous additional HVAC
alternatives.  The circulation loop method of building systems is very
attractive and offers flexibility not available on any other program.  I
submit that the addition of packaged water-cooled VAV/PIU systems, a
revised and expanded scheme for waterside economizer, the addition of
cooling coil run-around heat recovery, the addition of photovoltaic
systems, and other components would be of much greater immediate benefit
than the revamping of the loads calculation procedure promised for Energyplus.

I must admit that I am mystified by the appeal of the energy balance
approach to loads-calculation for annual energy analysis.  In order
accurately to calculate the differential radiation balance among interior
surfaces, one must input those surfaces explicitly.  This would include
breaking down larger surfaces into a number of smaller surfaces in order to
accommodate surface temperature variations across the surface or within the
adjacent air mass.  This would be particularly important for any insolated
surface, and it would become necessary to calculate exactly the surface
components in direct sunlight.  In order to accommodate any air temperature
stratification that might occur, it would be necessary to input several air
temperature nodes and specify the coupling between them and different
surfaces.   The more complex becomes the load calculation, the more
difficult simultaneous solution of systems and zone air temperature
becomes. Ultimately, the loads program becomes a computational fluid
dynamics simulation with conjugate heat transfer. One has to question
whether this degree of complexity is appropriate for an annual energy
analysis, especially for a 40 story high-rise office building, or a medical
research laboratory.  It seems more appropriate to a short time period
investigation of temperature distributions within a single space or group
of spaces, a very legitimate investigation that is currently handled very
well by programs such as ESP-R, but one which perhaps should not be the
primary focus for federal funding in this area.

First, take a deep breath ... 

The basic ideas Charles expresses are, in my view, on track.  But some of
the details are biased toward his interests.  For example, VisualDOE and eQUEST
have both benefited from substantial support from California utilities use of "Public
Goods Charge" (PGC) funds. Both have had very substantial investment by
their developing companies (Eley for VisualDOE and JJHirsch for eQUEST.)
eQUEST is freeware for users and can be licensed by anyone for further
development without per copy royalty.  VisualDOE, currently, is marketed
as a commercial product.  So, I do not understand; under the policy
proposed is it suggested that eQUEST should be sold for a fee and not licensed
for further development, or that VisualDOE should be treated the same a
eQUEST - freeware and source licensed to anyone, or that neither should
have been funded in the first place?

Policy can treat private funded projects differently from Government funded
projects but for the policy to work it must treat different Government funded
projects similarly and different private funded projects similarly.

Obviously the key here is that both VisualDOE and eQUEST would not exist without
the combination of public and private investment; the partnership that Charles' paper
describes.  In both cases, I believe, the public funding should "extract" some
public benefit - such as the basic product being freeware (or very cheap) for
end users and the source being available (cheap) for developers - but the
private funding should provide some advantage to the developer as a "reward"
for their private investment.  I think the "reward" is that the private developers
get a head start, they retain copyright (so have an advantage over open source
in being able to do private products based on the starting point), and they gain
the internal know-how/experience from the project.  Future such public-private
partnerships should allow the developers to continue to retain ownership
of the copyright, but require that the "starting point" which is developed using
the public funds be placed out as open source under a Mozilla-like license; the
developer could, however, continue on with their original source copy to develop
private version licensed in any way they see fit.

The California investor owned utilities (and EPRI), when deciding to support
QUEST development "extracted" the public benefit but other California utilities,
when deciding to support VisualDOE, Cool Tools, and other related projects,
did not "extract" much that is yet seen.  This later case should change.  A similar
problem exists with California Public Interest Energy Research (PIER)
funding; they are spending millions on software tools in this field, but have
not published the terms to be used in the licenses for the resultant software.

When the support for the software comes ENTIRELY from public funds - be it
DOE, CEC/PIER, etc. - the ENTIRE resulting work should be made open
source under the BSD-like license so that anyone can run with it in any way.
Such software should not use the Mozilla-like open source license, as that format
was intended for use when the posted source contains substantial private 
investment; the Mozilla format "rewards" the copyright holder by leveling the
playing field for all but him/her who decided to make their private work open.

For EnergyPlus, Energy10, DBA, Radiance, Superlite, Window-4, BLAST,
CalERDA-1 through DOE-2.1C, and all the many such fully publicly funded software,
the route to take is clear: BSD-like license so that anyone can run with it in
any way on a level playing field.  However, I also believe that we don't need full
packaged commercial products from 100% government funds using 100%
directed procurements (sole source contracting); full products, if needed, should
be bid out as open procurements with a requirement for real cost-sharing.
If no bidder is willing to put up private money (not just another pot of public funds)
it is doubtful the product is needed.  If a full product is needed, it is best developed
within the private sector by companies who will, in the end, need to market it and
support it and who probably also understand the customer needs better than the
US Government, National Labs, or other public funding sources.

That said, however, I am 100% in favor of Government funding of basic algorithm, 
model and technology development; as I have said before, many advancements
in this field would not exist without this funding.  EnergyPlus the LBNL/UI
commercial product - NO; EnergyPlus the BSD-like open source simulation
toolkit maintained by LBNL and UI (and hopefully others in the future) - YES.
Energy10 the NREL commercial product - NO; Energy10 the BSD-like open source 
toolkit copyrighted by winning bidder XYZ company (and the private by-product
being XYZE10+ enhanced $1000 version) - YES.  VisualDOE the commercial
product - NO; VisualDOE the Mozilla-like open source toolkit copyrighted
by winning bidder Eley Associates (and the private by-product being Eley
VisualDOE+ enhanced $1000 version) - YES.  eQUEST the commercial
product - NO; eQUEST the Mozilla-like open source simulation and interface toolkit
copyrighted by winning bidder JJHirsch Associates (and the private by-product
being JJH eQUESTpro enhanced $1000 version - well, we pass on that one for
now, but reserve the right to do it) - YES.  

DOE-2 is a good example - we used several million dollars of private money 
in addition to several hundred thousand of public money (DOE and CA PGC
funds) to do our part of DOE-2.1D, DOE-2.1E and DOE-2.2.  We could
not have done this if the DOE-2 portions supported by DOE had a royalty
attached or had licensing that restricted redistribution (like Mozilla or like
the proposed, even more restrictive licensing for EnergyPlus) since we
could not have demonstrated to our private funders how THEY would
benefit.  DOE "extracted" from us royalty free DOE-2.2 distribution to the
public; even though US Government contracting of software development to
small businesses requires no such license grant for the privately funded
portions, DOE felt this DOE-2.2 license grant was required to fulfill their
public interest responsibility (though they have chosen, so far, not to
use that license grant to distribute DOE-2.2 to the public.) This is also
why I raised the question: does the user/developer community believe
we should move to open source licensing for DOE-2?


The policy should not be to say that US public money should be spend on engines but
not interfaces; the policy should be - if the need exists, the priority is high enough,
and the private sector cannot do it well enough or fast enough alone, plus 
US public funds are available, then do it all ... but do it in a way that partners with,
enables, and enhances the competitiveness of US companies in the world market.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Hornet's Next - Policy for Public Investment in Energy Software
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200001301513.AA135846MD07000@gard.com>

Back in October, I wrote down some ideas on how public funds ought to be invested in energy software. I shared the paper with a few friends, but have not "gone public" with it. Since a lot of the issues raised in the "hornet's nest" series are addressed in the paper, I feel now is an appropriate time to share my views with others. The central theme of the proposed policy is that public investments ought to be made in a way that encourage private sector software developers to invest their own funds. This will leverage scarce public funds. Too often public investments in energy software have had the opposite effect, causing private developers to scale back or even withdraw from the business. The paper offers guidelines, which I think would achieve this goal. At this point, the opinions in the policy paper are mine and mine alone.. I welcome your comments.

To address a few additional points raised in the "hornet's nest" series:

VisualDOE 2.6 has a rudimentary link with CADD programs that works OK, but is not perfect. The problem is that about 90% or more of CADD files are not object oriented. In reality they are little more than a collection of lines, arcs and circles. We can recognize a line in the file, but often do not know if it represents a edge of a wall, the centerline of a duct, or a joint in the concrete floor. Until more CADD programs become object oriented and carry around the properties that matter to modelers, there is not much point in making a link. 

The latest version of VisualDOE, Version 3.0, works with DOE-2.2. An announcement was made in the Summer 1999 issue of the User's News. However, the newsletter editors removed all reference to "DOE-2.2" before the article was published, so the only way to know that DOE-2.2 is supported is to make a connection with the new features that are discussed in the article. The "hornet's nest" has prevented us from officially releasing Version 3.0.

"Pictures are nice, but pretty pictures of airplanes doesn't get the airplanes built or off the ground."

I believe that the 3D and 2D rendering of the building geometry is essential in producing an accurate model of a complex building.  Do you think they built better airplanes without any renderings or visual models?  Think again.  Until Joe Huang's DrawBDL came out, even models produced by the national lab responsible for DOE2 development had some incorrect geometry. Misplaced a wall or window? .... impossible to tell just by looking at BDL code.

  I used the Meriwether ESAS hourly analysis program from 1977 through 1984
  and the DOE-2.1 A through E since 1984 to date. The problem with all the
  DOE-2 interfaces is that the user STILL has to understand DOE-2, what it's
  keywords are, and what is actually trying to be modeled. Real engineering
  and energy dynamics insite must accompany any model effort, to truly
  represent what the building is, and what it can become (ECMs).
   
  I have been exposed to PowerDOE but don't yet have time to learn the
  geometry games it requires up front. PowerDOE will be nice to show a client
  the building geometry reproduce from the model input, but I am not in the
  pictoral rendering game. Rather, I need to demonstrate to the client the
  results of PS-E, how they change per ECM, and the correct dynamics of the
  utitliy rates as each ECM changes. Pictures are nice, but pretty pictures of
  airplanes doesn't get the airplanes built or off the ground.
   
  Another mistake production DOE-2 using companies use is trying to use DOE-2
  as a DESIGN program, rathher than an ENERGY ANALYSIS program.  A TRACE or
  Carrier E-20 is still far better at assessing exact coil sizes and airflows.
  There is not enought SYSTEMS information coming out to make me feel
  comfortable in ever using it accurately for design.
   
  It really took me 5 - 6 years to REALLY learn what DOE-2 does and doesn't do
  (and I STILL forget). And now another program is to be placed upon us
  (EnergyPlus) that we will have to learn the idiosyncrasies of.
   
  And for the retrofit industry, I STILL gotta match the utitliy meters....

I really must take some exception to your dismissal of using DOE2 to calculate energy savings.  After all, what do you think people use DOE2, or any other energy simulation program, for?

We have done far more projects using DOE2 to estimate energy savings than I care to think about.  The answers produced by the analysis must be taken with some caveats, but in general, they are the best available estimate of savings reasonably attainable.  Part of what you are getting at, I believe, it the fact that people's behavior on an individual scale is unknowable and that generalized answers do not necessarily apply to specific cases.

In a commercial building this may manifest itself in the fact that part of a building is unexpectedly unoccupied, or that the facilities guy stuck a 2x4 in the outside air damper to get rid of "that stink in suite 302".  If you did not anticipate these factors, then of course the energy prediction will be less accurate.  On the other hand, if you could predict these factors, then DOE2 would have no problem accounting for them.  If you want to conduct an energy savings analysis for a specific building, an audit is really required.  If you enter an accurate description of the building and its operation, then DOE2 does an extremely good job of predicting its energy use.  And that is what DOE2 is intended to do.  It, of course, cannot predict deviant and unexpected behavior in the building operation on it's own ... the person modeling the building must do this.

If you apply savings analysis for a "typical" small office to a specific building operating under specific conditions, then yes, there is and should be significantly less confidence in the answer.  This is an issue for the analysis itself, and is not a limitation of the analysis tool.

In residential buildings, this phenomena is even more evident.  We have used DOE2.2 to predict the energy flows of residential homes throughout the U.S.. These houses were operated under test conditions, and actual energy flows were measured using co-heating and co-cooling techniques.  The test protocol included adding/removing window shades, decreasing/increasing duct loss, increasing/decreasing ventilation rates, etc..  Time after time, the analysis using DOE2 was able to predict the hourly energy flows of these houses within a very small error band (on the order of 1 or 2 percent).  This required a detailed model, including all the site and self shading for that individual house.  But given detailed and correct inputs, DOE2 has no problem predicting accurate hourly energy use.

Now, add real people to these houses and all bets are off!  It is impossible to predict the individual behavior of people.  Just think, 20 years ago there were two popular singers, the wholesome Michael Jackson and the apparently perverse "Prince".  Who could have predicted that Prince would turn out to be the straight family guy and the other one would become ... well, "Michael Jackson".  Put both these guys in a house and try and predict the energy use ... no way!  Luckily, group behavior is much easier to predict and estimates of typical energy use are possible, even for residential buildings.

We've been using DOE2.2 for a couple years now, and I encourage anyone using DOE2.1 on a regular basis to check it out.  The systems/plant is much more flexible now and organized in a far more logical way.  On the loads side, the use of polygons to describe spaces makes detailed models far easier (it took me awhile to realize the advantages of this approach, but once I made the switch the time savings became very evident). The addition of "expressions" to the BDL language makes for the possibility of some extremely "smart" BDL code.  Okay okay, the possibility still exists of producing BDL code that thinks it's really smart, but really has a 2x4 stuck in the wrong place.

  "And for the retrofit industry, I STILL gotta match the utitliy meters...."
  I don't think we have any hope of ever achieving that with today's tools (or
  even those that are in the works).  Our simulation tools can't simulate *all*
  the stupid mistakes and failures that are made in building design, construction,
  and operation.  The only time you'll get your output to match the utility meter
  is if you tweek something else that probably has nothing to do with reality.
  This is just one of the things that give me pause when people talk about using
  DOE-2 (or any other engine in existence) to simulate buildings in order to
  estimate savings.  We *know* the model is wrong because it can't simulate a 2x4
  stuck in the makeup vane of an economizer by a frustrated operator trying to get
  some fresh air in a building with a messed up economizer control he can't figure
  out.  These kind of things happen all the time.

The discussion over the last few days has indeed been stimulating.  Mark
Case as hornet's ringmaster should be commended.

May I inject some reality checks into this discussion?  We have so far heard
from computer scientists, designers, and esco's, as user groups.  Clearly
there is a need for simulation out there, and serious commercial outfits
like Autodesk have made it clear in the past that they thought so, too.
Forrester Research says that in 1998 $175 Billion was spent on energy
purchases for the commercial sector alone, in the U.S.  Why don't "we" have
more of an impact on reducing, or at least influencing, that number?  Just
try to apply modern, transaction-based e-commerce thinking...

As we have seen just in our recent exchanges, the needs are very diverse.
The need to "match simulation to utility bills" is a very familiar one, as
is the need for designers to model innovative HVAC-ZONE linkages and for
researchers to try things out before they are built in the lab.

It may be simply na?ve to think that one computer program would fit all
those needs, be it DOE-2 or EnergyPlus.  In my experience, one of the
reasons commercial software distributors have generally shied away from
building simulation is because of the exorbitant complexity/focus ratio of
its developer community.  There is no way to make money by selling the space
shuttle sitting in a hangar, of which many codes may remind them.  At best a
commercial outfit would want to inquire whether the space shuttle is for
rent, and whether it makes sense for them to use it for their particular,
commercial mission.  Unfortunately, they may instead be "sold" on the
benefits of bigger and better space shuttles to come, and find no volunteers
to pilot the one they're looking at.  No wonder they walk away, like
AutoDesk.

Back to building simulation - I am concerned, and have been for a long time,
at the single-minded focus on calculation detail and uncompromising
flexibility, at the expense of focused attempts to solve one problem at a
time.  In my personal opinion,  the Pacific Energy Center's Cool Tools
project is an example of a a welcome change from this path.  But that's a
story for another day.

Back to the DOE-2 vs. EnergyPlus issue, let's try to look at this from a big
software outfit's point of view, one that is used to meet client needs with
well-targeted solutions, whether off-the-shelf or custom-made.  Such an
outfit would consider DOE-2 "legacy code" and recognize its value and needs.
Value, in that it is a hardy survivor, tested by many, and with a relatively
high degree of credibility.  The needs I don't need to enumerate here,
others have done it more cogently.  If anything, it is surprising how well
code designed in the 70's has held up over time.

Is EnergyPlus the answer?  I, for one, have hoped so for a long time.  I
have great respect for the people behind it and don't envy their task.  I am
all too familiar with the impossible situation of devlopers at the center of
wildly diverging expectations by a large and diverse customer community.
And, government funded or not, this effort must have customers.  It is easy
to be critical in this situation, and I would have no trouble adding my pet
peeves to those of many others.  But given that this effort is still under
way, and "the jury is out" as it were, it may be better to let this effort
run its course, at least through a Beta Release worthy of that designation,
before rushing to judgment.

So what should we do while we wait.  What would we do if EnergyPlus didn't
even exist?  The traditional answer (not that it has been heeded often) is
to assemble a representative group of users and beat the needs out of them.
I no longer think this process to be productive, because the needs are so
diverse.  Instead, I believe that there should be a concerted effort to woo
the commercial interests who have *experience* in the industry - building
procurement, software toolmakers, control manufacturers.  Experience means
knowing what sells and what doesn't.  Their enthusiasm or lack thereof are
our best proxies today for the broader markets' needs.

Does "the government" have a place in this?  I wholeheartedly believe so.
Only a public organization may have the credibility required to develop
unbiased, accurate tools.  In that sense, I have always liked Energy Plus's
approach to develop code with a software interface, not a user interface.
This being said, it is most unfortunate that those expected to write such
user interfaces for commercial gain are being brought in at the tail end of
the effort, rather than the beginning.  Above all, this effort needs
"buy-in" by as many constituencies as possible, especially those expected to
make it fly in the commercial market place.  So far, I am still waiting to
see this happen.

The frustrating thing for any DOE2 user who's been using the program since it was CalERDA is that some real progress has developed

several years for EnergyPlus.

my reply:
The work on DOE-2 has not slowed down; we are continuing at an equal or higher pace than the last 10 years.  We are (like others),
however, putting a lot of time and $ into the user interface's to make the programs easier to use and more reliable.  For DOE-2, we
just finished adding a number of features (which will be in versions posted within the next couple months) including photovoltaic
systems (PV modules/arrays, inverters, plus effects of array mounting including shading of building surfaces), latent/sensible
energy recovery ventilators (ERV's), spaces which include ice rinks (model includes ice/room radiative exchange and under floor
losses/heating system.)  We are continuing work in a number of other areas to improve HVAC models for both design and energy
calculations and will continue to post these versions as they become available.

Doug Maddox wrote:
"Also, is DOE2.2 more friendly to function writing than DOE2.1E? What about
DOE2.3?"

my reply: The function feature is not yet in a posted 2.2 version; it will be available in the next posted update.  It works like
before, but now all HVAC equipment will have "access points."  The later version you refer to (2.3?) is under development and has no
designation (name/number) or release date yet so should not be confused with products we have posted for general use. All versions
we post for general use are ready for such use; all software, however, has bugs ... they just have not yet all been discovered - we
fix ours are quickly as possible when discovered (or at least give you a work-around.)

Our "next generation" program includes a component based HVAC model in which pressure and temperature, and resultant flow, are
explicitly modeled; this allows the detail modeling, for example, of components on a refrigerant loop (like refrigeration systems -
or chillers), as well as secondary coolants (glycol, brine) or water loops. For example, you can describe the refrigeration "plant"
as an interconnection of  evaporator(s), suction lines, compressor(s), high side lines and condenser(s) with controls and also
select a refrigerant; all these components can be fetched from a large library of such components and assembled into a very complex
system. The piping models, for example, allow the definition of a complete real pipe network and the calculation includes details
such as the change in fluid properties, film coefficients, and pipe losses as the working fluid flows through the system.  The coil
models, for example, include DX coils that track frost accumulation and model alternative defrost mechanisms and controls.  The
overall calculation technique includes iteration with a range of algorithms to assure very rapid convergence to a "correct"
solution.

Again this is NOT a product; it is a product research project in the early stages of beta. At this time only a subset of HVAC
equipment is available in this new program; our focus at this time is refrigeration and HVAC systems for facilities like
supermarkets and refrigerated warehouses. A working beta version is available; it is not intended for general distribution. We
expect it to take at least a year before the full range of HVAC equipment is implemented and longer to complete beta testing.  Those
interested in trying it out are welcome to ask for details.  Like our other "engines", if a general release product results from
this project it will be freeware.

Softdesk was purchased by AutoDesk several years ago.  The last software
release by Softdesk was version 7.2.  I use the building systems (HVAC,
Plumbing and Piping) daily with AutoCAD R13.  AutoDesk released version
8 of these programs, but it was only an upgrade to be compatible with
Release 14 of AutoCAD.  I can't find any record in any of my old
Softdesk information that even mentions Softdesk Energy.  Are you sure
it was ever actually a commercial product?

For the latest release of AutoCAD (2000) the HVAC, Plumbing and Piping
portions of Softdesk were not upgraded, only the Architectural portion. 
AutoCAD has stated that these portions will be updated later (estimated
- 2 years).  In effect AutoCAD has dropped this portion of the Softdesk
market.  I would guess they would also have stopped any development of
the energy program.  

If you find a copy, I'd like to look at it.

I agree completly with your rant. Buildings and their M&E systems are
inherently very complex, much more so than most people believe. My comment
addresses helping non-modelers understand what's happening and training new
modelers - not necessarily making it `easier' for inexperienced people to do
ES work.

Mark,

You've struck a nerve of sorts with your comment of non-modelers or new
modelers using PowerDOE or other graphical interface to do ES work.  These
packages allow for gross error in system simulation when used by the
inexperienced modeler or the office "computer guy" who doesn't have any HVAC
experience.  I get called in to review projects frequently when our clients
are doubting savings that have been submitted.  You would not believe the
mistakes that are made!

Sorry for the rant, but I'm also getting tired the people who think they can
purchase Power or Visual DOE and be a DOE2 expert in a week with no prior
experience -- simulation, HVAC design or otherwise.  I get calls like this
at least once a month on average.  As deregulation looms, the frequency of
this seems to be going up.

My comment on the usefulness of PD was only based on its speed due to the
computation demand the software places on the hardware.  Where we want to
use PD the most is with the 500+ space buildings we need to simulate in 3-D,
with all surfaces defined.  Unfortunately, our current operating budget has
not allowed us to purchase the fastest hardware out there.  This is a
company issue and not a true problem with PD.

Historically, DOE-2 market penetration in Oregon has been excellent.  Most
M/E design firms in Portland have had at one time someone on their staff who
could at least put together a rudimentary model using DOE-2.  This was due
to the $$$ that BPA, PacifiCorp and PGE had available on projects.

Today however, market penetration is weak.  There are really only three
names that come up seriously in the Oregon DOE-2 commercial market: Curtis
Clark, Mike Hatten, and John Karasaki (me).  I don't mean to offend or
forget anyone else in Oregon that may be doing DOE-2 modeling.  I am saying,
however, that if someone wants hard core analysis of complicated mechanical
systems, complex architectural buildings, or analysis of innovative
electrical systems, the three people I mentioned are usually on the top of
the selection list.

Our firm has a high % of using ES in new design.  ES is usually used to help
make major equipment purchasing decisions.  I can't speak about other design
firms, but I'd guess Mike Hatten incorporates ES into his projects since
they do design as well.

Eley and associates market the fact that Visual DOE has the CAD interface
you ask about.  I haven't used it, but others in our firm have with very
limited success.  We have stopped trying to do this and are waiting until
Eley jumps on the DOE-2.2 bandwagon (not that I've heard that they ever
will, though).

P.S.  My understanding is that in Utah, there are really only 2 firms,
including yours, that are doing real ES work.  And that the work done by the
Utah ES people is top drawer.

John P. Karasaki, P.E.

We've had good luck using both PD and 2.2, often in conjunction. PD can bog
down but with many of our projects it is very useful for showing
non-modelers or new modelers what is happening. Once a PD model is 95-100%
complete we'll start using 2.2 if necessary.


Question: Does anyone know what the `market penetration' energy simulation
(ES)is? What % of design firms use it some of their projects? Most of their
projects? In what % of total new design is ES used? (In Utah it is a very
small fraction indeed!)

Question: Does anyone have much experience with CAD to energy simulation
software? I've heard it exists but frankly have never seen it. Would this
type of interface - say DXF to DOE2.2 or EnergyPlus - have much impact on
market penetration?

Can anyone from DOE or one of the research institutions associated with the
EnergyPlus program explain what their thinking is regarding high quality
user interfaces for the EP simulation code? Is there a plan, beyond hoping
the private market will see enough potential for an interface that they will
create one?

Mark,

I brought this issue up earlier last year and didn't see much dust fly.
Jeff Hirsch was kind enough to post what was going on.

PowerDoe hasn't been very useful for us.  Our buildings tend to be fairly
large with alot of detail, so it is easy to bring PowerDoe to a crawl on
both the P-pro 200 and PIII 300 machines we have.

I'm very happy with what Jeff has done with DOE 2.2 and am even happier that
he is supporting and advancing it.  I don't think DOE would be able to do as
good a job as Jeff has done.  They tend to take on too large chunks at a
time and complicate things.

It would be nice if DOE provided grants or other funding for private
developers to continue work on DOE 2.2.  However, I don't see this is
plausible since they have spent thousands (millions?) on EnergyPlus already.
I don't think it's likely that anything which competes with EnergyPlus will
see any government funding.  And even though I'm typically an optimist, I
don't think that even a letter from everyone on this list, or every DOE2
user in the world would change their minds and direction.  Hopefully, I'll
be proven wrong.

Most of you are undoubtedly aware of the recent controversy over DOE2.2
PowerDoe and EnergyPlus. I know that many people on this list are actively
involved in one or more of these programs.
I think this list is as good a place as any to start a serious discussion
about where things are going, why, and how we (users of the tools) feel
about these things.

I'll start by boldly stating that I don't believe EnergyPlus will provide a
truly useful (on-the-ground useful) tool for many years to come. The history
of DOE and the national labs in creating and releasing such software is not
very good.
Are the labs and developers trying to create a product useable in a
competitive design consulting world? The last thing we need is another
arcane simulation package with no front end or post processor - been there,
done that. Perhaps new algorithyms and advanced coding are needed but
without the interface they won't help me at all. I'd rather use the `older'
ones and keep the ability to show designers what I'm doing.

One more comment and question - the DOE is spending our money to create new
code and have arguably abandoned the multi-million dollar investment in
previous DOE2.x developent. Is this the best use of taxpayer money?

Come on everybody - don't be afraid to weigh-in on this - let's hear your
thoughts!

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200001281124.AA242001MD06490@gard.com>

I was the project manager for Softdesk Energy.  I know for a fact that Autodesk
did not develop it's energy module beyond the condition it was in when the
acquired it as a part of AutoArchitect.  At the time were in the process of
developing a link to the equipment/duct modules of HVAC when Autodesk bought
Softdesk and DOE committed it's energy calcs resources to EnergyPlus
exclusively.  

Softdesk provided the energy module free of charge to all AutoArchitect users.
We were told the disks (I believe 2 of them) were included with every AutoArch
7.2 and 7.5 package.  Our records from Softdesk show that more than 10,000
copies were shipped to users.  My understanding is that when Autodesk upgraded
AutoArchitect to support Release 14, Energy was dropped rather than put it
through a comprehensive QA process again.  I guess they didn't have people who
could make the determination that it worked properly and were uninclined to farm
that job out to anyone.  I still have the source code to the entire system on my
computer and I can run it.  If a sufficiently large number of would-be users
come forward with money in hand, I am quite sure we get it out there again.
Technical it's not a problem.  Financially it's not likely to interest those
with the money.  Another case where the golden rule applies (those with the gold
make the rules).  

I also would love to resurrect the HVAC module linkage that was under
development.  It was much more capable in that it did not just look at the
envelope and estimate loads.  It was capable of collecting information about
rooms and the HVAC system and deliver that information to Trane's sizing
software.  It was abandoned when Autodesk decided not to continue shipping
Energy.

There was another module that had been prototyped and was on hold.  It was
capable of interfacing AutoArchitect to code compliance engines.  We had
demonstrated the capability on MECcheck and it was quite simple to use.  You
basically specified which energy code you wanted to check against and it
collected everything it needed from the drawing.  Anything that was not found
was either defaulted based on previous designs or supplied by the user.  It told
you whether you complied, and if not, just what part of your design was the most
problematic.

A few years ago, when the IAI (International Alliance for Interoperability)
promised back-compatible IFC (Industry Foundation Class) releases every 9 months
to support the data interchanged required to make all this work, the decision
was made to hold off on trying to solve the data exchange problem for each of
the products on a one-off basis.  Unfortunately in the era of Congressional
cutbacks we have been overcome by events: the IFC failed to meet expectations
and the generation of products that are IFC compliant has not yet matured.  In
the interim, with insufficient funding and little sympathy for efficiency
programs, there was no money for contingencies to keep the existing products
compatible with the ever-evolving platforms they need to work.  All our eggs in
the the IFC/EnergyPlus basket.

<soapbox>My concern with EnergyPlus is that it will take longer to complete than
the lifetime of technology on which it depends.  We had a suite of products that
supported existing/evolving technology at a low cost and covered a range of
design environments.  We haven't seen much progress in 5 years (some think even
more) and the prospects for achieving the promise envisioned in 1995 seem more
remote than ever.</soapbox>

	Softdesk was purchased by AutoDesk several years ago.  The last software

	8 of these programs, but it was only an upgrade to be compatible with
	Release 14 of AutoCAD.  I can't find any record in any of my old

	For the latest release of AutoCAD (2000) the HVAC, Plumbing and Piping
	portions of Softdesk were not upgraded, only the Architectural portion.

The frustrating thing for any DOE2 user who's been using the program
since it was CalERDA is that some real progress has
developed over the last few years  with 2.1E, 2.2, and PowerDOE.  Now it
appears that the progress will be put on hold as
we patiently wait several years for EnergyPlus.

The timing is especially bad as more clients who are interested in
"green" design look towards building energy modeling.
Some of the newer, innovated HVAC systems, as well as some popular
systems are not supported in DOE2.x, resulting in
compromising the thoroughness of some modeling assignments.

It's nice to see an open discussion on the state of building simulation
software. It sounds like quite a few people are using DOE2.2 and PowerDOE.
Is DOE2.2 relatively bug free now? Last I heard (several months ago) it was
not quite ready for prime time.

My take on EnergyPlus is that it will offer more flexibility than DOE2
currently does - especially in mechanical systems. Possibly users who do a
lot of DOE2 work might benefit enough from that flexibility to merit the
extra effort required to build their own pre- and post-processors. 

I also understand that they have converted the programming language to an
object-oriented format, and that this might be easier to work with in the
development of custom functions or custom system types. I have spent many
long hours going through DOE2.1E program code trying to make custom
functions work properly. The limited access points for function writing and
the complicated nature of the code has made this process very difficult at
times. 

One thing that is not clear to me yet is whether EnergyPlus will have as
many built-in features as DOE2.2 (such as ground heat pumps and full sets of
default performance curves). 

I have seen a good bit of criticism and doubt about EnergyPlus on these
messages. Are there any EnergyPlus supporters out there? I'd like to hear
both sides.

Also, is DOE2.2 more friendly to function writing than DOE2.1E? What about
DOE2.3?

I'm only a computer science kind of person, with no real in-depth insight
in the underlying problems, but, in your (dear list) opinion, where does the
TRNSYS multizone building model stand in this discussion - developped
by a private company (TRANSSOLAR), with its graphical interface (by
CSTB) and hundreds of users in private industry ?

(And it now also has a cool CAD interface, which is even capable to connect
to AutoCad - http://evl.cstb.fr/iisibat.htm).

Again, this is a naive question, please forgive me. (And yes, I am involved in
TRNSYS developpment and worked on the above-mentioned Cad tool, so
I'm not quite neutral ;-).

Okay, send the flames ...

A couple comments on those of others ... fuel for the fire, or stir up the hornets

Quote: "First let me state that from all available evidence, the whole DOE (and here DOE is the name of the program - what a strange
choice for program name, BTW) effort is one of the most successful undertakings in a brief history of computer program development
and represent well spent government dollars by any standard."

Comment: First, all the contributors to DOE-2 thank you for your kind words.
The name was chosen, against developers advice, by USDOE, shortly after the
creation of the Department, to replace the programs existing name;  previously
the program was named CalERDA for the Calif. and ERDA (one org. moved
into the new DOE) who supplied the early funds.  DOE-1, DOE-2, DOE-2.0A,
DOE-2.1A, DOE-2.1B and DOE-2.1C (1977-1986) were mostly paid for by
DOE with small contributions from others.  DOE-2.1D (~1988) had smallish
percentage of private contribution.  DOE-2.1E (~1994) was about half private
contribution (mostly my company) and DOE-2.2 (current) is mostly private
contribution (mostly my company).  DOE-2 would not have come into existence
without the State and Federal government very large investment; surprisingly large
compared to similar private projects of the time; comparing public vs. private
contributions must be done using project output not $ input.

DOE-X only "took off" after private firms adopted and invested heavily: first
just PC ports like the defunct SI, Inc turned into Acrosoft, and ADM; then our
PC ports with many new HVAC/Economics/EndUseReporting 2.1E versions;
then interfaces Comply24, VisualDOE, EZ-DOE, etc.  This ivestment only happens
if firms can make $ from such efforts.  Such return on investment is not possible
unless licensing gives those investing the time and $ the ability to benefit from their
investment.

So, we owe DOE and CA/CEC thanks for making it possible that DOE-x exists, but
owe the thanks to the private sector companies that took the somewhat deflated
ball, added much air (hot at times) and ran with it.

Quote: "It seems to me that there is a quite a bit of confusion about PowerDOE, which is in my opinion, very good program.  PowerDOE
is nothing more than good pre and post processor, which can have DOE 2.2 or EnergyPlus as underlying engine."

Comment: Again, the PowerDOE development team thanks you for the kind words.
PowerDOE interface code was developed by my company with $ only from EPRI
and our own investment (85% vs. 15%). LBNL participated, with many other
organizations, in design meetings for the PowerDOE user interface. The PowerDOE
interface is not just a "pre and post processor" for DOE-2; it is a full interactive
implementation of DOE-2's BDL processor (which is somewhat of a table driven
table generator whose internal design is only applicable to just DOE-X, but any
application that requires extensive input organized into object tables.)  Editing
PowerDOE data screens is editing BDL memory in real time including the dynamic
recalculation of parameter defaults (like a very large spreadsheet with a formula in
every cell; thus the slow down - geometric- as problems get very large.) The
PowerDOE name was suggested by LBNL as they did not like our original winDOE
name; PowerDOE name was okayed by DOE, then accepted and trademarked by
EPRI (oops! - an poor choice of move motivated by political infighting amoungst the
EPRI/DOE/LBNL/JJH team).  I have licensed the use of the name and EPRI owned
interface code from EPRI for further development and commercial distribution.

Quote: "EnergyPlus is an open source program, and alpha version is just being released.  For measly $100 (I think) anybody can get
license agreement and build commercial strength pre and post-processor to it. "

Comment: EnergyPlus is NOT open source; but it should be, in my opinion, using UC's
(LBNL is managed by UC for DOE) own BSD (Unix) type license since it is developed
(almost?) entirely using public funds.  Why a fee; why not freeware like our basic DOE-2
versions? No published distribution licenses yet; and if these become available and have a
per copy royalty, there can be no freeware products that are EnergyPlus based unless LBNL
does them - in which case why would any private sector firm invest the time and $ to compete
against the government funds.  We could adapt both the PowerDOE and eQUEST (freeware)
interfaces to EnergyPlus in a straight forward manner fairly quickly; we cannot do this without
open source licensing and a working, supported (commercially viable) complete product - a
couple years away at best. I'm sure Eley can do the same with the VisualDOE interface and
EnergySoft with EnergyPro and so on;  DOE has no business funding work that so many
private firms are already doing and can do better; a similar argument can be made for
DOE's getting out of the engine business where the result is in "product" form rather than
NMF model library or "component toolkit" form.  The private sector can take the correct
next commercial product steps, better, cheaper and faster (and also provide the required
product marketing and support.)

Quote: "Sorry for the rant, but I'm also getting tired the people who think they can
purchase Power or Visual DOE and be a DOE2 expert in a week with no prior
experience -- simulation, HVAC design or otherwise."

Comment: we have many eQUEST users after quick, accurate, "first order" answers
doing just what you say is not possible.  But I agree that "specialists" will always be needed
to perform accurate, indepth analysis.  eQUEST 2.0 will be released within a couple weeks
(also freeware - and eQUEST 1.2 will be posted Friday); 2.0 will have a large fraction of
PowerDOE-like capabilities (2D/3D displays, HVAC diagrams, full DOE-2 details dialogs
and data editing, table/graphic report pages) and retains improved versions of the building
creation and EEM wizards.  We want to see thousands doing analysis not hundreds.

Quote: "PowerDoe hasn't been very useful for us.  Our buildings tend to be fairly
large with alot of detail, so it is easy to bring PowerDoe to a crawl on
both the P-pro 200 and PIII 300 machines we have."

Comment:  As I mentioned above, PowerDOE is like a very large spreadsheet with thousands
of formula; changing some items in a large building model causes tens of thousand of parameters
to be recalculated; PowerDOE 1 was developed as a 16-bit application - the memory sharing
between the 16-bit interface code and 32-bit interactive BDL suffers from very large windows
ALIAS-style memory sharing between processes overhead and the slowness of 32-bit numeric
calculation in a 16-bit interface environment.  eQUEST is fully a 32-bit implementation and thus
is much faster; eQUEST 2.0 has full BDL details editing.  Thus, we hope to greatly reduce your
frustrations in the near future.

Quote: "One more comment and question - the DOE is spending our money to create new code and have arguably abandoned the
multi-million dollar investment in previous DOE2.x developent. Is this the best use of taxpayer money?"

Comment: There is an important role, in my view, for taxpayer $ in this field; it is a good way
to get the basic models, algorithms, and lab/field detailed data collection and model validation
started (and sometimes the only source for this funding for some types of components.)  It is
a terrible way to get "products" done; DOE-2 became most successful because private
companies (and utilities) decided to invest heavily in taking the basic code to the next level
so as to be useful and useable by a wide range of "consumers" of the technology (designers,
researchers, code officials, etc.)  This required heavy investment in both the "raw" DOE-2
engine (mostly work done by my company) as well as many interfaces (GabelDodd
EnergySoft's EnergyPro, Eley Associates VisualDOE, Elite's EasyDOE, Item Systems
DOEPlus, EPRI/JJH's PowerDOE, JJH's eQUEST, DOE/PNL ComCheck-Plus, and many
others under development or private offering in specialized markets.)

Quote: "Perhaps my perceptions of success have been unduly tainted by the seemingly endless wait for PowerDOE and 2.2"

Comment: Lots could be said here, but not worth the space.  In summary, others decided to
announce the software development and schedule before the basic components were designed
and cost estimated or funds wre available to do the work.  My company advised against such
announcements and never made any prior to 1997 first versions being available.  No matter,
it is all now out there for you to use; more popwerful but probably new frustrations and
even longer "wish lists."

I used the Meriwether ESAS hourly analysis program from 1977 through 1984
and the DOE-2.1 A through E since 1984 to date. The problem with all the
DOE-2 interfaces is that the user STILL has to understand DOE-2, what it's
keywords are, and what is actually trying to be modeled. Real engineering
and energy dynamics insite must accompany any model effort, to truly
represent what the building is, and what it can become (ECMs).
 
I have been exposed to PowerDOE but don't yet have time to learn the
geometry games it requires up front. PowerDOE will be nice to show a client
the building geometry reproduce from the model input, but I am not in the
pictoral rendering game. Rather, I need to demonstrate to the client the
results of PS-E, how they change per ECM, and the correct dynamics of the
utitliy rates as each ECM changes. Pictures are nice, but pretty pictures of
airplanes doesn't get the airplanes built or off the ground.
 
Another mistake production DOE-2 using companies use is trying to use DOE-2
as a DESIGN program, rathher than an ENERGY ANALYSIS program.  A TRACE or
Carrier E-20 is still far better at assessing exact coil sizes and airflows.
There is not enought SYSTEMS information coming out to make me feel
comfortable in ever using it accurately for design.
 
It really took me 5 - 6 years to REALLY learn what DOE-2 does and doesn't do
(and I STILL forget). And now another program is to be placed upon us
(EnergyPlus) that we will have to learn the idiosyncrasies of.
 
And for the retrofit industry, I STILL gotta match the utitliy meters....

Have you tried the new BLAST user interface? It is so user friendly I
use it in my undergraduate HVAC design class. Students can be a tough
crowd and the user interface makes all the difference. In fact some of
my former students have purchased the package from the University of
Illinois BLAST Support Office and are using it for HVAC system design in
their consulting offices. It seems that EnergyPlus will need an
interface like this before it will have many users.

By the way other faculty, BSO has a great deal on student versions.

A few years ago their was a program called Softdesk Energy 
by Softdesk Inc. that was developed and sold.  It added a 
menu to AutoCad where you could specify weather and 
internal loading, etc., and see monthly energy use results. 
I don't think it is marketed anymore, in fact when you go 
to the www.softdesk.com website you get forwarded to 
Autodesk. No mention of any energy program is on the 
Autodesk web site that I could find.  All I could find was 
on PNL's site since they were one of the developers.

I am also curious on how well this program worked.  Has 
anyone ever used it?

I agree - DOE - what a weird name for a computer program!
Perhaps my perceptions of success have been unduly tainted by the seemingly
endless wait for PowerDOE and 2.2. That,  combined with the evolution of DOE
2.x code, which often seems to be pieces of code randomly stuck together by
engineer-computer geeks (no offense meant to said geeks). I agree that the
DOE2.x program has had a tremendous impact over the last twenty years, and
that it wouldn't have happened without Dept. of Energy support.  I didn't
say the money was - or is - being wasted, only questioned if there are
better ways to spend it. (Indeed, I'd like to see more federal support, but
in perhaps a more open and competitive environment.) Not being a software
developer, I wonder about the trade-offs of evolving existing code vs. major
re-designs.
You are obviously more optimistic than I about the time frame and commercial
interest of EnergyPlus - I guess only time will tell. I'm curious about
peoples' take on the EP Beta licensee - especially from potential
developers. We've debated signing up but are probably going to wait a while.

By the way - it's great to see some interest!

    Let me offer my opinion on this 'controversy'.

    I personally disagree with contentions in this posting that "The history
of DOE and the national labs in creating and releasing such software is not
very good" and that "the DOE is spending our money to create new code and
have arguably abandoned the multi-million dollar investment in previous
DOE2.x development".  First let me state that from all available evidence,
the whole DOE (and here DOE is the name of the program - what a strange
choice for program name, BTW) effort is one of the most successful
undertakings in a brief history of computer program development and
represent well spent government dollars by any standard.  The multitude of
published studies and successful use of the program in commercial world,
including numerous PC implementations and user friendly implementations
(including PowerDOE) clearly proves this point.  Not only was it useful in
U.S., but it is widely used world wide helping achieve better energy
efficiency of buildings in the process.

    As far as I know neither DOE nor EnergyPlus have any planned user
interface (other than arcane input file format).  That is left to commercial
world, including Jeff Hirsch, to put into PowerDOE.  It seems to me that
there is a quite a bit of confusion about PowerDOE, which is in my opinion,
very good program.  PowerDOE is nothing more than good pre and post
processor, which can have DOE 2.2 or EnergyPlus as underlying engine.  Also,
EnergyPlus doesn't mean abandonment of DOE 2 program, it rather builds on
strengths of BLAST and DOE2 programs, and basically streamlines government
money, which was to some extent wasted on the parallel effort to develop two
different programs for the same purpose.

    EnergyPlus is an open source program, and alpha version is just being
released.  For measly $100 (I think) anybody can get license agreement and
build commercial strength pre and post-processor to it.  I believe that many
current developers will use this opportunity and by the time the program is
released (planned for beginning of next year), we will likely have number of
commercial programs that will incorporate user friendly interface.

    This is not the first time that government is accused of "wasting tax
payer dollars" by funding these kind of projects.  Being in the field of
fenestration research, sponsored also by DOE, I heard this kind of argument
all too often from various people.  However, whenever I look back I see
literally tens of billions of dollars saved by having government "push" the
envelope and industry, by spending, oh... maybe $100 million over the past
20 years.  What a return on investment!  I don't have data on the impact
that DOE 2 had in the past 20 years, but I bet that they are not far off.  I
have no doubt in my mind that EnergyPlus is going to continue this path of
excellence.  And I am talking only about dollar savings.  How about improved
quality of lives by having more comfortable homes, and by having less
pollution?

    For those who would like to learn more about EnergyPlus (and other
simulation programs) there is going to be IBPSA meeting and software
demonstration in Dallas in conjunction with ASHRAE meeting on Saturday,
February 5 from 4 to 7 p.m. in Pullman A Room at Hyatt Regency Dallas.  It
is open to anyone.

        Most of you are undoubtedly aware of the recent controversy over
DOE2.2 PowerDoe and EnergyPlus. I know that many people on this list are
actively involved in one or more of these programs.
        I think this list is as good a place as any to start a serious

Let me offer my opinion on this 'controversy'.

I personally disagree with contentions in this posting that "The history of
DOE and the national labs in creating and releasing such software is not
very good" and that "the DOE is spending our money to create new code and
have arguably abandoned the multi-million dollar investment in previous
DOE2.x development".  First let me state that from all available evidence,
the whole DOE (and here DOE is the name of the program - what a strange
choice for program name, BTW) effort is one of the most successful
undertakings in a brief history of computer program development and
represent well spent government dollars by any standard.  The multitude of
published studies and successful use of the program in commercial world,
including numerous PC implementations and user friendly implementations
(including PowerDOE) clearly proves this point.  Not only was it useful in
U.S., but it is widely used world wide helping achieve better energy
efficiency of buildings in the process.

As far as I know neither DOE nor EnergyPlus have any planned user interface
(other than arcane input file format).  That is left to commercial world,
including Jeff Hirsch, to put into PowerDOE.  It seems to me that there is a
quite a bit of confusion about PowerDOE, which is in my opinion, very good
program.  PowerDOE is nothing more than good pre and post processor, which
can have DOE 2.2 or EnergyPlus as underlying engine.  Also, EnergyPlus
doesn't mean abandonment of DOE 2 program, it rather builds on strengths of
BLAST and DOE2 programs, and basically streamlines government money, which
was to some extent wasted on the parallel effort to develop two different
programs for the same purpose.

EnergyPlus is an open source program, and alpha version is just being
released.  For measly $100 (I think) anybody can get license agreement and
build commercial strength pre and post-processor to it.  I believe that many
current developers will use this opportunity and by the time the program is
released (planned for beginning of next year), we will likely have number of
commercial programs that will incorporate user friendly interface.

This is not the first time that government is accused of "wasting tax payer
dollars" by funding these kind of projects.  Being in the field of
fenestration research, sponsored also by DOE, I heard this kind of argument
all too often from various people.  However, whenever I look back I see
literally tens of billions of dollars saved by having government "push" the
envelope and industry, by spending, oh... maybe $100 million over the past
20 years.  What a return on investment!  I don't have data on the impact
that DOE 2 had in the past 20 years, but I bet that they are not far off.  I
have no doubt in my mind that EnergyPlus is going to continue this path of
excellence.  And I am talking only about dollar savings.  How about improved
quality of lives by having more comfortable homes, and by having less
pollution?

For those who would like to learn more about EnergyPlus (and other
simulation programs) there is going to be IBPSA meeting and software
demonstration in Dallas in conjunction with ASHRAE meeting on Saturday,
February 5 from 4 to 7 p.m. in Pullman A Room at Hyatt Regency Dallas.  It
is open to anyone.

Mark,

You've struck a nerve of sorts with your comment of non-modelers or new
modelers using PowerDOE or other graphical interface to do ES work.  These
packages allow for gross error in system simulation when used by the
inexperienced modeler or the office "computer guy" who doesn't have any HVAC
experience.  I get called in to review projects frequently when our clients
are doubting savings that have been submitted.  You would not believe the
mistakes that are made!

Sorry for the rant, but I'm also getting tired the people who think they can
purchase Power or Visual DOE and be a DOE2 expert in a week with no prior
experience -- simulation, HVAC design or otherwise.  I get calls like this
at least once a month on average.  As deregulation looms, the frequency of
this seems to be going up.

My comment on the usefulness of PD was only based on its speed due to the
computation demand the software places on the hardware.  Where we want to
use PD the most is with the 500+ space buildings we need to simulate in 3-D,
with all surfaces defined.  Unfortunately, our current operating budget has
not allowed us to purchase the fastest hardware out there.  This is a
company issue and not a true problem with PD.

Historically, DOE-2 market penetration in Oregon has been excellent.  Most
M/E design firms in Portland have had at one time someone on their staff who
could at least put together a rudimentary model using DOE-2.  This was due
to the $$$ that BPA, PacifiCorp and PGE had available on projects.

Today however, market penetration is weak.  There are really only three
names that come up seriously in the Oregon DOE-2 commercial market: Curtis
Clark, Mike Hatten, and John Karasaki (me).  I don't mean to offend or
forget anyone else in Oregon that may be doing DOE-2 modeling.  I am saying,
however, that if someone wants hard core analysis of complicated mechanical
systems, complex architectural buildings, or analysis of innovative
electrical systems, the three people I mentioned are usually on the top of
the selection list.

Our firm has a high % of using ES in new design.  ES is usually used to help
make major equipment purchasing decisions.  I can't speak about other design
firms, but I'd guess Mike Hatten incorporates ES into his projects since
they do design as well.

Eley and associates market the fact that Visual DOE has the CAD interface
you ask about.  I haven't used it, but others in our firm have with very
limited success.  We have stopped trying to do this and are waiting until
Eley jumps on the DOE-2.2 bandwagon (not that I've heard that they ever
will, though).

P.S.  My understanding is that in Utah, there are really only 2 firms,
including yours, that are doing real ES work.  And that the work done by the
Utah ES people is top drawer.

Best Regards,

John P. Karasaki, P.E.

We've had good luck using both PD and 2.2, often in conjunction. PD can bog
down but with many of our projects it is very useful for showing
non-modelers or new modelers what is happening. Once a PD model is 95-100%
complete we'll start using 2.2 if necessary.


Question: Does anyone know what the `market penetration' energy simulation
(ES)is? What % of design firms use it some of their projects? Most of their
projects? In what % of total new design is ES used? (In Utah it is a very
small fraction indeed!)

Question: Does anyone have much experience with CAD to energy simulation
software? I've heard it exists but frankly have never seen it. Would this
type of interface - say DXF to DOE2.2 or EnergyPlus - have much impact on
market penetration?

Can anyone from DOE or one of the research institutions associated with the
EnergyPlus program explain what their thinking is regarding high quality
user interfaces for the EP simulation code? Is there a plan, beyond hoping
the private market will see enough potential for an interface that they will
create one?

Mark,

I brought this issue up earlier last year and didn't see much dust fly.
Jeff Hirsch was kind enough to post what was going on.

PowerDoe hasn't been very useful for us.  Our buildings tend to be fairly
large with alot of detail, so it is easy to bring PowerDoe to a crawl on
both the P-pro 200 and PIII 300 machines we have.

I'm very happy with what Jeff has done with DOE 2.2 and am even happier that
he is supporting and advancing it.  I don't think DOE would be able to do as
good a job as Jeff has done.  They tend to take on too large chunks at a
time and complicate things.

It would be nice if DOE provided grants or other funding for private
developers to continue work on DOE 2.2.  However, I don't see this is
plausible since they have spent thousands (millions?) on EnergyPlus already.
I don't think it's likely that anything which competes with EnergyPlus will
see any government funding.  And even though I'm typically an optimist, I
don't think that even a letter from everyone on this list, or every DOE2
user in the world would change their minds and direction.  Hopefully, I'll
be proven wrong.

I must confess I have no experience with TRNSYS. But I also don't seem to
see anywhere near as many references to it in the literature as I do for
DOE2.x. Is this a product of market penetration or a bias that DOE2.x is
used more for research and is therefor referenced in open publications more
often?

I'm only a computer science kind of person, with no real in-depth insight
in the underlying problems, but, in your opinion, where does the
TRNSYS multizone building model stand in this discussion - developped
by a private company, with its graphical interface (also developped by
a private company) and hundreds of users in private industry ?
Again, this is a naive question, please forgive me. (And yes, I am involved
in
TRNSYS developpment and biased).

I wonder if I could dare to send this to the list ... maybe not :-)

Most of you are undoubtedly aware of the recent controversy over DOE2.2
PowerDoe and EnergyPlus. I know that many people on this list are actively
involved in one or more of these programs.
I think this list is as good a place as any to start a serious discussion
about where things are going, why, and how we (users of the tools) feel
about these things.

I'll start by boldly stating that I don't believe EnergyPlus will provide a
truly useful (on-the-ground useful) tool for many years to come. The history
of DOE and the national labs in creating and releasing such software is not
very good.
Are the labs and developers trying to create a product useable in a
competitive design consulting world? The last thing we need is another
arcane simulation package with no front end or post processor - been there,
done that. Perhaps new algorithyms and advanced coding are needed but
without the interface they won't help me at all. I'd rather use the `older'
ones and keep the ability to show designers what I'm doing.

One more comment and question - the DOE is spending our money to create new
code and have arguably abandoned the multi-million dollar investment in
previous DOE2.x developent. Is this the best use of taxpayer money?

Come on everybody - don't be afraid to weigh-in on this - let's hear your
thoughts!

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200001251329.AA295982MD05290@gard.com>

Greetings:

I have had several questions regarding the ibpsa-usa expo and dinner at
Dallas.

Both events are open to anyone, not just ibpsa members.  In fact, we would
like to broaden the participation.  If you have some software to exhibit,
or want to attend the dinner, please contact me (cpederse at uiuce.edu).
Everyone exhibiting software will be charged the cost of one dinner, but
will get a free dinner ticket in exchange.

There has been a small change in arrangements.  Both events will be in the
Pullman room, the expo in Pullman A and the dinner in Pullman B.  A cash
bar will be available.

Revised details:

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] refrigeration modeling (PowerDOE)
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200001241629.AA290771MD04995@gard.com>

Hi,
hopefully this question will be a little more challenging than the one I sent about electric meters - I figured out the answer to that one about 2 minutes after sending the question. 

I am trying to model supermarket refrigeration.
The store has three separate compressor rack systems, and 4 packaged single zone units.  I am planning to assign one compressor rack to each of three of the four PSZ units.  Two of the rack systems have multiple suction temperatures, so I will specify the evaporator capacity and EER at each temperature.  

The area that I need a little assistance with is the performance curves.  Does PowerDOE assume that the compressors' kW is the evaporator capacity divided by the EER?  Does it then multiply this kW by the output of the curve fits for compressor kW as a function of condensing temperature and part load ratio?  What factors determine part load ratio for the compressors?

How do you specify interaction between the refrigeration cases and the conditioned space in the store?  (The cooling effect that the cases have in the space, and the effect of space humidity and temperature on the case load)  

Thanks
Alec

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Open source building energy simulation program
References: <MDAEMON-F200001201045.AA454918MD81508@gard.com>
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200001240208.AA081167MD04796@gard.com>

I do not know of a comprehensive building simulation package that
is available under "open source" licensing, but I think it is a good idea.

My company has discussing this issue internally and think that it
would be in both the industry's and public's interest for energy
simulation engines to be open source. I believe such a move,
industry wide, will foster further use of these programs as
well as encourage wider development of such software; both
these results will, I believe, lead to better building energy modeling
tools that are more widely used throughout the buildings industry.

Open source, however, seems only half of a solution. Open source,
for example, does not directly benefit end users.  So additionally,
freeware executables of basic building energy simulation products
should be made available. The combination of open source and
freeware executables is in the best interests of the user community
and thus energy efficient building design.

To this end, last year I began releasing my company's versions of
eQUEST and "raw" JJHirsch PC DOE-2 versions as freeware,
including source for the calculation portions of the energy simulation
engine. I would like to know if the user and developer communities
think open source licensing should also be made available.

"Open source" for me means licensing along the lines of the GNU,
Mozilla, or similar licenses posted at www.opensource.org  These
licenses were devised to make sure future source enhancements
continue to benefit the entire user/developer community while
protecting the originator(s) copyright. These licenses do not impair
anyone's ability to perform private research or undertake private
development using the source. Charles Eley's point is these licenses
allow commercial distribution with restrictions. I believe, however,
that the commercial or for-profit distribution of privately funded
software can be easily addressed by the originator(s) placing options
into the open source license that facilitates distribution of derivative
and bundled works; such licensing can help supply the funds required
to accomplish open source publishing. For works originated with public
funds the BSD and MIT licenses are a more correct and widely
accepted choice for open source publishing and do not contain
the commercial distribution restrictions.

I'm sure there are pro's and con's to these ideas for the range of
developers and users of the various packages out there.  I'm
interested in hearing those varying views discussed openly.

I would like to develop a plan on how to proceed with this idea and
apply it to the open source and freeware release, as well as continued
maintenance, of the DOE-2 energy simulation engine.

I welcome comments and look forward to your ideas.

Jason,

Open Source has licensing restrictions. The main restriction is that
any enhancements, additions or modifications to the code have to 
be offered on the same licensing terms as the original code. This
prevents proprietary branches.  

Open source is a terrific model for the development of tools like
EnergyPlus that enjoy significant public investment.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200001211144.AA443270MD04344@gard.com>

I am working on a PowerDOE model of a strip mall with 10 tenants.  I have assigned electric meters of type "building" to each HVAC zone and system in each of the tenant spaces.  I also have one master meter of type "utility".  The simulation won't run because of an error - the building meters are not attached to the utility meter.  However, I can't find a screen in the "attachments" section that allows me to do this.  Does anyone have a (simple, I hope) solution?

Thanks

Does anyone know how to distinguish between a rack of scroll compressors and a rack of semi-hermetic recip. compressors?  I assume that you have to change the curve fit coefficients for the two compressor kW curves.  Are the default curve fits from the library for any particular kind of equipment?
