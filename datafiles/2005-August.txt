Subject: [bldg-sim] Inconsistencies between DOE2.1E Reports PS-B and BEPU
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200508311325.AA2518390pd80000774712@gard.com>

Greetings,
 
I am running a building simulation using DOE2.1E. I have come across a
situation where the total energy consumption reported for the year in the
PS-B report does not agree with that reported in the BEPU report or PS-E
report for that matter (the BEPU and PS-E reports agree). I am trying to
figure out if there is some other additional item that is reported on in the
PS-B report that is not reported on in the others or vice-versa. 
 
Has anyone ever encountered a similar situation? Would you know what the
cause might be? Any enlightenment on the issue would be greatly appreciated.
 
Thanks,

As an aside to what Jeff Hirsch has said about this subject.

I have had good success creating an hourly schedule (8760 individual
hours) of type multiplier that can be used to adjust a process load at
the zone level to account for the effect of an ERV on a fan coil, heat
pump or other zone based system.  Using schedule type multiplier allows
you to adjust for both heating and cooling.  

It takes a little work.  The steps involved are: 1. export the necessary
variables via an hourly report 2. import them into Excel or other
spreadsheet, 3. do the necessary calculation, 4. normalize the results
to the largest value 5. write VBA macros (or do it by hand - Yikes!!.)
to do most of the work creating the hourly schedule of normalized
values, 6. past the schedule into the DOE2.2 input file, 7. use the
largest value as the actual process load and assign the hourly schedule
to adjust the load.  The hardest part is making sure that the schedule
you create matches the calendar year you are simulating. 

I don't know if you could figure out a way to do this for a dedicated
outside air system. It may work if you assign the hourly process load to
the dummy zone served by the dedicated OA system.  The OA passed to the
referenced system might pick up the load.  

If you are careful to account for the various interactions and use a
good calculation methodology you should get a reliable answer.       

Good luck,

Mike

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200508261512.AA1233703pd80000770336@gard.com>

This discussion is relative to current versions of DOE-2.1E and
DOE-2.2 that we know of and/or currently distribute.  Older
out-of-date versions may not have all features discussed here.

No version of DOE-2 that we distribute, or know about, has
heat recovery equipment "built it" as an option for fan coil systems;
the 2.1E RECOV-MODE and 2.2 ERV keywords are "unused" for
those system types.

In 2.2 it is possible, using expressions, to override this and force the
FC system to use the ERV model; this is not recommended to do since
the ERV keywords and variables are "system" level variables and
the FC system is a "zonal" system; for a single zone per FC system this
may work (I'm not sure as I have not tried) but you would need to
carefully examine the source (in the DOE-2.2 release .zip archive) and
hourly output to ensure it is working correctly.

In 2.1E you can also override this unused set of keywords with a set
of "FUNCTION" commands, however, you would need to implement the
heat recovery algorithms into the fancoil subroutine (FCOIL) at FUNCTION
point FCOIL-1Z as fan coil systems do not allow economizers (unlike 2.2,
which allows economizers, DCV and cycling FC fans with zone load)
thus that routine does no call the ECONO routine (where the recovery
keywords are used) when establishing the supply air temperature.

But the question was really on recovery for systems that are set up as
OA supply systems so that defined FC systems can reference them using
the OA-FROM keyword.

In general, no version of DOE-2 that we have or know of can correctly
model OA supply systems with energy recovery systems.  This is due to
the lack of iteration between the OA supply system and the systems that
are supplied the treated OA.  The return air conditions for the OA supply
system do not reflect the return air conditions from the systems that are
supplied the OA; thus the recovery system acts on the return air conditions
of the OA supply system without including the effects of the other AHU's
and their zones.  If the OA supply system only has a small fraction of its
air going to the other AHU's then the results may be close (but not correct);
but usually (and what the DOE-2 OA-FROM keyword is commonly used
to model) the OA system supplies 100% of its air to the other AHU's and
the calculated return conditions for the OA supply system (on which the
recovery algorithms act) is the OA system supply conditions not the common
return from all the supplied AHU's ... the resultant recovery calculation
and thus OA system load are incorrect (thus the effect of the recovery system
will not be correctly reflected into the results.)

The OA-FROM DOE-2 keyword can do a good job of modeling an OA treatment
system when that system is 100% OA, the treated OA air is supplied at constant
volume flow directly to other AHU's, and the OA system is controlled to supply
OA at a constant, scheduled (OA temp reset or not) or floating (based on the OA
system capacity being low or the OA into the unit being within the controller
setpoint range) temperature to the AHU's.

If the OA system is VAV,  OA system or AHU's have movable OA dampers, the OA
system has zone controlled supply temperature, or either the OA system or AHU's
cycle on independent controllers, then the DOE-2 simulation is not reliable ... it can be
done, but very careful input and examination of output is required to get a result
and determine if it is correct.

In 2.1E there is no correct sizing of OA supply system or error checking on any
incorrect input for these systems; 2.2 has sizing of these systems and a lot of
error checking ... please see the latest Vol 6 Manual (new features) for more
information.

2.1E assumes the supplied AHU systems OA fraction is to equal the OA-FROM
systems OA amount; thus making is not usually possible to supply more than one
AHU with an OA supply system.  2.2 has not such limit; it can correctly model
an OA supply system that supplies any number of other AHUs with each AHU
OA flow being able to be set independently (via input or default OA requirements
specified for that AHU)

Both 2.1E and 2.2 require the OA system to be defined in the BDL input file prior to
any AHU it supplies; 2.2 issues an error if this is not found to be true while
2.1E issues no errors on any incorrect OA-FROM input, including many
types of errors that produce completely incorrect results ... it just performs an
incorrect simulation.  2.2 has many error messages about many aspects of OA
supply systems, and does not allow a completely invalid simulation to be performed.

Hello,

I'm  simulating commercial and residential buildings prototypes with 
eQUEST to aid in developing city wide building energy consumption 
profiles.  I'm looking for input files (DOE-2) or hourly simulation 
results (with detailed building descriptions) that have been calibrated 
to measured data (Similar to those used to find end use or component 
loads reported by EIA).  Are these kinds of computer files/data available?

  Suneel,
  As far as I know, you cannot model stratification in eQUEST. There is a workaround with modelling underfloor systems (Dan Nall & Marlin Addison have done some work in this area - check the link here, or just google their names)

  http://www.doe2.com/Download/Docs/Addison-Nall_UnderfloorAirDistPaper_Rev1.pdf

  I am not sure that this is what you are looking for though. If you are modelling only stratification, you probably want to use CFD.

  I am not familiar with Energy Plus, so I dont know if it does stratification modelling, but that might be an option thats cheaper than cfd.

I am using DOE2.1E to model a typical four pipe fan coil system.  Fresh air 
is by a make-up air system ducted to near each fan coil.  Relief air is 
exhausted through an enthalpy reclaim system coupled with the fresh air 
supply fan.  DOE2.1E does not model this arrangement.  Can I do it with 
Equest (DOE2.2) using the OA-FROM-SYSTEM facility.  Thanks for your help.

The recent messages with subject "failed" or "report" sent 
to the BLDG-SIM mailing list were spoofed (faked) to look 
like it came from the postmaster here at GARD. The messages 
did not come from us and no ones account has been 
suspended.

Also, no one needs to worry about those messages since the 
mailing list software removed the attachment before it was 
distributed. 

In the past, attachments were removed before messages were 
sent to the list but now I will block messages with 
attachments and notify the sender.  I have also added 
another filter to try to prevent this type spoofing in the 
future.  

Thanks for your patience.

This version is working correctly.  I had created a window in previous 
Window 5 version - the Uvalue reported in the DOE2.1E sim file was 
incorrect.  I created the same window in this updated version and the 
Uvalue reported in the DOE2.1E sim file is correct.

Thanks for your good work!

In-Reply-To: <MDAEMON-F200508151110.AA1033562pd80000905409@gard.com>
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200508160809.AA0946515pd80000760098@gard.com>

Good morning Brian-

This may or may not help but here is how we have interpreted the standard:

In ASHRAE 90.1-1999, each chapter has a *.2 section which is the mandatory
provision (i.e. 5.2, 6.2, 7.2, 8.2, 9.2, 10.2) and is not available for
tradeoff in the ECB method.

Likewise, the *.3 sections are the prescriptive paths for compliance
available for tradeoff, but only seen in chapters 5, 6, 7 and 9.  They don't
exist for chapters 8 or 10.  Two of these sections (5.3 and 6.3) are not
specifically labeled "prescriptive" in the ECB text of ASHRAE 90.1-199, but
they are addressed.  For instance, section 5.3 is the reference in Section
11.4.2 (a) that determines the minimum U-factors for the budget building -
the prescriptive path for building envelopes although not explicitly stated
as such in chapter 11.

Section 6.3 is referenced in 11.4.3 (d, e, f, and i) as well as Notes 1, 2,
4, 5, and 6 for Table 11.4.3A.  These sections cover at least half of the
prescriptive path for the HVAC systems.  If half of them are referenced, we
automatically follow the other half when those components are in the
building.

The 7.3 prescriptive path for water heating that also includes space heating
is very rarely implemented in the type of projects that we work on and
really only states the conditions that are appropriate for use of a space
and water heating combo unit.

Section 9.3 isn't specifically mentioned in the ECB method text.  However,
since the 9.2 mandatory provisions do not address maximum lighting power
density allowed, we HAVE to go to 9.3 if we want to take an energy credit
for reduced lighting power density.

As energy modelers, I think we tend to automatically and indirectly use the
prescriptive paths, sometimes without realizing it, in order to get credit
for ALL the energy efficiency measures in any building we are working on.

I hope this helps clarify things.  Have a nice day.

  The 90.1 rules provide explicit guidance on modeling by modifying the
proposed design per the rules in the ECBM and exclude anything not
explicitly in those rules.



  According to the 90.1-1999 User's Manual, but not obviously in the text of
ASHRAE 90.1-1999, it is also necessary to add to the baseline all
prescriptive path features not modeled in the proposed design and not
spelled out in the Budget Building rules in 90.1-1999. .



  Am I overlooking something in the text of ASHRAE 90.1-1999, or is this
requirement only in the narrative introduction of the ECBM section of the
90.1-1999 User's Manual?



  I also don't see this requirement explicitly in the ASHRAE 90.1-2004 text
on the ECBM.



  Any thoughts?

I am trying to model baseboard heating in VAV with reheat system. I have
auto size selected for my heating system. I have thermostatic control
for baseboard heating. 

Without baseboard heating selected; my system meets zone heating
requirements and system not met% is 2.9%

When baseboard heating is selected; system not met% jumps to 102%. Total
sum of baseboard heating btu/hr and new system btu/hr does not add up to
match initial system size.

Do the above results make sense? Can someone give me any pointers? 

Thanks,

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] ASHRAE 90.1 and Energy Cost Budget Method budget building
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200508151110.AA1020921pd80000759227@gard.com>

The 90.1 rules provide explicit guidance on modeling by modifying the
proposed design per the rules in the ECBM and exclude anything not
explicitly in those rules.

 

According to the 90.1-1999 User's Manual, but not obviously in the text of
ASHRAE 90.1-1999, it is also necessary to add to the baseline all
prescriptive path features not modeled in the proposed design and not
spelled out in the Budget Building rules in 90.1-1999. .  

 

Am I overlooking something in the text of ASHRAE 90.1-1999, or is this
requirement only in the narrative introduction of the ECBM section of the
90.1-1999 User's Manual?

 

I also don't see this requirement explicitly in the ASHRAE 90.1-2004 text on
the ECBM. 

 

Any thoughts?

Is the only way to control room pressurization in eQuest through specifying

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] water to water heat pump--chilled water for cooling on one side, DHW on the other
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200508110955.AA5525359pd80000756154@gard.com>

I am trying to model in eQuest detailed edit mode a water to water heat pump
that serves domestic water heating, and on the other side provides cooling
to a make-up water system.  When there is no demand for make-up cooling, the
WWHP will use a ground water well source, or condenser water from other WSHP
or chiller equipment. It doesn't seem possible to connect a DHW loop as a
secondary loop to another primary loop in DOE 2.2. 

 

One solution is to model the cooling of the make-up with a separate WWHP,
approximate DHW with air source heat pump,  and use hourly reports to
capture the savings for when heat is provided from the make-up cooling
process. 

 

Any ideas on another way to manage this within the commands of DOE-2 with
less post-processing?  The post-processing requires separate LEED
documentation with an Exceptional Calculation.

Call for Symposium Papers on Measured Energy Performance of Low-Energy
Buildings

ASHRAE TC 2.8 is sponsoring a series of symposiums entitled 'How Low Can
You Go? Low-Energy Buildings through Integrated Design'. With recent
interest in green buildings, a number of buildings designed to save
significant amounts of energy have now been constructed. But do we know how
these buildings are operating? This symposium will bring together case
studies of low-energy, sustainability, and integrated design in residential
and commercial buildings. Topics include evaluation of individual
technologies, design process, lessons learned, and long-term MEASURED
energy performance.

The first symposium (cosponsored with TCs 7.1, 7.6, and 4.7) is planned for
the 2006 ASHRAE Winter meeting in Chicago. TC 2.8 is now looking for
symposium papers on low-energy buildings for the June 2006 ASHRAE Annual
meeting in Quebec City (and subsequent meetings). Each case study must
include information comparing building energy design goals with at least
one year of measured energy data-utility bills or sub-metering.

Draft papers for the Quebec City meeting are due for review in September
2005 (all papers will be reviewed through ASHRAE Manuscript Central). If
you are interested or plan to submit a paper, please send a title,
abstract, and list of authors as soon as possible to the symposium chair,
Dru Crawley (drury.crawley at ee.doe.gov).

Peter:

I'm guessing you aren't allowing the VAV system
chilled water coil to modulate, but just remain fixed
at 55 DegF. I believe there is a WARMEST keyword for
COOL-CONTROL. Use that, and the heating energy should
drop.

I'm modeling and Variable Air Volume (VAVS in DOE 2) system two ways.
Without reheat with baseboard heat, and another with reheat and with
baseboard heat.  

Both systems results in very high space heating energy (60 - 70% of all
building energy use).  

Any ideas what may cause that?

If you are above 3.4 Btu/h-ft2 then you are probably still 
going to be below the semi-heating requirements 15 to 20 
Btu/h-ft2 (depending on where in Iowa) from the definition 
of "space" in section 3.2. Those have lower insulation 
requirements then normal spaces but you still have to meet 
the mechanical and lighting requirements (0.3 W/sqft 
lighting).

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200508030953.AA5348734pd80000749009@gard.com>

Can anyone help me understand how Equest determines the required
heating/cooling capacity of a loop?  I've set all of the "size ratio"
settings to 1 and it still appears that the loop capacity is much higher
than required to meet the building peak load.  For example, on report
PS-D it lists a peak load of around 1090 Kbtuh for the chilled water
loop, but then on report PV-A it gives a loop cooling capacity of about
1760 Kbtuh.  If I look at the loading reports for that loop, I'm never
above 60 loaded, indicating to me that the loop is oversized.  Is Equest
sizing the loop to meet the sum of the coil peak loads rather than the
total building peak load?  

I'm new to Equest so it may be something obvious that I'm overlooking,
I'd appreciate any help that anyone could offer.

Thanks,
Dustin
