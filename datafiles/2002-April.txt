I don't know anything about eQuest. We utilise TAS and it is successful in modelling buildings without HVAC, with full HVAC or even with "fan-only" HVAC.

I would like to use eQUEST to simulate buildings that do not have any HVAC 
equipment and that will be naturally ventilated.  I am interested in getting 
hourly temperature of different locations within the buildings.  I would like 
to get some advice and guidance on how to do this?  Thanks in advance for any

I still run the original DOE-2.1E, but eQuest is DOE-2.2. So, as if to
satisfy government bill collection computers by writing a check for $0.00,
try modeling the building that has a fan with zero (or virtually zero)
airflow and kW in the fan ?

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200204170746.AA460829pd80000140034@gard.com>

I work for the Civil Engineering Department of the Catholic University of Chile. At this very moment I am studying the energy performance for residential projects in order to modify the present laws that rule in my country. To do my research I am using PowerDOE as a energy simulation tool, but unfortunately I don't have any chilean weather file to use with this software.

Has anyone had PowerDOE experience using ASHRAE international weather data which they offer
on the "Internation Weather for Energy Calculations" CD? Do those files have a good correlation results with the real local data?

Any observations would be greatly appreciated. 
Thanks

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200204161427.AA270351pd80000139714@gard.com>

Hello,
Has anyone had PowerDOE experience modeling VFDs on hot water pumps with two-way valves on the coils vs.constant speed pumps and three way valves?  

We have tried this measure on more than one model and get a strange result.  With the VFDs, the pump electric energy decreases as expected, but there is a substantial penalty in fuel use for heating which we cannot explain.  The fuel penalty is much greater than what you could attribute to the energy that a constant speed pump would be adding to the fluid.

Has anyone else had this result, and does anyone have any suggestions?  Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks.

Sincerely,

Alec Stevens

p.s. I got a voicemail from someone in the group the other day about refrigeration modeling.  The voicemail got garbled and I didn't catch all the contact info.  I believe the name of the person who called me was David Civic.  David, if you could please get in touch with me via email, I'll try to give some assistance, but it has been a while since I've modeled any supermarkets.  

The question was:  How does DOE take into account the space load on refrigeration casework?  If anyone else has suggestions on this, maybe they can post info to the group.

Thanks!

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200204151257.AA572159pd80000139311@gard.com>

I am simulating a supermarket in DOE2.1e with a desiccant dehumidification
and am using the add-on desiccant keywords.

What I am not clear on is how the operation of the humidification system is
controlled. The DOE 2.1e supplement reads that, in control mode 0, "the
desiccant wheel is cycled on and off during the hour to control the removal
of the latent loads".  Is the max-humidity keyword required to determine the
level of dehumidification required?  Or, does max humidity only act on the
cooling control?

DESICCANT  SOL-VENT-AIR-1
DESC-CTRL-MODE =  0

Any observations / experiences would be greatly appreciated.

Drury and Jason are correct; this is a DOE-2 bug (all versions) that does not allow the program to simulate latitudes at or above the arctic circle (also true in the Southern hemisphere). Drury's suggestion should allow you to get around the problem.

DOE-2.2, Version 41 and later fixes this problem. The program now also recognizes that sun angles can change radically from one month to the next in high latitudes (especially spring/fall, even in more temperate latitudes), and will recalculate shading angles more often than once per month when it encounters this situation.  Users of DOE-2.2 should download Version 41a from the FTP site. 

eQUEST is expected will contain this fix sometime this quarter. We are considering porting this fix into DOE-2.1e as well, but have not yet done so.

  Barrow, Alaska is above the arctic circle so (many? all?)

Thanks Everyone,

I'm using LBNL's DOE2.1E v-114, and it seems that even if the LATITUDE is
specified in the input file, the program reverts to the one in the weather
file if the two numbers don't match.

I unpacked the weather file changed the LATITUDE to 66.5 (maximum allowed by
DOE-2), and packed it again. It seems to work OK now.

Barrow, Alaska is above the arctic circle so (many? all?)
DOE-2.1e versions will crash.  It is a bug that has been
around a while.

Have you tried the DOE2.com website?  I just ran the DOE-2.2 example SM-OFF.INP with the TMY2 barrowak.bin weather off this site, and it ran fine.

  Has anyone successfully used the  Barrow, Alaska TMY2 weather file for DOE-2 simulations? I've tried using the file from a couple of different sources, and the file appears to be corrupt everywhere. It crashes the simulation after BDL. 

  Does anyone have another DOE-2 weather file for Barrow, Alaska? 

  Thanks,


  Tanmay Tathagat

Dear Sr or Madam: 

My name is Mart?n Ordenes and I work for the Civil Engineering Department of the Catholic University of Chile. At this very moment I'm trying to create some chilean weather files but I don't have all the information I need. 

I just have hourly data of Horizontal Global radiation and I would be very grateful if you could send me some information about any equation or coefficient that would allow me to estimate the Horizontal solar radiation and Direct (beam) solar radiation. 

  I look forward to hearing from you. 
  Sincerely yours.
