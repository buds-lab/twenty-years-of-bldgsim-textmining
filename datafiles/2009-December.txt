Good morning everyone.

 

If you know of any existing commercial end use data studies for Maryland - public or private - could you please let me know where I might find that, or who I could contact to ask about it?  I'm primarily interested in commercial end use data, but residential is of interest as well.  I know that CBECS is available for the region, but probably not very representative of Maryland because of the large region it's grouped with, so I am looking for more detailed data.

 

Thanks in advance for any info!

 

Regards, 

 

Bob

Bob,
 
You can usually find state specific info at: http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/state/index.cfm
If not, my guess would be you contact the Maryland State Energy Office/Energy Admin Office.

Message-ID: <929B6033B7774E49BD7600B3F83E88BD9F864A@HMP107.hilson_moran.local>

Afternoon all,
 
We're trying to obtain the minimum CoP for a Packaged Terminal Heat Pump
in cooling mode for a new construction using table 6.8.1D in ASHRAE
90.1-2004 (SI edition) and the formula is proving to be somewhat
confusing. In the SI edition it is described as 
 
[3.60 - (0.213 x Cap/1000)]
 
Is this the same equation as listed in the imperial edition of
90.1-2004? If the max. unit capacity of 4.4kW is converted to Btu/hr
(approx 15024 Btu/hr, as per note c) and input to the formula, the
minimum CoP is only 0.4, which seems very low. However, if I use the
value in Watts in the equation, the minimum CoP comes out as a much more
reasonable 2.66. 
 
I can't seem to find any addenda on ASHRAE's website or additional
guidance on this matter and would very much appreciate any guidance you
can provide.
 
Many thanks for your help.

Dan.

Hello Dan,

You are correct to use Watts for the SI equation.  The counterpart equation for the PTHP (cooling mode, new construction) in the IP version is [12.3 - (0.213 x Cap/1000)], but is expressed as EER (not COP.)  COP's are expressed for heating mode as [3.2 - (0.026 x Cap/1000)].  That lower coefficient (0.026) softens the Cap/1000 value, when Cap is in Btu/h.

In some cases it may be counter productive to use a high emissivity 
roof.  I have worked on uncooled warehouses where the team used an 
approved roofing product to get that point but the heating energy 
increased enough to lower the savings enough to lose an EAc1 point.

Chris makes a good point to consider with cool roofs.

A cool roof will indeed reduce solar heat gain to the roof which reduces its
temp (good in summer) and reduces cooling requirements in summer but will
increase heating requirements in the winter.

Until someone develops a material where the emissivity changes with
temperature (and not just wavelength) a cool roof that is good in summer
will be bad in winter.

So, in colder climates, a cool roof can indeed increase the overall energy
use of a building.

Even so, some northern cities like Chicago, mandate cool roofs in building
code.  Why?  Because the cool roof will reduce the urban heat island effect
where the city has increased temperatures compared to the surrounding
areas.

The thought is that the overall benefits of the  reduction in urban heat
island effect in summer is more important than the increased energy use that
comes from increased winter cooling load.

Dear Sir,
                 I was modelling a building located in Cochin in India
but weather file is not available for this city can i consider weather
file of Trivandrum which is near to Cochin .Else if there is some
other option please suggest me.

Thanks

Of course, if your roof is well insulated, it will be covered with snow. I
doubt very much that your ?warm? roof will really help much. Go with the
cool roof.

I'll add some general info to the discussion and do a little summing up.
 
LBL has studied emissivity and reflectance and has annual energy impact
results for hot and cold climates:
http://eetd.lbl.gov/HeatIsland/CoolRoofs/HeatTransfer/Heating.html
 
The Heat Island Group has a lot of information available pertinent to
the emissivity discussion:
http://eetd.lbl.gov/HeatIsland/
 
We've been focusing on roofs, but window design also has to consider the
same effects. For glazing, we add the property of transmissivity
(radiation passing through the surface) and we have to get more specific
about the types of radiation (solar, visible, UV, infrared) and the
direction (outside vs. inside, as well as angle of incidence).
http://www.commercialwindows.umn.edu/issues_energy1.php
 
For opaque building surfaces, such as roofs, walls and window frames, it
is understood that unless stated otherwise:
Reflectivity and absorptivity values are for solar radiation.
Emissivity values are for thermal/far-infrared radiation.
 
1 - reflectivity = absorptivity
 
So when ASHRAE 90.1 Table G3.1 requires you to model a roof reflectivity
of 0.30, you can use an absorptance of 0.70 (such as when modeling in
eQUEST).
 
While there are technical distinctions, the following terms are
generally used interchangeably:
Reflectance/reflectivity
Absorptance/absorptivity
Emittance/emissivity

Another point to consider is that ambient temperature affects HVAC system
performance. If you?ve got rooftop mounted condensers, they?ll operate much
better on a ?cool? roof.

Not sure how you?d model that effect.

Well, I?m going over a year back into the archives, but hopefully someone can help.  I?m modeling a project with 500 Ton Carrier Evergreen Water-Cooled Screw Chillers and would like to take advantage of the part-load efficiency benefits.  It appears that Dan Nall posted custom efficiency curves for this specific equipment a while back, but when I use them in eQUEST my cooling energy gets tripled (from 800 MWh to 2450 MWh) as compared to the default eQUEST curves for Water-cooled Screw chillers.  Does anyone have experience using these curves effectively?  Am I misinterpreting the curve data?  Are they intended for something other than eQUEST inputs?  Or are the default eQUEST curves unrealistically efficient?

Does anyone have DOE-2 performance curves for a variable speed screw chiller (I believe the Carrier Evergreen 23XRV is the only one now) that they would be willing to share?

Thanks in advance.

You may want to run an eQuest report on the chiller to see how the efficiency is varying throughout the year.  Output the load and the power at each hour and you should get a better idea of whether the curves are working or not, or if the default curves are reasonable for your specific equipment.

True indeed.

Except when your roofs are not covered with snow.

Here in Chicago, at least the past few years,  snow has come in bigger
chunks with more warmi and cold periods in between.  And rooftop snow has
been melting during the warm periods so  rooftops have been bare for more of
the winter.

It would be an interesting study (maybe I can find an undergrad or
interested masters student) to actually look at a typical flat roof small
commercial building and see if the increased summer efficiency of cooling
equipment from a cool roof offsets the increased winter heating load.

If you want to take credit for a specific variable speed chiller I would 
recommend working with the manufacturer to get you specific part-load data 
and at varying LIFT DT?s.  Anything simpler would be both inaccurate and 
likely selling yourself short.

Does anyone have DOE-2 performance curves for a variable speed screw chiller

be willing to share?



Thanks in advance.

Message-ID: <99a1215d0912021050i1c689a35j24290c6dad27cc4e@mail.gmail.com>

All,

I am modeling an existing commercial building in eQuest with HVAC provided
by RTUs.  When considering retrofit options we are considering providing
demand control ventilation, and thus keeping the amount of outside air to
the minimum required.  Is it reasonable to consider switching fan operation
to intermittent for this building (ie only run fans when necessary for
ventilation and/or cooling)?  Does anyone know if it is even possible to
purchase RTUs that could be controlled to not run indoor fans continuously?


Thanks,
Erik Greensfelder

Message-ID: <7F3D10949562FE448CAE07E975846906313A34@AESVR01.ambient-e.local>

I am working on a LEED energy model for a small <5000sf project that has
a hot water loop served by a campus district steam loop.  I am trying to
follow the "Required treatment of District Thermal Energy in LEED NC2.2"
rules, but am unclear of the requirements it is asking for.  I
understand the requirements for the proposed Step 1 and Step 2, but the
baseline requirements seem quite unclear to me.

 

This building falls in the System 3: PSZ-AC with Fossil Fuel Furnace
heating type.  

 

My understanding of the requirements are as follows:

- Step 1 baseline: because it is supposed to be cost neutral, I model
the systems with a hot water loop and coils served by purchased steam
rather than the normal 90.1 System 3- fossil fuel furnace.

-Step 2 Baseline (this is where I am more unclear):  

Option 1: model this exactly as described in App G, system 3: with a
fossil fuel furnace with 90.1 efficiency (i.e. no hot water loop and
coils, and no steam boiler).  

Option 2: model this with the hot water loop and coils as in step 1, and
put in a hot water boiler with the efficiencies listed in 90.1?

Option 3: model this with the hot water loop and coils as in step 1, and
put in a steam boiler with the efficiencies listed in 90.1?

 

 

Please let me know if I am understanding step 1 correctly and which
option should be followed for step 2.

Thank you for your help.

I'm starting a new "thread" as this is a definite tangent from the
emissivity discussion of the past few days.

 

A question occurred to me on reading Ralph / Chris's comments below...
does ANY energy modeling program/engine today use the snow cover data
present in TMY2 files?  There's obvious implications for things like
roof surface thermal behavior and hourly photovoltaic array performance
when you consider the reality of significant snow cover presence through
the day...

 

Of note... I'm no expert, but for others' reference I found a nice
resource this afternoon clarifying the what/why/how of TMY files here:

True indeed.

Except when your roofs are not covered with snow.

Here in Chicago, at least the past few years,  snow has come in bigger
chunks with more warmi and cold periods in between.  And rooftop snow
has been melting during the warm periods so  rooftops have been bare for
more of the winter.

It would be an interesting study (maybe I can find an undergrad or
interested masters student) to actually look at a typical flat roof
small commercial building and see if the increased summer efficiency of
cooling equipment from a cool roof offsets the increased winter heating
load.

Ryan,

If you look at Table 4 on page 7of the USGBC District Energy System
Modeling Guidelines, you will see district heating for step 2 can be
either a heating plant (boilers) or furnaces. Since your building falls
under system type 3, I believe you would use Option 1 and model fossil
fuel furnaces for heating in step 2.

 

Anyone else have a thought?

Yes, EnergyPlus uses the albedo in the TMY3 or snow cover in other files
to adjust the diffuse radiation.

Thanks for the response Drury!

 

So EnergyPlus will essentially adjust the reflectivity of a roof surface
hourly based on the albedo TMY data - that's promising!  Can we affect
the modeled behavior to account for means of preventing accumulation,
such as snow-melt cable or roof geometries?  

 

Also, can EnergyPlus (and/or, again, any other energy modeling
software/engine) take account for the variable insulative effects of
snow incident on the roof surface?  I realize accurately/realistically
modeling this behavior could be tricky/impossible with the removal of
snow depth information in TMY3 from TMY2 (from: 
http://www.doe2.com/Download/Weather/TMY3/Users_Manual_for_TMY3_Data_Set
s.pdf
<http://www.doe2.com/Download/Weather/TMY3/Users_Manual_for_TMY3_Data_Se
ts.pdf> ).

 

I'm bringing up and pressing this point because I think we as community
of energy modelers might want to begin modeling the thermal effects of
hourly roof snow cover (if we aren't already), both as a means of
influencing building design for energy-conscious decision making and as
a means of more accurately modeling real-life thermal behavior.  I did
some quick fact checking - snow has a fairly significant insulative
property (approximately R-1 per inch), and I am concerned that any
energy modeling performed for buildings in northerly climates might be
significantly off-base without accounting for the realities of
snow-cover on buildings.

 

PS:  I had to read up on the term albedo myself.  Recommended reading
for others at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo

 

PPS:  It appears snow cover in energy modeling is a pretty deep topic in
other circles... I found further recommended reading (powerpoint) for
those interested at:

Yes, EnergyPlus uses the albedo in the TMY3 or snow cover in other files
to adjust the diffuse radiation.

I'm starting a new "thread" as this is a definite tangent from the
emissivity discussion of the past few days.

 

A question occurred to me on reading Ralph / Chris's comments below...
does ANY energy modeling program/engine today use the snow cover data
present in TMY2 files?  There's obvious implications for things like
roof surface thermal behavior and hourly photovoltaic array performance
when you consider the reality of significant snow cover presence through
the day...

 

Of note... I'm no expert, but for others' reference I found a nice
resource this afternoon clarifying the what/why/how of TMY files here:  
http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/pubs/tmy2/

True indeed.

Except when your roofs are not covered with snow.

Here in Chicago, at least the past few years,  snow has come in bigger
chunks with more warmi and cold periods in between.  And rooftop snow
has been melting during the warm periods so  rooftops have been bare for
more of the winter.

It would be an interesting study (maybe I can find an undergrad or
interested masters student) to actually look at a typical flat roof
small commercial building and see if the increased summer efficiency of
cooling equipment from a cool roof offsets the increased winter heating
load.

I doubt very much that your "warm" roof will really help much. Go with
the cool roof.

	Chris makes a good point to consider with cool roofs.
	
	A cool roof will indeed reduce solar heat gain to the roof which
reduces its temp (good in summer) and reduces cooling requirements in
summer but will increase heating requirements in the winter.
	
	Until someone develops a material where the emissivity changes
with temperature (and not just wavelength) a cool roof that is good in
summer will be bad in winter.
	
	So, in colder climates, a cool roof can indeed increase the
overall energy use of a building.
	
	Even so, some northern cities like Chicago, mandate cool roofs
in building code.  Why?  Because the cool roof will reduce the urban

It's great insulation !!!  and it changes the albedo of the roof....  
You could even
capture rain / snow melt for re-use.... and you could even Snow every 
night and
melt it with the Sun to be caught the next day... avoiding peaking 
charges.....

Enough viewing into my bag of patent tricks for this evening.........
If you are intrigued by these suggestions you have my email above.

The only notice was posted within the CIR which was partially changed.
There is no maximum.  Projects are eligible for as many EAc1 points as are
available.

At USGBC.org, a CIR submitted 5/26/09 approvingly says that now projects are
eligible to claim more than 4 points EA1 Credit through process energy
efficiency savings and references a date 10/15/09.  I am unable to find any
document with this date.  

Is this notice posted somewhere other than the CIR page?  

What is the new maximum EA1 point eligibility for process energy efficiency
savings?

Hi,

we are currently working on a factory tenement building project in China.
The building has flexible units (manufacturing, warehouse, office space),
which companies starting business in China can rent for light production and
storage.- So we don't know the exact occupancy yet and there is no user, who
can give us information of the intended function/occupancy in the building.

We are looking for realistic specific values for internal thermal loads
(process loads) for various manufacturing occupancies.- Best would be with
schedules.

Please let me know, if you have such values or if you know of relevant
studies.- I would appreciate your help!

Dear Dr. Schwede,

In my opinion, there are several issues which affect your design criteria:
1) Manufacturing / process loads can easily exceed 500W / m2.  It is
certainly not practical to design a cooling system for this when the actual
load may be 5W / m2!
2) The actual value is rarely known by the client and is difficult to
determine without measurement of a similar, existing installation.  A rough
estimate can be obtained by dividing monthly usage by the operating hours,
but this method does not indicate peak loads, just average loads.
3) High electrical loads often affect only the cooling system and many /
most manufacturing occupancies do not provide cooling.  The exception to
this is when high amounts of ventilation air are required.
4) For "light production" loads, you may still find that the cooling system
size can vary dramatically.  Over-sized systems, of course, do not perform
very well for humidity control and may have shortened life due to high
cycling frequency at the low capacities.

With these in mind, I think that it is helpful for the designer to state
that "The cooling system is capable of maintaining xxC in the space on a
design day with yyyW / m2 of internal loads.  The customer is responsible
for providing additional cooling capacity for internal loads higher than
this."  In the US, it is common to provide a very basic heating system and
no cooling system for this type of leased / rented industrial facility.
Office areas are provided with a simple cooling system.  Any additional
capacity is provided by the customer when they lease the space.  This seems
like a good approach for you!

p.s., Since this is a modeling forum, it's worth mentioning that energy use
in a manufacturing facility can easily be 95% manufacturing / process loads
and 5% envelope loads.  For buildings with high internal loads, it can even
be beneficial to have NO insulation, since you are trying to reject heat all
year.

Dear Mr. Dirkes,

Thank you for your answer.- Most of what you write is in line with our
experience in manufacturing projects.- If you don't know what will happen in
the building, it is difficult to decide for a load as design condition. In
our experience the client and other project participants overestimate
internal loads based on installed electric capacities, which are not, as
know we know as building performance engineers, the same as the thermal
loads. - So, we are looking for substantiated experience values to set the
yyyW/m2 value somewhat realistic and to give our client confidence that the
design will meet the demand of most of his later tenants.

"The cooling system is capable of maintaining xxC in the space on a design
day with yyyW / m2 of internal loads.  The customer is responsible
for providing additional cooling capacity for internal loads higher than
this."

I have found some load profiles for industry buildings in the draft of the
GBCA (GB Council of Australia) for Industry Buildings
(http://www.gbca.org.au/green-star/rating-tools/green-star-industrial-pilot/
1761.htm), but it would be good to find more information.

My limited experience in this field is that factory production areas use spot cooling with fan coil units directed at the worker?s station only.  Worker productivity matters.  Ducted exhaust registers could be next to each heat generating machine.  There might be ventilation standards depending on pollutants from the industrial process.  It is not realistic or practical to offset the large heat gains from machinery with refrigeration.  In areas with cold winters the whole factory must be maintained above freezing temperatures to prevent broken pipes.  

Factory processes (industrial buildings) vary considerably and a standard for all industrial buildings is not practical.  It is in the interest of the factory to be as efficient as possible in all aspects because they are competing with other factories manufacturing the same product.  This is not the case with residential and commercial buildings and so they need energy usage standards.  For such buildings, equipment loads have to be the same for baseline and proposed.  The greater the equipment loads, the smaller the percentage energy savings for LEED credit.  Meeting codes and standards is not affected by percentages.  Credit is earned for reusing equipment heat gains to save energy with other heating tasks.

I am simulating a 2 pipe system and I am having trouble with the
schedules.  Has anyone simulated a 2 pipe system?

 

The problem I am having is that the output is showing space cooling
during all 12 months and heating only 4 months.

Hi everyone,

I am modeling a building with PTHP units installed. To account for an accurate U-Value of the external wall I want to calculate an area-weighted U-value, part of it is the "regular" external wall, the other section is the PTHP unit itself.

I already called several manufacturers to get information about the thermal
resistance for the heat transfer from the interior to the exterior, but couldn't get any info that would help.
Apparently this is not a topic for them.

Therefore, I was wondering if anybody has information about values that I can apply or if anybody knows any case studies that could help.

Thanks
Tobias

Hi Everyone,

 

I'm modeling an office building for LEED that has a DES system. The central
heating and cooling plants are located in the basement of the building, but
also serve other satellite buildings. The DES is owned and operated by a
separate entity (not the building owner). 

 

According to the following excerpt from the DES Guidance for LEED NC 2.2
document dated 3.28.2009 ? ?Also, the requirements in this document apply
only to the satellite buildings served by the central plant building; the
central plant building itself is treated as an ordinary building in
LEED-NC.?, it is our understanding that the building is not covered by the
DES Guidance document (i.e. we are not required to follow the two step
process). 

 

We also think that treating the project as ?ordinary building? means that
all central plant equipment should be modeled explicitly as if the building
had a dedicated plant, prorating capacities based on building sizes. 

 

Does anyone have any experience with this type of situation?

 

Thanks ahead of time,

Mike Karpman

Mike,

 

I have used the exception you noted below on several occasions but in my
opinion your building does not qualify. The exception is for when a
dedicated CEP building is to be modeled. While your building does
contain a central energy pant within it, the building is not a dedicated
CEP building due to the office located above.  I assume your building
purchases energy from the plant. A CEP building does not typically
purchase energy from itself which is why the exception was created.
Your office is in effect a satellite building with minimal transmission
losses.

 

Thanks

Energy and Building Systems Engineer (December 2009)

dbHMS is a Chicago based sustainable consulting engineering firm.  We are
currently working on projects in North America and India.  We are seeking
highly motivated and creative engineers for our Chicago office.

dbHMS creates concepts for building systems in collaboration with architects
and owners and then sees them through design and construction.  Our designs
focus on first principles and understanding of human comfort and the
environment to deliver approaches that minimize energy use and integrate
building architecture with building systems.  Our team includes engineers,
lighting designers, architects, building commissioning agents and
construction managers.

We perform building simulations to prove our concepts, design building
systems and oversee construction on our projects.  We use the following
tools to assist us:

1.     Building Simulations:  DOE 2.2, TRNSYS, Energy Plus and IES

2.     Lighting Analysis:  AGI32 and IES

3.     CFD:  FLUENT and IES

Message-ID: <E6863939B737E64C9523E15C683E966B0108FC37@HMP108.hilson_moran.local>

Does anyone have an experience on modeling a small district heating
system where:

1.       Proposed building buys chilled/hot water from a small district
network

2.       Chilled/hot water is provided to the district network by
central ground water heating pumps

 

Our concern refer to the baseline building - We intend the baseline made
as:

1.       Step 1 (under the 'Required treatment of District thermal
energy in LEED-NC version 2.2') - we consider constant volume FCU's
buying only chilled/hot water

2.       Step 2 -  constant volume FCU's feed by fossil fuel boiler and
packaged terminal air conditioner. We have a doubt on the fuel type to
be used for our boiler as the DES uses ground water heat pumps
electrically driven.

 

I would appreciate any feedback on this matter.

 

Mattia

Hi Matt,

 

I'm unsure if observing cooling behavior 12 months out of the year is
something to inherently be concerned about... year-round cooling is a
typical behavior for many buildings I've done in 4-season climates like
our own with significant 'core' zones -not cooling all of the time, but
there's almost always at least some in each month.  The ordinary
heating/cooling distribution can however significantly change in other
climates (a Montana project I just did comes to mind...).  If you're
unsure of what is normal, describe some of the project building
geometries and the climate/location, and often you'll find someone who
can let you know what they're used to observing regarding
heating/cooling behavior through the year.

 

Perhaps a helpful self-clarifying question for your situation is to
break it down a bit:  You're observing system cooling operation during
all 12 months.  Do you have internal/envelope loads that together call
for cooling every month?  If so, this is not an indication that anything
was modeled incorrectly with your 2-pipe system.  If anything,  you
might have something entered incorrectly regarding the calculation your
internal/envelope loads - on the other hand there may be nothing wrong
with what you're observing per above.

 

That said, if you feel there is a system issue, do you mean 2-pipe in
the sense of a shared heating/cooling loop (i.e. you can't have unitary
equipment simultaneously in "heating" and "cooling" mode), or 2-pipe in
the sense of only one loop (say, chilled water with electric unitary
coils)?

 

PS:  This is just a hunch, but if you have/develop a program-specific
question (equest?), you'll might get faster answers on that program's
mailing list - in any case you'll want to probably mention which program
you're using if you're using the [bldg-sim] list =).

Hi,

My PhD research is?about the?use of a?tilted solar chimney?to enhance natural?ventilation by stack effect, in Brazil.
I have built a test cell (picture attached) and I want to do computer simulations of?the solar chimney I proposed, in order to do some parametric analysis and to verify the performance in several locations through the country.
I tried to use EnergyPlus but it wasn't very successfull.
I need a suggestion of sotware that is suitable for what I need. Does anyone have an indication?
In case of using TRNSYS, it is possible to do this kind of simulation with the demo version, or do I have to have the TRNFlow module? (not available at demo version)

Thanks.

Leticia,

Due to the specific geometry and convection based airflow that might 
occur in the chimney, I'd suggest you to run a CFD (computational 
fluid dynamics) analysis for this. You can assign different heat 
gains from your solar surfaces (base on weather data I assume), then 
figure out the flow rate and flow regime inside the chimney. I think 
this is more a airflow/heat transfer problem than an energy simulation problem.

The good thing about using CFD in this case is that you can then do a 
parametric analysis for many different variables you might consider 
to look into. As for what CFD program to use, it will depend on what 
your university have available. I would think Fluent Airpak will do 
nicely in your case.

hope this helps

We are using FLUENT for simulating solar chimneys and the results are quite
good. But you need lot of patience to model it correctly in FLUENT or any
other CFD software.
another option is Design Builder, since it also has CFD feature in it. While
doing this, basically you would be using energyplus only but creating
gometry and defining CFD parameters is relatively easier through this route.

Message-ID: <7A93DB67D9AE2741BFF49B33EED6FB3D0E45F800@email.kling.us>

I'd like to get some feedback on my case regarding district Thermal
Energy.  I've had conflicting responses on the subject and have found no
definitive answer.

 

The baseline system qualifies to be modeled as System type 2 (PTHP). The
proposed system uses district chilled water only and no central heating
plant.  According to table 3, in the Required Treatment of District
Thermal Energy... document, Systems 1&2 are to be modeled as constant
volume fan coil units with hot water fossil fuel boilers.  My proposed
system uses all electric heating coils.  How is this cost-neutral
modeling?

 

Should I stay consistent with my proposed design and model the baseline
as constant volume fan coil with electric heating coils, or should I
model the baseline as constant volume fan coil with hot water electric
boilers?

 

Thanks, in advanced for any responses.

Hi Jason,

For Step 1, you should model it as indicated in the District Energy
Requirements document with hot water fossil fuel boilers.  Your Step 2
model would reflect PTHP systems.

Jason,
 
I have a situation that is identical to the one you describe. Modeling
the baseline in step 1 with gas, although as you say it may not seem
inline with the idea of cost-neutral modeling, it is specifically what
the document requires. That is the way I have proceeded. Good luck!

Hi Leticia

 

I note you are going to be attending the DesignBuilder webinar I'm giving
soon, so hopefully I'll be able to cover things in that which will allow you
to see how this could to some extent be carried out in DesignBuilder E+ and
CFD.

 

I would however note, the issue of flow instability will be difficult to
correctly establish and model in many tools.   Further, as you will need to
consider the effects of buoyancy combined with wind effects on chimneys, I'm
not certain that the algorithms used in the E+ will be able to deal with
this sufficiently accurately to allow comparison with the test cell.
Perhaps others on this list might be able to provide further insight on
this, but things that spring to mind include unsteady flow effects and
discharge coefficient variation.  At the very least your modelling will
require careful application of appropriate wind surface coefficient values
in the E+ model but I won't go into too much here as it will bore everyone
else rigid.  It is possible to get reasonable comparison as is pointed out
in the following IJoV paper, but I think you may be forced down the route of
complex turbulence modelling to get good accuracy of your CFD which may
force you down an alternative software route.   That being the case, it will
still be worth carrying out the E+ model and getting some boundary
conditions that puts your CFD simulations in the right area first off and
hence should increase the accuracy of them or at least allow them to get
somewhere near a reasonable solution.  You might want to check out FDS which
will allow you to carry out transient LES turbulence models which I think
will be better for your research.  

 

I'll try and get an electronic copy of my PhD thesis together for you and
you might also wish to check out the links to following papers that might
help you:

Subject: [Bldg-sim] help in PhD research - solar chimney simulation

 

Hi,

 

My PhD research is about the use of a tilted solar chimney to enhance
natural ventilation by stack effect, in Brazil.

I have built a test cell (picture attached) and I want to do computer
simulations of the solar chimney I proposed, in order to do some parametric
analysis and to verify the performance in several locations through the
country.

I tried to use EnergyPlus but it wasn't very successfull.

I need a suggestion of sotware that is suitable for what I need. Does anyone
have an indication?

In case of using TRNSYS, it is possible to do this kind of simulation with
the demo version, or do I have to have the TRNFlow module? (not available at
demo version)

 

Thanks.

Leticia

Hello,

Has anyone used Ecotect to analyze solar absorption/reflectance for a surface , for example a building fa?ade? Using Ecotect, it is possible to calculate the incident solar radiation values but I am more interested to find if the software could be used to  determine the solar reflectance/absorption values to help compare various design options.

Any thoughts or suggestions on this issue is very much appreciated.

Dear all,

I would like to estimate the value of the chtc due to heated surfaces or
other heating devices within a zone when the zone is naturally ventilated
(estimate of 1 AC/h). I have the values for the chtc's in the absence of any

Any suggestions are welcome!

Hi

What you describe sounds like an impossibility for all software, and is certainly I think impossible for Ecotect. Perhaps I am misunderstanding the question? You seem to be asking whether Ecotect (or other software products) can measure the physical properties of a building facade? Building physical properties are input parameters to simulation programs and to Ecotect. One needs a field instrument to do this, not a piece of software..?

Priya,

It is not possible to measure the physical properties of a material through
a software. As Michael said, it needs to be measured through field
instruments. However, you seem to want to compare the effects of absorptance
and reflectance of different facade materials for a given design problem. Is
that correct? If yes, you can definitely simulate the reflectance and
absorptance of a given material using Ecotect. This page gives complete
details on how to do it: http://squ1.org/wiki/Solar_Absorption.

You can define the characteristics for two different materials and apply
them one by one to the facade under investigation to see how it makes a
difference. However, I am not too confident of Ecotect's capabilities in
this regard yet. For example, I modified the external layer of a material
assembly (for a wall) and recalculated physical properties through Ecotect.
The solar absorptance did not get updated. This leads me to believe that the
feature is not reliable. If you are familiar with IES Virtual Environment,
then that is a much better tool for studying the changes in material
assemblies. If you're just interested in the heat gain/loss, thermal lag
kind of stuff, a very simple tool that you can use for free is OPAQUE (
http://www.energy-design-tools.aud.ucla.edu/). This link has other useful
tools that you might already be using (they are so helpful!).

Hope this helps.



Thanks,

Anupam

Friends,
                
We have a central plant serving an existing building and an renovated building
in Washington, DC . We are applying for LEED-NC for the
renovated building. We are required to follow the ?Required treatment of
District thermal energy in LEED-NC version 2.2? method for our EAc1
credits.
                 Does anyone have an advice on what utility rates can be used for
chilled/hot water. Although we have a source for district steam rates I am not able find chilled water rates.  The eia.doe.gov site does not seem to provide the rates either.. Also, I am not sure if
we are justified in using commercial rates which can be significantly
higher as they include delivery and service charges.. The rates used can have a significant impact on the total savings as they determine
the proportion of electricity and chilled/hot water costs.

thanks for your responses,
raj

IBPSA-Canada's biennial conference, eSim, brings together professionals,
academics and students interested in building performance simulation
issues and applications. The 2010 conference is hosted by Manitoba
Hydro, in collaboration with the National Research Council of Canada. It
will be held in Winnipeg, Canada on May 19 and 20, 2010 (pre-conference
and post-conference workshops on May 18 and 21, 2010).

 

Conference Keynote Speakers Confirmed 

 

Professor Ian Beausoleil-Morrison of Carleton University and Thomas
Auer, Managing Director and Partner of Transsolar GmBH have been
confirmed as the Keynote Speakers of eSim 2010. Ian has a rich
experience of simulation tool development and use in Canada and
internationally, notably leading the successful IEA Annex 42 (Simulation
of Building-Integrated Fuel Cell and Other Cogeneration Systems); Thomas
has developed energy and building services concepts for projects around
the world noted for their innovative design and low energy use. Manitoba
Hydro Place is one such example of where Thomas's firm has utilized
simulation to design what is considered one of the most energy efficient
high rise buildings in North America. The conference organizers are
excited to have both these individuals as part of the conference as they
are both highly regarded within the industry.

 

Call for Software Demos

 

Software companies and individuals are invited to take part in special
software demo sessions during the conference. Much like technical
presentations, the software demo sessions will consist of presentations
in front of an audience. However, these presentations will not be
peer-reviewed and therefore not included in the conference proceedings -
although the submission of a technical paper on the software that meets
one of the conference themes is encouraged! To be eligible for a
presentation during the software demo sessions, the software must be a
commercial product or be freely available (on a web site for example).
Furthermore, the presenter must be a registered participant. Please note
that the scientific committee has the right to limit the number of
software tools being presented.

 

To submit, just click on the "Software Demo Submission" tab on 
www.esim.ca <http://www.esim.ca/> 

 

Paper Submission Deadline for Manuscripts Reminder - December 17th

 

For those individuals who have had their abstracts approved by the
Scientific Committee, the paper submission deadline for manuscripts of
December 17th is quickly approaching. Please be sure to submit your
papers on time.

 Hi all,

I'm trying to find the version 3.1.0 Build 027 of EnergyPlus for Linux, but
it seems not available online any more. I recently reinstalled my system and
lost the installation fill. Could someone help me with this? I'd really
appreciate your help.

Thank you.

Hi,
Does anyone know where I can find weather data for Medellin, Columbia?
In particular, I'm looking for 8760 hour weather data, but, I'll settle for reduced hour weather data if that's all that is available.
Thanks.

	velocity on thermal comfort
Message-ID: <423322.27639.qm@web58008.mail.re3.yahoo.com>

Hi, 

I am trying to model the impact of ceiling fans on thermal comfort in a warm-humid climate, for a naturally ventilated building. Intial simulation runs obviously show a lot of discomfort with PMV going upto 5.5 during peak summer. We want to model ceiling fans so that the impact of air velocity on thermal comfort is captured. Naturally this wont lead to achieving thermal comfort conditions in the space but we feel that it should at least result in PMV coming down to 4-4.5. I am not sure if doing this is possible in DesignBuilder but I think one can specify an object called AirVelocity schedule in EnergyPlus, where one can input air velocity in m/s in one of the fields (the current EPlus default being 0.137). I want to know that if we modify (increase) the value of air velocity to about 0.7 (for ceiling fans), would it be used for comfort calculations? I thought the Fanger comfort model algorithms use air velocity for calculations but I can't see that
 happening anywhere in the Eplus Engineering reference, which could also have been a resultant of my limited understanding of the subject matter. I also noticed that the Pierce model takes air velocity into account. Does this mean that we should rather look at the Pierce model rather than the Fanger model in order to arrive at an adaptive model of thermal comfort? What we basically want to do is to make sure that the increased air velocity is used for calculation of PMV in EnergyPlus to model the impact of ceiling fans. 

I would be really grateful for any help.

ASHARE 55 does give a bit of information about the thermal comfort in section 5.2.3.

However the section says that the elevated speed can be used to offset the temperature by not more than 30 C (5.40 F).

The air speed considered here is however in the range of 0.8 m/s to 1m/s. However the ceiling fans designed in here in India

gives an air speed of about 2m/s for which the temperature that could be offset can be more.

No specific relation as such is given as to determine the temperature that can be offset for higher air speeds.I have referred the 

Thermal Comfort chapter of the ASHRAE Fundamentals handbook,however no particular specifics is given as to relation between the

Air speed felt on the skin and the temperature that can be offset due to it. Definitely the personal comfort level also varies with person to person.

If anyone knows about any other standard or reference manual giving information on this matter or can throw more light on this it

will be greatly appreciated.

Hi Sanyogita,

Just to mention that in DesignBuilder, you can define the velocity to be used for the comfort calculations on the Simulation tab of the model options dialog, under the Advanced header. I tried changing from the default air velocity from 0.137 m/s to 2 m/s and obtained very different results for all comfort indices, including Fanger PMV.

Regards,

Andy

EnergyPlus does include room air velocity term in Fanger model.  It looks like this detail did not make it into the E+'s Engineering Reference, but a value for forced convection surface heat transfer coefficient is calculated using:
Hc = 12.1 * SQRT(velocity)

However, the calculations take the larger of either a natural convection Hc or the forced convection Hc, so the air velocity might not be used in all situations.

I could not find the input field for specifying?velocity anywhere. Is it something to do with the version; I am using 2.0.4.002. And one more question: when we use the Operative temperature control in DesignBuilder, it takes radiant fraction of 0.5 by default, and its not possible to change it, am I right?

Thanks a lot,

Hi Eric,

 

I dont know why but I still dont see it anywhere. Is there some some other
precondition within the program or model options for it to appear??

Thanks for your patience,

The below screen shot will show you where the comfort velocity is in the
model options tool (spanner icon) under simulation tab in the advanced
option

Hi Andy,

 

I could not find the input field for specifying velocity anywhere. Is it
something to do with the version; I am using 2.0.4.002. And one more
question: when we use the Operative temperature control in DesignBuilder, it
takes radiant fraction of 0.5 by default, and its not possible to change it,
am I right?

 

Thanks a lot,

Hi Sanyogita,

 

Just to mention that in DesignBuilder, you can define the velocity to be
used for the comfort calculations on the Simulation tab of the model options
dialog, under the Advanced header. I tried changing from the default air
velocity from 0.137 m/s to 2 m/s and obtained very different results for all
comfort indices, including Fanger PMV.

 

Regards,

 

Andy

velocity on thermal comfort

 

Hi, 

I am trying to model the impact of ceiling fans on thermal comfort in a
warm-humid climate, for a naturally ventilated building. Intial simulation
runs obviously show a lot of discomfort with PMV going upto 5.5 during peak
summer. We want to model ceiling fans so that the impact of air velocity on
thermal comfort is captured. Naturally this wont lead to achieving thermal
comfort conditions in the space but we feel that it should at least result
in PMV coming down to 4-4.5. I am not sure if doing this is possible in
DesignBuilder but I think one can specify an object called AirVelocity
schedule in EnergyPlus, where one can input air velocity in m/s in one of
the fields (the current EPlus default being 0.137). I want to know that if
we modify (increase) the value of air velocity to about 0.7 (for ceiling
fans), would it be used for comfort calculations? I thought the Fanger
comfort model algorithms use air velocity for calculations but I can't see
that happening anywhere in the Eplus Engineering reference, which could also
have been a resultant of my limited understanding of the subject matter. I
also noticed that the Pierce model takes air velocity into account. Does
this mean that we should rather look at the Pierce model rather than the
Fanger model in order to arrive at an adaptive model of thermal comfort?
What we basically want to do is to make sure that the increased air velocity
is used for calculation of PMV in EnergyPlus to model the impact of ceiling
fans. 

I would be really grateful for any help.

Dear All,

Let's say we have a two storey building that is 80000 sq.ft. Half of the
building is climatised with CAV system/FCU units with boiler / chiller.
This part also uses extensive daylighting and natural ventilation.

The rest is climatised using VRF system from Mitsubishi and local heat
exchanger ventilators.

What would you recommend in terms of software for energy simulation for
LEED EAC1 application?

Hi All,
 
Just an FYI on a recent publication (Sept. 09) available for free
online:
 
"Technical Support Document: 50% Energy Savings Design Technology
Packages for Medium Office Buildings"
http://www.pnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-187
74.pdf
 
I just glanced through it (138 page document - 1.2MB file) but I see a
lot of good stuff on efficient design and energy modeling.
Good explanations on modeling baseline and proposed models using ASHRAE
Standard 90.1, with specifics on radiant heating and cooling,
DOAS, VAV and many of the ECMs that would typically be considered for an
energy-efficient design.
 
There are lots of tips for EnergyPlus users, since that's what was used
for the modeling, but much of the document applies to anyone modeling
ASHRAE 90.1 baselines and subsequent conservation measures.
 
Cheers,
Bill

DOE sponsored a lot work of this sort in 2009.  Here are links to related
studies on some other types of buildings.

Hi All,

 

Just an FYI on a recent publication (Sept. 09) available for free online:

 

"Technical Support Document: 50% Energy Savings Design Technology Packages
for Medium Office Buildings"

http://www.pnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-18774.p
df

 

I just glanced through it (138 page document - 1.2MB file) but I see a lot
of good stuff on efficient design and energy modeling.

Good explanations on modeling baseline and proposed models using ASHRAE
Standard 90.1, with specifics on radiant heating and cooling,

DOAS, VAV and many of the ECMs that would typically be considered for an
energy-efficient design.

 

There are lots of tips for EnergyPlus users, since that's what was used for
the modeling, but much of the document applies to anyone modeling

ASHRAE 90.1 baselines and subsequent conservation measures.

 

Cheers,

Bill

Happy new year. 
Would nay one recommend a geothermal enginnering or contracting company who have experience in horisontal or Pond geothermal system. This is for a 48 unit residential project with an exisitng water pond that might be used in a geothermal heat pump system for HVAC and water heating in Goergia.
Thank you

I dont know why but I still dont see it anywhere. Is there some some other?precondition?within the program or model options for it to appear??

The below screen shot will show you where the comfort velocity is in the model options tool (spanner icon) under simulation tab in the advanced option 

? 

Operative temperature description can be found here: http://www.designbuilder.co.uk/programhelp/calculation_options.htm

Hi Andy, 


? 


I could not find the input field for specifying?velocity anywhere. Is it something to do with the version; I am using 2.0.4.002. And one more question: when we use the Operative temperature control in DesignBuilder, it takes radiant fraction of 0.5 by default, and its not possible to change it, am I right? 


? 


Thanks a lot, 
?

Hi Sanyogita, 

? 

Just to mention that in DesignBuilder, you can define the velocity to be used for the comfort calculations on the Simulation tab of the model options dialog, under the Advanced header. I tried changing from the default air velocity from 0.137 m/s to 2 m/s and obtained very different results for all comfort indices, including Fanger PMV. 

? 

Regards, 

?

Hi, 

I am trying to model the impact of ceiling fans on thermal comfort in a warm-humid climate, for a naturally ventilated building. Intial simulation runs obviously show a lot of discomfort with PMV going upto 5.5 during peak summer. We want to model ceiling fans so that the impact of air velocity on thermal comfort is captured. Naturally this wont lead to achieving thermal comfort conditions in the space but we feel that it should at least result in PMV coming down to 4-4.5. I am not sure if doing this is possible in DesignBuilder but I think one can specify an object called AirVelocity schedule in EnergyPlus, where one can input air velocity in m/s in one of the fields (the current EPlus default being 0.137). I want to know that if we modify (increase) the value of air velocity to about 0.7 (for ceiling fans), would it be used for comfort calculations? I thought the Fanger comfort model algorithms use air velocity for calculations but I can't see that happening anywhere in the Eplus Engineering reference, which could also have been a resultant of my limited understanding of the subject matter. I also noticed that the Pierce model takes air velocity into account. Does this mean that we should rather look at the Pierce model rather than the Fanger model in order to arrive at an adaptive model of thermal comfort? What we basically want to do is to make sure that the increased air velocity is used for calculation of PMV in EnergyPlus to model the impact of ceiling fans. 

I would be really grateful for any help. 

Regards,?
