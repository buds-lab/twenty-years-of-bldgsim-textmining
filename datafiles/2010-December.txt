Hi Hwakong,

Do you have any idea if it is legal to use  www.wunderground.com<http://www.wunderground.com> data for commercial purpose. Do you aware if one need to pay to  www.wunderground.com<http://www.wunderground.com> to use their data for commercial purpose


Thanks

Hi Aaron,

Building your own weather file can be difficult and tedious, especially gathering the appropriate solar data. Here are a couple alternatives that may be appropriate depending on the specific context of your project:

1 - Compare the heating and cooling degree days between your performance period and the TMY weather. If you have multiple years of utility data and associated weather data, the weather variations each year might average out to be very similar to the TMY. If they are moderately different, you could attempt to adjust modeling results based on this difference?
2 - If you create a custom weather file for a short performance period (e.g. one year or less) and tune your model to the utility data from that period, then your results are only applicable to performance during that period. Maybe that's what you want. A different way to look at it would be to generalize the results to a typical year (i.e. the TMY weather). One method is to develop regression fits of measured energy use as a function of outside air temperature. For example, graph hourly hot water use against measured hourly outside air temperature and do a curve fit. The relationship is generally linear but perhaps with a change-point (where the slope changes). With the regressions, you can apply these relationships to the weather data in the TMY file to generalize the measured energy use to energy use during a typical year. Thus, calibrating a TMY-based energy model to the normalized baseline would be an apples to apples comparison and the results would be generalized to typical conditions rather than just the specific conditions during your performance period. There's more to it, but that's the general gist.

Also, there was a great spreadsheet tool that was shared on bldg-sim a couple years ago that used macros to automatically gather and compile actual (hourly or even sub-hourly) weather data from weather stations on www.wunderground.com<http://www.wunderground.com>. But no solar data. I use this tool exclusively now for gathering real weather data.

Good luck,
Hwakong

Aaron-

The question "are model results significantly impacted by the difference between historic weather data and performance-period data" is a complex one, however, here is an approach that may be helpful if you need to construct your own custom weather file.

You can purchase historical weather data available from NOAA station data from the NCDC<http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/ncdc.html>.  However, these data sets do not include solar radiation data and often need some QC work (remove extraneous observations, fill gaps, etc).  In the past, I have also downloaded weather data from the EnergyPlus<http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/weatherdata_download.cfm> site in IWEC format, and converted to .bin using a combination of the E+ weather data processor and EPW conversion tool available on the DOE-2 Website<http://doe2.com/index_Wth.html#eQ_WthProc>.  However, although a great deal (a FREE service), in my experience, this data can have gaps that are too large to fill with the algorithms NREL prescribes, which then leads you to either piecing this together w/ some other data source, or, only evaluating the model performance over the periods you have data for.  For many of my projects, I need a complete year or more, so the E+ method was not ideal.

I recently created some DOE-2 .bin weather files using the following approach, using data formatting/calculation procedures automated in MATLAB, and then the "DOEWth.exe" utility (an older, command line program also available from DOE-2.com) to generate a .bin weather file.  Once automated, this process can be completed in a relatively short period of time. The following is a brief explanation of the process I used that may give you some ideas:

1)  Downloaded NOAA data (Integrated Surface Data) for closest site.

2)  Cleaned data of extraneous points and filled gaps in data using NREL<http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/pdfs/weatherdata_guide_34303.pdf> filling routines.  There is usually always one or more observations recorded for every hour, however, in many cases one or more of the variables you need for the simulation weather file may not have been reported.

If you can obtain measured solar data for your location, skip steps 3-5

3)  Used the Zhang-Huang solar model (discussed in the E+ engineering manual) to estimate total horizontal solar radiation with custom model parameters developed using least-squares regression to TMY3 data.  In this case, I assumed TMY data was more or less "true", however, for one station data I worked with, I noticed some cloud cover observations did not appear to be consistent the reported solar radiation data.  However, the custom coefficients yeilded better results than the default coefficients reported in the E+ literature when I compared the model output to a short sample of actual measured solar radiation data I had.

4)  Used another model to determine the diffuse solar radiation component from the total global radiation.  In my case, I used a custom model developed for the Pacific NW (published in a thesis) however, there are many similar models developed from various datasets.  Orgill and Hollands is a popular model, although they are all very similar.

5) Once you have the two solar components above, direct normal solar radiation can be readily calculated.

6) With all of the necessary data now assembled, format into the TMY2 format for processing into a .bin file using the DOEWth utility.  Using the DOEWth output summary file and a weather file plotting program, like D-View, you can "inspect" the measured data to make sure it matches what you expect and aligns with daily or month averages more readily available.

A few notes:
- The DOEWth utilty does have format methods that will calculate solar data, however, I choose to pre-process the solar data using the solar radiation models I preferred, which leads you to using the TMY2 format method.
- I did not calculate illuminance data since my project did not include daylighting controls.  There are models available for calculating illuminance, and the DOE-2 program may use a model to estimate it from solar radiation data (need to brush up on this section of the engineers manual to confirm this).
-  Related to the above comment, there are many different models out there for calculating solar radiation/illuminance data from other measured parameters. I choose the above because I felt like the models best captured the variables that I thought were important, and to  lesser degree, I could readily implement them in my programming.  Other than comparing these models to actual TMY data, I have not rigorously compared these model to others available, so you may want to explore others.
- For any source of weather data you pursue, I would emphasize reviewing how data is filled and non-measured variables are calculated (i.e. what models were used).

I just realized this post may use the word "model" a record number of times, but hope you find it useful.

When I'm engaged in Measurement and Verification, I can install a weather station that records data for performance period to allow for calibration. (http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/Publications/BuildingSimulation2009.GundHallModel.pdf)

But for an investment-grade energy audit with historic bills, I'm not sure where to turn for all the variables needed to construct a weather file.

Anyone on this list have a recommendation?

Hi Guys,

 

YES - The thermal modelling of residential buildings is significantly
affected by the use of non site measured / synchronised weather
observations. 

 

In our empirical validation research we have found only the occasional day
where the air temperature may be the same but the Solar radiation values
(Global, Direct beam & Diffuse) are considerably different. But generally,
there were significant difference (between 4 & 7 Deg C) in the min & max
values on a daily basis. 

 

At a recent meeting with a government agencies in Australia, I raised
concern with regard to the general flattening of the min & max values that
appears to occur in the development of the TMY file. It is these times of
min & max when cooling or heating models are invoked & energy is used.

Hi Aaron,
 
Building your own weather file can be difficult and tedious, especially
gathering the appropriate solar data. Here are a couple alternatives that
may be appropriate depending on the specific context of your project:
 
1 - Compare the heating and cooling degree days between your performance
period and the TMY weather. If you have multiple years of utility data and
associated weather data, the weather variations each year might average out
to be very similar to the TMY. If they are moderately different, you could
attempt to adjust modeling results based on this difference?
2 - If you create a custom weather file for a short performance period (e.g.
one year or less) and tune your model to the utility data from that period,
then your results are only applicable to performance during that period.
Maybe that's what you want. A different way to look at it would be to
generalize the results to a typical year (i.e. the TMY weather). One method
is to develop regression fits of measured energy use as a function of
outside air temperature. For example, graph hourly hot water use against
measured hourly outside air temperature and do a curve fit. The relationship
is generally linear but perhaps with a change-point (where the slope
changes). With the regressions, you can apply these relationships to the
weather data in the TMY file to generalize the measured energy use to energy
use during a typical year. Thus, calibrating a TMY-based energy model to the
normalized baseline would be an apples to apples comparison and the results
would be generalized to typical conditions rather than just the specific
conditions during your performance period. There's more to it, but that's
the general gist. 

Also, there was a great spreadsheet tool that was shared on bldg-sim a
couple years ago that used macros to automatically gather and compile actual
(hourly or even sub-hourly) weather data from weather stations on
www.wunderground.com. But no solar data. I use this tool exclusively now for
gathering real weather data. 
 
Good luck,
Hwakong

Aaron- 

The question "are model results significantly impacted by the difference
between historic weather data and performance-period data" is a complex one,
however, here is an approach that may be helpful if you need to construct
your own custom weather file.

You can purchase historical weather data available from NOAA station data
from the NCDC <http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/ncdc.html> .  However, these data
sets do not include solar radiation data and often need some QC work (remove
extraneous observations, fill gaps, etc).  In the past, I have also
downloaded weather data from the EnergyPlus
<http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/weatherdata_download.cfm>
site in IWEC format, and converted to .bin using a combination of the E+
weather data processor and EPW conversion tool available on the DOE-2
Website <http://doe2.com/index_Wth.html#eQ_WthProc> .  However, although a
great deal (a FREE service), in my experience, this data can have gaps that
are too large to fill with the algorithms NREL prescribes, which then leads
you to either piecing this together w/ some other data source, or, only
evaluating the model performance over the periods you have data for.  For
many of my projects, I need a complete year or more, so the E+ method was
not ideal.

I recently created some DOE-2 .bin weather files using the following
approach, using data formatting/calculation procedures automated in MATLAB,
and then the "DOEWth.exe" utility (an older, command line program also
available from DOE-2.com) to generate a .bin weather file.  Once automated,
this process can be completed in a relatively short period of time. The
following is a brief explanation of the process I used that may give you
some ideas:

1)  Downloaded NOAA data (Integrated Surface Data) for closest site.

2)  Cleaned data of extraneous points and filled gaps in data using NREL
<http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/pdfs/weatherdata_guide_34
303.pdf>  filling routines.  There is usually always one or more
observations recorded for every hour, however, in many cases one or more of
the variables you need for the simulation weather file may not have been
reported.  

If you can obtain measured solar data for your location, skip steps 3-5

3)  Used the Zhang-Huang solar model (discussed in the E+ engineering
manual) to estimate total horizontal solar radiation with custom model
parameters developed using least-squares regression to TMY3 data.  In this
case, I assumed TMY data was more or less "true", however, for one station
data I worked with, I noticed some cloud cover observations did not appear
to be consistent the reported solar radiation data.  However, the custom
coefficients yeilded better results than the default coefficients reported
in the E+ literature when I compared the model output to a short sample of
actual measured solar radiation data I had.  

4)  Used another model to determine the diffuse solar radiation component
from the total global radiation.  In my case, I used a custom model
developed for the Pacific NW (published in a thesis) however, there are many
similar models developed from various datasets.  Orgill and Hollands is a
popular model, although they are all very similar.

5) Once you have the two solar components above, direct normal solar
radiation can be readily calculated.

6) With all of the necessary data now assembled, format into the TMY2 format
for processing into a .bin file using the DOEWth utility.  Using the DOEWth
output summary file and a weather file plotting program, like D-View, you
can "inspect" the measured data to make sure it matches what you expect and
aligns with daily or month averages more readily available.

A few notes:
- The DOEWth utilty does have format methods that will calculate solar data,
however, I choose to pre-process the solar data using the solar radiation
models I preferred, which leads you to using the TMY2 format method.
- I did not calculate illuminance data since my project did not include
daylighting controls.  There are models available for calculating
illuminance, and the DOE-2 program may use a model to estimate it from solar
radiation data (need to brush up on this section of the engineers manual to
confirm this). 
-  Related to the above comment, there are many different models out there
for calculating solar radiation/illuminance data from other measured
parameters. I choose the above because I felt like the models best captured
the variables that I thought were important, and to  lesser degree, I could
readily implement them in my programming.  Other than comparing these models
to actual TMY data, I have not rigorously compared these model to others
available, so you may want to explore others.  
- For any source of weather data you pursue, I would emphasize reviewing how
data is filled and non-measured variables are calculated (i.e. what models
were used).  

I just realized this post may use the word "model" a record number of times,
but hope you find it useful.

A recent LEED MV plan review comment asked "please indicate the proposed

performance period."

 

This raises the question for me - are model results significantly impacted
by the difference between historic weather data and performance-period data?

 

When I'm engaged in Measurement and Verification, I can install a weather
station that records data for performance period to allow for calibration.

But for an investment-grade energy audit with historic bills, I'm not sure
where to turn for all the variables needed to construct a weather file.

 

Anyone on this list have a recommendation? 

 

(I'm specifically looking for NYC, 2009, weather data for an eQUEST model.)

In one of our project the electricity to run all the building uses is
produced by the DG set with in the building Campus. The grid electricity is
not available at the site and the DG sets are used to produce the

How should I compare the end-use energy cost of Ashrae BaseCase and my

Should I take the Ashrae BaseCase also running with DG sets and finally
compare the cost with diesel to diesel only .

Ganesh,
 
There are some good threads if you search for "BEM exam" or "BEMP" at
the bldg-sim archive here:
http://lists.onebuilding.org/pipermail/bldg-sim-onebuilding.org/
 
I took the first exam in January, and did an immediate brain-dump
afterward, so my recollection is sketchy. That being said, here are my
quick thoughts regarding your questions:
1. No ASHRAE Standard-specific questions.
2. You do not need to know Standard 140.
3. No questions regarding specific software packages.
4. I can not recommend a specific path for preparing. Energy modeling
and energy auditing experience is the best preparation.
5. I am not aware of any exam-specific resources, other than what
appears on the ASHRAE website. There were/are supposed to be BEM
workshops but I don't have further information.
The ASHRAE Fundamentals Ch. 19 "Energy Estimating and Modeling Methods"
has good info but is very dense/technical and soporific. The exam is
difficult, and really tests experience more than just smarts or
exam-preparation skills.
 
I copied this to the bldg-sim list so other exam takers can share their

To clarify a couple of points about the exam ? all questions will relate to
the Detailed Content Outline (DCO).



The references are provided as potential resources in performing those tasks
from the DCO.  As Bill mentioned,  just because Standard 140 is listed as a
resource doesn?t guarantee that a question on that standard will be
included, although it may still be helpful document to understand the
mechanics of energy modeling, and as the exam is revised periodically
questions on varying topics from the DCO may be added/removed.



Regarding ASHRAE standard-specific questions ? you won?t have to have
memorized tables of performance data or efficiencies, but you will want to
have some general ideas of what good and best practices are.  You do need to
know which standard covers what material, which would be normal experience
in the course of working on several modeling projects.



Many of the tasks identified in the DCO use processes that are aligned with
one of the ASHRAE Standards, even without asking about a particular rate or
efficiency from the standards?again anyone with the required modeling work
experience will have this exposure.



The exam absolutely tests experience, if you aren?t practiced at working on
modeling projects then it will be difficult to pass the exam, even if you
were able to memorize each of the listed references in their entirety.  If
you felt that you were at the lower end of the work experience scale, the
90.1 User?s Manual is probably one of the first resources to review.



Some BEM workshops are available from IBPSA-USA/ASHRAE/RMI and offered in
various locations.  If a general energy modeling workshop from another
vendor was offered in your location it probably would also be useful.  The
workshops are intended to train on modeling practices, not the exam
specifically.



Work on four LEED models is probably going to be much less experience than
most people who take the exam, as it isn?t intended to be an entry-level
certification.  Even a licensed engineer/architect is still required to have
two years of modeling experience to be eligible to take the exam.



I hope this helps!

Ganesh,



There are some good threads if you search for ?BEM exam? or ?BEMP? at the
bldg-sim archive here:

http://lists.onebuilding.org/pipermail/bldg-sim-onebuilding.org/



I took the first exam in January, and did an immediate brain-dump afterward,
so my recollection is sketchy. That being said, here are my quick thoughts
regarding your questions:

1. No ASHRAE Standard-specific questions.

2. You do not need to know Standard 140.

3. No questions regarding specific software packages.

4. I can not recommend a specific path for preparing. Energy modeling and
energy auditing experience is the best preparation.

5. I am not aware of any exam-specific resources, other than what appears on
the ASHRAE website. There were/are supposed to be BEM workshops but I don?t
have further information.

The ASHRAE Fundamentals Ch. 19 ?Energy Estimating and Modeling Methods? has
good info but is very dense/technical and soporific. The exam is difficult,
and really tests experience more than just smarts or exam-preparation
skills.



I copied this to the bldg-sim list so other exam takers can share their
experiences.



Best of luck,

Bill

Hi Bill,



I understand that you are BEMP certified , I have planned to take up the
exam. I have few queries regarding this exam I would be glad if you could
answer them.



I would like to know specific nature of questions asked in this exam.



1.       Will the questions be related to ASHRAE 90.1, 62.1 or 55 standard
or only general engineering questions as given in the sample questions in
ASHRAE website.



2.       In syllabi section ASHRAE had included Standard 140 do we really
need to know the process for testing new energy simulation software.



3.       Will any questions be related to any specific simulation software



4.       Do you recommend any specific path to be followed for preparing for
this exam.



5.       Any other resources apart from the one given in the ASHRAE website.



Your recommended time for preparation for the exam considering exhaustive
nature of syllabi. My experience is limited and I have done whole building
simulation , mainly for LEED, for four buildings. So I would like to have
your inputs to sit for the exam.





Regards,

Ganesh.

Ankur,

I have not run across the term DG set before and am not sure what a bill for
them would look like. Can you give us a little more information about how
the DG sets operate and how they are billed?

In any case, you should use the same utility, DG sets, schedule for both the
base case and proposed buildings.

Carol,

DG Sets are Diesel Generators, uses Diesel as fuel to produce the
electricity.

If I use the Diesel Generator which produces the electricity for all
building end-uses for the Base Case, then what efficiency should I used. Is
any parameters are specified by the ASHRAE for electricity generators.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] M&E Rooms, Restrooms, storage & Thermal zoning
Message-ID: <959779.60169.qm@web113105.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hello,


I am modeling an retail?building and I would just like to know if other modelers 
just simply model?rooms like M&E rooms, storage rooms?and?restrooms as 
unconditioned space. The? M&E rooms and storagerooms?are not heated and is just 
served by exhaust fans so I can simply model it as unconditioned.?Is this 
correct? Table G3.1.10. HVAC Systems says that "Where no heating system exists 
or heating has been specified, the heating system shall be assumed elec" and 
"Where no cooling system exist or no cooling system has been specified, the 
cooling system shal be identical to the system modeled in the?baseline building 
design". So I am thinking that I may not be following this section of Appendix 
G.???

For restrooms which are in the office area and has just exhaust ventilation, do 
I simulate it as conditioned since it will be drawing conditioned air in the 
office or?should I just simulate it as unconditioned area since the room has no 
thermostat?

I am also attaching a floor plan and would like to have your comments if I am 
zoning right or if it has too many zones.


Thanks in advance,


Jaigath

Shariq,

You may want to look at Meteonorm. I have a weather file for Kabul, but it is in .tm2 format for TRNSYS.

Meteonorm also has: Herat, Kandahar, Termez and Zaranj.

Hi All,

 

Does anyone know if the for mean radiant temperature calculation for
energy plus has the ability to take into account direct solar gain (ie
not indirectly from surfaces)? 

 

If not, how could this be accounted for in thermal comfort? Results from
a person standing near a window could be quite misleading if the direct
solar gain is not taken into account.

Hi Ross,

According to Energy Plus engineeringreference " There are three options to
calculate mean radiant temperature in the thermal comfort models. One is the
zone averaged MRT, another is the surface weighted MRT, and the other is
angle factor MRT. The zone averaged MRT is calculated on the assumption that
a person is in the center of a space, whereas the surface weighted MRT is
calculated in consideration of the surface that a person is closest to, and
the angle factor MRT is calculated based on angle factors between a person
and the different surfaces in a space. Here, the surface weighted MRT is the
average temperature of the selected surface and zone averaged MRT and is
intended to represent conditions in the limit as a person gets closer and
closer to a particular surface. In that limit, half of the person?s radiant
field will be dominated by that surface and the other half will be exposed
to the rest of the zone. Note that the surface weighted MRT is only an
approximation. The angle factor MRT is the mean temperature of the
surrounding surface temperatures weighted according to the magnitude of the
respective angle factors and allows the user to more accurately predict
thermal comfort at a particular location within a space."

Meanwhile, the effective temperature of the screen/glazing combination that
is used to calculate the window?s contribution to the zone?s mean radiant
temperature (MRT) is calculated with respect only to long wave radiation.
Therefore I believe the mean radiant temperature calculation for energy +
does not take into account direct solar radiation through the window.

To my understanding, "a person standing near a window" is the exceptional
case when indoor thermal comfort calculation, such as Fanger's model, is
implemented. Please bear in mind, those indoor thermal comfort equations are
normally based upon extensive indoor survey results and the survey were
unlikely carried out in extreme conditions, such as under direct solar
radiation. Fortunately. many outdoor thermal models are developing recently
(i.e. http://www.urbanclimate.net/matzarakis/papers/Radiation_6hellenic.pdf).
You may try to explain your scenario with respect to these models.

A good paper regarding calculation of MRT outdoors can be found at
http://www.gvc2.gu.se/Ngeo/bjorn/pdf/referee/12%20-%20Thorsson%20et%20al%202007.pdf

  1. M&E Rooms, Restrooms, storage & Thermal zoning
     (Jaigath Chandraprakash)
Hi Jaigath

I think you can simulate M&E rooms, or restrooms and other as unconditioned
zone.

One points is the exhaust ventilation can take the internal heat outside.
For example, in the M&E room, there is some devices which are emitting heat
into air.
If you simulate them as uncondictioned, I think you'd better remove the
internal heat gain (lighting, equipment, and other).

The main affect that you simulate them as unconditioned zone is: the air
temperature will be higher than real conditioned, and the heat exchange
between these unconditioned zones and air-conditioned zone will increase a
little. However, this should be very small..

Ross and all,

 

The one tool I'm aware of that does account for solar radiation (direct,
diffuse, and, if I recall, reflected) striking occupants within a
building is the Advanced Human Thermal Comfort Model from the Center for
the Built Environment at UC Berkeley. The following web page on the CBE
site has information regarding this tool, its development, and a number
of related topics:

 

http://www.cbe.berkeley.edu/research/briefs-thermmodel.htm

 

This tool was used in developing a method that may form the basis for a
future National Fenestration Rating Council (NFRC) window comfort rating
method, useful to designers, manufacturers, and consumers. Information
regarding this project and a detailed 91-page technical paper on the
topic are available from the CBE on the following page:

 

http://www.cbe.berkeley.edu/research/facade_comfort.htm

 

I highly recommend the technical papers on the page and the previous
one. I hope you find this helpful.

 

Regards,

Timothy

DirectSolar Gain

 

Hi Ross, 

 

According to Energy Plus engineeringreference " There are three options
to calculate mean radiant temperature in the thermal comfort models. One
is the zone averaged MRT, another is the surface weighted MRT, and the
other is angle factor MRT. The zone averaged MRT is calculated on the
assumption that a person is in the center of a space, whereas the
surface weighted MRT is calculated in consideration of the surface that
a person is closest to, and the angle factor MRT is calculated based on
angle factors between a person and the different surfaces in a space.
Here, the surface weighted MRT is the average temperature of the
selected surface and zone averaged MRT and is intended to represent
conditions in the limit as a person gets closer and closer to a
particular surface. In that limit, half of the person's radiant field
will be dominated by that surface and the other half will be exposed to
the rest of the zone. Note that the surface weighted MRT is only an
approximation. The angle factor MRT is the mean temperature of the
surrounding surface temperatures weighted according to the magnitude of
the respective angle factors and allows the user to more accurately
predict thermal comfort at a particular location within a space." 

 

Meanwhile, the effective temperature of the screen/glazing combination
that is used to calculate the window's contribution to the zone's mean
radiant temperature (MRT) is calculated with respect only to long wave
radiation. Therefore I believe the mean radiant temperature calculation
for energy + does not take into account direct solar radiation through
the window. 

 

To my understanding, "a person standing near a window" is the
exceptional case when indoor thermal comfort calculation, such as
Fanger's model, is implemented. Please bear in mind, those indoor
thermal comfort equations are normally based upon extensive indoor
survey results and the survey were unlikely carried out in extreme
conditions, such as under direct solar radiation. Fortunately. many
outdoor thermal models are developing recently (i.e. 
http://www.urbanclimate.net/matzarakis/papers/Radiation_6hellenic.pdf).
You may try to explain your scenario with respect to these models. 

 

A good paper regarding calculation of MRT outdoors can be found at 
http://www.gvc2.gu.se/Ngeo/bjorn/pdf/referee/12%20-%20Thorsson%20et%20al
%202007.pdf

	Hi All,

	 

	Does anyone know if the for mean radiant temperature calculation

	If not, how could this be accounted for in thermal comfort?
Results from a person standing near a window could be quite misleading
if the direct solar gain is not taken into account.

Hi Sambhav,

My understanding is system cooling load > building cooling load.


The building cooling load consists of heat transferred through the building
envelope (external loads) and heat generated by occupants, equipment, and
lights (internal loads). Meanwhile, the cooling load on any building
consists of both sensible and latent load components.



The system cooling load consists of the required cooling capacity to meet
the building cooling loads as well as possible heat gain and lost within the
system. Use traditional air source system as an example, one has to take
into account the sensible and latent loads due to ventilation, leakage
losses in the return air ducts and heat added due to return air fan (if
any).



Does it answer your question? Or you are asking about the difference in
specific simulation program?

Cheney

I would tell exactly where it is, but going by memory only, it should be in
the ASHRAE HANDBOOK "REFRIGERATION VOLUME", again I do not remember what
section of that handbook, it definitely is in there.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] District Thermal Energy
Message-ID: <4cff7e19.0189970a.5a27.24e6@mx.google.com>

Hi Friends,

 

 

I am doing a District thermal energy model (referring DTE in LEED NC ver 2.2
and LEED for schools ver 1.0, May 28, 2008). 

 

It includes step-1 (proposed and baseline) and step-2 (proposed and
baseline) eQuest models.

 

There is no space heating in the actual design.

 

The HVAC system types are as per the following:

 

*	Step-1:

*	Proposed Case: Chilled water meter, AHU as single zone reheat with
electric heat pump as heat source (But there is no space heating in the
actual design) and zone heat source not installed. And FCUs modeled as FCUs
with with electric heat pump as heat source (But there is no space heating
in the actual design) and zone heat source not installed.

 

*	Baseline Case: Chilled water meter, AHU as single zone reheat with
electric heat pump as heat source (But there is no space heating in the
actual design) and zone heat source not installed. And FCUs modeled as FCUs
with electric heat pump as heat source (But there is no space heating in the
actual design) and zone heat source not installed.

 

*	Step-2:

*	Proposed Case: Complete on site Chiller plant with cooling tower and
primary secondary pumping, AHU as single zone reheat with electric heat pump
as heat source (But there is no space heating in the actual design) and zone
heat source not installed. And FCUs modeled as FCUs with electric heat pump
as heat source (But there is no space heating in the actual design) and zone
heat source not installed.

 

*	Baseline Case: AHU as packaged single zone and FCU as PTAC as per
the document District Thermal Energy in LEED NC ver 2.2 and LEED for schools
ver 1.0, May 28, 2008. Heating by electric heat pump. We have also modeled
PTAC cooling EIR and heating EIR as per ASHRAE 90.1-2004

 

Step-1 Baseline: 

*	Total heating load  (SS-D command) = -64.29 MBTU
*	Total heating energy consumption (from the output) = 18.8 * 10^3 kWh

 

Step-2 Baseline: 

*	Total heating load  (SS-D command) = -94.747 MBTU
*	Total heating energy consumption (from the output) = 49.5 * 10^3 kWh

 

The issue is:

 

Q-1: Why the heating loads in the step-1 and step-2 are not consistent?
(Where as in the step-1 and step-2 proposed cases the heating loads hence
the energy consumptions are consistent)

 

Please note that all other parameters are same in both step-1 and step-2
baseline models.

Hello all,

I have a question about occupancy schedules for energy models.

Generally the owner will provide peak occupancy numbers on a room-by-room basis; and a peak overall occupancy number for the entire building. Inevitably the room-by-room numbers will add up to significantly more than the overall building number.

Which numbers should be used for the energy model? Would you use the room-by-room number and scale them down with the occupancy schedule based on the overall occupancy?

Obviously, this has a significant impact on the results.

Thanks,

I typically apply an hourly fraction to each space occupancy whereby space
peak values would not coincide at the same hour, and if they do, they should
match the building overall count for the building. Similar to how you would
calculate external gains by exposure.

Thanks for sharing Alex =).

 

Regarding that concern I voiced between visible and other wavelengths... I dug a little and found a resource supporting the notion.  See the color chart near the bottom of the following link that plots water absorption coefficients against the electromagnetic wavelength spectrum - visible light is absorbed by water much less than other wavelength ranges.  http://www.lsbu.ac.uk/water/vibrat.html

 

Again, I brought this up for two purposes:  To suggest a reason why the DOE2 help files list an albedo of 0.05 for the ocean (unqualified with a frequency range like "visible light," 'albedo' generally refers to the full electromagnetic spectrum), and as a reason to caution that a majority of the sun's energy which might otherwise produce a solar heat gain on a building envelope may fall outside the visible range, and thus would be subtracted out of what's reflected to your building if you're talking about a body of water.  Again, I'm no physicist but I know enough to suggest caution.

 

If you're modeling daylighting controls, the lake could certainly be modeled as a surface with a reflectance in the 90%+ range at low incident angles (sunrise/sunset), but if you're trying to account for additional envelope thermal loads reflected from a lake, I think your albedo figure should never fall in that range (unless, again, the lake is covered with snow), and that figure further might not vary appreciably with the incident angle... 

 

***

 

Calculating seasonal sun angles for a specific latitude/longitude as a separate topic can be a tricky business - but there a number of free and for-cost tools that do all the legwork for you.  

 

Here's one example of a free, simplistic tool to get angles at a specific time/location:  http://solardat.uoregon.edu/SolarPositionCalculator.html

 

A tangent tip: you can right-click anywhere in google maps and select "what's here" from the context menu to get the exact latitude and longitude for your location.

Hi Nick,

 

Thanks for the in depth response (as always!).

 

I'm working off of this website: http://www.atmosphere.mpg.de/enid/3rv.html 

Which shows how reflectance of water changes with the sun's angle.

 

The late afternoon sun (in winter) could have reflectance of as much as 35%... It looks like late afternoon in summer just doesn't have that high of sun angles which I found surprising.

 

I'm still trying to get my head around the whole thing, but figured I'd share the link with you.

 

In my readings I didn't see where it said that water would absorb infrared while reflecting visible wavelengths. Working with glass and Low-E coatings, I have some idea of how different wavelengths interact differently with different materials (but I'm also not an astrophysicist). In any case, it's been interesting reading people's viewpoints on this one. 

 

Cheers,

Alex

Hey Alex,

 

I hate to muddy the waters further, but I'm pretty sure the visible light spectrum (a small band of the sun's energy) does not behave identically to the rest of the electromagnetic spectrum regarding how much energy is reflected for a given incidence angle on water...  

 

To voice my concern another way:  sunlight bounced from a lake in the morning/evening may well effectively double the amount of visible light energy incident on a building fa?ade for a certain hour, but this would likely not result in a corresponding doubled thermal solar load - energy at frequencies above/below the visible light spectrum may be more prone to simply dive into the lake...

 

I understand the term 'albedo' in the context of collected weather data / energy modeling generally refers to the full spectrum of the sun's energy (light inclusive), and you might trip yourself up by assuming terrestrial surface albedo is the same thing as surface reflectivity, for light.  

 

(good catch-up reading with examples:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo)

 

Water bodies do have a really low albedo - not because they do not reflect light, but mostly because they suck up the rest of the electromagnetic spectrum really well.  If on the other hand your lake freezes and is covered with snow during the winter, I'd expect the sun's full spectrum of energy to bounce much more effectively to your cozy lakehouse =). 

 

PS:  I am no astro-physicist, nor am I a meteorologist... I'm only throwing out some cautions/thoughts from what I've picked up here and there on the topic...

So changing it to 0.05 to try to account for the reflectance of the water, would actually decrease the reflected solar heat... 

 

Hmmm. I'll play with some different values in eQUEST and see how much ground reflectance impacts consumption, and keep in mind the 0.05 value.

 

Thanks for everyone's quick and thoughtful responses.

The default ground reflectance is 0.20. You have to enter a different value for it to appear in the inp file.

Subject: RE: [Equest-users] Ground/Water reflectance

 

The albedo of an ocean should probably equal that of a lake on an average basis throughout the day (not a peak hourly basis).  The radiation reflected by water is very low when the incident wave is perpendicular to the surface of the water, and it approaches 100% as the angle of incidence approaches 90 degrees (morning and evening).  As the waves move through the water the incident angle of each zone of water will vary from 0-90 degrees on a constant basis and the reflectance should roughly average out to equal that of a still body of water.  

For a lake, in the late afternoon, the reflectance will increase from 0.05 to 0.1 or 0.2.   Later in the evening it will reach closer to 0.8 or 0.9, but at this time the radiation intensity from the sun drops off significantly.

To model the lake on one side is a challenge, your peak loads may not change but your annual consumption may.   If eQuest uses the gnd reflectance values as a multiplier of solar radiation, it may be worth running a few iterations with different values of gnd reflectance to see the results.

Thanks Bill and John for your responses. 

 

I guess I would expect that the ocean would be a bit more "turbid" (seems appropriate) - but what about for buildings facing a lake or harbor where the water is calmer? Perhaps the additional reflected solar gain is negligible, but my gut tells me that is not the case. 

 

This project is a retrofit and they talked of having intense heat along the facades facing the water. Perhaps it's more due to the tinted single-pane glass that gets hot (?) but my initial thought was the water is the culprit.

 

Is it possible to create a 2d shape in the ground plane south of the building, and apply the reflectance to that, or do I need to apply it to the whole ground?

 

I looked through a previous project and didn't see the term "GND-REFLECTANCE" anywhere in the inp or pd2 files. Is the default to have a ground-reflectance of 0? If so, I guess I'll run one case with 0, and one with 0.05... although I doubt there will be much difference between the two.


Thanks again - any other thoughts on this are much appreciated.

 

Kind regards,

Alex,

 

Exterior surfaces have a "Ground reflectance" property - GND-REFLECTANCE, accessible through the Daylighting - Shading - Other tab of the exterior surface. Reading the DOE-2 Help description, the reflectance value for "ocean" is 0.05, implying that most solar radiation is absorbed, not reflected. I'm guessing that the visual glare we perceive does not increase the solar load as much as we would think. Sea monsters do not seem to have been considered by the DOE-2 team.

Bill

I wonder if the turbidity (word ??) of the water will actually not make a difference. Any harbor will have boats, wind effects, and an occasional sea monster disturbing the "glass" water.

Hello everyone,

 

I've got a building that is located at the edge of a harbor with the water directly to the south of it. How do I model a reflective surface on the ground that represents the harbor? I feel this is key to include, as this reflectivity will send additional heat through the windows. I looked through the archives but didn't see anything related to ground reflectivity.

 

If anyone knows how to create reflective objects and/or an appropriate value of reflectivity for water in eQUEST, that would be most helpful.

 

Thanks in advance!

This is a very important point that is often forgotten in simulation
modeling. The computer is a strange object and if you tell the computer
to put one occupant for every 100ft2, then is does just that and the
related ventilation air and cooling (or heating).

I usually request the architect provide me with the occupation
calculations for the elevators and cafeteria and also the Fire Marshall
rating for building occupancy. These numbers are typically around 70% of
the simulation program occupants. The occupancy density in the program
and therefore be adjusted to match this.

How this could be interpreted in 90.1 I will leave up to any following
discussions?

Hello all,

 

I have a question about occupancy schedules for energy models.

 

Generally the owner will provide peak occupancy numbers on a
room-by-room basis; and a peak overall occupancy number for the entire
building. Inevitably the room-by-room numbers will add up to
significantly more than the overall building number.

 

Which numbers should be used for the energy model? Would you use the
room-by-room number and scale them down with the occupancy schedule
based on the overall occupancy?

 

Obviously, this has a significant impact on the results.

 

Thanks,

The topic is kind of broad but I'll take a swing:

 

-          The ideal "100% occupied" figures and scheduling to use are
those describing actual occupancy in an existing/future building.  In
the real world, energy modelers generally can't get ahold of this
information for new construction.  Real-world scheduling may be readily
available for schools and the like, however.

 

-          The best "100% occupied" occupancy numbers in lieu of "real
world" would be those already used to develop the HVAC design loads - at
the minimum you know the modeled equipment capacities/airflows will be
sufficient for the resultant interior/ventilation loads.  Your architect
may or may not be the person to talk to to get this information.

 

-          When the mechanical designer's ventilation/occupancy figures
aren't handy either... a fire plan's space/exit capacity figures, while
inflated to a worst case for life safety purposes, might be okay in a
pinch if you don't have time to develop your own figures, but given
time...

 

-          ...I would sooner develop my own numbers (play the part of
the missing ME) using the furniture plans and occupancy density figures
(P/1000SF) per ASHRAE Std 62/62.1.  Such figures are often built into
load calc and energy modeling programs for the user's convenience, and
those are a good starting point to refine/round using other resources at
hand.

 

90.1 Appendix G is (thankfully) fairly simple and "hands-off" when it
comes to how occupancy/scheduling should be handled.  As long as
everything is identical between baseline and proposed, everyone on the
reviewer side should be happy, so the means by which we approximate
maximum occupancies and hourly fractional scheduling is pretty much up
to the modelers.  This is one of those "self-policing" approaches within
90.1:  Skewing the occupancy/scheduling too far in either direction is
not in the best interest for a LEED model, as you will either (A) have
an overly-vacant building with fewer loads for your more-efficient
systems to handle, decreasing the building performance %, or (B) have an
over-occupied building resulting in loads that cause unmet hours the
proposed equipment capacities can't handle.

This is a very important point that is often forgotten in simulation
modeling. The computer is a strange object and if you tell the computer
to put one occupant for every 100ft2, then is does just that and the
related ventilation air and cooling (or heating).

I usually request the architect provide me with the occupation
calculations for the elevators and cafeteria and also the Fire Marshall
rating for building occupancy. These numbers are typically around 70% of
the simulation program occupants. The occupancy density in the program
and therefore be adjusted to match this.

How this could be interpreted in 90.1 I will leave up to any following
discussions?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Occupancy

 

Hello all,

 

I have a question about occupancy schedules for energy models.

 

Generally the owner will provide peak occupancy numbers on a
room-by-room basis; and a peak overall occupancy number for the entire
building. Inevitably the room-by-room numbers will add up to
significantly more than the overall building number.

 

Which numbers should be used for the energy model? Would you use the
room-by-room number and scale them down with the occupancy schedule
based on the overall occupancy?

 

Obviously, this has a significant impact on the results.

 

Thanks,

Hello all,


The ?best case scenario? is to match the room-by-room peak occupancy numbers
with the total building ones by adjusting hourly schedules which would be
fairly complicated to ensure the total building occupants can be distributed
in different rooms but remain the same all the time.



In reality, the objectives of estimating either room-by-room peak numbers or
overall building numbers vary according to disciplines. Architects may have
concerns over spatial constrain while mechanical engineers will worry about
system size, peak loads and energy requirements. When it comes to modeling,
my understanding is to see the issue mainly from mechanical design point of
view:



   - The room-by-room peak occupancy numbers govern ventilation rate and
   size of cooling system. Managing to ask mechanical designers to verify the
   numbers provided by architects and running the load calculation with respect
   to these numbers.
   - On the other hand, the overall building numbers, as one of internal
   heat sources, have impact on the overall building energy requirements.
   Architects or building owners may have better idea of how many they would be
   and there is little room to change the figures by engineers. Running energy
   simulation with respect to these numbers. Scale the room-by-room numbers
   down to match the overall building numbers is acceptable at this point.

Cheney

Message-ID: <AC125FB7-E2A7-4A57-9091-E37462DE87D1@gmail.com>

A bit of mid week trivia.

A single zone, dual system equest scenario supplied by radiant slab  
(heat/cool) AND displacement ventilation.

How does this approach sound:

- dummy zone, 100% oa, reduced kw/ton, reduced floor-to-ceiling  
(oversize plenum)

- add baseboard

- ideas for adding radiant cool? already used my the one main system i  
get per zone for displacement, otherwise could run chilled water thru  
zones airside, turn down fan again

Thoughts?

Thanks everyone!

A large water surface means little shading - combined with tinted large 
glazing, sounds hot, yes ;-)

I know nothing about your software. Your reflectance values still appear 
to be very low. 0.05 is more or less black in my understanding. For 
water, I'd assume albedos between 0.05 and 0.20. For dry ground, typical 
albedos are 0.20-0.30, snow e.g. can go up to 0.90.

Cheers, Lars.

Message-ID: <011401cb97f2$7c3b6c20$74b24460$@com>

Hi,

Does anyone have an Excel-friendly equation they would be willing to share
that can convert Tdb and RH into Twb?  We have metered data giving us Tdb,
RH, and Tdp, but we need to know wetbulb.  We usually solve this problem
with an Excel psychrometric add-in, but we need to distribute this
spreadsheet to a client and cannot distribute the add-in at the same time.

 

We've tried a couple of multivariable regressions on the data, but because
it is nonlinear, it is not proving to be that straightforward.  Next stop
might be a two-way lookup table, but that is kind of cumbersome and was
hoping to avoid it.

 

Any help much appreciated.

 

Sincerely,
Alec Stevens

You should be able to find these routines in the HVAC Toolkit book - sold by
ashrae. I don't have it handy so not sure if you can use the routine
directly in excel - you might need visual basic. I have done this previously
in matlab, C++

Alec:

In the past, I wrote two programs in Turbo Pascal that calculates
thermal properties of moist air based on ASHRAE equations.  They are
called PSY and PSY2.  PSY2 takes values of Dry-bulb and Relative
Humidity under a particular pressure condition (in.Hg) and returns all
properties of that air including Relative Humidity.

I will attempt to send this PSY2.exe file but our university email
system blocks any .exe files from being sent over their system.  So I
will remove the .exe from the file and you can re-name it later.  You
can also try to unzip the attached PSY2.exe file.

If it doesn't work, let me know, and I will send it through other email
accounts to you directly.  You may also try to download it from my
website: http://houseenergydoctor.arizona.edu

Subject: [Bldg-sim] PTAC should add DOAS?
Message-ID: <000601cb9880$a92b8ab0$fb82a010$@com>

Dear all

       I am doing LEED-CS energy rating simulation. Part of the project is
residential type and the HVAC system for baseline is PTAC and the proposed
system is FCU+DOAs. However the PTAC system has no outdoor air and the
energy consumption of PTAC without DOAs in baseline is less than the
proposed building. So I think the PTAC system should add DOAs. 

Has anyone performed the PTAC system simulation and agree with my opinion?

Look forward to reply! Thank you very much!

Why does the PTAC not have any outdoor air?  Each PTAC should have
outside air - usually you want that rate to either be the ASHRAE 62.1
requirements, or match the proposed (there has been a lot of contention
about which, so I'd play it safe and use the ASHRAE 62.1 values).  You
don't want to add DOAS to the baseline PTACs, as that is not how
Appendix G tells you to create the baseline system.  Just assign OA to
each PTAC.

Hi All,

Has anyone out there every come across data for the heat gain of children (for cooling load calcs)? I searched the ASHRAE handbooks but didnt find anything, just the usual numbers for adults in the thermal comfort chapter. My current thought is to use the adult numbers adjusted by mass, but if there's real data that'd be great. Any hints would be appreciated.

In the Ashrae fundamentals handbook there is a table of heat gains from
people at different activity levels  in the non residential heating and
cooling loads chapter( Chapter 18 of the  2009 version).  Children should be
calculated at 75% of the adult male heat gain value per that table, it has
been in the ASHRAE handbook for years.

Cramer, from my old days of studying thermal comfort I seem to remember
a correlation between heat output and body area. I seem to remember that
average adults have a body area of 1.68m2 that produce 70W of sensible
heat. So if the body area of a child is less than the 1.68m2 then the
heat output can be reduced proportionally. I think this is report in
Thermal Comfort by Fanger, 1972

Hi All,

Has anyone out there every come across data for the heat gain of
children (for cooling load calcs)? I searched the ASHRAE handbooks but
didnt find anything, just the usual numbers for adults in the thermal
comfort chapter. My current thought is to use the adult numbers adjusted
by mass, but if there's real data that'd be great. Any hints would be
appreciated.

It seems to me that correlating a child's body area  with heat loss as a
direct ratio of an adults heat loss would not account for the significantly
higher metabolic rate that children have.  Remember there are various heat
loss values published for adults depending on their activity level.

Message-ID: <8A8D4AA0D695D14BB8D858982739C51E0D3FF94339@irec-ex>

Dear all,

I am trying to calculate the heating loads of a residential tower using DOE 2.1E, and I'm having some trouble.

Here is what I want:


-       Hourly values of heating load of a residential tower. i.e., "heat" that the system must supply to keep the temperature setpoint

-       The load values should correspond to a building in which (in addition to occupancy and plug loads) the setpoint temperature changes according to a schedule defined by me (since it is a residential building, the temperature setpoint would drop when occupants are at work or sleeping)

This is the problem I have:


-       According to the DOE manual, the values of the "loads" report are based on the assumption that the space is kept at a constant temperature (the default is 74F, but can be changed)

-       The manual also says that the "loads" are corrected in the "systems" calculation. The "loads" report in the "systems" section provides values that (in many hours of the year) differ from those in the "loads" report in the "loads section". However, I think these may be adjusted to account for the heat gains, but they are not adjusted according to the temperature setpoint schedule.

Finally, these are my questions:

-       Is there a variable in either the "loads" of "systems" section that corresponds to what I'm looking for?

-       If not, is there a way to simulate an "ideal" system (if so, I could use its energy (fuel) use)

-       Any general comments on this?

Thanks so much in advance for your help!!

Yours,

Eduard

Agreed, but the metabolic rate can be adjusted in proportion to the body
area. If you use the new ASHRAE 55 thermal comfort you can run all the
different metabolic scenarios and adjust these for different body areas.

I feel like I've seen this question asked before, but couldn't find it
in the archives.

 

Does anyone know if there is a tool that can extract a TMY file (or EPW
file) to excel, then allow adjustments to the excel spreadsheet, and can
then recompile back to TMY or EPW or BIN?

 

I basically need to make a custom weather file based on a weather
station.

 

Thanks, and sorry if this question has already been asked!

Hi James,

I usually use Ecotect Weather tool to do what you mentioned
here. Alternatively, TAS can edit weather data directly in its module. My
experience is that try not to convert weather file into excel and compile
back since errors may occur easily in the process.

Cheney

Answer:               I?m not sure that you can unpack a bin file, but you
can go to NREL (or EnergyPlus?) webpages to get the original TMY, TMY2, or
TMY3 data which are all editable in a spreadsheet.  The EPW format is
already comma separated variable, so edit away!  The ?native? TMY format is
also editable in comma separated variable, although you?ll need to get the
dictionary from NREL?s page as well to interpret the values.



Use these instructions to recompile into the eQuest *.bin format.



http://doe2.com/index_Wth.html



Question:            Now that I answered one, I have a question for the
group:  using the EnergyPlus real-time weather utility ? it seems to be not
working lately?  Has this site moved, or is it currently inactive?

  Apologies for cross-posting.

The complete announcement can be found here:
http://www.idlboise.com/node/149

The University of Idaho, Integrated Design Lab-Boise (IDL) is running a 
three-day EnergyPlus workshop in Feb 14 -16, 2011.

Objectives

The aim of this workshop is to equip designers and engineers with the 
technical skills to be able to perform building simulation using Energy 
Plus and understand how to use the tool as part of the Integrated Design 
Process. Note the emphasis on the Integrated Design Process, which means 
that the focus is on how to use simulation to design high performance 
buildings. This also means that the workshop will not focus on using 
simulation for compliance, be it code compliance or beyond-code 
compliance (e.g. LEED), however this type of simulation will be covered 
briefly.

We have received many inputs, comments and criticism from our survey. Do 
not forget to read the summary of these inputs in the EnergyPlus

The workshop is designed in the form of a la carte menu such that 
participants can choose topics based on their needs and interests. Day 1 
and Day 2 is relevant to architects and mechanical engineers with little 
or no experience with Energy Plus. A mechanical engineer with a basic 
understanding of EnergyPlus will likely be interested in Day 2 and Day 
3. Of course there is no restrictions at all to take any single day or 
all three days however there will be very little time to address 
questions covered during a previous day. There is very little content 
overlap between days.

Day 1 is about the basics and nuts and bolts of EnergyPlus. The whole 
simulation process is introduced in a step by step manner, from geometry 
development to result analysis. The main tools described are the 
OpenStudio plugin for SketchUp as the geometry modeler and of course the 
EnergyPlus as the calculation engine. Other, more advanced, tools are 
also introduced, for example the use of scripts to run multiple 
simulations and result extraction. At the end of Day 1, participants 
will be able to develop an input file for and get results from basic 
EnergyPlus simulations.

Day 2 is about how to use simulation appropriately and how to 
communicate results within the integrated design process and for 
compliance purposes. The first section is how to use EnergyPlus to 
support integrated design processes for high performance buildings. 
Several passive design strategies will be discussed: daylighting, 
thermal mass, and night flush. This section focuses on loads analysis 
and detailed active systems are not included at this stage. This allows 
designers to get necessary information in order to inform passive design 
decisions. The second part of the day is how to use EnergyPlus for 
compliance, be it code compliance or beyond-code compliance. The 
division into these two main sections is intentional and highlights the 
different functions of building performance simulation. At the end of 
Day 2, participants will be able to develop a series of EnergyPlus 
simulations for performance analysis in support of passive design and 
the integrated design process as well as documenting the results for 
compliance purposes.

Day 3 is about HVAC systems definition. In the first two days, the HVAC 
system definition will rely on (two) HVAC templates available in 
EnergyPlus, an automated definition of HVAC systems. In day 3, the rest 
of the EnergyPlus HVAC templates will be discussed. Furthermore, manual 
development of HVAC systems without the template will be discussed. A 
number of examples are used: water source heat pump, ground source heat 
pump, and hybrid system.

Dear Jeff,

Where might one find this report and the spreadsheets?  I searched the
ASHRAE Web site for RP865 and came up empty.

ASHRAE also has wetbulb formula in the spreadsheets that come with the
ASHRAE RP865 final report, which are being incorporated into Standard 140.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] wetbulb formula

Hi,
Does anyone have an Excel-friendly equation they would be willing to share
that can convert Tdb and RH into Twb?  We have metered data giving us Tdb,
RH, and Tdp, but we need to know wetbulb.  We usually solve this problem
with an Excel psychrometric add-in, but we need to distribute this
spreadsheet to a client and cannot distribute the add-in at the same time.

We've tried a couple of multivariable regressions on the data, but because
it is nonlinear, it is not proving to be that straightforward.  Next stop
might be a two-way lookup table, but that is kind of cumbersome and was
hoping to avoid it.

Any help much appreciated.

Sincerely,
Alec Stevens

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=19naYBwdr8+97-LHR+boN0K_D=dJRRdfig4CS@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,
           In Appendix G Table G3.1 Page 178 Paragraph 11 about
Service hot water heaters it is written

The service hot-water system in the baseline building design shall use the same
energy source as the corresponding system in the proposed design and
shall conform
with the following conditions:

a. Where the complete service hot-water system exists, the baseline building
design shall reflect the actual system type using the actual component
capacities
and efficiencies.

b. Where a new service hot-water system has been specified, the system shall
be sized according to the provisions of Section 7.4.1 and the equipment shall
match the minimum efficiency requirements in Section 7.4.2..

I didnt get what is difference between a and b

Suppose if we are showing energy saving between baseline and proposed
case through solar heaters which are installed in proposed Case then
what heater shall we take in baseline (Electric? Gas ) and which
should be its efficiency and Baseline thermal conductivity of Storage
tank

Thanks
Sambhav

I am an eQuest user and am looking into IES-VE as an eventual
replacement.  I am curious if anyone has been through a comparison like
this before and would be willing to share their opinions.  I know there
has been some discussion about this in the past, but it looks like most
of the discussions are a few years old.  I want to make sure I am not
discounting IES-VE for problems that have been fixed.
 
The draw of IES-VE is the compatibility with revit and its ability to
do more than just energy or daylighting.  It seems like having all of
the analysis tools in one program would be very useful.
 
>From reading through the archives, the drawbacks of this program are
the cost and that IES doesn't allow the user as much flexibility as
eQuest of Energy Plus.  Can IES-VE generate the hourly reports that
eQuest and Energy Plus can?
 
Please let me know what your thoughts are on these programs.  I also
hear rumors of AutoDesk jumping into the mix with Project Vasari and
Labs.  Does anyone know more about this?
 
Thanks,
Tim

Hi James,
I'm sure there are a lot of ways to convert between .epw and excel.? This is one 
way that works:
1.? Open your EPW as a CSV in Excel.
2.? Make the desired edits,?such as?plugging in your weather station data.? 
(Even if you're not using EnergyPlus, the Auxiliary EnergyPlus Programs manual 
will explain the components of the EPW file.)
3.? Save the file as a CSV.? I usually save only the header first, deleting the 
body.? Then only the body, deleting the header.? Otherwise,?you end up with a 
lot of extra commas in the header.? This?method is quicker than deleting the 
commas.
4.? Then I open the files in Textpad or Notepad and combine the header and body 
and make sure everything looks OK.? Then save it. CSV or TXT format is fine.
5.? Then I manually change the file name from .txt?or .csv to .epw.
6.? Then?the EPW file?works in EnergyPlus.? I'm assuming it would work in other 
programs as well.? As long as all the values?are OK?I haven't had any problems 
with conversions.

As an alternative, you can use the EnergyPlus Weather Tool to compile custom 
data into an EPW format.? 

Hope this helps.

I feel like I've seen this question asked before, but couldn't find it
in the archives.



Does anyone know if there is a tool that can extract a TMY file (or EPW
file) to excel, then allow adjustments to the excel spreadsheet, and can
then recompile back to TMY or EPW or BIN?



I basically need to make a custom weather file based on a weather
station.



Thanks, and sorry if this question has already been asked!

Hi James,

I usually use Ecotect Weather tool to do what you mentioned
here. Alternatively, TAS can edit weather data directly in its module. My
experience is that try not to convert weather file into excel and compile
back since errors may occur easily in the process.

Cheney

Answer:? ? ? ? ? ? ? I?m not sure that you can unpack a bin file, but you
can go to NREL (or EnergyPlus?) webpages to get the original TMY, TMY2, or
TMY3 data which are all editable in a spreadsheet.? The EPW format is
already comma separated variable, so edit away!? The ?native? TMY format is
also editable in comma separated variable, although you?ll need to get the
dictionary from NREL?s page as well to interpret the values.



Use these instructions to recompile into the eQuest *.bin format.



http://doe2.com/index_Wth.html



Question:? ? ? ? ? ? Now that I answered one, I have a question for the
group:? using the EnergyPlus real-time weather utility ? it seems to be not
working lately?? Has this site moved, or is it currently inactive?

A 5' 8" tall 154 lb male surface area is 19.6 s.f. (Du Bois) and
produces about 400 Btu/hr (117 W) at seated at rest.

Maybe you can do the math

The University of Idaho, Integrated Design Lab-Boise (IDL) is running a 
three-day EnergyPlus workshop in Feb 14 -16, 2011.

Objectives

The aim of this workshop is to equip designers and engineers with the 
technical skills to be able to perform building simulation using Energy 
Plus and understand how to use the tool as part of the Integrated Design 
Process. Note the emphasis on the Integrated Design Process, which means 
that the focus is on how to use simulation to design high performance 
buildings. This also means that the workshop will not focus on using 
simulation for compliance, be it code compliance or beyond-code 
compliance (e.g. LEED), however this type of simulation will be covered 
briefly.

We have received many inputs, comments and criticism from our survey. Do 
not forget to read the summary of these inputs in the EnergyPlus 
Workshop FAQ page.

Syllabus Summary

The workshop is designed in the form of a la carte menu such that 
participants can choose topics based on their needs and interests. Day 1 
and Day 2 is relevant to architects and mechanical engineers with little 
or no experience with Energy Plus. A mechanical engineer with a basic 
understanding of EnergyPlus will likely be interested in Day 2 and Day 
3. Of course there is no restrictions at all to take any single day or 
all three days however there will be very little time to address 
questions covered during a previous day. There is very little content 
overlap between days.

Day 1 is about the basics and nuts and bolts of EnergyPlus. The whole 
simulation process is introduced in a step by step manner, from geometry 
development to result analysis. The main tools described are the 
OpenStudio plugin for SketchUp as the geometry modeler and of course the 
EnergyPlus as the calculation engine. Other, more advanced, tools are 
also introduced, for example the use of scripts to run multiple 
simulations and result extraction. At the end of Day 1, participants 
will be able to develop an input file for and get results from basic 
EnergyPlus simulations.

Day 2 is about how to use simulation appropriately and how to 
communicate results within the integrated design process and for 
compliance purposes. The first section is how to use EnergyPlus to 
support integrated design processes for high performance buildings. 
Several passive design strategies will be discussed: daylighting, 
thermal mass, and night flush. This section focuses on loads analysis 
and detailed active systems are not included at this stage. This allows 
designers to get necessary information in order to inform passive design 
decisions. The second part of the day is how to use EnergyPlus for 
compliance, be it code compliance or beyond-code compliance. The 
division into these two main sections is intentional and highlights the 
different functions of building performance simulation. At the end of 
Day 2, participants will be able to develop a series of EnergyPlus 
simulations for performance analysis in support of passive design and 
the integrated design process as well as documenting the results for 
compliance purposes.

Day 3 is about HVAC systems definition. In the first two days, the HVAC 
system definition will rely on (two) HVAC templates available in 
EnergyPlus, an automated definition of HVAC systems. In day 3, the rest 
of the EnergyPlus HVAC templates will be discussed. Furthermore, manual 
development of HVAC systems without the template will be discussed. A 
number of examples are used: water source heat pump, ground source heat 
pump, and hybrid system.

Detailed syllabus can be found here: http://www.idlboise.com/node/150

Tim,
We?ve recently formed an energy services group, and I wanted to employ any tool that would enhance production. The IES software is very attractive, with their new offering of a ?PRM Navigator? (LEED analysis guidance), but there are limitations you should be aware of:

1.       The software is costly

2.       At this point, it cannot handle anything other than a flat utility rate schedule, which is not real world

3.       It is not user extensible

4.       To integrate the process with Revit, you have to enforce modeling standards on architectural designers, who tend to have bad practices

5.       There are some systems which cannot be modeled, such as thermal storage (without item 2 above corrected, the benefit of thermal storage, if available, would be missed)

6.       The PRM navigator (LEED Analysis) only spins out a 90.1-2007 baseline model
Having said that, we are employing the tool to see if it does provide some benefit. The CFD analysis looks promising, and there may be additional tools (such as Trelligence) that might be of benefit that use IES, although we?ve had to switch a large project from IES to eQuest due to items 2, 5 and 6 above.  The LEED  guidance package is very nice, and it does create voluminous reports, so you can spin out results for spreadsheet analysis if desired (which is what they recommend to overcome item 2 above). There are other nice modules, which you are probably aware of as well. One thing to keep in mind, is that the IES software, while certified by the ASHRAE 140 standard, to my knowledge has not been officially acknowledged as being acceptable by GBCI.
I?m cautiously optimistic that the EnergyPlus user interface promised out in Spring (now Summer) will prove to be as useful as the eQuest  interface for DOE2. If so, then I would expect that tool to become the standard in the industry.  It is frustrating, as I  was personally involved with trying to develop an interface for EnergyPlus back before its initial release, and while it holds great promise for its extensibility, development of interfaces have been hampered by a continual change in EnergyPlus data structures. I am guessing that with this funded interface, that the process of changing data structures is less of a concern.

I know there has been some discussion about this in the past, but it looks like most of the discussions are a few years old.

From reading through the archives, the drawbacks of this program are the cost and that IES doesn't allow the user as much flexibility as eQuest of Energy Plus.  Can IES-VE generate the hourly reports that eQuest and Energy Plus can?

Please let me know what your thoughts are on these programs.  I also hear rumors of AutoDesk jumping into the mix with Project Vasari and Labs.  Does anyone know more about this?

Dear,

I am looking for both a scheme of the SAP and SBEM calculation strategy,
with a main interest in the space heating and ventilation calculations. Also
the calculation strategy in detail of especially the latter two aspects are
something I would like to understand better. The general SAP document on the
bre website is the only document I found, is there some more detailed or
extended explanation, some overview ...

Thanks a lot,

Leen,

The SAP document contains the complete SAP calculation process. For SBEM 
you can look at the SBEM technical manual available from the BRE site 
(on the same page as iSBEM)

Sam -

 

If you can get the specifications for the glass layers (manufacturer and
product name) and suspended film (if applicable) from Serious Materials, you
should be able to model the product in WINDOW 5 or 6.

Tim,

We've recently formed an energy services group, and I wanted to employ
any tool that would enhance production. The IES software is very
attractive, with their new offering of a "PRM Navigator" (LEED analysis
guidance), but there are limitations you should be aware of:

1.       The software is costly

2.       At this point, it cannot handle anything other than a flat
utility rate schedule, which is not real world

3.       It is not user extensible

4.       To integrate the process with Revit, you have to enforce
modeling standards on architectural designers, who tend to have bad
practices

5.       There are some systems which cannot be modeled, such as thermal
storage (without item 2 above corrected, the benefit of thermal storage,
if available, would be missed)

6.       The PRM navigator (LEED Analysis) only spins out a 90.1-2007
baseline model

Having said that, we are employing the tool to see if it does provide
some benefit. The CFD analysis looks promising, and there may be
additional tools (such as Trelligence) that might be of benefit that use
IES, although we've had to switch a large project from IES to eQuest due
to items 2, 5 and 6 above.  The LEED  guidance package is very nice, and
it does create voluminous reports, so you can spin out results for
spreadsheet analysis if desired (which is what they recommend to
overcome item 2 above). There are other nice modules, which you are
probably aware of as well. One thing to keep in mind, is that the IES
software, while certified by the ASHRAE 140 standard, to my knowledge
has not been officially acknowledged as being acceptable by GBCI.

I'm cautiously optimistic that the EnergyPlus user interface promised
out in Spring (now Summer) will prove to be as useful as the eQuest
interface for DOE2. If so, then I would expect that tool to become the
standard in the industry.  It is frustrating, as I  was personally
involved with trying to develop an interface for EnergyPlus back before
its initial release, and while it holds great promise for its
extensibility, development of interfaces have been hampered by a
continual change in EnergyPlus data structures. I am guessing that with
this funded interface, that the process of changing data structures is
less of a concern.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] IES-VE Evaluation

 

I am an eQuest user and am looking into IES-VE as an eventual
replacement.  I am curious if anyone has been through a comparison like
this before and would be willing to share their opinions.  I know there
has been some discussion about this in the past, but it looks like most
of the discussions are a few years old.  I want to make sure I am not
discounting IES-VE for problems that have been fixed.

 

The draw of IES-VE is the compatibility with revit and its ability to do
more than just energy or daylighting.  It seems like having all of the
analysis tools in one program would be very useful.

 

>From reading through the archives, the drawbacks of this program are the
cost and that IES doesn't allow the user as much flexibility as eQuest
of Energy Plus.  Can IES-VE generate the hourly reports that eQuest and
Energy Plus can?

 

Please let me know what your thoughts are on these programs.  I also
hear rumors of AutoDesk jumping into the mix with Project Vasari and
Labs.  Does anyone know more about this?

 

Thanks,

Tim

My first thought would be "no"...both multizone (MZS) and dual-duct (DDS)
are central AHU systems that combine air flows for temperature control, I
believe the intention of the System 3 tier of comparable AHUs is to have
multiple single-zone AHUs in the baseline building.  Multizone or dual-duct
are more analogous to large central AHUs in System 7 or System 8 with many
individual thermostatic zones.



Probably the single-zone with reheat would be a better option?
Constant-volume reheat would also be analogous if there was only one zone.
It seems like the intention is to change PSZ as the original basis, into a
single-zone system served from heating and cooling plants.

 Dr Malcolm Cook is a Reader in Building Performance Modelling at Loughborough  University and works in the area of building simulation and low energy building design. His research focuses on the use of computational fluid dynamics and dynamic thermal simulation programs for modelling natural ventilation in large non-domestic buildings. He has worked on research projects funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, the Department of Health and the EU. He has completed many consultancy projects for a wide range of clients worldwide which have included design and simulation work for health care buildings, schools and modern library buildings. His work is published in over 40 conference and journal papers and has contributed to awards for innovative building design, including the RIBA presidents gold medal for practice-based architecture (2007) and the CIBSE environmental initiative of t he year award (2006). Malcolm is secretary for the CIBSE natural ventil
 ation group, vice-chairman of the CIBSE Building Simulation group and chairman of the England affiliate of the International Building Performance Simulation Association.
 This evening&rsquo;s presentation will cover the work Malcolm has undertaken during his time spent working with architects on low energy building design, with a particular focus on natural ventilation and passive cooling strategies, and the role computer simulation can play in this design process. Malcolm will talk about the simulation techniques employed, as well as the innovative passive design principles that have led to some of the UK&rsquo;s most energy efficient buildings. In addition to UK building projects, the talk but will also include work Malcolm completed as part of the design of the LEED Gold award winning Harm A. Weber Academic Center at Judson University, in Elgin, near Chicago. This building, which comprises office and library space, adopts a hybrid ventilation and cooling strategy which exploits the maximum benefit from natural ventilation before reverting to air-conditioning during the harsh winter and peak summer months. Results during the first year of o
 peration are mixed. Malcolm hopes to &lsquo;unpack&rsquo; some of these issues during the presentation.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] what HVAC system type for a building with residential
	and nonresidential?
Message-ID: <002901cb9bfe$827698c0$8763ca40$@com>

Dear all:

         My project is a 84- floor super-high building with 27 floors for
office and 47 floors for residential(hotel and apartment) and others for
retail and equipment floors. When I select baseline HVAC system I?m confused
as both the two option below sounds rational:

1)       The Note under TABLE G3.1.1A- Baseline HVAC System Types in Page
181 of ASHRAE 90.1 tells that : ?Where attributes make a building eligible
for more than one baseline system type, use the predominant condition to
determine the system type for the entire building.?

2)       The explanation in Page G-23 of ASHRAE 90.1 MANUAL tells that : ?If
a building has both residential and nonresidential spaces with their total
conditioned floor area both greater than 20,000 ft?, for instance a
residential tower with retail and restaurants at the base, then the HVAC
system type is determined separately for the residential and nonresidential
portions.?

So if I follow option 1 I should select PTAC for the whole building which I
think unsuitable. else if I follow option 2 I should select PTAC for
residential and VAV for office and others. 

Which option should I follow?

Could anyone tell me? Thanks

 

                                                        Zhiren ZHOU

Hi zhiren,

Please note ASHRAE has published addendum for your option 1. According to
Addendum W to 90.1-2007:
" Where attributes make a building eligible for more than one *baseline *system
type, use the predominant condition to determine the system type for the
entire building except as noted in Exception a to Section G3.1.1."

So there is no conflict between the two options.

Hello!

For Climate Zone 5, IECC requires a minimum insulation value of R-13 + R-7.5 c.i. for a steel framed building. If the studs are 16" on center, the thermal bridging degrades the batt R-value of 13 down to an effective R-6 c.i. which bring the total insulation value to R-13.5 c.i. Currently, I am reviewing a building with 2.5" of R-5 extruded polystyrene total an insulation value of R-12.5 c.i. However, the building wall assembly exceeds the 'Assembly Minimum' of U-value 0.064. Since IECC 2009 is the effective energy code of Massachusetts since June 30, 2010, is the insulation assembly in agreement with the Minimum Envelope Requirements if the 'Assembly Maximum' is exceeded? Any input will be much appreciated!

Regards,

Janne Kairento

Message-ID: <358F976B38137B4F8BDDCFAC73383744490EEF@R200.boxclever.local>

Hi Group,
 
I'm currently trying to model a Multifamily Residential Building in EE4
 
The suites are heated with hydronic radiant heat, have no cooling.
Corridors are pressurized with a central air handler. 
There is no additional mechanical ventilation into the suites other than
there is a passive duct between outside and behind the fridge in each
suite to provide untreated makeup air for intermittent washroom exhaust
and range hood exhaust.
The hot water is purchased from the utility provider which serves the
neighbourhood with natural gas generated hot water.
 
I'm having difficulty determining an appropriate "work around" system
configuration in EE4 for the suites. Any insight would be much
appreciated.

Janne,

R-values in the energy code tables are just for insulation materials.  The intent of the code when limiting U-factors is that you include all layers of the entire assembly, and not just the insulating materials.  This is why the U-value requirement is very seldom equal to 1/R.  What you should do is add all R-values for the insulation, skin materials on the wall, and the indoor and outdoor air film coefficients.  Then compute the U-value and see if it meets the 0.064 limit.

I believe that most of the values presented in the tables have already assumed certain bridging conditions, and that is why (repeating what I said above) the R-values for insulation materials do not usually match the inverse of the overall U-factors.  You can see this more clearly when you look at below grade walls.  Since no air film would be present, the insulation requirement is expressed as C.  The value C-0.119 inverted is R-8.4, whereas the R-value requirement is just R-7.5.  In this case, the remaining 0.9 R-value is assumed to be available from the masonry wall. 

Regards,

Janne et al,

 

Since IECC 2009 section 501.1 continues the happy tradition of
permitting one to dismiss IECC entirely and instead defer to 90.1-2007
for commercial buildings, here's my interpretation under 90.1-2007 (all
the figures should match regardless for this exercise)...

 

The prescriptive envelope option of 90.1-2007 has the same following 3
independent requirements for a steel framed wall in climate zone 5:

-          R-13 batt 

-          R-7.5 c.i.

-          Assembly Maximum U-0.064

 

The wall you're describing does not meet the prescriptive requirements
for a 'steel framed' assembly on two fronts:  The U-value exceeds the
maximum (not minimum!) of 0.064, and from what your description there's
also no batt insulation...  

 

Combining the first two steel framed requirements into an "effective
c.i." figure is an interpretation of compliance I haven't encountered...
But it would appear even by that metric that the proposed assembly falls
short from your description.

 

ON THE OTHER HAND, the envelope appears to fall neatly within the
requirements for a 'mass' wall (no batt requirement, min c.i. 11.4, max
U-0.09).  A very important nuance (re:  the 90.1 glossary and/or IECC
502.2.3) is that walls with steel framing can still be 'mass' walls.  I
did the math once under 90.1's definitions, and came away with a rule of
thumb that any assembly including a 4" brick/masonry layer = a 'mass'
wall as far as these prescriptive tables are concerned.  

 

Also to confirm Larry's hunch - The maximum assembly U-values correspond
closely to the assembly R-value you'd calculate if you added up all the
base assembly layers as detailed in 90.1 Appendix A section A3 (re:
archived discussion in the [equest-users] list if interested).

 

~Nick

 

PS: Anyone in the position of designing around or enforcing IECC should
be keenly aware of that deferral to 90.1, and should probably have the
corresponding referenced version handy as a reference.  I think you'll
find 90.1 is much more clearly organized and worded for those moments
when IECC causes raised eyebrows =).

Dear James, 

NO - excel and other spreadsheet programs put allsorts of invisible code in
place and do not carry the 0 (Zeros) as required. 

I drop the excel file into a MYSQL data base & my IT person wrote a script
to covert the data into the appropriate format for TMY.

I feel like I've seen this question asked before, but couldn't find it in
the archives.

 

Does anyone know if there is a tool that can extract a TMY file (or EPW
file) to excel, then allow adjustments to the excel spreadsheet, and can
then recompile back to TMY or EPW or BIN?

 

I basically need to make a custom weather file based on a weather station.

 

Thanks, and sorry if this question has already been asked!

The responsiveness value appears as 'R' in the space heating
calculation.

Specifically it is in the equation for Tsc (internal temperature without
heating) in Table 9b page 143 (of SAP 2009).

An unresponsive system (low R value) results in higher average
temperatures and thus greater heating load.

An R value of 1 instead of 0.5 can reduce the space heating load by 10%.

All,

First time I am seeing this in an eQUEST model, EUIs lower than
expected based on CBECS surveys.
Anyone come across seeing an EUI in the 60 to 80 range for an 80,000
sf., college building, computer labs and offices?
I know ASHRAE baseline EUIs are expected to be lower than CBECs, but
this one seems like an over-performer.

You can report the heat used by each system and you can report the 
plant heat used as well for each hour of the year.
Do you have the DOE2.1e Supplement?  You will find detailed 
instruction on how to get hourly reports at the loads, system and plant levels.

I am trying to make a schedule for the server room.  

I have heard that a server uses 100% of the energy 100% of the time.  I don't
believe it.  I've only found one web-site that said a server goes to 60% at
night.

If I have the people working 8-5, what could I put as the server schedule?

60% unoccupied and 90% occupied.  (I'm assuming that even when working, the
server doesn't run at max name plate.)

The danged server is killing my process load.

I'm not very clear what's your meaning.

It sounds like that you want to simulate a process load with different
schedule with occupancy one. You can set two different schedules   - one for
process load and one for occupancy, then assign to right one.

Is that what you want?

Dear All,

In calculating the U-values for my proposed model, I am trying to use
Table A2.3 for metal roofs. If I have an insulation with R-14 (applied

just does not make sense to me as I do not understand the relationship
between the left portion and the right portion.

Thanks in advance,

Omar, 
If it is a standing seam roof with thermal spacer blocks (between the structure and roof system) you would take the first row, where it says 'none' in the first column then interpolate between the R-11.2 and R-16.8.  If it is a metal roof without thermal spacer blocks, then there is no default assembly and you would need some tested data of the assembly.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Using Table A2.3

Dear All,

In calculating the U-values for my proposed model, I am trying to use Table A2.3 for metal roofs. If I have an insulation with R-14 (applied continously), which values do I have to select to interpolate? The table just does not make sense to me as I do not understand the relationship between the left portion and the right portion.

Thanks in advance,

dear All,

I have research in Thermal Comfort in outdoor, is there anyone have link theory of PMV (Predicted Mean Vote) related Thermal Comfort in outdoor?

and I need the software can calculate PMV from the field data (I used RH, DBT, WBT and GT), is there anyone can help me?

Appreciate for your helping

Message-ID: <89B4FB2D5DE7614EB31CD320ED5249581E822BA290@TOR-SVR-EX5.mcw.com>

Is there a way to take credit for using a VFD compressor on a chiller in EE4?

EE4 lets you define the chiller type, efficiency (COP), IPLV and capacity.

My VFD chiller has roughly the same COP at peak operation as my non-VFD chiller; however, the IPLV is much better because the performance at part load is more efficient. However, varying the IPLV of the chiller in EE4 does not appear to have any impact on the results whatsoever. Varying the COP affects things; however, varying the IPLV does not.

Thanks,

I don't believe EE4's IPLV input does anything other than generate a warning message if you don't meet minimum efficiency.  Also there is no corresponding DOE input for IPLV.  To take advantage of better part load performance you'll have to edit the EIR-FPLR (electric input ratio as a function of the part load ratio) curve fit in DOE.  See appendix A of the EE4 modelling guide for the EE4/DOE default curves.

Hope this helps,
Kyle

don't need exact values, but something reasonable for LEED.)

Hi all,

I'm trying to calculate the BTU/h of a heat pump based on the output
results. In the output files, I have the electricity usage of HVAC of J and
the COP is set to be 3.6. Is it possible to calculate the heating capacity?
I'd appreciate if you could give me some hints.

Here is some example of the output:
Date/Time Environment:Outdoor Dry Bulb [C](TimeStep) ZONE1:Zone/Sys Air
Temperature [C](TimeStep) Electricity:HVAC [J](TimeStep)
01/01  00:01:00 2.228333 21.1 455570
01/01  00:02:00 2.256667 21.1 453998.8
01/01  00:03:00 2.285 21.1 452430.3
01/01  00:04:00 2.313333 21.1 450865.6
01/01  00:05:00 2.341667 21.1 449302.7
01/01  00:06:00 2.37 21.1 447742.7

01/01  00:09:00 2.455 21.1 443082.9
01/01  00:10:00 2.483333 21.1 441536.7

Thank you.

We are going for approval for LEED Midrise Pilot for a?commercial building in

we qualify, but before we spend a lot of money on full modeling, we want to 
confirm feasibility.? 


The building is currently vacant and so produces no income.? This will be one of 
the first?LEED historic buildings in the state and has attracted a lot of 
attention. 


Ideally, we find an individual or small firm who?can help us out with this 
initial modeling now?and then with the full modeling when it is required.??We 
need the feasibility modeling?before year end.?

I have been charged with the development of a LEED energy model for a refrigerated warehouse. The design utilizes a central plant refrigeration system. The refrigeration and miscellaneous equipment may account for over 85% of the annual energy consumption. According to ASHRAE, this is all classified and process energy.

 

How can credit be realized for improved envelope and energy-efficient mechanical systems? ASHRAE has no equivalent baseline systems. Must exceptional calculation methods be used?

 

Thanks in advance!

How do you understand the note at the bottom of Table G3.1.2.9 regarding heat recovery devices?

The meaning of this note is not very clear to me.

All:

Need to refocus my eQuest sights on East Coast buildings.

Assume I have a?multi family complex that is at least?33 years old in New 
jersey. Since people in cold climates have been sensible about putting 
insulation in structures, can anyone give me guidance as to where i might find a 
source for probable insulation during that era in New Jersey?

Ohterwise, a Blessed Holiday to you and your families !!!!!

Demba,

You just have to read the two other sections of the standard that it
references, 6.5.3.1.1 in Chapter 6 and 3.1.2.10 in Appendix G, so that you
calculate your coefficient A properly. The section in Chapter 6 will make it
all much clearer to you.

Best,

Carol

Subject: [Bldg-sim] ASHRAE 90.1-2007 Fenestration Areas
Message-ID: <88DC4C3C646DD5119B0D0002A537FD681815B872@madison.corp.epstein-isi.com>

Hi all,

 

I am working on a project that has a large amount of glass. ASHRAE 90.1-2007 states this about baseline modeling for glass:

 

The fenestration area in the baseline building shall be equal to the fenestration area in the proposed building or 40% of the exterior wall, whichever is less. If it is necessary to reduce window area in the baseline building, then corresponding increases are made in the opaque walls such that the gross exterior wall area is unchanged between the proposed building and the baseline building.

 

Fenestration area in the baseline building shall be distributed among the thermal blocks and around the building in a uniform manner. In each thermal block, the fenestration area shall be equal to the window wall ratio for the baseline building (the maximum of 40% or the proposed building WWR) multiplied times the exterior wall area for the thermal block. If the thermal block has more than one exterior wall, window area is placed proportionally on each. 

 

The window area is positioned in continuous horizontal bands on each exterior wall, although the configuration of window area on each wall is not significant since neither daylighting or self shading from the building is modeled. See Figure G-D. 

 

While the prescriptive envelope requirements provide an exception for street-level, street-side vertical fenestration (e.g., store display windows), the building performance rating method does not. Window area in the baseline building is always determined as described above.

 

Based on the wordage above, I must develop the baseline model with either the same glass areas as the proposed building (essentially copying the proposed model and just updating U-values, etc.) or 40% of the exterior wall, whichever is smaller. Since I have roughly 60% of glazing, I will have to redistribute the glass into continuous horizontal bands on each exterior wall, similar to how ASHRAE 90.1-2004. However, as I began to look at the glass % of each exterior wall, I ran into a problem:

There is not enough exterior wall space to redistribute glazing to drop the percentages for each wall to 40%. Do I just reduce each wall to 40% glazing with continuous horizontal bands?

 

Thanks!

Hi Will,*

*I think your answer is here:*

The fenestration area in the baseline building shall be equal to the
fenestration area in the proposed building or 40% of the exterior wall,
whichever is less.*

Based on your table you need to reduce the window area to be 40% of the
overall wall area, making it a band as described, except for the North wall
with 0% glass as it is already less than 40%.

Happy Holidays!

Hi Will,

If I remember clearly, the continuous horizontal bands should be placed
across all orientations and even for exterior walls without window in the
proposed design. In this case, 40% window should be placed at North.

The section of the standard states "Vertical fenestration 
areas for new buildings and additions shall equal that in 
the proposed design or 40% of gross abovegrade wall area, 
whichever is smaller, and shall be distributed on each face 
of the building in the same proportions in the proposed 
design." I've always assumed that you keep all the windows 
from the proposed design and just make them smaller. In your 
example since each window would be about 2/3 the proposed size.

I think you are using the User's Manual for ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004.

In ASHRAE 90.1-2007, there is no requirement of distributing glazing in horizontal bands.

Please refer Example G-D in 2007 User's manual. (yes, Example G-D and not Figure G-D)

As Jason mentioned, you need to reduce each glazing by 2/3 or 67% (40%/60% = 67%)

Subject: [Bldg-sim] ASHRAE 90.1-2007 Fenestration Areas

Hi all,

I am working on a project that has a large amount of glass. ASHRAE 90.1-2007 states this about baseline modeling for glass:

The fenestration area in the baseline building shall be equal to the fenestration area in the proposed building or 40% of the exterior wall, whichever is less. If it is necessary to reduce window area in the baseline building, then corresponding increases are made in the opaque walls such that the gross exterior wall area is unchanged between the proposed building and the baseline building.

Fenestration area in the baseline building shall be distributed among the thermal blocks and around the building in a uniform manner. In each thermal block, the fenestration area shall be equal to the window wall ratio for the baseline building (the maximum of 40% or the proposed building WWR) multiplied times the exterior wall area for the thermal block. If the thermal block has more than one exterior wall, window area is placed proportionally on each.

The window area is positioned in continuous horizontal bands on each exterior wall, although the configuration of window area on each wall is not significant since neither daylighting or self shading from the building is modeled. See Figure G-D.

While the prescriptive envelope requirements provide an exception for street-level, street-side vertical fenestration (e.g., store display windows), the building performance rating method does not. Window area in the baseline building is always determined as described above.

Based on the wordage above, I must develop the baseline model with either the same glass areas as the proposed building (essentially copying the proposed model and just updating U-values, etc.) or 40% of the exterior wall, whichever is smaller. Since I have roughly 60% of glazing, I will have to redistribute the glass into continuous horizontal bands on each exterior wall, similar to how ASHRAE 90.1-2004. However, as I began to look at the glass % of each exterior wall, I ran into a problem:

Well, Yes and No. It very much depends on which standard, 2004 or 2007, you
are going to use.

What Will quoted is from 90.1-2004 (User Manual), so I answered accordingly
in my last email. The proof can be found at Page G-16, *Example G-D?Baseline

In 2007, however, it says: " ...The baseline building has each window

It appears to me nobody has noticed William's actual question... :O

 

I think the total under the "Wall SQ FT" column in the provided table is causing you some unnecessary confusion, William.  While one can (apparently) debate a variety of approaches, you should be able to define 0.40*55,105.72 = 22,042 SF of fenestration on the ~55k SF of envelope area =).

 

Uniform, horizontal bands as described in 90.1 is one approach, but are not necessary the easiest - it depends on your modeling program and preferences.  If you are under 90.1-2007 as you suggest, be cautious that a building in strict compliance with 90.1-2004 may not necessarily maintain the proportions between faces as required under 2007.  In effect, 2007 is no longer "rewarding" designers choosing to not place their windows on Northern facades. 

 

The alternative to defining horizontal bands (and also my personal preference) would be to start with your proposed, actual layout, and simply multiply the width (or height) of each vertical fenestration by 40%/[actual WWR] = (40/60.66) = 0.6594... in your case.  I'd advise utilizing excel to carry out the numbers and minimize rounding errors as they will add up.  After this procedure, your WWR should calculate to 40%.  

 

Neither approach described (uniform reductions of an actual layout & continuous horizontal bands) is "wrong," though 2004's wording appears rigid.  The "proportionate reduction" approach described by myself, Carol and Jason has been in use successfully for LEED projects under 90.1-2004.  

 

In any case, 90.1-2007 has removed the phrase "continuous horizontal bands" as Cheney illustrates.  Either approach is acceptable, and which one should pursue is more practically a matter of what software package you're using and which method is the easiest for the modeler.

 

Happy holidays everyone!

The section of the standard states "Vertical fenestration 

areas for new buildings and additions shall equal that in 

the proposed design or 40% of gross abovegrade wall area, 

whichever is smaller, and shall be distributed on each face 

of the building in the same proportions in the proposed 

design." I've always assumed that you keep all the windows 

from the proposed design and just make them smaller. In your 

example since each window would be about 2/3 the proposed size.

Hi Will, 

 

If I remember clearly, the continuous horizontal bands should be placed across all orientations and even for exterior walls without window in the proposed design. In this case, 40% window should be placed at North.

Hi Will,

I think your answer is here:

The fenestration area in the baseline building shall be equal to the fenestration area in the proposed building or 40% of the exterior wall, whichever is less.

Based on your table you need to reduce the window area to be 40% of the overall wall area, making it a band as described, except for the North wall with 0% glass as it is already less than 40%.

Happy Holidays!

Oh! There was the problem... I was looking at the 90.1 2004 User's Manual!

 

So as long as we proportionally reduce windows to bring the overall building glazing percentage to 40%, I should be good?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] SAP calculation sheet appendix Q MVHR
Message-ID: <AANLkTin08EJF3SubyToa2fKgtZGxc4CVNJBdrgDvajuF@mail.gmail.com>

Dear,

in the SAP calculation input (25)m is mentioned that this value can be taken
from the appendix Q calculation sheet. However, such calculation sheet is
not shown on the appendix Q website, nor does the test procedure for MVHR
mentions the calculation of the ventilation rate. It simply states 9 l/s for
kitchens and 6 l/s for any wet room. Only for heat pumps a calculation sheet
is provided through that website.

Can anyone tell mee how the ventilation rate can be calculated based on
appendix Q?

thanks,

Leen

Subject: [Bldg-sim] leed and firestations 90.1 baseline hvac answer from
	gbci/usgbc
In-Reply-To: <AANLkTin08EJF3SubyToa2fKgtZGxc4CVNJBdrgDvajuF@mail.gmail.com>

Message-ID: <4D19F712.3050002@gmail.com>

we have received two separate answers from the usgbc/gbci (same 
individual responding) concerning fire stations and 90.1 baseline hvac 
systems with regards to a leed review.  note:  these are responses to 
questions submitted to the usgbc thru the support section of the usgbc 
website by two separate engineering offices, one on nov 9, the other a 
week or so later.  as the responses were sent from the same email 
address (to two different engineering offices) they are similar but not 
quite exact.  response emails received monday, dec 20, 2010.

the responder also requested we let her know which projects were 
affected by the reviewer's comments so the comments could be corrected - 
unfortunately this is after the work was done to change the models to 
meet the resubmittal deadlines so the models won't be changed again 
(unless there are more comments)  as time = money = energy.

Answer #1:  Case #00333388
Thank you for contacting the Green Building Certification Institute.

Additionally, your position as described to determine the Baseline case 
HVAC system for fire stations is appropriate and correct.  The Baseline 
case HVAC system should be determined in accordance with Table G3.1.1A 
as non-residential.

Although the building may contain residential spaces as defined by the 
Standard, the predominant space types would not be residential, and 
therefore, the HVAC system type to be modeled in the Baseline case would 
not be #1 or #2. The Baseline case HVAC system would be selected in 
accordance with Table G3.1.1A based on the predominant space type (most 
likely not residential). Additional system types would not be permitted, 
unless an Exception to G3.1.1 was applicable.

Note that the building envelope requirements for the Baseline case at 
the residential spaces of the project (i.e. sleeping quarters) should be 
determined using the Residential column of the appropriate Climate Zone 
table in Section 5.

Answer #2:   Case #00339411
Question 1 and 2: A fire station is not typically classified as 
residential for the application of ASHRAE 90.1-2004. Please note that 
although the building may contain residential spaces as defined by the 
Standard, the predominant space types would not be residential, and 
therefore, the HVAC system type to be modeled in the Baseline case would 
not be #1 or #2. The Baseline case HVAC system would be selected in 
accordance with Table G3.1.1A based on the predominant space type (most 
likely not residential).

Question 3: Yes, if the predominant space type for the fire station is 
non-residential, and the project is less than 75,000 sf, in accordance 
with Table G3.1.1A, the Baseline case HVAC system for the entire 
building would be type #3, unless an Exception to G3.1.1 would apply.

Question 4: Only a single Baseline HVAC system type should be modeled, 
unless an Exception to G3.1.1 would apply.

Message-ID: <AANLkTin3093RFTGESyf7qO6Db_XsZ3yX7qFob_zW2CB7@mail.gmail.com>

Dear,

can anyone explain me the logic behin the formula in attachement? It is the
formula to calculate u in case the off-heating is larger than the value of
4+0.25T

Is there some background information provided for the explanation of the
parameters and formulas for the calculation of the utilisation factor for
heating and the value Tsc (page 143-144 in the SAP2009 document)?


Thanks,

Leen
