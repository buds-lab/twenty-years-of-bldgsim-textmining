Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Curtain wall frames and fenestration area
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200404121353.AA5358375pd80000085881@gard.com>

Has anyone actually done a comparison to see what sort of effect modeling the frame different ways has on the actual loads in the space.  I realize there is no panacea answer but I would be curious to know what the effect of modeling a single window with enlarged frame area vs actual window size and frame width is.  Is it a 5% difference or a 20% or .05%.  I am curious only because I have always assumed the difference was small and that there were more important (larger impact) modeling items to worry about.  
 
Please note that I am not trying to discount the importance of correctly modeling windows but trying to understand the overall impact different modeling techniques might have on output.

Also, if you are using either of the detailed glazing models, the way Steve describes should better account for edge-of-glass effects. Dividing glazing up into lots of tiny little "panes," as some architects want, has an extemely delterious effect on the IGU overall U-factor, above and beyond the effect of the frame itself. If using the SC inputs, it might be instructive to run Window 5 on some similar configurations, to check the overall U-value with DOE2's output. (Noting where interior, exterior etc films are/aren't accounted for.)

If you want a pretty rendering for the client, I recommend a separate model, for presentation only. And then if trying to do daylighting calcs......;

		Renee,
		 
		The easiest way to do this is to use a single window on each wall.  Calculate the percentage of window area that is actually frame and then adjust the frame-width to account for the increase.  You may end up with a window frame width that is 12 inches or bigger  (if the wall is large enough).  With a little ingenuity you can write some BDL code that will automatically calculate the window width, frame width and x position of the window on the wall so you don't get any cautions or warnings.  .

		Greetings,
		
		I am modeling a high-rise building in eQuest which has a significant amount of fenestration as curtain wall. This curtain wall, like many curtain walls, has metal frames around many small panes of glass that make up the total curtain wall. My question is, how do you treat the frames and the fenestration area?  If I model each small pane of glass and add the exact frame, this would probably overwhelm DOE2 due to the huge number of small windows.  If I model the glass as one big window, then is it correct to just add the total width of the frame to each of these large windows? Also, some of these curtain wall panes have fins to complicate things, so if I do one big glass pane, then adding the fins would make huge fins on either side of the glass. If you have dealt with modeling curtain walls, as probably many of you have, please let me know how you have dealt with these issues.

I agree with chip - the value of having something pop up in your email
is huge. I probably wouldn't bother to visit the forum site as much.
Also, a lot of times people send attachments by email in response to
questions. This might not be viable for a forum site. I still think
there are benefits to the forum though - the most important being the
archive of threads. Jason - do you have the infrastructure to build an
archive?

Alec et al --

I agree with all of your points.

However, one of the values of the eMail format is that activity
announces itself.  When a message appears, I take a moment to read it.
If I have something to add, I answer.

I imagine that I would rarely go read a forum unless I had a specific
question or issue.

Can forums be set up so they send an occasional eMail noting that 42 new
postings have appeared in the last week?  Or perhaps there is some other
reminder scheme commonly used?

It would be too bad if the forum scheme resulted in a lot of
posting-into-the-void.

There are several forums that I participate in from time to time that
are web based.  
Advantages are many:  Threads are categorized by topic, and old threads
readily archived.  Sample topics could include things like DOE2
simulation questions, weather questions, Energy Plus questions, job
postings, conferences, calls for papers, etc.  You can also decide what
you you are interested in and what you want to read about, rather than
having to sort out an inbox-full of posts about something that doesn't
tickle your fancy. 
 
Not sure what the budget is for maintaining the bldg-sim list, but I
think the usefulness quotient would go up a notch if it were a web
forum.
 
Example web forums:

What is the general sentiment out there? 
(if this were a web-based forum, we could initiate a user poll to find

In your research with radiant heating cooling savings, have you found any 
energy "savings" that can be attributed directly to the use of the radiant 
system vs other systems (air supply in particular).  For example, I have 
seen some papers that note that the heating setpoint can be relaxed while 
still maintaining thermal comfort with a radiant system.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200404071250.AA5046546pd80000074611@gard.com>

Hello Bldg Sim List!

Does anyone that uses eQuest have comments on how well eQuest handles 
daylighting analyses?

Someone's comments below:

"Most of my simulation experience is with DOE-2.1E and eQUEST/DOE-2.2. 
Both
of those programs allow simple daylighting simulation.  These programs 
have
geometric input, inside walls, ceilings, etc., with adjustable 
reflectance,
multiple and variable windows, and sensor location.  Their algorithm does
reasonable calculations for direct daylighting including interior
reflectance.  They are probably not suitable for more complicated
daylighting, such as: light shelves, pipes, or any multiple bounces before
the daylight gets to its intended location."

Any comments would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!

Caroline,

I am not familiar with Energy 10, but from the questions you are asking, it
sounds like Energy 10s daylighting algorithm is very simplified.  A quick
look at the Energy 10 web site did nothing to change that opinion.

Most of my simulation experience is with DOE-2.1E and eQUEST/DOE-2.2.  Both
of those programs allow simple daylighting simulation.  These programs have
geometric input, inside walls, ceilings, etc., with adjustable reflectance,
multiple and variable windows, and sensor location.  Their algorithm does
reasonable calculations for direct daylighting including interior
reflectance.  They are probably not suitable for more complicated
daylighting, such as: light shelves, pipes, or any multiple bounces before
the daylight gets to its intended location.

If you do not get a better answer than mine, I entered lighting simulation
on Google and got some good hits.  Good luck!

Mike

I have been using Ecotect, Energy-10 and Desktop

Radiance and Ecotect address material reflectance, but
Energy-10 does not. My concern is that I am getting
slightly 'off' daylight factor values in Energy-10 in

walls, floors ceilings.

Has anyone dealt with this?

Hello,
I apologize for the numerous postings I sent this
morning...I followed some bad advice, which was to
send questions separately instead of in one long (and
it was VERY LONG) email.
I am also fairly new to list-serves, so didn't know
that every mail would go out to everyone immediately,
I thought it would got to a central forum/bulletin
type thing.

Again, sorry for the hassle.

All my postings are unique (with the exception of the
first bit), and I hope the subject headers can
identify, for you, the questions to which you might
respond.

Regards,
Caroline

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200404070950.AA5015828pd80000073975@gard.com>

Dear All,

For those interested in the simulation of radiant heating/cooling systems,
IRC has developed a semi-analytical model for integration in energy
simulation software that use the one-dimensional numerical modeling to
calculate the heat transfer within the building construction assemblies. 

The model combines the one-dimensional model of the energy simulation
software with a two-dimensional analytical model.  The advantage of this
model over the one-dimensional one is that it accurately predict the contact
surface temperature of the circuit-tubing and the adjacent medium, required
to compute the boiler/chiller power, and the minimum and maximum
ceiling/floor temperatures, required for local moisture condensation
(ceiling cooling systems), thermal discomfort (heating floor systems) and
controls.  The model predictions for slab-on-grade heating systems compared
very well with the results from a full two-dimensional numerical model.

The model was implemented in the Canadian software HOT3000 and the UK
software ESP-r as a plant component. The implementation of this model in the
ESP-r program offers additional flexibilities to the radiant system designer
community, mainly:
?	Designers can use any control algorithm possible in ESP-r with the
new plant component (e.g.., use the flux or temperature control, and compare
their performance).
?	Designers can specify any number of radiant surfaces of the building
fed by the same or different heat source.
?	Designers can size realistic radiant systems, and get realistic
energy consumption (from the source side) and cost.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200404070924.AA2435296pd80000073921@gard.com>

I am a graduate student of architecture at the
University of Waterloo. I am using Energy-10, Ecotect
and Desktop Radiance to study the role of daylighting
with respect to heating and cooling energy for two
existing Canadian 'green' buildings. This posting is
only one of my many questions, which recently arose
from closer examination of my models.

RADIANCE: I have recently run a few simplified test
models and compared my results to true exterior light
conditions using a hand-held light meter. The results
are somewhat frustrating, but interesting nonetheless.
My questions here are particularly: 
1. How does Radiance calculate the external light
levels? Is it simply the calculation for CIE
standards?
2. On a perfectly clear morning in a low pollution
area (assumed turbidity=2) my light meter reading read
approx. 55600 lux. A Radiance test (modelling an
unobstructed horizontal plane outdoors) for the same
date and time, and lat. long settings, with
turbidity=2 produced an exterior light level of 47000
lux (15% off the true reading!). While there may have
been some diffuse reflection off nearby buildings,
there was certainly no direct reflection or shadow on
the light meter. This seems to be much too large a
difference.
3. On what seemed to be a uniformly overcast day, the
exterior readings gave external illuminance of 19250
lux, while Radiance simulated an unobstructed
horizontal plane at 9944 lux (overcast sky) and 13108
lux (uniform sky)...differences of 48% and 32%
respectively.

I know Radiance must be addressing some
average/typical conditions, so how much variation from
the simulation is it reasonable for me to expect? Will
this change for different sky types?

Regards,
Caroline

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200404070906.AA0645109pd80000073869@gard.com>

I am a graduate student of architecture at the
University of Waterloo. I am using Energy-10, Ecotect
and Desktop Radiance to study the role of daylighting
with respect to heating and cooling energy for two
existing Canadian 'green' buildings. This posting is
only one of my many questions, which recently arose
from closer examination of my models.

RADIANCE: I am trying to assess the effect of changing
glazing types. For buildings in both Vancouver and
Toronto, daylight studies in the late winter afternoon
(based on sun charts and other software, I'm using 4pm
Dec21, where the sun is not yet set, but very low in
the sky), where I have not modelled any surrounding
obstructions such as trees or buildings, my internal
illuminance levels are consistently about 200 lux,
even on the east side of the building. Common sense
tells me there should be MUCH MUCH less light than
this...probably no more than 100 lux. 

Also, when changing glazing types (ie, from clear to
reflective) a significant change is noticed for noon
hour lighting, but the 4pm Dec21 lighting remains at
200 lux. What could I be mis-assuming? According to
weather data and other light simulations in Ecotect,
there should still be some light at 4pm on Dec21, but
for an overcast sky, like I'm using, it should be much
less than 200 lux indoors. Has anyone worked with
overcast, late-day skies and had similar experiences?

Regards,
Caroline

RADIANCE: I had hoped to use Desktop Radiance to
evaluate daylight factors in key areas of the
buildings. While I am able to model fairly realistic
interior illumination results and analyse these using
the False Colour plot I have encountered problems.
When I opt for a daylight factor plot, the scale
remains at a range of 0 to 1.0 and is unaffected by
any changes I try to make through the analysis
dialogue box. The result in Radiance is a washed out
image all in the 'maximum' colour (my other software
suggests DF% between 2 and 4%) confirming DF%>1.0 How
can I adjust the scale for DF% readings in Desktop
Radiance?

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200404070853.AA5355375pd80000073812@gard.com>

I am a graduate student of architecture at the
University of Waterloo. I am using Energy-10, Ecotect
and Desktop Radiance to study the role of daylighting
with respect to heating and cooling energy for two
existing Canadian 'green' buildings. This posting is
only one of my many questions, which recently arose
from closer examination of my models.

I am trying variants of my models using alternate
glazing types, with properties generated by FRAME|plus
online window calculator. For example, I am
substituting triple glazed clear, double low-e windows
in a building that originally had spectrally selective
triple glazing, to see the effect on the thermal
profile. Energy-10 glazing can be defined by U-value,
SHGC and Visible Transmittance, but then I have to
pick a 'glazing type' code. I read in help that this
'glazing type' helps E-10 simulate the effects of
oblique sunlight (?) These glazing types are greatly
limiting. My question, for this example would be, what
do I select. All the triple glazed options have a
'heat mirror' coating. Would selecting double glazed
clear with low e work just as well for this example,
as I have already provide the U-value, SHGC and VT?

Does this assumption hold true for other triple
glazing which isn't 'heat mirrored'? Or does the third
light make a big difference?

Caroline

I am a graduate student of architecture at the

with respect to heating and cooling energy for two
existing Canadian 'green' buildings. This posting is
only one of my many questions, which recently arose
from closer examination of my models.

ENERGY-10: A question about shading. My south facade
has two shading elements for each window unit,
dividing the windows into three portions. Top-down
there is one exposed area with a light shelf
underneath, this lightshelf is an overhang for the
middle glazed area with another light shelf below
that; finally there is a slightly larger glazing area
under the second light shelf with vertical wall under
that. To simulate this shading, is it more appropriate
to break up the south windows into three types (Top
pane with no shading, middle pane with shading above
and lower pane with shading above)? or to figure out
some sort of equivalent, larger, overhang to position
at the top of the original window unit, and forgo the
effect of the small unshaded top portion? Alternately,
it has been suggested that I use a high ground
reflectance to simulate the light shelf.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200404070840.AA4006796pd80000073755@gard.com>

I am a graduate student of architecture at the
University of Waterloo. I am using Energy-10, Ecotect
and Desktop Radiance to study the role of daylighting
with respect to heating and cooling energy for two
existing Canadian 'green' buildings. This posting is
only one of my many questions, which recently arose
from closer examination of my models.

ENERGY-10: It seems throughout my studies that the DF%
calculation does not address solar orientation. While
I can't believe this is so, several tests of square
buildings with identical north, east, south and west
walls have shown DF% to be equal on all sides. In the
Canadian climate, where the sun is predominantly from
the south, I would assume the North DF% should be
notable lower than the South DF% with East and West
being close to equal. Has anyone had a similar
experience? An Ecotect model confirms my instincts. 

Regards,
Caroline

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Multiple windows for DF% calculation in Energy-10
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200404070837.AA375500pd80000073748@gard.com>

I am a graduate student of architecture at the
University of Waterloo. I am using Energy-10, Ecotect
and Desktop Radiance to study the role of daylighting
with respect to heating and cooling energy for two
existing Canadian 'green' buildings. This posting is
only one of my many questions, which recently arose
from closer examination of my models.

ENERGY-10: When applying daylighting, I can only
specify one window type per orientation for the
'apply' Daylight EES. This tends to give me reasonable
DF% values. Once I change the glazing to include more
than on window type per orientation, the DF% drops
dramatically, and the trend in the one building I've
worked on shows heating energy decreasing and lighting
energy increasing. Cooling is very similar between the
two cases. How does Energy-10 know WHERE to place the
windows for daylighting? As the overall glazing:wall
ratio is roughly the same, I would tend to trust the
'apply' case more, as it seems to make better use of
the daylighting information, although this is at the
cost of a more precise representation of the true
glazing condition. Is there something I may be
missing?

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] DOE 2.1E validation
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200404021209.AA093393pd80000063437@gard.com>

In order to level the playing field in showing ECB compliance, it is
also necessary to explain how the programs (that have passed the STD140
test) are used in modeling different Energy Conservation Measures
(ECMs).  

For example the use of the DOE2.1E program for: under-floor air
distribution; occupancy based ventilation control using CO2 sensors in
the return air system; reduced ventilation with high efficiency
(carbon/ionization) filters; lake water cooling; occupancy based
lighting control.  Occupancy based ventilation & lighting control are
done with schedules, which are approximated by the program user.  In
this office we re-use the occupancy schedule.  There are several other
ECMs that require user determined schedules.  The validity of the demand
cost depends on entering all electricity consuming equipment in the
building such as elevators and the operating schedule of each equipment,
which is also approximated by the program user.  Establishing
recommended standard schedules will help.

The space perimeter depth and the location of light sensor in the space
affect energy savings from daylighting controls.  In the case of a space
with a high perimeter depth, the internal heat gains will cancel out the
heat losses through the envelope in winter and it is possible eliminate
heating energy entirely when it is -40 outside.  It is also possible to
show energy savings with incorrect and inappropriate input data.  The
program will produce results if the input is within a certain range.
Recently I tried to compare packaged VAV DX units (gas heating) with
GSHP.  I made all the changes required in the "System" module of DOE2.1E
for ground source heat pumps, but I forgot to change the system type
from PVAVS to HP.  I got results that sort of looked right.

I have been comparing the results from the DOE2.1E, TRACE-700 and HAP-4
programs for specific ECMs and a liberal conclusion would be that they
are approximately in the same ballpark.  This has to do with the way I
use these programs, my inexperience with some of the programs, the
incorrect use of the programs, and my lack of understanding of the
details of how each program models the various ECMs.  It is possible to
use these programs the way people drive cars without knowing the theory
of internal combustion engines.  In this office, mechanical engineers
are responsible for energy analysis and they have to follow up their
energy analysis decisions through final design and the responsibility
extends through construction and operation.

In order to level the playing field, the code authorities will have to
check the ECB compliance submittal program input data from different
programs that have passed the STD140 test to make sure that the ECMs
were modeled correctly. I think that this might require some
predetermined standard input and output reports from all programs.  The
best way of expressing the "intent" of the ECB method is with examples
and case studies of the use of programs.  I also think that
certification of those responsible for showing energy code compliance
might be necessary.  Are there any plans to check the results of the
energy analysis after the building is built and in operation?  What
happens to those who break building energy codes?  There is a self
imposed penalty of paying higher energy bills.  There is no risk to
life, health or safety.

ANSI has just recently approved addendum 90.1p.  Addendum p adds the

simulation program shall be tested according to ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 140
and

This implies that for a building energy analysis tool to be allowed for

Can anyone help me in providing any information regarding ASHRAE
approving
DOE 2.1 as an energy simulation tool?
I know this might sound strange, even many years after the predictor
shootout and knowing that 90.1 uses DOE 2 for most of the energy
simulation,
but is it written in blood anywhere.

Jeff, and everyone, 

90.1-1999 does not define a particular program for the
ECB Method or even that the program use 8,760 hours
for the simulation.  BLAST and DOE2 were just listed
as examples of programs that complied with the
requirements.  As an example of other programs, there
was a threshold set for minimum calculation hours
that, to be perfectly honest, was determined after
deciding that Trace could adequately model most
buildings to the accuracy that we needed.  

While SP140 has now been made a part of 90.1-2001, it
was not around back in the dark ages and is not a part
of the requirements for computer programs when
simulating a building under 90.1-1999.  :-)

BLAST simulations were done by PNL on behalf of the
committee.  They were for the purpose of defining the
energy impacts of varying mechanical equipment
efficiency, insulation levels, etc. This work formed
the foundation of the requirements in those sections
but that does not mean that BLAST must to be used
under the ECB methodology.

[former ECB subcommittee chair in that long ago era.]

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] eQuest / DOE2.2 output questions - looking for
VBAcode...

Does anyone have any MS word macros that they would share for selecting
different output reports and printing them, or exporting some of the
tabular data to MS Excel?  Or opening some of the output directly in
excel? 

For instance you can get the monthly and annual summaries of the
electric and fuel in the CSV file, but for complex rate structures you
can't immediately turn that into dollar amounts, you'd have to import
something like the ES-F report to get at each electric block. 

The default graphs are nice, but let's say that you wanted to compare
your simulation results with some data that you had paper bills for an
SDG&E rate AT-TOU. 

Energy/billing comparisons seem to be the main reason I'd want to use
these things, although another possibility would be to construct tables
of SV-A data or to refresh the value of some other parameter that
changes based on modifications to your simulation - without opening and
formatting a 4 MB *.sim file.  I see 14 different output files in my
directory, but don't how I would get any information out of them except
for the *.sim, *.csv, and of course the text files. 

If anyone can point me in the direction of tools that might be out
there, or give me some strategy tips on how I might accomplish these
things in VBA I would really appreciate it. 

Thanks!

ASHRAE STD90 is now being adopted into building codes.  It is no longer
just a guideline.  In legal disputes concerning large commercial
building projects, all building code violations might be brought up
including issues that are unrelated to the dispute.  Energy code
violation might result in higher utility bills for the building owner
but there is no risk to life or limb.

The prescriptive compliance method and the ComCheck-EZ program are clear
and straightforward to follow and use.  STD90 User Manual explains the
prescriptive method process with examples.  In my opinion the "intent"
of the Energy Cost Budget (ECB) method which also requires utility rate
analysis can be explained with case studies of different types of
building projects in different climatic locations using different types
of local utility rates.

The bottom line results from energy simulation programs of various
options should be looked at with a weighted point system evaluation
matrix that considers other factors such as first & maintenance costs,
reliability of equipment, local skilled construction and maintenance
staff and replacement parts.  The most reliable, dependable and
cost-effective option over a reasonable life-cycle period (which might
turn out to be also the most energy efficient) is the one that usually
gets designed and built.  

A published library of case studies of energy efficient design of
different building types would also be very useful in education.  The
case studies would consist of design criteria, operating schedules,
schematic-simplified layouts of floors, systems and plant, riser
diagrams, and equipment schedules. The purpose would be to identify and
explain the components of the building that affect energy usage and
discuss the pros and cons of various ECMs.  I have started creating such
modified and simplified case studies based on SOM projects for graduate
courses at the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT).

 DOE2.1E program is still the program in use in this office (SOM) to
show compliance with ASHRAE STD90 and the local energy codes that have
been introduced recently.  The DOE2 and all programs based on it are not
suitable for building design loads analysis.  Is there any interest in
establishing an informal group to discuss the merits of the various
energy simulation programs available today and applying them to various
types of building projects to show code compliance?  This could be done
by exchanging email addresses.

Hi David-

You may want to try to import the ES-F report into excel using the
following:

1.  In the .sim file, highlight the portions of the ES-F report that you
want and copy it to the clipboard
2.  In excel, paste it as normal
3.  Highlight the first column of cells of the pasted material
4.  Go to "DATA" in the toolbar
5.  Choose "Text to columns" which opens a wizard that allows you to
separate that data into individual cells so that the info can be used in
formulas etc.  You will probably have to do some formatting of cells to make
the table easier to read.

I've used this method on some of the other reports, i.e. PS-E, BEPU, etc.

Good luck.

Hi All-

What would happen if you forced economizer operation below 55F using the
cooling availability schedule set up as ON/OFF/Temp and designating cooling
during the spring, winter and fall as only available when OD temp is above
55F?  Would this then force the VAV system to increase airflow to the
required zones to satisfy cooling requirements (at the expense of increased
fan energy)?

  David,

  We've run into this as well.  One issue that is relatively common with
simulated VAV systems is that the economizer operation and the VAV box
operation can be completely independent of each other, even if you don't
want them to be.  This may or might not be an issue in an actual system
depending on how the controls are configured.  Even if the design flow of
outside air is sufficient to cool a zone, the reduced flow at some level of
VAV turndown may not be sufficient.  For this reason, there are hours of the
year (typically cooler periods) when a constant volume unit may show less
simulated cooling energy.

  One solution to this is to schedule increased levels of outside air during
cooler months, perhaps in the morning.  The solution depends on when the
cooling load is not being met by outside air alone.

  You can also set the priorities of air flow and temperature reset.
Varying these will impact the trade off between fan energy and cooling
energy.

  Good luck.

    Hi everybody!

    First of all, I would like to say thank you to everybody that have
helped me in the past, I used to send emails to everyone but I?m sure I?ve
forgotten some of them.

    I?m simulating an office building with eQUEST, and I?m trying to know
how much energy can be saved up.

    The HVAC system type is "Standard VAV with HW Reheat" for all the zones,
the cold deck reset is 55?F. I?ve also set up a drybulb temperature
economizer, high limit 65?F.

    I think that when the drybulb exterior temperature is below 55?F there
should be free-cooling, but checking the temperature values this only
happens when it?s under 49?F

    does anybody know why it could be?

    thanks

Dave,
 
Be sure to check and make sure you are running eQUEST version 3.40 or later.  For a long time eQUEST had a bug that did not allow the economizer in system type VAVS to work properly.  I cannot remember which version solved the problem but I know the economizer works properly in version 3.40.

Those are the same versions and updates that I am running on WIN XP Home
with no problems.  Have you tried reinstalling?

I did install mine over previous versions.  You might want to uninstall
eQUEST, then reinstall 3.44, try it, then the e update.  If that doesn't
work back up a bit further.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200404271512.AA1219156pd80000119460@gard.com>

I am trying to model, using eQuest, a low humidity area. The space is
served by several air handlers each with a desiccant dryer (Lithium
Chloride) attached. In eQuest the air handlers are modeled as reheat fan
systems, and the desiccant type is Solid-Vent-1.  The control mode is 0
and the air flow fraction is 0.95.  I have the max humidity set point at
30% RH, but the output from the program indicates that the rooms are
running between 40 and 49 percent RH.  Base on the hourly reporting I
have set up it doesn't appear that the desiccant is doing anything.  

I was wondering if anybody has had experience modeling add-on desiccant
in eQuest and could shed some light on what I am missing here.  Any
suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] hybrid solar collector
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200404241653.AA5308687pd80000113588@gard.com>

Hello:

 

I'm afraid that this is more complicated that it seems. However, I'm pleased
to say help is on its way. Mr. Sakkara Rasisuttha, a Ph.D. candidate at TAMU
is completing his PhD thesis on the use of a triple-effect solar collector
that collects heat during the day along with electricity, and then can be
used to reject heat at night. His work includes experimental work to
determine the collector properties, which show, as expected, that an
unglazed collector is not a good heat collector, but is a good heat
rejector. Therefore, it would appear that one might want to consider a thin
plastic cover over the PV collector to boost the efficiency of the thermal
collection. A paper on this has been submitted to the IBPSA USA conference
in Boulder this summer. Thesis due out shortly.

Does anybody know tool to size and estimate performance of a hybrid solar
collector generating simultaneously heat (domestic hot water) and
electricity.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200404221911.AA1136890pd80000109789@gard.com>

 
April 22, 2004, the Earth Day!

VisualDOE 4.0 - A Sustainable Building Design Tool


 

Architectural Energy Corporation is proud to announce the release of
VisualDOE 4.0, the 10th Anniversary Edition of its popular energy
simulation program.

 

VisualDOE 4.0 is a powerful, yet easy-to-use "front end" to DOE2.1E, the
industry-standard, building energy simulation program.  VisualDOE is
developed and supported by architects and engineers as a tool for
designers and building scientists to accurately model the performance of
building design alternatives.  VisualDOE is also commonly used to
perform energy calculations for LEED certification.

 

VisualDOE covers all major building systems including lighting,
daylighting, HVAC, water heating, and building envelope. Among the wide
range of simulation results are electricity and gas consumption,
electric demand, and utility cost. Hourly results are available for
detailed analysis. 

 

VisualDOE is packaged with the latest version of DOE2.1E from Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory. VisualDOE saves time and energy by
automating the process of writing the input file, running the simulation
and extracting the results from the output file.  No experience with
DOE2.1E is necessary, but advanced users have the option to modify the
input files directly and still run the simulations from within
VisualDOE. 

 

VisualDOE supports both SI and IP units and has thousands of licensed
users in more than 40 countries.  Architectural Energy Corporation
provides free technical supports for one year via email, phone, web
resources, and user newsletters with the purchase of any new license or
upgrade. In addition, Architectural Energy Corporation offers several
VisualDOE training seminars throughout the year; see below for further
details.


New Features of VisualDOE 4.0

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] specifying duct efficiency in model
References: <MDAEMON-F200404190940.AA4040953pd80000122432@gard.com>
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200404211246.AA4604328pd80000107206@gard.com>

I am wondering how current energy modelers incorporate duct efficiency in
homes.  Currently, I have specified all my ducts to be within my
unconditioned basement.  Using the defaults from the "Building America"
program in the ASHRAE standard 152 duct efficiency calculations, my
"Delivery Effectiveness" and "Distribution System Efficiency" results are

"Delivery Effectiveness"                                   "Distribution
System Efficiency"
Heating, design 0.76                                        Heating, design
0.72
Heating, seasonal 0.78                                     Heating, seasonal
0.74
Cooling, design 0.84                                        Cooling, design
0.79
Cooling, seasonal 0.87                                     Cooling, seasonal
0.83

My first question would be whether I should use the "Delivery Effectiveness"
or "Distribution System Efficiency" to specify the efficiency of my thermal
distribution system.  My second question would be should I just use the
heating and cooling average of the design or seasonal efficiency or
something else entirely.

My final question pertains to: once I choose my duct efficiency, how to
include it in my model.  Should I assign some percentage of the loss to duct
air leakage and thereby model some of my air supply going directly to the
basement.  Then account for the rest of the loss, conduction loss, by having
the air temperature leaving the registers lower/larger from the air
temperature leaving my system heating/cooling coils respectively.

Thank you

I'll add my voice to the crowd - the Bldg-Sim list has been valuable to me as a means of monitoring what goes on in the "real-world" simulation world.  It's fairly easy for me to quickly look at a posting and figure out whether I want to read it or not.
 
Unless a web-based forum offered the capability to have all postings emailed to me, I doubt that I'd have the initiative to go to the website and figure out what's new since the last time I was there.
 
That being said - there certainly is value in categorizing and archiving the materials to make the information more accessible.  I'd just hate to see my particular use-case degraded because of it.

I agree with chip - the value of having something pop up in your email is huge. I probably wouldn't bother to visit the forum site as much. Also, a lot of times people send attachments by email in response to questions. This might not be viable for a forum site. I still think there are benefits to the forum though - the most important being the archive of threads. Jason - do you have the infrastructure to build an archive?

Alec et al --

I agree with all of your points.

However, one of the values of the eMail format is that activity announces itself.  When a message appears, I take a moment to read it.  If I have something to add, I answer.

I imagine that I would rarely go read a forum unless I had a specific question or issue.

Can forums be set up so they send an occasional eMail noting that 42 new postings have appeared in the last week?  Or perhaps there is some other reminder scheme commonly used?

It would be too bad if the forum scheme resulted in a lot of posting-into-the-void.

Hello,
 
(a question for Jason Glazer, perhaps)
 
Is it possible, feasible, or worthwhile to change the format of the bldg-sim list to a web-based forum?
There are several forums that I participate in from time to time that are web based.  
Advantages are many:  Threads are categorized by topic, and old threads readily archived.  Sample topics could include things like DOE2 simulation questions, weather questions, Energy Plus questions, job postings, conferences, calls for papers, etc.  You can also decide what you you are interested in and what you want to read about, rather than having to sort out an inbox-full of posts about something that doesn't tickle your fancy. 
 
Not sure what the budget is for maintaining the bldg-sim list, but I think the usefulness quotient would go up a notch if it were a web forum.
 
Example web forums: 
http://www.taunton.com/pages/forums.asp
 
What is the general sentiment out there? 
(if this were a web-based forum, we could initiate a user poll to find out the answer!)
 
p.s.: I am not trying to start a ruckus here, I definitely enjoy the list and have found it very useful over the years.  
 
 
Cheers,
 
Alec Stevens, PE

Hi Renee,

I see your name pop up from time to time, so it's nice to be able to respond to your question.

Instead of trying to model each individual pane, try breaking the curtain wall into larger, more managable sections using the NFRC U-value and SHGC for the glazing.  Then you have a little more flexibility with modeling the fins to resemble what's really there.  You'll never get it exact, but close is good enough.

Good luck, and hope to run into you again sometime in the future.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Curtain wall frames and fenestration area


Greetings,

I am modeling a high-rise building in eQuest which has a significant amount of fenestration as curtain wall. This curtain wall, like many curtain walls, has metal frames around many small panes of glass that make up the total curtain wall. My question is, how do you treat the frames and the fenestration area?  If I model each small pane of glass and add the exact frame, this would probably overwhelm DOE2 due to the huge number of small windows.  If I model the glass as one big window, then is it correct to just add the total width of the frame to each of these large windows? Also, some of these curtain wall panes have fins to complicate things, so if I do one big glass pane, then adding the fins would make huge fins on either side of the glass. If you have dealt with modeling curtain walls, as probably many of you have, please let me know how you have dealt with these issues.

Thank you,

Renee

With respect to the radiant thermostats, I had been researching their use and found that the Wirsbo radiant flooring people had developed one for Europe but had no plans to market the device in North America.  Schwank builds gas fired radiant heaters and has a black-body thermostat that measures the radiant component in addition to air temperature.  Other than that I have only found that most people control their systems with a slab temperature sensor in combination with a regular thermostat. (I have one design where I also monitor the humidity level in the space to reset the slab for cooling to avoid condensation).

I'd like to thank everyone who has contributed information to this
discussion.  It has been very informative for me.  I would like to revisit
one concept to give my thoughts and maybe get some more feedback, and then
I'll give it a rest.

One of the main claims to energy efficiency of a radiant system is the idea
that the thermostat can be set lower than for a forced-air system.  Yet
several people have disagreed with this claim, or said that the reduction is
typically only a couple of degrees.  Some people have also said that the
"two position" thermostat scenario that I described is not correct; that the
actual dynamics of a radiant system are different than what I assumed.

The thermostats I have observed in radiant systems are all simple
two-position thermostats with about 2F hysteresis; they are either "on" or
"off".  Some of these thermostats do not even have a labeled temperature
setpoint, they simply have a band with one end labeled 'colder' and the
other 'warmer'.  So let's look at the following scenario:

1.  The thermostat is set to 67F.  It turns on at 66F and off at 68F.
2.  The weather is mild, the house is floating in the low '70s, and the
thermostat is off.
3.  The weather starts to cool down, and the house temperature starts to
drop.
4.  The house gradually cools to 67F, and reaches equilibrium at that
temperature.  The thermostat never kicks on, because the temperature would
need to drop another degree.
5.  The occupants perceive the house to be cold, and raise the thermostat
setting.  They remember that the original setting felt too cold, so they
never set it back to 67F again.
6.  The thermostat is now set at the same setting as it would be for a
forced-air furnace, and all energy savings that could accrue by having it
lower are never realized.
7.  If they did set the thermostat lower once the weather got colder and the
radiant system was cycling and warming the surfaces, they would run into the
same problem once the weather warmed up for a period.  As soon as the
thermostat climbs above 68F and stays there for a while, the system stays
off, the surfaces cool, and once the space drops to 67F the occupants are
uncomfortable.

Theory predicts that people should be comfortable with a lower thermostat
setting, but field studies find otherwise.  Perhaps the above scenario is
why.

All of the thermostats I have ever seen have a cover that shields the sensor
from radiation; the sensor sees mainly the air temperature.  Are there any
thermostats specifically designed for radiant systems that sense mean
radiant temperature?  If so, how common are they?

Subject: [bldg-sim] Radiant Heating/Cooling


The discussion started by Dr. Laouadi has raised several issues related to
radiant heating and cooling systems, and I will attempt to add some of my
own perspective on these concerns raised by the various email
postings.  For those of you who are interested in modeling radiant heating
and cooling systems, a model has been available in EnergyPlus for some time
already and papers have been published regarding this model and its
predecessor model which was part of a research version of the BLAST
program.  Some of these papers are available on the web from the EnergyPlus
web site (www.energyplus.gov) and future papers describing some of the
recent enhancements are in the works.  Follow the link to Documentation and
then to Research Papers and Articles.  As Dr. Laouadi points out, an
integrated radiant model (such as the one found in EnergyPlus) is essential
to answering many of the questions posed here.

In answering Question 1 from Steve, Dr. Laouadi pointed out in his email
from earlier today that in many cases homeowners are not taking advantage
of the potential for lowering their thermostat settings.  That is not
surprising as most homeowners are accustomed to the air systems.  Steve
noted: "But, if the thermostat is lowered to 65F, and the ambient
temperature is 66F, then the radiant heat is off, and the mean radiant
temperature drops."  This is not exactly how the physics of all radiant
systems work.  Systems with any thermal mass will react more slowly than an
"instantaneous" air system.  The occupants will not notice a sudden drop in
temperature because of the mass of the system.  In addition, radiant
systems are not typically "on-off" as forced air systems.  Will there be
greater variation in temperature or comfort?  This depends on
sophistication of the controls and the construction details.  Clearly, more
thought has to be put into the design of a radiant system.  However, a
poorly designed system, whether radiant or conventional forced air, will
not make for a happy building owner.

Question 2 from Steve asked whether the reduced infiltration loss or the
increased surface heat loss will be the determining factor in whether a
radiant system will be more energy efficient.  Or, in a more broader sense,
are radiant systems inherently more efficient than forced air systems.  The
answer is: it depends.  In an ASHRAE paper, I showed that for a particular
case while the average unheated surface temperature did increase slightly
and thus increase the heat loss through those surfaces that the
infiltration losses were higher.  As a result, the radiant system was more
efficient than the conventional forced air system.  But this is by no means
a definitive answer.  It will depend on infiltration rates, exterior
envelope construction, and other details.  The question simply cannot be
answered by a single study--which is why it is important to have simulation
models that can help answer the question for a specific case.  There are
many single cases published in the literature that make great savings
claims for radiant systems.  They may be true for a particular building,
but those numbers are not valid for *all* buildings.

As for the delivery losses mentioned in Question 3, without appropriate
insulation radiant systems are known to have problems with heat loss.  Yet
one also has to concede that fans consume quite a bit of energy.  Which
factor dominates?  Again, it depends of various characteristics of the
design.

As far as setback issues are concerned, again it will depend on whether the
system is a high mass system (like one embedded in concrete) or a low mass
ceiling panel system.  It is pretty clear that there is much less
opportunity to effectively use simple setback controls with a high mass
radiant system, but with more sophisticated controls on the system, one
might be able to address these issues.

Finally, I would invite all of those who are interested in radiant heating
and cooling to become active in ASHRAE TC6.5.  It would provide a further
forum to discuss these issues and influence future research in this area.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200404161341.AA4135546pd80000096824@gard.com>

 Well, Mike, you are correct, the difference is small. I went ahead and modeled a two-story 25,000 sf office building in Denver with 50% window-to-wall ratio and low-e double pane windows. The effect of framing with individual windows versus one big window, with the same percentage frame has less than 1% difference in energy usage and cost.  The effect of shading, whether modeled as individual fins on small windows or one big fin for one big window does have about a 2.5% increase in heating usage, however this is offset by cooling reduction, so the overall difference is less than 1% in energy cost. This may have a different effect at different climates. I can email anyone interested the spreadsheet of results.

Has anyone actually done a comparison to see what sort of effect modeling the frame different ways has on the actual loads in the space.  I realize there is no panacea answer but I would be curious to know what the effect of modeling a single window with enlarged frame area vs actual window size and frame width is.  Is it a 5% difference or a 20% or .05%.  I am curious only because I have always assumed the difference was small and that there were more important (larger impact) modeling items to worry about.  
 
Please note that I am not trying to discount the importance of correctly modeling windows but trying to understand the overall impact different modeling techniques might have on output.

Also, if you are using either of the detailed glazing models, the way Steve describes should better account for edge-of-glass effects. Dividing glazing up into lots of tiny little "panes," as some architects want, has an extemely delterious effect on the IGU overall U-factor, above and beyond the effect of the frame itself. If using the SC inputs, it might be instructive to run Window 5 on some similar configurations, to check the overall U-value with DOE2's output. (Noting where interior, exterior etc films are/aren't accounted for.)

If you want a pretty rendering for the client, I recommend a separate model, for presentation only. And then if trying to do daylighting calcs......;

The solution below can work, but does not take into account the effect of shading due to fins and overhangs.  For those windows, a better approach is to define one of the windows, together with its fins/overhang, and then use the window MULTIPLIER to establish the total number of windows on the wall wall.  If the overhang shades a significant portion of the wall, in addition to the window, then the overhang can be defined as a separate shading surface.

Renee,
 
The easiest way to do this is to use a single window on each wall.  Calculate the percentage of window area that is actually frame and then adjust the frame-width to account for the increase.  You may end up with a window frame width that is 12 inches or bigger  (if the wall is large enough).  With a little ingenuity you can write some BDL code that will automatically calculate the window width, frame width and x position of the window on the wall so you don't get any cautions or warnings.  .

Greetings,

I am modeling a high-rise building in eQuest which has a significant amount of fenestration as curtain wall. This curtain wall, like many curtain walls, has metal frames around many small panes of glass that make up the total curtain wall. My question is, how do you treat the frames and the fenestration area?  If I model each small pane of glass and add the exact frame, this would probably overwhelm DOE2 due to the huge number of small windows.  If I model the glass as one big window, then is it correct to just add the total width of the frame to each of these large windows? Also, some of these curtain wall panes have fins to complicate things, so if I do one big glass pane, then adding the fins would make huge fins on either side of the glass. If you have dealt with modeling curtain walls, as probably many of you have, please let me know how you have dealt with these issues.

Thank you,

I'd like to shed some light on the energy saving claim by lowering the
thermostat temperature.
Despite the extensive research conducted sofar on radiant systems, there is
no a definitive answer to this claim.  There has not been an attempt to
break down the energy savings reported in the many research papers: savings
due to thermostat setpoint, transport of energy from the heat source to the
indoor space, efficiency of the heat source, etc.

Lowering the air temperature does not mean lower heat loss/gain to/from the
outside environment.  If one examines the heat balance of the building, the
heat loss/gain is by convection (between indoor air and inside surfaces of
the building envelope) and radiation among inside surfaces.  The radiation
component for radiant systems is more significant than in war-air systems
due to higher inside surface temperatures.  The radiation component may
contribute to warm the inside surfaces of the exterior envelope and
therefore more heat loss to the outside.  There exists a threshold
temperature of the radiant surface (the heated surface) that results in the
same amount of heat loss to the outside, including the ground, as the
warm-air system.  The radiant system is energy saving if the temperature of
the radiant surface is below this threshold temp., otherwise the radiant
system is energy consuming.  Obviously, the threshold temperature depends on
the boundary conditions imposed on the building, the building physical
dimensions and thermal properties of the building construction materials.
It is not known whether or not this threshold temp is within the comfortable
temperature range, or is design-specific so that one can not generalize
savings from one building of x square foot to another building of y square
foot.  Further research in needed.
 
My Second argument is that one can never maintain a constant air temperature
so that the heat loss is constant, especially for residential buildings (I
am excluding confined spaces where the exterior environment conditions
remain quite constant, or ceiling cooling systems where the ceiling does not
directly receive solar radiation) for a simple reason:  Control of the
radiant system is not imposed on the air temperature (contrary to warm-air
systems); the control is imposed on the supply water temperature or on the
heat source (e.g. boiler).  For radiant systems, the air temp. fluctuates
according to the imposed boundary conditions (outdoor temperature, ground
temperature, wind speed, solar radiation, etc.) and water supply
temperature.  In this regard, using steady state condition to design radiant
systems is merely a conservative approach that avoids the worst-case
scenario, and does not guarantee indoor thermal comfort.  Let's say, the
design conditions coincide with nighttime conditions.  Therefore, the indoor
conditions during daytime hours may not be comfortable due to a higher air
temperature (because of the usually higher outdoor temperature and solar
radiation).  Adjusting the thermostat temperature to lower values may not
guarantee thermal comfort too since the response time of the radiant system
is quite slow (in the order or hour compared to in the order of minutes for
war-air systems). This slow response is primarily due to the effect of the
heat storage in the water mass confined in the tubing volume, tubing mass
and slab construction layers.  The other scenario is when the design
conditions coincide with daytime hour, then the system may not deliver a
sufficient amount of energy to maintain the indoor air temperature to an
acceptable level. 

To wrap-up my discussion, an integrated approach combined a dynamic behavior
of radiant system as subject to different controls will bring more insight
on the performance of the system and its energy saving.

I'd like to thank everyone who has contributed information to this
discussion.  It has been very informative for me.  I would like to revisit
one concept to give my thoughts and maybe get some more feedback, and then
I'll give it a rest.

One of the main claims to energy efficiency of a radiant system is the idea
that the thermostat can be set lower than for a forced-air system.  Yet
several people have disagreed with this claim, or said that the reduction is
typically only a couple of degrees.  Some people have also said that the
"two position" thermostat scenario that I described is not correct; that the
actual dynamics of a radiant system are different than what I assumed.

The thermostats I have observed in radiant systems are all simple
two-position thermostats with about 2F hysteresis; they are either "on" or
"off".  Some of these thermostats do not even have a labeled temperature
setpoint, they simply have a band with one end labeled 'colder' and the
other 'warmer'.  So let's look at the following scenario:

1.  The thermostat is set to 67F.  It turns on at 66F and off at 68F.
2.  The weather is mild, the house is floating in the low '70s, and the
thermostat is off.
3.  The weather starts to cool down, and the house temperature starts to
drop.
4.  The house gradually cools to 67F, and reaches equilibrium at that
temperature.  The thermostat never kicks on, because the temperature would
need to drop another degree.
5.  The occupants perceive the house to be cold, and raise the thermostat
setting.  They remember that the original setting felt too cold, so they
never set it back to 67F again.
6.  The thermostat is now set at the same setting as it would be for a
forced-air furnace, and all energy savings that could accrue by having it
lower are never realized.
7.  If they did set the thermostat lower once the weather got colder and the
radiant system was cycling and warming the surfaces, they would run into the
same problem once the weather warmed up for a period.  As soon as the
thermostat climbs above 68F and stays there for a while, the system stays
off, the surfaces cool, and once the space drops to 67F the occupants are
uncomfortable.

Theory predicts that people should be comfortable with a lower thermostat
setting, but field studies find otherwise.  Perhaps the above scenario is
why.

All of the thermostats I have ever seen have a cover that shields the sensor
from radiation; the sensor sees mainly the air temperature.  Are there any
thermostats specifically designed for radiant systems that sense mean
radiant temperature?  If so, how common are they?

The discussion started by Dr. Laouadi has raised several issues related to
radiant heating and cooling systems, and I will attempt to add some of my
own perspective on these concerns raised by the various email
postings.  For those of you who are interested in modeling radiant heating
and cooling systems, a model has been available in EnergyPlus for some time
already and papers have been published regarding this model and its
predecessor model which was part of a research version of the BLAST
program.  Some of these papers are available on the web from the EnergyPlus
web site (www.energyplus.gov) and future papers describing some of the
recent enhancements are in the works.  Follow the link to Documentation and
then to Research Papers and Articles.  As Dr. Laouadi points out, an
integrated radiant model (such as the one found in EnergyPlus) is essential
to answering many of the questions posed here.

In answering Question 1 from Steve, Dr. Laouadi pointed out in his email
from earlier today that in many cases homeowners are not taking advantage
of the potential for lowering their thermostat settings.  That is not
surprising as most homeowners are accustomed to the air systems.  Steve
noted: "But, if the thermostat is lowered to 65F, and the ambient
temperature is 66F, then the radiant heat is off, and the mean radiant
temperature drops."  This is not exactly how the physics of all radiant
systems work.  Systems with any thermal mass will react more slowly than an
"instantaneous" air system.  The occupants will not notice a sudden drop in
temperature because of the mass of the system.  In addition, radiant
systems are not typically "on-off" as forced air systems.  Will there be
greater variation in temperature or comfort?  This depends on
sophistication of the controls and the construction details.  Clearly, more
thought has to be put into the design of a radiant system.  However, a
poorly designed system, whether radiant or conventional forced air, will
not make for a happy building owner.

Question 2 from Steve asked whether the reduced infiltration loss or the
increased surface heat loss will be the determining factor in whether a
radiant system will be more energy efficient.  Or, in a more broader sense,
are radiant systems inherently more efficient than forced air systems.  The
answer is: it depends.  In an ASHRAE paper, I showed that for a particular
case while the average unheated surface temperature did increase slightly
and thus increase the heat loss through those surfaces that the
infiltration losses were higher.  As a result, the radiant system was more
efficient than the conventional forced air system.  But this is by no means
a definitive answer.  It will depend on infiltration rates, exterior
envelope construction, and other details.  The question simply cannot be
answered by a single study--which is why it is important to have simulation
models that can help answer the question for a specific case.  There are
many single cases published in the literature that make great savings
claims for radiant systems.  They may be true for a particular building,
but those numbers are not valid for *all* buildings.

As for the delivery losses mentioned in Question 3, without appropriate
insulation radiant systems are known to have problems with heat loss.  Yet
one also has to concede that fans consume quite a bit of energy.  Which
factor dominates?  Again, it depends of various characteristics of the
design.

As far as setback issues are concerned, again it will depend on whether the
system is a high mass system (like one embedded in concrete) or a low mass
ceiling panel system.  It is pretty clear that there is much less
opportunity to effectively use simple setback controls with a high mass
radiant system, but with more sophisticated controls on the system, one
might be able to address these issues.

Finally, I would invite all of those who are interested in radiant heating
and cooling to become active in ASHRAE TC6.5.  It would provide a further
forum to discuss these issues and influence future research in this area.

Interesting discussion!

I am certainly not an expert on radiant heat, but I did some work on a
radiant heat project about 15 years ago.  I would like to add my two cents
based on that project.

I used BLAST to model the project (a large locomotive overhaul facility)
because of the radiant heat capability and the KSU and Fanger (and maybe
another) Comfort models built into BLAST.  The radiant heaters were high
bay, high temperature gas units set 15 to 20 feet above the floor.  Large
overhead doors to allow the locomotives in and out were open a great deal of
the time.  We assumed a high infiltration rate.

1.  The BLAST Comfort models indicated we could set the thermostat 10
degrees lower than we could with more traditional heat sources.

2.  BLAST modeled a thermostat that incorporated radiant heat, but I could
not get it to work in a stable manor.  For the model, I used a conventional
thermostat set 10 degrees lower (I believe 58 degrees).

3.  I called several suppliers with questions about the radiant thermostats.
I got a general that nobody actually used them because they did not work
very well.  I suspect this could have improved over 15 years.

4.  The BLAST model showed significant savings based on our model, but I
never got any feedback on how well the project worked in real life.

The ongoing discussion has asked some interesting questions about how well
my 15 year ago model did its job.  It also raised some questions about
residential radiant heating.

If my 10 degree assumption is reasonable (not at all a sure thing), the
thermostat would cycle enough to maintain a comfort level.  Obviously, a
wider throttling range would be helpful.

I would suspect the low temperature radiant mentioned for residential would
allow a smaller setback than my high temperature model.  Is low temperature
radiant really much different than baseboard radiators?  If you heat the
slab, how much heat do you lose to the edges and the ground below?

one concept to give my thoughts and maybe get some more feedback, and then
I'll give it a rest.

One of the main claims to energy efficiency of a radiant system is the idea
that the thermostat can be set lower than for a forced-air system.  Yet
several people have disagreed with this claim, or said that the reduction is
typically only a couple of degrees.  Some people have also said that the
"two position" thermostat scenario that I described is not correct; that the
actual dynamics of a radiant system are different than what I assumed.

The thermostats I have observed in radiant systems are all simple
two-position thermostats with about 2F hysteresis; they are either "on" or
"off".  Some of these thermostats do not even have a labeled temperature
setpoint, they simply have a band with one end labeled 'colder' and the
other 'warmer'.  So let's look at the following scenario:

1.  The thermostat is set to 67F.  It turns on at 66F and off at 68F.
2.  The weather is mild, the house is floating in the low '70s, and the
thermostat is off.
3.  The weather starts to cool down, and the house temperature starts to
drop.
4.  The house gradually cools to 67F, and reaches equilibrium at that
temperature.  The thermostat never kicks on, because the temperature would
need to drop another degree.
5.  The occupants perceive the house to be cold, and raise the thermostat
setting.  They remember that the original setting felt too cold, so they
never set it back to 67F again.
6.  The thermostat is now set at the same setting as it would be for a
forced-air furnace, and all energy savings that could accrue by having it
lower are never realized.
7.  If they did set the thermostat lower once the weather got colder and the
radiant system was cycling and warming the surfaces, they would run into the
same problem once the weather warmed up for a period.  As soon as the
thermostat climbs above 68F and stays there for a while, the system stays
off, the surfaces cool, and once the space drops to 67F the occupants are
uncomfortable.

Theory predicts that people should be comfortable with a lower thermostat
setting, but field studies find otherwise.  Perhaps the above scenario is
why.

All of the thermostats I have ever seen have a cover that shields the sensor
from radiation; the sensor sees mainly the air temperature.  Are there any
thermostats specifically designed for radiant systems that sense mean
radiant temperature?  If so, how common are they?

The discussion started by Dr. Laouadi has raised several issues related to
radiant heating and cooling systems, and I will attempt to add some of my
own perspective on these concerns raised by the various email
postings.  For those of you who are interested in modeling radiant heating
and cooling systems, a model has been available in EnergyPlus for some time
already and papers have been published regarding this model and its
predecessor model which was part of a research version of the BLAST
program.  Some of these papers are available on the web from the EnergyPlus
web site (www.energyplus.gov) and future papers describing some of the
recent enhancements are in the works.  Follow the link to Documentation and
then to Research Papers and Articles.  As Dr. Laouadi points out, an
integrated radiant model (such as the one found in EnergyPlus) is essential
to answering many of the questions posed here.

In answering Question 1 from Steve, Dr. Laouadi pointed out in his email
from earlier today that in many cases homeowners are not taking advantage
of the potential for lowering their thermostat settings.  That is not
surprising as most homeowners are accustomed to the air systems.  Steve
noted: "But, if the thermostat is lowered to 65F, and the ambient
temperature is 66F, then the radiant heat is off, and the mean radiant
temperature drops."  This is not exactly how the physics of all radiant
systems work.  Systems with any thermal mass will react more slowly than an
"instantaneous" air system.  The occupants will not notice a sudden drop in
temperature because of the mass of the system.  In addition, radiant
systems are not typically "on-off" as forced air systems.  Will there be
greater variation in temperature or comfort?  This depends on
sophistication of the controls and the construction details.  Clearly, more
thought has to be put into the design of a radiant system.  However, a
poorly designed system, whether radiant or conventional forced air, will
not make for a happy building owner.

Question 2 from Steve asked whether the reduced infiltration loss or the
increased surface heat loss will be the determining factor in whether a
radiant system will be more energy efficient.  Or, in a more broader sense,
are radiant systems inherently more efficient than forced air systems.  The
answer is: it depends.  In an ASHRAE paper, I showed that for a particular
case while the average unheated surface temperature did increase slightly
and thus increase the heat loss through those surfaces that the
infiltration losses were higher.  As a result, the radiant system was more
efficient than the conventional forced air system.  But this is by no means
a definitive answer.  It will depend on infiltration rates, exterior
envelope construction, and other details.  The question simply cannot be
answered by a single study--which is why it is important to have simulation
models that can help answer the question for a specific case.  There are
many single cases published in the literature that make great savings
claims for radiant systems.  They may be true for a particular building,
but those numbers are not valid for *all* buildings.

As for the delivery losses mentioned in Question 3, without appropriate
insulation radiant systems are known to have problems with heat loss.  Yet
one also has to concede that fans consume quite a bit of energy.  Which
factor dominates?  Again, it depends of various characteristics of the
design.

As far as setback issues are concerned, again it will depend on whether the
system is a high mass system (like one embedded in concrete) or a low mass
ceiling panel system.  It is pretty clear that there is much less
opportunity to effectively use simple setback controls with a high mass
radiant system, but with more sophisticated controls on the system, one
might be able to address these issues.

Finally, I would invite all of those who are interested in radiant heating
and cooling to become active in ASHRAE TC6.5.  It would provide a further
forum to discuss these issues and influence future research in this area.

No offense intended, Peter. If you read my statement carefully
you will see some hedging in it. I was remembering back to
when I wrote a proposal to do a study for the ASHRAE radiant
heating TC. I was selected to do the work, but then decided to
decline after some of the TC members began telling me what
the study should reveal. Who knows what I may
have found... probably like Rick, "it depends."

But I wish you the best in your efforts.

Another example of using radiant heating cost-effectively:  We designed a 
home in Wisconsin about 10 years ago that has electrical heating cables 
buried in an insulated sand bed below the concrete floor slab.  The sand 
bed is "charged" with electrical heat at night to take advantage of 
off-peak electrical power rates.  The heat diffuses to the slab surface the 
following day.  The owners report excellent comfort and low heating 
costs.  Unfortunately, no thermal performance data exists for this building.

Not the ones under design. But the patagonia distribution center in Reno Nevada has published data on the energy costs for the 170,000 sf distribution building consumed less energy than the 22,00 sf office buildings. The distribution center was a radiant ceiling panels with displacement ventilation and the office building was traditional rooftop VAV.
I have some data on european buildings that also support the energy reduction of radiant systems. And before you ask the next question, why dont we have any data for American Buildings? the answer is because we havent built enough at present, but we will.

I do not fully agree with this statement. I have been using radiant
systems in buildings for more than 20 years and with the correct
application the energy comsumption compared to a traditional system, say
overhead VAV can vary from 15% to 30% savings. At present, here in
California project such as The Water and Life Museum, Los Angeles Valley
College, Westminster Cultural Center and the Childrens Museum of Los

This is a claim made primarily by the industry making radiant equipment.
I have never seen convincing evidence. It has always seemed to me to be
a second-order effect at best.

It seems that radiant systems are attracting a lot good discussion; I
just wanted to let you all know that ASU recently completed testing a
Radiant Cooled house for an ASHRAE project. A description of that house,
data gathered as well as a good presentation (with several animations)
on radiant systems is available at http://support.caed.asu.edu/radiant

We are now working on a K-6 School using a similar cooling system.

I also have some questions on radiant heating that I hope someone can
answer:

1.  It is well understood that, for a given comfort level, a higher mean
radiant temperature allows for a lower ambient temperature.  This
suggests
that one can lower the thermostat setpoint.  But, if the thermostat is
lowered to 65F, and the ambient temperature is 66F, then the radiant
heat is
off, and the mean radiant temperature drops.  So are the people
comfortable
when the space is 66F, or do they raise the thermostat?

2.  Granted, infiltration heat losses can be lowered by reducing the air
temperature.  But the radiant heat source is also warming the room
surfaces,
including the exterior wall surfaces and window surfaces.  If those
surface
temperatures are then higher than they would be with a convective
heating
system, their conduction losses are now greater, even though the air
temperature is lower.  Also, infiltration/exfiltration losses are
typically
through cracks.  If the cracks in the interior surfaces are warmer from
radiant heating, then the crack warms the exfiltrating air, and space
temperature is not a valid criterion for calculating exfiltration loss.
So
does a radiant heating system REALLY save any energy?

3.  If the radiant elements are imbedded in the ceiling, which is
common,
the interior ceiling temperature can now be in excess of 90F, which
increases the conduction losses to the attic.  So if this loss is
counted as
a delivery loss, the efficiency of the system drops compared to the
theoretical.  The same argument applies to radiant elements in floors.
So
is a radiant system REALLY any more efficient than a convective system
in
terms of delivered energy?

4.  With a setback thermostat and a convective heating system, I can
turn
off the heat at night, but my home will be comfortable in less than a
1/2
hour the next morning.  But most radiant heating systems have a slow
response time.  Do people turn them off/down at night, or do they run
them
continuously?

When looking at cost be sure to compare apples to apples. $1000 for a forced
air unit is on the low side for the unit itself. It likely does not include
installation and most definitely does not include ductwork, grilles, etc.
The $10,000 for the radiant system is more likely a true installed cost.

In many parts of the country a radiant floor system is considered a mark of
a high quality home, and thus the marketing value for the developer/re-sale
can easily outshine any first cost impacts.

For residential, all air systems are probably the most preferred as they are
simple to install. A $1000 for a residential installaion is on the light
side, probably more towards the $10,000 mark which would make a radiant
system very competitive. I think if you look around there are many
successful applications of radiant systems for residential applications. I
know in europe there are many such applications.

Rick,

Thanks for the information.

Given that most houses built today have central air conditioning, the
incremental cost of a forced-air heating unit is very small, probably on the
order of $1,000 for an 80% efficient unit (all of the equipment except for
the furnace must be installed anyway).  A radiant system is probably on the
order of $10,000 additional for a 2,500 sq.ft. house.

Questions:
1.  Did any of the studies you conducted address these costs?  Are they
reasonably accurate?
2.  If they are accurate, can the energy savings of a radiant system make
the system even remotely cost effective?

The discussion started by Dr. Laouadi has raised several issues related to
radiant heating and cooling systems, and I will attempt to add some of my
own perspective on these concerns raised by the various email
postings.  For those of you who are interested in modeling radiant heating
and cooling systems, a model has been available in EnergyPlus for some time
already and papers have been published regarding this model and its
predecessor model which was part of a research version of the BLAST
program.  Some of these papers are available on the web from the EnergyPlus
web site (www.energyplus.gov) and future papers describing some of the
recent enhancements are in the works.  Follow the link to Documentation and
then to Research Papers and Articles.  As Dr. Laouadi points out, an
integrated radiant model (such as the one found in EnergyPlus) is essential
to answering many of the questions posed here.

In answering Question 1 from Steve, Dr. Laouadi pointed out in his email
from earlier today that in many cases homeowners are not taking advantage
of the potential for lowering their thermostat settings.  That is not
surprising as most homeowners are accustomed to the air systems.  Steve
noted: "But, if the thermostat is lowered to 65F, and the ambient
temperature is 66F, then the radiant heat is off, and the mean radiant
temperature drops."  This is not exactly how the physics of all radiant
systems work.  Systems with any thermal mass will react more slowly than an
"instantaneous" air system.  The occupants will not notice a sudden drop in
temperature because of the mass of the system.  In addition, radiant
systems are not typically "on-off" as forced air systems.  Will there be
greater variation in temperature or comfort?  This depends on
sophistication of the controls and the construction details.  Clearly, more
thought has to be put into the design of a radiant system.  However, a
poorly designed system, whether radiant or conventional forced air, will
not make for a happy building owner.

Question 2 from Steve asked whether the reduced infiltration loss or the
increased surface heat loss will be the determining factor in whether a
radiant system will be more energy efficient.  Or, in a more broader sense,
are radiant systems inherently more efficient than forced air systems.  The
answer is: it depends.  In an ASHRAE paper, I showed that for a particular
case while the average unheated surface temperature did increase slightly
and thus increase the heat loss through those surfaces that the
infiltration losses were higher.  As a result, the radiant system was more
efficient than the conventional forced air system.  But this is by no means
a definitive answer.  It will depend on infiltration rates, exterior
envelope construction, and other details.  The question simply cannot be
answered by a single study--which is why it is important to have simulation
models that can help answer the question for a specific case.  There are
many single cases published in the literature that make great savings
claims for radiant systems.  They may be true for a particular building,
but those numbers are not valid for *all* buildings.

As for the delivery losses mentioned in Question 3, without appropriate
insulation radiant systems are known to have problems with heat loss.  Yet
one also has to concede that fans consume quite a bit of energy.  Which
factor dominates?  Again, it depends of various characteristics of the
design.

As far as setback issues are concerned, again it will depend on whether the
system is a high mass system (like one embedded in concrete) or a low mass
ceiling panel system.  It is pretty clear that there is much less
opportunity to effectively use simple setback controls with a high mass
radiant system, but with more sophisticated controls on the system, one
might be able to address these issues.

Finally, I would invite all of those who are interested in radiant heating
and cooling to become active in ASHRAE TC6.5.  It would provide a further
forum to discuss these issues and influence future research in this area.

Cost of radiant systems:

According to the Consumer Energy Information: EREC Reference Briefs, the
cost of installing a radiant floor heating system is approximately $4 to $6
per square foot, depending on the size of the room, the type of
installation, the floor covering, remoteness of the site and the cost of
labor. (additional info may be found in:
http://www.gamanet.org/publist/publistordr.htm).

Steve:

In my studies, I have not looked at the installation costs though such 
information would obviously be an important part of the decision of whether 
or not to install a radiant system.  I have heard the $10,000 number before 
and seem to recall seeing it in an ASHRAE Journal article.  This number 
does seem somewhat high though this may relate more to the lack of 
contractor experience with installing the systems.  I am sure there are 
others who participate in this mail list that can provide better answers to 
this question.

I agree that the cost effectiveness question is a serious issue.  If, due 
to humidity/condensation concerns, it is necessary to use central air 
conditioning, then it seems unlikely that one would go with a completely 
different heating system (i.e., a radiant heating system).  If the radiant 
system will be able to provide both heating and cooling, then it certainly 
seems more likely that a radiant system could be cost effective.  In some 
cases though, some people are willing to spend extra money up front because 
they like some of the features of radiant heating (like, say, the warm 
floor in the winter).

For residential, all air systems are probably the most preferred as they are simple to install. A $1000 for a residential installaion is on the light side, probably more towards the $10,000 mark which would make a radiant system very competitive. I think if you look around there are many successful applications of radiant systems for residential applications. I know in europe there are many such applications.

Rick,

Thanks for the information.

Given that most houses built today have central air conditioning, the
incremental cost of a forced-air heating unit is very small, probably on the
order of $1,000 for an 80% efficient unit (all of the equipment except for
the furnace must be installed anyway).  A radiant system is probably on the
order of $10,000 additional for a 2,500 sq.ft. house.

Questions:
1.  Did any of the studies you conducted address these costs?  Are they
reasonably accurate?
2.  If they are accurate, can the energy savings of a radiant system make
the system even remotely cost effective?

The discussion started by Dr. Laouadi has raised several issues related to
radiant heating and cooling systems, and I will attempt to add some of my
own perspective on these concerns raised by the various email
postings.  For those of you who are interested in modeling radiant heating
and cooling systems, a model has been available in EnergyPlus for some time
already and papers have been published regarding this model and its
predecessor model which was part of a research version of the BLAST
program.  Some of these papers are available on the web from the EnergyPlus
web site (www.energyplus.gov) and future papers describing some of the
recent enhancements are in the works.  Follow the link to Documentation and
then to Research Papers and Articles.  As Dr. Laouadi points out, an
integrated radiant model (such as the one found in EnergyPlus) is essential
to answering many of the questions posed here.

In answering Question 1 from Steve, Dr. Laouadi pointed out in his email
from earlier today that in many cases homeowners are not taking advantage
of the potential for lowering their thermostat settings.  That is not
surprising as most homeowners are accustomed to the air systems.  Steve
noted: "But, if the thermostat is lowered to 65F, and the ambient
temperature is 66F, then the radiant heat is off, and the mean radiant
temperature drops."  This is not exactly how the physics of all radiant
systems work.  Systems with any thermal mass will react more slowly than an
"instantaneous" air system.  The occupants will not notice a sudden drop in
temperature because of the mass of the system.  In addition, radiant
systems are not typically "on-off" as forced air systems.  Will there be
greater variation in temperature or comfort?  This depends on
sophistication of the controls and the construction details.  Clearly, more
thought has to be put into the design of a radiant system.  However, a
poorly designed system, whether radiant or conventional forced air, will
not make for a happy building owner.

Question 2 from Steve asked whether the reduced infiltration loss or the
increased surface heat loss will be the determining factor in whether a
radiant system will be more energy efficient.  Or, in a more broader sense,
are radiant systems inherently more efficient than forced air systems.  The
answer is: it depends.  In an ASHRAE paper, I showed that for a particular
case while the average unheated surface temperature did increase slightly
and thus increase the heat loss through those surfaces that the
infiltration losses were higher.  As a result, the radiant system was more
efficient than the conventional forced air system.  But this is by no means
a definitive answer.  It will depend on infiltration rates, exterior
envelope construction, and other details.  The question simply cannot be
answered by a single study--which is why it is important to have simulation
models that can help answer the question for a specific case.  There are
many single cases published in the literature that make great savings
claims for radiant systems.  They may be true for a particular building,
but those numbers are not valid for *all* buildings.

As for the delivery losses mentioned in Question 3, without appropriate
insulation radiant systems are known to have problems with heat loss.  Yet
one also has to concede that fans consume quite a bit of energy.  Which
factor dominates?  Again, it depends of various characteristics of the
design.

As far as setback issues are concerned, again it will depend on whether the
system is a high mass system (like one embedded in concrete) or a low mass
ceiling panel system.  It is pretty clear that there is much less
opportunity to effectively use simple setback controls with a high mass
radiant system, but with more sophisticated controls on the system, one
might be able to address these issues.

Finally, I would invite all of those who are interested in radiant heating
and cooling to become active in ASHRAE TC6.5.  It would provide a further
forum to discuss these issues and influence future research in this area.

I do not fully agree with this statement. I have been using radiant systems in buildings for more than 20 years and with the correct application the energy comsumption compared to a traditional system, say overhead VAV can vary from 15% to 30% savings. At present, here in California project such as The Water and Life Museum, Los Angeles Valley College, Westminster Cultural Center and the Childrens Museum of Los Angeles are all showing substantial savings when integrating radiant systems into the designs (compared to an overhead VAV system. Most of these designs are primarily cooling dominated and that probably makes this statement very suprising and of course I am bias. I have published several ASHRAE papers on the potential savings and increased comfort of radiant systems. Another little project I forgot to mention was the Bangkok airport project which will have about 270,000 m2 of radinat cooled floor and the predicted energy savings were in the order of 40%.
I dont think this forum is a place to say mine is bigger than yours, but Rick Strand and David Sheatzle have been very progressive in trying to get a radiant model in energyplus. A model that works and one that can be applied by enginerrs designing real buildings.

This is a claim made primarily by the industry making radiant
equipment. I have never seen convincing evidence. It has always
seemed to me to be a second-order effect at best.

Steve:

In my studies, I have not looked at the installation costs though such 
information would obviously be an important part of the decision of whether 
or not to install a radiant system.  I have heard the $10,000 number before 
and seem to recall seeing it in an ASHRAE Journal article.  This number 
does seem somewhat high though this may relate more to the lack of 
contractor experience with installing the systems.  I am sure there are 
others who participate in this mail list that can provide better answers to 
this question.

I agree that the cost effectiveness question is a serious issue.  If, due 
to humidity/condensation concerns, it is necessary to use central air 
conditioning, then it seems unlikely that one would go with a completely 
different heating system (i.e., a radiant heating system).  If the radiant 
system will be able to provide both heating and cooling, then it certainly 
seems more likely that a radiant system could be cost effective.  In some 
cases though, some people are willing to spend extra money up front because 
they like some of the features of radiant heating (like, say, the warm 
floor in the winter).

Rick,

Thanks for the information.

Given that most houses built today have central air conditioning, the
incremental cost of a forced-air heating unit is very small, probably on the
order of $1,000 for an 80% efficient unit (all of the equipment except for
the furnace must be installed anyway).  A radiant system is probably on the
order of $10,000 additional for a 2,500 sq.ft. house.

Questions:
1.  Did any of the studies you conducted address these costs?  Are they
reasonably accurate?
2.  If they are accurate, can the energy savings of a radiant system make
the system even remotely cost effective?

The discussion started by Dr. Laouadi has raised several issues related to
radiant heating and cooling systems, and I will attempt to add some of my
own perspective on these concerns raised by the various email
postings.  For those of you who are interested in modeling radiant heating
and cooling systems, a model has been available in EnergyPlus for some time
already and papers have been published regarding this model and its
predecessor model which was part of a research version of the BLAST
program.  Some of these papers are available on the web from the EnergyPlus
web site (www.energyplus.gov) and future papers describing some of the
recent enhancements are in the works.  Follow the link to Documentation and
then to Research Papers and Articles.  As Dr. Laouadi points out, an
integrated radiant model (such as the one found in EnergyPlus) is essential
to answering many of the questions posed here.

In answering Question 1 from Steve, Dr. Laouadi pointed out in his email
from earlier today that in many cases homeowners are not taking advantage
of the potential for lowering their thermostat settings.  That is not
surprising as most homeowners are accustomed to the air systems.  Steve
noted: "But, if the thermostat is lowered to 65F, and the ambient
temperature is 66F, then the radiant heat is off, and the mean radiant
temperature drops."  This is not exactly how the physics of all radiant
systems work.  Systems with any thermal mass will react more slowly than an
"instantaneous" air system.  The occupants will not notice a sudden drop in
temperature because of the mass of the system.  In addition, radiant
systems are not typically "on-off" as forced air systems.  Will there be
greater variation in temperature or comfort?  This depends on
sophistication of the controls and the construction details.  Clearly, more
thought has to be put into the design of a radiant system.  However, a
poorly designed system, whether radiant or conventional forced air, will
not make for a happy building owner.

Question 2 from Steve asked whether the reduced infiltration loss or the
increased surface heat loss will be the determining factor in whether a
radiant system will be more energy efficient.  Or, in a more broader sense,
are radiant systems inherently more efficient than forced air systems.  The
answer is: it depends.  In an ASHRAE paper, I showed that for a particular
case while the average unheated surface temperature did increase slightly
and thus increase the heat loss through those surfaces that the
infiltration losses were higher.  As a result, the radiant system was more
efficient than the conventional forced air system.  But this is by no means
a definitive answer.  It will depend on infiltration rates, exterior
envelope construction, and other details.  The question simply cannot be
answered by a single study--which is why it is important to have simulation
models that can help answer the question for a specific case.  There are
many single cases published in the literature that make great savings
claims for radiant systems.  They may be true for a particular building,
but those numbers are not valid for *all* buildings.

As for the delivery losses mentioned in Question 3, without appropriate
insulation radiant systems are known to have problems with heat loss.  Yet
one also has to concede that fans consume quite a bit of energy.  Which
factor dominates?  Again, it depends of various characteristics of the
design.

As far as setback issues are concerned, again it will depend on whether the
system is a high mass system (like one embedded in concrete) or a low mass
ceiling panel system.  It is pretty clear that there is much less
opportunity to effectively use simple setback controls with a high mass
radiant system, but with more sophisticated controls on the system, one
might be able to address these issues.

Finally, I would invite all of those who are interested in radiant heating
and cooling to become active in ASHRAE TC6.5.  It would provide a further
forum to discuss these issues and influence future research in this area.

This is a claim made primarily by the industry making radiant
equipment. I have never seen convincing evidence. It has always
seemed to me to be a second-order effect at best.

I also have some questions on radiant heating that I hope someone can
answer:

1.  It is well understood that, for a given comfort level, a higher mean
radiant temperature allows for a lower ambient temperature. This is not quite true. The radiant component either heating or cooling can balance the mean radinat tempertaure exchange in a space. Onec the MRT has been balanced, incresed for heating or lowered for cooling then the space temperature can be adjusted to an optimum temperature as long as the occupant comfort remains within PMV=/- 0.5. Typical values for heating would be about 68F and for cooling about 78F.

This suggests
that one can lower the thermostat setpoint. yes But, if the thermostat is
lowered to 65F, and the ambient temperature is 66F, then the radiant heat is
off, and the mean radiant temperature drops.  Not if the solar gain to the space remains.

So are the people comfortable
when the space is 66F This would be calculated, my gut feeling would be that 66F would be pushing the minmum PMV of - 0.5., or do they raise the thermostat? most propbably but to what tmperature, most humans would reset to say 70F and this would be a slight overkill, us engineers would be happy with 68F. The point here is the very gery area we now find ourselves in. The new ASHRAE standard 55 reverts back to the PMV +/- 0.5 identical with ISO 7730 which then states comfort criteria for a space as opposed to dry bulb temperatures being used to dictate space conditions and sometimes hopfully comfort.

2.  Granted, infiltration heat losses can be lowered by reducing the air
temperature. Infiltration will not be reduced by lowering the air tempertaure however the effect of possible infiltration would be reduced. The heat losses would be reduced if lower temperatures were used. But the radiant heat source is also warming the room surfaces,
including the exterior wall surfaces and window surfaces.  Good point, however, most programs and engineers are incapable of calculating this. My experince has been that the inside surface temperature is calculated using the component u value, the temparture differential across the component and then using the heat transfer coefficient of the inside surface to calculate the inside surface temperature. There is another longer explanation which is basically the diffrenece between  the  responese method of calulation against forward finite element. If those surface
temperatures are then higher than they would be with a convective heating
system, their conduction losses are now greater, even though the air
temperature is lower. correct, but what are we heating the space or the losses. In simple terms if a space were calculated to maintain say 70F at outside conditions of say 20F ( not for californians), then the dalta t = 90F and the heat loss from the space is calculated. Now if the inside space temperature is reduced to say 68F then the delta t= 88F and the calculated heat losses would be slightly less. The discussion being that the heat losses to the exterior would be slightly higher if the surface temperatues were higher, I would agree, but the heat gain to the space or heat loss (assuming the laws of thermodynamics havent changed this week) would be slightly less as the relationship between space temperature and inside surface temperature would be decreased. Also, infiltration/exfiltration losses are typically
through cracks.  If the cracks in the interior surfaces are warmer from
radiant heating, then the crack warms the exfiltrating air, and space
temperature is not a valid criterion for calculating exfiltration loss.  So
does a radiant heating system REALLY save any energy?

3.  If the radiant elements are imbedded in the ceiling, which is common,
the interior ceiling temperature can now be in excess of 90F, which
increases the conduction losses to the attic.  So if this loss is counted as
a delivery loss, the efficiency of the system drops compared to the
theoretical.  The same argument applies to radiant elements in floors.  So
is a radiant system REALLY any more efficient than a convective system in
terms of delivered energy?

4.  With a setback thermostat and a convective heating system, I can turn
off the heat at night, but my home will be comfortable in less than a 1/2
hour the next morning.  But most radiant heating systems have a slow
response time.  Do people turn them off/down at night, or do they run them
continuously?

The discussion started by Dr. Laouadi has raised several issues related to 
radiant heating and cooling systems, and I will attempt to add some of my 
own perspective on these concerns raised by the various email 
postings.  For those of you who are interested in modeling radiant heating 
and cooling systems, a model has been available in EnergyPlus for some time 
already and papers have been published regarding this model and its 
predecessor model which was part of a research version of the BLAST 
program.  Some of these papers are available on the web from the EnergyPlus 
web site (www.energyplus.gov) and future papers describing some of the 
recent enhancements are in the works.  Follow the link to Documentation and 
then to Research Papers and Articles.  As Dr. Laouadi points out, an 
integrated radiant model (such as the one found in EnergyPlus) is essential 
to answering many of the questions posed here.

In answering Question 1 from Steve, Dr. Laouadi pointed out in his email 
from earlier today that in many cases homeowners are not taking advantage 
of the potential for lowering their thermostat settings.  That is not 
surprising as most homeowners are accustomed to the air systems.  Steve 
noted: "But, if the thermostat is lowered to 65F, and the ambient 
temperature is 66F, then the radiant heat is off, and the mean radiant 
temperature drops."  This is not exactly how the physics of all radiant 
systems work.  Systems with any thermal mass will react more slowly than an 
"instantaneous" air system.  The occupants will not notice a sudden drop in 
temperature because of the mass of the system.  In addition, radiant 
systems are not typically "on-off" as forced air systems.  Will there be 
greater variation in temperature or comfort?  This depends on 
sophistication of the controls and the construction details.  Clearly, more 
thought has to be put into the design of a radiant system.  However, a 
poorly designed system, whether radiant or conventional forced air, will 
not make for a happy building owner.

Question 2 from Steve asked whether the reduced infiltration loss or the 
increased surface heat loss will be the determining factor in whether a 
radiant system will be more energy efficient.  Or, in a more broader sense, 
are radiant systems inherently more efficient than forced air systems.  The 
answer is: it depends.  In an ASHRAE paper, I showed that for a particular 
case while the average unheated surface temperature did increase slightly 
and thus increase the heat loss through those surfaces that the 
infiltration losses were higher.  As a result, the radiant system was more 
efficient than the conventional forced air system.  But this is by no means 
a definitive answer.  It will depend on infiltration rates, exterior 
envelope construction, and other details.  The question simply cannot be 
answered by a single study--which is why it is important to have simulation 
models that can help answer the question for a specific case.  There are 
many single cases published in the literature that make great savings 
claims for radiant systems.  They may be true for a particular building, 
but those numbers are not valid for *all* buildings.

As for the delivery losses mentioned in Question 3, without appropriate 
insulation radiant systems are known to have problems with heat loss.  Yet 
one also has to concede that fans consume quite a bit of energy.  Which 
factor dominates?  Again, it depends of various characteristics of the design.

As far as setback issues are concerned, again it will depend on whether the 
system is a high mass system (like one embedded in concrete) or a low mass 
ceiling panel system.  It is pretty clear that there is much less 
opportunity to effectively use simple setback controls with a high mass 
radiant system, but with more sophisticated controls on the system, one 
might be able to address these issues.

Finally, I would invite all of those who are interested in radiant heating 
and cooling to become active in ASHRAE TC6.5.  It would provide a further 
forum to discuss these issues and influence future research in this area.

Caroline,

I'm afraid that within the constraints of the Energy-10 user interface, 
you will not be able to effectively model your lightshelves.  The 
shading overhangs that can be defined within Energy-10 will only block 
light from reaching the window below the overhang.  They will not 
reflect light up through the window above them.

Using a high ground reflectance to approximate the upward reflection of 
light from a light shelf is at best only that - an approximation.  It 
will also incorrectly cause additional light to reflect into the lowest 
window, which is typically the largest glazed area, probably causing a 
larger error in your final results than you would get with a more 
accurate ground reflectance.

My 2c:
One aspect that should save energy on a radiant hydronic system is that your
supply and return water temps are lower year round than in a typical
convective system.  If you consider a condensing hydronic boiler, you should
always be in condensing mode with radiant heat, but your HW reset schedule
for other forms of hydronic heat would mean you would not be condensing
except when OA temps are relatively high (Above 40F?).  Therefore, boiler
efficiency should be better with radiant for most of the heating season.

You raise some good points about the other issues.  I've only heard the
lower space temperature setpoint argument when it comes to spaces like
manufacturing areas, ice rinks, airplane hangars, etc.  Don't think it would
apply so much to residential, especially if you are going to cycle zone
valves on and off.  Modulating zone valves?

The realistic energy saving of radiant systems when compared to warm air
systems is not an easy task to conduct as it depends not only on the
physical characteristics of the building and HVAC system, but also on
occupant behavior vis-?-vis the control of the radiant system.  It is well
known that the main claim by radiant system designers and manufacturers is
that the energy saving may be achieved by lowering the thermostat set point
temperature.  However, recent research has showed that it is not the case
(see for example SOLPLAN REVIEW journal, March 2001): homeowners with
radiant heating systems do not set their thermostat temperature
significantly lower than homeowners with other type of heating systems.  In
addition people tend to like the surface warmth the radiant system create,
and therefore extending the heating season and the annual energy cost.

To get a realistic picture on the energy performance of radiant systems, an
integrated approach should be sought.  The integrated approach should
account for the heat transport from the heat source to the radiant surface,
from the radiant surface to the indoor air, from the indoor air to the
exterior environment, and the dynamic control of the radiant system.
Nowadays, energy simulation software offer this opportunity.  The radiant
model, which is the subject of this discussion, was specifically developed
for energy simulation software. The model handles in a detailed and dynamic
way (transient) the heat transfer from the heat source (e.g. boiler) to the
slab through tubing, and from tubing to the construction layers of the slab.
Other heat transfers,  including building heat loss from the indoor air to
the exterior, and the control of the radiant system are taken care by the
energy simulation software.  Combining of a detailed radiant heating/cooling
model with energy simulation software offers many features and design
flexibilities to the designer, namely: (1)- examine the dynamic behavior of
radiant systems (for example, nighttime setback temperature, or exterior
temperature variations, ON/OFF control, etc., and its impact on the response
time and energy consumption).  It should be noted that the current design of
radiant systems is based only on steady state behavior (e.g., ASHRAE
Standard 152). (2)- explore any possible control type on the energy
performance of radiant system.  For example, if the energy simulation
software provides calculation of thermal comfort indices (MRT temperature,
Operative temp., PMV, or PPD), then one may use these outputs to control the
radiant system, and double check the energy saving potential of radiant
systems upon lowering the set point temp. (3)- Design a radiant system for
specific building location, by taking into account the local weather data.
This just to name a few.

Reply to specific questions:

Q: Does the model have the capability of
simulating a variety of insulation approaches?  There is a great need for
information on when, where, and how much insulation to apply.

A: Yes it does. In fact there is no limit on the construction layers of the
radiant surface (e.g., flooring, back insulation, etc.) as long as it can be
handled by the energy simulation software.  However, peripheral (edge)
insulations are not accounted for in the model.  The model assumes the edges
of the radiant surface are adiabatic (well insulated).

Q: In your research with radiant heating cooling savings, have you found any

energy "savings" that can be attributed directly to the use of the radiant 
system vs other systems (air supply in particular).

A: I have not done myself any research on the comparison of radiant systems
with warm air systems.  However, there are some theoretical research that
claim that radiant systems save more energy than conventional ones.

Subject: Radiant heating modeling paper


Mr. Laouad,

I received and briefly reviewed your paper (I will take a more thorough look

when I have more time).  This is a topic that interests me greatly.  I have
some questions and observations.  Does the model have the capability of
simulating a variety of insulation approaches?  There is a great need for
information on when, where, and how much insulation to apply.  We are
planning to develop a  "slab edge insulation form" under work we are doing
under the Department of Energy 'Building America' program and will need to
estimate the benefits.  

It seems that output from your model could improve upon what is currently
included in ASHRAE Standard 152 (hydronic section prepared by John Andrews
and Birol Kilkis).  I believe it is inadequate to represent radiant floor
efficiency at the same level that the standard can be used to represent
duct efficiency.

I have several months of monitoring data from my own house that includes
both radiant heating and radiant cooling, if you are interested in using it
for model calibration.  Unfortunately the surface temperature measurement
is not very good.

I forwarded your paper to Larry Drake at the Radiant Panel Association.  I
am sure he will be interested in publishing a review in the monthly
association newsletter.

I also have some questions on radiant heating that I hope someone can
answer:

1.  It is well understood that, for a given comfort level, a higher mean
radiant temperature allows for a lower ambient temperature.  This suggests
that one can lower the thermostat setpoint.  But, if the thermostat is
lowered to 65F, and the ambient temperature is 66F, then the radiant heat is
off, and the mean radiant temperature drops.  So are the people comfortable
when the space is 66F, or do they raise the thermostat?

2.  Granted, infiltration heat losses can be lowered by reducing the air
temperature.  But the radiant heat source is also warming the room surfaces,
including the exterior wall surfaces and window surfaces.  If those surface
temperatures are then higher than they would be with a convective heating
system, their conduction losses are now greater, even though the air
temperature is lower.  Also, infiltration/exfiltration losses are typically
through cracks.  If the cracks in the interior surfaces are warmer from
radiant heating, then the crack warms the exfiltrating air, and space
temperature is not a valid criterion for calculating exfiltration loss.  So
does a radiant heating system REALLY save any energy?

3.  If the radiant elements are imbedded in the ceiling, which is common,
the interior ceiling temperature can now be in excess of 90F, which
increases the conduction losses to the attic.  So if this loss is counted as
a delivery loss, the efficiency of the system drops compared to the
theoretical.  The same argument applies to radiant elements in floors.  So
is a radiant system REALLY any more efficient than a convective system in
terms of delivered energy?

4.  With a setback thermostat and a convective heating system, I can turn
off the heat at night, but my home will be comfortable in less than a 1/2
hour the next morning.  But most radiant heating systems have a slow
response time.  Do people turn them off/down at night, or do they run them
continuously?

I am curious how you modelled the performance of the gas fired radiant tube
heating. My experience has been that conventional load calculation and
simulation techniques do not work well with these systems.

I have modeled the savings for radiant systems for unvented low intensity
gas fired radiant tube heating systems in high bay warehouses and
manufacturing facilities in particular by:

    1. Reducing the setpoint dry bulb temperature a few degrees because
human comfort with radiant heating is reached at a lower ambient than with
convection heating systems.  I am certain that comfort research supports
this.
    2. Reducing the setpoint temperature a few more degrees because there is
less floor-to-ceiling temperature stratification. With the desired
temperature at belly button level, radiant systems will have a lower average
temperature floor-to-ceiling than unit heaters overall.
    3. Reducing the amount of infiltration, due to reduced stack effect, due
to reduced temperature stratification
    4. Increasing the heating system combustion efficiency slightly due to
having no intermediate media such as air or water between the combustion air
and the space to be heated and lack of venting.

While I cannot cite studies to validate the adjustments or quantify them
generally (though I have rules of thumb based on ceiling height), such an
approach has predicted savings roughly in the right ballpark, close enough
to make a do/don't do decision at least.

Would love to be able to cite rigorous research that proves or disproves my
approach.

In your research with radiant heating cooling savings, have you found any
energy "savings" that can be attributed directly to the use of the radiant
system vs other systems (air supply in particular).  For example, I have
seen some papers that note that the heating setpoint can be relaxed while
still maintaining thermal comfort with a radiant system.

Anna,

I do not know the intricacies of how DOE 2.2 models work, however I have
seen this sort of thing happen with other energy simulation software. The
greater degree of control that you get with a VAV system means that more
zones are controlled to their respective cooling setpoints. Many people
forget this but better zoning and better thermostatic control of a building
usually costs more energy than a system with poor zoning control, like a
SZCV unit for instance. Often a single zone constant volume system will use
the least amount of energy when compared to other systems and will likewise
have the poorest comfort control as it controls to the average temperature
or only to the temperature at the location of the thermostat, while all
other areas are not controlled properly. The savings of VAV generally
relates to fan energy, which is generally a third of the total HVAC energy.
Depending on how much load diversity you have with that building, and the
VAV box turndown ratio, the VAV system may save enough fan energy to
overcome the additional cooling energy required to maintain the thermostat
setpoints in all the VAV zones. VAV systems should be primarily justified on
comfort. Energy is a secondary consideration, in my opinion. 

One final thought: if the VAV box turndown is too low this will likely
reduce the economizer air (free cooling) that you are getting from
ventilation since the ventilation rate is generally proportional to total
supply air quantity. If this turndown is below that required to condition
the building the compressors will have to make up the deficit in the
cooling, resulting in higher energy costs. In some cases, especially in
cooler climates, increasing the ventilation rate has the effect of actually
saving energy as this acts as an economizer.

Regards,

Craig J. Gann, P.E.

Hi,There

When doing simulation, I noticed that the cooling energy consumption from a
variable air volumn system (VAV,PVAVS) is always larger than that of a
constant volume system (PSZ). Did anybody have this problem, too? Can
anybody tell me what's the possible cause of this?

Thanks a lot.

Anna,

In your experiment, did you use 5 PSZ systems (one for each zone)?  If not,
one zone will be the thermostat zone and control the supply air temperature.
You will probably have temperature control problems in the other zones.

If you are not already looking at it, take a look at the PS-E report in the
.sim output file. This report breaks down the total building energy into
several components including lighting, heating, cooling, fans, etc.  I like
to pull that report into an Excel spreadsheet and create a stacked bar graph
to show the monthly energy consumption.  eQUEST can do the same thing with
the Single Run Report, Monthly Energy Consumption.  Seeing how much energy
you are using for cooling, fans, lights, etc. can be very helpful.

Of course many of the components of the simulation model will affect energy
use in other components.  For example, the default static pressure for a VAV
system is higher than for a PSZ system.  That higher static translates to
fan heat and thus more cooling.

I am not real sure what you are looking for, but, in general, I would expect
economizers to save energy for either system.  I would expect a VAV system
to use less fan energy, even with the higher static, because it does not
have to move as much air in total.

The control sequence for a VAV system will be as follows:
1.  The supply air temperature comes first.  It will be fixed, reset by OA
temperature, scheduled by you, or set to meet the requirements of the
warmest zone.
2.  The economizer will mix outside air and return air if OA temperature is
below a maximum (around 65 degrees).  It will try to bring the mixed air
temperature to the supply air temperature.
3.  If the supply air temperature is not as cool as required by step 1., the
cooling coils will bring the temperature down to that temperature.
4.  The VAV box at the zone will throttle the air between 100% flow and a
minimum flow (defaulted or specified by you) to maintain proper space
temperature.
5.  If the minimum flow will overcool the space, reheat kicks in to bring up
the supply air temperature to maintain the proper space temperature.

That is the simple VAV.  You can make it more complicated with fan powered
VAV boxes, or a reverse acting thermostat.  Some of these options allow you
to increase air flow above minimum when heating.  That can be helpful in
some situations, such as low minimum flows or climates cold enough to
require heating.

As I said earlier, I am not real sure what you are looking for.  I hope I am
not heading off in the wrong direction.  Let me know if I can be any more
help.

Mike

Mike,

I did experiment by using a 5-zone 1-story building, assigning each zone to
a system in both In the PSZ system case and the PVAVS system case and
resetting the supply air temperature to a higher upper bound to avoid
reheat. it does bring down the cooling energy consumption of the PVAVS, but
the total energy consumption is still higher (each month) than the PSZ.
This is when both PSZ and PVAVS are using OA-temp economizer.

Then, by disable the economizer, the cooling energy consumptions from PVAVS
and PSZ are brought closer to each other. This shows as if the control of
PVAVS in DOE2 tries to reduce air flow first instead of using more outside
air when the outside is cool.But still the PVAVS cooling energy is always
slightly higher than PSZ (under California climate zone 1).I just cann't see
a case that PVAVS uses less energy than PSZ.

Also, doe this say when there are economizers,it's better to use constant
volume rather that variable volume? What's the typical control sequence of a
VAV system among: volume decreasing, temperature reset and economizer? Can
we specify in DOE2 the sequence we want?

Thanks for your reply.

Anna

Anna,

A PSZ (Packaged Single Zone) system is constant volume, but only has to cool
when the space calls for cooling.  A VAVS system cools the air all the time
(or may use an economizer part of the time), then reheats the air to the
temperature the space requires.  You can improve on this by resetting the
cold deck temperature, but will probably not get your cooling below a single
zone system.  For comparison, try a RHFS system.  That is a constant volume
system, but cools all the air, then reheats it to satisfy the zone.  It will
generally use more cooling than the VAVS system.

Both DOE-2.1 and DOE-2.2 have some fairly extensive documentation on
controls, related to how the programs control real world systems.

I have modeled the savings for radiant systems for unvented low intensity
gas fired radiant tube heating systems in high bay warehouses and
manufacturing facilities in particular by:

    1. Reducing the setpoint dry bulb temperature a few degrees because
human comfort with radiant heating is reached at a lower ambient than with
convection heating systems.  I am certain that comfort research supports
this.
    2. Reducing the setpoint temperature a few more degrees because there is
less floor-to-ceiling temperature stratification. With the desired
temperature at belly button level, radiant systems will have a lower average
temperature floor-to-ceiling than unit heaters overall.
    3. Reducing the amount of infiltration, due to reduced stack effect, due
to reduced temperature stratification
    4. Increasing the heating system combustion efficiency slightly due to
having no intermediate media such as air or water between the combustion air
and the space to be heated and lack of venting.

While I cannot cite studies to validate the adjustments or quantify them
generally (though I have rules of thumb based on ceiling height), such an
approach has predicted savings roughly in the right ballpark, close enough
to make a do/don't do decision at least.

Would love to be able to cite rigorous research that proves or disproves my
approach.

In your research with radiant heating cooling savings, have you found any
energy "savings" that can be attributed directly to the use of the radiant
system vs other systems (air supply in particular).  For example, I have
seen some papers that note that the heating setpoint can be relaxed while
still maintaining thermal comfort with a radiant system.

Mike,

I did experiment by using a 5-zone 1-story building, assigning each zone to
a system in both In the PSZ system case and the PVAVS system case and
resetting the supply air temperature to a higher upper bound to avoid
reheat. it does bring down the cooling energy consumption of the PVAVS, but
the total energy consumption is still higher (each month) than the PSZ.
This is when both PSZ and PVAVS are using OA-temp economizer.

Then, by disable the economizer, the cooling energy consumptions from PVAVS
and PSZ are brought closer to each other. This shows as if the control of
PVAVS in DOE2 tries to reduce air flow first instead of using more outside
air when the outside is cool.But still the PVAVS cooling energy is always
slightly higher than PSZ (under California climate zone 1).I just cann't see
a case that PVAVS uses less energy than PSZ.

Also, doe this say when there are economizers,it's better to use constant
volume rather that variable volume? What's the typical control sequence of a
VAV system among: volume decreasing, temperature reset and economizer? Can
we specify in DOE2 the sequence we want?

Thanks for your reply.

Anna

Anna,

A PSZ (Packaged Single Zone) system is constant volume, but only has to cool
when the space calls for cooling.  A VAVS system cools the air all the time
(or may use an economizer part of the time), then reheats the air to the
temperature the space requires.  You can improve on this by resetting the
cold deck temperature, but will probably not get your cooling below a single
zone system.  For comparison, try a RHFS system.  That is a constant volume
system, but cools all the air, then reheats it to satisfy the zone.  It will
generally use more cooling than the VAVS system.

Both DOE-2.1 and DOE-2.2 have some fairly extensive documentation on
controls, related to how the programs control real world systems.

Hi,There

When doing simulation, I noticed that the cooling energy consumption from a
variable air volumn system (VAV,PVAVS) is always larger than that of a
constant volume system (PSZ). Did anybody have this problem, too? Can
anybody tell me what's the possible cause of this?

Thanks a lot.

Caroline,

The algorithms used in the Energy-10 daylighting calculations are based 
on those used in DOE2.1.  These algorithms account for interior surface 
reflectance by using the so-called "split-flux" method of calculating 
the effects of interreflection.  The surface reflectance is user 
modifiable within the daylighting zone dialog boxes.  Under the 
"Buildings" menu select "Bldg2" and then click the "Lighting Zones" 
button.  On the "Lighting Zones" dialog select a lighting zone from the 
list, and click the "Modify" button.  On the "Lighting Zone Details" 
dialog click the "Surfaces" button.  On the "Daylighting Surfaces" 
dialog select a Daylighting Surface from the list on the lower right and 
you can edit the Interior, Exterior, and Ground reflectance values for 
that surface.  Yes, I know this is painful.

Caroline,

Energy-10 daylighting calculation results should definitely be different 
for different orientations within a given building for a given exterior 
daylight availability condition.  I am not sure what "DF%" values you 
are referring to in your message below.  I just did a simple test of 
creating a default square building with identical aperture glazing types 
and sizes on all orientations.  When I scan through the resulting *.FC 
file containing the illuminance values (in footcandles) for each 
lighting zone, for each simulation timestep, I see different illuminance 
levels in each of the lighting zones for each timestep.  Since the 
exterior horizontal illuminance is fixed for a given timestep, and since 
the illuminance levels are calculated by multiplying that exterior 
horizontal illuminance by the Daylight Factor(s) for each lighting zone, 
it follows that the Daylight Factors are indeed different for different 
orientations.

Caroline,

A description of the method used by the Daylighting EES Apply is given 
in the Energy-10 Help under the Daylighting section.  You should pay 
particular attention to the "Lighting Zone Default Geometry" section, 
which describes how this Apply method establishes a small daylighting 
zone module on each orientation that is used to calculate daylight 
factors for each orientation.  This means that only those apertures that 
are part of a daylighting zone module will affect the daylight factors 
for that orientation.  Changing the glazing type in other apertures on 
the orientation will not change the daylight factors within the 
established daylighting zone, but WILL change the overall thermal 
gains/losses within the building.  This will result in a mis-match 
between the daylighting and thermal calculation results.

The Apply should only be used for building geometries that have been 
created by the default building generator.  This is not a suitable 
approach for the type of daylighting specific studies you are attempting 
to undertake.  You should manually input your own daylighting zones for 
buildings that are different from the default building, and for 
buildings in which you want to use different glazing types on the facade 
of each orientation.

Question for Energy 10 users:
On Summary Output page, I am not getting natural gas consumption values
for domestic hot water or heating systems - only total.  On Fuel
hw/heat/total line, NC/NC/333461 is printed.  Yet when I look at
detailed report output, values are listed for domestic hot water and
heating system.  Does anyone know why natural gas consumption values are
not listed on Summary Output page?

This thread just prompted me to update the archive (it had 
been a while, sorry).  The archives are at:

http://www.gard.com/ml/bldg-sim-archive/threads.html

http://www.gard.com/ml/bldg-sim-archive/maillist.html

I prefer email lists so I guess that is why I started BLDG-
SIM that way. I tend to watch forums for a week or two and 
then forget to go back them.  I like that the messages from 
BLDG-SIM show up in my inbox and demand some small amount 
of attention.  I do wish the archives were better organized 
and self maintaining. 

If you want to search the archives try doing what I do and 
use Google:

  site:GARD.COM BLDG-SIM topic

but put in a real topic.

As far as budget to maintain BLDG-SIM, it is zero. It is 
piggy-backed on expenses GARD would have had for a mail 
server and web site plus my own personal time.

A way to get surveys done and a way to upload files to 
share with everyone would be advantages to a forum but I 
don't know if it worth the possible loss of eyeballs.

I'll add my voice to the crowd - the Bldg-Sim list has been valuable to me
as a means of monitoring what goes on in the "real-world" simulation world.
It's fairly easy for me to quickly look at a posting and figure out whether
I want to read it or not.
 
Unless a web-based forum offered the capability to have all postings emailed
to me, I doubt that I'd have the initiative to go to the website and figure
out what's new since the last time I was there.
 
That being said - there certainly is value in categorizing and archiving the
materials to make the information more accessible.  I'd just hate to see my
particular use-case degraded because of it.

I agree with chip - the value of having something pop up in your email is
huge. I probably wouldn't bother to visit the forum site as much. Also, a
lot of times people send attachments by email in response to questions. This
might not be viable for a forum site. I still think there are benefits to
the forum though - the most important being the archive of threads. Jason -
do you have the infrastructure to build an archive?

Alec et al --

I agree with all of your points.

However, one of the values of the eMail format is that activity announces
itself.  When a message appears, I take a moment to read it.  If I have
something to add, I answer.

I imagine that I would rarely go read a forum unless I had a specific
question or issue.

Can forums be set up so they send an occasional eMail noting that 42 new
postings have appeared in the last week?  Or perhaps there is some other
reminder scheme commonly used?

It would be too bad if the forum scheme resulted in a lot of
posting-into-the-void.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200404121353.AA5358375pd80000085881@gard.com>

Has anyone actually done a comparison to see what sort of effect modeling the frame different ways has on the actual loads in the space.  I realize there is no panacea answer but I would be curious to know what the effect of modeling a single window with enlarged frame area vs actual window size and frame width is.  Is it a 5% difference or a 20% or .05%.  I am curious only because I have always assumed the difference was small and that there were more important (larger impact) modeling items to worry about.  
 
Please note that I am not trying to discount the importance of correctly modeling windows but trying to understand the overall impact different modeling techniques might have on output.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Curtain wall frames and fenestration area


Also, if you are using either of the detailed glazing models, the way Steve describes should better account for edge-of-glass effects. Dividing glazing up into lots of tiny little "panes," as some architects want, has an extemely delterious effect on the IGU overall U-factor, above and beyond the effect of the frame itself. If using the SC inputs, it might be instructive to run Window 5 on some similar configurations, to check the overall U-value with DOE2's output. (Noting where interior, exterior etc films are/aren't accounted for.)

If you want a pretty rendering for the client, I recommend a separate model, for presentation only. And then if trying to do daylighting calcs......;

	The solution below can work, but does not take into account the effect of shading due to fins and overhangs.  For those windows, a better approach is to define one of the windows, together with its fins/overhang, and then use the window MULTIPLIER to establish the total number of windows on the wall wall.  If the overhang shades a significant portion of the wall, in addition to the window, then the overhang can be defined as a separate shading surface.

		Renee,
		 
		The easiest way to do this is to use a single window on each wall.  Calculate the percentage of window area that is actually frame and then adjust the frame-width to account for the increase.  You may end up with a window frame width that is 12 inches or bigger  (if the wall is large enough).  With a little ingenuity you can write some BDL code that will automatically calculate the window width, frame width and x position of the window on the wall so you don't get any cautions or warnings.  .

		Greetings,
		
		I am modeling a high-rise building in eQuest which has a significant amount of fenestration as curtain wall. This curtain wall, like many curtain walls, has metal frames around many small panes of glass that make up the total curtain wall. My question is, how do you treat the frames and the fenestration area?  If I model each small pane of glass and add the exact frame, this would probably overwhelm DOE2 due to the huge number of small windows.  If I model the glass as one big window, then is it correct to just add the total width of the frame to each of these large windows? Also, some of these curtain wall panes have fins to complicate things, so if I do one big glass pane, then adding the fins would make huge fins on either side of the glass. If you have dealt with modeling curtain walls, as probably many of you have, please let me know how you have dealt with these issues.

I agree with chip - the value of having something pop up in your email
is huge. I probably wouldn't bother to visit the forum site as much.
Also, a lot of times people send attachments by email in response to
questions. This might not be viable for a forum site. I still think
there are benefits to the forum though - the most important being the
archive of threads. Jason - do you have the infrastructure to build an
archive?

Alec et al --

I agree with all of your points.

However, one of the values of the eMail format is that activity
announces itself.  When a message appears, I take a moment to read it.
If I have something to add, I answer.

I imagine that I would rarely go read a forum unless I had a specific
question or issue.

Can forums be set up so they send an occasional eMail noting that 42 new
postings have appeared in the last week?  Or perhaps there is some other
reminder scheme commonly used?

It would be too bad if the forum scheme resulted in a lot of
posting-into-the-void.

There are several forums that I participate in from time to time that
are web based.  
Advantages are many:  Threads are categorized by topic, and old threads
readily archived.  Sample topics could include things like DOE2
simulation questions, weather questions, Energy Plus questions, job
postings, conferences, calls for papers, etc.  You can also decide what
you you are interested in and what you want to read about, rather than
having to sort out an inbox-full of posts about something that doesn't
tickle your fancy. 
 
Not sure what the budget is for maintaining the bldg-sim list, but I
think the usefulness quotient would go up a notch if it were a web
forum.
 
Example web forums:

What is the general sentiment out there? 
(if this were a web-based forum, we could initiate a user poll to find
out the answer!)
 
p.s.: I am not trying to start a ruckus here, I definitely enjoy the
list and have found it very useful over the years.

[BLDG-SIM] Curtain wall frames and fenestration areaThe solution below can work, but does not take into account the effect of shading due to fins and overhangs.  For those windows, a better approach is to define one of the windows, together with its fins/overhang, and then use the window MULTIPLIER to establish the total number of windows on the wall wall.  If the overhang shades a significant portion of the wall, in addition to the window, then the overhang can be defined as a separate shading surface.

  Renee,

  The easiest way to do this is to use a single window on each wall.  Calculate the percentage of window area that is actually frame and then adjust the frame-width to account for the increase.  You may end up with a window frame width that is 12 inches or bigger  (if the wall is large enough).  With a little ingenuity you can write some BDL code that will automatically calculate the window width, frame width and x position of the window on the wall so you don't get any cautions or warnings.  .

  Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Curtain wall frames and fenestration area


  Greetings,

  I am modeling a high-rise building in eQuest which has a significant amount of fenestration as curtain wall. This curtain wall, like many curtain walls, has metal frames around many small panes of glass that make up the total curtain wall. My question is, how do you treat the frames and the fenestration area?  If I model each small pane of glass and add the exact frame, this would probably overwhelm DOE2 due to the huge number of small windows.  If I model the glass as one big window, then is it correct to just add the total width of the frame to each of these large windows? Also, some of these curtain wall panes have fins to complicate things, so if I do one big glass pane, then adding the fins would make huge fins on either side of the glass. If you have dealt with modeling curtain walls, as probably many of you have, please let me know how you have dealt with these issues.

  Thank you,

  Renee

In your research with radiant heating cooling savings, have you found any 
energy "savings" that can be attributed directly to the use of the radiant 
system vs other systems (air supply in particular).  For example, I have 
seen some papers that note that the heating setpoint can be relaxed while 
still maintaining thermal comfort with a radiant system.
