That is interesting.  The LEED Gold project I simulated required some 
modifications (from the LEED reviewer) that could not be done with HAP, 
etc.  Only a 3D capable program could do what I was required to do using 
DOE2.1e.  I could have done the same with DOE2.2.

I stand corrected on ASHRAE 90.1 - From Section 11.2.1: "(a program such 
as, but not limited to, DOE-2 or BLAST)".

I am glad to find such an informed email list.

Eric is absolutely correct! DOE2 is not required nor is it the only available software that meets data submission requirements. ASHRAE and the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) do not officially sanction or certify software programs. As for LEEDS, the USGBC only determines the acceptability of data for LEED project submissions. Other commercially available software programs such as Carrier Corporation's HAP meet all data acceptability requirements of LEEDS and the ECB method from ASHRAE 90.1-2001.

  I am not a definitive authority, but I do not believe that ASHRAE 90.1 or LEED requires DOE-2.1e exclusively.  Section 11.2.1 of 90.1-1999 & 2001 requires "a program such as, but not limited to, DOE-2 or BLAST."  It then outlines required capabilities of the simulation program.  eQUEST is DOE-2 based, so I believe that it is acceptable for 90.1 compliance and LEED scoring.

  We use DOE2.1e in our shop.  Primarily because of the significant verification against measured data that has been done on DOE2.1e over the years.  The other reason is that ASHRAE 90.1 and in particular LEED require simulation using DOE2.1e.  

  Here in Canada, the Model National Energy Code, Performance Option required simulation using EE4 (a free compliance tool http://www.ee4.com ) that used the DOE2.1e engine from Hirsh and Associates.  Similar to eQuest, you can use EE4 to quickly generate an input file then edit it for you particular situation.






    We use eQuest extensively, sometimes using the wizard mode to get started, sometimes not. We began using DOE2.1d when it was first available on PC platforms and kept with it through PowerDOE and the `never officially released DOE2.2. We often use eQuest to create BDL code which we then edit with a text editor.  I must admit I m sometimes surprised to hear of modelers (often in Academic situations) still working with 2.1e when `2.2 is a significant improvement and is absolutely free via eQuest. 

    I, like John, am holding off on EnergyPlus until I can justify the tremendous expense of training my people on a new product that is still not ready for prime time. Eventually, I hope, but not yet. I m guessing five years before there is a product that is enough better than eQuest to justify the investment. (And that s assuming eQuest doesn t continue to improve). 

    I imagine that there are numerous eQuest users that are not aware of the BLDG-SIM forum. Too bad it would be nice to see more interaction around the eQuest program.  Perhaps SCE/EDR could provide an information blurb about this forum on their web site or to everyone who down loads eQuest.

    John,

     

    There are at least a few of us out here using eQUEST/DOE-2.2 on a regular basis.  I started using DOE-2.1 back when it was Cal-ERDA 1.3 (about 1979) and have followed the Hirsch upgrades through PowerDOE and eQUEST.  I have only seen a Beta version of eQUEST 3.0, but it looks very interesting.

     

    My specialty is energy simulation and I use eQUEST and the "Detailed Data Edit" Mode on almost all of our energy simulation jobs.  JJ Hirsch and Associates are looking for ways to offer more support, but probably at a price.  I can offer some support, free if it is trivial (to me) or at my regular rates if it is more involved.  Our web site is http://www.roberts-engineering.com/.  Hopefully, you will find some useful information there.

     

    I think the User Group is a good idea, though you already have a discussion forum through BLDG-SIM at gard.com.  Let me know how much interest you get.

requires "a program such as, but not limited to, DOE-2 or BLAST."  It then
outlines required capabilities of the simulation program.  eQUEST is DOE-2
based, so I believe that it is acceptable for 90.1 compliance and LEED
scoring.

We use DOE2.1e in our shop.  Primarily because of the significant
verification against measured data that has been done on DOE2.1e over the
years.  The other reason is that ASHRAE 90.1 and in particular LEED require
simulation using DOE2.1e.

Here in Canada, the Model National Energy Code, Performance Option required
simulation using EE4 (a free compliance tool http://www.ee4.com ) that used
the DOE2.1e engine from Hirsh and Associates.  Similar to eQuest, you can
use EE4 to quickly generate an input file then edit it for you particular
situation.






  We use eQuest extensively, sometimes using the wizard mode to get started,
sometimes not. We began using DOE2.1d when it was first available on PC
platforms and kept with it through PowerDOE and the `never officially
released DOE2.2. We often use eQuest to create BDL code which we then edit
with a text editor.  I must admit I m sometimes surprised to hear of
modelers (often in Academic situations) still working with 2.1e when `2.2 is
a significant improvement and is absolutely free via eQuest.

  I, like John, am holding off on EnergyPlus until I can justify the
tremendous expense of training my people on a new product that is still not
ready for prime time. Eventually, I hope, but not yet. I m guessing five
years before there is a product that is enough better than eQuest to justify
the investment. (And that s assuming eQuest doesn t continue to improve).

  I imagine that there are numerous eQuest users that are not aware of the
BLDG-SIM forum. Too bad it would be nice to see more interaction around the
eQuest program.  Perhaps SCE/EDR could provide an information blurb about
this forum on their web site or to everyone who down loads eQuest.

  John,



  There are at least a few of us out here using eQUEST/DOE-2.2 on a regular
basis.  I started using DOE-2.1 back when it was Cal-ERDA 1.3 (about 1979)
and have followed the Hirsch upgrades through PowerDOE and eQUEST.  I have
only seen a Beta version of eQUEST 3.0, but it looks very interesting.



  My specialty is energy simulation and I use eQUEST and the "Detailed Data
Edit" Mode on almost all of our energy simulation jobs.  JJ Hirsch and
Associates are looking for ways to offer more support, but probably at a
price.  I can offer some support, free if it is trivial (to me) or at my
regular rates if it is more involved.  Our web site is
http://www.roberts-engineering.com/.  Hopefully, you will find some useful
information there.



  I think the User Group is a good idea, though you already have a
discussion forum through BLDG-SIM at gard.com.  Let me know how much interest
you get.

    May I ask how many people are attempting to use eQuest/DOE-2.2? I would
like to form a User Group for exchanging questions and war stories, as the
creators of the program do not apparently have funding for very much support

    I have taken Marlin Addison's a few times, with the last version I have

    There claims to be over 7,000 downloads of the program. Anyone getting

Is there anybody who can indicate me how to change the
functions in DOEPlus? I am trying to define my own double-glass facade which I 
can't find a proper description
in the default DOEPlus.

Double-glass facade is actually double paned curtain walls
with with air cavity in between. Usually, there is Venetian
blind installed in the air cavity for the shading purpose in
summer.

Double-glass facade can either be naturally ventilated or
connected with the HVAC's return air duct.

In terms of construction typology, it can either be stick
system like the Occidantal Building near Niagara Falls, or
unit system like the Commerz Bank in Germany.

Because its complexity, I would like to define it in DOEPlus
according to the data I collected in the lab.

Thanks a lot in advance!(Also thanks Jason's responding.)

I don't have any more data then the max, min and annual 
average inlet water temperature so I don't know the lag 
effects.  One to three months seems reasonable and matches 
my intuition.

Sounds reasonable but I don't have any knowledge of the

I wonder of those places purposely bury their water pipes 
as deep as possible to take advantage of the "free water

Given the variation in water supply systems, I think many  
details would be needed to reach R2 of 0.90 but it is 
certainly possible. Unfortunately, I don't have the 
resources to do a survey of water supply systems.

Jason,

I have three thoughts on this :

1) time delay in water temperatures compared to air temperatures. Have you
tried comparing the inlet water temperatures to monthly average temperatures
or degree-days from previous months ?   Assuming that the water pipes are
underground, their temperatures might be closer to soil temperatures 1 meter
or 2 meters down.  For those soil temperatures, the time lag from air
temperatures would be 1 month or 3 months, based on some foundation analysis
work I've done recently.

2) distance from where the water comes from. If the source is far away, the
inlet water temperature will be a composite of the air (or soil)
temperatures at the source and site. For example, water in San Francisco
comes from the Sierras, so I would assume the water temperature would be
significantly colder than San Francisco air or soil temperatures.  In your
regressions, you might take those cities out or add in a second term for the
air or soil temperatures at the water source.

3) there are a few places where the ground temperatures are significantly
higher than air temperature due to geothermal sources. I don't know if any
of the cities in the handbook falls in this category.

I would guess you should be able to get R2 much better than 0.4-0.6, more
like 0.90 or so.  This is just purely a guess on my part.

Joe

I received many suggestions for data sources for cold water 
inlet temperatures but the best was:

  EPRI TR-100212, December 1992, "Commercial Water Heating
  Applications Handbook" by D.W. Abrams & Assoc.

I did some analysis of that data with NCDC degree day and 
average temperature data.  Generally, the conclusion I came 
to is that average monthly and annual temperatures are no 
better at predicting inlet temperature then heating degree 
day data.  That is the not what I expected. The R2 
(goodness of fit) that I was getting are in the 0.4 - 0.6 
range, not very good but expected.  Here are the equations 
I'm planning on using:

  maximum inlet temp = -0.002860 * HDD + 87.8

  average inlet temp = -0.003161 * HDD + 74.3

  minimum inlet temp = -0.003135 * HDD + 59.3  

Where HDD is the annual heating degree days base 65.

As you can see the slopes are about the same but the y-
intercepts are different.  For those who want to explore 
the number some more, my spreadsheet is attached.

Thanks to all who gave me references!

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] ventilation airchange function
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200302260924.AA2448187pd80000262799@gard.com>

WHAT
I am searching for a function which correlates the (natural) ventilation
air change rate due to the (wanted) opening of windows with the indoor
air temperature, outdoor air temperature and possibly with other
quantities (e.g. time of the day, etc.). The function could be used to
model the user behaviour. It would be best suited, if the function was
valid for the winter case, houses without a mechanical ventilation
system and homes, not office buildings, and if it described a statistic,
average behaviour, rather than a single case (people behave very
differently; the function is wanted for a case study, not for the
simulation of one particular house.) 

MORE DETAIL OF WHAT
If a house reasonably airtight but not fitted with a mechanical 
ventilation system, the inhabitants will open windows to achieve a
reasonable air change. Let us assume a winter situation, with the
outdoor temperatures being clearly below the indoor air temperature. The
windows will be opened frequently if the room temperature is fairly
high, as is often the case with homes having massive passive solar
gains. Windows will be opened (or be left open) less frequently if it is
already uncomfortably cold inside. The air change rate is certainly a
function of the room temperature. It seems to be reasonable to assume
that the air change rate is also, and to a great extent, dependent on
the outdoor temperature.  

WHY
Active solar heating systems tend to use the thermal mass of the house
as extra storage capacity. In times of solar gain (or when the
additional water tank is nearly fully charged), these systems supply
extra heat to the building which causes higher room tempartures. In
order to study the effect of such systems it is indispensable to take
the extra ventilation losses due to the higher room temperature into
account.  


I am aware that it must be very difficult to establish such a function.
However, because it is a common problem in building simulation, I
suppose a number of people were already confronted with the problem,
and I dare asking you all. Any help is appreciated.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200302250819.AA1946531pd80000262183@gard.com>

To follow up on notes from Erik Olsen and Harvey Bryan, the International 
Building Performance Simulation Association (IBPSA) is interested in just 
the sort of issues about modeling, energy analysis and performance 
assessment that have been raised recently in bldg-sim.  IBPSA sponsors 
biennial international conferences, the next of which will be in Eindhoven, 
Netherlands, August 11-14, 2003.  Information about this and other IBPSA 
activities can be found at www.ibpsa.org.

The USA affiliate of IBPSA holds semi-annual meetings, on the Saturday 
preceding the national ASHRAE conferences.  The next meeting, listed in the 
IBPSA web site, will be in Kansas City on June 28, 2002.  Those interested 
in details or in becoming IBPSA-USA members (for which there is no charge 
in 2003) should contact the Rick Strand, the IBPSA-USA secretary, at 
rkstrand at uiuc.edu.

IBPSA-USA is currently in the early stages of developing PowerPoint 
presentation materials about the use of simulation in engineering and 
architectural practice.  We hope that these materials, which should be 
ready in late spring, will be used at local AIA and ASHRAE meetings and at 
other venues, will be a means of promoting increased discussion about and 
understanding of the benefits (and difficulties) of using 
simulation.  Groups that are interested in seeing this sort of presentation 
are invited to contact Rick Strand or me.

Further, we are beginning to think about regional and a national meeting on 
the use of simulation.  Very tentatively, we are considering regional 
meetings in Boston and Chicago this fall and a national meeting in Boulder 
next summer.  The regional meetings would be roughly half-day events, 
hosted by local engineering or design firms, to give practitioners 
opportunity to talk about successes and problems.  The national meeting 
would include presentations, discussions, and software demos.  We invite 
expressions of interest in these or similar events.

None of what I've mentioned is intended in any way to detract from the 
wonderful bldg-sim discussion.  IBPSA is simply one organization with 
similar interests and a willingness to provide venues for sharing ideas.

Mark,

I would be very interested in participating in such a seminar/symposium.
I've been teaching building energy simulation for over 20 years, mostly to
architectural students. Up until recently it was a very painful experience
(BDL is not a very friendly environment for instruction), however with the
introduction of eQUEST and other friendly interfaces building simulation has
turned into a very exciting class. I have shared some of these experiences
in a paper I wrote for the 2000 ASES conference (I will try finding it in
electronic form and send it off to you). Also IBPSA at it's Chicago meeting
in January approved a contract to develop a series of building simulation
tutorials for educators (I will find out who got the contract and when the
project will be completed).

I've found this discussion of 3D Modeling + Energy Analysis, or getting
the whole design team into the performance assessment game, most
fascinating. I would like to propose a seminar, or series of seminars
and symposiums (documented case studies) on the topic, or various topics
presented in the preceding chain.
I know this isn't necessarily original but to see it discussed on this
particular forum adds, I think, a new dimension. I'm pleasantly
surprised at the number of responses from architects who, by their
presence on BLDG-SIM@ Gard.com obviously pay attention to modeling and
building simulation. 
They could start within a group such as ASHRAE, but would need to branch
out to AIA and other associations. Ideally, we could produce something
to present at local venues, to the local design, owner, operator
community. 
There is time to probably get a seminar at the ASHRAE Winter meeting in
Anaheim, Jan 04. I can think of at least two ASHRAE Technical Committees
that would be interested. 
Anyone interested? Other venues?

I may point out that we have started some work at IIT Bombay in
association with architects for combining building design and
simulation. The architect does not have to know the details of a
simulation. We have integrated the design and simulation process. The
first part of the project has been completed. It is called TADSIM:Tools
for Architectural Design and SIMluation. A part of the result was
presented in SOLAR 2002 (Reno, Nevada, USA) in June 2002.

I cannot stand mute on this discussion anymore. I will speak for myself and
not as a representative of IBPSA but there is some work in this direction
already. IBPSA-USA has expressed a strong interested in planning
regional/local meetings intended for architects and engineers discussing
what building performance simulation is (including but not limited to energy
simulation), how it can be used in design, how it can improve designs, case
studies, etc. Ideas for partnership organizations have included AIA and
USGBC. It is just an idea right now but if more people get involved, the
likelihood of real action will increase.

In addition, an agreement has nearly been reached for preparation of
presentations on building performance simulation for audiences of architects
and engineers. The intent is for these presentations to be used for varied
audiences at professional meetings and other venues as has been discussed
today, and it is my impression that they will be nearly public domain
material, intended for the common good of the profession. This is a real
project that you can expect to see a product from in a few months.

So, keep your eyes open for progress on these initiatives. Again, I am
speaking for myself and OWP/P, not IBPSA, but want to raise awareness of
what is happening - it would be better to work together rather than starting
many isolated actions.

ASHRAE TC 1.5, Computer Applications can host this.  Mark, if there is
enough interest, please let me know and we can include it in the Kansas
City program agenda.

However, I must point out this dialog needs to originate and occur where
architects and engineers meet together.  ASHRAE meetings tend to be
highly HVAC engineers/designers oriented and if we can get a few
architects to present their views at this meeting, that would be great.


Other possible avenues - The Thermal Envelopes conference, the AIA
annual convention or the Solar society meetings.

Another good venue for this discussion/seminar would be the US Green 
Building Council Conference - GreenBuild in Pittsburgh this November.  Will 
be a great mix of the players - architects, engineers, contractors, owners, 
etc.  If anyone is interested I can put you in touch with the organizers.

I've found this discussion of 3D Modeling + Energy Analysis, or getting
the whole design team into the performance assessment game, most
fascinating. I would like to propose a seminar, or series of seminars
and symposiums (documented case studies) on the topic, or various topics
presented in the preceding chain. I know this isn't necessarily original
but to see it discussed on this particular forum adds, I think, a new
dimension. I'm pleasantly surprised at the number of responses from
architects who, by their presence on BLDG-SIM@ Gard.com obviously pay
attention to modeling and building simulation. 
They could start within a group such as ASHRAE, but would need to branch
out to AIA and other associations. Ideally, we could produce something
to present at local venues, to the local design, owner, operator
community. 
There is time to probably get a seminar at the ASHRAE Winter meeting in
Anaheim, Jan 04. I can think of at least two ASHRAE Technical Committees
that would be interested. 
Anyone interested? Other venues?

I may point out that we have started some work at IIT Bombay in
association with architects for combining building design and
simulation. The architect does not have to know the details of a
simulation. We have integrated the design and simulation process. The
first part of the project has been completed. It is called TADSIM:Tools
for Architectural Design and SIMluation. A part of the result was
presented in SOLAR 2002 (Reno, Nevada, USA) in June 2002.

Hello all

The discussion which was initiated a long time ago, has gained momentum
and we have responses from a wide variety of backgrounds and
geographical locations. I would like to take the opportunity to
summarise.

PRACTISING ARCHITECTS:
========================================================================
==
a. Data input and output: Most software requires data to be prepared in
their own legacy format, which is the main barrier in integrating the
software into the design process. They argued on the need of software
which can take data from existing CAD software and archive the result
for future use.

COMMENTS: In my own view, IFC (from IAI) is in the process of
development and we can hope to see software able to be integrated with a
single design repository before the first quarter of 2004. For more
information see related BS-8 documents and webpages.

b. Integrated and intuitive tools for whole-building simulation: There
has been a paradigm shift in the way simulation software is designed.
EnergyPlus incorporated BLAST & DOE and can connect to other engines
like COMIS; BDA offers links to ASCII based simulation software. Members
of this group suggested tools like Ener-Win, Energy10, HEED, and
ECOTECT. The change is evident and developers are actually working on
that.
========================================================================
==

HVAC PROFESSIONALS:
========================================================================
==
a. HVAC and software designers think that the current generation of
simulation software are adequate for the purpose of energy efficient
design (Architects have reservations about it - they initiate designs
and most of the decisions are taken before passing on to HVAC
professionals. They need more intuitive and simplified tool to get a
feeling about the energy efficiency of building). 

b. HVAC designers are not too worried about the existing input and
output methods. They are happy because some tools are there to help
them: eQuest, Visual DOE and such which is a significant improvement
over generic TEXT based input.

c. **IMP**: HVAC designers insisted on to be integrated in the design
team from early stages which is not realistic for small to medium size
projects.
========================================================================
==

I would like to extend Mr. Mark Case's view for a meeting/ seminar or
workshop among building design professionals for detailed discussion on
this topic. Can we have a teleconference/ web based video conference so
that geographically dispersed people can participate?

Professionals from different background may have varied opinions which
are healthy for overall development of the industry. Probably everybody
needs to sit together and sort out a framework for future development.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] getting the whole design team ...,  3D Modeling + Energy Analysis
In-Reply-To: <MDAEMON-F200302232224.AA2427859pd80000362868@gard.com>
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200302240919.AA194193pd80000261583@gard.com>

I've found this discussion of 3D Modeling + Energy Analysis, or getting
the whole design team into the performance assessment game, most
fascinating. I would like to propose a seminar, or series of seminars
and symposiums (documented case studies) on the topic, or various topics
presented in the preceding chain.
I know this isn't necessarily original but to see it discussed on this
particular forum adds, I think, a new dimension. I'm pleasantly
surprised at the number of responses from architects who, by their
presence on BLDG-SIM@ Gard.com obviously pay attention to modeling and
building simulation. 
They could start within a group such as ASHRAE, but would need to branch
out to AIA and other associations. Ideally, we could produce something
to present at local venues, to the local design, owner, operator
community. 
There is time to probably get a seminar at the ASHRAE Winter meeting in
Anaheim, Jan 04. I can think of at least two ASHRAE Technical Committees
that would be interested. 
Anyone interested? Other venues?

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] 3D Modeling + Energy Analysis

I may point out that we have started some work at IIT Bombay in
association with architects for combining building design and
simulation. The architect does not have to know the details of a
simulation. We have integrated the design and simulation process. The
first part of the project has been completed. It is called TADSIM:Tools
for Architectural Design and SIMluation. A part of the result was
presented in SOLAR 2002 (Reno, Nevada, USA) in June 2002.

Thanks.

Hi Maria-

One of the jobs I worked on this week had electric humidifiers.  The pump
energy seemed very high.  When we did a 2nd simulation with the only change
being gas hydronic humidifiers, the pump energy dropped drastically.  No
other usage category changed.  So it seems humidifier energy is included in
the Pump & Aux category.  I'm not sure what other energy usage is included.

Hope this helps.  Have a nice day.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200302181707.AA075015pd80000258916@gard.com>

Hello All,

I have been reading the thread of discussion regarding architects and building 
simulation, over the past week and am very interested in the issues brought 
forward. Following on that track I would like to request the members of this 
bldg-sim mailing list to please take a moment and answer the simple survey as 
per your experience. In working towards my PhD research, I would like to find 
out the most typical and frequent questions that architects ask regarding the 
performance of their building when in the design stage. Please fill out the 
section relevant to your profession and email your responses to me at: 
smita at cmu.edu

You may include any number of questions that come to your mind.

Thank you for your time and effort.

Regards,

Imagine that you are designing a building (you can think of your most recent 
projects) which has to take into account environmental performance criteria 
(such as energy use, daylighting, mechanical systems, acoustic etc.). 

If you had the opportunity to ask an expert in this field about improving your 
design, what would be the typical example of questions you would ask? (please 
be specific in your examples)

The default boiler part-load performance curve is based on the ICES reports (Integrated Community Energy Systems) prepared by Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the 1970's.  This single curve is almost certainly not representative of all boilers.  In fact I would expect that the part-load performance of atmospheric boilers might be significantly different than from forced-draft boilers, where the percentage of excess air at part-load firing can be better controlled. 

The default MIN-RATIO is 0.25 for all fuel-fired boilers.  For versions 2.1e and earlier, Fred is correct in stating that the program holds the efficiency constant at part-load ratios below this value.  Version 2.2/eQUEST/PowerDOE address this issue by applying part of the START-UP-TIME to the portion of the hour the boiler is cycling.

If you have part-load data that includes the effect of cycling, then the best approach is to create a curve including the cycling portion of the range (use the CURVE-FIT command to generate the coefficients), and set the MIN-RATIO to zero or a very small fraction.  

Using a curve-generating routine other than the 2.2's CURVE-FIT algorithm may not give the correct results; DOE-2 expects that the part-load curve to give a value of exactly 1.0 at a part-load ratio of 1.0, and the CURVE-FIT algorithm ensures this (see the documentation for more information).  If you generate the curve using a different program, such as Excel, the best fit often does not yield the value of 1.0 at PLR = 1.0  There is a version of the program in development that can use any best-fit curve; this release will be available later this year.

The fuel-fired boilers do not have default curves correcting performance for supply and ambient ambient temperature (CAPACITY-FT, HIR-FT),  so the AQUASTAT-T setpoint should have no effect unless you also define the curves; these hooks were added in case someone had data and wanted to model this effect.

DOE-2.2 allows you to create libraries of boilers, chillers, VAV systems, etc.; similar to the material, construction, and window libraries of 2.1e (store the components in USRLIB.DAT).  If you have performance data for components that you would like to share, why not post them to this site so that others can include them in their libraries?

  Additionally:
  First, in DOE2.x, if I'm not mistaken, the BOILER "MIN-RATIO," or cycling threshold, holds the efficiency (PLR modified EIR) constant below the specified PLR, contrary to reality and intuition. I think this input defaults to a PLR of 20%, just a bit above where boiler efficiency starts to really go down the tubes. So this needs to be dropped to a very low value(where your EIR-fPLR curve goes wacko) if you roll your own curves.

  Aquastat temp (under BOILER), and HW reset scheds(HW-LOOP) can also have  major effects. Actually you need to create another custom curve(HIR-FT), and reduce the aquastat minimum, if you want the HW temp to interact with the boiler, which it most certainly does. See the DOE2.2 BOILER docs.

  Also, if you set up your model with optimistic assumptions (most defaults), you may miss many hours at very low (<5%) heating loads.

  In any case, most modulating boilers go down to 20 or 25%, and so may not show great savings compared to a 33% low fire.

  A method of calculating part load efficiency for boilers is outlined in the spreadsheets that can be downloaded from:
  http://www.keh-ee.com/cycling.htm

  These require some modification and care in use for purpose of developing DOE2 curves. Steady-state efficiency may vary somewhat with load, producing the manufacturer's cited increase in efficiency at 50% load. This cited efficiency improvment may also take into account some assumed HW reset, much as ARI NPLV chiller points include condenser "relief," at the lower loads.

  GOOD LUCK! In consideration of the other thread: Even with 3D IFC/DXF interfaces, architects (are any still reading) should not attempt this.

    Hello All,

    As part of a comprehensive energy study for a new elementary school, we are analyzing fuel savings opportunities for a proposed boiler with fully modulating burners as compared to a base-case sectional lo-hi-lo boiler.  So far, we have found that, all things being equal, there are no significant savings associated with such a measure (at least not for the boiler size and models we've been considering).

    We use PowerDOE for most of our energy simulations.  In the course of this study, we have come to question the default boiler part-load heat-input-ratio curve ( HW-Blr-HIR-fPLR) found in Bdllib.dat.  Until now, we have applied this curve to most base-case boiler calculations (perhaps mistakenly?).  Does anyone know of the origins of this curve or what it would have been based upon?  Most manufacturers we have spoken with state that peak boiler efficiency occurs between 25% and 50% load.  Using the default curve, peak performance occurs at full load and efficiency decreases by nearly 10% at half load.

    Also, if this curve is in error, can anyone suggest a method for developing a more reasonable curve estimate?

    Thanks,
    Wade

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200302141132.AA3254640pd80000257213@gard.com>

I absolutely agree with what David Bryan said about architects being the
initiator of energy-conscious design.  As a firm, we choose our
consulting engineers based partly on their experience with, and
attitudes toward, sustainable design and LEED.    Unfortunately, there
are a multitude of other considerations that must be accounted for early
on in the design process.  We try to get the owner on board early, since
without his cooperation, we would just end up with the same old building
built the same old way.

About a year ago our firm began looking into building simulation tools
and settled on eQUEST.  It has a simple enough user interface through
the wizards that no extensive training was required.  We cannot afford
an in-house energy simulation specialist.  But this also means that we
cannot  conduct the detailed and highly accurate simulations that could
be done by a professional simulator.  We use it as a quick analysis tool
to evaluate the energy savings of different design strategies to help us
tell the owner if the payback is worth the initial expense.  We do
initial architectural design strategy studies and leave the Title 24 and
energy calculations to the engineers.

Until simulation tools become intuitive enough that architects can use
them without extensive training, I don't foresee them becoming
widespread for any but the most complex of buildings.  But even more
than that, I want to see a simulation tool that will allow me to take a
drawing and import it straight from AutoCAD - no tracing, no redrawing,
just using the drawings that I already have.  These days, building
designs are input into the computer very early in the design phase and
building simulation programs need to recognize that if they are ever to
be used by more than a handful of professionals.  What is out there
right now does not recognize the way architects work, but just adds one
more thing I have to learn to my workload.

As for the comment that schools need to teach the technical aspects of
building more, I agree.  My old university has gone from offering a few
electives when I was there to multiple classes and studios that focus on
sustainable design, professional practice, and yes, even energy
simulation tools.  The change is happening, but it might take a few
years for the current crop of students to get into a position in the
workforce where they can influence production.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200302141034.AA3404828pd80000257163@gard.com>

To add some more comments to the discussion of the architect's role in the 
energy simulation process:

1. It seems to me that the architect must be the initiator 
of  energy-conscious design.  He/she has the contact with the building 
owner and is instrumental in determining what the priorities will be in 
allocating the money available for the project.  Energy conservation must 
be set at a very high priority at the start; there is never enough money to 
do everything.

2. In commercial buildings, the design is a product of the whole team of 
architects, engineers, speciality consultants and contractors.  The team of 
people with the right skills and experience must be assembled at the start 
to meet project design priories.  The architect does not need to do the 
simulations.  Smaller firms would probably not find it practical to have on 
staff an energy specialist who can maintain current knowledge of the 
field.  What is probably more important is good team communications and 
early involvement of the energy specialist(s) before many design decisions 
are made.  What is important is that the team members are all using 
compatible software.  Decisions effecting the building are continuously 
being made; digital information is flying around via shared web-sites or by 
e-mail.  The interaction between energy-conservative alternatives and 
building organization, exterior appearance, spacial quality, 
heating/cooling, lighting, acoustics, structure and construction cost are, 
as you know,  very complex. Each team member must be able to rapidly 
respond in his own area of expertise.  For better or worse, Autocad is the 
de facto standard.  To keep costs down, and accuracy, speed and efficiency 
up, energy simulation programs will need to import files that are initially 
created in Autocad.

3.  Although the architecture firm does not need to do in-house energy 
consumption simulations, the architectural project leader must be 
interested and knowledgeable in energy conservation.  He must have the 
enthusiasm to sustain a high level of energy-conscious priorities, and must 
be able to communicate well with the energy specialists and direct their 
efforts toward successful solutions.  This issue goes back to education.  I 
think architects fall into two broad categories: designers and organizers. 
Or to put it another way, if architecture is a combination of art and 
engineering, some people's skills are more on the art side, some on the 
engineering side, (bow ties versus pocket-protectors) Both categories are 
needed to create successful buildings.  From my experience, architectural 
education is currently pretty one-sided: it favors the bow ties at the 
expense of the pocket-protectors.  This situation is not good for the 
architecture profession; students who have worked 6 years to get a masters 
only have half the skills they need, have an unrealistic view of what type 
of work they will be doing and still require a lot of on-the job 
training.   This situation is unnecessary. I participated in a 
graduate-level program at MIT in the 1970's that focused on energy 
conservation, building simulation and materials research.  More educational 
focus on the technical aspects of making buildings is needed.

I apologize for writing so much.  Thanks for letting me get it off my chest.

I haven't used Doe 2.2, just Doe2.1e, but I suspect
the problems with the boiler are the same. There's a
bit of a glitch in the boiler model when it comes to
part load, as Doe2 considers the boiler capable of
cycling "OFF". When it does, no energy is consumed. Of
course in reality boilers aren't OFF unless somebody
shuts them down for summer. When they're not firing
they still have jacket and stack losses, which have to
be accounted for when the boiler fires again. But in
Doe2, a boiler with a higher part load ratio will
cycle "OFF" more often, reducing consumption. So a
boiler with a low part load ratio will be less
efficient than one with a high PLR, the opposite of
what it should be. I get around this by specifying
boilers with a minimum PLR of 0.001 and then
incorporating all the losses and the cycling action
into the boiler curve.

As an HVAC design engineer I was a member of the A&E design team for a 
high-rise speculative office building.  The design process was totally 
interactive, and it cost a lot compared to the standard practice.  On the 
other hand, it resulted in a building that was pleasing in every aspect and 
saved enough on energy to pay back the extra design costs very 
quickly.  Although the building was very energy efficient, the construction 
costs were not noticeably higher than those of typical design practice.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] WORKING AS A TEAM/ WHAT ARCHITECT SHOULD NOW
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200302130902.AA0233671pd80000256474@gard.com>

Hello;
To add to the current discussion. here is a case study; the "Architect" Leonardo Da Vinici telling his qualifications in Art and arhcitecture.

Letter by Da Vinci To Ludovico Sforza

1-I have a process for the construction of very light bridges, capable of easy transport, by means of which the enemy may be pursued and put to flight and of others more solid, which will resist both and sword, and which are easily lowered or raised I know also of a means to burn and destroy hostile bridges.
2.In case of the investment of a place, I know how to drain moats and construct scaling ladders and such apparatus.
3.Item ; if, by reason of its elevation or strength it is not possible to bombard a hostile position, I have a means of destruction by mining provided foundations of the fortress are not of rock.
4.I know also how to make light cannon easy be transport capable of ejecting inflammable the smoke from which would cause terror, destruction, and confusion among the enemy. [Note here a fifteenth?century forecast of smoke-screens and, poison gas.?
5.Item; by means of narrow and tortuous subterranean tunnels, dug without noise, I am able create a passage to inaccessible places, even under rivers.
6.Item; I know how to construct secured and covered wagons for the transport of guns into enemy?s lines, and not to be impeded by ever dense a mass, and behind which the infantry c follow without danger. [A possible vision of modern tank.
7.I can make cannon, mortars, and engines . etc., of form both useful and beautiful, and different from those at present in use.
8.Or if the use of cannon happens to be impracticable, I can replace them by catapults and other admirable projecting weapons at present unknown; in short, where such is the case, I am able to devise endless means of attack.
9.And, if the combat should be at sea, I have numerous most powerful engines both for attack and defense ; and ships which are both gun-proof and fire-proof; and also powders and inflammables.
10.In times of peace, I believe that I can compete with anyone in architecture, and in the construction of both public and private monuments, and in the building of canals. I am able to execute statues in marble, bronze, and clay; in painting I can do as well as anyone else. In particular, 1 will under?take to execute the bronze horse in the eternal memory of your father and of the very illustrious house of Sforza, and if any of the above mentioned things appear to you impossible or impracticable, I will offer to make an attempt at it in your park or in any other place which Your Excellency may please to choose, to which I commend myself in all humility.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200302130723.AA2354375pd80000256427@gard.com>

It has been a pleasure reading different views from geographically
dispersed professionals.
 
Dr. Tianzhen Hong, Dr. Konstantinos Papamichael and Prof. Murray Milne
suggested Visual DOE, BDA (Building Design Advisor) and an Architect
Friendly Simulation Tool. I have installed and used the first two last
year and higly recommend these tools depending on the purpose they
serve. As far as I remember I emailed Van Woods (BDA) about their
achievement regarding the tools. I didn't know about Murray's architect
friendly tool, I will download from the link provided. In short, Visual
DOE is a visual interface to the DOE Engine where as BDA can help
someone with formulation of the design in early phases. As explained in
Dr. Papamichael's email it also links to other simulation engines (What
some people call matrix cruncher) like DOE, Delight and ECM. I don't
have any doubt about their contribution towards better design.
 
1.	All these tools require a great deal of effort to set up and run
the simulation engine. Some can understand or grasp software's
functionality quicker than the others. Running energy simulation or
making a building energy efficient is not the only thing an architect
does. (S)he deals with a lot of complex issues. It is the architect who
sketches the form of the building and tries to explain it to others. It
is nearly impossible to include BSE (Building Services Engineer) in this
stage. Say, when I am sketching a concept, I usually work on the form
(That's 50% of the energy conscious design). Well, I know about the
guidelines available or what can make the building more energy efficient
- but I am never sure of how the building performs (to be precise, its
form). Mr. Calbert, I agree with you, it is always better to have BSE's
in the team from early design stages, but architecture is not only an
engineered product, it also satisfies some aesthetic, philosophical
purposes. Even when some architects work in the team - concept comes
from one person and it's a blackbox/ intuitive thing - matter of complex
cognitive activities of humans. Of course, the design gets refined from
brainstorming activities, but before that most of the decisive decisions
are taken. During early stages ideas, concepts, data and information all
are ill-structured, ill-defined. Apart from aesthetic - engineering
controversy, think from a business point of view - some architectural
firms can't afford to have a separate BSE in the team. Some of the
designs are won through competitions and there's no project management
team to oversee these collaborations. 
2.	It is now easier to define geometry and run a simulation than
say, 5 years ago. But these tools are not integrated with the design
process, rather they force you to get out of drawing program (which is
now ** 3D object based **) and start another simulation software, define
or draw your geometry again, define HVAC system (if required) and run
the simulation. Why do I need to define the geometry whereas I have
already done that in CAD software? You might say, you can draw your
geometry in VISIO or ArchiCAD or ADT (Architectural Desktop) and export
is in .IFC (Industrial Foundation Classes) format and import it to
EnergyPlus. Is it from the CAD software you are doing all these? Nope.
You export your CAD file to .IFC format. Use separate utility to map
.IFC file to .IDF(EnergyPlus input file). Here's the point: What if you
want to change your window and see how the building performs? You will
have to go back to your CAD software and redo the whole thing again and
again until you find something satisfactory.
3.	What I said earlier, we have great analytical simulation tools
like DOE, EnergyPlus, Lightscape as matrix cruncher; We have IFC (though
a prototype) or gbXML or ifcXML as specification to represent building
information; we have some CAD tools with IFC implementation (ArchiCAD,
VISIO, ADT .); we also have BDA as interface to these matrix crunchers -
WHY NOT A TOOL WHICH WILL FIT WITHIN THE EXISTING DESIGN DOMAINS WITHOUT
THE NEED TO CHANGE THE PROCESS? All my geometric information is within
ArchiCAD/ ADT/ VISIO - and I don't want to specify again. The
information is not lines or 3D extrusion from 2D shapes - these are rich
- It contains all the information I need to input into Energy Simulation
software.
 
Peter DeWilde has rightfully addressed some of the issues describing
IAI-IFC initiative and Fried Augenbroe's DAI initiative. IFC's a mammoth
task as they want to represent the whole industry and every process in
that. To get a matured representation for use in the real-life
scenarios, I believe we will have to wait couple of more years. But I
have reservations about the way Building Simulation industry as a whole
is proceeding. Vendors want to implement their own data standards
without any sympathy to existing process and initiatives. On the other
hand, we are slow to uptake new technologies; e.g. XML came after IFCs.
If the industry took a greater initiative to implement XMLs than IFCs,
probably we wouldn't need to talk about all these now -> without any
disrespect to IFC or ISO-STEP (which is hard for novice software
developer to understand and implement).
 
Peter also mentioned that for a "blackbox" intuitive simulation tool,
some sacrifices need to be made in terms of efficiency and accuracy of
the result. All the analytical simulation tool (not intuitive ones!)
makes a lot of assumptions and these are also termed as "near accurate".
All an architect needs is a feel for the energy performance of the
proposed solution. Not detailed analysis (CFD) or detailed design (BSE's
are for that). We would be happy with the near accurate (!) things.
 
Research only shows the way, sometimes it is not directly a marketable
product. Unless and until we have a reliable commercial product,
holistic concept of "Energy Conservation" will be limited to conference
and journal papers, workshops and seminars. Think of DOS and Windows -
if all the computers of the world were run using DOS, would you have
millions of users?

Dear list members,

With interest I see how the discussion on 'bridging the gap between design and simulation' instantly brings the list to life. It seems this is still a hot topic. Please let me add to the discussion by asking a few questions, on which I add my own personal opions and reasoning:  


* should architects conduct simulation efforts themselves, or should that be carried out by 'domain experts' cq consultants?

As Monjur Mourshed and Murray Milne clearly show, architects *are* interested in simulation. I think all design teams are perfectly interested in obtaining relevant performance information that helps them increase (or at least guarantee) the quality of their building designs. However, that is not equivalent to always having architects carry out simulations themselves. I think there is an argument for seeing building design as a team effort, where experts collaborate (the architect as design expert, working together with a structural engineer, HVAC-consultant, building physics expert, ....). Fried Augenbroe points out in his keynote paper for BS01 that no architect will take the risk of not involving domain experts when designing a large and complex buildings such as the Sony Center. My personal feeling is that with increasingly stringent requirements (like the new performance based building codes) this trend will continue. 


* how is the current cooperation between architects and consultants, and how do simulation tools help or hinder that cooperation?

I strongly support the take of Roberd Lord and Jeffrey Calbert, who observe that HVAC engineers and architects have difficulties in sharing responsabilities and concerns. For my own PhD-project (still ongoing, in this very field) I have done a couple of case-studies and a survey in order to investigate the use of simulation tools to support the selection of energy saving technologies in 70 high-profile energy efficient buildings here in the Netherlands. From this work it becomes clear that the selection of such technologies is mostly based on intuition and analogy, even when consultants/simulation experts are involved in the decision making and tools (as well as experienced users) are available when the decision is to be made. 
I therefore believe that 'process' and 'tools' interact in creating the integration problem: as long as design decisions take place in an intuitive manner, computational results will not have much impact on those decisions; on the other hand, when relevant computation results are not at hand when the decision is to be made, this forces the decision-maker to use intuition. Both problems need to be addressed simulataneously.


* is the development of 'intuitive tools' indeed the best way to bridge the gap, or do we need to explore other paths as well?

I think 'intuitive tools' are helpful when it comes to help an architect in making design decisions **in situations where there is no simulation expert** in support. Intuitive tools however also carry a risk: hiding functionalities etc in order to make tools easy to use also turns them into a kind of "black boxes", which decreases the trust non-expert-users have in these tools.

Supporting design teams is another game, with it's own problems. In this field, the approach of SESG is one road; other options are the continued efforts on the IAI-IFC, work embedding design-simulation interaction in a (process)context-sensitive interface (like for instance Fried Augenbroe's  DAI-Initiative in which I particpated last year), or complete redevelopment of simulation tools 'a la' SEMPER. 

Overall, I have the feeling we should be working towards very flexible, configurable tools (or rather interfaces to a whole set of tools!) that allow to capture the context of the analysis work, thereby guaranteeing that we gain access to the right type and granularity of building analysis for each specific design question that pops up. Which is definitely NOT an easy goal to reach!


Looking forward to your reactions and opions,

I have been reading with great interest the discussion above.  I believe
many are looking at the topic from the wrong perspective.  Historically, the
best building projects have resulted when there is a partnership between the
architect and the design engineer (and other building construction
disciplines).  Although I do not work for a consulting engineer, I spend all
my time working with them, and I find many of them frustrated because they
are not brought into the consortium until the building architectural plans
are nearly complete.  The result is that critical design decisions that
impact the efficiency of the building are already made without the input of
the most capable expert in this area.

An HVAC design engineer should be involved with the project at inception so
he can serve as a resource to the architect and help direct the building
creation with an eye toward efficiency.  Most consulting engineers have
access to any number of analysis programs that they use routinely in this
kind of work.  Many of those programs use data already defined in the
preliminary load estimating modeling (as appropriate).  While the energy
simulation side is oriented to a different need than load estimating, much
of the building geometry is the same for both.  In reality, the amount of
work involved in performing a full energy simulation now is very little
compared to a few years ago, especially with the computing power now
available.  These tools can handle any size project and are very accurate in
the hands of a practitioner.  They can be used progressively as the project
moves forward and the inevitable changes occur. 

I believe this is a better way to achieve project energy efficiency than
looking for "simplified shortcuts" for the architect to use.

To reply to Monjur M Mourshed:

As an architect, I agree with your comments. Because so many of the 
decisions that determine a building's energy performance are made at the 
very beginning of the design process, architects need a 'day-one' tool.  I 
think it is possible to design much more intuitive interfaces to 
sophisticated calculation algorithms.

For example, we have just released an "architect friendly" energy 
simulation tool. It emphasized the building envelope, windows, shading, 
orientation, etc., allwing you to draw in a floor plan and click and drag 
windows onto each elevation. But behind this interface is an 8760 hour heat 
balance engine that was validated against DOE2 and Blast etc. using the 
ASHRAE Standard 140-2001. Currently it works only for single zone buildings 
up to 120'x120', and the HVAC system definition is very generic. It is 
intended for residential ratepayers of Southern California Edison, but the 
web site shows how to use it for other climates and other building types. 
It is free from www.aud.ucla.edu/heed  so you can take a look to see if 
this is closer to the kind of intuitive tool that you think architects need.

The best experience I have had is using Building Design Advisor (BDA).
It was designed to be used by architects from the very beginning of the
design process. The program just requires the data that the designer has
in every stage, using smart default values for the unknown parameters.
 
The building database is very well organized and in many ways remembers
the Revit's database.

You may also want to try the Building Design Advisor (BDA) software,
available at http://gaia.lbl.gov/bda.  The BDA software is designed for the
very early, schematic phases of building design.  The current version
supports the integrated use of three simulation tools: DElight
(daylighting), ECM (electric lighting) and DOE-2.1E.

To reply to Monjur M Mourshed:

As an architect, I agree with your comments. Because so many of the 
decisions that determine a building's energy performance are made at the 
very beginning of the design process, architects need a 'day-one' tool.  I 
think it is possible to design much more intuitive interfaces to 
sophisticated calculation algorithms.

For example, we have just released an "architect friendly" energy 
simulation tool. It emphasized the building envelope, windows, shading, 
orientation, etc., allowing you to draw in a floor plan and click and drag 
windows onto each elevation. But behind this interface is an 8760 hour heat 
balance engine that was validated against DOE2 and Blast etc. using the 
ASHRAE Standard 140-2001. Currently it works only for single zone buildings 
up to 120'x120', and the HVAC system definition is very generic. It is 
intended for residential ratepayers of Southern California Edison, but the 
web site shows how to use it for other climates and other building types. 
It is free from www.aud.ucla.edu/heed  so you can take a look to see if 
this is closer to the kind of intuitive tool that you think architects need.

perhaps an alternative perspective is for architects to utilise software that statistically predicts comfort levels or provides lighting levels (i.e. models the benefit) without too much angst, hence defining the critical properties for the architecture & HVAC systems...An example of such a program is TAS which can export into Lightscape. While not being ideal for whole-of-building energy exercises, it provides the 80% for 20% effort and can render reasonably well...Both of these tools could be shared by engineers to detailed system selection and energy analysis. Having been through a recent sharing exercise myself, there is a need for some sort of architect training to understand the program's science..

can I just stir the pot a bit by saying that I am saddened that (typically) HVAC engineers & architects cannot share responsibilities or concerns...the energy efficiency question is just selecting the most efficient manner to do something, but whether we need to do that thing in the first place is a question that doesn't get half the effort of energy simulation...

Quick note to clarify some points in Dr. Hand's reply

[Dr. Hand]
I have been following the dialog on getting Architects interested in and
competent with simulation.

My View:
In my opinion, Architects (being one myself) are more than interested to
use Energy Simulation tools provided that they are available and they
can be used intuitively. To perform basic simulations that is required
in early stages (before HVAC comes to the scene), architects are well
equipped with required knowledge and concepts.

[Dr. Hand]
We do this via supported technology deployments which put computers 
with relevant simulation software and simulation staff into design 
practices (from one-man-bands to multi-national practices).

My View:
I appreciate very much these attempts at mitigating industry drawbacks
by advocating ad-hoc concepts like STD. But it seems, we as a whole
industry failing recurrently to understand one important fact: we need a
tool that doesn't need another specialist to explain and run. Architects
want a tool that can be used without asking BSE (Building Services
Engineer) what a particular parameter means; simulation can be run
without leaving CAD tool and the same for result visualization. For
detailed HVAC design assistance from specialists will be sought out, but
for basic understanding of the building's performance is it worth to ask
BSE's help?

I do understand that Architects (in Academia) need to conduct research
on how Energy Simulation tools can be used and adopted to the design
process and they also need to sort out interface issues.

All the technology is available (to do what architects want) right now.
Nobody seems to take an initiative to develop reliable commercial
software. From my experience in using different Energy Simulation tools
I can tell, you need to know how the software works than what you want
to do. That may be ok for academic purposes as like mine but it is not
feasible for a practising architect.

70's to 00's: that's 3 decades -> Energy Conservation and Sustainability
is being emphasized. How far did we achieve except for a few buildings

Wade,
 
You can make your own HW-Blr-HIR-fPLR cubic curve for PowerDoe using Excel.
You can plot boiler efficiency and the boiler input ratio (as defined by
powerdoe) and create a third order polynomial trend line of the resulting
graph.  Have Excel display the trendline equation and then input the
coefficients into a new curve fit in Powerdoe.  The Powerdoe Help files and
documentation do a good job of discussing how curve fits work and how to
create your own.  There is also a detailed help screen that discusses the
Boiler Heat Input Ratio.
 
If you add your curve fits to a custom library they will always be there for
you to use.
 
Good luck,

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Boiler Performance Curves



Hello All,
 
As part of a comprehensive energy study for a new elementary school, we are
analyzing fuel savings opportunities for a proposed boiler with fully
modulating burners as compared to a base-case sectional lo-hi-lo boiler.  So
far, we have found that, all things being equal, there are no significant
savings associated with such a measure (at least not for the boiler size and
models we've been considering).
 
We use PowerDOE for most of our energy simulations.  In the course of this
study, we have come to question the default boiler part-load
heat-input-ratio curve (HW-Blr-HIR-fPLR) found in Bdllib.dat.  Until now, we
have applied this curve to most base-case boiler calculations (perhaps
mistakenly?).  Does anyone know of the origins of this curve or what it
would have been based upon?  Most manufacturers we have spoken with state
that peak boiler efficiency occurs between 25% and 50% load.  Using the
default curve, peak performance occurs at full load and efficiency decreases
by nearly 10% at half load.
 
Also, if this curve is in error, can anyone suggest a method for developing
a more reasonable curve estimate?
 
Thanks,
Wade

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] getting the whole design team into the performance
assessment game.



I have been following the dialog on getting Architects interested in and
competent with simulation. Members of the list might like to see another
way design professionals in Europe are exploring simulation by visiting
the Scottish Energy Systems Group site <http://www.sesg.strath.ac.uk>.
SESG is the Scottish affiliate of IBPSA.

We do this via supported technology deployments which put computers
with relevant simulation software and simulation staff into design
practices (from one-man-bands to multi-national practices) so that
practitioners can better evaluate simulation and/or increase their
skills in simulation in the context of actual projects.

Last year we managed dozens of deployments for our members, provided
training for even more practitioners on a range of simulation tools.
Not only is simulation is getting used, vendors are selling quite
a bit of software. If you are interested, the web page has instructions
for getting the SESG newsletter.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Boiler Performance Curves
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200302121304.AA0431500pd80000255888@gard.com>

Hello All,

As part of a comprehensive energy study for a new elementary school, we are analyzing fuel savings opportunities for a proposed boiler with fully modulating burners as compared to a base-case sectional lo-hi-lo boiler.  So far, we have found that, all things being equal, there are no significant savings associated with such a measure (at least not for the boiler size and models we've been considering).

We use PowerDOE for most of our energy simulations.  In the course of this study, we have come to question the default boiler part-load heat-input-ratio curve (HW-Blr-HIR-fPLR) found in Bdllib.dat.  Until now, we have applied this curve to most base-case boiler calculations (perhaps mistakenly?).  Does anyone know of the origins of this curve or what it would have been based upon?  Most manufacturers we have spoken with state that peak boiler efficiency occurs between 25% and 50% load.  Using the default curve, peak performance occurs at full load and efficiency decreases by nearly 10% at half load.

Also, if this curve is in error, can anyone suggest a method for developing a more reasonable curve estimate?

Thanks,
Wade

I agree with your point that energy conservation should begin with
Architects but I have reservation about how to implement it, given the
current circumstances. Energy simulation is a complex task oriented
process. It needs a lot of parameters to be specified to kick off and
that might not be available when a designer/ Architect starts the
design. 
 
Another point to note is the lack of integrated UI (User Interface) - be
it graphical or textual. Most of the researches in Energy Simulation /
Conservation are aimed at developing stand-alone utility or piece of
software to do certain job. In my opinion, the emphasis should be placed
on the integration with the design process and final outcome or product.
For example, I want to kick off Energy Simulation module from within the
CAD software I am working with, without specifying further parameters
and I want to check for energy consumption after every change I made to
the layout or component. I don't want to open a different window or
software and spend a week to define and run the simulation. You might as
well say IFC or STEP is there to help. To be honest these specifications
seem just prototypes to me, I have reservations about them being used in
real life situations - not in next 3/5 years at least.
 
It is wisely said; know your target audience before you even think to
code your software. Knowingly or unknowingly, Most of the software/
Interfaces are targeted towards HVAC Engineers, not architects. There's
a fundamental difference in the think/ work process of an architect with
Engineers. I don't think architects are too comfortable with what's
available out there, commercially or research wise. This is the only
reason for not using them in profession. Nobody has problems with
learning something new, if it increases the quality of the product or
increases efficiency of the process.

Warren,
 
I'm sure you have seen the discussion of eQUEST over the last few days.
I consider it and it's DOE-2.2 calculation engine the best available for
serious production energy simulation. My business is energy simulation
for other engineers and architects, and we do probably 90 percent of our
work with eQUEST/DOE-2.2.  It can even do rudimentary modeling, though
probably not what you would want to present to a client.  eQUEST's
wizard makes preliminary analysis very quick and easy.  You can then
take that model as far as you want with the Detailed Edit Mode.
 
On the other hand, any good simulation program will have a significant
learning curve.  I believe eQUEST to have the best user interface
available, but the program is not trivial to learn and use properly.  I
have worked with Marlin Addison on presenting two day eQUEST training
seminars to engineers and architects.  Normally, after a seminar, about
10 percent of the participants will contact me with questions,
indicating to me that they are actually using the program.  While I have
felt for a long time that energy conservation should start with the
architect, few of the seminar participants are architects and I cannot
remember a single architect with a follow up question.
 
I would highly recommend that whatever program makes your short list,
you attend a training seminar to determine if it is practical for you to
actually use the program.  I would be happy to talk or email further
about this subject.

Hello All:
 
I have a request. I am an architect in North Carolina, and it is my job
to choose the next generation of software that my office will use in the
production of construction documents. On the one hand, I am considering
a 3D modeling program, such as Revit, in order to take advantage of both
the parametric and rendering capabilities. However, I also have a strong
interest in promoting high performance design. Therefore, I was hoping
there exists a program that can fluidly incorporate energy analysis into
the modeling software. Maybe there is even something on the horizon.
 
Any suggestions?

great start! thanks Eric and Sayyed. I shall contact Martin and Nader for more information on CoolT. I had read about this software and the I am concerned about two issues - 1. does the simulation accomodate water spray through nozzles as against water pads? and 2. is the airflow rate given at the exit of the tower or at any point within the building? I am yet to finalyse the topic of study and have around 4 months to work on it. suggestions on current problems and potential areas of study in cool towers will be helpful.

Contact Martin Yoklic at the University of Arizona.  He works at the Environmental Research Laboratory (ERL) there.  His life work (started in college) has been on passive evaporative ?Cool Towers.?  He has written several papers on this subject.  Frankly speaking, I could not find a simulation program that would dynamically adjust itself to a varying load like DOE2 does.  He has a software program which basically says if the ambient wet bulb temperature is ?x?, the wind is ?y?, the cross section area of the evaporative media is ?a?, the elevation of the pads is ?b?, the cross section area of the tower is ?l?, the exit area is ?m?, and given the thickness of the media ?q? with a ?z? approach, then you will get ?c? flow of ?d? degree air.

 

Can?t remember if that is exactly how it worked, but it is similar to that.  In order for him to perform the calculation, I had to provide him with a weather file with the variables I outlined above among other static variables.

 

He also has an Architectural degree.  Maybe he?ll try to lure you to the University of Arizona.  At least you?d still be in the PAC 10.

Hello Sangeetha,
 
I have used the downdraft evaporative cooling calculation tool which, as
mentioned by Eric, was developed by Martin Yoklic and Nader Chalfoun at
Univ. of Arizona. The tool is called `Cool T', and is a very nifty and easy
to use (and only 88kb in size). I think it has been validated using data
from some cool towers built in Tucson and elsewhere. The big limitation with
that program is that it can only simulate the towers in only 6 locations
(Phoenix USA, Tucson USA, Riyadh Saudi Arabia, Gabarone Botswana, Dubai UAE
and Long Beach USA). A classmate of mine ( geraldpde at hotmail.com
<mailto:geraldpde at hotmail.com> ) at Arizona State Univ. is working on
developing a Java based interface and engine which can take in different
weather files (TMY2 or EPW). I am sure Nader and Martin can help you best.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200302120753.AA5323578pd80000255587@gard.com>

Hello All:

I have a request. I am an architect in North Carolina, and it is my job to choose the next generation of software that my office will use in the production of construction documents. On the one hand, I am considering a 3D modeling program, such as Revit, in order to take advantage of both the parametric and rendering capabilities. However, I also have a strong interest in promoting high performance design. Therefore, I was hoping there exists a program that can fluidly incorporate energy analysis into the modeling software. Maybe there is even something on the horizon.

Any suggestions?

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200302111928.AA2815671pd80000255327@gard.com>

Contact Martin Yoklic at the University of Arizona.  He works at the
Environmental Research Laboratory (ERL) there.  His life work (started in
college) has been on passive evaporative 'Cool Towers."  He has written
several papers on this subject.  Frankly speaking, I could not find a
simulation program that would dynamically adjust itself to a varying load
like DOE2 does.  He has a software program which basically says if the
ambient wet bulb temperature is "x", the wind is "y", the cross section area
of the evaporative media is "a", the elevation of the pads is "b", the cross
section area of the tower is "l", the exit area is "m", and given the
thickness of the media "q" with a "z" approach, then you will get "c" flow
of "d" degree air.
 
Can't remember if that is exactly how it worked, but it is similar to that.
In order for him to perform the calculation, I had to provide him with a
weather file with the variables I outlined above among other static
variables.
 
He also has an Architectural degree.  Maybe he'll try to lure you to the
University of Arizona.  At least you'd still be in the PAC 10.

Good discussions so far!  My 2 cents worth concerns my own pre- and 
post-processing routine, using an EXCEL spreadsheet to create DOE2.1E input 
files and receive 8760 outputs for processing.  Therefore I am waiting for 
other codes to become as versatile and reliable as 2.1E before I 
voluntarily scrap this approach and start over.  Also, I need functions for 
8760 input of end-use data on lighting and miscellaneous loads.  Finally, 
the thought of switching to an entirely new code (not so much DOE2.2 as 
EnergyPlus) that doesn't have the debugging and verification history of 
2.1E really concerns me right now.

I must admit we miss the function capabilities of 2.1e. Not that I used
it very often but I've got a computer geek that did. We end up faking
things more often when we used to be able to plug our own patch into the
code. I seem to remember hearing that this ability was `almost' in 2.2
but the last bit of implementation is awaiting sufficient interest (i.e.
$). Perhaps Scott can update us. 

I'm also under the impression, from good sources, that the bulk of the
2.2 code is so closely based on 2.1e that the historical verification is
still valid. Perhaps not as much with new 2.2 features. 

 

Loop errors can be a pain, especially since they aren't caught in BDL
processing. We've managed to prevent most of them by careful review of
inputs but they still occasionally pop up. Other than that the latest
2.2 versions have rarely crashed and even the latest eQuest versions
crash much more infrequently than earlier versions. 

 

As for features - I'm sure we could all list a number that we'd love to
see. In a perfect world..

Let's keep up the discussion.

The loops and plant in DOE 2.2 are great, the real OA HXs, and better
economizer ctrls are great, and the window module is nifty, and Equest
is amazing freeware, but .....

We still use DOE 2.1 in lots of commercial work. In my experience DOE
2.2 crashes much more often. Often this seems to be associated with
excessive flow demands on a loop, but the process of debugging is much
more frustrating than errors caught by the BDL processor. Perhaps some
checking is built into Equest or PowerDOE, and so is not done in BDL.
Recent versions are better, but not immune by any means. 

DOE 2.2 does not implement the custom "functions" which we use to input
better space daylight level correlations derived from Radiance, etc, to
the DOE2 daylighting routine. Occasionally we've used functions for
other things, but this usually did seem like an exercise better suited
to academia!

Only version 41j of DOE2.2 had tower free cooling, in 41i this feature
was removed. Perhaps there is a work-around I have not thought of; many
of our larger modeled buildings use flat-plate HXs for modest winter CHW
loads. (The Canadians use these extensively instead of air-side
economizers, for a variety of good reasons.)

We've never found a GUI or wizard that managed multiple ECM runs as well
as some spreadsheet or database methods we use. The available front-ends
for 2.1 and 2.2 do generate initial model inputs, particularly geometry,
nicely in most cases. As far as I know, both can be used for code
compliance, as long as the code or design does not require or use
waterside economizing.

Anyone else care to comment?

Here in Canada, the Model National Energy Code, Performance Option
required simulation using EE4 (a free compliance tool http://www.ee4.com

eQuest, you can use EE4 to quickly generate an input file then edit it

surprised to hear of modelers (often in Academic situations) still
working with 2.1e when `2.2 is a significant improvement and is
absolutely free via eQuest. 

I, like John, am holding off on EnergyPlus until I can justify the
tremendous expense of training my people on a new product that is still
not ready for prime time. Eventually, I hope, but not yet. I m guessing
five years before there is a product that is enough better than eQuest
to justify the investment. (And that s assuming eQuest doesn t continue
to improve). 

I imagine that there are numerous eQuest users that are not aware of the

about this forum on their web site or to everyone who down loads eQuest.

We also use eQuest on our design jobs, in a similar fashion. Often we use
the wizard to input as much as possible and then we typically have to bail
out and use the detailed interface. Sometimes we have to bail out of eQuest
and use the most recent build of the DOE2.2 engine directly. We provide
constant feedback to the developers of both eQuest and the DOE2.2 engine
regarding bugs or problems we are encountering. 
 
I would be interested in a User Group.

about this forum on their web site or to everyone who down loads eQuest.

John,

 

There are at least a few of us out here using eQUEST/DOE-2.2 on a regular
basis.  I started using DOE-2.1 back when it was Cal-ERDA 1.3 (about 1979)
and have followed the Hirsch upgrades through PowerDOE and eQUEST.  I have
only seen a Beta version of eQUEST 3.0, but it looks very interesting.

 

My specialty is energy simulation and I use eQUEST and the "Detailed Data
Edit" Mode on almost all of our energy simulation jobs.  JJ Hirsch and
Associates are looking for ways to offer more support, but probably at a
price.  I can offer some support, free if it is trivial (to me) or at my
regular rates if it is more involved.  Our web site is
http://www.roberts-engineering.com/ <http://www.roberts-engineering.com/> .
Hopefully, you will find some useful information there.

 

I think the User Group is a good idea, though you already have a discussion
forum through BLDG-SIM at gard.com <mailto:BLDG-SIM at gard.com> .  Let me know
how much interest you get.

 

Mike

May I ask how many people are attempting to use eQuest/DOE-2.2? I would like
to form a User Group for exchanging questions and war stories, as the
creators of the program do not apparently have funding for very much support
(Sad).

I have taken Marlin Addison's a few times, with the last version I have
(3.0) FINALLY beginning to make sense. I have used DOE-2.1 since 1984 and
have some small familiarity with the intent, switches, and boundaries of the
program. Until a decent front end come along for EnergyPlus, this is the way
I am going.

There claims to be over 7,000 downloads of the program. Anyone getting into
the "world past the Wizards" yet?

The BLDG-SIM archive has been updated to cover through 
today.  The archive was last updated in December.  About 60 
messages were added.   

The BLDG-SIM mailing list page is:

  http://www.gard.com/ml/bldg-sim.htm

Sorted by topic:

  http://www.gard.com/ml/bldg-sim-archive/threads.html

Sorted by date:

I have changed the settings on the software that prepares 
the archive to hide the e-mail addresses that appear.  
Hopefully, this will decrease the chance of a e-mail 
address "spider" from gathering our e-mail addresses 
resulting in less spam.

Although not part of the archive, you may also want to look 
at the "Building Simulation Weather Data Resources" page:
