Dear all,

When you are rotating the building through 4 different orientations, do you
change the glazing so that the glazing with the highest SHGC is always faces
north, or do you put the glazing with high SHGC on the original north
facade, and then rotate the building so that the high SHGC glazing faces the
east, south and west orientations in subsequent simulations?

Yours faithfully,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Performance Rating Method of of Ashrae 90.1 (2004)
	Baseline Chiller COP
In-Reply-To: <000401c8fcdf$c9d3b2e0$a32012b2@hotinkit>
Message-ID: <D83FD813F91349C98DF04F42F88467FF@hotinkit>

Regarding to the Performance Rating Method of of Ashrae 90.1 (2004), there
is an issue of  determining baseline Chiller COP need to be clarified.

Regarding to the baseline HVAC system, the parameters need to be set
according to Appendix G of Ashrae 90.1 Standard.
According to table G3.1.1A and table G3.1.1B of App. G3.1.1, the baseline
HVAC system for a building with area larger than 150,000 sqft is specified
as variable air volume with reheat with centrifugal chiller >300tons,
whereas the equipment efficiencies should be modeled at the minimum
efficiency levels in accordance with section 6.4 of Ashrae 90.1 Standard.
Then referring to table 6.8.1 J of section 6.4 of Ashrae 90.1 Standard,
minimum efficiencies for centrifugal chiller COP(standard) should be 6.1.

However, What is the minimum efficiencies for the baseline design COP under
the following condition,
1) If the proposed HVAC design is design to work with leaving chilled water
at 42.8F and entering condenser water temperature of 85F,
2) If the proposed HVAC design is design to work with leaving chilled water
at 42.8F and entering condenser water temperature of 89.6F, and this chiller
is designed to be a ice storage system.

Should the baseline design be modeled at COP 6.1 or should the baseline COP
be estimated by the equations listed below the table 6.8.1 J?

Please advise.

Thanks you for any kindly helps.

I would be glad to set up a new mailing list for users of 
IES-VE using onebuilding.org, all we need is a name. 
Unfortunately, I do not have permission to name the list 
IES-VE-users or VE-users or anything that might be 
trademarked. If someone can come up with a good name that is 
not trademarked, I will set up a new mailing list.

building. (e.g., I assign the "North" glazing characteristics to the
elevation that, after rotating, faces North)

This is an interesting discussion (one that may have already occurred
previously).  According to the 90.1 User Manual:

 

"SHGC - The budget building design's fenestration solar heat gain
coefficient is set to the maximum required for the climate.  The
prescriptive standards give SHGC criteria for all orientations and
provide an exception for north facing fenestration.  The exception is
not used for the baseline building; the criteria for all orientations
are used for all orientations..."

 

However, even the LEED-NC EAc1 template differentiates between the North
SHGC and the rest of the fenestration....if the exception is not to be
used, why would the USGBC have a place to enter the SHGC(north) for the
baseline building??  And why would they accept two different SHGCs for
the baseline building on the template?

 

I can't seem to find any NC or CS CIRs that address this.

Dear Ulrik,

 

Since the intent of the Standard is to assign the better glazing
performance to non-North walls, I always rotate the glazing
characteristics with the building. (e.g., I assign the "North" glazing
characteristics to the elevation that, after rotating, faces North)

Dear all,

When you are rotating the building through 4 different orientations, do
you change the glazing so that the glazing with the highest SHGC is
always faces north, or do you put the glazing with high SHGC on the
original north facade, and then rotate the building so that the high
SHGC glazing faces the east, south and west orientations in subsequent
simulations?

Sorry, I should have read further before posting.  In the LEED-NC
reference guide, it states:

 

"The four Baseline Design energy models are identical to each other,
except that the building orientation for each model is modified as
described in ASHRAE Std 90.1 Table G3.5.1a, and the window SHGCs are
revised to reflect the minimum ASHRAE Building Envelope Requirements for
the revised building orientation."

 

In other words, the USGBC, whether on purpose or not, has provided its
own exception to 90.1 that allows you to use the SHGC(north) in the
baseline models.  And yes, after rotating, you have to reassign the
proper SHGCs to the new "north".

I'm no statistician, but I've always been dubious about that calculation.
You are taking the mean of two means, which seems to be getting farther
and farther from actual data.

It also seems to punish some of the climates that are best suited for
natural ventilation, since having cool nights significantly drops the
acceptability limits. I assume they are pushing you to take advantage of
night pre-cooling and thermal mass, but I find it curious that there are
no allowable hours outside of the range. All of the pre-cooling in the
world isn't going to help you keep the temperatures down during that one
string of 90 degree days in the tmy2 file...

There is a small difference between the arithmetic mean of the monthly 
mean max and min and the overall arithmetic mean of 720 hours of weather 
data. Like you say, it's probably a legacy from the old pen and paper
days.
I've heard that some would use occupied period only to calculate the 
mean. However, I can not find any reference in the text of A55 to 
justify this. Being able to average the warmer occupied hours would make 
things a whole lot easier - even the 80% acceptability temperature can 
regularly be lower than the summertime peaks. It's a tough call for 
natural ventilation.

Many thanks

All;
I certainly do NOT think the 2007 PRM requires that the baseline glazing "North" SHGCs be "moved" as the "North" exposures change in each of the simulations that generates the "baseline building performance." I could see how one might think that, but say it ain't so. I assume the baseline "North" SHGC is applied to what would be "North" glazing in the proposed and unrotated baseline models, and those glazing parameters are left in place for that facade as the baseline model is rotated. I don't think this has been fodder for a USGBC CIR or ASHRAE interpretation yet, but maybe I'm out of touch. Addendum A to 2004, which removed the glazing redistribution requirement, still used SHGC_all for all baseline glazing. I thought this had been incorporated verbatim in the 2007 edits but noooooo. Time to get out the magnifier and channel my inner attorney.

A90.1-2007 removed the reference to SHGC_All and refers to the Chapter 5 tables. You should be able to use the SHGC_north in the baseline if you follow 2007.

In Northern Virginia I use an opening roof skylight to dump excessive

This operational variation is only practiced the last week of September

depending depending on  the particular year's weather

It would be appropriate to use mean monthly temperature for calculating

Hi Brandon;

I've been doing some "reverse engineering," and I keep coming back to the
same problem: my FLOOR AND SPACE polygons appear in eQuest exactly where I
expect them to, but all of the EXTERIOR-WALL polygons, if no translations
are applied (ie X, Y, Z, AZIMUTH, TILT = 0) , appear rotated 180 degrees
around the building coordinate X axis relative to where I would expect them
to be. Also, oddly, the TILT and AZIMUTH transformations, when specified,
take place relative to this rotated coordinate system -- ie, the AZIMUTH
rotation is about the buidling coordinate *negative *z-axis -- while the
translation transformation (as specified by X, Y, and Z) take place as
expected (in the building coordinate system).

Very strange stuff. I get the feeling that this has something to do with the
EXTERIOR-WALL coordinate system being dependant on the SPACE coordinate
system which is, in turn, dependant on the FLOOR coordinate system. As it
stands, my FLOOR, SPACE, and EXTERIOR WALL object that represents the floor
all use the same POLYGON object -- does anyone know if this in itself is a
problem? My instinct is that I'm somehow misunderstanding this relationship,
but I've done some fiddling in this regard and haven't been able to change
very much...

Again, if anyone has any insight on this issue, it would be greatly
appreciated.

Thanks a lot,

Josh

Dear all,

When you are rotating the building through 4 different orientations, do you
change the glazing so that the glazing with the highest SHGC is always faces
north, or do you put the glazing with high SHGC on the original north
facade, and then rotate the building so that the high SHGC glazing faces the
east, south and west orientations in subsequent simulations?

Yours faithfully,

    Baseline Chiller COP

Message-ID: <D83FD813F91349C98DF04F42F88467FF at hotinkit>
Content-Type: text/plain;    charset="us-ascii"

Regarding to the Performance Rating Method of of Ashrae 90.1 (2004), there
is an issue of  determining baseline Chiller COP need to be clarified.

Regarding to the baseline HVAC system, the parameters need to be set
according to Appendix G of Ashrae 90.1 Standard.
According to table G3.1.1A and table G3.1.1B of App. G3.1.1, the baseline
HVAC system for a building with area larger than 150,000 sqft is specified
as variable air volume with reheat with centrifugal chiller >300tons,
whereas the equipment efficiencies should be modeled at the minimum
efficiency levels in accordance with section 6.4 of Ashrae 90.1 Standard.
Then referring to table 6.8.1 J of section 6.4 of Ashrae 90.1 Standard,
minimum efficiencies for centrifugal chiller COP(standard) should be 6.1.

However, What is the minimum efficiencies for the baseline design COP under
the following condition,
1) If the proposed HVAC design is design to work with leaving chilled water
at 42.8F and entering condenser water temperature of 85F,
2) If the proposed HVAC design is design to work with leaving chilled water
at 42.8F and entering condenser water temperature of 89.6F, and this chiller
is designed to be a ice storage system.

Should the baseline design be modeled at COP 6.1 or should the baseline COP
be estimated by the equations listed below the table 6.8.1 J?

Please advise.

Thanks you for any kindly helps.

I would be glad to set up a new mailing list for users of 
IES-VE using onebuilding.org, all we need is a name. 
Unfortunately, I do not have permission to name the list 
IES-VE-users or VE-users or anything that might be 
trademarked. If someone can come up with a good name that is 
not trademarked, I will set up a new mailing list.

Dear Ulrik,

Since the intent of the Standard is to assign the better glazing performance
to non-North walls, I always rotate the glazing characteristics with the
building. (e.g., I assign the "North" glazing characteristics to the
elevation that, after rotating, faces North)

A90.1-2007 removed the reference to SHGC_All and refers to the Chapter 5
tables. You should be able to use the SHGC_north in the baseline if you
follow 2007.

This is an interesting discussion (one that may have already occurred
previously).  According to the 90.1 User Manual:



"SHGC - The budget building design's fenestration solar heat gain
coefficient is set to the maximum required for the climate.  The
prescriptive standards give SHGC criteria for all orientations and
provide an exception for north facing fenestration.  The exception is
not used for the baseline building; the criteria for all orientations
are used for all orientations..."



However, even the LEED-NC EAc1 template differentiates between the North
SHGC and the rest of the fenestration....if the exception is not to be
used, why would the USGBC have a place to enter the SHGC(north) for the
baseline building??  And why would they accept two different SHGCs for
the baseline building on the template?



I can't seem to find any NC or CS CIRs that address this.

Sorry, I should have read further before posting.  In the LEED-NC
reference guide, it states:



"The four Baseline Design energy models are identical to each other,
except that the building orientation for each model is modified as
described in ASHRAE Std 90.1 Table G3.5.1a, and the window SHGCs are
revised to reflect the minimum ASHRAE Building Envelope Requirements for
the revised building orientation."



In other words, the USGBC, whether on purpose or not, has provided its
own exception to 90.1 that allows you to use the SHGC(north) in the
baseline models.  And yes, after rotating, you have to reassign the
proper SHGCs to the new "north".

I'm no statistician, but I've always been dubious about that calculation.
You are taking the mean of two means, which seems to be getting farther
and farther from actual data.

It also seems to punish some of the climates that are best suited for
natural ventilation, since having cool nights significantly drops the
acceptability limits. I assume they are pushing you to take advantage of
night pre-cooling and thermal mass, but I find it curious that there are
no allowable hours outside of the range. All of the pre-cooling in the
world isn't going to help you keep the temperatures down during that one
string of 90 degree days in the tmy2 file...

There is a small difference between the arithmetic mean of the monthly 
mean max and min and the overall arithmetic mean of 720 hours of weather 
data. Like you say, it's probably a legacy from the old pen and paper
days.
I've heard that some would use occupied period only to calculate the 
mean. However, I can not find any reference in the text of A55 to 
justify this. Being able to average the warmer occupied hours would make 
things a whole lot easier - even the 80% acceptability temperature can 
regularly be lower than the summertime peaks. It's a tough call for 
natural ventilation.

Many thanks

All;
I certainly do NOT think the 2007 PRM requires that the baseline glazing "North" SHGCs be "moved" as the "North" exposures change in each of the simulations that generates the "baseline building performance." I could see how one might think that, but say it ain't so. I assume the baseline "North" SHGC is applied to what would be "North" glazing in the proposed and unrotated baseline models, and those glazing parameters are left in place for that facade as the baseline model is rotated. I don't think this has been fodder for a USGBC CIR or ASHRAE interpretation yet, but maybe I'm out of touch. Addendum A to 2004, which removed the glazing redistribution requirement, still used SHGC_all for all baseline glazing. I thought this had been incorporated verbatim in the 2007 edits but noooooo. Time to get out the magnifier and channel my inner attorney.

A90.1-2007 removed the reference to SHGC_All and refers to the Chapter 5 tables. You should be able to use the SHGC_north in the baseline if you follow 2007.

Dear Ulrik,
Since the intent of the Standard is to assign the better glazing performance to non-North walls, I always rotate the glazing characteristics with the building. (e.g., I assign the "North" glazing characteristics to the elevation that, after rotating, faces North)

Dear all,

When you are rotating the building through 4 different orientations, do you change the glazing so that the glazing with the highest SHGC is always faces north, or do you put the glazing with high SHGC on the original north facade, and then rotate the building so that the high SHGC glazing faces the east, south and west orientations in subsequent simulations?

Hi Brandon;

I've been doing some "reverse engineering," and I keep coming back to the
same problem: my FLOOR AND SPACE polygons appear in eQuest exactly where I
expect them to, but all of the EXTERIOR-WALL polygons, if no translations
are applied (ie X, Y, Z, AZIMUTH, TILT = 0) , appear rotated 180 degrees
around the building coordinate X axis relative to where I would expect them
to be. Also, oddly, the TILT and AZIMUTH transformations, when specified,
take place relative to this rotated coordinate system -- ie, the AZIMUTH
rotation is about the buidling coordinate *negative *z-axis -- while the
translation transformation (as specified by X, Y, and Z) take place as
expected (in the building coordinate system).

Very strange stuff. I get the feeling that this has something to do with the
EXTERIOR-WALL coordinate system being dependant on the SPACE coordinate
system which is, in turn, dependant on the FLOOR coordinate system. As it
stands, my FLOOR, SPACE, and EXTERIOR WALL object that represents the floor
all use the same POLYGON object -- does anyone know if this in itself is a
problem? My instinct is that I'm somehow misunderstanding this relationship,
but I've done some fiddling in this regard and haven't been able to change
very much...

Again, if anyone has any insight on this issue, it would be greatly
appreciated.

Thanks a lot,

Josh

Aha. Yes, there it is in the NC 2.2 revised EAc1 section, not under the
envelope heading of course. But if using the PRM from the 2007 App G, I
would reference the 2007 Users' Manual for further explanation and find
on G-16:
 
SHGC
"... The prescriptive standards give SHGC criteria
for all orientations and provide an
exception for north facing fenestration.
The exception is not used for the baseline
building; the criteria for all orientations are
used for all orientations. The maximum
SHGC is a function of the glazing
percentage, which is taken from the
proposed design or 40% of the gross
above-grade exterior wall, which ever is
less."
 
Which happens to be exactly the same text as in the 2004 UM. Of course,
if using 2007 App G, baseline models are supposed to reflect the more
stringent window parameters in Chapter 5.

Sorry, I should have read further before posting.  In the LEED-NC
reference guide, it states:

 
?The four Baseline Design energy models are identical to each other,
except that the building orientation for each model is modified as
described in ASHRAE Std 90.1 Table G3.5.1a, and the window SHGCs are
revised to reflect the minimum ASHRAE Building Envelope Requirements for
the revised building orientation.?
 
In other words, the USGBC, whether on purpose or not, has provided its
own exception to 90.1 that allows you to use the SHGC(north) in the
baseline models.  And yes, after rotating, you have to reassign the
proper SHGCs to the new ?north?.

This is an interesting discussion (one that may have already occurred
previously).  According to the 90.1 User Manual:
 
?SHGC ? The budget building design?s fenestration solar heat gain
coefficient is set to the maximum required for the climate.  The
prescriptive standards give SHGC criteria for all orientations and
provide an exception for north facing fenestration.  The exception is
not used for the baseline building; the criteria for all orientations
are used for all orientations??
 
However, even the LEED-NC EAc1 template differentiates between the
North SHGC and the rest of the fenestration?.if the exception is not to
be used, why would the USGBC have a place to enter the SHGC(north) for
the baseline building??  And why would they accept two different SHGCs
for the baseline building on the template?
 
I can?t seem to find any NC or CS CIRs that address this.

Mean monthly outdoor temperature was incorporated in the ASHRAE Standard 55-2004, because this parameter can be found easily from readily available climatic data, such as published by www.ncdc.noaa.gov 

In the ASHRAE RP-884 project, which formed the basis of the adaptive thermal comfort in ASHRAE Standard 55, the outdoor temperature index used was the mean effective temperature (ET*).  ET* combines temperature and humidity into a single index and for RP-884 was calculated based on measured data. It should be noted that RP-884 involved nearly 21,000 sets of raw data compiled from 160 different office buildings located over a broad spectrum of climate zones spread across 4 continents. For more information regarding the relationship between thermal comfort and the environmental index- ET*, please refer to the Thermal Comfort chapter in ASHRAE Handbook of fundamentals. 

As mentioned earlier, the mean monthly outdoor temperature was introduced in the ASHRAE Standard 55, because it is easy to use and can be estimated quickly. The regressions (between the indoor operative temperature and the outdoor temperature index) that were finally incorporated in Figure 5.3 in the ASHRAE Standard 55 were recalculated based on mean monthly outdoor temperature (original index being ET*). 

It is not necessary, that everyone agrees with the adaptive thermal comfort envelope yielded by using the mean monthly outdoor temperature and figure 5.3 of ASHRAE Standard 55-2004. According to one of the voting members of ASHRAE Standard 55 committee, the method was incorporated in the Standard because the majority of the members voted in favor of this method. And as you are all familiar with the public comment procedure of ASHRAE Standards, please do voice your opinions.


To answer the original question by Chris- 


One may purchase the last years weather data for a small fee at NOAA website which provides the mean monthly outdoor temperature or may use a TMY3 weather file to extract the hourly data for the month in question. Calculate the daily max and daily min and then calculate the average of daily max and average of daily min and then calculate the average of these two averages. One may use only the summer months and/or shoulder seasons (depending on the climate) for estimating the adaptive thermal comfort envelope, because that's when one would use natural ventilation for cooling. Once you have the adaptive comfort envelope for the month in question, use the internal operative temperatures during the occupied hours to determine if 80% of those hours are within the upper and the lower limit of allowable indoor operative temperature.


Furthermore, some researchers believe that adaptive thermal comfort is a much complex phenomenon and hence the adaptive comfort envelope be estimated using the running average of the past 30 days to calculate the thermal comfort envelope for a particular day in a month and some simplify that to only past one day. Please refer to the work by McCartney & Nicol (2002), Nicol & Raja (1997) and Humphreys and Nicol (1998).

You are taking the mean of two means, which seems to be getting farther
and farther from actual data.

It also seems to punish some of the climates that are best suited for
natural ventilation, since having cool nights significantly drops the
acceptability limits. I assume they are pushing you to take advantage of
night pre-cooling and thermal mass, but I find it curious that there are
no allowable hours outside of the range. All of the pre-cooling in the
world isn't going to help you keep the temperatures down during that one
string of 90 degree days in the tmy2 file...

There is a small difference between the arithmetic mean of the monthly 
mean max and min and the overall arithmetic mean of 720 hours of weather 
data. Like you say, it's probably a legacy from the old pen and paper
days.
I've heard that some would use occupied period only to calculate the 
mean. However, I can not find any reference in the text of A55 to 
justify this. Being able to average the warmer occupied hours would make 
things a whole lot easier - even the 80% acceptability temperature can 
regularly be lower than the summertime peaks. It's a tough call for 
natural ventilation.

I find it really odd that you don't have permission to use the IES name even
in a somewhat derived form, when other user groups have previously existed
on yahoo, etc.  Is this an IES trademark issue?  

Do they realise how much support time saving they would probably be making
from having a user list like the ones here?  

Surely they would welcome something that reduces their need to provide so
much support and it would offer students that don't get support from them an
alternative route to getting some support.

Mean monthly outdoor temperature was incorporated in the ASHRAE Standard 55-2004, because this parameter can be found easily from readily available climatic data, such as published by www.ncdc.noaa.gov 

In the ASHRAE RP-884 project, which formed the basis of the adaptive thermal comfort in ASHRAE Standard 55, the outdoor temperature index used was the mean effective temperature (ET*).  ET* combines temperature and humidity into a single index and for RP-884 was calculated based on measured data. It should be noted that RP-884 involved nearly 21,000 sets of raw data compiled from 160 different office buildings located over a broad spectrum of climate zones spread across 4 continents. For more information regarding the relationship between thermal comfort and the environmental index- ET*, please refer to the Thermal Comfort chapter in ASHRAE Handbook of fundamentals. 

As mentioned earlier, the mean monthly outdoor temperature was introduced in the ASHRAE Standard 55, because it is easy to use and can be estimated quickly. The regressions (between the indoor operative temperature and the outdoor temperature index) that were finally incorporated in Figure 5.3 in the ASHRAE Standard 55 were recalculated based on mean monthly outdoor temperature (original index being ET*). 

It is not necessary, that everyone agrees with the adaptive thermal comfort envelope yielded by using the mean monthly outdoor temperature and figure 5.3 of ASHRAE Standard 55-2004. According to one of the voting members of ASHRAE Standard 55 committee, the method was incorporated in the Standard because the majority of the members voted in favor of this method. And as you are all familiar with the public comment procedure of ASHRAE Standards, please do voice your opinions.


To answer the original question by Chris- 


One may purchase the last years weather data for a small fee at NOAA website which provides the mean monthly outdoor temperature or may use a TMY3 weather file to extract the hourly data for the month in question.

I am currently building a Baseline Model for system 8 with PFP in IESVE
for compliance with ASHRAE 90.1 2004 Appendix G.  I am not familiar with
the VAV PFP or ASHRAE 90.1 and this is my first attempt to model it.  I
am modeling an office building which has significant glazed facades in
climate zone 4a.  
 
1.    Can anybody tell me does the design air flow rate temperature
difference of 20 F apply for heating as well as cooling?  (G3.1.2.8
2.    If it applies for heating also what happens when the parallel fan
is sized at 50% of the peak design airflow and is insufficient to
provide heating to the space at the temperature difference of 15C, can
the parallel fan airflow rate be increased from 50% to take account for
the additional heating requirement?  (G3.1.3.14)
3.    If the heating loads are larger (and therefore the airflow rates)
then the cooling loads then, do I still size the parallel fan at 50% of
the cooling load or do I size based on 50% of the heating load, or do I
increase this fan volume and the electrical reheat to provide the
required capacity for the larger heating loads?  Or is the primary
airflow increased at elevated temperatures to make up the difference.
 
I am confused so any help on this would be appreciated

An example of sizing Fan Terminal Units (FTU)....
 
 
 
I have a 1000 cfm zone (determined from peak load conditions) to be
served by a FTU, therefore the parallel fan in my box is sized for 500
cfm (50% of peak flow).  Now typically in heating is when the primary
air is going to go to an absolute minimum.  This must be 300 cfm or the
total volume of OSA that I need for the zone, whichever is larger.  In
theory, the fan could provide all 500 cfm of its air when the primary
air is at a minimum if that meets the load.  The fan will typically
always be the first stage of heating.  After that, if setpoint isn't
met, the reheat coil comes on.  I would say that the design condition,
depending on climate of course, will be cooling dominated 7 times out of
10.
 
Also, as a note, the discussion of minimum flow setpoint is an area of
weakness for a VAV system.  If the zone was designed for 1000 cfm in
cooling mode and the minimum outside air was determined to be 300 cfm,
you will almost never reach this value when the VAV is operating at part
load.  There is a good article on this in the January issue of
Engineered Systems magazine.
 
 
 
Hope this helps.

Hi Andrew, that is really helpful.  I missed that section of the code.
 
 
 
Now, a few points that maybe someone could elucidate, maybe even you:
 
 
 
1.)  Does 50% of the peak design flow rate imply that, if, for example,
the min vol setpoint is 30%, then the recirc coming in parallel is 20%?
 
2.)  That makes sense, except I am guessing this CFM value is the 50%
peak design flow rate?  That would only be logical.
 
3.)  This min setpoint is for the primary air.
 
4.)  The design condition they are referring to is the summer design
condition, or the winter design condition or both?  I am guessing it is
both.
 
 
 
 
 
That is a great help, thanks for everything so far.
 
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Chien

Section G3.1.3.14 of Appendix G hit on requirements for fan powered
boxes.  They are:
 
 
 
1.)     FTUs shall be sized for 50% of the peak design flow rate 
 
2.)     FTUs shall be modeled with 0.35 W/cfm fan power.
 
3.)     Minimum volume setpoints for FTUs shall be equal to 30% of the
peak design flow rate or the rate required to meet minimum OSA
ventilation, whichever is larger.
 
4.)     The supply air temperature setpoint shall be constant at the
design condition.
 
 
 
Hope that helps.  Good luck.

Hi there-
 
 
 
I've been tasked with modeling a parallel fan powered box as my baseline
system for ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G, and basically I am wondering if there
is anyone who knows of modeling guidelines for that FPB?  I have the
capability of modeling any sort of conditions I would like, so I can
vary the flow rate of the recirc air, the control sequencing of the
fan-assist, and even whether that fan is variable volume or constant
volume.
 
 
 
I can't find any guidelines that exist anywhere on this topic in ASHRAE
90.1, and this is the first time I've had to model it (I've never
designed an electrically-heated building before).  Does anyone know
whether:
 
 
 
1.)  There is a specific ratio for the amount of recirc air to minimum
primary air?
 
2.)  Whether the amount of recirc air should vary (ie-a variable speed
fan)?
 
3.)  You can just use a real FPB with data from a company like Carrier,
and just call it a day on the simultion effort?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Any guidance would be really helpful.
 
 
 
 
 
Thanks in advance,
 
Chien Harriman

Thank you Gaurav,

I used the average of all (300 or so) hours for each weather month of an 
EPW file. Rationale being:
- The method is comparitive so shouldn't depend too heavily on absolute 
weather data (like we do in the UK)
- Unofficial advice from a technical adviser at ASHRAE confirmed it
- ASHRAE person pointed me to same results on Weather.com with close 
agreement
- I calculated using the "means from means" method and it was within 0.5 
of a degree

 From discussion, a drawback appears to be that certain weather sets and 
regions may unfairly load the result in either direction.

Joe Huang suggested that the original "means from means" method was a 
legacy from the days when weather stations reported daily min and max 
only. Simulation methods have moved on since. When this was put to the 
ASHRAE adviser he recommended that this was put formally to ASHRAE as a 
change request.

I'm intrigued as to where the naming of 80% and 90% limits come from. 
Like you say Gaurav, neither of them refer to 80% or 90% of hours. The 
nomenclature appears to be entirely arbitrary. In light of your 
correction to your first email, it also seems evident that they can be a 
little misleading.

Best regards

Chris Yates

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Condensation in heritage buildings - best practice
Message-ID: <49356E4B.4080703@zed-uk.com>

Hi

I've been looking at the problem of condensation in heritage buildings. 
I'm concluding that - especially in winter - best practice would be to 
mechanically ventilate to a positive pressure (i.e. supply more than 
extract).

My rationale is thus:
- The external air is heated, lowering it's RH.
- The positive pressure ensures this air with a more favourable (drier) 
psychrometric is continually pushed from the inside out.

Doors and windows need to be reasonably well sealed for this to work. 
Obviously, this is no guarantee against condensation build-up. Can 
anybody see any error in my rationale? I would be grateful to hear of 
alternative methods of control that have been successful.

Most commercially available building simulation codes can't model this:
- I'm uncertain as to what E+ can do at present.
- IES-VE can't
- ESP-r can but is very anachronistic (thar be dragons!)

Can any of the 1D Transient FEA packages model this positive ventilation 
scenario? e.g. 1d-HAM, MOIST, WUFI

Best regards

Chris Yates

I'm starting to dread the arrival of the daily digest from this list,
due to the inconsiderate people who neglect to trim their replies before
sending and due to those who outright abuse it, and today's digest
dramatically illustrated both.
First Mr. Nouman Khan sent a one sentence reply to his daily digest
without first erasing off the originating message at the bottom of his
reply, which resulted in 2/3 of today's digest being a repeat of
yesterday's digest (which was also full of repeated originating
messages). I'll assume this was a crime of ignorance, not malice, but
those of you who see yourself in this mistake, please have a care and
take a moment to erase all the garbage off the bottom of your reply
before you hit send (as I've done with this message)!

When I finally scrolled down far enough to locate the second message in
today's digest, I find that it is an advertisement having nothing to do
with building simulation. Is there no moderator for this list who can
block spammers and people who abuse the list? I think one strike of
blatant abuse like this advertisement should ban one from the list, and
maybe three strikes of ignorant, callous mistakes like the one described
above before you are out (with warnings in between). Everyone on this
list is a professional trying to get something done with their day
besides reading e-mail, and hoping to learn more tips about building
simulation, so this list needs to be policed better if it is to stay an
asset and not a liability! If there is no moderator, we need everyone on
the list to self-police their behavior!

This is the second time in the short time I've been a subscriber I've
complained about this, and it is like talking to a brick wall for all
the good it does,
Christina

Chris,

Here's what I see as the problems to the rationale you outlined:

The RH probably isn't the issue; it's the absolute humidity (or
equivalently, the dewpoint).  On a psychrometric chart, heating air moves
the state horizontally to the right; no moisture is removed.  If the air has
a dewpoint of 10?C, for example, heating it won't change the dewpoint.
Generally, if that air comes into contact with a 9?C surface, you will get
condensation regardless of its temperature.  

The outdoor air that you bring in will generally have a dewpoint that's
higher than the coldest envelope component (such as a window), but its
dewpoint will increase inside the building because of latent loads
(breathing, etc.).  So when you pressurize the building, you are actually
forcing moister air out through the cracks, potentially forming condensate
inside the walls.

My guess is that you don't need simulation software to analyze your
situation.  A psychrometric chart and some information about your project
specifics (design outdoor air condition, latent load, u-values, etc.) should
suffice.

I hope this is helpful.

Regards, 
David Yuill

Honestly every since the switch from GARD to onebuilding the digest has
been horrid.  Without the ability to click links to each post you're
forced to sort through the endless string of replies to get to each
message.

However, it is often helpful to see the string of e-mails that lead to
each message being sent.

The solution for you might to be get rid of digest mode and just go to
individual messages.  I gave up on digest shortly after the switch to a
total text based format.

I'm starting to dread the arrival of the daily digest from this list,
due to the inconsiderate people who neglect to trim their replies before
sending and due to those who outright abuse it, and today's digest
dramatically illustrated both.
First Mr. Nouman Khan sent a one sentence reply to his daily digest
without first erasing off the originating message at the bottom of his
reply, which resulted in 2/3 of today's digest being a repeat of
yesterday's digest (which was also full of repeated originating
messages). I'll assume this was a crime of ignorance, not malice, but
those of you who see yourself in this mistake, please have a care and
take a moment to erase all the garbage off the bottom of your reply
before you hit send (as I've done with this message)!

When I finally scrolled down far enough to locate the second message in
today's digest, I find that it is an advertisement having nothing to do
with building simulation. Is there no moderator for this list who can
block spammers and people who abuse the list? I think one strike of
blatant abuse like this advertisement should ban one from the list, and
maybe three strikes of ignorant, callous mistakes like the one described
above before you are out (with warnings in between). Everyone on this
list is a professional trying to get something done with their day
besides reading e-mail, and hoping to learn more tips about building
simulation, so this list needs to be policed better if it is to stay an
asset and not a liability! If there is no moderator, we need everyone on
the list to self-police their behavior!

This is the second time in the short time I've been a subscriber I've
complained about this, and it is like talking to a brick wall for all
the good it does,

Oops.  I've encountered the read-before-you-send problem.  In my third

Chris,

Here's what I see as the problems to the rationale you outlined:

The RH probably isn't the issue; it's the absolute humidity (or
equivalently, the dewpoint).  On a psychrometric chart, heating air moves
the state horizontally to the right; no moisture is removed.  If the air has
a dewpoint of 10?C, for example, heating it won't change the dewpoint.
Generally, if that air comes into contact with a 9?C surface, you will get
condensation regardless of its temperature.  

The outdoor air that you bring in will generally have a dewpoint that's
higher than the coldest envelope component (such as a window), but its
dewpoint will increase inside the building because of latent loads
(breathing, etc.).  So when you pressurize the building, you are actually
forcing moister air out through the cracks, potentially forming condensate
inside the walls.

My guess is that you don't need simulation software to analyze your
situation.  A psychrometric chart and some information about your project
specifics (design outdoor air condition, latent load, u-values, etc.) should
suffice.

I hope this is helpful.

Regards, 
David Yuill

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Condensation in heritage buildings - best practice


Hi

I've been looking at the problem of condensation in heritage buildings. 
I'm concluding that - especially in winter - best practice would be to 
mechanically ventilate to a positive pressure (i.e. supply more than 
extract).

My rationale is thus:
- The external air is heated, lowering it's RH.
- The positive pressure ensures this air with a more favourable (drier) 
psychrometric is continually pushed from the inside out.

Doors and windows need to be reasonably well sealed for this to work. 
Obviously, this is no guarantee against condensation build-up. Can 
anybody see any error in my rationale? I would be grateful to hear of 
alternative methods of control that have been successful.

Most commercially available building simulation codes can't model this:
- I'm uncertain as to what E+ can do at present.
- IES-VE can't
- ESP-r can but is very anachronistic (thar be dragons!)

Can any of the 1D Transient FEA packages model this positive ventilation 
scenario? e.g. 1d-HAM, MOIST, WUFI

Best regards

Chris Yates

Just some thoughts on HVAC basics.  Depending on what can be done with your heritage building....Increased R-value of the exterior walls will move the dew point to within the wall.  Combine this with a vapor barrier - a good coat of paint and sealing to prevent conditioned air from entering the wall cavity - and the temperature of the inside surface of the wall is above the dew point.  Efficient glazing will decrease condensation on the windows, but prepare for the inevitable condensation anyway.  A dedicated dessicant system after the mixed air, assuming an air handling system exists or can be installed, would be another or additional method, and would help prevent condensation within the wall cavity which will happen to some extent regardless of how well your walls are sealed.

Chris, perhaps I can shed some light on this apparition for you. I was a
member of the ASHRAE 55 committee when the adaptive comfort method was
introduced. From data sets with unknown origins a group came up with
statistical evaluation of the results, the mean outdoor temperature. I
see some of the top weather statisticians have already replied and
wonder above wonder when you take the mean temperature, it is somewhat
lower than the design temperature most of us old fogey's are used to
working with. So mysteriously a 32C design temp gets slimmed down to a
26C mean temp and it fits the graph.

When we have to 'cook' the books in this manner we simply take the
monthly outdoor dry bulb temperature and divide this by the number of
hours. Now the next question that isn't explained in 55 is whether or
not the weather data should be taken for only the occupied period or the
whole month ?  The plot thickens. A simple explanation on how to use
this methodology is whether or not the user is liable for the
calculations and designs. Imagine a litigation case, when asking the
engineer 'How did you calculates this?" well I took the mean of the
outdoor temperature and I...................... Case closed.

For the purpose of acceptability limits, can anybody cite any guidance 

on calculating the mean monthly outdoor temperature? I've read ASHRAE 55


and it states: "mean monthly outdoor temperature is the arithmetic 

average of the mean daily minimum and the mean daily maximum outdoor 

(dry bulb) temperature for the month in question."

Thanks

Another option is to think about the DOAS route.  This may lower the cost of
providing dehumidification of the outdoor airstream, if you're trying to
maintain a dewpoint indoors that is lower than the dewpoint outdoors under
some conditions.

Hmm, and combine this with HRV (heat recovery ventilation) - without mixing the air streams - to maximize energy savings.  Protect your building and save energy $.

We generally study these building envelope moisture-control issues with

It is very difficult, even with special vapor barrier construction, to
prevent moisture migration through walls. What we really do is slow it
down. Without mechanical intervention, the outside air dew point in
winter is almost always (I will not say never) below the dew point of
the interior spaces. People sweat and that produces moisture. Typically,
people at normal occupant densities do not cause enough moisture to be
in the space to cause condensation, as long as the building is minimally
ventilated (ASHRAE 62) and insulated. Usually there exists other
external producers of moisture that raise the moisture content of the
air to the point of condensation on typical wall temperatures (showers,
poorly ventilated dryers, leaking pipes, etc) and these combined with
poor insulation or ventilation usually cause the problem. Hence the
issues with heritage type buildings.

Christina,

When we switched to the onebuilding.org web site we switched 
the software we were using for the mailing list to Mailman. 
I have two options for digests "plain" or "MIME". It has 
been set to "plain" but I just switched it to MIME. Please 
let me know if that is any better.

Everyone should read the list guidelines prior to posting

   http://onebuilding.org/guidelines.html

I tried to keep them simple.

If the members of the list would like me to add some text 
about trimming replies, I can. Keep in mind that most people 
don't use the digest mode and the reply text helps 
understand the context of a message. Maybe people who 
receive digests should trim their reply .. and answer using 
the original subject.

I should also point out that the DOAS is also applicable in cases where
you're after a dewpoint that is above the outdoor dewpoint.  I may have left
a different impression in an earlier message.  It can be much cheaper to
dehumidify a portion of the airstream that is already near saturation than
to dehumidify mixed air.

Moisture in and through construction materials can become a huge problem
(definitely lawsuit class) if the issue is not addressed in a wholistic
fashion.  My background is HVAC, not architecture, but I'm know that even a
"good" HVAC system cannot overcome a poor envelope retrofit.  
 
There is an emerging discussion about this topic in the HVAC world; I
recommend looking at past issue of the ASHRAE Journal in the "Building
Sciences" column, written by Joe Lstiburek.  I think he's got an excellent
grasp of the physics and is also very practical.

EQuest is okay for this, the Carrier HAP ( hourly analysis program) and
Trane Trace 700 would also suffice. In my opinion  the Carrier HAP
required input data forms are some what simpler than the Tran Trace,
however the Trane Trace has more system templates and associated system
graphics associated with each template, so you can just about model
anything ( ice storage, cogen, vav with reheat, vav with perimeter

Since I live in a "heritage building" (100+ year old balloon-framed
house that began as the bunk-house for hired hands and hasn't gained
much insulation since), and I've worked in historic preservation firms
for years, I think a lot on this subject. 

Everyone who replied to this subject was mostly right on target, but I
want to add my two cents in re-iterating the cautions in doing poorly
conceived energy retrofits to leaky old buildings without understanding
the building science and how it applies to the particular building. One
should at least figure out where the dewpoint falls in the wall in the
existing structure as well as the proposed retrofit, where the biggest
air leaks are in the building envelope (an infrared camera used during a
blower-door test makes this very graphic), and how one is going to
retard the passage of moist air into the portion of the building
envelope that is near or below dewpoint, and how you will encourage all
portions of the building envelope to dry to either the interior or
exterior faster than they are exposed to moisture. If one does a
haphazard job of tightening the structure and adding insulation, one can
easily cause a century old building that was in decent structural
condition to rot away in less than a decade, and/or make its occupants
deathly ill when you concentrate the humidity escaping into a few
locations and even increase the temperature in the building envelope to
the perfect conditions for micro-organisms to proliferate.

This "heritage" building I'm in (like most such) is a working holistic
building/energy system when operated as originally designed. It is
extremely drafty in winter, so the moisture we generate by breathing,
showering, cooking, etc diffuses right out through the envelope. Yes, it
probably condenses on surfaces within the walls as it does on interior
window panes, but there is so much air movement through the envelope
that it dries out again almost immediately, plus it is probably too cold
in the walls for mold and rot to grow. Part of what made this house (and
many other buildings of its vintage) last so long is that the standards
of human comfort were much lower when it was built. Typically only one
room on the ground floor was heated (with wood) as we are doing now (the
unheated rooms surrounding the heated one reduce heat loss and prevent
ice damming), and humidity levels in winter were very low, due to high
air leakage and a dry heat source (and people bathed infrequently
instead of showering daily). If all future occupants could be content
with cocooning near the woodstove and could deal with the nose bleeds
from dry air as we do, this building could probably last another century
and use relatively little energy to get through winter, but that is
unlikely in the extreme. 

Consequently, though I preach energy efficiency at every turn, I've not
done anything to the "heritage" building I live in yet, mostly due to
other unrelated changes in its environment that now make the home an
undesireable place to live. But even if this home was desireable to
salvage, I'd wait until I had sufficient funds to retrofit the whole
building with a super-efficient retrofit such as one that would meet or
at least approach the Passive House Standard (see www.passivehouse.us
&www.passivehouse.com), else I could easily make things worse instead of
better. From all of my study and research, I've come to the conclusion
that unless one is prevented by historic preservation restrictions, the
safest/ best energy retrofit to old buildings is to wrap them on the the
exterior with a new air barrier which must be carefully sealed to the
highest performance windows and doors available (preferably ones that
can meet the Passive House certification standards) to create a very
tight continuous air barrier, which must then be wrapped with a
continuous superinsulation layer on the exterior of the air barrier. The
cheapest solution is typically to decide that basement and crawlspaces
are outside the conditioned space (air barrier on underside of original
joists, with superinsulation below that), and move all mechanicals and
plumbing into the conditioned space if possible, superinsulating
plumbing/ mechanical runs that can't be moved inside the insulated
envelope. One can deal with insulating basements and slab on grade
construction, but it is much more challenging and costly to do it well. 

I say it is safest to energy retrofit on the exterior because one can
often attempt to replicate the original facades on the new exteriors
easier than one can succeed in creating a tight air barrier on the
inside of the insulation layers if one is limited to retrofitting on the
inside of the building. But if you are forced to retrofit from the
inside, you'd better check for concentrated air leaks thoroughly with
infrared camera and blower door test until you get a VERY tight
building, and calculate the temperature at that air barrier to ensure
that it is above the dewpoint. The Passive House Institute has
demonstrated that even if you are forced to create the air barrier and
to superinsulate on the inside (this inevitably results in more air
leaks and lots of thermal bridging), superinsulating to the Passive
House Standard typically prevents condensation on the interior surfaces
of thermal bridges because it attenuates the path of heat loss which
typically raises the interior surface temperature of the thermal bridge
to above the dewpoint. But retrofitting to the Passive House Standard
often costs as much as building new, and needs to be done in one
building season - incremental "improvements" can be worse than doing
nothing, as I described above.

Best wishes if you are trying to salvage existing buildings, and keep
your professional insurance up to date,
Christina

EQuest is okay for this, the Carrier HAP ( hourly analysis program) and
Trane Trace 700 would also suffice. In my opinion  the Carrier HAP
required input data forms are some what simpler than the Tran Trace,
however the Trane Trace has more system templates and associated system
graphics associated with each template, so you can just about model
anything ( ice storage, cogen, vav with reheat, vav with perimeter
radiation, etc, etc,) I prefer the Trane Trace for high rise commercial
buildings and the  Carrier HAP for smaller 4 to 5 Multi family type

I am wondering if any can provide me with some insight on LEED Energy
Modeling to obtain EAc1 with LEED NC2.2. I am specifically attempting to
determine which program I will use to model baseline vs. design. I am
proficient in EnergyPro, however it seems many people prefer to use
eQuest. I have also heard some good things about the HAP program from
Carrier. Any thoughts or suggestions? 

 

Our typical project types consist of new 4 or 5 story multi-family
apartments. It should also be noted that almost all of our work is
within California. 


Thanks.

Dear all:

I have to convert 9 hours measured data to epw, i tried to use METEONORM, but in
the Hourly import step alltime conclude in error message "error in file read"

Is it a DAT format error, could be!!

And is it accepted by DesignBuilder to have that 9 hours epw file regardless
that METEONORM can generate such a file!!

A giudance with that will be appreciated.

Best regards,

Message-ID: <5F662BF0C1928242BF324F3EE6C27D141FE431@exc01sfo1us.FKUSA.ORG>

 
Dear Bldg Sim
 
I have a big box warehouse project that is primarily unconditioned with
the exception of some conditioned areas along the north and south
perimeters.  I have 2 concerns, pertaining to LEED EAc1 (NC2.2):
 
1.  The warehouse is currently existing but with no conditioned spaces.
The envelope is being completely revamped and conditioned spaces are
being added.  The overall footprint is also changing slightly.
According to Ashrae 90.1-2004,Table G3.1, paragraph 5F, "For existing
building envelopes, the baseline building design shall reflect existing
conditions prior to any revisions that are part of the scope of work
being evaluated."  Does this mean that the 40% WWR and Building Envelope
requirements from Tables 5.5 do not apply?  How do I approach the
section of the existing building that is being knocked down?  
 
2.  In my Proposed model: How should I model the interior walls
separating the conditioned space from the unconditioned space?  My
problem with modeling 8" CMUs is that I come up with a large number of
loads not met due to the loads and solar heat gain from the
unconditioned area.  Would it be kosher to model the interior walls as
adiabatic in both the baseline and proposed models?
 
Any insight or experiences with this would be greatly appreciated.
 
Thank you!

The weather converter from EnergyPlus might be able to be used but 9 
hours is probably not acceptable to run DB or EnergyPlus.

need at least 24 hours.  (Which of course, you could make up once you 
have the basic file).

The CSV format that the EnergyPlus weather program allows you to use 
would allow you to hand edit the data to the desired number of hours.

Message-ID: <3C47478A1995BF40895EC7AA3B876BC60290D6@EX007.RMI.local>

Bldg-Sim,

                I am modeling a laboratory with several large walk-in
coolers and freezers. I am interested to hear anyone's opinion on this
modeling strategy as I have found very little guidance in the
literature.

I am not using the refrigeration version of eQUEST. I am using the
built-in refrigeration tab. I understand, from the help file, that this
model assumes a refrigerated case rather than a walk-in. A schedule was
assigned for the cover with a value of 0 for all hours to represent a
closed case. A dummy value is entered in the Zone load to enable
refrigeration (I believe that this value is negated by the cover) and
the case temperature is specified.

                I then made sure that all the walls in each of the
refrigerated zones is adiabatic including the external walls
(effectively by creating a construction with a zero U-val). I am now
specifying the actual heat rejection of the equipment (from the
designer) in the plenum (where it is actually being rejected). The heat
will be divided between each plenum space weighted by area to simulate
an open return plenum.

 

Any advice or comments are greatly appreciated!

 

Thx

Eric,

 

Have you considered using the waste heat from the coolers to heat water
for other uses?

 

In any case this company makes several interesting products that use
waste heat from A/C or refrigeration systems to provide free domestic
hot water.

 

The Enviro-Pak is for residential or small commercial use.  The
Enviro-temp is for larger scale applications.

Moisture in and through construction materials can become a huge problem
(definitely lawsuit class) if the issue is not addressed in a wholistic
fashion.  My background is HVAC, not architecture, but I'm know that even a
"good" HVAC system cannot overcome a poor envelope retrofit.  

 

There is an emerging discussion about this topic in the HVAC world; I
recommend looking at past issue of the ASHRAE Journal in the "Building
Sciences" column, written by Joe Lstiburek.  I think he's got an excellent
grasp of the physics and is also very practical.

Hey All,

I am running a baseline simulation in eQUEST. I have created a
parametric run in which it will simulated the four different azimuth
angles as required by Appendix G. I was curious if the north SHGC can
rotate with the building. If not, I believe I would have to create four
separate files for the four orientation to keep the north SHGC in the
correct direction for the four separate models.

 

Thanks, 

 

Janne

My answer to the same question posed to this list on Monday was:
"I read Table G3.1 section 5 sub item (c) under the baseline building performance column to require use of the 'SHGC_all' for all vertical glazing."

I still think that answer is technically right for 90.1-2004 Appendix G.

Others raised nuanced points that might apply if your question is really about LEED-NC v2.2 EAc1 and/or 90.1-2007.

In case they do not each respond again, you may wish to check our list archive at http://lists.onebuilding.org/pipermail/bldg-sim-onebuilding.org/

Subject: ASHRAE Mn Chapter eXchanger 12-04-2008 LAST CHANCE REMINDER FOR NEXT WEEKS SEMINAR

Today is the deadline for registering for the December 9th Sustainability Seminar, "Energy Modeling, Before and After. "

We have a full program this year-six speakers presenting plus a panel discussion.  And a timely topic: How to get the most energy savings in building operations by using energy modeling before you finish the design and after the building is occupied, by verifying and adjusting your models with actual measurements of energy consumption.

Both an organic breakfast and organic lunch are included in the seminar price as well as vendors sharing information on their energy modeling products.

On line registration is quick and easy at the MN ASHRAE website: www.mnashrae.org<http://console.mxlogic.com/redir/?6VJdZZWXPPxI04H3q4UX_00jt-LtdZ5VUQsEK6XCXhSh7x6Fe5aM1h3U4ZlVsSe79I3zqaqrP5PhOMy-rupdy0M5Mm83hEw6U6y0i9WJfUCy3M6IjS17UCy15cLtwKDuXNEwd40l41w4Cy0i2Uw318qd40b6xId1wsd0IQg2Uo1pEw1wQ0M9d402zgQ1gMq81wq6MQ620bdPYfDwedECQjqrXXRTDDztgJrizpD>.

Message-ID: <55BA83825A482144A8637F9CAA981F7611FFEFC5@las-mail.lordaecksargent.internal>

I'm wrestling with an energy model for a lab building and have a quick question about fumehood exhaust. 

ASHRAE 90.1 says the following about fume hood exhaust

6.5.7.2 Fume Hoods. Buildings with fume hood systems
having a total exhaust rate greater than 15,000 cfm shall
include at least one of the following features:
(a) Variable air volume hood exhaust and room supply systems
capable of reducing exhaust and makeup air volume
to 50% or less of design values.
(b) Direct makeup (auxiliary) air supply equal to at least 75%
of the exhaust rate, heated no warmer than 2?F below
room setpoint, cooled to no cooler than 3?F above room
setpoint, no humidification added, and no simultaneous
heating and cooling used for dehumidification control.
(c) Heat recovery systems to precondition makeup air from
fume hood exhaust in accordance with 6.5.6.1 (Exhaust
Air Energy Recovery) without using any exception.

 
My question is this:

If the lab is equipped with snorkels, does this count towards this calculation, or is this strictly for fumehoods? (My guess is the term "fume hood systems" includes snorkels. 

My other question is this:

We are currently doing heat recovery (so we have criterion (c) covered).  If we are using constant volume hoods with off peak hour setback, can we take credit for that, or do we need to reflect that in both the base model and the designed building? In reality since this is a teaching lab the hoods will be open most of the time, and the difference in performance with a VAV fumehood and a CAV hood with setback would be nonexistent.

My take is that you need to model the base using item c. That is heat recovery with thew fume. Hood exhaust as per 6.5.6.1. 

If your new building will have constant volume hoods, with 5O percent set back during unoccupied periods, thanb that is what you have to model. See if you can drop thje set back to 30 to 40 percent(provided the min air changes for the lab is maintained during the unoccupied hrs.

If the snorkels are on, then you should include them

Is it possible to view the CA utility rates in the library?  They can be used as templates to create other rates.  Attached are results I obtained when I tried modeling GSHP and PV.

e+ at least I'll give some slack for releasing this month.  I would be willing to use the current package expecting it the software to be approved as soon as the documentation can be submitted.

For the others you are right, it would be nice to get an update of intentions if anyone on the list is out there developing these tools.

I work on the EnergyGauge Summit development team. We are currently 
making some changes to our code compliance engine that develops the 
ASHRAE reference building automatically.

When this is implemented and the new version is released in January 
2009, we will send in the documentation to DOE to get that latest 
version certified.

DesignBuilder expects the full 8760 hourly records and it won't work
without. However, you could use your special 7 records to overwrite the
equivalent dates in a full years hourly weather data file for the same
location and it should work OK in DB and E+

  The weather converter from EnergyPlus might be able to be used but 9 hours
is probably not acceptable to run DB or EnergyPlus.

  need at least 24 hours.  (Which of course, you could make up once you have
the basic file).

  The CSV format that the EnergyPlus weather program allows you to use would
allow you to hand edit the data to the desired number of hours.

The best way to do this is to perform a CFD model of the system that
includes all applicable parameters, the out put is a graffic display of
the temp and smoke profiles. The available software is based on a 3D
model.

Hi all-
 
Sort of technical question here that requires some knowledge of the inner workings of either EnergyPlus or DOE2/eQuest...hoping there is someone out there who knows the answers to this.  What does either an EnergyPlus or DOE2 user have to do when dealing with different units, particularly when it comes to the curve fits?  Obviously, the same coefficients do not apply for both units.  Do the default curve coefficients for the chiller, for example, have both IP and metric equivalents?  
 
Does anyone know how this works?  Has anyone bumped into a regression model that can take raw data in metric units, and create a set of coefficients in one set of units (let's say IP for starters), and then use those newly-created coefficients, generate an new set of raw data, and then create a new regression to produce a new set of coefficients in converted units (Metric, in this case?)  
 
Has either DOE2 or EnergyPlus already solved this problem, and I don't need to even think about itanymore?
 
Thanks,

Not really. Some curves are the function of temperature and/or other variables with dimension. Although the results of the performance curves are usually dimensionless, the coefficients of the curves depends on the unit of the variables.

Dan,

 

I think I misspoke in my reply below.

 

I believe the standard version of eQUEST/DOE-2 allows you to input curve fit
DATA using either English or metric; if metric independent temperatures are
used, the Building Design Language processor should convert the metric
temperatures to English before doing the curve fit.  The coefficients
generated would then expect hourly temperature in English.  However, if you
do a curve fit independently of BDL using metric temperatures, and simply
give the program the COEFFICIENTS rather than the DATA, then the curve would
expect metric temperatures, and the hourly curve algorithm would feed it
English; resulting in a severe error.

 

So, as long as you generate the curve using BDL, I believe you can use
either English or metric units.  It should be easy enough to test to
confirm. Just input the same curve with both English and metric temperatures
(specifying METRIC input), and see if you get the same coefficients. If this
is not the case, please let me know.

 

The refrigeration version of the program has a curve-fit routine that allows
either English or metric curve coefficients to be used; there is a keyword
that allows you to specify which values you are using.  So the library could
have curves of both types in it.  On an hourly basis, if the curve is
metric, the program converts the input temperatures from English to metric,
feeds them into the curve, and converts the output from metric back to
English (if the output has dimensional units).  Hopefully, we will port that
algorithm over to the standard version in the future.

 

Steve

Chien Si, others,

The problem is more complicated than what you're asking, because EnergyPlus and DOE-2 do not necessarily express their curves using the same equation formulation. When I worked a few years back in translating DOE-2 inputs to EnergyPlus, I  (or others in the then LBNL team!) had to  reformulate many of the equations and coefficients, and in some cases, redo the curve fit from scratch.  As several people have already pointed out, even if the equation is the same, the coefficients are unit-specific and hence differ between IP and SI.

Hi All,

I've seen a bunch of questions on the list-serve about creating custom
weather files, but never figured out how to do it myself.

I've been able to create a custom CSV file (and then removed all commas), so
I should now have a custom TMY file.  How do I get it into BIN format so
eQuest can read it?  I downloaded the conversion files from DOE2 (
http://doe2.com/index_Wth.html), but can't get them to work so far.  Does
anyone have a more complete description of how to make them work?  Also, I
am running Vista... not sure if this is a problem as the conversion programs
are DOS based.

Thanks,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Converting TMY, BIN and CSV files

 

Hi All,

I've seen a bunch of questions on the list-serve about creating custom
weather files, but never figured out how to do it myself.

I've been able to create a custom CSV file (and then removed all
commas), so I should now have a custom TMY file.  How do I get it into
BIN format so eQuest can read it?  I downloaded the conversion files
from DOE2 (http://doe2.com/index_Wth.html), but can't get them to work
so far.  Does anyone have a more complete description of how to make
them work?  Also, I am running Vista... not sure if this is a problem as
the conversion programs are DOS based.

Thanks,

--
Karen

Hi Scott,

Thanks for your response.  I tried your method (on both Vista and XP
machines), and the files are created, but the NEWTH.TMP file has no info in
it (0KB) any thoughts?

Thanks again,

Karen,

 

I believe a file called OUTPUT (or something like that) is created in
the EXENT directory and displays errors found while parsing the TMY2.
Also, perhaps you can double-check that you have a valid TMY2 file. For
example, you could try using the EnergyPlus weather converter to see if
it can successfully convert the TMY2 to an EPW weather file, or you
could try driving a simulation program that uses TMY2 files directly.

 

I should also point out that the 3rd line in the INPUT.TMP file should
have two spaces after the "TMY2" label - this has been a source of
confusion in the past.

 

Scott

... etc.  The file I'm trying to convert is simply the downloaded version
from the nrel website.  I can get my weather data into this sort of text
format, so I just need to be able to get it back to bin!!!

However, I keep getting the following error:

--- ERROR --- END OF FILE READ.  TAPE TYPE TMY2

Some solutions others have suggested that have not worked so far...

1.  Try using energy plus to convert the file to an energy plus format, just
to make sure that the source file is valid--Energy Plus had no problem with
the file

2.  Is the INPUT.TM2 text in exactly the right format (correct number of
spaces and station ID numbers)--Yes, this is exactly as demonstrated here (
http://lists.onebuilding.org/pipermail/bldg-sim-onebuilding.org/2008-May/007524.html),
with two spaces between the "TMY2" and station ID on line 3, and a 5-digit
station ID which matches the WEATHER.TMP file.

3.  When the files are saved as TMP files, are they WEATHER.TMP.TXT and
INPUT.TMP.TXT, or are they truly TMP files--They are truly TMP files.  In
the explorer, under "TYPE" they are identified as TMP files.

Thanks everyone for your suggestions please let me know if you have any
others.

Hi Joe,
 
Could you please shed more light on this topic? --
 
Assuming the performance equations are the same in DOE2 and EnergyPlus. If I just wanted to convert the curve coefficients from IP units to SI units (for example, the chiller capacity performance curve (function of chilled water supply temperature and entering condenser water temperature, of type Bi-quadratic-T in DOE2), do I have to derive the unit conversion formula for the curve coefficients manually, based on the curve type and the unit conversion rule for temperature? As the curve coefficients in this case can not be converted independently.
 
I tried to derive the units conversion formula for one particular curve type before, and got the same results as those in the EnergyPlus library. But I am wondering if there is any more systemmatic way of converting the coefficients between SI and IP, so that the conversion work could be done in an automatic way. As you are one of the developers of EnergyPlus, I believe you are the right person to ask this question.Thanks,Dongyi

Chien Si, others,
 
The problem is more complicated than what you're asking, because EnergyPlus and DOE-2 do not necessarily express their curves using the same equation formulation. When I worked a few years back in translating DOE-2 inputs to EnergyPlus, I  (or others in the then LBNL team!) had to  reformulate many of the equations and coefficients, and in some cases, redo the curve fit from scratch.  As several people have already pointed out, even if the equation is the same, the coefficients are unit-specific and hence differ between IP and SI.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] chiller performance curves?

Hi all-
 
Sort of technical question here that requires some knowledge of the inner workings of either EnergyPlus or DOE2/eQuest...hoping there is someone out there who knows the answers to this.  What does either an EnergyPlus or DOE2 user have to do when dealing with different units, particularly when it comes to the curve fits?  Obviously, the same coefficients do not apply for both units.  Do the default curve coefficients for the chiller, for example, have both IP and metric equivalents?  
 
Does anyone know how this works?  Has anyone bumped into a regression model that can take raw data in metric units, and create a set of coefficients in one set of units (let's say IP for starters), and then use those newly-created coefficients, generate an new set of raw data, and then create a new regression to produce a new set of coefficients in converted units (Metric, in this case?)  
 
Has either DOE2 or EnergyPlus already solved this problem, and I don't need to even think about itanymore?
 
Thanks,

Many thanks Andy for your concern and for all colleagues in this issue

But would you please describe in brief steps of reading a new weather file
rather than that automatically loaded. I did like what you said in the EP+ dat
file produced from METEONORM to add my new records, but how to read this in
DB? 
Moreover, when trying to convert the modified dat file using the DB conversion
tool it gave me an error saying "Error processing the hourly weather file
possibly caused by a format error"  !!

Best regards,
Mohamad.

I'm working on a project that has a water-to-water heat pump (to use chiller
return water to preheat reheat water). Does anyone know if the EER is
regulated by any of the systems listed in the 6.8.1 tables in 90.1? Or is it
unregulated?

Thanks,

I am modeling central AHUs w/chilled water cooling coils and hot water
reheat at the zone level.
I can export hourly data from the system reports for the return air
temperature, entering coil temp, leaving coil temp, etc. BUT I was
wondering if there is a way that I can verify the supply air temp after
the reheat coil?
 
When I export the Zone Unit-Supply temp form the variable type: Thermal

why we can not get the supply temperature after the reheat coil? I
appreciate any input. Thanks!

Michelle,

I've had the same problem in trying to get the supply air temp after the reheat coil in eQUEST.  As far as I can tell, it can't be done.  I believe the reason why you are getting zeroes with the Zone Unit-Supply Temp under the Thermal Zone is due to the fact that the system type you have selected doesn't have a "Zone Unit".  Even though there are reheat coils in the zone, it doesn't classify that as an unit, which makes sense considering you have a central AHU.  Other system types have "Zone Units", like unit heater, fan coil, etc.

Sorry I couldn't help, maybe someone out there knows a way of getting supply air temp after reheat?

Hi Ross,

 

I haven't been checking up on my bldg-sim correspondence for months, but
haven't seen a response to your query.

 

For what it's worth (at this late hour), you can try the School of
Architecture at Wellington University, Wellington N.Z.  In a short stint
there a long time ago they mentioned having weather files for some Pacific
Islands, so they might also have data for Christ Church.

Hi All,

 

Does anyone has access to any weather files for Christchurch New Zealand?

 

Ideally we are looking for a TRY file and a Synth file both in .wfl format.

 

Thanks in advance!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Perimeter Zones, DOE2.1 & DOE2.2
Message-ID: <e0fbd3daf2e.f2ee0fbd3da@iit.edu>

I assume that the 15 ft perimeter zone depth used in energy analysis is so that the interior heat gains do not cancel out the envelope heat losses in winter (when it is say -40 outside).  Design loads programs are not affected since interior heat gains are not deducted from the heat losses.  Office Building Envelopes are being designed to have up to 90% glass.  The glass can be from the bottom of the floor slab to the underside of the next floor slab.  The ceiling depth next to the glass is zero and it slopes down to about 3 feet 2 to 5 feet away from the glass.  Day-lighting can now reach 25 ft away from the glass.  Also, when you turn the day-lighting option on, the lighting load goes down and the heating load goes up.
Can energy analysis programs have perimeter zone depths of up to 25 ft or equal to the depth of the actual perimeter space (rarely will it be less than 10 ft and could go up to the core zone) for day-lighting and set another zone depth of 2 to 5 ft for heating? 
In DOE2.1E I used the following to define the Utility Type for district steam specified per 1000 lbs & CHW per Ton-Hour. 
  
ENERGY-RESOURCE                             $ EST = 220, LST = 210, 975 btu/lb $ 
   RESOURCE = DISTRICT-STEAM  UNIT-NAME = K-LBS/HR     DEM-UNIT-NAME = K-LBS/ 
   SOURCE-SITE-EFF = .60      ENERGY/UNIT = 975000   .. 
  
ENERGY-RESOURCE 
   RESOURCE = DISTRICT-CHW    UNIT-NAME = TONS    DEM-UNIT-NAME = TON-HRS 
   SOURCE-SITE-EFF = .90      ENERGY/UNIT = 12000     .. 
  
In DOE2.2 it is UNIT-INDEX and DEM-UNIT-INDEX and the defaults are 50 and 34 for both.  In eQUEST they are called "Energy Billing Units Label" and "Demand Billing Units Label".  How do I specify the Units since the Utility Rate Units in different parts of the US and world vary? 
DOE2.2 does not appear to have the DOE2.1E Commands and Keywords for SPACE-CONDITIONS, ZONE-CONTROL and SYSTEM-CONTROL.  I have used this in DOE2.1E to set up ?Design Criteria? for different types of Spaces (based on building room types), types of Zones (terminal boxes, etc) and types of Systems (VAVS, PIU, WLHP ? starting with that shown in the DOE2.1E BDL Summary).  Templates of this type of information can be transferred from one project to another and edited for the project.  It is similar to the TRACE700 Project Library. DOE2.2 has SET-DEFAULT that allows master data for one room, zone and system type.
It is possible that I do not understand the DOE2.2 and eQUEST programs well enough and I have missed something.  The 6 DOE2.2 Manuals could do with more examples showing the BDL for modeling PV, GSHP, TES, Load Management, etc.  Case studies would show the full picture.

All,

I tried to export hourly report of diffuse horizontal solar radiation
(from weather data). The whole column is zero. I found this problem
with Singapore weather file, but then I tried it again with Seattle
weather file, same result.

I just hope that this is only a problem from the reporting side of the code.

Message-ID: <FB.0B.26658.99572494@gwout2>

I am an Architect doing the energy model for a number of two story schools
over 85,000 SF, and using eQuest for LEED  energy design and documentation.

 

I am doing the energy model for LEED compliance and I am modeling the base
case with a Packaged Rooftop Variable Air Volume System to compare with my
VAV system for the design case.  I reverse engineered my design case to
modify the mechanical system, but all of  the simulations indicate I have
15,000 hours outside of the throttle range.  My hotwater loop has two
boilers and my heating coils are assigned to the loop, but there does not
seem to be any output from the system.  The system report summary indicates
that it is not serving any square footage, so I think there is a bug
somewhere. I have fiddled with the THROTTLE RANGE, HEAT-CONTROL,
COOL-CONTROL, HEAT-SET-T,  and MIN-SUPPLY-T after reading various posts but
nothing changes the lack of heat.  I've also fiddled with baseboard heat and
pre-heat but nothing seems to affect the hours outside of throttle range.
Does anyone have any suggestions?

Did you try looking at the hourly reports for the equipment that should be
generating the loads?  If the AHUs and zone coils are calling for heat but
it isn't being supplied, then it could be a problem with the hydronic system
inputs.  If there is not a load on the coils, then the problem may lie in
the airside system inputs.  This is typically where I start when I have this
problem.  I have had this happen when I have unconditioned zones being
served by a system intended to serve conditioned zones.  If I have any
unconditioned zones, I put them under a ghost single-zone system that only
serves unconditioned zones (uses no fan power, cooling, etc).

 

I hope this helps!

I know this report can be generated using DOE 2.2 but I figured since eQuest is based on DOE engine.. I might be able to generate the same report in eQuest as well.

Do you have a value entered at the system level for Reheat Delta T?
This is a pretty easy one to miss that will prevent your system from
having any reheat and can result in very high hours out of range.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] PVAVS System In Equest - 15,000 hours out side of
throttle range

 

I am an Architect doing the energy model for a number of two story
schools over 85,000 SF, and using eQuest for LEED  energy design and
documentation.

 

I am doing the energy model for LEED compliance and I am modeling the
base case with a Packaged Rooftop Variable Air Volume System to compare
with my VAV system for the design case.  I reverse engineered my design
case to modify the mechanical system, but all of  the simulations
indicate I have 15,000 hours outside of the throttle range.  My hotwater
loop has two boilers and my heating coils are assigned to the loop, but
there does not seem to be any output from the system.  The system report
summary indicates that it is not serving any square footage, so I think
there is a bug somewhere. I have fiddled with the THROTTLE RANGE,
HEAT-CONTROL, COOL-CONTROL, HEAT-SET-T,  and MIN-SUPPLY-T after reading
various posts but nothing changes the lack of heat.  I've also fiddled
with baseboard heat and  pre-heat but nothing seems to affect the hours
outside of throttle range.  Does anyone have any suggestions?

I believe that was the problem, I had left it blank assuming it would go to
a default value.  Thank you, I wish I would have figured that out a few days
ago.

Thank you for the prompt reply, I found the reports.
I have a question regarding two peak load components in the LS-C report (highlighted below). Shouldn't window glass solar already be accounted for in window glass+ frm cond? If not, then what is  window glass+ frm cond  referring to - I understand the conduction part of it but what is window glass ?

All,
Can anybody shed some light on how I can generate the Building Peak Load Components report in eQuest? Is there a way to specify which reports you'd like to see at the end of the simulation? I know this report can be generated using DOE 2.2 but I figured since eQuest is based on DOE engine.. I might be able to generate the same report in eQuest as well.

Any input is highly appreciated,
Thanks,
Pallavi

There are two places I have been able to find reporting on diffuse
radiation in eQuest using California TMY2 weather files.  The first is
"Surface diffuse solar rad, after shading (Btu/hr-ft2)" which is
reported under Variable Type - Exterior Wall, the other is "Clear day
diffuse horiz solar rad x CLDCOV (Btu/hr-ft2)" reported under Variable
Type - Global.  Other diffuse radiation reporting variables do not
appear to be populated.

Message-ID: <B5E1397BF6CFFD4D8352E2324AB9C2ED02BC5B7B@CD1001-M210.corp.ads>

Hi All, 
I was wondering if any one could share their thoughts on the modeling approach in equest for the following HVAC system . 
A typical unit, at the zone level there is a 4 pipe FC unit with chilled water from a Air Cooled Scroll Chiller and hot water coming for a heat exchanger. the heat exchanger it self is getting it hot water from a central geothermal plant . there is no boiler in this system. 
here are couple of approaches I tried. 
Approach 1: Demand side--model a Water loop HP with lake/well as source and connect the loop to hot water coils (without the boiler), and for cooling, to represent a scroll chiller, model a Screw chiller and connect that to a CHW loop which finally connects to the cooling coils. Supply side-- 4 pipe fan coil unit. 
Although what I just described represents closely to my actual system, I could not do it with out boiler on the demand side, moreover I had other loop connection errors both on the demand side and supply side. 
Approach 2: Demand side--Model a HW boiler connect to a hot water loop and a Screw chiller connected to a chilled water loop , Supply side--- 4 Pipe FC unit. tweak the boiler parameters to fake a geothermal system in terms of loop temp and efficiency, which would be 100% . and put the boiler on a separate meter to deduct the boiler energy use(kw) in the end from the total annual energy use. 
To a certain extent  I am convinced that approach 2 would work. but I wanted to throw these ideas on the table to hear your comments and any new ways to model this above discussed HAVC system. 
Thank you for your time and valuable suggestion.

Hi Ross,

 

I haven't been checking up on my bldg-sim correspondence for months, but
haven't seen a response to your query.

 

For what it's worth (at this late hour), you can try the School of
Architecture at Wellington University, Wellington N.Z.  In a short stint
there a long time ago they mentioned having weather files for some Pacific
Islands, so they might also have data for Christ Church.

You are correct - but the files we created back in 1993 have recently been superseded. So, Ross: the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority funded a project to create a new dataset with much improved solar data - and many more climates than we had 15 years ago.  I believe that they are now available for download from the Energy+ resource web site.  They are certainly referenced here: http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/weatherdata_sources.cfm

Is HAP v4.4 capable of making several parametric runs to evaluate different energy conversation measures at once?  Will different conversation measures need to be configured in an entirely different file?  Thanks.

Kevin,
 
Yes.  HAP v4.4 can make parametric runs to compare energy conservation
measures.  Results can be compared side by side in on reports.  You can
place the conservation measures in a single project -- in fact if you
want to compare them side by side in the same report the ECM runs need
to be part of the same project.
 
Since your firm is a licensed HAP software user you're entitled to free,
unlimited software technical support via 800-253-1794 and
software.systems at carrier.utc.com.  Tech support can help you with the
details of setting up your ECM comparisons you'd like assistance.

Dear all,
 
I'm trying to model a 2-pipe fancoil system (cooling only) in eQuest 3.6
but cannot seem to find a suitable system description using the design
deveopment wizard. There is documentation on the eQuest 3 overview which
states that a system with CHW coils and no heating (2-pipe fancoil
cooling only) can be modelled with eQuest. Does anyone know why this
functionality is not in eQuest3.6, or indeed, how I go about modelling
this type of system?
 
Many thanks in advance,
 
Dan.

Dan,

You cannot define that type of system until you get out of the design
wizard.  Once you finish the wizard, you have to go into detailed mode,
choose the system type "fan coil." Pick the appropriate chw loop and
under heating source, pick not installed.

Dear all,

Has anyone tried assigning analysis grid to multiple surfaces with different
orientations/tilt angles (roofs and walls) at once to do the incident solar
radiation calculation in Ecotect? I have not been able to do it well in my
first few attempts. I've noticed that a single surface with analysis grid
assigned works fine.

Ramana,

The way I do multiple surfaces simulation is to subdivide the surfaces into small rectangles tiles (Modify>Surface Subdivision>Rectangular tiles) and then choose to simulate selected objects. This way is more time consuming but it works fine. I've tried what you are attempting as well but in vain. Let me know if it works out for you.

Hope this helps,
Thanks,
Pallavi

First things first, if your friend does not know the available
software, then your friend probably doesn't have the acoustic training
needed to be able to make a useful prediction when he/she gets some
software.  It would be like giving eQuest so someone who has no
experience in architecture or buildling engineering and expecting them
to make a useful prediction of energy use or HVAC load.  To do
anything useful your friend will need to learn the basics of
acoustics.  A couple recommended introductory acoustics books that
discuss community noise fairly well are the Handbook of Environmental
Acoustics by James Cowen, and Architectural Acoustics by Marshall Long

But, to answer the question on software

What is your friend trying to predict?
Noise from HVAC equipment near a building?  Noise from an industrial
or event facility  and its community impact?  Traffic noise?
Aircraft noise?

Outdoor HVAC noise near a building  can be predicted using the Trace
Acoustics Program (TAP) or the McQuay Acoustic Analyzer
http://www.trane.com/Commercial/DNA/View.aspx?i=1245
http://www.mcquay.com/McQuay/DesignSolutions/AcousticAnalyzer


The two most popular software programs for community noise prediction
and mapping are Soundplan and cadnaA.
http://www.soundplan.com/
http://www.acu-vib.com.au/cadna.htm

Traffic noise is usually predicted using the Federal Highway
departments traffic noise model software
http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/noise/tnm/index.htm

Aircraft Noise is usually predicted using the Integrates Noise Model (INM)

Message-ID: <9D041E1A31761D48887126EADA8318CD67E9F60682@CCRD001.mail.lan>

All,

I need to calculate shading coefficient of a window glass with and without the effect of a shading fin. I could not find any software that does this for me so this is how I'm trying to calculate it: Calculate window heat gain for both cases from Eplus and then perform a manual calculation to get shading coefficient of the window. Since the shading coefficient is the ratio of solar heat gain admitted through the glass as compared to the solar heat gain admitted through 1/8" clear glass (1/8" clear glass = 1.0 Shading Coefficient) under similar conditions... so If I simulate the base case as 1/8" clear glass... and then calculate the ratio.. I should get my result... (?)

Did anyone of you face this kind of a scenario before? Can you please shed some light on this?
Would you know of any tools that does this kind of simulation?
Any input is highly appreciated!

Thanks,
Pallavi

Hi,
I think the software Helios developed by LBNL would be helpful.

Another suggestion: you can pick up some glazing/window samples from the envelope library in the help files of eQUEST. I have calculated the shading coefficient of some devices for the city of Guangzhou, China. If you like, I can send them to you.

Dear BLDG-SIM Members, 

As part of my PhD research I am conducting a research about Architects 
Friendly Building Energy Simulation Tools (BESTs), so that we can improve 
the future development of simulation tools. Therefore the survey is 
dedicated to gather information from beginner simulation tools users. 

First of all, I am asking you please to take the survey and secondly, to 
spread this survey to any to other simulation tools users who meet the 
criteria mentioned below: 

1-Architects or 2-Designers or 3-Graduate students or 4-Beginner Users who 
use simulation tools to create sustainable architecture in the USA 

The survey has 22 questions and the duration is 10-15 minutes. The 
compared tools are: 

ECOTECT, HEED, Energy 10, Design Builder, eQUEST, DOE-2, Green Design 
Studio, IES VE, Energy Plus and Energy Plus-Sketchup Plugin. 

You can access the survey via: 

http://www.esurveyspro.com/Survey.aspx?id=1ae0b334-2eca-4c3a-bf68-9db60b81bd45 

and if if you have any questions please don't hesitate to contact me. 

Best regards, 

Shady Attia |PhD Student| ARCHITECTURE ET CLIMAT| BELGIUM 

PS: you can also send me a mailing list and I will send the invitations.

Dear Bldg-Sim community,

Many years ago, I used "A Simplified Energy Analysis Method" software, which
was a bin analysis energy modeling tool.  I'm interested in finding it
again, primarily for existing building models, but can't locate it.

Has anyone got current contact info for that program?

Thanks in advance!

All,

I keep getting this fatal error in E+ : Reading Weather Data Line, Invalid Date, Year=2001, Month=2, Day=32 , even though I'm simulating for a single day in October. I've tried changing my run period and it only works for the month of January...

Did anybody face this error before? Do you have to open up the weather file and fix it?

Thanks,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Determine the Title-24 standard HVAC system
Message-ID: <1229989351.495025e72ffae@webmail.vt.edu>

Hi-
I have a question for determining the Title-24 standard case HVAC system type.
The standard says:
"Include a description of the required user input for: building type, system
type (especially single zone or multizone),
heating source, and cooling source, so that the ACM and the reference method can
properly determine
the Standard HVAC System and Plant in the standard building design".

The standard states that the proposed design HVAC type is not related to the
baseline HVAC system type.
For a 50,000 sf building (college student activity center) with VAV, chilled/hot
water coils and fossile fuel for heating, what type of standard system is
correct for the buiding?

Thanks,

Ying

Eric, please correct me if I'm wrong but I though a chilled beam was an 
induction unit; and eQuest has both powered and non-powered induction 
units. Also, if you look at the HVAC units you input there is an Outdoor 
Air tab that will let you specify either an Air Change Rate or 
Sherman-Grimsrud Method (based on wind) for Natural Ventilation. Either 
method requires the creation of schedules, but I've found both to be 
effective.

Message-ID: <9afae6850812231116i2155c230x7c9f5a384076a73f@mail.gmail.com>

Has anyone successfully run a T24 or SBD model with parking garage
lighting?

I am developing a model for Savings by Design and T24 compliance.  A large
part of the load is parking garage lighting that is subject to T24
compliance.  When selecting an occupancy type in the compliance section
there is no option for "parking garage" as there is in the T24
standard. The code is 0.4 w/sf and there is no space selection
available at this LPD.
If I designate the space as a different occupancy type, the compliance model
and SBD will not be correct.  ***Erik Dyrr,****** C.E.M., LEED A.P.******

Hi  JV;

This question was asked and resolved about  3 years ago.
As I remember the person who had the Program only had 5.25" Floppy Disks.
We still have 5.25" Floppy capability but we are about to shed our old 
formats
support, no one ever calls for it.  We have QIC-120, QIC-250, 3010, 
TR-1, TR-2, TR-3, TR-4
tape capability. We have ZIP-100, Zip-250 capability. We expect to 
abandon this already offline hardware in
the next 30 days !!!  We have not had 8" floppy capability for several 
years.  There are 5 or 6
different ways to get the timing holes in 8" floppy disks so unless you 
had DSDD's things could
be sparse.

Dear Gregg,
 
With some luck, the campus will know how they've derived the ton-hr billing
rate and you could apply those unit rates and overhead factors to your
single building.  Much of the time,  though, the billing rates are "seat of
the pants"-based or were developed long ago by people who no longer work
there.....  Good luck!

Also - if you're doing this for LEED documentation and the project was
registered AFTER May 28th 2008, you will need to comply with the
modeling protocols in this document:

 

http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=4176

 

 

Otherwise, the best way to do this is to get the rates (as James has
described below) and set up a steam meter and utility rate based on the
rate. Make sure that the chilled water rate calculated takes into
account the cooling tower loads as well. 

 

Lastly - you will find that when you model the chilled water rates, your
utility bills probably go down (or they should), while your energy use
goes up.  I had a similar issue and was confused, until it was pointed
out to me that the cooling energy reported in the BEPU report is
actually the space cooling load and not the actual energy. In reality,
if you have a campus chiller that runs at 0.65 kW/ton and with cooling
tower energy (pumps fans etc) it goes up to 0.75 kW/ton, then you need
to factor that in to get the actual cooling energy. Keep in mind - you
only need to factor in the heat rejection energy (cooling tower fans &
pumps) - not the chilled water loop energy - that should already be
modeled. If your COP of the system - chiller+heat rejection is 4 (for
simplicity), then your actual cooling load is 1/4th the reported load. 

 

Hope this helps

My interpretation is that the EQ credits are based on the actual design and don't reference EAC1 or ASHRAE 90.1.

Hi,

I am working on LEED EA c1 and EQ c7.1. Per ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G, where no heat or cooling system exists, the heating or cooling system shall be identical to the system modeled in the baseline building design. For EQ c7.1 Thermal comfort, should I use the real HVAC system design excluding the fake heating or cooling systems modeled in equest to comply with ASHRAE 55? Any feedback on this issue is highly appreciated.

Best,

Shaojie

innovative product of the year at the 2008 LightFair International.  It's
from Architectural Energy Corp. (www.archenergy.com) and is meant to "assist

Pallavi,

Go to  www.chhayaonline.org and try out the beta version.  Attached is
the PDF version of the technical paper we wrote for the ASES conference
earlier this year. The program is still in development - especially the
weather import tools, but this might be exactly what you are looking
for. If you need, I can send you the weather file you need.

 

If you look at section 4.0 (pg 3) of the paper, it describes how the
effective shading coefficient is calculated based on the profile angle
and the window overhang. The program allows you to play around with the
overhangs and updates the shading coefficient matrix real time. 

 

Feel free to call me if you have any questions.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Window Heat gain - Shading Coefficient

 

All,

 

I need to calculate shading coefficient of a window glass with and
without the effect of a shading fin. I could not find any software that
does this for me so this is how I'm trying to calculate it: Calculate
window heat gain for both cases from Eplus and then perform a manual
calculation to get shading coefficient of the window. Since the shading
coefficient is the ratio of solar heat gain admitted through the glass
as compared to the solar heat gain admitted through 1/8" clear glass
(1/8" clear glass = 1.0 Shading Coefficient) under similar conditions...
so If I simulate the base case as 1/8" clear glass... and then calculate
the ratio.. I should get my result... (?)

 

Did anyone of you face this kind of a scenario before? Can you please
shed some light on this?

Would you know of any tools that does this kind of simulation?

Any input is highly appreciated!

 

Thanks,

Pallavi

Message-ID: <4B55C0CF3DB1354A9524C7D455EE6D4901617E97@HQGTNEVS-04.doe.local>

OpenStudio v 1.0 was recently released by DOE.  OpenStudio (formerly
known as the Energy Design Plugin) is a free plugin for Google's
SketchUp 3D drawing program. The plugin makes it easy to create and edit
the building geometry in EnergyPlus input files and to run simulations
directly within SketchUp. OpenStudio was created by the National
Renewable Energy Laboratory for DOE and can be downloaded free at
www.energyplus.gov <http://www.energyplus.gov/> .

OpenStudio provides users with access to all the standard SketchUp tools
and capabilities while creating and editing EnergyPlus input files.
Users can add as much extra detail as needed to zones and surfaces, view
the building geometry from any vantage point, apply different rendering
styles, and perform accurate shadowing studies. Users also can mix
EnergyPlus simulation content with decorative content such as background
images, landscaping, people, and architectural finish details-all within
the same SketchUp model.

EnergyPlus Version 3.0, released in November, is available for Windows,
Linux, and Macintosh operating systems, and includes several new
features such as new datasets, input syntax changes, updated zone and
ventilation controls and models, enhanced cost calculations and economic
reporting, and extended documentation and guides. 

The OpenStudio plugin is compatible with both the Free and the Pro
versions of Google SketchUp 6 & 7 for Windows. A version for Mac OS X is
currently in development. OpenStudio will have full access to all of the
plugin functionality once both EnergyPlus and SketchUp are installed on
your computer.

More information, along with a form to register for a free download of
the OpenStudio plugin and EnergyPlus, is available at www.energyplus.gov
<http://www.energyplus.gov/> .

I have a real nice equest model of a hotel that looks great, produces

We are using mostly PTACs with a few fan coil units (HW/DX).

 

Any obvious reasons why this many unmet load hours is happening?

Dear Bldg-Sim list,

I'm still unable to track down ASEAM (although several of you provided
helpful leads), so I'll phrase the question differently:

I want to create a simple energy model of:
1) existing buildings 
2) which use more than one HVAC system
3) using the ACTUAL weather data from the last 12 months. 

Any suggestions?

Dear Bldg-Sim community,

Many years ago, I used "A Simplified Energy Analysis Method" software, which
was a bin analysis energy modeling tool.  I'm interested in finding it
again, primarily for existing building models, but can't locate it.

Has anyone got current contact info for that program?

Thanks in advance!

Hi all,

 

I am modeling a water source heat pump system and can't seem to find out
where this excess miscellaneous/auxillary energy is coming from.  I have
determined that it is definitely coming from the heat pump system in
question.  When I look at the PS-C report and compare the energy of the
two pumps assigned to the system with the total energy listed on the
electric meter that I have the system assigned to, the total on the meter
is almost twice as large as the combined pump energy.

 

I can't for the life of me figure out what else in the SYSTEM = HP type
system could be contributing to the pumps/aux category.  Has anyone else
noticed this?  Am I missing something?

electric meter that I have the system assigned to, the total on the meter
is almost twice as large as the combined pump energy.

 

I can't for the life of me figure out what else in the SYSTEM = HP type
system could be contributing to the pumps/aux category.  Has anyone else
noticed this?  Am I missing something?

Well, I found it.  It's the fluid cooler pump.

I should also be clear that I'm modeling the same building with a GSHP
system using the same system type but a different CDW loop and am not
experiencing the same problem.

That was my first thought but I don't see crank case heater defined
anywhere in the HVAC systems tab.  Where is this defined?  I even looked
in the BDL file and the HP system doesn't even have the CRANKCASE-HEAT
keyword, where another system in the same project (TYPE = PSZ) does.

Hi all,

 

I am modeling a water source heat pump system and can't seem to find out
where this excess miscellaneous/auxillary energy is coming from.  I have
determined that it is definitely coming from the heat pump system in
question.  When I look at the PS-C report and compare the energy of the
two pumps assigned to the system with the total energy listed on the
electric meter that I have the system assigned to, the total on the meter
is almost twice as large as the combined pump energy.

 

I can't for the life of me figure out what else in the SYSTEM = HP type
system could be contributing to the pumps/aux category.  Has anyone else
noticed this?  Am I missing something?

The Commonwealth of Virginia and its wonderful State Corporation Commission
allows some very heinous, nasty billing practices concerning electric bills,
I'm "all electric" here as far as the utility  company is concerned.........

They allow the number of days in a month's bill to vary between 28 and 
35 days;
AND  any two same months ie  December 2008 and December 2009 DO NOT
have the same number of days billed in general....There is a listing of 
the kwhr
used for each of the previous 12 months on each month's bill but there 
is no mention
of days in the billing cycles, HDDs or CDDs for those months. ... the 
days billed is
only given for the current month and requests for old records from the power
company were returned without days billed also.

Every State is supposed to have a Climatology Record, Virginia's record 
is at
The University of Virginia.  Look at the NOAA website to track down the
records for the state in question.  I suggest on-site daily readings for 
high
performance buildings. I got 120 gallons of 143 F water from my "Oversquare"
array today at my house and it's December 30 just 9 days off Dec 21....
At a customer site just 12 miles away they were 40% overcast between noon
and 2 pm, critical hours this time of year.

Do you want to stage the multiple heating systems ?? My biggest problem 
with E+
is the lack of "innovation" available in the heating systems to be 
modeled. I have
tricks up my sleeve that just destroy conventional heating systems. You 
might not
want to do some of these on a large commercial building, but on a 
residence with
telecommuting from home... it's Solar Sailing in an unlimited 10 meter 
boat...

Peter,

Something else that can cause a lot of unmet load hours is too much of a nighttime setback. If it takes a long time for the system to warm-up or cool-down in the morning, that time can really add up.

Also check to make sure that the PTACs are allowed to "cycle at night." If the heating and cooling equipment is not allowed to run during unoccupied mode, that can cause a long morning warm-up or cool-down.

Another thing to check is the location of the thermostat for zones with different load characteristics. For example, a storage room next to an occupied room might be on the same temperature control zone, but if the thermostat is in the main room, the storage room may not get what it needs and have unmet load hours.

Try making your thermostats reverse acting and increase the deadband between heating and cooling.

And send us the .INP and .PD2 if you would like us to review your inputs.

We are all professional here, so it is just an offer to help.

I have a real nice equest model of a hotel that looks great, produces very believable annual energy profiles BUT has about 75% of zones listed as many thousands of unmet load hours, both cooling and heating.

We are using mostly PTACs with a few fan coil units (HW/DX).

Any obvious reasons why this many unmet load hours is happening?

Must be something simple but I am new to this program and cannot find it

Thanks in advance for any assistance!
