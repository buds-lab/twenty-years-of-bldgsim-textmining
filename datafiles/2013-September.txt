Hi Sambhav,

90.1 Appendix G has specific language addressing the limited conditions under which chiller secondary pumps have variable speed drives.  This occurs in the last few pages of Appendix G.

Dear All,
               in my baseline model the chiller is centrifugal type . Now as per ashrae protocol we have to consider VFD in secondary pumps as well as AHU for system 8 . but if my chiller is centrifugal whether i have to consider VFD in chiller also for baseline model?

	sensitive occupant)
Message-ID: <1378232058.67630.YahooMailNeo@web163606.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Apologies if off-topic, but perhaps someone with HVAC experience in this arena can provide some insights off-line.


-------------

I recently vacated my house due to mold contamination. Problems were extensive in subfloor and crawlspace. Kitchen and several bathrooms had to be gutted. Remediation is now complete, and remodeling nearing completion. House has an??American Standard AUD100R9V5K4? Ser #8235NSX1G?forced air furnace, and no cooling system (located in Colorado). The system is 100% recirc, with no humidifier. We have kept the furnace, but replaced all ducts to eliminate concern of mold spore contamination. All interior surfaces of building have been 'treated', and all personal belongings removed.?Unfortunately, we have learned that sometimes even dead mold spores can linger (clinging to surfaces, etc), and if inhaled by a sensitive occupant (that's me), can then induce recurrence of health problems.?

Question: What would be the best way to introduce high quality filtration to this system? (At this point, targets include spores, pollen, and even chemicals off-gassing from new materials).?
Obvious options would seem to include:?

- high Merv-rating filters in existing furnace
- 'sidecar' HEPA / Activated charcoal unit on the CAR (a good option, but doesn't treat 100% of the air)
- UV has fallen out of favor since we don't have a cooling coil to point it at, and not sure what other surface would be appropriate
- Electric / ionizing systems have fallen out of favor due to ozone conerns
- Could fabricate a deck in the CAR just upstream of furnace to receive a HEPA filter, and suffer the fan energy penalty in exchange for additional filtration confidence.
- Not sure what to make of stand-alone Activated Charcoal filters -- seems like they need to be discharged frequently. True?
- Another option would be to go with just the MERV filter in the furnace, then purchase mobile stand-alone HEPA / Charcoal units for main rooms of each floor. More local control, but more noise.
- Are there other options we're missing?

Note:
- We are well aware of benefits of OA in such situations, but there are complications with high smoke and ozone days in this region, so 100% will actually be desirable at times -- and night flushing is a common strategy when conditions allow. Also, the house is 115yrs old, so infiltration is significant anyway.?
- HRV would obviously come into play if we pursue an OA configuration, but when filtration requirements are added, we're concerned about complexity of system.

Has anyone gone through this type of exercise? Comments / suggestions welcome.?

Regards,

Adam

ASHRAE/IBPSA-USA Building Simulation Conference Announced

ATLANTA ?ASHRAE and IBPSA-USA have announced a joint conference that merges the IBPSA-USA SimBuild and ASHRAE Energy Modeling Conferences.

The joint conference, entitled 2014 ASHRAE/IBPSA-USA Building Simulation Conference, Sept. 10-12, 2014, Atlanta, Ga., currently has a call for papers.

?This conference is a first for the industry, and we?re excited about the benefits it can bring to the building energy analysis and performance simulation community,? Dennis Knight, Conference chair, said.  The conference seeks to improve the industry?s ability to accurately model building performance.

Modelers, software developers, owners and researchers will address the practices of energy modeling and building performance simulation using existing simulation tools, software development, and future simulation research and applications.

The conference is focusing on "BIM, BEM and SIM ? Integrated Building Design and Modeling,? addressing building information modeling, building energy modeling and building simulation.

?The most pressing need facing modelers is transferring data between tools, and this conference seeks to provide answers through the conference content and by bringing together practitioners, software developers and the research community,? Knight said.

Currently, organizers are seeking papers on topics addressing the integration and interoperability of analytic modeling tools (BEM and SIM) with physical modeling tools (BIM). In addition, papers are sought describing workarounds, case studies, how to's, challenges, barriers and cloud based solutions.

Topics include:
?	Energy efficiency
?	HVAC component modeling
?	Urban scale modeling
?	HVAC load analysis
?	Lighting and daylighting
?	Computational fluid dynamics
?	Data exchange and interoperability
?	Energy auditing
?	Life cycle cost and economic analysis
?	Model calibration and validation
?	Combined use of multiple tools
?	Co-simulation
?	Optimization
?	Model and algorithm advances
?	Moisture
?	Weather data

Abstracts (400 or less words in length) are due Nov.  4, 2013. If accepted, papers are due March 3, 2014. The conference papers will be a maximum of 8 pages in length.

To submit an abstract or for more information, visit www.ashrae.org/simulation2014.

A call for presenters will be announced after the call for papers closes.  Invited speakers and keynote speakers will be announced.

The conference will cover two-and-a half days and will be preceded by two days of training seminars and short courses.

?The goal of the conference is help make better decisions through the application of simulation and modeling over the entire building life cycle from the earliest concept through operation and maintenance,? Knight said.

ASHRAE, founded in 1894, is a building technology society with more than 50,000 members worldwide. The Society and its members focus on building systems, energy efficiency, indoor air quality, refrigeration and sustainability. Through research, standards writing, publishing, certification and continuing education, ASHRAE shapes tomorrow?s built environment today. More information can be found at www.ashrae.org/news.

IBPSA-USA is the United States regional affiliate of the International Building Performance Simulation Association (IBPSA). The mission of IBPSA-USA is to advance and promote the science of building simulation in order to improve the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of new and existing buildings in the United States.

Message-ID: <52267D45.1050504@cox.net>

Hi Guys;

If some one really wants to run  ASEAM,  I have a machine mothballed 
that runs

Windows 98SE and can boot in the DOS 3.31 mode.  It is an 800 Mhz Pentium

SECC Cartridge CPU and I believe it has  512 MB memory installed with 
768 MB max.

  It has RAID 0 twin 40 GBs,  3.5: floppy, CD burner,  5 cartridge tape 
drives

as well as IO Mega Zip Drive  250 MB.  I will have to check to see if the

AGP video card still works.  This machine can access many cartridge tape 
formats.

Motherboard is Intel  SE440BX2NAV .   Let me know..

Hi John!

Funny thing is - running a properly configured version of ASEAM locally and quickly TODAY on an untethered Galaxy, IOS or Windows tablet might be kind of cool. Game-changing even.

Does anyone know if any way to (easily) re-compile it?

My $0.02 of contribution.  I have many fond (and not so fond) memories of ASEAM.

My memories are that it was very limited - which is why I re-wrote and expanded it a lot.  Lost that code, though, when I left U of Michigan.

Dear Forums,
I am looking for a source of part load performance for R717 (ammonia) compressors ? about 200TR capacity. Will someone please point me in the right direction?
Thank you!

Hi Adam,

This posting is reaching an audience which includes many mechanical designers of varying experience, and there are no rules restricting the subject matter over the mailing lists, but I think you may crossing a line of comfort for many professionals by presenting a series of questions which are essentially seeking to arrive at medical/healthcare advice.

Any responsible response on this forum would absolutely include the direction to consult your physician first.  For professional liability reasons, it may also be correct to say there is no other responsible way to respond to this query.  Anything along the lines of "what I would do..." invites the possibility for someone (maybe not you) to "lawyer up" down the road.

That said, I am comfortable sharing a few general and succinct points which cannot be construed as medical advice:

*         Consider particulate filtration (dust/pollen/mold/smoke) and gas phase filtration (ozone, off-gassing of materials) as two separate problems.  There are 'hybrid' products intended to address both categories, but a really fancy particulate filter should not be expected to pick up gaseous contaminants and vice versa.

*         Gas phase filtration media (i.e. activated carbon) DOES require a replacement schedule to maintain a continued effect, and the only way to determine that frequency for a specific environment is with testing.

*         If outdoor gas (ozone)  and particulate (smoke) contaminants are bad enough, a leaky envelope (and windows/doors left open) can overwhelm even extensive efforts to improve indoor air quality.  Practical and affordable measures to minimize infiltration should be considered as part of your filtration strategy.

*         Here is a solid link for further reading on the topic of IAQ, with many published research and resources specific to the topics you're bringing to the table: http://www.epa.gov/iaq/pubs/residair.html

I hope this helps answer some of the non-medical facets of your query!  Definitely consult a healthcare professional for recommendations to arrive at a strategy that fits your needs.

Regards,

~Nick

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Filter options for residential retrofit (chemically sensitive occupant)

Apologies if off-topic, but perhaps someone with HVAC experience in this arena can provide some insights off-line.

-------------

I recently vacated my house due to mold contamination. Problems were extensive in subfloor and crawlspace. Kitchen and several bathrooms had to be gutted. Remediation is now complete, and remodeling nearing completion. House has an  American Standard AUD100R9V5K4  Ser #8235NSX1G forced air furnace, and no cooling system (located in Colorado). The system is 100% recirc, with no humidifier. We have kept the furnace, but replaced all ducts to eliminate concern of mold spore contamination. All interior surfaces of building have been 'treated', and all personal belongings removed. Unfortunately, we have learned that sometimes even dead mold spores can linger (clinging to surfaces, etc), and if inhaled by a sensitive occupant (that's me), can then induce recurrence of health problems.

Question: What would be the best way to introduce high quality filtration to this system? (At this point, targets include spores, pollen, and even chemicals off-gassing from new materials).
Obvious options would seem to include:

- high Merv-rating filters in existing furnace
- 'sidecar' HEPA / Activated charcoal unit on the CAR (a good option, but doesn't treat 100% of the air)
- UV has fallen out of favor since we don't have a cooling coil to point it at, and not sure what other surface would be appropriate
- Electric / ionizing systems have fallen out of favor due to ozone conerns
- Could fabricate a deck in the CAR just upstream of furnace to receive a HEPA filter, and suffer the fan energy penalty in exchange for additional filtration confidence.
- Not sure what to make of stand-alone Activated Charcoal filters -- seems like they need to be discharged frequently. True?
- Another option would be to go with just the MERV filter in the furnace, then purchase mobile stand-alone HEPA / Charcoal units for main rooms of each floor. More local control, but more noise.
- Are there other options we're missing?

Note:
- We are well aware of benefits of OA in such situations, but there are complications with high smoke and ozone days in this region, so 100% will actually be desirable at times -- and night flushing is a common strategy when conditions allow. Also, the house is 115yrs old, so infiltration is significant anyway.
- HRV would obviously come into play if we pursue an OA configuration, but when filtration requirements are added, we're concerned about complexity of system.

Has anyone gone through this type of exercise? Comments / suggestions welcome.

Regards,

Adam

You can try this forum, I'm sure some of the members are familiar. It isn't a primary reason most people will have joined the mailing list. A few questions on the topic might be okay, especially pertaining to how an energy model might be used in the M&V process.

If it became very common to have M&V questions by yourself or others I think it should be moved to another venue.

A couple of other potential resources for you:


1.       If your questions are specific to LEED certification, you should try LEED User.


2.       I don't know if a forum exists on StackExchange.com, but there could be an M&V forum there, I haven't looked.


3.       ASHRAE also has a new message board www.ASHRAExCHANGE.org<http://www.ASHRAExCHANGE.org> which is definitely an appropriate forum, but may not see heavy traffic.

I hope this helps!

In this month?s IBPSA-NYC meet, we?re switching gears and instead of
exploring simulation tools, we?re taking a look at new and innovative ways
to visualize building performance data. Visualizing performance data to
tell a good story is often under discussed and we hope to pull back the
covers on it a bit. Hope you can join us in this conversation!

Descriptions

Presentation 1

Title: Dhour - Grasshopper Based Visualization Toolkit

Kyle Steinfeld, Assistant Professor, Department of Architecture, University
of California, Berkeley

This presentation will detail a new prototyping visualization toolkit
called "Dhour", developed for the Grasshopper visual programming
environment, which enables the situational development of information
graphics. By enabling more nuanced and customizable views of complex data,
the software described here offers designers an exploratory framework in
contrast to the highly directed tools currently available.

About the Speaker: Kyle Steinfeld is an Assistant Professor specializing in
digital design technologies in the Department of Architecture at University
of California Berkeley, where he teaches undergraduate and graduate design
studios, core courses in architectural representation, and advanced
seminars in digital modeling and visualization.  Professionally, he has
worked with and consulted for a number of design firms, including Skidmore
Owings and Merrill, Acconci Studio, Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates,
Howler/Yoon, Diller Scofidio Renfro, and TEN Arquitectos.  His research
interests include collaborative design technology platforms and bioclimatic
design visualization, and he holds a Masters of Architecture from MIT and a
Bachelor's Degree in Design from the University of Florida.


Presentation 2

Title: Visualizing Building Performance Data

Neil Katz, Associate, Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, Chicago

Visualizing analysis results can be as important as generating the analysis
itself. This information should be presented in a way that non-engineers -
a client, a designer - can understand, and (even more importantly) can be
used as part of the design process to improve and optimize a design; ie.
can be used as a decision-making tool. This is particularly true during the
early design phases of a project.

This presentation highlights examples of visualizing energy and lighting
analysis results, through color-coded graphs, mapping results onto
visually-identifiable building models, and even animating the results
through time. One project will be presented as a case study, and additional
visualization examples will be shown as well.

About the Speaker: Neil Katz is an architect with Skidmore, Owings &
Merrill. His area of expertise is ?computational design?, which includes
parametric and algorithmic design and modeling, building information
modeling, and various kinds of analysis. While computational tools
(computers and applications) are intensely used and developed,
?computational design? is more an approach to design than these tools.

Geometry and visualization are important aspects of his work, which is
primarily immersed in projects as part of the project team, but also
includes research which spans many projects (and some research is
independent of projects).

Neil has taught parametric modeling and various software applications at
the office and at schools of architecture in New York and Chicago
(including: NYU, the New York School of Interior Design, Parsons / the New
School, IIT, and the School of the Art Institute).

Vikram,

Speaking as a mechanical contractor and former HVAC equipment manufacturer's representative, I can say that without a lot of experience, it can be incredibly risky to use rules of thumb for pricing AHU's.  Cost could easily range from $2/CFM to $10+/CFM based on the capacity, construction details, features, brand, etc.

When in doubt and when you need a quick budget, just reach out to your local product reps.  As Vinay posted, AAON is a quality manufacturer.  Carrier, Trane, McQuay, and others also build good products.  Most engineered product reps will carry multiple brands to cover a wide range of features and price points.  These people will (usually) be more than happy to run a selection and provide a budget price for you.  If you're not familiar with your local reps, check the manufacturer websites or call--they will usually point you to the local sales office.  Or your local ASHRAE chapter might provide a useful directory.

When speaking with the reps, it's best to give them as much detail as possible about what you're looking for.  Early in the design process you might not have every detail, but the sooner you can tell them supply CFM and external static pressure, return CFM and external static pressure (if applicable), cooling source and capacity, heating source and capacity, whether or not there will be energy recovery, type of filtration required, whether it needs to be installed inside or outside, and anything else you can share the better.  Obviously, the more detail you can provide, the better, so they can narrow down the best product that fits and price it with the features needed.

Of course, keep in mind that installation of that equipment is another animal....  For that, you might want to strike up a friendship with a local mechanical contractor.

Good luck!

  *   Designing low energy buildings in support of net zero energy strategies
  *   Emerging strategies for net zero energy buildings
  *   Technologies in support of net zero energy, water, carbon, and waste strategies
  *   Net zero certification schemes
  *   Regional, national, and local net zero strategies and programs
  *   Case studies relevant to net zero energy, water, carbon solutions
  *   Net zero energy communities
The iiSBE nZBE 2014 Symposium website can be accessed here: http://www.cce.ufl.edu/iisbe-net-zero

Important Dates:
Oct 15, 2013 - Deadline for abstracts
Nov 15, 2013 - Notification of acceptance of abstracts
Feb 7, 2014 - Deadline for submission of papers

Subject: [Equest-users] IBPSA-NYC Event: Innovative Ways to Visualize Building Performance Data

In this month's IBPSA-NYC meet, we're switching gears and instead of exploring simulation tools, we're taking a look at new and innovative ways to visualize building performance data. Visualizing performance data to tell a good story is often under discussed and we hope to pull back the covers on it a bit. Hope you can join us in this conversation!

Presentation 1

Title: Dhour - Grasshopper Based Visualization Toolkit

Kyle Steinfeld, Assistant Professor, Department of Architecture, University of California, Berkeley


This presentation will detail a new prototyping visualization toolkit called "Dhour", developed for the Grasshopper visual programming environment, which enables the situational development of information graphics. By enabling more nuanced and customizable views of complex data, the software described here offers designers an exploratory framework in contrast to the highly directed tools currently available.

About the Speaker: Kyle Steinfeld is an Assistant Professor specializing in digital design technologies in the Department of Architecture at University of California Berkeley, where he teaches undergraduate and graduate design studios, core courses in architectural representation, and advanced seminars in digital modeling and visualization.  Professionally, he has worked with and consulted for a number of design firms, including Skidmore Owings and Merrill, Acconci Studio, Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates, Howler/Yoon, Diller Scofidio Renfro, and TEN Arquitectos.  His research interests include collaborative design technology platforms and bioclimatic design visualization, and he holds a Masters of Architecture from MIT and a Bachelor's Degree in Design from the University of Florida.


Presentation 2

Title: Visualizing Building Performance Data

Neil Katz, Associate, Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, Chicago


Visualizing analysis results can be as important as generating the analysis itself. This information should be presented in a way that non-engineers - a client, a designer - can understand, and (even more importantly) can be used as part of the design process to improve and optimize a design; ie. can be used as a decision-making tool. This is particularly true during the early design phases of a project.


This presentation highlights examples of visualizing energy and lighting analysis results, through color-coded graphs, mapping results onto visually-identifiable building models, and even animating the results through time. One project will be presented as a case study, and additional visualization examples will be shown as well.


About the Speaker: Neil Katz is an architect with Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. His area of expertise is "computational design", which includes parametric and algorithmic design and modeling, building information modeling, and various kinds of analysis. While computational tools (computers and applications) are intensely used and developed, "computational design" is more an approach to design than these tools.


Geometry and visualization are important aspects of his work, which is primarily immersed in projects as part of the project team, but also includes research which spans many projects (and some research is independent of projects).

Neil has taught parametric modeling and various software applications at the office and at schools of architecture in New York and Chicago (including: NYU, the New York School of Interior Design, Parsons / the New School, IIT, and the School of the Art Institute).

Hi,

Good luck finding that in epw format.

If you come empty handed, at worse you could maybe use Mombasa in Kenya, which is not "that" far away and also on the coast (roughly 300km south). Maybe check some weather data and see if they seem to have similar climate or not...

Ok, so I received this comment.  The one with the provide ASHRAE minimums in the Baseline for spaces with DCV.  I understand this is a generic comment - Ok.
However, LEED IEQ Credit 2 is not being pursued and the ASHRAE minimum ventilation requirements are what is being Proposed for in each space that has DCV.

Does this not mean that the Baseline ventilation rate and the Proposed ventilation rate will still be equal?
Not sure how to respond other than to simply say what is stated here.

Thanks,
Kevin

I think this requirement comes from the mandatory provisions of 90.1.

6.4.3.4.3 Shutoff Damper Controls. Both outdoor
air supply and exhaust systems shall be equipped with motorized
dampers that will automatically shut when the systems or
spaces served are not in use. Ventilation outdoor air dampers
shall be capable of automatically shutting off during preoccupancy
building warm-up, cool down, and setback, except
when ventilation reduces energy costs (e.g., night purge) or
when ventilation must be supplied to meet code requirements.

Thoughts??

Dear Patrick,

Thank you for sharing this GBCI response!  It is very informative and, while I won't admit that I've been modeling anything incorrectly, I am going to change a couple of things :).
In particular, I have heard on several occasions that the Increased Ventilation credit was a clear case of "IEQ vs. energy"; you make a decision to trade one against the other.  After reading the GBCI response below and then double-checking with ASHRAE 90.1, I find that they are consistent with each other and effectively allow no penalty for the increased energy caused by increased ventilation.  Very curious, considering there is no science which demonstrates a health benefit for outdoor airflows greater than that required by ASHRAE 62.1!
The other item is that I failed to notice (and still can't find) anything in 621.1 which says that unoccupied ventilation should be zero.  I guess that is OK, but is also curious, since a portion of the ventilation calcs in 62.1 include consideration for off-gassing materials (which are always present.)
All in all, I'm smarter than I was as a result of your post, so it's a good day!  Thanks again.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] usgbc response to outdoor air question

back in september there was a thread about what the outdoor air rate in a baseline simulation should be compared to a proposed simulation, specifically when one is adding 30% more outdoor air to meet the ieqc2 requirement and earn 1 leed point.  there were differences of opinions about the flow rates between baseline and proposed being either the same (as required in 90.1 app g) or the baseline being the calculated per 62.1 and the proposed being as designed.

so i submitted a support request to the usgbc and the reply i received is below, but in short the response is that unless you're using dcv optionally the outdoor air rates in the baseline and proposed energy simulations for eac1 should be the same.  the response below gives the standard responses to differing outdoor air rate scenarios.

Dear Patrick,

Thank you for contacting the Green Building Certification Institute.

You ask very good questions related to the relationship between ASHRAE Standards 62.1 and 90.1, and how these standards are applied across multiple LEED Rating System prerequisites and credits.

The simple answer to your question is that, for systems without demand controlled ventilation, the outdoor air included in EA Credit 1 energy simulations must be the same in the Baseline and Proposed cases. If the project is attempting IEQ Credit 2 Increased Ventilation, then the values calculated in IEQc2 must be used in the EAc1 Basline and Proposed case energy models. Note that IEQc2 does not limit the project to providing only 30% more outdoor air than AHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate Procedure minimums, so higher amounts are acceptable, as long as they are modeled identically in both the Baseline and Proposed case energy models.

The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems that do not have demand controlled ventilation:

It is unclear whether the minimum outside air rates (in CFM) were modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case for all zones not having Demand Control Ventilation in the Proposed case. Please confirm that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed cases using the proposed case rates. Additionally, please verify that all systems in both the baseline and proposed case are modeled with zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case).

The situation becomes a bit more complicated in you have systems that have demand controlled ventilation (often implemented as Carbon Dioxide control of outdoor air or as programmed control of outdoor air based on occupancy sensors.) In this case the Baseline case energy model must include the minimum outdoor air as determined by the ASHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate Procedure calculations for all systems having demand controlled ventilation.

The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems that do have demand controlled ventilation:

Demand control ventilation was modeled for credit in the proposed case. Appendix G allows schedule changes for demand control ventilation as approved by the rating authority (Table G3.1#4(Baseline)). As the LEED Certification rating authority, GBCI requires that the outside air ventilation rates for the Baseline case be modeled using minimum ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or 2007 for LEED-NC 2009 projects) rates wherever credit is taken for demand control ventilation in the Proposed case. The proposed case minimum rates at design conditions should be modeled as designed. Please verify that the Baseline Case model reflects ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or 2007) minimum rates for any spaces where credit is taken for demand control ventilation, or revise the model accordingly. For all other spaces, please confirm that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed cases. Additionally, please verify that all systems in both the baseline and proposed cases are modeled with zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case).

Finally, even though you don't address energy recovery in your question, whether or not you have energy recovery in your ventilation systems may affect how much better (or worse) your Proposed case energy models perform in relation to your Baseline case energy models.

The following generic LEED Review Comment addresses energy recovery in EAc1 energy models as it relates to ventilation systems.

Energy recovery is modeled for credit in the Proposed case. Please provide further information regarding the energy recovery efficiency, verify that outside air is modeled with zero flow in both the Baseline and Proposed cases during unoccupied periods when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed Case), and indicate the bypass mechanism used to bypass the energy recovery during mild conditions.

I hope that helps, but if you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to use the contact form at http://www.gbci.org/contactus and select "Follow up to GBCI Response," inputting your case number from this email's subject line.

The text above represents a staff opinion of a particular issue, and does NOT set any precedent to be upheld during a LEED Certification Review. For official rulings in advance of a LEED Certification Review, customers should utilize the Formal Inquiries process available in LEED Online that results in a Project Credit Interpretation Ruling (Project CIR) and possibly a LEED Interpretation (formerly CIRs or Public Rulings). Applications for LEED Certification will be thoroughly reviewed based on USGBC Member balloted and approved LEED Rating Systems, with addenda, and USGBC approved LEED Interpretations, or Project CIRs administered by GBCI, as applicable. Please note that certain inquiries submitted to USGBC are forwarded to GBCI for reply as appropriate.

CUSTOMER INQUIRY:
I am trying to verify what the minimum outdoor airflow rate required for EAc1 is and am not sure if this requires a CIR.

If the Proposed outdoor air ventilation is a minimum of 30% higher than the minimum required by ASHRAE 62 in order to achieve 1 LEED point for credit IEQC2 is the Baseline outdoor air rate also 30% higher than the minimum required by ASHRAE 62? or would the Baseline outdoor air ventilation rate be the minimum outdoor air rate per ASHRAE 62 calculations.

In other words, if ASHRAE 62 requires a minimum of 1,000 CFM of outdoor air, and 1,300 CFM is provided to attain 1 LEED point via IEQC1, is the Baseline outdoor air flow rate 1,000 CFM or 1,300 CFM in the energy simulation?

90.1-2007/2004 both say the minimu    m outdoor airflow rates shall be the same for both the proposed and baseline building designs, as does the user manual.

But this logic seems to reward the Proposed simulation by conditioning the additional outdoor air supplied (300 cfm in the example above) to achieve IEQC1 in the Baseline system as well as the proposed.

The logic of using the minimum required in the Baseline case is reflected in EAC1 in the equipment efficiency requirements. Baseline efficiencies are the minimum required, e.g. SEER 13 for packaged units.

It is the intent of the requirement that I am not sure is clear. Increasing the outdoor air ventilation rate increases the energy used to condition the outdoor air, so if the intent is to put the onus on Proposed design to show energy reduction/LEED compliance over the 90.1/62 requirements shouldn't the Baseline outdoor air be the minimum air flow rate per the ASHRAE 62 calculations? This puts the onus on the design team to provide a design that compensates for the increase in energy to meet IEQC2 by providing some method of processing the increase in outdoor air while still reducing energy consumption.

My understanding is that for a 90.1-2007 outside air is modeled at the same CFM even if it's beyond ASHRAE 62.1 requirements with no energy penalty. However, this is no longer true in 90.1-2010 where the baseline is to follow ASRAE 62.1.

Also, I thought there was a ruling or interpretation to 62.1 that only allowed the elimination of the occupant portion of the ventilation to be shut off during unoccupied hours, but the area based outside air needs to be maintained at night to handle off-gassing.  I believe the 90.1 folks are still discussing how to incorporate this ruling into the standard.

If you don't have more DCV than the baseline, just use show in a calculation the total CFM and fraction of outside air for each AHU and show them the total is approximately the same. There is some latitude here for rounding errors and the like as some complex buildings may be off by a few percent. If your proposed outside cfm is slightly greater than your baseline outside cfm, then you should definitely be ok as your model will be conservative.

Hope that helps,

Ok, so I received this comment.  The one with the provide ASHRAE minimums in the Baseline for spaces with DCV.  I understand this is a generic comment - Ok.
However, LEED IEQ Credit 2 is not being pursued and the ASHRAE minimum ventilation requirements are what is being Proposed for in each space that has DCV.

Does this not mean that the Baseline ventilation rate and the Proposed ventilation rate will still be equal?
Not sure how to respond other than to simply say what is stated here.

Thanks,

I think this requirement comes from the mandatory provisions of 90.1.

6.4.3.4.3 Shutoff Damper Controls. Both outdoor
air supply and exhaust systems shall be equipped with motorized
dampers that will automatically shut when the systems or
spaces served are not in use. Ventilation outdoor air dampers
shall be capable of automatically shutting off during preoccupancy
building warm-up, cool down, and setback, except
when ventilation reduces energy costs (e.g., night purge) or
when ventilation must be supplied to meet code requirements.

Thoughts??

Dear Patrick,

Thank you for sharing this GBCI response!  It is very informative and, while I won't admit that I've been modeling anything incorrectly, I am going to change a couple of things :).
In particular, I have heard on several occasions that the Increased Ventilation credit was a clear case of "IEQ vs. energy"; you make a decision to trade one against the other.  After reading the GBCI response below and then double-checking with ASHRAE 90.1, I find that they are consistent with each other and effectively allow no penalty for the increased energy caused by increased ventilation.  Very curious, considering there is no science which demonstrates a health benefit for outdoor airflows greater than that required by ASHRAE 62.1!
The other item is that I failed to notice (and still can't find) anything in 621.1 which says that unoccupied ventilation should be zero.  I guess that is OK, but is also curious, since a portion of the ventilation calcs in 62.1 include consideration for off-gassing materials (which are always present.)
All in all, I'm smarter than I was as a result of your post, so it's a good day!  Thanks again.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] usgbc response to outdoor air question

back in september there was a thread about what the outdoor air rate in a baseline simulation should be compared to a proposed simulation, specifically when one is adding 30% more outdoor air to meet the ieqc2 requirement and earn 1 leed point.  there were differences of opinions about the flow rates between baseline and proposed being either the same (as required in 90.1 app g) or the baseline being the calculated per 62.1 and the proposed being as designed.

so i submitted a support request to the usgbc and the reply i received is below, but in short the response is that unless you're using dcv optionally the outdoor air rates in the baseline and proposed energy simulations for eac1 should be the same.  the response below gives the standard responses to differing outdoor air rate scenarios.

Dear Patrick,

Thank you for contacting the Green Building Certification Institute.

You ask very good questions related to the relationship between ASHRAE Standards 62.1 and 90.1, and how these standards are applied across multiple LEED Rating System prerequisites and credits.

The simple answer to your question is that, for systems without demand controlled ventilation, the outdoor air included in EA Credit 1 energy simulations must be the same in the Baseline and Proposed cases. If the project is attempting IEQ Credit 2 Increased Ventilation, then the values calculated in IEQc2 must be used in the EAc1 Basline and Proposed case energy models. Note that IEQc2 does not limit the project to providing only 30% more outdoor air than AHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate Procedure minimums, so higher amounts are acceptable, as long as they are modeled identically in both the Baseline and Proposed case energy models.

The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems that do not have demand controlled ventilation:

It is unclear whether the minimum outside air rates (in CFM) were modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case for all zones not having Demand Control Ventilation in the Proposed case. Please confirm that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed cases using the proposed case rates. Additionally, please verify that all systems in both the baseline and proposed case are modeled with zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case).

The situation becomes a bit more complicated in you have systems that have demand controlled ventilation (often implemented as Carbon Dioxide control of outdoor air or as programmed control of outdoor air based on occupancy sensors.) In this case the Baseline case energy model must include the minimum outdoor air as determined by the ASHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate Procedure calculations for all systems having demand controlled ventilation.

The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems that do have demand controlled ventilation:

Demand control ventilation was modeled for credit in the proposed case. Appendix G allows schedule changes for demand control ventilation as approved by the rating authority (Table G3.1#4(Baseline)). As the LEED Certification rating authority, GBCI requires that the outside air ventilation rates for the Baseline case be modeled using minimum ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or 2007 for LEED-NC 2009 projects) rates wherever credit is taken for demand control ventilation in the Proposed case. The proposed case minimum rates at design conditions should be modeled as designed. Please verify that the Baseline Case model reflects ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or 2007) minimum rates for any spaces where credit is taken for demand control ventilation, or revise the model accordingly. For all other spaces, please confirm that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed cases. Additionally, please verify that all systems in both the baseline and proposed cases are modeled with zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case).

Finally, even though you don't address energy recovery in your question, whether or not you have energy recovery in your ventilation systems may affect how much better (or worse) your Proposed case energy models perform in relation to your Baseline case energy models.

The following generic LEED Review Comment addresses energy recovery in EAc1 energy models as it relates to ventilation systems.

Energy recovery is modeled for credit in the Proposed case. Please provide further information regarding the energy recovery efficiency, verify that outside air is modeled with zero flow in both the Baseline and Proposed cases during unoccupied periods when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed Case), and indicate the bypass mechanism used to bypass the energy recovery during mild conditions.

I hope that helps, but if you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to use the contact form at http://www.gbci.org/contactus and select "Follow up to GBCI Response," inputting your case number from this email's subject line.

CUSTOMER INQUIRY:
I am trying to verify what the minimum outdoor airflow rate required for EAc1 is and am not sure if this requires a CIR.

If the Proposed outdoor air ventilation is a minimum of 30% higher than the minimum required by ASHRAE 62 in order to achieve 1 LEED point for credit IEQC2 is the Baseline outdoor air rate also 30% higher than the minimum required by ASHRAE 62? or would the Baseline outdoor air ventilation rate be the minimum outdoor air rate per ASHRAE 62 calculations.

In other words, if ASHRAE 62 requires a minimum of 1,000 CFM of outdoor air, and 1,300 CFM is provided to attain 1 LEED point via IEQC1, is the Baseline outdoor air flow rate 1,000 CFM or 1,300 CFM in the energy simulation?

90.1-2007/2004 both say the minimu    m outdoor airflow rates shall be the same for both the proposed and baseline building designs, as does the user manual.

But this logic seems to reward the Proposed simulation by conditioning the additional outdoor air supplied (300 cfm in the example above) to achieve IEQC1 in the Baseline system as well as the proposed.

The logic of using the minimum required in the Baseline case is reflected in EAC1 in the equipment efficiency requirements. Baseline efficiencies are the minimum required, e.g. SEER 13 for packaged units.

It is the intent of the requirement that I am not sure is clear. Increasing the outdoor air ventilation rate increases the energy used to condition the outdoor air, so if the intent is to put the onus on Proposed design to show energy reduction/LEED compliance over the 90.1/62 requirements shouldn't the Baseline outdoor air be the minimum air flow rate per the ASHRAE 62 calculations? This puts the onus on the design team to provide a design that compensates for the increase in energy to meet IEQC2 by providing some method of processing the increase in outdoor air while still reducing energy consumption.

ASHRAE 62.1-2010 may be viewed online for free from the ASHRAE website at:
https://www.ashrae.org/standards-research--technology/standards--guidelines.
 Its a little slow and painful to view and navigate since it is a free.

Also, all approved addenda may be downloaded in PDF from here:
https://www.ashrae.org/standards-research--technology/standards-addenda.

I reviewed both documents and did not see any rulings, interpretations or
addenda that would indicate that the area based portion of the ventilation
rate is required to operate 24/7 or during unoccupied periods.  If anyone
has a better resource than this please post.
Thanks,
Dennis

Hello  All,



Please see the following relevant quote from 62.1 2010:





To me this implies that all of the requirements in section 6 (which include
both the area and occupant components) are only applicable ?when [spaces]
are expected to be occupied?.

Mike

ASHRAE 62.1-2010 may be viewed online for free from the ASHRAE website at:

 Its a little slow and painful to view and navigate since it is a free.



Also, all approved addenda may be downloaded in PDF from here:
https://www.ashrae.org/standards-research--technology/standards-addenda.



I reviewed both documents and did not see any rulings, interpretations or
addenda that would indicate that the area based portion of the ventilation
rate is required to operate 24/7 or during unoccupied periods.  If anyone
has a better resource than this please post.

Thanks,

My understanding is that for a 90.1-2007 outside air is modeled at the same

However, this is no longer true in 90.1-2010 where the baseline is to
follow ASRAE 62.1.



Also, I thought there was a ruling or interpretation to 62.1 that only
allowed the elimination of the occupant portion of the ventilation to be
shut off during unoccupied hours, but the area based outside air needs to
be maintained at night to handle off-gassing.  I believe the 90.1 folks are
still discussing how to incorporate this ruling into the standard.



If you don?t have more DCV than the baseline, just use show in a
calculation the total CFM and fraction of outside air for each AHU and show
them the total is approximately the same. There is some latitude here for
rounding errors and the like as some complex buildings may be off by a few
percent. If your proposed outside cfm is slightly greater than your
baseline outside cfm, then you should definitely be ok as your model will
be conservative.



Hope that helps,



Fred

Ok, so I received this comment.  The one with the provide ASHRAE minimums
in the Baseline for spaces with DCV.  I understand this is a generic
comment - Ok.

However, LEED IEQ Credit 2 is not being pursued and the ASHRAE minimum
ventilation requirements are what is being Proposed for in each space that
has DCV.



Does this not mean that the Baseline ventilation rate and the Proposed
ventilation rate will still be equal?

Not sure how to respond other than to simply say what is stated here.

Dear Patrick,



Thank you for sharing this GBCI response!  It is very informative and,
while I won?t admit that I?ve been modeling anything incorrectly, I
*am*going to change a couple of things
J.

In particular, I have heard on several occasions that the Increased
Ventilation credit was a clear case of ?IEQ vs. energy?; you make a
decision to trade one against the other.  After reading the GBCI response
below and then double-checking with ASHRAE 90.1, I find that they are
consistent with each other and effectively allow no penalty for the
increased energy caused by increased ventilation.  Very curious,
considering there is no science which demonstrates a health benefit for
outdoor airflows greater than that required by ASHRAE 62.1!

The other item is that I failed to notice (and still can?t find) anything
in 621.1 which says that unoccupied ventilation should be zero.  I guess
that is OK, but is also curious, since a portion of the ventilation calcs
in 62.1 include consideration for off-gassing materials (which are always
present.)

All in all, I?m smarter than I was as a result of your post, so it?s a good
day!  Thanks again.

back in september there was a thread about what the outdoor air rate in a
baseline simulation should be compared to a proposed simulation,
specifically when one is adding 30% more outdoor air to meet the ieqc2
requirement and earn 1 leed point.  there were differences of opinions
about the flow rates between baseline and proposed being either the same
(as required in 90.1 app g) or the baseline being the calculated per 62.1
and the proposed being as designed.

so i submitted a support request to the usgbc and the reply i received is
below, but in short the response is that unless you're using dcv optionally
the outdoor air rates in the baseline and proposed energy simulations for
eac1 should be the same.  the response below gives the standard responses
to differing outdoor air rate scenarios.

Dear Patrick,

Thank you for contacting the Green Building Certification Institute.

You ask very good questions related to the relationship between ASHRAE
Standards 62.1 and 90.1, and how these standards are applied across
multiple LEED Rating System prerequisites and credits.

The simple answer to your question is that, for systems without demand
controlled ventilation, the outdoor air included in EA Credit 1 energy
simulations must be the same in the Baseline and Proposed cases. If the
project is attempting IEQ Credit 2 Increased Ventilation, then the values
calculated in IEQc2 must be used in the EAc1 Basline and Proposed case
energy models. Note that IEQc2 does not limit the project to providing only
30% more outdoor air than AHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate Procedure minimums,
so higher amounts are acceptable, as long as they are modeled identically
in both the Baseline and Proposed case energy models.

The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems
that do not have demand controlled ventilation:

It is unclear whether the minimum outside air rates (in CFM) were modeled
identically in the Baseline and Proposed case for all zones not having
Demand Control Ventilation in the Proposed case. Please confirm that
minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled identically in the
Baseline and Proposed cases using the proposed case rates. Additionally,
please verify that all systems in both the baseline and proposed case are
modeled with zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet
unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate
an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the
unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline
and Proposed case).

The situation becomes a bit more complicated in you have systems that have
demand controlled ventilation (often implemented as Carbon Dioxide control
of outdoor air or as programmed control of outdoor air based on occupancy
sensors.) In this case the Baseline case energy model must include the
minimum outdoor air as determined by the ASHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate
Procedure calculations for all systems having demand controlled
ventilation.

The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems
that do have demand controlled ventilation:

Demand control ventilation was modeled for credit in the proposed case.
Appendix G allows schedule changes for demand control ventilation as
approved by the rating authority (Table G3.1#4(Baseline)). As the LEED
Certification rating authority, GBCI requires that the outside air
ventilation rates for the Baseline case be modeled using minimum ASHRAE
62.1-2004 (or 2007 for LEED-NC 2009 projects) rates wherever credit is
taken for demand control ventilation in the Proposed case. The proposed
case minimum rates at design conditions should be modeled as designed.
Please verify that the Baseline Case model reflects ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or
2007) minimum rates for any spaces where credit is taken for demand control
ventilation, or revise the model accordingly. For all other spaces, please
confirm that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled
identically in the Baseline and Proposed cases. Additionally, please verify
that all systems in both the baseline and proposed cases are modeled with
zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback
temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate
minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied
outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and
Proposed case).

Finally, even though you don't address energy recovery in your question,
whether or not you have energy recovery in your ventilation systems may
affect how much better (or worse) your Proposed case energy models perform
in relation to your Baseline case energy models.

The following generic LEED Review Comment addresses energy recovery in EAc1
energy models as it relates to ventilation systems.

Energy recovery is modeled for credit in the Proposed case. Please provide
further information regarding the energy recovery efficiency, verify that
outside air is modeled with zero flow in both the Baseline and Proposed
cases during unoccupied periods when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied
setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an
alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the
unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline
and Proposed Case), and indicate the bypass mechanism used to bypass the
energy recovery during mild conditions.

I hope that helps, but if you have any further questions or concerns,

CUSTOMER EMAIL ADDRESS:

CUSTOMER INQUIRY:
I am trying to verify what the minimum outdoor airflow rate required for
EAc1 is and am not sure if this requires a CIR.

If the Proposed outdoor air ventilation is a minimum of 30% higher than the
minimum required by ASHRAE 62 in order to achieve 1 LEED point for credit
IEQC2 is the Baseline outdoor air rate also 30% higher than the minimum
required by ASHRAE 62? or would the Baseline outdoor air ventilation rate
be the minimum outdoor air rate per ASHRAE 62 calculations.

In other words, if ASHRAE 62 requires a minimum of 1,000 CFM of outdoor
air, and 1,300 CFM is provided to attain 1 LEED point via IEQC1, is the
Baseline outdoor air flow rate 1,000 CFM or 1,300 CFM in the energy
simulation?

90.1-2007/2004 both say the minimu    m outdoor airflow rates shall be the
same for both the proposed and baseline building designs, as does the user
manual.

But this logic seems to reward the Proposed simulation by conditioning the
additional outdoor air supplied (300 cfm in the example above) to achieve
IEQC1 in the Baseline system as well as the proposed.

The logic of using the minimum required in the Baseline case is reflected
in EAC1 in the equipment efficiency requirements. Baseline efficiencies are
the minimum required, e.g. SEER 13 for packaged units.

It is the intent of the requirement that I am not sure is clear. Increasing
the outdoor air ventilation rate increases the energy used to condition the
outdoor air, so if the intent is to put the onus on Proposed design to show
energy reduction/LEED compliance over the 90.1/62 requirements shouldn't
the Baseline outdoor air be the minimum air flow rate per the ASHRAE 62
calculations? This puts the onus on the design team to provide a design
that compensates for the increase in energy to meet IEQC2 by providing some
method of processing the increase in outdoor air while still reducing
energy consumption.

Dennis,
Attached is an interpretation from ASHRAE indicating the area based ventilation rate cannot be turned off during unoccupied hours (applicable to 2007 and 2010). Subsequently, ASHRAE is in the process of issuing an addendum that does allow the area based rate to be turned off based on occupancy controls. The addendum (also attached) went out for public review last spring. I don't see that it has been published on the ASHRAE website yet, so I'm not sure whether it has been fully approved by the committee yet.

Also, in my experience, LEED (v2009) requires that the baseline ventilation rate comply with the ASHRAE 62.1 minimum when DCV controls are implemented in the proposed design for spaces not required to have it per 90.1. This would be the only scenario where baseline ventilation rates differ from the proposed (i.e. no energy penalty for over ventilating). This changes for LEED v4 which used 90.1-2010.

Bill

If you don't have more DCV than the baseline, just use show in a calculation the total CFM and fraction of outside air for each AHU and show them the total is approximately the same. There is some latitude here for rounding errors and the like as some complex buildings may be off by a few percent. If your proposed outside cfm is slightly greater than your baseline outside cfm, then you should definitely be ok as your model will be conservative.

Hope that helps,

Ok, so I received this comment.  The one with the provide ASHRAE minimums in the Baseline for spaces with DCV.  I understand this is a generic comment - Ok.
However, LEED IEQ Credit 2 is not being pursued and the ASHRAE minimum ventilation requirements are what is being Proposed for in each space that has DCV.

Does this not mean that the Baseline ventilation rate and the Proposed ventilation rate will still be equal?
Not sure how to respond other than to simply say what is stated here.

I think this requirement comes from the mandatory provisions of 90.1.

6.4.3.4.3 Shutoff Damper Controls. Both outdoor
air supply and exhaust systems shall be equipped with motorized
dampers that will automatically shut when the systems or
spaces served are not in use. Ventilation outdoor air dampers
shall be capable of automatically shutting off during preoccupancy
building warm-up, cool down, and setback, except
when ventilation reduces energy costs (e.g., night purge) or
when ventilation must be supplied to meet code requirements.

Thoughts??

Dear Patrick,

Thank you for sharing this GBCI response!  It is very informative and, while I won't admit that I've been modeling anything incorrectly, I am going to change a couple of things :).
In particular, I have heard on several occasions that the Increased Ventilation credit was a clear case of "IEQ vs. energy"; you make a decision to trade one against the other.  After reading the GBCI response below and then double-checking with ASHRAE 90.1, I find that they are consistent with each other and effectively allow no penalty for the increased energy caused by increased ventilation.  Very curious, considering there is no science which demonstrates a health benefit for outdoor airflows greater than that required by ASHRAE 62.1!
The other item is that I failed to notice (and still can't find) anything in 621.1 which says that unoccupied ventilation should be zero.  I guess that is OK, but is also curious, since a portion of the ventilation calcs in 62.1 include consideration for off-gassing materials (which are always present.)
All in all, I'm smarter than I was as a result of your post, so it's a good day!  Thanks again.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] usgbc response to outdoor air question

back in september there was a thread about what the outdoor air rate in a baseline simulation should be compared to a proposed simulation, specifically when one is adding 30% more outdoor air to meet the ieqc2 requirement and earn 1 leed point.  there were differences of opinions about the flow rates between baseline and proposed being either the same (as required in 90.1 app g) or the baseline being the calculated per 62.1 and the proposed being as designed.

so i submitted a support request to the usgbc and the reply i received is below, but in short the response is that unless you're using dcv optionally the outdoor air rates in the baseline and proposed energy simulations for eac1 should be the same.  the response below gives the standard responses to differing outdoor air rate scenarios.

Dear Patrick,

Thank you for contacting the Green Building Certification Institute.

You ask very good questions related to the relationship between ASHRAE Standards 62.1 and 90.1, and how these standards are applied across multiple LEED Rating System prerequisites and credits.

The simple answer to your question is that, for systems without demand controlled ventilation, the outdoor air included in EA Credit 1 energy simulations must be the same in the Baseline and Proposed cases. If the project is attempting IEQ Credit 2 Increased Ventilation, then the values calculated in IEQc2 must be used in the EAc1 Basline and Proposed case energy models. Note that IEQc2 does not limit the project to providing only 30% more outdoor air than AHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate Procedure minimums, so higher amounts are acceptable, as long as they are modeled identically in both the Baseline and Proposed case energy models.

The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems that do not have demand controlled ventilation:

It is unclear whether the minimum outside air rates (in CFM) were modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case for all zones not having Demand Control Ventilation in the Proposed case. Please confirm that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed cases using the proposed case rates. Additionally, please verify that all systems in both the baseline and proposed case are modeled with zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case).

The situation becomes a bit more complicated in you have systems that have demand controlled ventilation (often implemented as Carbon Dioxide control of outdoor air or as programmed control of outdoor air based on occupancy sensors.) In this case the Baseline case energy model must include the minimum outdoor air as determined by the ASHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate Procedure calculations for all systems having demand controlled ventilation.

The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems that do have demand controlled ventilation:

Demand control ventilation was modeled for credit in the proposed case. Appendix G allows schedule changes for demand control ventilation as approved by the rating authority (Table G3.1#4(Baseline)). As the LEED Certification rating authority, GBCI requires that the outside air ventilation rates for the Baseline case be modeled using minimum ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or 2007 for LEED-NC 2009 projects) rates wherever credit is taken for demand control ventilation in the Proposed case. The proposed case minimum rates at design conditions should be modeled as designed. Please verify that the Baseline Case model reflects ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or 2007) minimum rates for any spaces where credit is taken for demand control ventilation, or revise the model accordingly. For all other spaces, please confirm that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed cases. Additionally, please verify that all systems in both the baseline and proposed cases are modeled with zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case).

Finally, even though you don't address energy recovery in your question, whether or not you have energy recovery in your ventilation systems may affect how much better (or worse) your Proposed case energy models perform in relation to your Baseline case energy models.

The following generic LEED Review Comment addresses energy recovery in EAc1 energy models as it relates to ventilation systems.

Energy recovery is modeled for credit in the Proposed case. Please provide further information regarding the energy recovery efficiency, verify that outside air is modeled with zero flow in both the Baseline and Proposed cases during unoccupied periods when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed Case), and indicate the bypass mechanism used to bypass the energy recovery during mild conditions.

I hope that helps, but if you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to use the contact form at http://www.gbci.org/contactus and select "Follow up to GBCI Response," inputting your case number from this email's subject line.

CUSTOMER INQUIRY:
I am trying to verify what the minimum outdoor airflow rate required for EAc1 is and am not sure if this requires a CIR.

If the Proposed outdoor air ventilation is a minimum of 30% higher than the minimum required by ASHRAE 62 in order to achieve 1 LEED point for credit IEQC2 is the Baseline outdoor air rate also 30% higher than the minimum required by ASHRAE 62? or would the Baseline outdoor air ventilation rate be the minimum outdoor air rate per ASHRAE 62 calculations.

In other words, if ASHRAE 62 requires a minimum of 1,000 CFM of outdoor air, and 1,300 CFM is provided to attain 1 LEED point via IEQC1, is the Baseline outdoor air flow rate 1,000 CFM or 1,300 CFM in the energy simulation?

90.1-2007/2004 both say the minimu    m outdoor airflow rates shall be the same for both the proposed and baseline building designs, as does the user manual.

But this logic seems to reward the Proposed simulation by conditioning the additional outdoor air supplied (300 cfm in the example above) to achieve IEQC1 in the Baseline system as well as the proposed.

The logic of using the minimum required in the Baseline case is reflected in EAC1 in the equipment efficiency requirements. Baseline efficiencies are the minimum required, e.g. SEER 13 for packaged units.

It is the intent of the requirement that I am not sure is clear. Increasing the outdoor air ventilation rate increases the energy used to condition the outdoor air, so if the intent is to put the onus on Proposed design to show energy reduction/LEED compliance over the 90.1/62 requirements shouldn't the Baseline outdoor air be the minimum air flow rate per the ASHRAE 62 calculations? This puts the onus on the design team to provide a design that compensates for the increase in energy to meet IEQC2 by providing some method of processing the increase in outdoor air while still reducing energy consumption.

the total CFM and fraction of outside air for each AHU and show them the
total is approximately the same. There is some latitude here for rounding
errors and the like as some complex buildings may be off by a few percent.
If your proposed outside cfm is slightly greater than your baseline outside
cfm, then you should definitely be ok as your model will be conservative. 

 

Hope that helps,

 

Fred

Ok, so I received this comment.  The one with the provide ASHRAE minimums in
the Baseline for spaces with DCV.  I understand this is a generic comment -
Ok.  

However, LEED IEQ Credit 2 is not being pursued and the ASHRAE minimum
ventilation requirements are what is being Proposed for in each space that
has DCV.  

 

Does this not mean that the Baseline ventilation rate and the Proposed
ventilation rate will still be equal?

Not sure how to respond other than to simply say what is stated here.

 

Thanks,

I think this requirement comes from the mandatory provisions of 90.1.

 

6.4.3.4.3 Shutoff Damper Controls. Both outdoor

air supply and exhaust systems shall be equipped with motorized

dampers that will automatically shut when the systems or

spaces served are not in use. Ventilation outdoor air dampers

shall be capable of automatically shutting off during preoccupancy

building warm-up, cool down, and setback, except

when ventilation reduces energy costs (e.g., night purge) or

when ventilation must be supplied to meet code requirements.

Dear Patrick,

 

Thank you for sharing this GBCI response!  It is very informative and, while
I won't admit that I've been modeling anything incorrectly, I am going to
change a couple of things J.

In particular, I have heard on several occasions that the Increased
Ventilation credit was a clear case of "IEQ vs. energy"; you make a decision
to trade one against the other.  After reading the GBCI response below and
then double-checking with ASHRAE 90.1, I find that they are consistent with
each other and effectively allow no penalty for the increased energy caused
by increased ventilation.  Very curious, considering there is no science
which demonstrates a health benefit for outdoor airflows greater than that
required by ASHRAE 62.1!

The other item is that I failed to notice (and still can't find) anything in
621.1 which says that unoccupied ventilation should be zero.  I guess that
is OK, but is also curious, since a portion of the ventilation calcs in 62.1
include consideration for off-gassing materials (which are always present.)

All in all, I'm smarter than I was as a result of your post, so it's a good
day!  Thanks again.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] usgbc response to outdoor air question

 

back in september there was a thread about what the outdoor air rate in a
baseline simulation should be compared to a proposed simulation,
specifically when one is adding 30% more outdoor air to meet the ieqc2
requirement and earn 1 leed point.  there were differences of opinions about
the flow rates between baseline and proposed being either the same (as
required in 90.1 app g) or the baseline being the calculated per 62.1 and
the proposed being as designed.

so i submitted a support request to the usgbc and the reply i received is
below, but in short the response is that unless you're using dcv optionally
the outdoor air rates in the baseline and proposed energy simulations for
eac1 should be the same.  the response below gives the standard responses to
differing outdoor air rate scenarios.

Dear Patrick,

Thank you for contacting the Green Building Certification Institute. 

You ask very good questions related to the relationship between ASHRAE
Standards 62.1 and 90.1, and how these standards are applied across multiple
LEED Rating System prerequisites and credits.

The simple answer to your question is that, for systems without demand
controlled ventilation, the outdoor air included in EA Credit 1 energy
simulations must be the same in the Baseline and Proposed cases. If the
project is attempting IEQ Credit 2 Increased Ventilation, then the values
calculated in IEQc2 must be used in the EAc1 Basline and Proposed case
energy models. Note that IEQc2 does not limit the project to providing only
30% more outdoor air than AHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate Procedure minimums, so
higher amounts are acceptable, as long as they are modeled identically in
both the Baseline and Proposed case energy models.

The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems
that do not have demand controlled ventilation:

It is unclear whether the minimum outside air rates (in CFM) were modeled
identically in the Baseline and Proposed case for all zones not having
Demand Control Ventilation in the Proposed case. Please confirm that minimum
outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled identically in the Baseline
and Proposed cases using the proposed case rates. Additionally, please
verify that all systems in both the baseline and proposed case are modeled
with zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied
setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an
alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the
unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline
and Proposed case).

The situation becomes a bit more complicated in you have systems that have
demand controlled ventilation (often implemented as Carbon Dioxide control
of outdoor air or as programmed control of outdoor air based on occupancy
sensors.) In this case the Baseline case energy model must include the
minimum outdoor air as determined by the ASHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate
Procedure calculations for all systems having demand controlled ventilation.


The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems
that do have demand controlled ventilation:

Demand control ventilation was modeled for credit in the proposed case.
Appendix G allows schedule changes for demand control ventilation as
approved by the rating authority (Table G3.1#4(Baseline)). As the LEED
Certification rating authority, GBCI requires that the outside air
ventilation rates for the Baseline case be modeled using minimum ASHRAE
62.1-2004 (or 2007 for LEED-NC 2009 projects) rates wherever credit is taken
for demand control ventilation in the Proposed case. The proposed case
minimum rates at design conditions should be modeled as designed. Please
verify that the Baseline Case model reflects ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or 2007)
minimum rates for any spaces where credit is taken for demand control
ventilation, or revise the model accordingly. For all other spaces, please
confirm that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled
identically in the Baseline and Proposed cases. Additionally, please verify
that all systems in both the baseline and proposed cases are modeled with
zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback
temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate
minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied
outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed
case).

Finally, even though you don't address energy recovery in your question,
whether or not you have energy recovery in your ventilation systems may
affect how much better (or worse) your Proposed case energy models perform
in relation to your Baseline case energy models. 

The following generic LEED Review Comment addresses energy recovery in EAc1
energy models as it relates to ventilation systems.

Energy recovery is modeled for credit in the Proposed case. Please provide
further information regarding the energy recovery efficiency, verify that
outside air is modeled with zero flow in both the Baseline and Proposed
cases during unoccupied periods when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied
setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an
alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the
unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline
and Proposed Case), and indicate the bypass mechanism used to bypass the
energy recovery during mild conditions. 

I hope that helps, but if you have any further questions or concerns, please

CUSTOMER EMAIL ADDRESS:

CUSTOMER INQUIRY:
I am trying to verify what the minimum outdoor airflow rate required for
EAc1 is and am not sure if this requires a CIR. 

If the Proposed outdoor air ventilation is a minimum of 30% higher than the
minimum required by ASHRAE 62 in order to achieve 1 LEED point for credit
IEQC2 is the Baseline outdoor air rate also 30% higher than the minimum
required by ASHRAE 62? or would the Baseline outdoor air ventilation rate be
the minimum outdoor air rate per ASHRAE 62 calculations. 

In other words, if ASHRAE 62 requires a minimum of 1,000 CFM of outdoor air,
and 1,300 CFM is provided to attain 1 LEED point via IEQC1, is the Baseline
outdoor air flow rate 1,000 CFM or 1,300 CFM in the energy simulation? 

90.1-2007/2004 both say the minimu    m outdoor airflow rates shall be the
same for both the proposed and baseline building designs, as does the user
manual. 

But this logic seems to reward the Proposed simulation by conditioning the
additional outdoor air supplied (300 cfm in the example above) to achieve
IEQC1 in the Baseline system as well as the proposed. 

The logic of using the minimum required in the Baseline case is reflected in
EAC1 in the equipment efficiency requirements. Baseline efficiencies are the
minimum required, e.g. SEER 13 for packaged units. 

It is the intent of the requirement that I am not sure is clear. Increasing
the outdoor air ventilation rate increases the energy used to condition the
outdoor air, so if the intent is to put the onus on Proposed design to show
energy reduction/LEED compliance over the 90.1/62 requirements shouldn't the
Baseline outdoor air be the minimum air flow rate per the ASHRAE 62
calculations? This puts the onus on the design team to provide a design that
compensates for the increase in energy to meet IEQC2 by providing some
method of processing the increase in outdoor air while still reducing energy
consumption.

Let me go ahead and confuse things further: IEQp1 requires that:

" Mechanical ventilation systems must be designed using the ventilation rate procedure as defined by ASHRAE 62.1-2007, or the applicable local code, whichever is more stringent."

So if your project is in a state that has adopted 62.1-2010 (such as OH) , then that is the standard you should be referencing. Which addenda you apply is at your discretion.

90.1 is very insistent that unless a building is intended to operate 24hrs a day, the system should not be running when the building is not occupied. I take that as what is intended by the phrase "expected to be occupied". The control on individual spaces on occupancy while the whole building is in occupied mode would be a separate matter where I can understand wanting to cover the area component.

I guess I've never heard anyone push the idea that building types such as schools or libraries should be ventilated 24hrs a day so that makes me a bit skeptical of a interpretation that would lead down that path.

Dennis,
Attached is an interpretation from ASHRAE indicating the area based ventilation rate cannot be turned off during unoccupied hours (applicable to 2007 and 2010). Subsequently, ASHRAE is in the process of issuing an addendum that does allow the area based rate to be turned off based on occupancy controls. The addendum (also attached) went out for public review last spring. I don't see that it has been published on the ASHRAE website yet, so I'm not sure whether it has been fully approved by the committee yet.

Also, in my experience, LEED (v2009) requires that the baseline ventilation rate comply with the ASHRAE 62.1 minimum when DCV controls are implemented in the proposed design for spaces not required to have it per 90.1. This would be the only scenario where baseline ventilation rates differ from the proposed (i.e. no energy penalty for over ventilating). This changes for LEED v4 which used 90.1-2010.

Bill

ASHRAE 62.1-2010 may be viewed online for free from the ASHRAE website at: https://www.ashrae.org/standards-research--technology/standards--guidelines.  Its a little slow and painful to view and navigate since it is a free.

Also, all approved addenda may be downloaded in PDF from here: https://www.ashrae.org/standards-research--technology/standards-addenda.

I reviewed both documents and did not see any rulings, interpretations or addenda that would indicate that the area based portion of the ventilation rate is required to operate 24/7 or during unoccupied periods.  If anyone has a better resource than this please post.

Also, I thought there was a ruling or interpretation to 62.1 that only allowed the elimination of the occupant portion of the ventilation to be shut off during unoccupied hours, but the area based outside air needs to be maintained at night to handle off-gassing.  I believe the 90.1 folks are still discussing how to incorporate this ruling into the standard.

If you don't have more DCV than the baseline, just use show in a calculation the total CFM and fraction of outside air for each AHU and show them the total is approximately the same. There is some latitude here for rounding errors and the like as some complex buildings may be off by a few percent.

Ok, so I received this comment.  The one with the provide ASHRAE minimums in the Baseline for spaces with DCV.  I understand this is a generic comment - Ok.
However, LEED IEQ Credit 2 is not being pursued and the ASHRAE minimum ventilation requirements are what is being Proposed for in each space that has DCV.

Does this not mean that the Baseline ventilation rate and the Proposed ventilation rate will still be equal?
Not sure how to respond other than to simply say what is stated here.

The other item is that I failed to notice (and still can't find) anything in 621.1 which says that unoccupied ventilation should be zero.  I guess that is OK, but is also curious, since a portion of the ventilation calcs in 62.1 include consideration for off-gassing materials (which are always present.)
All in all, I'm smarter than I was as a result of your post, so it's a good day!  Thanks again.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] usgbc response to outdoor air question

back in september there was a thread about what the outdoor air rate in a baseline simulation should be compared to a proposed simulation, specifically when one is adding 30% more outdoor air to meet the ieqc2 requirement and earn 1 leed point.  there were differences of opinions about the flow rates between baseline and proposed being either the same (as required in 90.1 app g) or the baseline being the calculated per 62.1 and the proposed being as designed.

so i submitted a support request to the usgbc and the reply i received is below, but in short the response is that unless you're using dcv optionally the outdoor air rates in the baseline and proposed energy simulations for eac1 should be the same.  the response below gives the standard responses to differing outdoor air rate scenarios.

Dear Patrick,

Thank you for contacting the Green Building Certification Institute.

You ask very good questions related to the relationship between ASHRAE Standards 62.1 and 90.1, and how these standards are applied across multiple LEED Rating System prerequisites and credits.

The simple answer to your question is that, for systems without demand controlled ventilation, the outdoor air included in EA Credit 1 energy simulations must be the same in the Baseline and Proposed cases. If the project is attempting IEQ Credit 2 Increased Ventilation, then the values calculated in IEQc2 must be used in the EAc1 Basline and Proposed case energy models. Note that IEQc2 does not limit the project to providing only 30% more outdoor air than AHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate Procedure minimums, so higher amounts are acceptable, as long as they are modeled identically in both the Baseline and Proposed case energy models.

The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems that do not have demand controlled ventilation:

It is unclear whether the minimum outside air rates (in CFM) were modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case for all zones not having Demand Control Ventilation in the Proposed case. Please confirm that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed cases using the proposed case rates. Additionally, please verify that all systems in both the baseline and proposed case are modeled with zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case).

The situation becomes a bit more complicated in you have systems that have demand controlled ventilation (often implemented as Carbon Dioxide control of outdoor air or as programmed control of outdoor air based on occupancy sensors.) In this case the Baseline case energy model must include the minimum outdoor air as determined by the ASHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate Procedure calculations for all systems having demand controlled ventilation.

The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems that do have demand controlled ventilation:

Demand control ventilation was modeled for credit in the proposed case. Appendix G allows schedule changes for demand control ventilation as approved by the rating authority (Table G3.1#4(Baseline)). As the LEED Certification rating authority, GBCI requires that the outside air ventilation rates for the Baseline case be modeled using minimum ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or 2007 for LEED-NC 2009 projects) rates wherever credit is taken for demand control ventilation in the Proposed case. The proposed case minimum rates at design conditions should be modeled as designed. Please verify that the Baseline Case model reflects ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or 2007) minimum rates for any spaces where credit is taken for demand control ventilation, or revise the model accordingly. For all other spaces, please confirm that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed cases. Additionally, please verify that all systems in both the baseline and proposed cases are modeled with zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case).

Finally, even though you don't address energy recovery in your question, whether or not you have energy recovery in your ventilation systems may affect how much better (or worse) your Proposed case energy models perform in relation to your Baseline case energy models.

The following generic LEED Review Comment addresses energy recovery in EAc1 energy models as it relates to ventilation systems.

Energy recovery is modeled for credit in the Proposed case. Please provide further information regarding the energy recovery efficiency, verify that outside air is modeled with zero flow in both the Baseline and Proposed cases during unoccupied periods when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed Case), and indicate the bypass mechanism used to bypass the energy recovery during mild conditions.

I hope that helps, but if you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to use the contact form at http://www.gbci.org/contactus and select "Follow up to GBCI Response," inputting your case number from this email's subject line.

CUSTOMER INQUIRY:
I am trying to verify what the minimum outdoor airflow rate required for EAc1 is and am not sure if this requires a CIR.

If the Proposed outdoor air ventilation is a minimum of 30% higher than the minimum required by ASHRAE 62 in order to achieve 1 LEED point for credit IEQC2 is the Baseline outdoor air rate also 30% higher than the minimum required by ASHRAE 62? or would the Baseline outdoor air ventilation rate be the minimum outdoor air rate per ASHRAE 62 calculations.

In other words, if ASHRAE 62 requires a minimum of 1,000 CFM of outdoor air, and 1,300 CFM is provided to attain 1 LEED point via IEQC1, is the Baseline outdoor air flow rate 1,000 CFM or 1,300 CFM in the energy simulation?

90.1-2007/2004 both say the minimu    m outdoor airflow rates shall be the same for both the proposed and baseline building designs, as does the user manual.

But this logic seems to reward the Proposed simulation by conditioning the additional outdoor air supplied (300 cfm in the example above) to achieve IEQC1 in the Baseline system as well as the proposed.

The logic of using the minimum required in the Baseline case is reflected in EAC1 in the equipment efficiency requirements. Baseline efficiencies are the minimum required, e.g. SEER 13 for packaged units.

It is the intent of the requirement that I am not sure is clear. Increasing the outdoor air ventilation rate increases the energy used to condition the outdoor air, so if the intent is to put the onus on Proposed design to show energy reduction/LEED compliance over the 90.1/62 requirements shouldn't the Baseline outdoor air be the minimum air flow rate per the ASHRAE 62 calculations? This puts the onus on the design team to provide a design that compensates for the increase in energy to meet IEQC2 by providing some method of processing the increase in outdoor air while still reducing energy consumption.

Philip:  One clarification - the energy code and 62.1 don?t decide if the HVAC system needs to run to provide heating or cooling. Bill?s excerpt states that if the HVAC system is going to operate due to heating/cooling/schedule, then you have to maintain at least the area component of the ventilation air. As he mentions pertaining to the proposed addendum, it seems to make sense to many of us that if occupancy is zero then the outside air might also be zero during that time, even for the area component. Otherwise why would you be allowed to turn the unit off?

Your laboratory case might also have ventilation due to contaminants to consider which could supersede the 62.1 area component pretty easily anyway. Food storage is a different issue. First off, you might need to decide if the space is really an occupied space and does ASHRAE 62.1 apply, or if it is unoccupied storage. (Still conditioned!) Obviously the temperature/humidity requirements of the food, would determine if the HVAC system runs all of the time or not.

Brendan:  Not sure about discretionary ? most building codes or similar regulations will (must?) be absolute ? requiring use of the standard as issued on a certain date, or including all addendums as of the current date. LEED is one of the few exceptions that allows the designer to choose whether to use an addendum or not, and skip over intermediate addenda. So if the local code was more stringent than LEED (even for a more recent version of the same ASHRAE standard) it might not be discretionary? I?m not sure about Ohio?s specific requirements, maybe they do allow discretion.

Question, in a school or facility that contains aquariums, food goods or anything that has a storage temperature limit less than or equal to outdoor air temperature is there not allowance for this?

A high school science lab in phoenix for example simply cannot be left without ventilation or cooling on a 105?F evening occupied or not.

Subject: Re: [Equest-users] [Bldg-rate] [Bldg-sim] usgbc response to outdoor air question

Let me go ahead and confuse things further: IEQp1 requires that:

? Mechanical ventilation systems must be designed using the ventilation rate procedure as defined by ASHRAE 62.1-2007, or the applicable local code, whichever is more stringent.?

So if your project is in a state that has adopted 62.1-2010 (such as OH) , then that is the standard you should be referencing. Which addenda you apply is at your discretion.

90.1 is very insistent that unless a building is intended to operate 24hrs a day, the system should not be running when the building is not occupied. I take that as what is intended by the phrase ?expected to be occupied?. The control on individual spaces on occupancy while the whole building is in occupied mode would be a separate matter where I can understand wanting to cover the area component.

I guess I?ve never heard anyone push the idea that building types such as schools or libraries should be ventilated 24hrs a day so that makes me a bit skeptical of a interpretation that would lead down that path.

Subject: Re: [Equest-users] [Bldg-rate] [Bldg-sim] usgbc response to outdoor air question

Dennis,
Attached is an interpretation from ASHRAE indicating the area based ventilation rate cannot be turned off during unoccupied hours (applicable to 2007 and 2010). Subsequently, ASHRAE is in the process of issuing an addendum that does allow the area based rate to be turned off based on occupancy controls. The addendum (also attached) went out for public review last spring. I don?t see that it has been published on the ASHRAE website yet, so I?m not sure whether it has been fully approved by the committee yet.

Also, in my experience, LEED (v2009) requires that the baseline ventilation rate comply with the ASHRAE 62.1 minimum when DCV controls are implemented in the proposed design for spaces not required to have it per 90.1. This would be the only scenario where baseline ventilation rates differ from the proposed (i.e. no energy penalty for over ventilating). This changes for LEED v4 which used 90.1-2010.

Bill

ASHRAE 62.1-2010 may be viewed online for free from the ASHRAE website at: https://www.ashrae.org/standards-research--technology/standards--guidelines.  Its a little slow and painful to view and navigate since it is a free.

Also, all approved addenda may be downloaded in PDF from here: https://www.ashrae.org/standards-research--technology/standards-addenda.

I reviewed both documents and did not see any rulings, interpretations or addenda that would indicate that the area based portion of the ventilation rate is required to operate 24/7 or during unoccupied periods.  If anyone has a better resource than this please post.
Thanks,
Dennis

My understanding is that for a 90.1-2007 outside air is modeled at the same CFM even if it?s beyond ASHRAE 62.1 requirements with no energy penalty. However, this is no longer true in 90.1-2010 where the baseline is to follow ASRAE 62.1.

Also, I thought there was a ruling or interpretation to 62.1 that only allowed the elimination of the occupant portion of the ventilation to be shut off during unoccupied hours, but the area based outside air needs to be maintained at night to handle off-gassing.  I believe the 90.1 folks are still discussing how to incorporate this ruling into the standard.

If you don?t have more DCV than the baseline, just use show in a calculation the total CFM and fraction of outside air for each AHU and show them the total is approximately the same. There is some latitude here for rounding errors and the like as some complex buildings may be off by a few percent. If your proposed outside cfm is slightly greater than your baseline outside cfm, then you should definitely be ok as your model will be conservative.

Hope that helps,

Ok, so I received this comment.  The one with the provide ASHRAE minimums in the Baseline for spaces with DCV.  I understand this is a generic comment - Ok.
However, LEED IEQ Credit 2 is not being pursued and the ASHRAE minimum ventilation requirements are what is being Proposed for in each space that has DCV.

Does this not mean that the Baseline ventilation rate and the Proposed ventilation rate will still be equal?
Not sure how to respond other than to simply say what is stated here.

I think this requirement comes from the mandatory provisions of 90.1.

6.4.3.4.3 Shutoff Damper Controls. Both outdoor
air supply and exhaust systems shall be equipped with motorized
dampers that will automatically shut when the systems or
spaces served are not in use. Ventilation outdoor air dampers
shall be capable of automatically shutting off during preoccupancy

when ventilation reduces energy costs (e.g., night purge) or
when ventilation must be supplied to meet code requirements.

Dear Patrick,

Thank you for sharing this GBCI response!  It is very informative and, while I won?t admit that I?ve been modeling anything incorrectly, I am going to change a couple of things ?.
In particular, I have heard on several occasions that the Increased Ventilation credit was a clear case of ?IEQ vs. energy?; you make a decision to trade one against the other.  After reading the GBCI response below and then double-checking with ASHRAE 90.1, I find that they are consistent with each other and effectively allow no penalty for the increased energy caused by increased ventilation.  Very curious, considering there is no science which demonstrates a health benefit for outdoor airflows greater than that required by ASHRAE 62.1!
The other item is that I failed to notice (and still can?t find) anything in 621.1 which says that unoccupied ventilation should be zero.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] usgbc response to outdoor air question

back in september there was a thread about what the outdoor air rate in a baseline simulation should be compared to a proposed simulation, specifically when one is adding 30% more outdoor air to meet the ieqc2 requirement and earn 1 leed point.  there were differences of opinions about the flow rates between baseline and proposed being either the same (as required in 90.1 app g) or the baseline being the calculated per 62.1 and the proposed being as designed.

so i submitted a support request to the usgbc and the reply i received is below, but in short the response is that unless you're using dcv optionally the outdoor air rates in the baseline and proposed energy simulations for eac1 should be the same.  the response below gives the standard responses to differing outdoor air rate scenarios.

patrick

Dear Patrick,

Thank you for contacting the Green Building Certification Institute.

You ask very good questions related to the relationship between ASHRAE Standards 62.1 and 90.1, and how these standards are applied across multiple LEED Rating System prerequisites and credits.

The simple answer to your question is that, for systems without demand controlled ventilation, the outdoor air included in EA Credit 1 energy simulations must be the same in the Baseline and Proposed cases. If the project is attempting IEQ Credit 2 Increased Ventilation, then the values calculated in IEQc2 must be used in the EAc1 Basline and Proposed case energy models. Note that IEQc2 does not limit the project to providing only 30% more outdoor air than AHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate Procedure minimums, so higher amounts are acceptable, as long as they are modeled identically in both the Baseline and Proposed case energy models.

The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems that do not have demand controlled ventilation:

It is unclear whether the minimum outside air rates (in CFM) were modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case for all zones not having Demand Control Ventilation in the Proposed case. Please confirm that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed cases using the proposed case rates. Additionally, please verify that all systems in both the baseline and proposed case are modeled with zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case).

The situation becomes a bit more complicated in you have systems that have demand controlled ventilation (often implemented as Carbon Dioxide control of outdoor air or as programmed control of outdoor air based on occupancy sensors.) In this case the Baseline case energy model must include the minimum outdoor air as determined by the ASHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate Procedure calculations for all systems having demand controlled ventilation.

The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems that do have demand controlled ventilation:

Demand control ventilation was modeled for credit in the proposed case. Appendix G allows schedule changes for demand control ventilation as approved by the rating authority (Table G3.1#4(Baseline)). As the LEED Certification rating authority, GBCI requires that the outside air ventilation rates for the Baseline case be modeled using minimum ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or 2007 for LEED-NC 2009 projects) rates wherever credit is taken for demand control ventilation in the Proposed case. The proposed case minimum rates at design conditions should be modeled as designed. Please verify that the Baseline Case model reflects ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or 2007) minimum rates for any spaces where credit is taken for demand control ventilation, or revise the model accordingly. For all other spaces, please confirm that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed cases. Additionally, please verify that all systems in both the baseline and proposed cases are modeled with zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case).

Finally, even though you don't address energy recovery in your question, whether or not you have energy recovery in your ventilation systems may affect how much better (or worse) your Proposed case energy models perform in relation to your Baseline case energy models.

The following generic LEED Review Comment addresses energy recovery in EAc1 energy models as it relates to ventilation systems.

Energy recovery is modeled for credit in the Proposed case. Please provide further information regarding the energy recovery efficiency, verify that outside air is modeled with zero flow in both the Baseline and Proposed cases during unoccupied periods when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed Case), and indicate the bypass mechanism used to bypass the energy recovery during mild conditions.

I hope that helps, but if you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to use the contact form at http://www.gbci.org/contactus and select "Follow up to GBCI Response," inputting your case number from this email's subject line.

The text above represents a staff opinion of a particular issue, and does NOT set any precedent to be upheld during a LEED Certification Review. For official rulings in advance of a LEED Certification Review, customers should utilize the Formal Inquiries process available in LEED Online that results in a Project Credit Interpretation Ruling (Project CIR) and possibly a LEED Interpretation (formerly CIRs or Public Rulings). Applications for LEED Certification will be thoroughly reviewed based on USGBC Member balloted and approved LEED Rating Systems, with addenda, and USGBC approved LEED Interpretations, or Project CIRs administered by GBCI, as applicable.

CUSTOMER INQUIRY:
I am trying to verify what the minimum outdoor airflow rate required for EAc1 is and am not sure if this requires a CIR.

If the Proposed outdoor air ventilation is a minimum of 30% higher than the minimum required by ASHRAE 62 in order to achieve 1 LEED point for credit IEQC2 is the Baseline outdoor air rate also 30% higher than the minimum required by ASHRAE 62? or would the Baseline outdoor air ventilation rate be the minimum outdoor air rate per ASHRAE 62 calculations.

In other words, if ASHRAE 62 requires a minimum of 1,000 CFM of outdoor air, and 1,300 CFM is provided to attain 1 LEED point via IEQC1, is the Baseline outdoor air flow rate 1,000 CFM or 1,300 CFM in the energy simulation?

90.1-2007/2004 both say the minimu    m outdoor airflow rates shall be the same for both the proposed and baseline building designs, as does the user manual.

But this logic seems to reward the Proposed simulation by conditioning the additional outdoor air supplied (300 cfm in the example above) to achieve IEQC1 in the Baseline system as well as the proposed.

The logic of using the minimum required in the Baseline case is reflected in EAC1 in the equipment efficiency requirements. Baseline efficiencies are the minimum required, e.g. SEER 13 for packaged units.

It is the intent of the requirement that I am not sure is clear. Increasing the outdoor air ventilation rate increases the energy used to condition the outdoor air, so if the intent is to put the onus on Proposed design to show energy reduction/LEED compliance over the 90.1/62 requirements shouldn't the Baseline outdoor air be the minimum air flow rate per the ASHRAE 62 calculations? This puts the onus on the design team to provide a design that compensates for the increase in energy to meet IEQC2 by providing some method of processing the increase in outdoor air while still reducing energy consumption.

Message-ID: <CABqehi45EYE7CQ2e9cayXQMppbCW+fDq9pZBkFyQvkr2SEG5SQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I was trying to predict the chiller set points with the help of DOE -
2 equations. I was able to obtain the coefficients and I used EIRFT to
predict the optimal set point to be maintained in the chiller. I tried
to calculate it back from predicted EIR. Is it the right way to do?.
Can you please explain me as to how we can predict the optimal set
point for chillers. I have been trying a lot to predict the set points
and have read a paper on Model Predictive control of HVAC systems in
UC merced campus but I am not clear on the algorithms which they have
used to predict the set points. I have attached the excel sheet in
this mail. Please help me in predicting the set points.

Thanks a lot for helping me out.

Message-ID: <CAB_-mWO1GvzpPyt0ZBOujPcq6RqiJJ8iBdgcBpt-vWJYdoOSXA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am building (and simulating) a zero energy renovation project (www.zehr.be).
We apply a bunch of new technologies, that will be measured.

My contractor has sent a team if Polish workers, who speak French as well.
It works really well, but I want to explain them the concept of passive and
zero energy buildings by providing a text in their mother tongue.

I have found bits and pieces on blower door testing (even on desalination
of old walls), but have no clue where to find a practice-oriented handbook
or website in Polish.

Can anyone guide me (my Polish is limited to the name of tools, yes and
no, and the polite good morning)?

Leen (and the construction team)

G'day,

This is the first time I have posted a question  on the list and I am after some feedback for a particular project / case study I am working on.

Using the 'simple model' developed by the Canadian Presevartion Council would I be calculating sufficiently accurately the embodied energy and the energy losses from demolition for a large civic hall masonry building in central Victoria Australia?

Thanks any feedback is appreciated.

There was a discussion a few months back on the EnergyPlus_Support bulletin board on 
F-factors that you might be interested to read (go back to April 24-25).  Here is what I 
had posted at that time:

-----
Jean, others,

It was quite a surprise to read your e-mail and find that the old F-Factors that I 
calculated back in 1988 are still being referred to in Standard 90.1.  If you're 
interested in more details of that effort, there's an ASHRAE Transaction paper

Huang, Y.J., L.S. Shen, J.C. Bull, and L.F. Goldberg 1988. "Whole-house simulation of 
foundation heat-flows using the DOE-2 program", /ASHRAE Transactions/, Vol. 94-2.

and a 1998 User News article written by Fred Winkelmann on its implementation in DOE-2 ( 
http://www.whiteboxtechnologies.com/PAPERS/Fdn_modeling_user_news_articles02-2.pdf )

The F-Factors are per lineal feet of perimeter from Tout to Tin of the space containing 
the foundation. There are actually several ways to implement this model: (1) model a 
monolithic foundation as an exterior wall and adjust the R-value of the layer so that  U*A 
= F*PL (Perimeter length) -- this is the method shown in the Winkelmann article,  (2) 
decompose the foundation into two regions - a perimeter strip 1-2 ft wide and a core for 
the remainder; model the perimeter as an exterior wall, adjusting its R-value accordingly, 
but model the core as an adiabatic layer.  When I was working with DOE-2, there was a 
practical problem that layers can't be too thick or the response factor would fail, so I 
could only add at most 2.5 ft of soil. I don't know if EnergyPlus has similar 
limitations.  Ideally, you would want to model as much soil as possible to get the thermal 
dampening effect.

The main deficiencies with this technique are (1) Tout is the outside air temperature, (2) 
the foundation is treated as a single layer.  I know there's a temptation to model the 
foundation as a underground layer tied to the soil temperature, but that would be wrong 
since the F-Factors were calculated air-to-air.

In the late 90's (1998-2000), I worked with Fred Winkelmann and Vladimir Bazjanac for the 
Calif. Energy Commission to develop what I think is a much better model that is now the 
approved method for Title-24. This model uses a similar approach as before,  except 
instead of a single F-Factor, there are six Foundation Conductances for two domains 
(perimeter and core) and three heat flow paths ("quick" to the outdoor air temperature the 
past 3 weeks, "slow" to the  monthly ground temperature, and "constant" to the deep ground 
temperature). The model is not only more accurate, but  more flexible for different 
building conditions. If anyone's interested in the report, it's available at 
www.whiteboxtechnologies.com/downloads/00_02.YJH.CEC_Fdn_Model.pdf

If I have it in my power, I would urge everyone to stop using the 1988 model and switch to 
the 2000 model, but since the F-Factors seem to have been institutionalized by now, that 
would be irresponsible. So, I'll be happy to answer questions about the use of either model.

Joe - on this topic:

I was involved with a string of large footprint facilities in cavern spaces, where the floors and ceilings were effectively un-insulated limestone, far underground.  For the purpose of determining building loads to size equipment, we were able to make a set of comfortable assumptions with respect to the surrounding air conditions and perimeter losses, but the challenge of determining an appropriate constant heat loss through the substantial rock floor/ceiling surfaces proved an uncertain venture.

Deciding the extent to which those losses should slow (or not) over time as the conditioned facility warms up the surrounding earth further complicated some comparative ROI assessments for conditioning equipment options.

In hindsight (and having not yet absorbed the linked literature), this more nuanced 2000 era approach which separately addresses the perimeter and core losses seems like a great stride towards addressing such concerns.  In advance of familiarizing myself with this approach, are you aware of any publicly available tools/software packages utilizing this method that could be leveraged for load calculations in a similar scenario?  Would you suggest a different approach?

I've said this before but not nearly as often as it crossed my mind:  thank you for your ever-helpful contributions!

~Nick

I use EnergyPro for LEED.  It can do either CA T-24 or 90.1 and is 
accepted by USGBC.  From what I can tell, it can be used in CA or 
elsewhere.  EnergySoft has a new module which provides pdf files which 
appear to be identical to the new LEED forms.  I'm not sure that the 
module has been released yet, but I have been allowed to use it.  The 
forms printed out automatically are precisely identical to the LEED 
forms requirements.  I have copied Martyn Dodd of EnergySoft on this post.

Martyn has told me that USGBC will accept the EnergyPro forms as 
submittals for LEED certification and I am doing that now with an 
apartment building that I am working on.  He is copied on this post.

Hello ,

I am reading Fanger book for thermal comfort, I have some issues in example
14 , i am not getting the point that what is Fp - a ..... How this
numerical has been solved .. Any help will be appreciated..

2) how the dynamic changeof different factors , radiant asymmtery are
influencing the determination of thermal comfort?

I have expanded the question.

 

Is there information on the use of energy programs (EnergyPlus, eQUEST,
TRACE, HAP, IESVE, TRNSYS, etc.) used for code compliance and LEED
certification? 

Is there statistical information comparing the predicted energy usage by
these energy programs and actual energy consumption measured on site? 

Does code authorities and LEED USGBC check energy program predictions
against actual usage?

 

With Building Management Systems, the computer can record the actual energy
use and a program can show the deviation from predicted.  Sub-metering will
show energy use of components (CHW, HW & AHU systems, etc.)

If you agree to monitor the building under EAc5, "Measurement and

I think Dr. Ugursal can help with this as his thesis investigated several of these topics.

I am reading Fanger book for thermal comfort, I have some issues in example 14 , i am not getting the point that what is Fp - a ..... How this numerical has been solved .. Any help will be appreciated..

2) how the dynamic changeof different factors , radiant asymmtery are influencing the determination of thermal comfort?

Increasing transportation and building energy use is not going to save the

The population of America is about 300 million, Europe's (Western, Eastern,
and Russia) is about 700 million, and in Japan and Korea it is about 200
million.  There are about another 800 million in the rest of the world
(China, India, Brazil, etc.) with same standard of living.  This represents
less than 30% of the world's population of 7,000 million.  However, this 30%
use almost all of the earth's resources and is responsible for almost all of
the industrial pollution and global warming.  

 

There is no population growth in the 30% segment of the population with a
high (energy wasting) standard of living, but their energy use per capita is
escalating at faster rate than the population which is escalating at an
alarming rate.  If the other 70% population were to reach the same standard
of living as the energy wasters and polluters (the 30% segment) we would
have to consider "Global Heating".   Standard of living might curb
population growth but it results in escalating energy use and atmospheric
pollution.

 

Industrial pollution would make life impossible on this planet if the other
70% of the world's population (which is escalating) were to reach the living
standards of the existing 30%.  Industrial pollution is not the main threat.
At the present rate of human population growth, forests, vegetation, and
most large animal life will be devastated in a few hundred years.  This has
happened in the past as with the dinosaurs.  

 

Uncontrolled human population growth has destroyed forests and vegetation.
It is responsible for destroying animal life as well, particularly the large
mammals that require large amounts of forest and grassland to survive.
Tigers, lions, elephants, giraffes, rhinos and hippos are going join
dinosaurs as interesting science education in schools.  Humans will soon be
competing for space on this planet only with rats, cockroaches, flies, and
insects.  History has shown that the smaller creature will win.

Message-ID: <421439FA9B193547A80AA924D0A041903996A114@SVKJWWMAIL2.ad.kjww.com>

All, I have an ASHRAE 90.1-2007 question that I've run into while completing an energy model.

ASHRAE 90.1-2007 section 6.4.3.9 is a mandatory provision for demand control ventilation in densely occupied zones.

Exception 9.4.3.9(a) reads, "Systems with energy recovery complying with Section 6.5.6.1."

6.5.6.1. Exhaust Air Energy Recovery. Individual fan systems that have both a design supply air capacity of 5000 cfm or greater and have a minimum outdoor air supply of 70% or greater of the design supply air quantity shall have an energy recovery system with at least 50% recovery effectiveness. Fifty percent energy recovery effectiveness shall mean a change in the enthalpy of the outdoor air supply equal to 50% of the difference between the outdoor air and the return air at design conditions. Provision shall be made to bypass or control the heat recovery system to permit air economizer operation as required by Section 6.5.1.1.

My question: If I have a system that's only 20% outside air but complies with the remainder of 6.5.6.1, can I still use exception 9.4.3.9(a) to avoid DCV in densely occupied zones? Or does that exception only apply to those systems with 70% OA or more?

Thank you!

Stormy,

By my reading of exception 6.4.3.9(a) and 6.5.6.1, you can avoid the DCV requirement if you have a system with energy recovery that has 50% recovery effectiveness and that has bypass/control to permit economizer operation. The 5000 cfm & 70% OA (>3500 cfm OA) are the Prescriptive Path criteria for requiring energy recovery, and don't align with 6.4.3.9, which applies for systems with >3000 cfm OA. The wording in 90.1-2010 for 6.5.6.1 makes this more clear, IMO.

Bill

Varkie,

Yes.
We need to make "standard of living" distinct from energy intensity. Carbon diets all around.
Being a stickler for numbers (and having researched this for a Climate Change presentation I'm doing next week) I modified and added to your table, using data from this website<http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/>. Population growth has been nearly linear over the past 30 to 40 years and is expected to level off at 10 bn.

Hi Gang:
?
I need to elite for this one, and you know who you are..
?
I am reviewing another party's eQuest model submitted for LEED. The reviewer noted that the roof area far exceeded the actual building footprint.
?
Well, guess why? Somehow, the other party made several floors ROOFS instead of ceilings. I might be able to simply turn the exterior spaces into interior ceilings, but one roof (over an unheated underground garage) is partially uder the building and partially exposed to the "sidewalk/entrance" of the building.
?
The BIG Kahuena is this..if a space is crammed next to an adjacent space and one of the spaces claims an Exterioir surface between them, does DOE-2 think that Exterior surface is seeing outdoor conditions? Or does it ignore such a thin and merely considers the heat transfer between the spaces (like the wall/roof is NOT exposed to the outdoors)?
?
My approach is this (unless you disagree)..leave the Exterior wall/roof along and explain that the model (now in Detailed Edit form) would need major surgery to correct to show actual roof area. Having the "roofs" there versus floors will not change the thermodynamics of heat transfer.
?
I yield to the floor.
?

this sounds like you have multiple shells in one model for this to 
occur?  i'm pretty sure equest views an exterior wall/roof as an 
exterior wall/roof even if it is bounded by an interior wall.  i had 
this problem come up on one of my own models where i ended up having a 
building wing meet the building trunk & as i had put them in as 2 
separate shells equest did not recognize the dividing wall where the 
wing met the trunk as being an interior wall & assigned it (via the 
wizard) an exterior wall definition.  i didn't catch this until 
reviewing the unmet load hour ss-r & s-va reports & couldn't figure out 
why the load was so high.  changed the definition of the wall to 
interior (with a door) in detailed mode and the unmet load hours went to 
zero and the load came down.

my understanding (in my case) is that if you create multiple shells and 
place them with a common wall that you want to be an interior the shell 
rotations need to be zero, even if you have the separation between the 
two shells occur at a 45 deg angle (then ask mr. architect about that one).

in clearing my doubts and helping me.

1) How to compute and make analysis for index using typical values for
measurement uncertainties .... ( I am confused from where to start how to
take the typical values for measurement...?)

2) how to calculate the angle factor for a person sitting by desk ,  ???

John,

 

Having extra exterior roof area is a fairly common mistake in eQUEST models
involving multiple shells. It typically originates on DD Wizard Screen 3,
when roof construction is specified in the Construction list box for a shell
that has no roof (i.e. shell that includes only the middle floors of the
building), instead of setting it to "-no exterior exposure (adiabatic)".
Any exterior surface in eQUEST will conduct heat between the parent space
and the ambient, even if it is adjacent to another conditioned space based
on 3D view, so having extra roof area does affect simulation results. The
easiest way to fix the problem is to delete the extra exterior roof
surfaces. Converting them to interior walls as Patrick suggested is a more
precise approach, but is also more time consuming and will have negligible
impact on results for most projects, especially if the result of interest is
Appendix G performance rating. 

 

Thanks,

 

Maria

this sounds like you have multiple shells in one model for this to occur?
i'm pretty sure equest views an exterior wall/roof as an exterior wall/roof
even if it is bounded by an interior wall.  i had this problem come up on
one of my own models where i ended up having a building wing meet the
building trunk & as i had put them in as 2 separate shells equest did not
recognize the dividing wall where the wing met the trunk as being an
interior wall & assigned it (via the wizard) an exterior wall definition.  i
didn't catch this until reviewing the unmet load hour ss-r & s-va reports &
couldn't figure out why the load was so high.  changed the definition of the
wall to interior (with a door) in detailed mode and the unmet load hours
went to zero and the load came down.

my understanding (in my case) is that if you create multiple shells and
place them with a common wall that you want to be an interior the shell
rotations need to be zero, even if you have the separation between the two
shells occur at a 45 deg angle (then ask mr. architect about that one).

I am reviewing another party's eQuest model submitted for LEED. The reviewer
noted that the roof area far exceeded the actual building footprint.

 

Well, guess why? Somehow, the other party made several floors ROOFS instead
of ceilings. I might be able to simply turn the exterior spaces into
interior ceilings, but one roof (over an unheated underground garage) is
partially uder the building and partially exposed to the "sidewalk/entrance"
of the building.

 

The BIG Kahuena is this..if a space is crammed next to an adjacent space and
one of the spaces claims an Exterioir surface between them, does DOE-2 think
that Exterior surface is seeing outdoor conditions? Or does it ignore such a
thin and merely considers the heat transfer between the spaces (like the
wall/roof is NOT exposed to the outdoors)?

 

My approach is this (unless you disagree)..leave the Exterior wall/roof
along and explain that the model (now in Detailed Edit form) would need
major surgery to correct to show actual roof area. Having the "roofs" there
versus floors will not change the thermodynamics of heat transfer.

 

I yield to the floor.

If you did opt for conversion, it is probably easier to do so in the INP file than detailed interface.

Adding a bunch of ceilings will also require matching floors for "adjacent-to" surfaces - just deleting sounds easier.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Above Grade External Wall Area Weighted U-value
	Calculation
Message-ID: <026e01cebd31$6c76df60$45649e20$@gmail.com>

Dear All,

I have submitted a project for review and received a comment requesting me
to include the concrete slabs between floors (Not drop beams) in the
External Wall' area weighted U-value calculation, the reviewer believes that
concrete slabs acts as a thermal bridge and should be insulated from the
outer side (The slab thickness), my understanding that concrete slab
shouldn't be regarded as a part of the occupied area and therefore shouldn't
be included in the area weighted U-value calculation.

I would appreciate if you can advise on the above query!

Thanks & Best Regards,

Here are a few more thoughts (gathered in haste because I'm traveling, but on my mind for a while)

*         Humans have clearly mis-managed every resource on the planet - occasionally.

*         As Bill notes, global population is leveling.  Almost every Western country is now below its population rate and is experiencing population decline.  China's population growth has been forced by law to decline for years, Europe is in a particularly sad state, the US is buoyed by immigrants' generally higher rate of having children and even historically high growth groups like Muslims are seeing significantly slowed growth.

*         Humans have (through creativity, ingenuity and need) created a host of technologies and processes that would have been considered black magic only 100 years ago - and have been doing this throughout history.  Their pluses outweigh the minuses dramatically over the course of history!

*         Reduce population and you reduce the amazing and consistent impact of human creativity!  (and while we're at it, consider how you are going to remain part of the powerful group that decides who lives and who dies - it seems to be primarily an exercise of the powerful against those who lack it.  The "Haves" against the "Have-nots".  I don't think it's a simple matter!)

*         There is ample evidence that the worries about "overpopulation" are a myth.  The advocates are well-funded myth promoters (and perhaps power-grabbers), but do not have science substantiating them.  See http://overpopulationisamyth.com/overpopulation-the-making-of-a-myth for some teasers on this topic.

*         "Global warming", which in recent years has become "climate change", seems to be in a similarly unsubstantiated position.  It's easy to find many scientific arguments against human-caused climate change (with many credible supporters), and very few IPCC or other climate change advocates who can refute their challenges.  (See http://petitionproject.org/gw_article/Review_Article_HTML.php for a detailed summary.) A short summary of concerns about climate change might be:

o   Is the global temperature changing? (Yes, as it has throughout history)

o   Is the change bad for humans?  (Maybe. Higher temperatures and associated higher CO2 levels promote plant growth - great for food production!  Greenland used to be ... green during a previous warm period!)

o   Are humans causing climate change? (some evidence says "yes", some says "insignificantly", some says "probably not". The historical data shows that global CO2  levels follow global temperature rise .. by hundreds of years.  How could it be that a following effect causes the first?)

o   Do we know how to reduce the rate of change? (I haven't read the Kyoto Protocol, but it's supposed to have predicted a global temperature reduction of a few hundredths of a degree C if every first world nation adopted its measures.  Not too impressive and not consistent with global cooling in the last decade or so despite increasing CO2 production. I wonder what the uncertainty of that model was?? We all know about the accuracy of "models"!)

*         All of that said, I am not a climate scientist.  I am an engineer who looks for facts, trends and logic.  Most of what I see and read in the population and climate change discussions is "Trust me, I have the support of a big government-funded project", or ad hominem (look it up!) rebuttals.  Since when has science been a "consensus"?  It's a good thing Galileo and Newton and Einstein didn't conduct research by consensus! If the facts are really on your side, they'll stand up to scrutiny.  I'd love to hear a reasoned debate by knowledgeable people on both sides of these issues, but one of the sides seems curiously un-inclined to debate....

*         P.s., I am also the father of seven children who has marveled at the amazing diversity of insight and talent among my own family.  The potential of children is proven and holds incredible promise for all the rest of us.  It's impossible to predict what they might do, but history demonstrates clearly that they consistently outperform expectations!

Varkie,

Yes.
We need to make "standard of living" distinct from energy intensity. Carbon diets all around.
Being a stickler for numbers (and having researched this for a Climate Change presentation I'm doing next week) I modified and added to your table, using data from this website<http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/>. Population growth has been nearly linear over the past 30 to 40 years and is expected to level off at 10 bn.

The population of America is about 300 million, Europe's (Western, Eastern, and Russia) is about 700 million, and in Japan and Korea it is about 200 million.  There are about another 800 million in the rest of the world (China, India, Brazil, etc.) with same standard of living.  This represents less than 30% of the world's population of 7,000 million.  However, this 30% use almost all of the earth's resources and is responsible for almost all of the industrial pollution and global warming.



There is no population growth in the 30% segment of the population with a high (energy wasting) standard of living, but their energy use per capita is escalating at faster rate than the population which is escalating at an alarming rate.  If the other 70% population were to reach the same standard of living as the energy wasters and polluters (the 30% segment) we would have to consider "Global Heating".   Standard of living might curb population growth but it results in escalating energy use and atmospheric pollution.



Industrial pollution would make life impossible on this planet if the other 70% of the world's population (which is escalating) were to reach the living standards of the existing 30%.  Industrial pollution is not the main threat.  At the present rate of human population growth, forests, vegetation, and most large animal life will be devastated in a few hundred years.  This has happened in the past as with the dinosaurs.



Uncontrolled human population growth has destroyed forests and vegetation.  It is responsible for destroying animal life as well, particularly the large mammals that require large amounts of forest and grassland to survive.  Tigers, lions, elephants, giraffes, rhinos and hippos are going join dinosaurs as interesting science education in schools.  Humans will soon be competing for space on this planet only with rats, cockroaches, flies, and insects.  History has shown that the smaller creature will win.

John,

I can comment only on the DOE-2 side of things.  When you say "one of 
the spaces claims an Exterior surface between them",  you must mean just 
by geometrical
proximity, not explicitly with a "NEXT-TO" command ?   Because as far as 
I'm aware, only an INTERIOR-WALL can have a NEXT-TO command.  If these 
roofs are specified as EXTERIOR-WALLs or ROOFs (the only difference is 
the default TILT), they can't have a NEXT-TO and will be modeled as 
exposed to the exterior environment, including solar.  Self-shading from 
other exterior-walls will be considered only if those are specified as 
shading surfaces (though I've forgotten exactly how that's done 
SHADING-SURFACE = YES ?).

What the reviewer said is technically correct, but not often done in 
simple UA calculations because of the difficulty is calculating U-values 
for such thermal bridging.
The effects can be substantial, especially for heavy-mass concrete 
construction. I've seen in China there's a standard method to account 
for thermal bridging in calculating wall U-values. Have not seen a 
similar technique for the US, don't know about the situation in Europe.

Varkie,

I'm going to say something that might rankle others on this bulletin board.
The main take-away I get from your post (but something I've felt all along),
is that in respect to energy efficiency and carbon mitigation, the developed
countries are still the source of the problem, and not the solution (at 
least
not yet).  Therefore, those of us working in green buildings, building 
energy
efficiency, etc., should still maintain a healthy dose of humility and 
not have
that air of moral superiority I often detect at international conferences.

Varkie,

Yes.
We need to make "standard of living" distinct from energy intensity. Carbon diets all around.
Being a stickler for numbers (and having researched this for a Climate Change presentation I'm doing next week) I modified and added to your table, using data from this website<http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/>. Population growth has been nearly linear over the past 30 to 40 years and is expected to level off at 10 bn.

Increasing transportation and building energy use is not going to save the planet.
It requires controlling the human population growth.

The population of America is about 300 million, Europe's (Western, Eastern, and Russia) is about 700 million, and in Japan and Korea it is about 200 million.  There are about another 800 million in the rest of the world (China, India, Brazil, etc.) with same standard of living.  This represents less than 30% of the world's population of 7,000 million.  However, this 30% use almost all of the earth's resources and is responsible for almost all of the industrial pollution and global warming.



There is no population growth in the 30% segment of the population with a high (energy wasting) standard of living, but their energy use per capita is escalating at faster rate than the population which is escalating at an alarming rate.  If the other 70% population were to reach the same standard of living as the energy wasters and polluters (the 30% segment) we would have to consider "Global Heating".   Standard of living might curb population growth but it results in escalating energy use and atmospheric pollution.



Industrial pollution would make life impossible on this planet if the other 70% of the world's population (which is escalating) were to reach the living standards of the existing 30%.  Industrial pollution is not the main threat.  At the present rate of human population growth, forests, vegetation, and most large animal life will be devastated in a few hundred years.  This has happened in the past as with the dinosaurs.



Uncontrolled human population growth has destroyed forests and vegetation.  It is responsible for destroying animal life as well, particularly the large mammals that require large amounts of forest and grassland to survive.  Tigers, lions, elephants, giraffes, rhinos and hippos are going join dinosaurs as interesting science education in schools.  Humans will soon be competing for space on this planet only with rats, cockroaches, flies, and insects.  History has shown that the smaller creature will win.

If the "roofs" don't have a zone as the outside boundary condition, then
the model views them as roofs exposed to the exterior.  You need to fix
this. If the spaces on the other side have the same thermostat setpoints,
then the easiest thing to do is set the roof type to "adiabatic". This will
save you from having to define new polygons if the floor above has
different zone shapes.  For a roof that is only partially covered by the
floor above, you need to create the new polygons. Sorry.

	Calculation
Message-ID: <CAA_BVWQZj5Ow=xjw+R4UU4LRjtfVDjGitvubp1-rBN4scbMEWg@mail.gmail.com>

ISO has a standard methodology for accounting for thermal bridging as
described in ISO 10221 and it is a standard part of using the ISO 13790
methodology for heating/cooling calculations.  ASHRAE has researched a
similar method which is described in ASHRAE Research Project 1365-RP
?Thermal Performance of Building Envelope Details for Mid- and High-Rise
Buildings?   I don't know if this is going to lead to an ASHRAE standard or
not.

That said, the ISO method is not a US standard and doesn't have ANSI or
ASHRAE equivalents,  Further,  I don't know of any specific code/energy
standard requirements to use the ISO standard.

Agreed, make the change in the .inp file for the appropriate shells.

It helps to give the incorrect roofs a different construction so you can search them more easily. Also, save a copy of the .inp file before making your edits. I?ve found it?s too easy to make a mistake in the .inp file that corrupts the whole model.

It is unfortunately a very common mistake in the wizard that is a pain to fix in the detailed mode, but that?s the best way I know how to correct the problem.

If you did opt for conversion, it is probably easier to do so in the INP file than detailed interface.

Adding a bunch of ceilings will also require matching floors for "adjacent-to" surfaces - just deleting sounds easier.

John,

Having extra exterior roof area is a fairly common mistake in eQUEST models involving multiple shells. It typically originates on DD Wizard Screen 3, when roof construction is specified in the Construction list box for a shell that has no roof (i.e. shell that includes only the middle floors of the building), instead of setting it to ?-no exterior exposure (adiabatic)?.  Any exterior surface in eQUEST will conduct heat between the parent space and the ambient, even if it is adjacent to another conditioned space based on 3D view, so having extra roof area does affect simulation results. The easiest way to fix the problem is to delete the extra exterior roof surfaces. Converting them to interior walls as Patrick suggested is a more precise approach, but is also more time consuming and will have negligible impact on results for most projects, especially if the result of interest is Appendix G performance rating.

Thanks,

Maria

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Really need some deep DOE-2 theology on this one..

this sounds like you have multiple shells in one model for this to occur?  i'm pretty sure equest views an exterior wall/roof as an exterior wall/roof even if it is bounded by an interior wall.  i had this problem come up on one of my own models where i ended up having a building wing meet the building trunk & as i had put them in as 2 separate shells equest did not recognize the dividing wall where the wing met the trunk as being an interior wall & assigned it (via the wizard) an exterior wall definition.  i didn't catch this until reviewing the unmet load hour ss-r & s-va reports & couldn't figure out why the load was so high.  changed the definition of the wall to interior (with a door) in detailed mode and the unmet load hours went to zero and the load came down.

my understanding (in my case) is that if you create multiple shells and place them with a common wall that you want to be an interior the shell rotations need to be zero, even if you have the separation between the two shells occur at a 45 deg angle (then ask mr. architect about that one).

Hi Gang:

I need to elite for this one, and you know who you are..

I am reviewing another party's eQuest model submitted for LEED. The reviewer noted that the roof area far exceeded the actual building footprint.

Well, guess why? Somehow, the other party made several floors ROOFS instead of ceilings. I might be able to simply turn the exterior spaces into interior ceilings, but one roof (over an unheated underground garage) is partially uder the building and partially exposed to the "sidewalk/entrance" of the building.

The BIG Kahuena is this..if a space is crammed next to an adjacent space and one of the spaces claims an Exterioir surface between them, does DOE-2 think that Exterior surface is seeing outdoor conditions? Or does it ignore such a thin and merely considers the heat transfer between the spaces (like the wall/roof is NOT exposed to the outdoors)?

My approach is this (unless you disagree)..leave the Exterior wall/roof along and explain that the model (now in Detailed Edit form) would need major surgery to correct to show actual roof area. Having the "roofs" there versus floors will not change the thermodynamics of heat transfer.

I yield to the floor.

It isn't like the reviewer is making things up, I think it is pretty clear from the language of 90.1 Appendix G that you have to account for these exposed slab edges. Frankly 90.1-2007 is a little more forgiving, allowing for area-weighted U-factors for the entire wall, I believe previous versions of Appendix G (2004 for example) actually specifically required that you model uninsulated assemblies as their own discrete wall types. See excerpts below:

ASHARE 90.1-2007 Appendix G:
[cid:image002.png at 01CEBDBC.188EDC00]

ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G:
[cid:image006.jpg at 01CEBDBC.188EDC00]
We usually model the slab edges as separate walls (only about 1 foot high) and make the other walls "shorter" when you take out this area. If you don't do this in the wizard, you can set up a macro in the .inp to to it, but it takes a bit of work. Frankly if you already have the model set up without slab areas, it seems much easier to to do the weighted U-factor calculation.

Dear All,
I have submitted a project for review and received a comment requesting me to include the concrete slabs between floors (Not drop beams) in the External Wall' area weighted U-value calculation, the reviewer believes that concrete slabs acts as a thermal bridge and should be insulated from the outer side (The slab thickness), my understanding that concrete slab shouldn't be regarded as a part of the occupied area and therefore shouldn't be included in the area weighted U-value calculation.
I would appreciate if you can advise on the above query!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] eQUEST packaged VAV systems
Message-ID: <CACbt1qGa-nwcDE9yd-BkUeys1OCmRw6HLQkWmw793W0xmDjaVQ@mail.gmail.com>

We're modeling a big box retail store with PSZ systems. We'd like to
determine the savings associated with installing a packaged vav system.
We're having a hard time getting the central heating (furnace) activated
with this system type in eQUEST. We have set the HEAT-SET-T to 95 and
included a heating capacity value. We do not have any zone reheat.  In
cooling mode, we'd like the  DX supply flow to decrease first. In heating
mode, we'd like the supply flow to also decrease first.

We have single zone systems and are not really using these system types

Just to clarify, we can't get the furnace working with either the PVAVS or
the PVVT. Also tried with electric as the system heating source with both
systems with no success.

Dear All,
               in my baseline model the chiller is centrifugal type . Now as per ashrae protocol we have to consider VFD in secondary pumps as well as AHU for system 8 . but if my chiller is centrifugal whether i have to consider VFD in chiller also for baseline model?

Message-ID: <1378232058.67630.YahooMailNeo@web163606.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Apologies if off-topic, but perhaps someone with HVAC experience in this arena can provide some insights off-line.


-------------

I recently vacated my house due to mold contamination. Problems were extensive in subfloor and crawlspace. Kitchen and several bathrooms had to be gutted. Remediation is now complete, and remodeling nearing completion. House has an??American Standard AUD100R9V5K4? Ser #8235NSX1G?forced air furnace, and no cooling system (located in Colorado). The system is 100% recirc, with no humidifier. We have kept the furnace, but replaced all ducts to eliminate concern of mold spore contamination. All interior surfaces of building have been 'treated', and all personal belongings removed.?Unfortunately, we have learned that sometimes even dead mold spores can linger (clinging to surfaces, etc), and if inhaled by a sensitive occupant (that's me), can then induce recurrence of health problems.?

Question: What would be the best way to introduce high quality filtration to this system? (At this point, targets include spores, pollen, and even chemicals off-gassing from new materials).?
Obvious options would seem to include:?

- high Merv-rating filters in existing furnace
- 'sidecar' HEPA / Activated charcoal unit on the CAR (a good option, but doesn't treat 100% of the air)
- UV has fallen out of favor since we don't have a cooling coil to point it at, and not sure what other surface would be appropriate
- Electric / ionizing systems have fallen out of favor due to ozone conerns
- Could fabricate a deck in the CAR just upstream of furnace to receive a HEPA filter, and suffer the fan energy penalty in exchange for additional filtration confidence.
- Not sure what to make of stand-alone Activated Charcoal filters -- seems like they need to be discharged frequently. True?
- Another option would be to go with just the MERV filter in the furnace, then purchase mobile stand-alone HEPA / Charcoal units for main rooms of each floor. More local control, but more noise.
- Are there other options we're missing?

Note:
- We are well aware of benefits of OA in such situations, but there are complications with high smoke and ozone days in this region, so 100% will actually be desirable at times -- and night flushing is a common strategy when conditions allow. Also, the house is 115yrs old, so infiltration is significant anyway.?
- HRV would obviously come into play if we pursue an OA configuration, but when filtration requirements are added, we're concerned about complexity of system.

Has anyone gone through this type of exercise? Comments / suggestions welcome.?

Regards,

Adam

ASHRAE/IBPSA-USA Building Simulation Conference Announced

ATLANTA ?ASHRAE and IBPSA-USA have announced a joint conference that merges the IBPSA-USA SimBuild and ASHRAE Energy Modeling Conferences.

The joint conference, entitled 2014 ASHRAE/IBPSA-USA Building Simulation Conference, Sept. 10-12, 2014, Atlanta, Ga., currently has a call for papers.

?This conference is a first for the industry, and we?re excited about the benefits it can bring to the building energy analysis and performance simulation community,? Dennis Knight, Conference chair, said.  The conference seeks to improve the industry?s ability to accurately model building performance.

Modelers, software developers, owners and researchers will address the practices of energy modeling and building performance simulation using existing simulation tools, software development, and future simulation research and applications.

The conference is focusing on "BIM, BEM and SIM ? Integrated Building Design and Modeling,? addressing building information modeling, building energy modeling and building simulation.

?The most pressing need facing modelers is transferring data between tools, and this conference seeks to provide answers through the conference content and by bringing together practitioners, software developers and the research community,? Knight said.

Currently, organizers are seeking papers on topics addressing the integration and interoperability of analytic modeling tools (BEM and SIM) with physical modeling tools (BIM). In addition, papers are sought describing workarounds, case studies, how to's, challenges, barriers and cloud based solutions.

Topics include:
?	Energy efficiency
?	HVAC component modeling
?	Urban scale modeling
?	HVAC load analysis
?	Lighting and daylighting
?	Computational fluid dynamics
?	Data exchange and interoperability
?	Energy auditing
?	Life cycle cost and economic analysis
?	Model calibration and validation
?	Combined use of multiple tools
?	Co-simulation
?	Optimization
?	Model and algorithm advances
?	Moisture
?	Weather data

Abstracts (400 or less words in length) are due Nov.  4, 2013. If accepted, papers are due March 3, 2014. The conference papers will be a maximum of 8 pages in length.

To submit an abstract or for more information, visit www.ashrae.org/simulation2014.

A call for presenters will be announced after the call for papers closes.  Invited speakers and keynote speakers will be announced.

The conference will cover two-and-a half days and will be preceded by two days of training seminars and short courses.

?The goal of the conference is help make better decisions through the application of simulation and modeling over the entire building life cycle from the earliest concept through operation and maintenance,? Knight said.

ASHRAE, founded in 1894, is a building technology society with more than 50,000 members worldwide. The Society and its members focus on building systems, energy efficiency, indoor air quality, refrigeration and sustainability. Through research, standards writing, publishing, certification and continuing education, ASHRAE shapes tomorrow?s built environment today. More information can be found at www.ashrae.org/news.

IBPSA-USA is the United States regional affiliate of the International Building Performance Simulation Association (IBPSA). The mission of IBPSA-USA is to advance and promote the science of building simulation in order to improve the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of new and existing buildings in the United States.

Hi Guys;

If some one really wants to run  ASEAM,  I have a machine mothballed 
that runs

Windows 98SE and can boot in the DOS 3.31 mode.  It is an 800 Mhz Pentium

SECC Cartridge CPU and I believe it has  512 MB memory installed with 
768 MB max.

  It has RAID 0 twin 40 GBs,  3.5: floppy, CD burner,  5 cartridge tape 
drives

as well as IO Mega Zip Drive  250 MB.  I will have to check to see if the

AGP video card still works.  This machine can access many cartridge tape 
formats.

Motherboard is Intel  SE440BX2NAV .   Let me know..

Hi John!

Funny thing is - running a properly configured version of ASEAM locally and quickly TODAY on an untethered Galaxy, IOS or Windows tablet might be kind of cool. Game-changing even.

Does anyone know if any way to (easily) re-compile it?

My $0.02 of contribution.  I have many fond (and not so fond) memories of ASEAM.

Hi Guys;

If some one really wants to run  ASEAM,  I have a machine mothballed that runs

Windows 98SE and can boot in the DOS 3.31 mode.  It is an 800 Mhz Pentium

SECC Cartridge CPU and I believe it has  512 MB memory installed with
768 MB max.

  It has RAID 0 twin 40 GBs,  3.5: floppy, CD burner,  5 cartridge tape drives

as well as IO Mega Zip Drive  250 MB.  I will have to check to see if the

AGP video card still works.  This machine can access many cartridge tape formats.

Motherboard is Intel  SE440BX2NAV .   Let me know..

Hi Adam,

This posting is reaching an audience which includes many mechanical designers of varying experience, and there are no rules restricting the subject matter over the mailing lists, but I think you may crossing a line of comfort for many professionals by presenting a series of questions which are essentially seeking to arrive at medical/healthcare advice.

Any responsible response on this forum would absolutely include the direction to consult your physician first.  For professional liability reasons, it may also be correct to say there is no other responsible way to respond to this query.  Anything along the lines of "what I would do..." invites the possibility for someone (maybe not you) to "lawyer up" down the road.

That said, I am comfortable sharing a few general and succinct points which cannot be construed as medical advice:

*         Consider particulate filtration (dust/pollen/mold/smoke) and gas phase filtration (ozone, off-gassing of materials) as two separate problems.  There are 'hybrid' products intended to address both categories, but a really fancy particulate filter should not be expected to pick up gaseous contaminants and vice versa.

*         Gas phase filtration media (i.e. activated carbon) DOES require a replacement schedule to maintain a continued effect, and the only way to determine that frequency for a specific environment is with testing.

*         If outdoor gas (ozone)  and particulate (smoke) contaminants are bad enough, a leaky envelope (and windows/doors left open) can overwhelm even extensive efforts to improve indoor air quality.  Practical and affordable measures to minimize infiltration should be considered as part of your filtration strategy.

*         Here is a solid link for further reading on the topic of IAQ, with many published research and resources specific to the topics you're bringing to the table: http://www.epa.gov/iaq/pubs/residair.html

I hope this helps answer some of the non-medical facets of your query!  Definitely consult a healthcare professional for recommendations to arrive at a strategy that fits your needs.

Regards,

~Nick

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Filter options for residential retrofit (chemically sensitive occupant)

Apologies if off-topic, but perhaps someone with HVAC experience in this arena can provide some insights off-line.

-------------

I recently vacated my house due to mold contamination. Problems were extensive in subfloor and crawlspace. Kitchen and several bathrooms had to be gutted. Remediation is now complete, and remodeling nearing completion. House has an  American Standard AUD100R9V5K4  Ser #8235NSX1G forced air furnace, and no cooling system (located in Colorado). The system is 100% recirc, with no humidifier. We have kept the furnace, but replaced all ducts to eliminate concern of mold spore contamination. All interior surfaces of building have been 'treated', and all personal belongings removed. Unfortunately, we have learned that sometimes even dead mold spores can linger (clinging to surfaces, etc), and if inhaled by a sensitive occupant (that's me), can then induce recurrence of health problems.

Question: What would be the best way to introduce high quality filtration to this system? (At this point, targets include spores, pollen, and even chemicals off-gassing from new materials).
Obvious options would seem to include:

- high Merv-rating filters in existing furnace
- 'sidecar' HEPA / Activated charcoal unit on the CAR (a good option, but doesn't treat 100% of the air)
- UV has fallen out of favor since we don't have a cooling coil to point it at, and not sure what other surface would be appropriate
- Electric / ionizing systems have fallen out of favor due to ozone conerns
- Could fabricate a deck in the CAR just upstream of furnace to receive a HEPA filter, and suffer the fan energy penalty in exchange for additional filtration confidence.
- Not sure what to make of stand-alone Activated Charcoal filters -- seems like they need to be discharged frequently. True?
- Another option would be to go with just the MERV filter in the furnace, then purchase mobile stand-alone HEPA / Charcoal units for main rooms of each floor. More local control, but more noise.
- Are there other options we're missing?

Note:
- We are well aware of benefits of OA in such situations, but there are complications with high smoke and ozone days in this region, so 100% will actually be desirable at times -- and night flushing is a common strategy when conditions allow. Also, the house is 115yrs old, so infiltration is significant anyway.
- HRV would obviously come into play if we pursue an OA configuration, but when filtration requirements are added, we're concerned about complexity of system.

Has anyone gone through this type of exercise? Comments / suggestions welcome.

Regards,

Adam

You can try this forum, I'm sure some of the members are familiar. It isn't a primary reason most people will have joined the mailing list. A few questions on the topic might be okay, especially pertaining to how an energy model might be used in the M&V process.

If it became very common to have M&V questions by yourself or others I think it should be moved to another venue.

A couple of other potential resources for you:


1.       If your questions are specific to LEED certification, you should try LEED User.


2.       I don't know if a forum exists on StackExchange.com, but there could be an M&V forum there, I haven't looked.


3.       ASHRAE also has a new message board www.ASHRAExCHANGE.org<http://www.ASHRAExCHANGE.org> which is definitely an appropriate forum, but may not see heavy traffic.

I hope this helps!

In this month?s IBPSA-NYC meet, we?re switching gears and instead of
exploring simulation tools, we?re taking a look at new and innovative ways
to visualize building performance data. Visualizing performance data to
tell a good story is often under discussed and we hope to pull back the
covers on it a bit. Hope you can join us in this conversation!

Descriptions

Presentation 1

Title: Dhour - Grasshopper Based Visualization Toolkit

Kyle Steinfeld, Assistant Professor, Department of Architecture, University
of California, Berkeley

This presentation will detail a new prototyping visualization toolkit
called "Dhour", developed for the Grasshopper visual programming
environment, which enables the situational development of information
graphics. By enabling more nuanced and customizable views of complex data,
the software described here offers designers an exploratory framework in
contrast to the highly directed tools currently available.

About the Speaker: Kyle Steinfeld is an Assistant Professor specializing in
digital design technologies in the Department of Architecture at University
of California Berkeley, where he teaches undergraduate and graduate design
studios, core courses in architectural representation, and advanced
seminars in digital modeling and visualization.  Professionally, he has
worked with and consulted for a number of design firms, including Skidmore
Owings and Merrill, Acconci Studio, Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates,
Howler/Yoon, Diller Scofidio Renfro, and TEN Arquitectos.  His research
interests include collaborative design technology platforms and bioclimatic
design visualization, and he holds a Masters of Architecture from MIT and a
Bachelor's Degree in Design from the University of Florida.


Presentation 2

Title: Visualizing Building Performance Data

Neil Katz, Associate, Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, Chicago

Visualizing analysis results can be as important as generating the analysis
itself. This information should be presented in a way that non-engineers -
a client, a designer - can understand, and (even more importantly) can be
used as part of the design process to improve and optimize a design; ie.
can be used as a decision-making tool. This is particularly true during the
early design phases of a project.

This presentation highlights examples of visualizing energy and lighting
analysis results, through color-coded graphs, mapping results onto
visually-identifiable building models, and even animating the results
through time. One project will be presented as a case study, and additional
visualization examples will be shown as well.

About the Speaker: Neil Katz is an architect with Skidmore, Owings &
Merrill. His area of expertise is ?computational design?, which includes
parametric and algorithmic design and modeling, building information
modeling, and various kinds of analysis. While computational tools
(computers and applications) are intensely used and developed,
?computational design? is more an approach to design than these tools.

Geometry and visualization are important aspects of his work, which is
primarily immersed in projects as part of the project team, but also
includes research which spans many projects (and some research is
independent of projects).

Neil has taught parametric modeling and various software applications at
the office and at schools of architecture in New York and Chicago
(including: NYU, the New York School of Interior Design, Parsons / the New
School, IIT, and the School of the Art Institute).

Vikram,

Speaking as a mechanical contractor and former HVAC equipment manufacturer's representative, I can say that without a lot of experience, it can be incredibly risky to use rules of thumb for pricing AHU's.  Cost could easily range from $2/CFM to $10+/CFM based on the capacity, construction details, features, brand, etc.

When in doubt and when you need a quick budget, just reach out to your local product reps.  As Vinay posted, AAON is a quality manufacturer.  Carrier, Trane, McQuay, and others also build good products.  Most engineered product reps will carry multiple brands to cover a wide range of features and price points.  These people will (usually) be more than happy to run a selection and provide a budget price for you.  If you're not familiar with your local reps, check the manufacturer websites or call--they will usually point you to the local sales office.  Or your local ASHRAE chapter might provide a useful directory.

When speaking with the reps, it's best to give them as much detail as possible about what you're looking for.  Early in the design process you might not have every detail, but the sooner you can tell them supply CFM and external static pressure, return CFM and external static pressure (if applicable), cooling source and capacity, heating source and capacity, whether or not there will be energy recovery, type of filtration required, whether it needs to be installed inside or outside, and anything else you can share the better.  Obviously, the more detail you can provide, the better, so they can narrow down the best product that fits and price it with the features needed.

Of course, keep in mind that installation of that equipment is another animal....  For that, you might want to strike up a friendship with a local mechanical contractor.

Good luck!

Descriptions

Presentation 1

Title: Dhour - Grasshopper Based Visualization Toolkit

Kyle Steinfeld, Assistant Professor, Department of Architecture, University of California, Berkeley


This presentation will detail a new prototyping visualization toolkit called "Dhour", developed for the Grasshopper visual programming environment, which enables the situational development of information graphics. By enabling more nuanced and customizable views of complex data, the software described here offers designers an exploratory framework in contrast to the highly directed tools currently available.

About the Speaker: Kyle Steinfeld is an Assistant Professor specializing in digital design technologies in the Department of Architecture at University of California Berkeley, where he teaches undergraduate and graduate design studios, core courses in architectural representation, and advanced seminars in digital modeling and visualization.  Professionally, he has worked with and consulted for a number of design firms, including Skidmore Owings and Merrill, Acconci Studio, Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates, Howler/Yoon, Diller Scofidio Renfro, and TEN Arquitectos.  His research interests include collaborative design technology platforms and bioclimatic design visualization, and he holds a Masters of Architecture from MIT and a Bachelor's Degree in Design from the University of Florida.


Presentation 2

Title: Visualizing Building Performance Data

Neil Katz, Associate, Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, Chicago


Visualizing analysis results can be as important as generating the analysis itself. This information should be presented in a way that non-engineers - a client, a designer - can understand, and (even more importantly) can be used as part of the design process to improve and optimize a design; ie. can be used as a decision-making tool. This is particularly true during the early design phases of a project.


This presentation highlights examples of visualizing energy and lighting analysis results, through color-coded graphs, mapping results onto visually-identifiable building models, and even animating the results through time. One project will be presented as a case study, and additional visualization examples will be shown as well.


About the Speaker: Neil Katz is an architect with Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. His area of expertise is "computational design", which includes parametric and algorithmic design and modeling, building information modeling, and various kinds of analysis. While computational tools (computers and applications) are intensely used and developed, "computational design" is more an approach to design than these tools.


Geometry and visualization are important aspects of his work, which is primarily immersed in projects as part of the project team, but also includes research which spans many projects (and some research is independent of projects).

Neil has taught parametric modeling and various software applications at the office and at schools of architecture in New York and Chicago (including: NYU, the New York School of Interior Design, Parsons / the New School, IIT, and the School of the Art Institute).

Hi,

Good luck finding that in epw format.

If you come empty handed, at worse you could maybe use Mombasa in Kenya, which is not "that" far away and also on the coast (roughly 300km south). Maybe check some weather data and see if they seem to have similar climate or not...

Ok, so I received this comment.  The one with the provide ASHRAE minimums in the Baseline for spaces with DCV.  I understand this is a generic comment - Ok.
However, LEED IEQ Credit 2 is not being pursued and the ASHRAE minimum ventilation requirements are what is being Proposed for in each space that has DCV.

Does this not mean that the Baseline ventilation rate and the Proposed ventilation rate will still be equal?
Not sure how to respond other than to simply say what is stated here.

Thanks,
Kevin

I think this requirement comes from the mandatory provisions of 90.1.

6.4.3.4.3 Shutoff Damper Controls. Both outdoor
air supply and exhaust systems shall be equipped with motorized
dampers that will automatically shut when the systems or
spaces served are not in use. Ventilation outdoor air dampers
shall be capable of automatically shutting off during preoccupancy
building warm-up, cool down, and setback, except
when ventilation reduces energy costs (e.g., night purge) or
when ventilation must be supplied to meet code requirements.

Thoughts??

Dear Patrick,

Thank you for sharing this GBCI response!  It is very informative and, while I won't admit that I've been modeling anything incorrectly, I am going to change a couple of things :).
In particular, I have heard on several occasions that the Increased Ventilation credit was a clear case of "IEQ vs. energy"; you make a decision to trade one against the other.  After reading the GBCI response below and then double-checking with ASHRAE 90.1, I find that they are consistent with each other and effectively allow no penalty for the increased energy caused by increased ventilation.  Very curious, considering there is no science which demonstrates a health benefit for outdoor airflows greater than that required by ASHRAE 62.1!
The other item is that I failed to notice (and still can't find) anything in 621.1 which says that unoccupied ventilation should be zero.  I guess that is OK, but is also curious, since a portion of the ventilation calcs in 62.1 include consideration for off-gassing materials (which are always present.)
All in all, I'm smarter than I was as a result of your post, so it's a good day!  Thanks again.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] usgbc response to outdoor air question

back in september there was a thread about what the outdoor air rate in a baseline simulation should be compared to a proposed simulation, specifically when one is adding 30% more outdoor air to meet the ieqc2 requirement and earn 1 leed point.  there were differences of opinions about the flow rates between baseline and proposed being either the same (as required in 90.1 app g) or the baseline being the calculated per 62.1 and the proposed being as designed.

so i submitted a support request to the usgbc and the reply i received is below, but in short the response is that unless you're using dcv optionally the outdoor air rates in the baseline and proposed energy simulations for eac1 should be the same.  the response below gives the standard responses to differing outdoor air rate scenarios.

patrick

Dear Patrick,

Thank you for contacting the Green Building Certification Institute.

You ask very good questions related to the relationship between ASHRAE Standards 62.1 and 90.1, and how these standards are applied across multiple LEED Rating System prerequisites and credits.

The simple answer to your question is that, for systems without demand controlled ventilation, the outdoor air included in EA Credit 1 energy simulations must be the same in the Baseline and Proposed cases. If the project is attempting IEQ Credit 2 Increased Ventilation, then the values calculated in IEQc2 must be used in the EAc1 Basline and Proposed case energy models. Note that IEQc2 does not limit the project to providing only 30% more outdoor air than AHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate Procedure minimums, so higher amounts are acceptable, as long as they are modeled identically in both the Baseline and Proposed case energy models.

The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems that do not have demand controlled ventilation:

It is unclear whether the minimum outside air rates (in CFM) were modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case for all zones not having Demand Control Ventilation in the Proposed case. Please confirm that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed cases using the proposed case rates. Additionally, please verify that all systems in both the baseline and proposed case are modeled with zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case).

The situation becomes a bit more complicated in you have systems that have demand controlled ventilation (often implemented as Carbon Dioxide control of outdoor air or as programmed control of outdoor air based on occupancy sensors.) In this case the Baseline case energy model must include the minimum outdoor air as determined by the ASHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate Procedure calculations for all systems having demand controlled ventilation.

The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems that do have demand controlled ventilation:

Demand control ventilation was modeled for credit in the proposed case. Appendix G allows schedule changes for demand control ventilation as approved by the rating authority (Table G3.1#4(Baseline)). As the LEED Certification rating authority, GBCI requires that the outside air ventilation rates for the Baseline case be modeled using minimum ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or 2007 for LEED-NC 2009 projects) rates wherever credit is taken for demand control ventilation in the Proposed case. The proposed case minimum rates at design conditions should be modeled as designed. Please verify that the Baseline Case model reflects ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or 2007) minimum rates for any spaces where credit is taken for demand control ventilation, or revise the model accordingly.

CUSTOMER INQUIRY:
I am trying to verify what the minimum outdoor airflow rate required for EAc1 is and am not sure if this requires a CIR.

If the Proposed outdoor air ventilation is a minimum of 30% higher than the minimum required by ASHRAE 62 in order to achieve 1 LEED point for credit IEQC2 is the Baseline outdoor air rate also 30% higher than the minimum required by ASHRAE 62? or would the Baseline outdoor air ventilation rate be the minimum outdoor air rate per ASHRAE 62 calculations.

In other words, if ASHRAE 62 requires a minimum of 1,000 CFM of outdoor air, and 1,300 CFM is provided to attain 1 LEED point via IEQC1, is the Baseline outdoor air flow rate 1,000 CFM or 1,300 CFM in the energy simulation?

90.1-2007/2004 both say the minimu    m outdoor airflow rates shall be the same for both the proposed and baseline building designs, as does the user manual.

But this logic seems to reward the Proposed simulation by conditioning the additional outdoor air supplied (300 cfm in the example above) to achieve IEQC1 in the Baseline system as well as the proposed.

The logic of using the minimum required in the Baseline case is reflected in EAC1 in the equipment efficiency requirements. Baseline efficiencies are the minimum required, e.g. SEER 13 for packaged units.

It is the intent of the requirement that I am not sure is clear. Increasing the outdoor air ventilation rate increases the energy used to condition the outdoor air, so if the intent is to put the onus on Proposed design to show energy reduction/LEED compliance over the 90.1/62 requirements shouldn't the Baseline outdoor air be the minimum air flow rate per the ASHRAE 62 calculations? This puts the onus on the design team to provide a design that compensates for the increase in energy to meet IEQC2 by providing some method of processing the increase in outdoor air while still reducing energy consumption.

My understanding is that for a 90.1-2007 outside air is modeled at the same CFM even if it's beyond ASHRAE 62.1 requirements with no energy penalty. However, this is no longer true in 90.1-2010 where the baseline is to follow ASRAE 62.1.

Also, I thought there was a ruling or interpretation to 62.1 that only allowed the elimination of the occupant portion of the ventilation to be shut off during unoccupied hours, but the area based outside air needs to be maintained at night to handle off-gassing.  I believe the 90.1 folks are still discussing how to incorporate this ruling into the standard.

If you don't have more DCV than the baseline, just use show in a calculation the total CFM and fraction of outside air for each AHU and show them the total is approximately the same. There is some latitude here for rounding errors and the like as some complex buildings may be off by a few percent. If your proposed outside cfm is slightly greater than your baseline outside cfm, then you should definitely be ok as your model will be conservative.

Hope that helps,

Fred

Ok, so I received this comment.  The one with the provide ASHRAE minimums in the Baseline for spaces with DCV.  I understand this is a generic comment - Ok.
However, LEED IEQ Credit 2 is not being pursued and the ASHRAE minimum ventilation requirements are what is being Proposed for in each space that has DCV.

Does this not mean that the Baseline ventilation rate and the Proposed ventilation rate will still be equal?
Not sure how to respond other than to simply say what is stated here.

I think this requirement comes from the mandatory provisions of 90.1.

6.4.3.4.3 Shutoff Damper Controls. Both outdoor
air supply and exhaust systems shall be equipped with motorized
dampers that will automatically shut when the systems or
spaces served are not in use. Ventilation outdoor air dampers
shall be capable of automatically shutting off during preoccupancy
building warm-up, cool down, and setback, except
when ventilation reduces energy costs (e.g., night purge) or
when ventilation must be supplied to meet code requirements.

Thoughts??

Dear Patrick,

Thank you for sharing this GBCI response!  It is very informative and, while I won't admit that I've been modeling anything incorrectly, I am going to change a couple of things :).
In particular, I have heard on several occasions that the Increased Ventilation credit was a clear case of "IEQ vs. energy"; you make a decision to trade one against the other.  After reading the GBCI response below and then double-checking with ASHRAE 90.1, I find that they are consistent with each other and effectively allow no penalty for the increased energy caused by increased ventilation.  Very curious, considering there is no science which demonstrates a health benefit for outdoor airflows greater than that required by ASHRAE 62.1!
The other item is that I failed to notice (and still can't find) anything in 621.1 which says that unoccupied ventilation should be zero.  I guess that is OK, but is also curious, since a portion of the ventilation calcs in 62.1 include consideration for off-gassing materials (which are always present.)
All in all, I'm smarter than I was as a result of your post, so it's a good day!  Thanks again.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] usgbc response to outdoor air question

back in september there was a thread about what the outdoor air rate in a baseline simulation should be compared to a proposed simulation, specifically when one is adding 30% more outdoor air to meet the ieqc2 requirement and earn 1 leed point.  there were differences of opinions about the flow rates between baseline and proposed being either the same (as required in 90.1 app g) or the baseline being the calculated per 62.1 and the proposed being as designed.

so i submitted a support request to the usgbc and the reply i received is below, but in short the response is that unless you're using dcv optionally the outdoor air rates in the baseline and proposed energy simulations for eac1 should be the same.  the response below gives the standard responses to differing outdoor air rate scenarios.

Dear Patrick,

Thank you for contacting the Green Building Certification Institute.

You ask very good questions related to the relationship between ASHRAE Standards 62.1 and 90.1, and how these standards are applied across multiple LEED Rating System prerequisites and credits.

The simple answer to your question is that, for systems without demand controlled ventilation, the outdoor air included in EA Credit 1 energy simulations must be the same in the Baseline and Proposed cases. If the project is attempting IEQ Credit 2 Increased Ventilation, then the values calculated in IEQc2 must be used in the EAc1 Basline and Proposed case energy models. Note that IEQc2 does not limit the project to providing only 30% more outdoor air than AHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate Procedure minimums, so higher amounts are acceptable, as long as they are modeled identically in both the Baseline and Proposed case energy models.

The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems that do not have demand controlled ventilation:

It is unclear whether the minimum outside air rates (in CFM) were modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case for all zones not having Demand Control Ventilation in the Proposed case. Please confirm that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed cases using the proposed case rates. Additionally, please verify that all systems in both the baseline and proposed case are modeled with zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case).

The situation becomes a bit more complicated in you have systems that have demand controlled ventilation (often implemented as Carbon Dioxide control of outdoor air or as programmed control of outdoor air based on occupancy sensors.) In this case the Baseline case energy model must include the minimum outdoor air as determined by the ASHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate Procedure calculations for all systems having demand controlled ventilation.

The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems that do have demand controlled ventilation:

Demand control ventilation was modeled for credit in the proposed case. Appendix G allows schedule changes for demand control ventilation as approved by the rating authority (Table G3.1#4(Baseline)). As the LEED Certification rating authority, GBCI requires that the outside air ventilation rates for the Baseline case be modeled using minimum ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or 2007 for LEED-NC 2009 projects) rates wherever credit is taken for demand control ventilation in the Proposed case. The proposed case minimum rates at design conditions should be modeled as designed. Please verify that the Baseline Case model reflects ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or 2007) minimum rates for any spaces where credit is taken for demand control ventilation, or revise the model accordingly. For all other spaces, please confirm that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed cases. Additionally, please verify that all systems in both the baseline and proposed cases are modeled with zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case).

Finally, even though you don't address energy recovery in your question, whether or not you have energy recovery in your ventilation systems may affect how much better (or worse) your Proposed case energy models perform in relation to your Baseline case energy models.

The following generic LEED Review Comment addresses energy recovery in EAc1 energy models as it relates to ventilation systems.

Energy recovery is modeled for credit in the Proposed case. Please provide further information regarding the energy recovery efficiency, verify that outside air is modeled with zero flow in both the Baseline and Proposed cases during unoccupied periods when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed Case), and indicate the bypass mechanism used to bypass the energy recovery during mild conditions.

ASHRAE 62.1-2010 may be viewed online for free from the ASHRAE website at:
https://www.ashrae.org/standards-research--technology/standards--guidelines.
 Its a little slow and painful to view and navigate since it is a free.

Also, all approved addenda may be downloaded in PDF from here:
https://www.ashrae.org/standards-research--technology/standards-addenda.

I reviewed both documents and did not see any rulings, interpretations or
addenda that would indicate that the area based portion of the ventilation
rate is required to operate 24/7 or during unoccupied periods.  If anyone
has a better resource than this please post.
Thanks,
Dennis

Hello  All,



Please see the following relevant quote from 62.1 2010:





To me this implies that all of the requirements in section 6 (which include
both the area and occupant components) are only applicable ?when [spaces]
are expected to be occupied?.



Regards,

Mike

ASHRAE 62.1-2010 may be viewed online for free from the ASHRAE website at:
https://www.ashrae.org/standards-research--technology/standards--guidelines.
 Its a little slow and painful to view and navigate since it is a free.



Also, all approved addenda may be downloaded in PDF from here:
https://www.ashrae.org/standards-research--technology/standards-addenda.



I reviewed both documents and did not see any rulings, interpretations or
addenda that would indicate that the area based portion of the ventilation
rate is required to operate 24/7 or during unoccupied periods.  If anyone
has a better resource than this please post.

Thanks,

Dennis

My understanding is that for a 90.1-2007 outside air is modeled at the same

However, this is no longer true in 90.1-2010 where the baseline is to
follow ASRAE 62.1.



Also, I thought there was a ruling or interpretation to 62.1 that only
allowed the elimination of the occupant portion of the ventilation to be
shut off during unoccupied hours, but the area based outside air needs to
be maintained at night to handle off-gassing.  I believe the 90.1 folks are
still discussing how to incorporate this ruling into the standard.



If you don?t have more DCV than the baseline, just use show in a
calculation the total CFM and fraction of outside air for each AHU and show
them the total is approximately the same. There is some latitude here for
rounding errors and the like as some complex buildings may be off by a few
percent. If your proposed outside cfm is slightly greater than your
baseline outside cfm, then you should definitely be ok as your model will
be conservative.



Hope that helps,

Ok, so I received this comment.  The one with the provide ASHRAE minimums
in the Baseline for spaces with DCV.  I understand this is a generic
comment - Ok.

However, LEED IEQ Credit 2 is not being pursued and the ASHRAE minimum
ventilation requirements are what is being Proposed for in each space that
has DCV.



Does this not mean that the Baseline ventilation rate and the Proposed
ventilation rate will still be equal?

Not sure how to respond other than to simply say what is stated here.

Dear Patrick,



Thank you for sharing this GBCI response!  It is very informative and,
while I won?t admit that I?ve been modeling anything incorrectly, I
*am*going to change a couple of things
J.

In particular, I have heard on several occasions that the Increased
Ventilation credit was a clear case of ?IEQ vs. energy?; you make a
decision to trade one against the other.  After reading the GBCI response
below and then double-checking with ASHRAE 90.1, I find that they are
consistent with each other and effectively allow no penalty for the
increased energy caused by increased ventilation.  Very curious,
considering there is no science which demonstrates a health benefit for
outdoor airflows greater than that required by ASHRAE 62.1!

The other item is that I failed to notice (and still can?t find) anything
in 621.1 which says that unoccupied ventilation should be zero.  I guess
that is OK, but is also curious, since a portion of the ventilation calcs
in 62.1 include consideration for off-gassing materials (which are always
present.)

All in all, I?m smarter than I was as a result of your post, so it?s a good
day!  Thanks again.

back in september there was a thread about what the outdoor air rate in a

specifically when one is adding 30% more outdoor air to meet the ieqc2
requirement and earn 1 leed point.  there were differences of opinions
about the flow rates between baseline and proposed being either the same
(as required in 90.1 app g) or the baseline being the calculated per 62.1
and the proposed being as designed.

so i submitted a support request to the usgbc and the reply i received is
below, but in short the response is that unless you're using dcv optionally
the outdoor air rates in the baseline and proposed energy simulations for
eac1 should be the same.  the response below gives the standard responses
to differing outdoor air rate scenarios.

Dear Patrick,

Thank you for contacting the Green Building Certification Institute.

You ask very good questions related to the relationship between ASHRAE
Standards 62.1 and 90.1, and how these standards are applied across
multiple LEED Rating System prerequisites and credits.

The simple answer to your question is that, for systems without demand
controlled ventilation, the outdoor air included in EA Credit 1 energy
simulations must be the same in the Baseline and Proposed cases. If the
project is attempting IEQ Credit 2 Increased Ventilation, then the values
calculated in IEQc2 must be used in the EAc1 Basline and Proposed case
energy models. Note that IEQc2 does not limit the project to providing only
30% more outdoor air than AHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate Procedure minimums,
so higher amounts are acceptable, as long as they are modeled identically
in both the Baseline and Proposed case energy models.

The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems
that do not have demand controlled ventilation:

It is unclear whether the minimum outside air rates (in CFM) were modeled
identically in the Baseline and Proposed case for all zones not having
Demand Control Ventilation in the Proposed case. Please confirm that
minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled identically in the
Baseline and Proposed cases using the proposed case rates. Additionally,
please verify that all systems in both the baseline and proposed case are
modeled with zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet
unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate
an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the
unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline
and Proposed case).

The situation becomes a bit more complicated in you have systems that have
demand controlled ventilation (often implemented as Carbon Dioxide control
of outdoor air or as programmed control of outdoor air based on occupancy
sensors.) In this case the Baseline case energy model must include the
minimum outdoor air as determined by the ASHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate
Procedure calculations for all systems having demand controlled
ventilation.

The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems
that do have demand controlled ventilation:

Demand control ventilation was modeled for credit in the proposed case.
Appendix G allows schedule changes for demand control ventilation as
approved by the rating authority (Table G3.1#4(Baseline)). As the LEED
Certification rating authority, GBCI requires that the outside air
ventilation rates for the Baseline case be modeled using minimum ASHRAE
62.1-2004 (or 2007 for LEED-NC 2009 projects) rates wherever credit is
taken for demand control ventilation in the Proposed case. The proposed
case minimum rates at design conditions should be modeled as designed.
Please verify that the Baseline Case model reflects ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or
2007) minimum rates for any spaces where credit is taken for demand control
ventilation, or revise the model accordingly. For all other spaces, please
confirm that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled
identically in the Baseline and Proposed cases. Additionally, please verify
that all systems in both the baseline and proposed cases are modeled with
zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback
temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate
minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied
outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and
Proposed case).

Finally, even though you don't address energy recovery in your question,
whether or not you have energy recovery in your ventilation systems may
affect how much better (or worse) your Proposed case energy models perform

energy models as it relates to ventilation systems.

Energy recovery is modeled for credit in the Proposed case. Please provide
further information regarding the energy recovery efficiency, verify that
outside air is modeled with zero flow in both the Baseline and Proposed
cases during unoccupied periods when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied
setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an
alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the
unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline

CUSTOMER INQUIRY:
I am trying to verify what the minimum outdoor airflow rate required for
EAc1 is and am not sure if this requires a CIR.

If the Proposed outdoor air ventilation is a minimum of 30% higher than the
minimum required by ASHRAE 62 in order to achieve 1 LEED point for credit
IEQC2 is the Baseline outdoor air rate also 30% higher than the minimum
required by ASHRAE 62? or would the Baseline outdoor air ventilation rate
be the minimum outdoor air rate per ASHRAE 62 calculations.

In other words, if ASHRAE 62 requires a minimum of 1,000 CFM of outdoor
air, and 1,300 CFM is provided to attain 1 LEED point via IEQC1, is the
Baseline outdoor air flow rate 1,000 CFM or 1,300 CFM in the energy
simulation?

90.1-2007/2004 both say the minimu    m outdoor airflow rates shall be the
same for both the proposed and baseline building designs, as does the user
manual.

But this logic seems to reward the Proposed simulation by conditioning the
additional outdoor air supplied (300 cfm in the example above) to achieve
IEQC1 in the Baseline system as well as the proposed.

The logic of using the minimum required in the Baseline case is reflected
in EAC1 in the equipment efficiency requirements. Baseline efficiencies are
the minimum required, e.g. SEER 13 for packaged units.

It is the intent of the requirement that I am not sure is clear. Increasing
the outdoor air ventilation rate increases the energy used to condition the
outdoor air, so if the intent is to put the onus on Proposed design to show
energy reduction/LEED compliance over the 90.1/62 requirements shouldn't
the Baseline outdoor air be the minimum air flow rate per the ASHRAE 62
calculations? This puts the onus on the design team to provide a design
that compensates for the increase in energy to meet IEQC2 by providing some
method of processing the increase in outdoor air while still reducing
energy consumption.

Dennis,
Attached is an interpretation from ASHRAE indicating the area based ventilation rate cannot be turned off during unoccupied hours (applicable to 2007 and 2010). Subsequently, ASHRAE is in the process of issuing an addendum that does allow the area based rate to be turned off based on occupancy controls. The addendum (also attached) went out for public review last spring. I don't see that it has been published on the ASHRAE website yet, so I'm not sure whether it has been fully approved by the committee yet.

Also, in my experience, LEED (v2009) requires that the baseline ventilation rate comply with the ASHRAE 62.1 minimum when DCV controls are implemented in the proposed design for spaces not required to have it per 90.1. This would be the only scenario where baseline ventilation rates differ from the proposed (i.e. no energy penalty for over ventilating). This changes for LEED v4 which used 90.1-2010.
Regards,
Bill

Hello  All,

Please see the following relevant quote from 62.1 2010:

To me this implies that all of the requirements in section 6 (which include both the area and occupant components) are only applicable "when [spaces] are expected to be occupied".

ASHRAE 62.1-2010 may be viewed online for free from the ASHRAE website at: https://www.ashrae.org/standards-research--technology/standards--guidelines.  Its a little slow and painful to view and navigate since it is a free.

Also, all approved addenda may be downloaded in PDF from here: https://www.ashrae.org/standards-research--technology/standards-addenda.

I reviewed both documents and did not see any rulings, interpretations or addenda that would indicate that the area based portion of the ventilation rate is required to operate 24/7 or during unoccupied periods.  If anyone has a better resource than this please post.
Thanks,
Dennis

My understanding is that for a 90.1-2007 outside air is modeled at the same CFM even if it's beyond ASHRAE 62.1 requirements with no energy penalty. However, this is no longer true in 90.1-2010 where the baseline is to follow ASRAE 62.1.

Also, I thought there was a ruling or interpretation to 62.1 that only allowed the elimination of the occupant portion of the ventilation to be shut off during unoccupied hours, but the area based outside air needs to be maintained at night to handle off-gassing.  I believe the 90.1 folks are still discussing how to incorporate this ruling into the standard.

If you don't have more DCV than the baseline, just use show in a calculation the total CFM and fraction of outside air for each AHU and show them the total is approximately the same. There is some latitude here for rounding errors and the like as some complex buildings may be off by a few percent. If your proposed outside cfm is slightly greater than your baseline outside cfm, then you should definitely be ok as your model will be conservative.

Hope that helps,

Ok, so I received this comment.  The one with the provide ASHRAE minimums in the Baseline for spaces with DCV.  I understand this is a generic comment - Ok.
However, LEED IEQ Credit 2 is not being pursued and the ASHRAE minimum ventilation requirements are what is being Proposed for in each space that has DCV.

Does this not mean that the Baseline ventilation rate and the Proposed ventilation rate will still be equal?
Not sure how to respond other than to simply say what is stated here.

I think this requirement comes from the mandatory provisions of 90.1.

6.4.3.4.3 Shutoff Damper Controls. Both outdoor
air supply and exhaust systems shall be equipped with motorized
dampers that will automatically shut when the systems or
spaces served are not in use. Ventilation outdoor air dampers
shall be capable of automatically shutting off during preoccupancy
building warm-up, cool down, and setback, except
when ventilation reduces energy costs (e.g., night purge) or
when ventilation must be supplied to meet code requirements.

Thoughts??

Dear Patrick,

Thank you for sharing this GBCI response!  It is very informative and, while I won't admit that I've been modeling anything incorrectly, I am going to change a couple of things :).
In particular, I have heard on several occasions that the Increased Ventilation credit was a clear case of "IEQ vs. energy"; you make a decision to trade one against the other.  After reading the GBCI response below and then double-checking with ASHRAE 90.1, I find that they are consistent with each other and effectively allow no penalty for the increased energy caused by increased ventilation.  Very curious, considering there is no science which demonstrates a health benefit for outdoor airflows greater than that required by ASHRAE 62.1!
The other item is that I failed to notice (and still can't find) anything in 621.1 which says that unoccupied ventilation should be zero.  I guess that is OK, but is also curious, since a portion of the ventilation calcs in 62.1 include consideration for off-gassing materials (which are always present.)
All in all, I'm smarter than I was as a result of your post, so it's a good day!  Thanks again.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] usgbc response to outdoor air question

back in september there was a thread about what the outdoor air rate in a baseline simulation should be compared to a proposed simulation, specifically when one is adding 30% more outdoor air to meet the ieqc2 requirement and earn 1 leed point.  there were differences of opinions about the flow rates between baseline and proposed being either the same (as required in 90.1 app g) or the baseline being the calculated per 62.1 and the proposed being as designed.

so i submitted a support request to the usgbc and the reply i received is below, but in short the response is that unless you're using dcv optionally the outdoor air rates in the baseline and proposed energy simulations for eac1 should be the same.  the response below gives the standard responses to differing outdoor air rate scenarios.

Dear Patrick,

Thank you for contacting the Green Building Certification Institute.

You ask very good questions related to the relationship between ASHRAE Standards 62.1 and 90.1, and how these standards are applied across multiple LEED Rating System prerequisites and credits.

The simple answer to your question is that, for systems without demand controlled ventilation, the outdoor air included in EA Credit 1 energy simulations must be the same in the Baseline and Proposed cases. If the project is attempting IEQ Credit 2 Increased Ventilation, then the values calculated in IEQc2 must be used in the EAc1 Basline and Proposed case energy models. Note that IEQc2 does not limit the project to providing only 30% more outdoor air than AHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate Procedure minimums, so higher amounts are acceptable, as long as they are modeled identically in both the Baseline and Proposed case energy models.

The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems that do not have demand controlled ventilation:

It is unclear whether the minimum outside air rates (in CFM) were modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case for all zones not having Demand Control Ventilation in the Proposed case. Please confirm that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed cases using the proposed case rates. Additionally, please verify that all systems in both the baseline and proposed case are modeled with zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case).

The situation becomes a bit more complicated in you have systems that have demand controlled ventilation (often implemented as Carbon Dioxide control of outdoor air or as programmed control of outdoor air based on occupancy sensors.) In this case the Baseline case energy model must include the minimum outdoor air as determined by the ASHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate Procedure calculations for all systems having demand controlled ventilation.

The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems that do have demand controlled ventilation:

Demand control ventilation was modeled for credit in the proposed case. Appendix G allows schedule changes for demand control ventilation as approved by the rating authority (Table G3.1#4(Baseline)). As the LEED Certification rating authority, GBCI requires that the outside air ventilation rates for the Baseline case be modeled using minimum ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or 2007 for LEED-NC 2009 projects) rates wherever credit is taken for demand control ventilation in the Proposed case. The proposed case minimum rates at design conditions should be modeled as designed. Please verify that the Baseline Case model reflects ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or 2007) minimum rates for any spaces where credit is taken for demand control ventilation, or revise the model accordingly. For all other spaces, please confirm that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed cases. Additionally, please verify that all systems in both the baseline and proposed cases are modeled with zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case).

Finally, even though you don't address energy recovery in your question, whether or not you have energy recovery in your ventilation systems may affect how much better (or worse) your Proposed case energy models perform in relation to your Baseline case energy models.

The following generic LEED Review Comment addresses energy recovery in EAc1 energy models as it relates to ventilation systems.

Energy recovery is modeled for credit in the Proposed case. Please provide further information regarding the energy recovery efficiency, verify that outside air is modeled with zero flow in both the Baseline and Proposed cases during unoccupied periods when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed Case), and indicate the bypass mechanism used to bypass the energy recovery during mild conditions.

2007 and 2010). Subsequently, ASHRAE is in the process of issuing an
addendum that does allow the area based rate to be turned off based on
occupancy controls. The addendum (also attached) went out for public review
last spring. I don't see that it has been published on the ASHRAE website
yet, so I'm not sure whether it has been fully approved by the committee
yet.

 

Also, in my experience, LEED (v2009) requires that the baseline ventilation
rate comply with the ASHRAE 62.1 minimum when DCV controls are implemented
in the proposed design for spaces not required to have it per 90.1. This
would be the only scenario where baseline ventilation rates differ from the
proposed (i.e. no energy penalty for over ventilating). This changes for
LEED v4 which used 90.1-2010.

Bill

Hello  All,

 

Please see the following relevant quote from 62.1 2010:

 

cid:image001.jpg at 01CEB608.8BB9B440

 

To me this implies that all of the requirements in section 6 (which include
both the area and occupant components) are only applicable "when [spaces]
are expected to be occupied".

ASHRAE 62.1-2010 may be viewed online for free from the ASHRAE website at:
https://www.ashrae.org/standards-research--technology/standards--guidelines.
Its a little slow and painful to view and navigate since it is a free.

 

Also, all approved addenda may be downloaded in PDF from here:
https://www.ashrae.org/standards-research--technology/standards-addenda.

 

I reviewed both documents and did not see any rulings, interpretations or
addenda that would indicate that the area based portion of the ventilation
rate is required to operate 24/7 or during unoccupied periods.  If anyone
has a better resource than this please post.

ASRAE 62.1. 

 

Also, I thought there was a ruling or interpretation to 62.1 that only
allowed the elimination of the occupant portion of the ventilation to be
shut off during unoccupied hours, but the area based outside air needs to be
maintained at night to handle off-gassing.  I believe the 90.1 folks are
still discussing how to incorporate this ruling into the standard. 

 

If you don't have more DCV than the baseline, just use show in a calculation
the total CFM and fraction of outside air for each AHU and show them the
total is approximately the same. There is some latitude here for rounding
errors and the like as some complex buildings may be off by a few percent.
If your proposed outside cfm is slightly greater than your baseline outside
cfm, then you should definitely be ok as your model will be conservative. 

 

Hope that helps,

 

Fred

Ok, so I received this comment.  The one with the provide ASHRAE minimums in
the Baseline for spaces with DCV.  I understand this is a generic comment -
Ok.  

However, LEED IEQ Credit 2 is not being pursued and the ASHRAE minimum
ventilation requirements are what is being Proposed for in each space that
has DCV.  

 

Does this not mean that the Baseline ventilation rate and the Proposed
ventilation rate will still be equal?

Not sure how to respond other than to simply say what is stated here.

I think this requirement comes from the mandatory provisions of 90.1.

 

6.4.3.4.3 Shutoff Damper Controls. Both outdoor

air supply and exhaust systems shall be equipped with motorized

dampers that will automatically shut when the systems or

spaces served are not in use. Ventilation outdoor air dampers

shall be capable of automatically shutting off during preoccupancy

building warm-up, cool down, and setback, except

when ventilation reduces energy costs (e.g., night purge) or

when ventilation must be supplied to meet code requirements.

 

Thoughts??

Dear Patrick,

 

Thank you for sharing this GBCI response!  It is very informative and, while
I won't admit that I've been modeling anything incorrectly, I am going to
change a couple of things J.

In particular, I have heard on several occasions that the Increased
Ventilation credit was a clear case of "IEQ vs. energy"; you make a decision
to trade one against the other.  After reading the GBCI response below and
then double-checking with ASHRAE 90.1, I find that they are consistent with
each other and effectively allow no penalty for the increased energy caused
by increased ventilation.  Very curious, considering there is no science
which demonstrates a health benefit for outdoor airflows greater than that
required by ASHRAE 62.1!

The other item is that I failed to notice (and still can't find) anything in
621.1 which says that unoccupied ventilation should be zero.  I guess that
is OK, but is also curious, since a portion of the ventilation calcs in 62.1
include consideration for off-gassing materials (which are always present.)

All in all, I'm smarter than I was as a result of your post, so it's a good
day!  Thanks again.

back in september there was a thread about what the outdoor air rate in a
baseline simulation should be compared to a proposed simulation,
specifically when one is adding 30% more outdoor air to meet the ieqc2
requirement and earn 1 leed point.  there were differences of opinions about
the flow rates between baseline and proposed being either the same (as
required in 90.1 app g) or the baseline being the calculated per 62.1 and
the proposed being as designed.

so i submitted a support request to the usgbc and the reply i received is
below, but in short the response is that unless you're using dcv optionally
the outdoor air rates in the baseline and proposed energy simulations for
eac1 should be the same.  the response below gives the standard responses to
differing outdoor air rate scenarios.

Dear Patrick,

Thank you for contacting the Green Building Certification Institute. 

You ask very good questions related to the relationship between ASHRAE
Standards 62.1 and 90.1, and how these standards are applied across multiple
LEED Rating System prerequisites and credits.

The simple answer to your question is that, for systems without demand
controlled ventilation, the outdoor air included in EA Credit 1 energy
simulations must be the same in the Baseline and Proposed cases. If the
project is attempting IEQ Credit 2 Increased Ventilation, then the values
calculated in IEQc2 must be used in the EAc1 Basline and Proposed case
energy models. Note that IEQc2 does not limit the project to providing only
30% more outdoor air than AHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate Procedure minimums, so
higher amounts are acceptable, as long as they are modeled identically in
both the Baseline and Proposed case energy models.

The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems
that do not have demand controlled ventilation:

It is unclear whether the minimum outside air rates (in CFM) were modeled
identically in the Baseline and Proposed case for all zones not having
Demand Control Ventilation in the Proposed case. Please confirm that minimum
outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled identically in the Baseline
and Proposed cases using the proposed case rates. Additionally, please
verify that all systems in both the baseline and proposed case are modeled
with zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied
setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an
alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the
unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline
and Proposed case).

The situation becomes a bit more complicated in you have systems that have
demand controlled ventilation (often implemented as Carbon Dioxide control
of outdoor air or as programmed control of outdoor air based on occupancy
sensors.) In this case the Baseline case energy model must include the
minimum outdoor air as determined by the ASHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate
Procedure calculations for all systems having demand controlled ventilation.


The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems
that do have demand controlled ventilation:

Demand control ventilation was modeled for credit in the proposed case.
Appendix G allows schedule changes for demand control ventilation as
approved by the rating authority (Table G3.1#4(Baseline)). As the LEED
Certification rating authority, GBCI requires that the outside air
ventilation rates for the Baseline case be modeled using minimum ASHRAE
62.1-2004 (or 2007 for LEED-NC 2009 projects) rates wherever credit is taken
for demand control ventilation in the Proposed case. The proposed case
minimum rates at design conditions should be modeled as designed. Please
verify that the Baseline Case model reflects ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or 2007)
minimum rates for any spaces where credit is taken for demand control
ventilation, or revise the model accordingly. For all other spaces, please
confirm that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled
identically in the Baseline and Proposed cases. Additionally, please verify
that all systems in both the baseline and proposed cases are modeled with
zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback
temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate
minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied
outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed
case).

Finally, even though you don't address energy recovery in your question,
whether or not you have energy recovery in your ventilation systems may
affect how much better (or worse) your Proposed case energy models perform
in relation to your Baseline case energy models. 

The following generic LEED Review Comment addresses energy recovery in EAc1
energy models as it relates to ventilation systems.

Energy recovery is modeled for credit in the Proposed case. Please provide
further information regarding the energy recovery efficiency, verify that
outside air is modeled with zero flow in both the Baseline and Proposed
cases during unoccupied periods when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied
setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an
alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the
unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline
and Proposed Case), and indicate the bypass mechanism used to bypass the
energy recovery during mild conditions. 

I hope that helps, but if you have any further questions or concerns, please

CUSTOMER INQUIRY:
I am trying to verify what the minimum outdoor airflow rate required for
EAc1 is and am not sure if this requires a CIR. 

If the Proposed outdoor air ventilation is a minimum of 30% higher than the
minimum required by ASHRAE 62 in order to achieve 1 LEED point for credit
IEQC2 is the Baseline outdoor air rate also 30% higher than the minimum
required by ASHRAE 62? or would the Baseline outdoor air ventilation rate be
the minimum outdoor air rate per ASHRAE 62 calculations. 

In other words, if ASHRAE 62 requires a minimum of 1,000 CFM of outdoor air,
and 1,300 CFM is provided to attain 1 LEED point via IEQC1, is the Baseline
outdoor air flow rate 1,000 CFM or 1,300 CFM in the energy simulation? 

90.1-2007/2004 both say the minimu    m outdoor airflow rates shall be the
same for both the proposed and baseline building designs, as does the user
manual. 

But this logic seems to reward the Proposed simulation by conditioning the
additional outdoor air supplied (300 cfm in the example above) to achieve
IEQC1 in the Baseline system as well as the proposed. 

The logic of using the minimum required in the Baseline case is reflected in
EAC1 in the equipment efficiency requirements. Baseline efficiencies are the
minimum required, e.g. SEER 13 for packaged units. 

It is the intent of the requirement that I am not sure is clear. Increasing
the outdoor air ventilation rate increases the energy used to condition the
outdoor air, so if the intent is to put the onus on Proposed design to show
energy reduction/LEED compliance over the 90.1/62 requirements shouldn't the
Baseline outdoor air be the minimum air flow rate per the ASHRAE 62
calculations? This puts the onus on the design team to provide a design that
compensates for the increase in energy to meet IEQC2 by providing some
method of processing the increase in outdoor air while still reducing energy
consumption.

Let me go ahead and confuse things further: IEQp1 requires that:

" Mechanical ventilation systems must be designed using the ventilation rate procedure as defined by ASHRAE 62.1-2007, or the applicable local code, whichever is more stringent."

So if your project is in a state that has adopted 62.1-2010 (such as OH) , then that is the standard you should be referencing. Which addenda you apply is at your discretion.

90.1 is very insistent that unless a building is intended to operate 24hrs a day, the system should not be running when the building is not occupied. I take that as what is intended by the phrase "expected to be occupied". The control on individual spaces on occupancy while the whole building is in occupied mode would be a separate matter where I can understand wanting to cover the area component.

I guess I've never heard anyone push the idea that building types such as schools or libraries should be ventilated 24hrs a day so that makes me a bit skeptical of a interpretation that would lead down that path.

Dennis,
Attached is an interpretation from ASHRAE indicating the area based ventilation rate cannot be turned off during unoccupied hours (applicable to 2007 and 2010). Subsequently, ASHRAE is in the process of issuing an addendum that does allow the area based rate to be turned off based on occupancy controls. The addendum (also attached) went out for public review last spring. I don't see that it has been published on the ASHRAE website yet, so I'm not sure whether it has been fully approved by the committee yet.

Also, in my experience, LEED (v2009) requires that the baseline ventilation rate comply with the ASHRAE 62.1 minimum when DCV controls are implemented in the proposed design for spaces not required to have it per 90.1. This would be the only scenario where baseline ventilation rates differ from the proposed (i.e. no energy penalty for over ventilating). This changes for LEED v4 which used 90.1-2010.

If you don't have more DCV than the baseline, just use show in a calculation the total CFM and fraction of outside air for each AHU and show them the total is approximately the same. There is some latitude here for rounding errors and the like as some complex buildings may be off by a few percent.

Ok, so I received this comment.  The one with the provide ASHRAE minimums in the Baseline for spaces with DCV.  I understand this is a generic comment - Ok.
However, LEED IEQ Credit 2 is not being pursued and the ASHRAE minimum ventilation requirements are what is being Proposed for in each space that has DCV.

Does this not mean that the Baseline ventilation rate and the Proposed ventilation rate will still be equal?
Not sure how to respond other than to simply say what is stated here.

I think this requirement comes from the mandatory provisions of 90.1.

6.4.3.4.3 Shutoff Damper Controls. Both outdoor
air supply and exhaust systems shall be equipped with motorized
dampers that will automatically shut when the systems or
spaces served are not in use. Ventilation outdoor air dampers
shall be capable of automatically shutting off during preoccupancy
building warm-up, cool down, and setback, except
when ventilation reduces energy costs (e.g., night purge) or
when ventilation must be supplied to meet code requirements.

Dear Patrick,

Thank you for sharing this GBCI response!  It is very informative and, while I won't admit that I've been modeling anything incorrectly, I am going to change a couple of things :).
In particular, I have heard on several occasions that the Increased Ventilation credit was a clear case of "IEQ vs. energy"; you make a decision to trade one against the other.  After reading the GBCI response below and then double-checking with ASHRAE 90.1, I find that they are consistent with each other and effectively allow no penalty for the increased energy caused by increased ventilation.  Very curious, considering there is no science which demonstrates a health benefit for outdoor airflows greater than that required by ASHRAE 62.1!
The other item is that I failed to notice (and still can't find) anything in 621.1 which says that unoccupied ventilation should be zero.  I guess that is OK, but is also curious, since a portion of the ventilation calcs in 62.1 include consideration for off-gassing materials (which are always present.)
All in all, I'm smarter than I was as a result of your post, so it's a good day!  Thanks again.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] usgbc response to outdoor air question

back in september there was a thread about what the outdoor air rate in a baseline simulation should be compared to a proposed simulation, specifically when one is adding 30% more outdoor air to meet the ieqc2 requirement and earn 1 leed point.  there were differences of opinions about the flow rates between baseline and proposed being either the same (as required in 90.1 app g) or the baseline being the calculated per 62.1 and the proposed being as designed.

so i submitted a support request to the usgbc and the reply i received is below, but in short the response is that unless you're using dcv optionally the outdoor air rates in the baseline and proposed energy simulations for eac1 should be the same.  the response below gives the standard responses to differing outdoor air rate scenarios.

Dear Patrick,

Thank you for contacting the Green Building Certification Institute.

You ask very good questions related to the relationship between ASHRAE Standards 62.1 and 90.1, and how these standards are applied across multiple LEED Rating System prerequisites and credits.

The simple answer to your question is that, for systems without demand controlled ventilation, the outdoor air included in EA Credit 1 energy simulations must be the same in the Baseline and Proposed cases. If the project is attempting IEQ Credit 2 Increased Ventilation, then the values calculated in IEQc2 must be used in the EAc1 Basline and Proposed case energy models. Note that IEQc2 does not limit the project to providing only 30% more outdoor air than AHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate Procedure minimums, so higher amounts are acceptable, as long as they are modeled identically in both the Baseline and Proposed case energy models.

The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems that do not have demand controlled ventilation:

It is unclear whether the minimum outside air rates (in CFM) were modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case for all zones not having Demand Control Ventilation in the Proposed case. Please confirm that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed cases using the proposed case rates. Additionally, please verify that all systems in both the baseline and proposed case are modeled with zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case).

The situation becomes a bit more complicated in you have systems that have demand controlled ventilation (often implemented as Carbon Dioxide control of outdoor air or as programmed control of outdoor air based on occupancy sensors.) In this case the Baseline case energy model must include the minimum outdoor air as determined by the ASHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate Procedure calculations for all systems having demand controlled ventilation.

The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems that do have demand controlled ventilation:

Demand control ventilation was modeled for credit in the proposed case. Appendix G allows schedule changes for demand control ventilation as approved by the rating authority (Table G3.1#4(Baseline)). As the LEED Certification rating authority, GBCI requires that the outside air ventilation rates for the Baseline case be modeled using minimum ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or 2007 for LEED-NC 2009 projects) rates wherever credit is taken for demand control ventilation in the Proposed case. The proposed case minimum rates at design conditions should be modeled as designed. Please verify that the Baseline Case model reflects ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or 2007) minimum rates for any spaces where credit is taken for demand control ventilation, or revise the model accordingly. For all other spaces, please confirm that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed cases. Additionally, please verify that all systems in both the baseline and proposed cases are modeled with zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case).

Finally, even though you don't address energy recovery in your question, whether or not you have energy recovery in your ventilation systems may affect how much better (or worse) your Proposed case energy models perform in relation to your Baseline case energy models.

The following generic LEED Review Comment addresses energy recovery in EAc1 energy models as it relates to ventilation systems.

Energy recovery is modeled for credit in the Proposed case. Please provide further information regarding the energy recovery efficiency, verify that outside air is modeled with zero flow in both the Baseline and Proposed cases during unoccupied periods when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed Case), and indicate the bypass mechanism used to bypass the energy recovery during mild conditions.

I hope that helps, but if you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to use the contact form at http://www.gbci.org/contactus and select "Follow up to GBCI Response," inputting your case number from this email's subject line.

CUSTOMER INQUIRY:
I am trying to verify what the minimum outdoor airflow rate required for EAc1 is and am not sure if this requires a CIR.

If the Proposed outdoor air ventilation is a minimum of 30% higher than the minimum required by ASHRAE 62 in order to achieve 1 LEED point for credit IEQC2 is the Baseline outdoor air rate also 30% higher than the minimum required by ASHRAE 62? or would the Baseline outdoor air ventilation rate be the minimum outdoor air rate per ASHRAE 62 calculations.

In other words, if ASHRAE 62 requires a minimum of 1,000 CFM of outdoor air, and 1,300 CFM is provided to attain 1 LEED point via IEQC1, is the Baseline outdoor air flow rate 1,000 CFM or 1,300 CFM in the energy simulation?

90.1-2007/2004 both say the minimu    m outdoor airflow rates shall be the same for both the proposed and baseline building designs, as does the user manual.

But this logic seems to reward the Proposed simulation by conditioning the additional outdoor air supplied (300 cfm in the example above) to achieve IEQC1 in the Baseline system as well as the proposed.

The logic of using the minimum required in the Baseline case is reflected in EAC1 in the equipment efficiency requirements. Baseline efficiencies are the minimum required, e.g. SEER 13 for packaged units.

It is the intent of the requirement that I am not sure is clear. Increasing the outdoor air ventilation rate increases the energy used to condition the outdoor air, so if the intent is to put the onus on Proposed design to show energy reduction/LEED compliance over the 90.1/62 requirements shouldn't the Baseline outdoor air be the minimum air flow rate per the ASHRAE 62 calculations? This puts the onus on the design team to provide a design that compensates for the increase in energy to meet IEQC2 by providing some method of processing the increase in outdoor air while still reducing energy consumption.

Philip:  One clarification - the energy code and 62.1 don?t decide if the HVAC system needs to run to provide heating or cooling. Bill?s excerpt states that if the HVAC system is going to operate due to heating/cooling/schedule, then you have to maintain at least the area component of the ventilation air. As he mentions pertaining to the proposed addendum, it seems to make sense to many of us that if occupancy is zero then the outside air might also be zero during that time, even for the area component. Otherwise why would you be allowed to turn the unit off?

Your laboratory case might also have ventilation due to contaminants to consider which could supersede the 62.1 area component pretty easily anyway. Food storage is a different issue. First off, you might need to decide if the space is really an occupied space and does ASHRAE 62.1 apply, or if it is unoccupied storage. (Still conditioned!) Obviously the temperature/humidity requirements of the food, would determine if the HVAC system runs all of the time or not.

Brendan:  Not sure about discretionary ? most building codes or similar regulations will (must?) be absolute ? requiring use of the standard as issued on a certain date, or including all addendums as of the current date. LEED is one of the few exceptions that allows the designer to choose whether to use an addendum or not, and skip over intermediate addenda. So if the local code was more stringent than LEED (even for a more recent version of the same ASHRAE standard) it might not be discretionary? I?m not sure about Ohio?s specific requirements, maybe they do allow discretion.

A high school science lab in phoenix for example simply cannot be left without ventilation or cooling on a 105?F evening occupied or not.

Subject: Re: [Equest-users] [Bldg-rate] [Bldg-sim] usgbc response to outdoor air question

Let me go ahead and confuse things further: IEQp1 requires that:

? Mechanical ventilation systems must be designed using the ventilation rate procedure as defined by ASHRAE 62.1-2007, or the applicable local code, whichever is more stringent.?

So if your project is in a state that has adopted 62.1-2010 (such as OH) , then that is the standard you should be referencing. Which addenda you apply is at your discretion.

90.1 is very insistent that unless a building is intended to operate 24hrs a day, the system should not be running when the building is not occupied. I take that as what is intended by the phrase ?expected to be occupied?. The control on individual spaces on occupancy while the whole building is in occupied mode would be a separate matter where I can understand wanting to cover the area component.

I guess I?ve never heard anyone push the idea that building types such as schools or libraries should be ventilated 24hrs a day so that makes me a bit skeptical of a interpretation that would lead down that path.

Dennis,
Attached is an interpretation from ASHRAE indicating the area based ventilation rate cannot be turned off during unoccupied hours (applicable to 2007 and 2010). Subsequently, ASHRAE is in the process of issuing an addendum that does allow the area based rate to be turned off based on occupancy controls. The addendum (also attached) went out for public review last spring. I don?t see that it has been published on the ASHRAE website yet, so I?m not sure whether it has been fully approved by the committee yet.

Also, in my experience, LEED (v2009) requires that the baseline ventilation rate comply with the ASHRAE 62.1 minimum when DCV controls are implemented in the proposed design for spaces not required to have it per 90.1. This would be the only scenario where baseline ventilation rates differ from the proposed (i.e. no energy penalty for over ventilating). This changes for LEED v4 which used 90.1-2010.

Bill

Please see the following relevant quote from 62.1 2010:

ASHRAE 62.1-2010 may be viewed online for free from the ASHRAE website at: https://www.ashrae.org/standards-research--technology/standards--guidelines.  Its a little slow and painful to view and navigate since it is a free.

Also, all approved addenda may be downloaded in PDF from here: https://www.ashrae.org/standards-research--technology/standards-addenda.

I reviewed both documents and did not see any rulings, interpretations or addenda that would indicate that the area based portion of the ventilation rate is required to operate 24/7 or during unoccupied periods.  If anyone has a better resource than this please post.
Thanks,

Ok, so I received this comment.  The one with the provide ASHRAE minimums in the Baseline for spaces with DCV.  I understand this is a generic comment - Ok.
However, LEED IEQ Credit 2 is not being pursued and the ASHRAE minimum ventilation requirements are what is being Proposed for in each space that has DCV.

Does this not mean that the Baseline ventilation rate and the Proposed ventilation rate will still be equal?
Not sure how to respond other than to simply say what is stated here.

Thanks,
Kevin

RE:  ?. . . can?t find) anything in 621.1 which says that unoccupied ventilation should be zero.?

I think this requirement comes from the mandatory provisions of 90.1.

6.4.3.4.3 Shutoff Damper Controls. Both outdoor
air supply and exhaust systems shall be equipped with motorized
dampers that will automatically shut when the systems or
spaces served are not in use. Ventilation outdoor air dampers
shall be capable of automatically shutting off during preoccupancy
building warm-up, cool down, and setback, except
when ventilation reduces energy costs (e.g., night purge) or
when ventilation must be supplied to meet code requirements.

Thoughts??

Dear Patrick,

Thank you for sharing this GBCI response!  It is very informative and, while I won?t admit that I?ve been modeling anything incorrectly, I am going to change a couple of things ?.
In particular, I have heard on several occasions that the Increased Ventilation credit was a clear case of ?IEQ vs. energy?; you make a decision to trade one against the other.  After reading the GBCI response below and then double-checking with ASHRAE 90.1, I find that they are consistent with each other and effectively allow no penalty for the increased energy caused by increased ventilation.  Very curious, considering there is no science which demonstrates a health benefit for outdoor airflows greater than that required by ASHRAE 62.1!
The other item is that I failed to notice (and still can?t find) anything in 621.1 which says that unoccupied ventilation should be zero.  I guess that is OK, but is also curious, since a portion of the ventilation calcs in 62.1 include consideration for off-gassing materials (which are always present.)
All in all, I?m smarter than I was as a result of your post, so it?s a good day!  Thanks again.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] usgbc response to outdoor air question

back in september there was a thread about what the outdoor air rate in a baseline simulation should be compared to a proposed simulation, specifically when one is adding 30% more outdoor air to meet the ieqc2 requirement and earn 1 leed point.  there were differences of opinions about the flow rates between baseline and proposed being either the same (as required in 90.1 app g) or the baseline being the calculated per 62.1 and the proposed being as designed.

so i submitted a support request to the usgbc and the reply i received is below, but in short the response is that unless you're using dcv optionally the outdoor air rates in the baseline and proposed energy simulations for eac1 should be the same.  the response below gives the standard responses to differing outdoor air rate scenarios.

Dear Patrick,

Thank you for contacting the Green Building Certification Institute.

You ask very good questions related to the relationship between ASHRAE Standards 62.1 and 90.1, and how these standards are applied across multiple LEED Rating System prerequisites and credits.

The simple answer to your question is that, for systems without demand controlled ventilation, the outdoor air included in EA Credit 1 energy simulations must be the same in the Baseline and Proposed cases. If the project is attempting IEQ Credit 2 Increased Ventilation, then the values calculated in IEQc2 must be used in the EAc1 Basline and Proposed case energy models. Note that IEQc2 does not limit the project to providing only 30% more outdoor air than AHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate Procedure minimums, so higher amounts are acceptable, as long as they are modeled identically in both the Baseline and Proposed case energy models.

The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems that do not have demand controlled ventilation:

It is unclear whether the minimum outside air rates (in CFM) were modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case for all zones not having Demand Control Ventilation in the Proposed case. Please confirm that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed cases using the proposed case rates. Additionally, please verify that all systems in both the baseline and proposed case are modeled with zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case).

The situation becomes a bit more complicated in you have systems that have demand controlled ventilation (often implemented as Carbon Dioxide control of outdoor air or as programmed control of outdoor air based on occupancy sensors.) In this case the Baseline case energy model must include the minimum outdoor air as determined by the ASHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate Procedure calculations for all systems having demand controlled ventilation.

The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems that do have demand controlled ventilation:

Demand control ventilation was modeled for credit in the proposed case. Appendix G allows schedule changes for demand control ventilation as approved by the rating authority (Table G3.1#4(Baseline)). As the LEED Certification rating authority, GBCI requires that the outside air ventilation rates for the Baseline case be modeled using minimum ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or 2007 for LEED-NC 2009 projects) rates wherever credit is taken for demand control ventilation in the Proposed case. The proposed case minimum rates at design conditions should be modeled as designed. Please verify that the Baseline Case model reflects ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or 2007) minimum rates for any spaces where credit is taken for demand control ventilation, or revise the model accordingly. For all other spaces, please confirm that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed cases. Additionally, please verify that all systems in both the baseline and proposed cases are modeled with zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case).

Finally, even though you don't address energy recovery in your question, whether or not you have energy recovery in your ventilation systems may affect how much better (or worse) your Proposed case energy models perform in relation to your Baseline case energy models.

The following generic LEED Review Comment addresses energy recovery in EAc1 energy models as it relates to ventilation systems.

Energy recovery is modeled for credit in the Proposed case. Please provide further information regarding the energy recovery efficiency, verify that outside air is modeled with zero flow in both the Baseline and Proposed cases during unoccupied periods when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed Case), and indicate the bypass mechanism used to bypass the energy recovery during mild conditions.

I hope that helps, but if you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to use the contact form at http://www.gbci.org/contactus and select "Follow up to GBCI Response," inputting your case number from this email's subject line.

The text above represents a staff opinion of a particular issue, and does NOT set any precedent to be upheld during a LEED Certification Review. For official rulings in advance of a LEED Certification Review, customers should utilize the Formal Inquiries process available in LEED Online that results in a Project Credit Interpretation Ruling (Project CIR) and possibly a LEED Interpretation (formerly CIRs or Public Rulings). Applications for LEED Certification will be thoroughly reviewed based on USGBC Member balloted and approved LEED Rating Systems, with addenda, and USGBC approved LEED Interpretations, or Project CIRs administered by GBCI, as applicable. Please note that certain inquiries submitted to USGBC are forwarded to GBCI for reply as appropriate.

CUSTOMER INQUIRY:
I am trying to verify what the minimum outdoor airflow rate required for EAc1 is and am not sure if this requires a CIR.

If the Proposed outdoor air ventilation is a minimum of 30% higher than the minimum required by ASHRAE 62 in order to achieve 1 LEED point for credit IEQC2 is the Baseline outdoor air rate also 30% higher than the minimum required by ASHRAE 62? or would the Baseline outdoor air ventilation rate be the minimum outdoor air rate per ASHRAE 62 calculations.

In other words, if ASHRAE 62 requires a minimum of 1,000 CFM of outdoor air, and 1,300 CFM is provided to attain 1 LEED point via IEQC1, is the Baseline outdoor air flow rate 1,000 CFM or 1,300 CFM in the energy simulation?

90.1-2007/2004 both say the minimu    m outdoor airflow rates shall be the same for both the proposed and baseline building designs, as does the user manual.

But this logic seems to reward the Proposed simulation by conditioning the additional outdoor air supplied (300 cfm in the example above) to achieve IEQC1 in the Baseline system as well as the proposed.

The logic of using the minimum required in the Baseline case is reflected in EAC1 in the equipment efficiency requirements. Baseline efficiencies are the minimum required, e.g. SEER 13 for packaged units.

It is the intent of the requirement that I am not sure is clear. Increasing the outdoor air ventilation rate increases the energy used to condition the outdoor air, so if the intent is to put the onus on Proposed design to show energy reduction/LEED compliance over the 90.1/62 requirements shouldn't the Baseline outdoor air be the minimum air flow rate per the ASHRAE 62 calculations? This puts the onus on the design team to provide a design that compensates for the increase in energy to meet IEQC2 by providing some method of processing the increase in outdoor air while still reducing energy consumption.

Hi

I was trying to predict the chiller set points with the help of DOE -
2 equations. I was able to obtain the coefficients and I used EIRFT to
predict the optimal set point to be maintained in the chiller. I tried
to calculate it back from predicted EIR. Is it the right way to do?.
Can you please explain me as to how we can predict the optimal set
point for chillers. I have been trying a lot to predict the set points
and have read a paper on Model Predictive control of HVAC systems in
UC merced campus but I am not clear on the algorithms which they have
used to predict the set points. I have attached the excel sheet in
this mail. Please help me in predicting the set points.

Thanks a lot for helping me out.

Dear all,

I am building (and simulating) a zero energy renovation project (www.zehr.be).
We apply a bunch of new technologies, that will be measured.

My contractor has sent a team if Polish workers, who speak French as well.
It works really well, but I want to explain them the concept of passive and
zero energy buildings by providing a text in their mother tongue.

I have found bits and pieces on blower door testing (even on desalination
of old walls), but have no clue where to find a practice-oriented handbook
or website in Polish.

Can anyone guide me (my Polish is limited to the name of tools, yes and
no, and the polite good morning)?

Leen (and the construction team)

The 1988 paper is available at 
http://www.whiteboxtechnologies.com/PAPERS/88_YJH_etal_Fdn_Model.pdf

There was a discussion a few months back on the EnergyPlus_Support bulletin board on 
F-factors that you might be interested to read (go back to April 24-25).  Here is what I 
had posted at that time:

-----
Jean, others,

It was quite a surprise to read your e-mail and find that the old F-Factors that I 
calculated back in 1988 are still being referred to in Standard 90.1.  If you're 
interested in more details of that effort, there's an ASHRAE Transaction paper

Huang, Y.J., L.S. Shen, J.C. Bull, and L.F. Goldberg 1988. "Whole-house simulation of 
foundation heat-flows using the DOE-2 program", /ASHRAE Transactions/, Vol. 94-2.

and a 1998 User News article written by Fred Winkelmann on its implementation in DOE-2 ( 
http://www.whiteboxtechnologies.com/PAPERS/Fdn_modeling_user_news_articles02-2.pdf )

The F-Factors are per lineal feet of perimeter from Tout to Tin of the space containing 
the foundation. There are actually several ways to implement this model: (1) model a 
monolithic foundation as an exterior wall and adjust the R-value of the layer so that  U*A 
= F*PL (Perimeter length) -- this is the method shown in the Winkelmann article,  (2) 
decompose the foundation into two regions - a perimeter strip 1-2 ft wide and a core for 
the remainder; model the perimeter as an exterior wall, adjusting its R-value accordingly, 
but model the core as an adiabatic layer.  When I was working with DOE-2, there was a 
practical problem that layers can't be too thick or the response factor would fail, so I 
could only add at most 2.5 ft of soil. I don't know if EnergyPlus has similar 
limitations.  Ideally, you would want to model as much soil as possible to get the thermal 
dampening effect.

The main deficiencies with this technique are (1) Tout is the outside air temperature, (2) 
the foundation is treated as a single layer.  I know there's a temptation to model the 
foundation as a underground layer tied to the soil temperature, but that would be wrong 
since the F-Factors were calculated air-to-air.

In the late 90's (1998-2000), I worked with Fred Winkelmann and Vladimir Bazjanac for the 
Calif. Energy Commission to develop what I think is a much better model that is now the 
approved method for Title-24. This model uses a similar approach as before,  except 
instead of a single F-Factor, there are six Foundation Conductances for two domains 
(perimeter and core) and three heat flow paths ("quick" to the outdoor air temperature the 
past 3 weeks, "slow" to the  monthly ground temperature, and "constant" to the deep ground 
temperature). The model is not only more accurate, but  more flexible for different 
building conditions. If anyone's interested in the report, it's available at 
www.whiteboxtechnologies.com/downloads/00_02.YJH.CEC_Fdn_Model.pdf

If I have it in my power, I would urge everyone to stop using the 1988 model and switch to 
the 2000 model, but since the F-Factors seem to have been institutionalized by now, that 
would be irresponsible. So, I'll be happy to answer questions about the use of either model.

Joe - on this topic:

I was involved with a string of large footprint facilities in cavern spaces, where the floors and ceilings were effectively un-insulated limestone, far underground.  For the purpose of determining building loads to size equipment, we were able to make a set of comfortable assumptions with respect to the surrounding air conditions and perimeter losses, but the challenge of determining an appropriate constant heat loss through the substantial rock floor/ceiling surfaces proved an uncertain venture.

Deciding the extent to which those losses should slow (or not) over time as the conditioned facility warms up the surrounding earth further complicated some comparative ROI assessments for conditioning equipment options.

In hindsight (and having not yet absorbed the linked literature), this more nuanced 2000 era approach which separately addresses the perimeter and core losses seems like a great stride towards addressing such concerns.  In advance of familiarizing myself with this approach, are you aware of any publicly available tools/software packages utilizing this method that could be leveraged for load calculations in a similar scenario?  Would you suggest a different approach?

I've said this before but not nearly as often as it crossed my mind:  thank you for your ever-helpful contributions!

~Nick

I use EnergyPro for LEED.  It can do either CA T-24 or 90.1 and is 
accepted by USGBC.  From what I can tell, it can be used in CA or 
elsewhere.  EnergySoft has a new module which provides pdf files which 
appear to be identical to the new LEED forms.  I'm not sure that the 
module has been released yet, but I have been allowed to use it.  The 
forms printed out automatically are precisely identical to the LEED 
forms requirements.  I have copied Martyn Dodd of EnergySoft on this post.

Martyn has told me that USGBC will accept the EnergyPro forms as 
submittals for LEED certification and I am doing that now with an 
apartment building that I am working on.  He is copied on this post.

I have expanded the question.

 

Is there information on the use of energy programs (EnergyPlus, eQUEST,
TRACE, HAP, IESVE, TRNSYS, etc.) used for code compliance and LEED
certification? 

Is there statistical information comparing the predicted energy usage by
these energy programs and actual energy consumption measured on site? 

Does code authorities and LEED USGBC check energy program predictions
against actual usage?

 

With Building Management Systems, the computer can record the actual energy
use and a program can show the deviation from predicted.  Sub-metering will
show energy use of components (CHW, HW & AHU systems, etc.)

If you agree to monitor the building under EAc5, "Measurement and 
Verification" this is done and USGBC gets the data.

Rasheed,



I think Dr. Ugursal can help with this as his thesis investigated several of these topics.

The population of America is about 300 million, Europe's (Western, Eastern,
and Russia) is about 700 million, and in Japan and Korea it is about 200
million.  There are about another 800 million in the rest of the world
(China, India, Brazil, etc.) with same standard of living.  This represents
less than 30% of the world's population of 7,000 million.  However, this 30%
use almost all of the earth's resources and is responsible for almost all of
the industrial pollution and global warming.  

 

There is no population growth in the 30% segment of the population with a
high (energy wasting) standard of living, but their energy use per capita is
escalating at faster rate than the population which is escalating at an
alarming rate.  If the other 70% population were to reach the same standard
of living as the energy wasters and polluters (the 30% segment) we would
have to consider "Global Heating".   Standard of living might curb
population growth but it results in escalating energy use and atmospheric
pollution.

 

Industrial pollution would make life impossible on this planet if the other
70% of the world's population (which is escalating) were to reach the living
standards of the existing 30%.  Industrial pollution is not the main threat.
At the present rate of human population growth, forests, vegetation, and
most large animal life will be devastated in a few hundred years.  This has
happened in the past as with the dinosaurs.  

 

Uncontrolled human population growth has destroyed forests and vegetation.
It is responsible for destroying animal life as well, particularly the large
mammals that require large amounts of forest and grassland to survive.
Tigers, lions, elephants, giraffes, rhinos and hippos are going join
dinosaurs as interesting science education in schools.  Humans will soon be
competing for space on this planet only with rats, cockroaches, flies, and
insects.  History has shown that the smaller creature will win.

Message-ID: <421439FA9B193547A80AA924D0A041903996A114@SVKJWWMAIL2.ad.kjww.com>

All, I have an ASHRAE 90.1-2007 question that I've run into while completing an energy model.

ASHRAE 90.1-2007 section 6.4.3.9 is a mandatory provision for demand control ventilation in densely occupied zones.

Exception 9.4.3.9(a) reads, "Systems with energy recovery complying with Section 6.5.6.1."

6.5.6.1. Exhaust Air Energy Recovery. Individual fan systems that have both a design supply air capacity of 5000 cfm or greater and have a minimum outdoor air supply of 70% or greater of the design supply air quantity shall have an energy recovery system with at least 50% recovery effectiveness. Fifty percent energy recovery effectiveness shall mean a change in the enthalpy of the outdoor air supply equal to 50% of the difference between the outdoor air and the return air at design conditions. Provision shall be made to bypass or control the heat recovery system to permit air economizer operation as required by Section 6.5.1.1.

My question: If I have a system that's only 20% outside air but complies with the remainder of 6.5.6.1, can I still use exception 9.4.3.9(a) to avoid DCV in densely occupied zones? Or does that exception only apply to those systems with 70% OA or more?

Thank you!

Stormy,

By my reading of exception 6.4.3.9(a) and 6.5.6.1, you can avoid the DCV requirement if you have a system with energy recovery that has 50% recovery effectiveness and that has bypass/control to permit economizer operation. The 5000 cfm & 70% OA (>3500 cfm OA) are the Prescriptive Path criteria for requiring energy recovery, and don't align with 6.4.3.9, which applies for systems with >3000 cfm OA. The wording in 90.1-2010 for 6.5.6.1 makes this more clear, IMO.

Bill

Varkie,

Yes.
We need to make "standard of living" distinct from energy intensity. Carbon diets all around.
Being a stickler for numbers (and having researched this for a Climate Change presentation I'm doing next week) I modified and added to your table, using data from this website<http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/>. Population growth has been nearly linear over the past 30 to 40 years and is expected to level off at 10 bn.

Hi Gang:
?
I need to elite for this one, and you know who you are..
?
I am reviewing another party's eQuest model submitted for LEED. The reviewer noted that the roof area far exceeded the actual building footprint.
?
Well, guess why? Somehow, the other party made several floors ROOFS instead of ceilings. I might be able to simply turn the exterior spaces into interior ceilings, but one roof (over an unheated underground garage) is partially uder the building and partially exposed to the "sidewalk/entrance" of the building.
?
The BIG Kahuena is this..if a space is crammed next to an adjacent space and one of the spaces claims an Exterioir surface between them, does DOE-2 think that Exterior surface is seeing outdoor conditions? Or does it ignore such a thin and merely considers the heat transfer between the spaces (like the wall/roof is NOT exposed to the outdoors)?
?
My approach is this (unless you disagree)..leave the Exterior wall/roof along and explain that the model (now in Detailed Edit form) would need major surgery to correct to show actual roof area. Having the "roofs" there versus floors will not change the thermodynamics of heat transfer.
?
I yield to the floor.
?

this sounds like you have multiple shells in one model for this to 
occur?  i'm pretty sure equest views an exterior wall/roof as an 
exterior wall/roof even if it is bounded by an interior wall.  i had 
this problem come up on one of my own models where i ended up having a 
building wing meet the building trunk & as i had put them in as 2 
separate shells equest did not recognize the dividing wall where the 
wing met the trunk as being an interior wall & assigned it (via the 
wizard) an exterior wall definition.  i didn't catch this until 
reviewing the unmet load hour ss-r & s-va reports & couldn't figure out 
why the load was so high.  changed the definition of the wall to 
interior (with a door) in detailed mode and the unmet load hours went to 
zero and the load came down.

my understanding (in my case) is that if you create multiple shells and 
place them with a common wall that you want to be an interior the shell 
rotations need to be zero, even if you have the separation between the 
two shells occur at a 45 deg angle (then ask mr. architect about that one).

John,

 

Having extra exterior roof area is a fairly common mistake in eQUEST models
involving multiple shells. It typically originates on DD Wizard Screen 3,
when roof construction is specified in the Construction list box for a shell
that has no roof (i.e. shell that includes only the middle floors of the
building), instead of setting it to "-no exterior exposure (adiabatic)".
Any exterior surface in eQUEST will conduct heat between the parent space
and the ambient, even if it is adjacent to another conditioned space based
on 3D view, so having extra roof area does affect simulation results. The
easiest way to fix the problem is to delete the extra exterior roof
surfaces. Converting them to interior walls as Patrick suggested is a more
precise approach, but is also more time consuming and will have negligible
impact on results for most projects, especially if the result of interest is
Appendix G performance rating. 

 

Thanks,

 

Maria

I am reviewing another party's eQuest model submitted for LEED. The reviewer

Well, guess why? Somehow, the other party made several floors ROOFS instead
of ceilings. I might be able to simply turn the exterior spaces into
interior ceilings, but one roof (over an unheated underground garage) is
partially uder the building and partially exposed to the "sidewalk/entrance"
of the building.

 

The BIG Kahuena is this..if a space is crammed next to an adjacent space and
one of the spaces claims an Exterioir surface between them, does DOE-2 think
that Exterior surface is seeing outdoor conditions? Or does it ignore such a
thin and merely considers the heat transfer between the spaces (like the
wall/roof is NOT exposed to the outdoors)?

 

My approach is this (unless you disagree)..leave the Exterior wall/roof
along and explain that the model (now in Detailed Edit form) would need
major surgery to correct to show actual roof area. Having the "roofs" there
versus floors will not change the thermodynamics of heat transfer.

 

I yield to the floor.

If you did opt for conversion, it is probably easier to do so in the INP file than detailed interface.

Adding a bunch of ceilings will also require matching floors for "adjacent-to" surfaces - just deleting sounds easier.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Above Grade External Wall Area Weighted U-value
	Calculation
Message-ID: <026e01cebd31$6c76df60$45649e20$@gmail.com>

Dear All,

I have submitted a project for review and received a comment requesting me
to include the concrete slabs between floors (Not drop beams) in the
External Wall' area weighted U-value calculation, the reviewer believes that
concrete slabs acts as a thermal bridge and should be insulated from the
outer side (The slab thickness), my understanding that concrete slab
shouldn't be regarded as a part of the occupied area and therefore shouldn't
be included in the area weighted U-value calculation.

I would appreciate if you can advise on the above query!

Thanks & Best Regards,

Here are a few more thoughts (gathered in haste because I'm traveling, but on my mind for a while)

*         Humans have clearly mis-managed every resource on the planet - occasionally.

*         As Bill notes, global population is leveling.  Almost every Western country is now below its population rate and is experiencing population decline.  China's population growth has been forced by law to decline for years, Europe is in a particularly sad state, the US is buoyed by immigrants' generally higher rate of having children and even historically high growth groups like Muslims are seeing significantly slowed growth.

*         Humans have (through creativity, ingenuity and need) created a host of technologies and processes that would have been considered black magic only 100 years ago - and have been doing this throughout history.  Their pluses outweigh the minuses dramatically over the course of history!

*         Reduce population and you reduce the amazing and consistent impact of human creativity!  (and while we're at it, consider how you are going to remain part of the powerful group that decides who lives and who dies - it seems to be primarily an exercise of the powerful against those who lack it.  The "Haves" against the "Have-nots".  I don't think it's a simple matter!)

*         There is ample evidence that the worries about "overpopulation" are a myth.  The advocates are well-funded myth promoters (and perhaps power-grabbers), but do not have science substantiating them.  See http://overpopulationisamyth.com/overpopulation-the-making-of-a-myth for some teasers on this topic.

*         "Global warming", which in recent years has become "climate change", seems to be in a similarly unsubstantiated position.  It's easy to find many scientific arguments against human-caused climate change (with many credible supporters), and very few IPCC or other climate change advocates who can refute their challenges.  (See http://petitionproject.org/gw_article/Review_Article_HTML.php for a detailed summary.) A short summary of concerns about climate change might be:

o   Is the global temperature changing? (Yes, as it has throughout history)

o   Is the change bad for humans?  (Maybe. Higher temperatures and associated higher CO2 levels promote plant growth - great for food production!  Greenland used to be ... green during a previous warm period!)

o   Are humans causing climate change? (some evidence says "yes", some says "insignificantly", some says "probably not". The historical data shows that global CO2  levels follow global temperature rise .. by hundreds of years.  How could it be that a following effect causes the first?)

o   Do we know how to reduce the rate of change? (I haven't read the Kyoto Protocol, but it's supposed to have predicted a global temperature reduction of a few hundredths of a degree C if every first world nation adopted its measures.  Not too impressive and not consistent with global cooling in the last decade or so despite increasing CO2 production. I wonder what the uncertainty of that model was?? We all know about the accuracy of "models"!)

*         All of that said, I am not a climate scientist.  I am an engineer who looks for facts, trends and logic.  Most of what I see and read in the population and climate change discussions is "Trust me, I have the support of a big government-funded project", or ad hominem (look it up!) rebuttals.  Since when has science been a "consensus"?  It's a good thing Galileo and Newton and Einstein didn't conduct research by consensus! If the facts are really on your side, they'll stand up to scrutiny.  I'd love to hear a reasoned debate by knowledgeable people on both sides of these issues, but one of the sides seems curiously un-inclined to debate....

*         P.s., I am also the father of seven children who has marveled at the amazing diversity of insight and talent among my own family.  The potential of children is proven and holds incredible promise for all the rest of us.  It's impossible to predict what they might do, but history demonstrates clearly that they consistently outperform expectations!

Varkie,

Yes.
We need to make "standard of living" distinct from energy intensity. Carbon diets all around.
Being a stickler for numbers (and having researched this for a Climate Change presentation I'm doing next week) I modified and added to your table, using data from this website<http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/>. Population growth has been nearly linear over the past 30 to 40 years and is expected to level off at 10 bn.

The population of America is about 300 million, Europe's (Western, Eastern, and Russia) is about 700 million, and in Japan and Korea it is about 200 million.  There are about another 800 million in the rest of the world (China, India, Brazil, etc.) with same standard of living.  This represents less than 30% of the world's population of 7,000 million.  However, this 30% use almost all of the earth's resources and is responsible for almost all of the industrial pollution and global warming.



There is no population growth in the 30% segment of the population with a high (energy wasting) standard of living, but their energy use per capita is escalating at faster rate than the population which is escalating at an alarming rate.  If the other 70% population were to reach the same standard of living as the energy wasters and polluters (the 30% segment) we would have to consider "Global Heating".   Standard of living might curb population growth but it results in escalating energy use and atmospheric pollution.



Industrial pollution would make life impossible on this planet if the other 70% of the world's population (which is escalating) were to reach the living standards of the existing 30%.  Industrial pollution is not the main threat.  At the present rate of human population growth, forests, vegetation, and most large animal life will be devastated in a few hundred years.  This has happened in the past as with the dinosaurs.



Uncontrolled human population growth has destroyed forests and vegetation.  It is responsible for destroying animal life as well, particularly the large mammals that require large amounts of forest and grassland to survive.  Tigers, lions, elephants, giraffes, rhinos and hippos are going join dinosaurs as interesting science education in schools.  Humans will soon be competing for space on this planet only with rats, cockroaches, flies, and insects.  History has shown that the smaller creature will win.

John,

I can comment only on the DOE-2 side of things.  When you say "one of 
the spaces claims an Exterior surface between them",  you must mean just 
by geometrical
proximity, not explicitly with a "NEXT-TO" command ?   Because as far as 
I'm aware, only an INTERIOR-WALL can have a NEXT-TO command.  If these 
roofs are specified as EXTERIOR-WALLs or ROOFs (the only difference is 
the default TILT), they can't have a NEXT-TO and will be modeled as 
exposed to the exterior environment, including solar.  Self-shading from 
other exterior-walls will be considered only if those are specified as 
shading surfaces (though I've forgotten exactly how that's done 
SHADING-SURFACE = YES ?).

What the reviewer said is technically correct, but not often done in 
simple UA calculations because of the difficulty is calculating U-values 
for such thermal bridging.
The effects can be substantial, especially for heavy-mass concrete 
construction. I've seen in China there's a standard method to account 
for thermal bridging in calculating wall U-values. Have not seen a 
similar technique for the US, don't know about the situation in Europe.

Varkie,

I'm going to say something that might rankle others on this bulletin board.
The main take-away I get from your post (but something I've felt all along),
is that in respect to energy efficiency and carbon mitigation, the developed
countries are still the source of the problem, and not the solution (at 
least
not yet).  Therefore, those of us working in green buildings, building 
energy
efficiency, etc., should still maintain a healthy dose of humility and 
not have
that air of moral superiority I often detect at international conferences.

Joe

Varkie,

Yes.
We need to make "standard of living" distinct from energy intensity. Carbon diets all around.
Being a stickler for numbers (and having researched this for a Climate Change presentation I'm doing next week) I modified and added to your table, using data from this website<http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/>. Population growth has been nearly linear over the past 30 to 40 years and is expected to level off at 10 bn.

Increasing transportation and building energy use is not going to save the planet.
It requires controlling the human population growth.

The population of America is about 300 million, Europe's (Western, Eastern, and Russia) is about 700 million, and in Japan and Korea it is about 200 million.  There are about another 800 million in the rest of the world (China, India, Brazil, etc.) with same standard of living.  This represents less than 30% of the world's population of 7,000 million.  However, this 30% use almost all of the earth's resources and is responsible for almost all of the industrial pollution and global warming.



There is no population growth in the 30% segment of the population with a high (energy wasting) standard of living, but their energy use per capita is escalating at faster rate than the population which is escalating at an alarming rate.  If the other 70% population were to reach the same standard of living as the energy wasters and polluters (the 30% segment) we would have to consider "Global Heating".   Standard of living might curb population growth but it results in escalating energy use and atmospheric pollution.



Industrial pollution would make life impossible on this planet if the other 70% of the world's population (which is escalating) were to reach the living standards of the existing 30%.  Industrial pollution is not the main threat.  At the present rate of human population growth, forests, vegetation, and most large animal life will be devastated in a few hundred years.  This has happened in the past as with the dinosaurs.



Uncontrolled human population growth has destroyed forests and vegetation.  It is responsible for destroying animal life as well, particularly the large mammals that require large amounts of forest and grassland to survive.  Tigers, lions, elephants, giraffes, rhinos and hippos are going join dinosaurs as interesting science education in schools.  Humans will soon be competing for space on this planet only with rats, cockroaches, flies, and insects.  History has shown that the smaller creature will win.

If the "roofs" don't have a zone as the outside boundary condition, then
the model views them as roofs exposed to the exterior.  You need to fix
this. If the spaces on the other side have the same thermostat setpoints,
then the easiest thing to do is set the roof type to "adiabatic". This will
save you from having to define new polygons if the floor above has
different zone shapes.  For a roof that is only partially covered by the
floor above, you need to create the new polygons. Sorry.

ISO has a standard methodology for accounting for thermal bridging as
described in ISO 10221 and it is a standard part of using the ISO 13790
methodology for heating/cooling calculations.  ASHRAE has researched a
similar method which is described in ASHRAE Research Project 1365-RP
?Thermal Performance of Building Envelope Details for Mid- and High-Rise
Buildings?   I don't know if this is going to lead to an ASHRAE standard or
not.

That said, the ISO method is not a US standard and doesn't have ANSI or
ASHRAE equivalents,  Further,  I don't know of any specific code/energy
standard requirements to use the ISO standard.

Agreed, make the change in the .inp file for the appropriate shells.

It helps to give the incorrect roofs a different construction so you can search them more easily. Also, save a copy of the .inp file before making your edits. I?ve found it?s too easy to make a mistake in the .inp file that corrupts the whole model.

It is unfortunately a very common mistake in the wizard that is a pain to fix in the detailed mode, but that?s the best way I know how to correct the problem.

If you did opt for conversion, it is probably easier to do so in the INP file than detailed interface.

Adding a bunch of ceilings will also require matching floors for "adjacent-to" surfaces - just deleting sounds easier.

John,

Having extra exterior roof area is a fairly common mistake in eQUEST models involving multiple shells. It typically originates on DD Wizard Screen 3, when roof construction is specified in the Construction list box for a shell that has no roof (i.e. shell that includes only the middle floors of the building), instead of setting it to ?-no exterior exposure (adiabatic)?.  Any exterior surface in eQUEST will conduct heat between the parent space and the ambient, even if it is adjacent to another conditioned space based on 3D view, so having extra roof area does affect simulation results. The easiest way to fix the problem is to delete the extra exterior roof surfaces. Converting them to interior walls as Patrick suggested is a more precise approach, but is also more time consuming and will have negligible impact on results for most projects, especially if the result of interest is Appendix G performance rating.

Thanks,

Maria

this sounds like you have multiple shells in one model for this to occur?  i'm pretty sure equest views an exterior wall/roof as an exterior wall/roof even if it is bounded by an interior wall.  i had this problem come up on one of my own models where i ended up having a building wing meet the building trunk & as i had put them in as 2 separate shells equest did not recognize the dividing wall where the wing met the trunk as being an interior wall & assigned it (via the wizard) an exterior wall definition.  i didn't catch this until reviewing the unmet load hour ss-r & s-va reports & couldn't figure out why the load was so high.  changed the definition of the wall to interior (with a door) in detailed mode and the unmet load hours went to zero and the load came down.

my understanding (in my case) is that if you create multiple shells and place them with a common wall that you want to be an interior the shell rotations need to be zero, even if you have the separation between the two shells occur at a 45 deg angle (then ask mr. architect about that one).

It isn't like the reviewer is making things up, I think it is pretty clear from the language of 90.1 Appendix G that you have to account for these exposed slab edges. Frankly 90.1-2007 is a little more forgiving, allowing for area-weighted U-factors for the entire wall, I believe previous versions of Appendix G (2004 for example) actually specifically required that you model uninsulated assemblies as their own discrete wall types. See excerpts below:

ASHARE 90.1-2007 Appendix G:
[cid:image002.png at 01CEBDBC.188EDC00]

ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G:
[cid:image006.jpg at 01CEBDBC.188EDC00]
We usually model the slab edges as separate walls (only about 1 foot high) and make the other walls "shorter" when you take out this area. If you don't do this in the wizard, you can set up a macro in the .inp to to it, but it takes a bit of work. Frankly if you already have the model set up without slab areas, it seems much easier to to do the weighted U-factor calculation.

It isn't like the reviewer is making things up, I think it is pretty clear
from the language of 90.1 Appendix G that you have to account for these
exposed slab edges. Frankly 90.1-2007 is a little more forgiving, allowing
for area-weighted U-factors for the entire wall, I believe previous versions
of Appendix G (2004 for example) actually specifically required that you
model uninsulated assemblies as their own discrete wall types. See excerpts
below:

 

ASHARE 90.1-2007 Appendix G:


 

ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G:



We usually model the slab edges as separate walls (only about 1 foot high)
and make the other walls "shorter" when you take out this area. If you don't
do this in the wizard, you can set up a macro in the .inp to to it, but it
takes a bit of work. Frankly if you already have the model set up without
slab areas, it seems much easier to to do the weighted U-factor calculation.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Above Grade External Wall Area Weighted U-value
Calculation

 

Dear All,

I have submitted a project for review and received a comment requesting me
to include the concrete slabs between floors (Not drop beams) in the
External Wall' area weighted U-value calculation, the reviewer believes that
concrete slabs acts as a thermal bridge and should be insulated from the
outer side (The slab thickness), my understanding that concrete slab
shouldn't be regarded as a part of the occupied area and therefore shouldn't
be included in the area weighted U-value calculation.

I would appreciate if you can advise on the above query!

Thanks & Best Regards,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] eQUEST packaged VAV systems
Message-ID: <CACbt1qGa-nwcDE9yd-BkUeys1OCmRw6HLQkWmw793W0xmDjaVQ@mail.gmail.com>

We're modeling a big box retail store with PSZ systems. We'd like to
determine the savings associated with installing a packaged vav system.
We're having a hard time getting the central heating (furnace) activated
with this system type in eQUEST. We have set the HEAT-SET-T to 95 and
included a heating capacity value. We do not have any zone reheat.  In
cooling mode, we'd like the  DX supply flow to decrease first. In heating
mode, we'd like the supply flow to also decrease first.

We have single zone systems and are not really using these system types
(PVAVS and PVVT) as intended but thought we could get it to work. Any
thoughts about this approach or an equivalent alternative?


Thanks!

Just to clarify, we can't get the furnace working with either the PVAVS or
the PVVT. Also tried with electric as the system heating source with both
systems with no success.
