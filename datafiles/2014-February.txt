Hi everyone!

I am a masters student and doing my masters in electrical engineering. I am currently working on my thesis. My work in related to air conditioning systems in buildings (Non-HVAC) i.e. using the traditional stand alone air conditioners.?

I need to calculate the energy usage of these traditional Air conditioning systems. can anyone suggest me how can i simulate it using any of the simple and free simulation software. Most of the software's i have seen on internet are build for HVAC systems but in my country HVAC system are still very rare so i have to give my analysis on Traditional Air Conditioning units.?
looking forward to a promising response.

Thank You

Message-ID: <20140201110626.55043svuveu6dnoi@webmail.co2engineering.eu>

Dear all,

I am using eQUEST for a LEED project. After the review, I need to  
change the HVAC System from 6 (Packaged VAV with PFP boxes) to 5  
(Packaged VAV with reheat) in the baseline model.

I made the changes as I thought necessary, and although when I open  
the model it gives me no errors (and there are no errors in the "error  
listing"), when I simulate it says that it cannot complete the  
simulation due to errors. In the BDL file, I see "no heating equipment  
has been defined" or "no cooling equipment has been defined".

Do you have any idea why this might be happening? I would appreciate  
any suggestions on how to fix this. I'm happy to provide the INP file  
or give additional information if that helps.

Thank you very much in advance.

Kind regards,

Eleni

Syed, I wouldn't necessarily consider room air-conditioning systems to be "non-HVAC" - the last two letters stand for "air" and "conditioning" after all!

But whatever we want to call it, you can certainly make a model for these types of systems in eQUEST, OpenStudio/EnergyPlus, etc. and other free and fee software packages.

The bigger unknowns for you will probably how to model the buildings rather than the A/C systems, although you may also have some questions about the age and efficiency of the units that you are considering, if you are modeling typical existing units. Availability of data for new units of this type should be easier to acquire.

Depending on what you are doing with the energy usage data that you collect, would it be possible for you to measure the electricity usage for some of these systems in your region instead of model them?

Good luck!

Thank You David for your response?
Yes these are simple air conditioning systems. I want to do this analysis on My university building having about 250 offices and 400 Air conditioners. Basically what i need to do is calculate the energy or electricity usage of an air conditioner if it operates from 9 A.M. in the morning to 6 P.M. in the evening. I don't really want to get into much details of the building constructions etc.?

Actually i am building an occupancy detection system so i need to evaluate that system in terms of the energy that can be saved if Air conditioners are operated based on the occupancy schedules.?

You have mentioned 3 or 4 softwares which one of these can make me do this task easily. i don't have much time so i need some solution that is fast and appropriate.

Eleni,

The best way for any of us to assist you is to look at and troubleshoot your model file,  is to attach the .pd2, .inp, and your weather file if it is unique.

If you can send these through,  I would be happy to look at your model and give you some ideas to fix the problem.

Syed,

If you want to model accurately you will need to get details on the
construction, the appliances, the lighting etc, in order to calculate the
cooling load of your building (= the heat that needs to be removed). This
is especially true considering what you want to model: this is not as
simple as having something that works full blast or doesn't work at all. By
shutting off the AC when no one is in the room, you'll allow the
temperature of the space to go up, which means next time you turn it on
you'll have some extra load to remove at first, and this is highly
dependent of the building construction.

If you don't want to create a detailed model, you could, as David
suggested, do it empirically. For example by choosing two similar rooms
(surface, orientation, but also how they are being used) and two exact AC
models and strap a meter to each one. Let it run for a week's time or so,
and then on only one of the two AC put your occupancy sensor.

By the way, you don't have to model your entire campus. Depending on the
level of accuracy you're trying to reach, you could just model one room and
consider all exchange surfaces to be adiabatic except the external wall.

Good luck!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Market Assessment on Building Simulation
Message-ID: <46cb50212d454aaaa24d0dbde6e19193@DM2PR04MB493.namprd04.prod.outlook.com>

BLDG-SIM


I thought this community might be interested in a simulation market assessment that our lab put together at the end of 2013.  It is a study that aimed to quantify if and how local (Boise, Idaho) architecture and engineering firms use simulation, and what program's they utilize.  The research also serves as the baseline in benchmarking efforts to track the future adoption of building simulation over time for our area.  Our hope is that we can provide valuable research that will help a firm determine their competitiveness in the market and serve as motivation to consider integrating building simulation into their practice.

You can download the .pdf from our website here:   https://sites.google.com/site/idlbsug/market-assessment

Any comments from this group would be greatly appreciated.  Also, if you know of similar studies, sharing those sources would help us refine future market assessments.


Cheers and thanks!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] System 1 vs System 3 Fan Power Consumption - ASHRAE 90.1
	Appendix G
Message-ID: <6788a70369ddac873e3637aa41f12a09@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,



This question may have been discussed in length somewhere else but I was
not able to find it.



I am working on a mixed use dormitory. There is a restaurant, coffee shop
and university store/gift shop on the first few floors and private rooms
and suites on the upper floors. The building is DX cooling and gas heating.
Based on these conditions I have system 1 and system 3 for the baseline,
system one for the private rooms, system 3 for the other spaces.



Looking at section G3.1.2.9 in ASHRAE 90.1 there are two different
equations for fan power consumption. For systems 1 & 2, it's CFM * 0.3, for
systems 3-8, it's a slightly more complicated equation. However, after
performing the calculations I'm getting roughly CFM * 0.9. If I'm
interpreting this right it means that fan power consumption for systems 1 &
2 is 3 times less than that for systems 3-8.



It's not impossible that a split system, or system 1 type system, could be
installed in the other areas of the building, the mechanical contractor has
proposed as much for budgetary reasons. This would mean that the baseline
system could potentially use as much as 3 times as much energy as the
proposed system, and only because of the ASHRAE fan power consumption
equations.



Is there a reason why there is such a large difference between the two
equations? Or is my classification of the spaces and interpretation of the
equations off?



Thanks!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Database on 179D tax reduction?
Message-ID: <CAETHmJ4HDDpQw+wKpCA7mLQoWeJebdi6-b2Z8EeKK-HTSuVEYg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, all,

I'm wondering if there is some sort of database or archive documenting the
basic information or characteristics of each building that qualified for
partial or full 179d tax reduction.

Maybe I was just dreaming: what about general statics in terms of how many
buildings qualified as well as how many tax reductions dollars are issued?

Best,

Qinpeng

The IRS doesn't collect this data as part of the submissions, so I doubt that it would be available from the "program manager" perspective.

There are several consulting practices that focused extensively or exclusively on this service, you might see if any of them have provided publicly available presentations on the subject.

I'd be interested to hear from anyone that might be associated with DOE or one of the national laboratories if any study was performed where sample data was acquired from providers.

 CBECC-Com beta testing
Message-ID: <A74E88F4004970429432C6B5A251B224746C959E@uscas-002.us.wspgroup.com>

On behalf of the IBPSA-SF Chapter, we are pleased to announce the following event:

Webinar on CBECC-Com beta testing
When: Thursday, February 13, 2014 at 6:00pm - 8:00pm PST
Venue: WSP, 405 Howard Street, Suite 500, San Francisco, CA 94105

Schedule:                   6:00pm -6:30pm -     Networking (If attending in person)
6:30pm - 8pm -         Webinar Presentation

Architectural Energy Corporation (AEC) will be presenting a webinar providing an update on the current feature set of CBECC-Com (the CEC public domain Title 24 compliance software), targeted to the IBPSA San Francisco and Los Angeles Chapters.

The presenter will provide:

- An update on the current feature set of CBECC-Com.

- A webinar training session. The presenter will walk through the process of creating a simple building and its systems, spending an appropriate amount of time on each step and answering questions along the way.

- An overview of the CBECC-Com website (http://bees.archenergy.com/) where people can download the software, view short training video tutorials, and also log any issues they encounter while using CBECC-Com. The issue tracking feature will be an important part of the beta testing.


The webinar will also encourage IBPSA members interested in beta testing to identify any current projects they're working on that may be subject to complying with T24-2013 and use those as the basis for their beta testing. Alternately, any recently completed projects could serve as good test projects.

As testing progresses, IBPSA beta testers will be encouraged to submit any issues they encounter through the project issue tracker.

- AEC's team is contracted with the CEC to provide support to users of CBECC-Com during this beta testing period. We will be able to review problematic input files, error messages generated during a compliance analysis, and generally be available to answer questions.

- This support is not intended to be a substitute for a full-blown training course, so it is expected that beta testers will take time to review the available documentation and online videos.

WEBINAR REGISTRATION:

Please register at: https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/1598469261204813569
Webinar ID: 149-423-179

Seats limited to the first 100.

Unfortunately, there is no way for the IRS to collect any data on the 179D tax deductions, since it is not specifically called out in the tax filing documentation.  I have not seen any data or studies on the application for the 179D tax deduction.  As the author of the technical guide and the 179D DOE Calculator, I respond to a lot of questions about 179D and can provide some anecdotal insight.  Most of the applications for the tax deduction are for lighting under the interim lighting rule because it is easy to qualify for and does not require whole building simulations.  Over the last two years there has been an increase in filings for deductions for HVAC efficiency measures because the IRS lowered the savings level for HVAC and because the 179D DOE Calculator made it easy to calculate the savings.

I just wanted to follow up and share some of the available resources as I
could see there is so much interest on the topic from last night's
discussion.

Check out D3.js which is an open source JavaScript (not JAVA!) library for
data visualization: (http://d3js.org/). There are so many example that you
can find on the page with the source code. For instance, here is the
calender which is really similar to what we saw last night in the
presentation: (http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063318). Scroll down and you
can see the source code. You can also see the license.

Also check out NREL's IDEAKit project for the other interactive graph which
is also using d3 libraries (

To see the source code right click, view page source, or inspect elements.

If you want to get lost in the beauty of result visualization for the whole
Friday then here are my favorites:

Hey Mostapha, thanks for the IDEAKit shout-out! I should mention that NREL is using the d3 lib in the OpenStudio project proper, as well now. d3 is behind the high level results tab, and we also have exposed the reporting functions through the API so you can make your own custom reports, and visualizations powered by d3 and your own imagination:

Title: Data Mining: Get More Out of your Energy Models

Shreshth Nagpal, Associate, Atelier Ten


The presenters will talk about data discovery as a specific subset of data visualization. In particular about utilizing interactive graphics that provide a better way to query, filter and sort data; as analysis tools that find and express relationships between a multitude of design parameters.

About the Speaker:With over a decade of experience in the field of high-performance building design, Shreshth is an expert in the application of building performance simulation and analysis for architectural design and systems optimization.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Domestic Hot Water Profile for Indoor Soccer Facility
Message-ID: <DUB126-W152641C4DAAC98697D8387E0960@phx.gbl>

Hi all,



I'm looking for some guidance on how to model the domestic hot water 
load for an indoor soccer facility for LEED. The facility is scheduled 
to be open 18 hours per day, every day, with a potential changeover of 
120 people per hour (if each field has max occupancy and is rented out on an hourly basis). So, 120 people could potentially have a shower 
every hour, however, this is not realistic. I do not want to overestimate the energy savings and have 
the LEED reviewer find fault. Has anybody experience modelling a similar situation 
before?



Thanks

D?nal,
There are a lot of variables!

?         Men or women?  (shower length may vary :))

?         How many shower vs leave without showering?

?         Seasonal diversity? (warm months probably have  lower occupancy)

?         Daily diversity? (weekends may see greater use)

ASHRAE 90.1's User Manual does not address this type of occupancy, so I would interview the owner or facility manager and ask a lot of questions to assess these patterns.  If you have the best available data from your client, I doubt that LEED reviewers will quibble.  It will help the reviewers to explain the basis for your calculations.  I think they will appreciate a thoughtful and conscientious modeler.

My experience is to develop a diversity schedule that seems reasonable,
then so long as you keep it the same for the proposed and the baseline it
would be fine. If there is a MEP on the project you should have a peak flow
rate, the peak should be dictated by MEP assumptions, while your schedule
should coincide with MEP WeP1 calculations, that are based on the building
basis of design from the architect and owner assumptions.   The section 1.4
tables provided by USGBC have a section that I found useful in making
assumptions, and also for documentation, see attached example.. For the
attached I used the LEED projects use WeP1 calculations done by MEP for
flow rates based on occupant male vs female. The baseline water use from
the calculation had larger flow rates, also energy savings are achieved by
lower flow rates from the water efficient low flow hot water shower heads
and faucets in the proposed.

Hi sim friends,

I've recently released a new version of my free spatial thermal metrics
visualization plugin for Rhino5; you can now overlay thermal data with
customized climate-based daylight information (*.ill/*.pts, e.g. from
Daysim/DIVA) in such a way that they're easy to read simultaneously- maybe that
is of interest to some folks here. As is the case for thermal display, results
filtering by schedule, custom time range inputs etc. are also exposed for the
daylight component.

Full release log is here: http://mrcomfy.org/?p=605
.. and a first result from a little class testing the tool:
http://mrcomfy.org/?p=585

Enjoy,

Hi Donal,

Usual LEED 2009 projects base the shower uses on FTE/ visitor/ resident
numbers. If you are dealing with a facility that works differently, you'll
probably prefer to base your FTE/ visitor numbers on design assumptions or
information from the facility owner. It is a good idea to check out with
USGBC their opinion on your assumptions before submitting your project. You
can to that bty clicking on USGBC's page contact us link.

Good luck,

Hi all,

I'm trying to assess possible energy savings from improving different areas
of a chiller plant (cooling towers, adding free cooling, VFDs, controls).
Currently all the information I have is a snapshot of the chiller plant
performance at 2pm every day of the summer.

Is there a simple way to evaluate kWh saved? If modelling is the best
option which software is the best for this kind of analysis?

Thanks for any help,
Sebastian

Message-ID: <CAE4kNa6ptDORi+yYrt0Sfp+gMEiberTdTbFbi=V2c2Rbqg5kEQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a question regarding ASHRAE 90.1 baseline system 2 selection.
My proposed building is a high-rise apartment in Denver, and the building
is using electric resistance for space heating.
According to ASHRAE 90.1 requirement, the baseline system would be system 2
PTHP with electrical backup.
As expected, the electric consumed by heat pump is only half of the
electric consumed by the electric resistance, giving me a hard time
achieving the LEED EA prerequisite.
So my question is :
1. Since air source heat pump is not common used in Denver because of the
cold climate, do we still need to use AAHP as our baseline, is there any
exceptional calculation in ASHRAE 90.1?

Thanks in advance,

Te

Dear Sebastian,

I start with kW/ton ratings at AHRI conditions from the manufacturer.  
Those are good inputs into the software.  I use Energy Pro, but I 
believe most software can take that as input.

It is theoretically possible to estimate performance with evaporative 
pre-coolers if you have reliable effectiveness and chiller data.

Most programs will allow VFD or multi-speed pumps as well.

standard/general daily cooling profiles that I could use?

Depending on hourly occupancy of the facility I'd start with outside air temperature at the logged hours.

Hi all,

I'm trying to assess possible energy savings from improving different areas of a chiller plant (cooling towers, adding free cooling, VFDs, controls). Currently all the information I have is a snapshot of the chiller plant performance at 2pm every day of the summer.

Is there a simple way to evaluate kWh saved? If modelling is the best option which software is the best for this kind of analysis?

Thanks for any help,
Sebastian

Dear Sebastian,

I start with kW/ton ratings at AHRI conditions from the manufacturer.  
Those are good inputs into the software.  I use Energy Pro, but I 
believe most software can take that as input.

It is theoretically possible to estimate performance with evaporative 
pre-coolers if you have reliable effectiveness and chiller data.

Most programs will allow VFD or multi-speed pumps as well.

For that you need to model the building with local weather data, Sebastian.

And here is some good 2012 data from Seattle- Climate Zone 4C (gathered thanks to code-required energy use reporting).

It's nice to start getting some new data to supplement our knowledge from the pretty-dated CBECS reports.

Message-ID: <CAOQXAFC6zGfkf3NgWxgsb1214Qa4-X9NFRxPwu4iTQ+1u1sOGg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear bldg sim'rs

I'm a little concerned that the plug loads I've modelled in my offices are
low and could leed to some unwanted usgbc comments.

I'm meeting the 25% requirement but the peak load in the offices is 10w/m2.
Whilst i dont think this is overly optimistic the reviewers may think
otherwise. Has anybody had experience of plug loads being queried in detail?

Many thanks

Chris

Chris,

The plug loads are the plug loads. The 25% is just a guidance value from USGBC/GBCI. I've been over and under this level numerous times without a problem.

If you've used the load estimated by the mechanical and/or electrical engineers and apply an appropriate schedule then it should be good enough.

When you're under the 25% threshold a text box will appear for you to explain why. Just state that you've modeled the plug loads as designed.

10 W/m2 sounds a little low for an office. If the owner has made a commitment to use Energy Star devices or laptops for everyone, then 10 W/m2 is plausible. Don't forget to include other equipment like servers/IT equipment, copiers and kitchen equipment (microwave, coffee maker, etc.)

Dear bldg sim'rs

I'm a little concerned that the plug loads I've modelled in my offices are low and could leed to some unwanted usgbc comments.

I'm meeting the 25% requirement but the peak load in the offices is 10w/m2. Whilst i dont think this is overly optimistic the reviewers may think otherwise. Has anybody had experience of plug loads being queried in detail?

Many thanks

Chris

At lower than 25% levels GBCI likely will ask for an itemized list to show that you've considered all of the potential contributors. In addition to Fred's list, add elevators if these aren't separately modeled. Water coolers. Anything that shows up with a connection in the electrical plans.

Chris,

 

My experience has been that if you can provide defensible justification for
your assumptions on plug loads, and state what those assumptions are up
front and why, that reviewers will accept it, even when the "process" loads
in the building don't quite add up to 25%.

 

I've used both the 90.1 User's Manual tables G-B and G-E through G-O and the
COMNET appendices B & C as a basis for receptacle loads and schedules.

 

Thanks,

Steven

This matches my experience as well for plug loads.

I would only plan to itemize plug loads for LEED documentation if attempting to document an energy saving measure above and beyond 90.1 pertaining to receptacle loads (such as plug load circuit controls required by the upcoming title 24).

ASHRAE recommends 0.75 W/ft2 for office building receptacle power density in the user's manual for 90.1-2007 (for when you don't have better data to found the inputs on).  10W/m2 is approximately 0.93W/ft2 (if my math is right), so that's certainly within a reasonable range of expectations.

I do not anticipate you will have any issues.  I've regularly documented exactly the value per the user's manual citing that as the source in my documentation with no further comment.

Brilliant response! Thanks.

If there's a load defined in the design brief then this is typically an 
undiversified design load. I guess an appropriate diversity factor 
should be modelled in this case.

Are the COMNET appendices B&C freely available? I started out with 
COMNET (or at least our software vendor's interpretation of it), but it 
seemed to have quite high plug loads and low occupancy gain.

Cheers

Chris

Hi,

In Canada's norms, there are this table as reference for the plug loads.

Objet : Re: [Bldg-sim] Leed eac1 Plug loads

This matches my experience as well for plug loads.

I would only plan to itemize plug loads for LEED documentation if attempting to document an energy saving measure above and beyond 90.1 pertaining to receptacle loads (such as plug load circuit controls required by the upcoming title 24).

ASHRAE recommends 0.75 W/ft2 for office building receptacle power density in the user's manual for 90.1-2007 (for when you don't have better data to found the inputs on).  10W/m2 is approximately 0.93W/ft2 (if my math is right), so that's certainly within a reasonable range of expectations.

I do not anticipate you will have any issues.  I've regularly documented exactly the value per the user's manual citing that as the source in my documentation with no further comment.

At lower than 25% levels GBCI likely will ask for an itemized list to show that you've considered all of the potential contributors. In addition to Fred's list, add elevators if these aren't separately modeled. Water coolers. Anything that shows up with a connection in the electrical plans.

Chris,

The plug loads are the plug loads. The 25% is just a guidance value from USGBC/GBCI. I've been over and under this level numerous times without a problem.

If you've used the load estimated by the mechanical and/or electrical engineers and apply an appropriate schedule then it should be good enough.

When you're under the 25% threshold a text box will appear for you to explain why. Just state that you've modeled the plug loads as designed.

10 W/m2 sounds a little low for an office. If the owner has made a commitment to use Energy Star devices or laptops for everyone, then 10 W/m2 is plausible. Don't forget to include other equipment like servers/IT equipment, copiers and kitchen equipment (microwave, coffee maker, etc.)

Dear bldg sim'rs

I'm a little concerned that the plug loads I've modelled in my offices are low and could leed to some unwanted usgbc comments.

I'm meeting the 25% requirement but the peak load in the offices is 10w/m2. Whilst i dont think this is overly optimistic the reviewers may think otherwise. Has anybody had experience of plug loads being queried in detail?

Many thanks

Chris

	ETH Zurich, Switzerland
Message-ID: <CAG7SY4vwQfNjwtcnsLu=qFmyqFDvQsKyWnwDSYJTxdwvUKw2dg@mail.gmail.com>

The Assistant Professorship of Architecture & Sustainable Building
Technologies (SuAT) at ETH Zurich, Switzerland has three immediate openings
for:

Research Assistant / PhD Candidate

in the areas of:

1. Design, Modeling and Integration of Advanced Building Systems
Your task will consist in the design, modelling, simulation and performance
assessment of advanced thermal and mechanical building systems. This
includes component sizing, supervision of the installation, and the
post-installation performance evaluation. Also part of your work will be
the project management related to design integration into the actual
building project.

2. Mechanical/Electrical System Design of Dynamic Fa?ades
Your task will consist in researching, designing and prototyping of an
innovative fa?ade system that successfully integrates individual shading
modules into the architecture of the buildings. This will consists of a
lightweight mechanical structure including routing for the electrical
cables and pneumatic components.

3. Modeling and Control of Soft Robotic Actuators for Architectural
Applications
Your tasks will consist in the development and successful implementation of
pneumatic actuator control. This include hardware and software for both
low-level motor control for the individual module, as well as high-level
task control for the entire array comprised multiple modules. You will
compare open vs. closed-loop control strategies and develop classic, model
predictive and advanced controllers. The control strategies will be
evaluated in a long-term real-world scenario including user interaction.

The research of SuAT focuses on new approaches for the design, planning and
operation of buildings as integrated, dynamic systems. The motivation and
aim of our research is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in buildings and
increase the efficiency of energy and resource use of the built
environment. The research is based on the identification and integration of
advanced technologies, methods and processes from the fields of building
systems, information and communication technologies.

The proposed positions are part of an international flagship project to
showcase advances in sustainable building technologies. Please visit our
website (http://suat.arch.ethz.ch/en/open-positions) for more details on
the job descriptions, or apply online at www.jobs.ethz.ch.<
http://www.jobs.ethz.ch.> Please indicate your potential starting date.

Please contact Dr. Zoltan Nagy (nagyz at ethz.ch) with any questions!

Message-ID: <CAF32zMSuQbPkmT1q=zoALjXp2Pt9UMApzgnk7nrPx5jvp4dDiQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Group,

I am wondering if there is a "overcooling" benchmark such as CIBSE
overheating benchmark (1% of occupied period over 28C operative
temperature). I am evaluating a naturally ventilated building and I need a
benchmark to figure out if the building needs a heating system in a pretty
moderated climate.

Many Thanks,

This matches my experience as well for plug loads.

I would only plan to itemize plug loads for LEED documentation if attempting to document an energy saving measure above and beyond 90.1 pertaining to receptacle loads (such as plug load circuit controls required by the upcoming title 24).

ASHRAE recommends 0.75 W/ft2 for office building receptacle power density in the user's manual for 90.1-2007 (for when you don't have better data to found the inputs on).  10W/m2 is approximately 0.93W/ft2 (if my math is right), so that's certainly within a reasonable range of expectations.

I do not anticipate you will have any issues.  I've regularly documented exactly the value per the user's manual citing that as the source in my documentation with no further comment.

At lower than 25% levels GBCI likely will ask for an itemized list to show that you've considered all of the potential contributors. In addition to Fred's list, add elevators if these aren't separately modeled. Water coolers. Anything that shows up with a connection in the electrical plans.

Chris,

The plug loads are the plug loads. The 25% is just a guidance value from USGBC/GBCI. I've been over and under this level numerous times without a problem.

If you've used the load estimated by the mechanical and/or electrical engineers and apply an appropriate schedule then it should be good enough.

When you're under the 25% threshold a text box will appear for you to explain why. Just state that you've modeled the plug loads as designed.

10 W/m2 sounds a little low for an office. If the owner has made a commitment to use Energy Star devices or laptops for everyone, then 10 W/m2 is plausible. Don't forget to include other equipment like servers/IT equipment, copiers and kitchen equipment (microwave, coffee maker, etc.)

Dear bldg sim'rs

I'm a little concerned that the plug loads I've modelled in my offices are low and could leed to some unwanted usgbc comments.

I'm meeting the 25% requirement but the peak load in the offices is 10w/m2. Whilst i dont think this is overly optimistic the reviewers may think otherwise. Has anybody had experience of plug loads being queried in detail?

Many thanks

Chris

Hi Felipe,

Heating tends to be much more critical than cooling. I recommend first
checking local codes (building codes and associated such as housing or
specific for housing depending on where you are and your type of building)
and make sure you reach the threshold they might set on design day. If
there is nothing, you could start with 17?C at night (if its housing) or
19?C during the day or if it's an office building. Anything below that will
start to be uncomfortable. If it's a residential building you could
eventually tolerate a margin for 1% of the time but I suggest making sure
you don't get much lower than 17?C (I'd say 16?C tops at night) otherwise
it'll really be very uncomfortable.

Best,

Hello,

ASHRAE Std. 55 has a chart that you can use for naturally ?conditioned spaces. ? You can determine an acceptable operative temperature based on the mean monthly outdoor temperature. I'm not aware of an acceptable exceedance though.

The ASHRAE standard appears to be written for buildings which eliminate cooling systems but I think the lower line could be used when you are trying to eliminate a heating system?

Felipe is quoting a Cibse overheating criterion for summertime comfort -
not a heating scenario but a cooling one.

Regarding the table/ graph in Ashrae 55. I found it much harder to comply
with than the cibse guidance. I understand that the cibse guidance is
structured to encourage the take up of natural ventilation.

Cibse Method: A full weather year of simulation is done and excessive
temperatures are binned out of the results. Appropriate weather data (hot)
needs to be used for it to be meaningful.

Network airflow is required in the simulation tool.

I think Felipe is looking for comparable criteria.

Message-ID: <CAMrpff-Yf1gwKAVuZmy8dZ3hAcJiJyb=TGwCfH7Czyx-zURkTw@mail.gmail.com>

I would like to raise a question within the same thread context. I am using
eQuest and modeling the process energy for a 25-story hotel as 25% of
baseline energy cost as per LEED default. The process energy includes (All
plug loads/Receptacles, computers, kitchen equipment, laundry, data center,
elevators, etc). I assumed that 25% default value is less than the actual
process energy.

In order to include all above process energy heat dissipation within HVAC
systems simulation for both proposed and baseline models without let eQuest
account for direct energy consumption, I have modeled the heat dissipation
(assumed equal input power value) in eQuest at Space, Equipment Tab,
Internal Energy Sources field, instead of Equipment field.

Is my modeling process at this area correct? Any help, advice, correction
will be highly appreciated.

Thanks Matt for your input, The Revised Section 1.4 spreadsheet input
sheets must be used for projects registered after September 30, 2013, but
can be used by projects with any registered date. My project has been
registered before Sep. 30,2013 and it becomes optional to either comply or
not. From energy saving point of view, using 25% default value for process
load energy will result in more energy saving over the baseline case than
modeling actual process load energy.

The kitchen consultant provides a detail equipment power input and heat
dissipation.

If anyone has better approach or experienced such way, I would like to
hear.

General Query:

There is NO 25% default/threshold/minimum for process loads.

Older versions of LEED literature led us to believe there was an expectation/requirement for process loads to be 25%, or else some extra tier of documentation/justification would kick in and be required ? I believe there was a specific reference to a detailed breakdown in some fashion.  That has since been debunked and the 25% figure is nearly meaningless in the context of LEED energy modeling, except as (very) loose guidance for what might be expected of a ?typical? multistory office building.  In reality, annual process load percentages can vary quite a bit on a case-by-case basis for occupied buildings.

What?s I understand is required of process loads (regardless of annual percentage) is to document the associated inputs, and give the reviewer a brief and clear understanding of where those are sourced from.

For typical projects, I may only provide a few lines in the EAp2 spreadsheet, such as:

-          0.75 W/SF for plug loads, per ASHRAE 90.1 User?s Manual guidance, hourly fractional schedule to represent seasonal usage as per building owner input

-          (2) 9.2kW elevator traction motors, modeled with fractional scheduling per ASHRAE 90.1 User?s manual guidance to represent typical usage for ?Office? buildings

-          5 kW garage ventilation fan load, with scheduling to represent full ON operation during all occupied hours.

I would leave it to the reviewer to determine if anything requires further explanation or detail, and would supply full information for any or all of the above items upon request through the preliminary review process.

For projects with kitchens, laboratories, industrial processes, or similar special cases with complex or substantial process loads, I would provide a more detailed report of those loads for preliminary review ? perhaps by way of attachment or separate upload, if that?s easier.



Equest Query:

Relative to Equipment inputs, Internal energy source inputs allow for greater flexibility in fuel source types: electricity, gas, hot water, and ?process? which represents loads that aren?t associated with your utility meters (e.g. gas-powered forklifts).  Downside is you have to convert electrical loads to Btu/h.

It?s your preference to choose how to utilize either or both space input types ? whatever is convenient to you.  I personally always use the Equipment input for plug loads and other electric-sourced space loads, using Internal energy source inputs only as needed.

For either case, if you wish to remove all or some fraction of the associated heat load, you can edit the ?sensible heat gain ratio? input down zero (default is 1.00).  Also take note there?s a corresponding option for a fraction of the input load to be encountered in the space as a latent heat load (of particular interest for kitchens).

Download the latest version of the LEED table 1.4 spreadsheet and see the comment in the Equipment sheet. Basically, you should not arbitrarily set the load to 25%.

 Also, kitchen equipment should probably have a greater detail on heat generation -- see Ashrae handbooks.

I would like to raise a question within the same thread context. I am using eQuest and modeling the process energy for a 25-story hotel as 25% of baseline energy cost as per LEED default. The process energy includes (All plug loads/Receptacles, computers, kitchen equipment, laundry, data center, elevators, etc). I assumed that 25% default value is less than the actual process energy.

In order to include all above process energy heat dissipation within HVAC systems simulation for both proposed and baseline models without let eQuest account for direct energy consumption, I have modeled the heat dissipation (assumed equal input power value) in eQuest at Space, Equipment Tab, Internal Energy Sources field, instead of Equipment field.

Is my modeling process at this area correct? Any help, advice, correction will be highly appreciated.

This matches my experience as well for plug loads.

I would only plan to itemize plug loads for LEED documentation if attempting to document an energy saving measure above and beyond 90.1 pertaining to receptacle loads (such as plug load circuit controls required by the upcoming title 24).

ASHRAE recommends 0.75 W/ft2 for office building receptacle power density in the user?s manual for 90.1-2007 (for when you don?t have better data to found the inputs on).  10W/m2 is approximately 0.93W/ft2 (if my math is right), so that?s certainly within a reasonable range of expectations.

I do not anticipate you will have any issues.  I?ve regularly documented exactly the value per the user?s manual citing that as the source in my documentation with no further comment.

I?ve never had to provide an itemized list for equipment loads after simply telling them the receptacle loads were modeled as designed per space type.

At lower than 25% levels GBCI likely will ask for an itemized list to show that you?ve considered all of the potential contributors. In addition to Fred?s list, add elevators if these aren?t separately modeled. Water coolers. Anything that shows up with a connection in the electrical plans.

Chris,

The plug loads are the plug loads. The 25% is just a guidance value from USGBC/GBCI. I?ve been over and under this level numerous times without a problem.

If you?ve used the load estimated by the mechanical and/or electrical engineers and apply an appropriate schedule then it should be good enough.

When you?re under the 25% threshold a text box will appear for you to explain why. Just state that you?ve modeled the plug loads as designed.

10 W/m2 sounds a little low for an office. If the owner has made a commitment to use Energy Star devices or laptops for everyone, then 10 W/m2 is plausible. Don?t forget to include other equipment like servers/IT equipment, copiers and kitchen equipment (microwave, coffee maker, etc.)

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Leed eac1 Plug loads


Dear bldg sim'rs

I'm a little concerned that the plug loads I've modelled in my offices are low and could leed to some unwanted usgbc comments.

I'm meeting the 25% requirement but the peak load in the offices is 10w/m2. Whilst i dont think this is overly optimistic the reviewers may think otherwise. Has anybody had experience of plug loads being queried in detail?

Many thanks

Chris

Timur,
I find the DOE Commercial Reference Buildings very useful for examining generic building types.
http://energy.gov/eere/buildings/commercial-reference-buildings

You can also find the models that PNNL researched for various iterations of ASHRAE 90.1 which gives info on newer buildings.
http://www.energycodes.gov/development/commercial/90.1_models

You may have to dig into the data a little bit, but you should be able to find typical space use breakdowns for these building types.  I'm not sure if that's what you're after but they might be helpful.

Hello all,

I am modelling an industrial building according to European climate.  My
problem is they dont have any data  which i can use for my modelling. So i
need to use the standard data to model. If any one has done before please
help  me.

What could be the appropriate values for lighting , equipment's , Load ,
HVAC and leakage shall be
 used.

Looking forward for help.

Thanks in Advance

You could try the UK NCM databases:
http://www.ncm.bre.co.uk/filelibrary/NCM_databases_v4.1.e.zip

Or, lighting table 9.6.1 in ASHRAE 90.1 and Table G-N in the 90.1 user
manual.

For infiltration, CIBSE guide A section 4 provides guidance including some
look up tables with recommended air change rates - if you already know the
envelope permeability.

Hope this helps.

Chris

Can someone with the knowledge and experience necessary to build a 
smartphone application allowing a person to walk through an existing 
building and create a 3D model with Google's new Project Tango phone go to 
this website, http://www.google.com/atap/projecttango/, and request a 
prototype dev kit?

If you haven't watched the video yet, you should check it out (
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe10ExwzCqk). This would be a great tool 
for creating existing building 3D geometry models. Maybe it could even be 
accurate enough to recognize light fixtures in the ceiling/on the wall and 
the app could ask you to input the fixture wattage while you are in the 
building.

I'm hopeful that this technology will be able to help the AEC industry. 
What do you think?

I just had another idea. What if the app could let you walk through a new 
building in the process of being constructed and it would automatically 
detect studs, ducts, etc. that are located in a different location from 
that of the BIM model (I understand that the building isn't constructed to 
perfectly reflect the BIM model, but it might be helpful in the 
commissioning process or for construction management).

It could also help contractors and sub-contractors visualize the BIM model 
in the field, instead of having to worry about translating the 3D BIM 
model to 2D drawings or carrying around a mobile device with the 3D BIM 
model and trying to navigate it based on where you are standing on the 
site/within the building.

Note that I don't have any actual construction experience, but these are 
ideas I came up with based on what I hear about the construction 
industry/process.

If detecting existing building elements could be as easy as a walkthrough, it would definitely be an amazing feat.  Currently working on projects that have had laser scans of spaces, but the files are HUGE and require someone to manually trace over to create an existing building model. Also, from my understanding, these lasers can't always capture anything overlapping (i.e. stacked ducts) if anything is hidden.  I'm curious how large the models are and how it could best translated to 3D modeling programs like Revit.

Can someone with the knowledge and experience necessary to build a smartphone application allowing a person to walk through an existing building and create a 3D model with Google's new Project Tango phone go to this website, http://www.google.com/atap/projecttango/, and request a prototype dev kit?

If you haven't watched the video yet, you should check it out (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe10ExwzCqk). This would be a great tool for creating existing building 3D geometry models. Maybe it could even be accurate enough to recognize light fixtures in the ceiling/on the wall and the app could ask you to input the fixture wattage while you are in the building.

I'm hopeful that this technology will be able to help the AEC industry. What do you think?

Those are good points. In terms of the file size and translation to Revit, 
I imagine that there would need to be a way of converting the data into an 
useful 3D model. However, if you watch the youtube video that I posted, 
they showed example augmented reality games that took the geometry data 
from the room provided by the phone and converted into a virtual 3D model 
of the room that had a game world overlaid on top of it. So it seems like 
a similar approach could be used to simplify the data and translate it 
into something that software like Revit could use.

If detecting existing building elements could be as easy as a walkthrough, 
it would definitely be an amazing feat.  Currently working on projects 
that have had laser scans of spaces, but the files are HUGE and require 
someone to manually trace over to create an existing building model. Also, 
from my understanding, these lasers can?t always capture anything 
overlapping (i.e. stacked ducts) if anything is hidden.  I?m curious how 
large the models are and how it could best translated to 3D modeling 
programs like Revit.

I just had another idea. What if the app could let you walk through a new 
building in the process of being constructed and it would automatically 
detect studs, ducts, etc. that are located in a different location from 
that of the BIM model (I understand that the building isn't constructed to 
perfectly reflect the BIM model, but it might be helpful in the 
commissioning process or for construction management). 

It could also help contractors and sub-contractors visualize the BIM model 
in the field, instead of having to worry about translating the 3D BIM 
model to 2D drawings or carrying around a mobile device with the 3D BIM 
model and trying to navigate it based on where you are standing on the 
site/within the building. 

Note that I don't have any actual construction experience, but these are 
ideas I came up with based on what I hear about the construction 
industry/process.

Sorry for some many posts about this, but I just find out that there is a 
company that appears to already be working on a similar solution. 
Matterport (http://matterport.com/industries/#commercial-construction) is 
one of the early testers of Project Tango (http://tcrn.ch/1fhBR1F) and 
they told TechCrunch that it's capabilities are similar to their own 
camera system. It appears that Matterport is able to convert the data into 
an .obj file format which can be opened by the following software 
programs: Autodesk Maya, Autodesk 3dsMax, MeshLab, Blender, Cinema 4d, 
Zbrush, and Unity.

Dear jason,

I presented a paper about this issue in the BSO 2012 in Loughborough - from a more user friendly perspective.
Reference is:

Bleil De Souza,?C. and Alsaadani,?S. 2012. Thermal zoning in speculative office buildings: Discussing the connections between space layout and inside temperature control. Presented at: Building Simulation and Optimization 2012,?Loughborough, UK,?10-11 September 2012

I hope it helps you

Regards

Clarice

	Analysis

BLDG-SIMMERS -


My apologies for the late notice, but our lab is broadcasting our monthly BSUG presentation (4th wed of the month, typically) on the various Revit export options to 3rd party daylight simulation programs.  See below for details:


Date: Feb 26, 12.00-13.00 (MT)


Register:  https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/3390430222254243841?

Description: As Revit evolves and gains more embedded analytical capabilities, its ability to perform daylight analysis is also rapidly evolving.  Currently two main workflows exist.  The traditional workflow exports geometry and material characteristics from Revit into 3rd party daylight simulation software.  Autodesk is rapidly developing a second pathway that allows analysis directly within Revit via a plugin.  This month's BSUG will focus on the export workflow, while March's BSUG will speak towards embedded daylight analysis capabilities within Revit.

Autodesk has made great strides to streamline the export process for Revit to 3rd party daylight analysis programs.  Currently, Revit models can be exported as a GBXML file, a .dxf, or a .dwg.  This presentation will cover the strengths and weaknesses of each pathway, while also featuring a demo of each export procedure.


For more information, visit the BSUG website at https://sites.google.com/site/idlbsug/upcoming-events/feb26bsug20-daylightanalysisthroughrevit-thesagacontinues


Please let me know if you have any questions, hope you can join us!

That assumes of course that the BIM model is correct or that items are modeled as we want them too. :) this is in many cases not the fact and when stuff gets installed in the field many architects have an Oh shit moment when the realize what they drew really doesn't work or look good.

Sorry for some many posts about this, but I just find out that there is a company that appears to already be working on a similar solution. Matterport (http://matterport.com/industries/#commercial-construction) is one of the early testers of Project Tango (http://tcrn.ch/1fhBR1F) and they told TechCrunch that it's capabilities are similar to their own camera system. It appears that Matterport is able to convert the data into an .obj file format which can be opened by the following software programs: Autodesk Maya, Autodesk 3dsMax, MeshLab, Blender, Cinema 4d, Zbrush, and Unity.

If detecting existing building elements could be as easy as a walkthrough, it would definitely be an amazing feat.  Currently working on projects that have had laser scans of spaces, but the files are HUGE and require someone to manually trace over to create an existing building model. Also, from my understanding, these lasers can't always capture anything overlapping (i.e. stacked ducts) if anything is hidden.  I'm curious how large the models are and how it could best translated to 3D modeling programs like Revit.

I just had another idea. What if the app could let you walk through a new building in the process of being constructed and it would automatically detect studs, ducts, etc. that are located in a different location from that of the BIM model (I understand that the building isn't constructed to perfectly reflect the BIM model, but it might be helpful in the commissioning process or for construction management).

It could also help contractors and sub-contractors visualize the BIM model in the field, instead of having to worry about translating the 3D BIM model to 2D drawings or carrying around a mobile device with the 3D BIM model and trying to navigate it based on where you are standing on the site/within the building.

Note that I don't have any actual construction experience, but these are ideas I came up with based on what I hear about the construction industry/process.

Can someone with the knowledge and experience necessary to build a smartphone application allowing a person to walk through an existing building and create a 3D model with Google's new Project Tango phone go to this website, http://www.google.com/atap/projecttango/, and request a prototype dev kit?

If you haven't watched the video yet, you should check it out (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe10ExwzCqk). This would be a great tool for creating existing building 3D geometry models. Maybe it could even be accurate enough to recognize light fixtures in the ceiling/on the wall and the app could ask you to input the fixture wattage while you are in the building.

I'm hopeful that this technology will be able to help the AEC industry. What do you think?

Message-ID: <AF7766FF9623CB419803ECF0D4FF04F207284A98@UUSNWE1N.na.utcmail.com>

All,
Does anyone know, particularly through having claims accepted by GBCI, whether the ASHRAE App G VAV fan curve is supposed to represent a fan system with or without static pressure reset. I always thought it was supposed to represent a system with sp reset, conforming to 6.5.3.2.3. However, most of the curve power values are even higher than curves representing VAV/VFD systems without sp reset. A confusing aspect is that compared to other VFD fan curves, the power values are high at high flows, but low at low flows, even going to zero at zero flow, though that is really meaningless.

As an aside, the 2013 Title 24 ACM now defines fan curves for central VAV systems with and without sp reset, taken from Taylor's VAV design guide. SP reset is the "baseline" or "standard."A

Thanks for any experience or thoughts on this.

I think it is pretty clear the way 90.1 App. G is written that you SHALL use that specific curve for the baseline VAV system fan power. Now it is a different discussion about whether that curve properly accounts for any ASHRAE required controls strategies, fan performance requirements, etc, but that doesn't really matter, here is the curve to use.

Proposed, as always, should accurately reflect how the system will operate. If you think a more advantageous fan curve is appropriate, such as to account for static pressure reset, go ahead and use it, just as you could create a custom curve for boiler or chiller part-load efficiencies. Don't hide the fact, make it clear to the reviewer that you are using different curves, state the source for your proposed curve and see if they want to comment or challenge the results.

For what it is worth (keeping in mind that past rulings do not set precedent), on multiple projects I have worked on I have used "static pressure reset" fan curves in the proposed, the mandatory baseline fan curve in the baseline, and it has never even been questioned by the reviewer.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] ASHRAE App G VAV Fan Curve

All,
Does anyone know, particularly through having claims accepted by GBCI, whether the ASHRAE App G VAV fan curve is supposed to represent a fan system with or without static pressure reset. I always thought it was supposed to represent a system with sp reset, conforming to 6.5.3.2.3. However, most of the curve power values are even higher than curves representing VAV/VFD systems without sp reset. A confusing aspect is that compared to other VFD fan curves, the power values are high at high flows, but low at low flows, even going to zero at zero flow, though that is really meaningless.

As an aside, the 2013 Title 24 ACM now defines fan curves for central VAV systems with and without sp reset, taken from Taylor's VAV design guide. SP reset is the "baseline" or "standard."A

Thanks for any experience or thoughts on this.

Section 6.5.3.2.3 requires static pressure reset for VAV fan system with DDC of individual zones and I believe that requirement predates the fan curve in Appendix G.  Given the prevalence of DDC zones, it seems disingenuous to claim savings for static pressure reset under Appendix G.  Maybe there is room for claiming improved reset based on oversized ducts and boxes?  It wouldn't take much to run the different published VFD curves out there and use whichever one gives your project the most savings but that is clearly gaming the system.  Since tools are not explicitly modeling the physics of static pressure reset, I suggest it should at least be isolated as an exceptional calculation for review.

Thank you Nathan,
I think a reasonable sp reset fan curve is better than the ASHRAE baseline curve at most values of interest.

I did just notice that the ASHRAE curve appears to have been "forced" through 30% power at 50% flow which is the minimum performance listed in 6.5.3.2.1. For some reason, it was also "forced" through zero power at zero flow.

I got 4 mails from them in 2013, all sent via vresp.com. I'm pretty sure
I've never visited energymodels.com website and have no idea who they
are.

The mails don't say where my email was harvested from.

Cheers for that. Give 'em a hard time. Too many companies now think that
any contact gives them a licence to spam you forevermore. And of course
some don't even wait for that initial contact. That didn't used to
happen in the world of real shops. Multiply this by the hundreds of
outfits we deal with every year and the result is a massive PITA.

Message-ID: <CAMrpff8Znc2UhB9KHHo=gT3M-4EJ-KtqzWei3OgoMpVHzwzA_Q@mail.gmail.com>

* Sorry for the cross posting!

Dear eQuester,

I am modeling a Main hotel kitchen in eQuest, the kitchen is conditioned
with a dedicated AHU including a percentage of outdoor air (input at
outdoor air zone level) within the AHU.

The kitchen equipment hoods are being served with exhaust, ecology, and
make-up fans are working *on-demand bases as variable speed fans*. I have
modeled the kitchen hoods exhaust/make-up fans as following:

- Divided the sum of all exhaust/make-up fans power to the exhaust
airflow *only
*to get (kW/CFM) and input the exhaust airflow and kW/CFM at kitchen zone
level.
- I set the Tracking Ctrl to "*No Airflow Tracking*"
- I set the Exhaust Fan Ctrl to "*Fan-EIR-FPLR*"
- I set the Exhaust Source to "*Balanced Infiltration*", will
be independently controlled and balanced out of AHU.
- I set the Fan Flow Schedule to operate 24-hrs as it ON/OFF schedule!.

I want to know how eQuest will control the fan speed (variably) and fan
power accordingly, is "Fan-EIR-FPLR" control and
its corresponding "Variable Speed Drive FPLR" curve will translate the fan
power according to the "Fan Flow Schedule" operation?

Is there edit shall I do in the Fan flow schedule? It can be a fraction
schedule interlocking to the occupancy schedule?

I would appreciate any suggestion on the above modeling input in such
Variable Kitchen Exhaust case.

If you like pondering these things, consider supply air temperature reset in 90.1 / Appendix G for humid climates.  Then put them together.
I  am starting to see why Wetter et al are interested in virtual controls playgrounds.

Subject: [External] RE: ASHRAE App G VAV Fan Curve

Section 6.5.3.2.3 requires static pressure reset for VAV fan system with DDC of individual zones and I believe that requirement predates the fan curve in Appendix G.  Given the prevalence of DDC zones, it seems disingenuous to claim savings for static pressure reset under Appendix G.  Maybe there is room for claiming improved reset based on oversized ducts and boxes?  It wouldn't take much to run the different published VFD curves out there and use whichever one gives your project the most savings but that is clearly gaming the system.  Since tools are not explicitly modeling the physics of static pressure reset, I suggest it should at least be isolated as an exceptional calculation for review.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] ASHRAE App G VAV Fan Curve

I think it is pretty clear the way 90.1 App. G is written that you SHALL use that specific curve for the baseline VAV system fan power. Now it is a different discussion about whether that curve properly accounts for any ASHRAE required controls strategies, fan performance requirements, etc, but that doesn't really matter, here is the curve to use.

Proposed, as always, should accurately reflect how the system will operate. If you think a more advantageous fan curve is appropriate, such as to account for static pressure reset, go ahead and use it, just as you could create a custom curve for boiler or chiller part-load efficiencies. Don't hide the fact, make it clear to the reviewer that you are using different curves, state the source for your proposed curve and see if they want to comment or challenge the results.

For what it is worth (keeping in mind that past rulings do not set precedent), on multiple projects I have worked on I have used "static pressure reset" fan curves in the proposed, the mandatory baseline fan curve in the baseline, and it has never even been questioned by the reviewer.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] ASHRAE App G VAV Fan Curve

All,
Does anyone know, particularly through having claims accepted by GBCI, whether the ASHRAE App G VAV fan curve is supposed to represent a fan system with or without static pressure reset. I always thought it was supposed to represent a system with sp reset, conforming to 6.5.3.2.3. However, most of the curve power values are even higher than curves representing VAV/VFD systems without sp reset. A confusing aspect is that compared to other VFD fan curves, the power values are high at high flows, but low at low flows, even going to zero at zero flow, though that is really meaningless.

As an aside, the 2013 Title 24 ACM now defines fan curves for central VAV systems with and without sp reset, taken from Taylor's VAV design guide. SP reset is the "baseline" or "standard."A

Thanks for any experience or thoughts on this.

All,
This is a great example in contrasting styles of applying Appendix G for energy rating and I'm torn between the two as my message indicated. Both provide reasonable justification for their conclusions. Thanks Paul and Nathan. This is the kind of thing USGBC/GBCI should be addressing in the LEED Energy Modeling Guide and eventually ASHRAE. It's also an example of why California is going to the CBECC-Com process for determining compliance with energy models.

Fred,

The reason for "forcing" zero power at zero mass flow rate is because the
temperature raise across the fan is dT = P/m_flow/cp, where P is the power
of the fan, m_flow is the mass flow rate and cp is the specific heat
capacity. If P were not zero at m_flow=0, one would get an infinite large
temperature raise. Forcing P=0 if m_flow=0 is for numerical reasons, which
is important as continuous time simulators cross the region of very small
flow rates when equipment is switched on or off. However, proper
implementation of controls will not simulate the fan at such low speed for
extended periods of time, as this region is outside of the capability of
the real equipment. Therefore, this treatment does not affect your energy
saving calculations.

For a more in-depth discussion about this topic, see Section 4 in
http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/19401493.2013.765506

All the best,

Michael

Hi Fred,

I dove into this topic some time back specifically trying to understand the Appendix G curve in relation to reset strategies and the DOE2/eQuest default library curves.

Attached discussion (and attached discussions therein) recounts a lively discussion and some helpful visuals I produced to establish my observations, concluding the App. G curve is ultimately... not clear on the matter (and thus inappropriate for direct use in evaluating reset vfd control strategies).  You may find this an interesting read from the bottom up.

Hope that saves you a few steps!

Just saying....
I was thinking about upcoming professional events this morning...  All two of us at BPT are planning to attend the fall ASHRAE / IBPSA Energy Modeling conference and would love to find an opportunity to meet with all of the thoughtful energy modelers who have been sharing their insights on this thread.  It would be very nice to put faces with names and talk "shop"!
If you haven't already given some thought to attending the conference, please consider it!  I've attended the last two and found it well worth my time.

Message-ID: <CAB+zL_=_5sO=CZ9baXxKMqe7dLvaBkXcXya_OW3gmidf2W3W3g@mail.gmail.com>

We're in the process of jumping into using EnergyPlus with both feet and
choosing a front end to commit to using and getting trained in. Back when I
used EnergyPlus more regularly (version 1.0.0), the front ends were mostly
non-existent or just getting off the ground and I'm sure there have been a
lot of changes and improvements.

I'm curious to hear about others' recent experience trying to use front
ends to build and calibrate EnergyPlus models. What were the pros and cons
you experienced with a given front end? We're thinking the main choice is
between DesignBuilder and OpenStudio, but we're open to other tools.

In the past, the primary limitation was in the configuration of HVAC
systems. This screamed out for some sort of graphical interface (a la
eQuest). I'm particularly interested in this aspect of the front end and a
few others:

Other primary issues of interest:

   - Ease of creating new models (i.e. when you don't have a building model
   to import)
   - Ease of parametric analysis
   - Ease of extracting hourly output
   - Ease of bringing in an existing idf model
   - Likelihood of a given tool being popular 5 years from no

Thanks a bunch for your insights.

Hi everyone!

I am a masters student and doing my masters in electrical engineering. I am currently working on my thesis. My work in related to air conditioning systems in buildings (Non-HVAC) i.e. using the traditional stand alone air conditioners.?

I need to calculate the energy usage of these traditional Air conditioning systems. can anyone suggest me how can i simulate it using any of the simple and free simulation software. Most of the software's i have seen on internet are build for HVAC systems but in my country HVAC system are still very rare so i have to give my analysis on Traditional Air Conditioning units.?
looking forward to a promising response.

Thank You

Dear all,

I am using eQUEST for a LEED project. After the review, I need to  
change the HVAC System from 6 (Packaged VAV with PFP boxes) to 5  
(Packaged VAV with reheat) in the baseline model.

I made the changes as I thought necessary, and although when I open  
the model it gives me no errors (and there are no errors in the "error  
listing"), when I simulate it says that it cannot complete the  
simulation due to errors. In the BDL file, I see "no heating equipment  
has been defined" or "no cooling equipment has been defined".

Do you have any idea why this might be happening? I would appreciate  
any suggestions on how to fix this. I'm happy to provide the INP file  
or give additional information if that helps.

Thank you very much in advance.

Kind regards,

Eleni

Syed, I wouldn't necessarily consider room air-conditioning systems to be "non-HVAC" - the last two letters stand for "air" and "conditioning" after all!

But whatever we want to call it, you can certainly make a model for these types of systems in eQUEST, OpenStudio/EnergyPlus, etc. and other free and fee software packages.

The bigger unknowns for you will probably how to model the buildings rather than the A/C systems, although you may also have some questions about the age and efficiency of the units that you are considering, if you are modeling typical existing units. Availability of data for new units of this type should be easier to acquire.

Depending on what you are doing with the energy usage data that you collect, would it be possible for you to measure the electricity usage for some of these systems in your region instead of model them?

Good luck!

Thank You David for your response?
Yes these are simple air conditioning systems. I want to do this analysis on My university building having about 250 offices and 400 Air conditioners. Basically what i need to do is calculate the energy or electricity usage of an air conditioner if it operates from 9 A.M. in the morning to 6 P.M. in the evening. I don't really want to get into much details of the building constructions etc.?

Actually i am building an occupancy detection system so i need to evaluate that system in terms of the energy that can be saved if Air conditioners are operated based on the occupancy schedules.?

You have mentioned 3 or 4 softwares which one of these can make me do this task easily. i don't have much time so i need some solution that is fast and appropriate.

Eleni,

The best way for any of us to assist you is to look at and troubleshoot your model file,  is to attach the .pd2, .inp, and your weather file if it is unique.

If you can send these through,  I would be happy to look at your model and give you some ideas to fix the problem.

Syed,

If you want to model accurately you will need to get details on the
construction, the appliances, the lighting etc, in order to calculate the
cooling load of your building (= the heat that needs to be removed). This
is especially true considering what you want to model: this is not as
simple as having something that works full blast or doesn't work at all. By
shutting off the AC when no one is in the room, you'll allow the
temperature of the space to go up, which means next time you turn it on
you'll have some extra load to remove at first, and this is highly
dependent of the building construction.

If you don't want to create a detailed model, you could, as David
suggested, do it empirically. For example by choosing two similar rooms
(surface, orientation, but also how they are being used) and two exact AC
models and strap a meter to each one. Let it run for a week's time or so,
and then on only one of the two AC put your occupancy sensor.

By the way, you don't have to model your entire campus. Depending on the
level of accuracy you're trying to reach, you could just model one room and
consider all exchange surfaces to be adiabatic except the external wall.

Good luck!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Market Assessment on Building Simulation

BLDG-SIM


I thought this community might be interested in a simulation market assessment that our lab put together at the end of 2013.  It is a study that aimed to quantify if and how local (Boise, Idaho) architecture and engineering firms use simulation, and what program's they utilize.  The research also serves as the baseline in benchmarking efforts to track the future adoption of building simulation over time for our area.  Our hope is that we can provide valuable research that will help a firm determine their competitiveness in the market and serve as motivation to consider integrating building simulation into their practice.

You can download the .pdf from our website here:   https://sites.google.com/site/idlbsug/market-assessment

Any comments from this group would be greatly appreciated.  Also, if you know of similar studies, sharing those sources would help us refine future market assessments.


Cheers and thanks!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] System 1 vs System 3 Fan Power Consumption - ASHRAE 90.1
	Appendix G
Message-ID: <6788a70369ddac873e3637aa41f12a09@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,



This question may have been discussed in length somewhere else but I was
not able to find it.



I am working on a mixed use dormitory. There is a restaurant, coffee shop
and university store/gift shop on the first few floors and private rooms
and suites on the upper floors. The building is DX cooling and gas heating.
Based on these conditions I have system 1 and system 3 for the baseline,
system one for the private rooms, system 3 for the other spaces.



Looking at section G3.1.2.9 in ASHRAE 90.1 there are two different
equations for fan power consumption. For systems 1 & 2, it's CFM * 0.3, for
systems 3-8, it's a slightly more complicated equation. However, after
performing the calculations I'm getting roughly CFM * 0.9. If I'm
interpreting this right it means that fan power consumption for systems 1 &
2 is 3 times less than that for systems 3-8.



It's not impossible that a split system, or system 1 type system, could be
installed in the other areas of the building, the mechanical contractor has
proposed as much for budgetary reasons. This would mean that the baseline
system could potentially use as much as 3 times as much energy as the
proposed system, and only because of the ASHRAE fan power consumption
equations.



Is there a reason why there is such a large difference between the two
equations? Or is my classification of the spaces and interpretation of the
equations off?



Thanks!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Database on 179D tax reduction?
Message-ID: <CAETHmJ4HDDpQw+wKpCA7mLQoWeJebdi6-b2Z8EeKK-HTSuVEYg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, all,

I'm wondering if there is some sort of database or archive documenting the
basic information or characteristics of each building that qualified for
partial or full 179d tax reduction.

Maybe I was just dreaming: what about general statics in terms of how many
buildings qualified as well as how many tax reductions dollars are issued?

Best,

Qinpeng

The IRS doesn't collect this data as part of the submissions, so I doubt that it would be available from the "program manager" perspective.

There are several consulting practices that focused extensively or exclusively on this service, you might see if any of them have provided publicly available presentations on the subject.

I'd be interested to hear from anyone that might be associated with DOE or one of the national laboratories if any study was performed where sample data was acquired from providers.

 CBECC-Com beta testing
Message-ID: <A74E88F4004970429432C6B5A251B224746C959E@uscas-002.us.wspgroup.com>

On behalf of the IBPSA-SF Chapter, we are pleased to announce the following event:

Webinar on CBECC-Com beta testing
When: Thursday, February 13, 2014 at 6:00pm - 8:00pm PST
Venue: WSP, 405 Howard Street, Suite 500, San Francisco, CA 94105

Schedule:                   6:00pm -6:30pm -     Networking (If attending in person)
6:30pm - 8pm -         Webinar Presentation

Architectural Energy Corporation (AEC) will be presenting a webinar providing an update on the current feature set of CBECC-Com (the CEC public domain Title 24 compliance software), targeted to the IBPSA San Francisco and Los Angeles Chapters.

The presenter will provide:

- An update on the current feature set of CBECC-Com.

- A webinar training session. The presenter will walk through the process of creating a simple building and its systems, spending an appropriate amount of time on each step and answering questions along the way.

- An overview of the CBECC-Com website (http://bees.archenergy.com/) where people can download the software, view short training video tutorials, and also log any issues they encounter while using CBECC-Com. The issue tracking feature will be an important part of the beta testing.


The webinar will also encourage IBPSA members interested in beta testing to identify any current projects they're working on that may be subject to complying with T24-2013 and use those as the basis for their beta testing. Alternately, any recently completed projects could serve as good test projects.

As testing progresses, IBPSA beta testers will be encouraged to submit any issues they encounter through the project issue tracker.

- AEC's team is contracted with the CEC to provide support to users of CBECC-Com during this beta testing period. We will be able to review problematic input files, error messages generated during a compliance analysis, and generally be available to answer questions.

- This support is not intended to be a substitute for a full-blown training course, so it is expected that beta testers will take time to review the available documentation and online videos.

WEBINAR REGISTRATION:

Please register at: https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/1598469261204813569
Webinar ID: 149-423-179

Seats limited to the first 100.

Unfortunately, there is no way for the IRS to collect any data on the 179D tax deductions, since it is not specifically called out in the tax filing documentation.  I have not seen any data or studies on the application for the 179D tax deduction.  As the author of the technical guide and the 179D DOE Calculator, I respond to a lot of questions about 179D and can provide some anecdotal insight.  Most of the applications for the tax deduction are for lighting under the interim lighting rule because it is easy to qualify for and does not require whole building simulations.  Over the last two years there has been an increase in filings for deductions for HVAC efficiency measures because the IRS lowered the savings level for HVAC and because the 179D DOE Calculator made it easy to calculate the savings.

I just wanted to follow up and share some of the available resources as I
could see there is so much interest on the topic from last night's
discussion.

Check out D3.js which is an open source JavaScript (not JAVA!) library for
data visualization: (http://d3js.org/). There are so many example that you
can find on the page with the source code. For instance, here is the
calender which is really similar to what we saw last night in the
presentation: (http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063318). Scroll down and you
can see the source code. You can also see the license.

Also check out NREL's IDEAKit project for the other interactive graph which
is also using d3 libraries (

To see the source code right click, view page source, or inspect elements.

If you want to get lost in the beauty of result visualization for the whole
Friday then here are my favorites:

Hey Mostapha, thanks for the IDEAKit shout-out! I should mention that NREL is using the d3 lib in the OpenStudio project proper, as well now. d3 is behind the high level results tab, and we also have exposed the reporting functions through the API so you can make your own custom reports, and visualizations powered by d3 and your own imagination:

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Domestic Hot Water Profile for Indoor Soccer Facility
Message-ID: <DUB126-W152641C4DAAC98697D8387E0960@phx.gbl>

Hi all,



I'm looking for some guidance on how to model the domestic hot water 
load for an indoor soccer facility for LEED. The facility is scheduled 
to be open 18 hours per day, every day, with a potential changeover of 
120 people per hour (if each field has max occupancy and is rented out on an hourly basis). So, 120 people could potentially have a shower 
every hour, however, this is not realistic. I do not want to overestimate the energy savings and have 
the LEED reviewer find fault. Has anybody experience modelling a similar situation 
before?



Thanks

D?nal,
There are a lot of variables!

?         Men or women?  (shower length may vary :))

?         How many shower vs leave without showering?

?         Seasonal diversity? (warm months probably have  lower occupancy)

?         Daily diversity? (weekends may see greater use)

ASHRAE 90.1's User Manual does not address this type of occupancy, so I would interview the owner or facility manager and ask a lot of questions to assess these patterns.  If you have the best available data from your client, I doubt that LEED reviewers will quibble.  It will help the reviewers to explain the basis for your calculations.  I think they will appreciate a thoughtful and conscientious modeler.

My experience is to develop a diversity schedule that seems reasonable,
then so long as you keep it the same for the proposed and the baseline it
would be fine. If there is a MEP on the project you should have a peak flow
rate, the peak should be dictated by MEP assumptions, while your schedule
should coincide with MEP WeP1 calculations, that are based on the building
basis of design from the architect and owner assumptions.   The section 1.4
tables provided by USGBC have a section that I found useful in making
assumptions, and also for documentation, see attached example.. For the
attached I used the LEED projects use WeP1 calculations done by MEP for
flow rates based on occupant male vs female. The baseline water use from
the calculation had larger flow rates, also energy savings are achieved by
lower flow rates from the water efficient low flow hot water shower heads
and faucets in the proposed.

Hi sim friends,

I've recently released a new version of my free spatial thermal metrics
visualization plugin for Rhino5; you can now overlay thermal data with
customized climate-based daylight information (*.ill/*.pts, e.g. from
Daysim/DIVA) in such a way that they're easy to read simultaneously- maybe that
is of interest to some folks here. As is the case for thermal display, results
filtering by schedule, custom time range inputs etc. are also exposed for the
daylight component.

Full release log is here: http://mrcomfy.org/?p=605
.. and a first result from a little class testing the tool:
http://mrcomfy.org/?p=585

Enjoy,

Hi Donal,

Usual LEED 2009 projects base the shower uses on FTE/ visitor/ resident
numbers. If you are dealing with a facility that works differently, you'll
probably prefer to base your FTE/ visitor numbers on design assumptions or
information from the facility owner. It is a good idea to check out with
USGBC their opinion on your assumptions before submitting your project. You
can to that bty clicking on USGBC's page contact us link.

Good luck,

Hi all,

I'm trying to assess possible energy savings from improving different areas
of a chiller plant (cooling towers, adding free cooling, VFDs, controls).
Currently all the information I have is a snapshot of the chiller plant
performance at 2pm every day of the summer.

Is there a simple way to evaluate kWh saved? If modelling is the best
option which software is the best for this kind of analysis?

Thanks for any help,
Sebastian

Message-ID: <CAE4kNa6ptDORi+yYrt0Sfp+gMEiberTdTbFbi=V2c2Rbqg5kEQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a question regarding ASHRAE 90.1 baseline system 2 selection.
My proposed building is a high-rise apartment in Denver, and the building
is using electric resistance for space heating.
According to ASHRAE 90.1 requirement, the baseline system would be system 2
PTHP with electrical backup.
As expected, the electric consumed by heat pump is only half of the
electric consumed by the electric resistance, giving me a hard time
achieving the LEED EA prerequisite.
So my question is :
1. Since air source heat pump is not common used in Denver because of the
cold climate, do we still need to use AAHP as our baseline, is there any
exceptional calculation in ASHRAE 90.1?

Thanks in advance,

Te

Dear Sebastian,

I start with kW/ton ratings at AHRI conditions from the manufacturer.  
Those are good inputs into the software.  I use Energy Pro, but I 
believe most software can take that as input.

It is theoretically possible to estimate performance with evaporative 
pre-coolers if you have reliable effectiveness and chiller data.

Most programs will allow VFD or multi-speed pumps as well.

My biggest problem right now is how to develop an hourly cooling load
profile from one-a-day measurements taken in the field. Is there any
standard/general daily cooling profiles that I could use?

Thanks,
Sebastian

Depending on hourly occupancy of the facility I'd start with outside air temperature at the logged hours.

Hi all,

I'm trying to assess possible energy savings from improving different areas of a chiller plant (cooling towers, adding free cooling, VFDs, controls). Currently all the information I have is a snapshot of the chiller plant performance at 2pm every day of the summer.

Is there a simple way to evaluate kWh saved? If modelling is the best option which software is the best for this kind of analysis?

Thanks for any help,
Sebastian

Dear Sebastian,

I start with kW/ton ratings at AHRI conditions from the manufacturer.  
Those are good inputs into the software.  I use Energy Pro, but I 
believe most software can take that as input.

It is theoretically possible to estimate performance with evaporative 
pre-coolers if you have reliable effectiveness and chiller data.

Most programs will allow VFD or multi-speed pumps as well.

For that you need to model the building with local weather data, Sebastian.

And here is some good 2012 data from Seattle- Climate Zone 4C (gathered thanks to code-required energy use reporting).

It's nice to start getting some new data to supplement our knowledge from the pretty-dated CBECS reports.

Message-ID: <CAOQXAFC6zGfkf3NgWxgsb1214Qa4-X9NFRxPwu4iTQ+1u1sOGg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear bldg sim'rs

I'm a little concerned that the plug loads I've modelled in my offices are
low and could leed to some unwanted usgbc comments.

I'm meeting the 25% requirement but the peak load in the offices is 10w/m2.
Whilst i dont think this is overly optimistic the reviewers may think
otherwise. Has anybody had experience of plug loads being queried in detail?

Many thanks

Chris

Chris,

The plug loads are the plug loads. The 25% is just a guidance value from USGBC/GBCI. I've been over and under this level numerous times without a problem.

If you've used the load estimated by the mechanical and/or electrical engineers and apply an appropriate schedule then it should be good enough.

When you're under the 25% threshold a text box will appear for you to explain why. Just state that you've modeled the plug loads as designed.

10 W/m2 sounds a little low for an office. If the owner has made a commitment to use Energy Star devices or laptops for everyone, then 10 W/m2 is plausible. Don't forget to include other equipment like servers/IT equipment, copiers and kitchen equipment (microwave, coffee maker, etc.)

At lower than 25% levels GBCI likely will ask for an itemized list to show that you've considered all of the potential contributors. In addition to Fred's list, add elevators if these aren't separately modeled. Water coolers. Anything that shows up with a connection in the electrical plans.

Chris,

 

My experience has been that if you can provide defensible justification for
your assumptions on plug loads, and state what those assumptions are up
front and why, that reviewers will accept it, even when the "process" loads
in the building don't quite add up to 25%.

 

I've used both the 90.1 User's Manual tables G-B and G-E through G-O and the
COMNET appendices B & C as a basis for receptacle loads and schedules.

 

Thanks,

Steven

This matches my experience as well for plug loads.

I would only plan to itemize plug loads for LEED documentation if attempting to document an energy saving measure above and beyond 90.1 pertaining to receptacle loads (such as plug load circuit controls required by the upcoming title 24).

ASHRAE recommends 0.75 W/ft2 for office building receptacle power density in the user's manual for 90.1-2007 (for when you don't have better data to found the inputs on).  10W/m2 is approximately 0.93W/ft2 (if my math is right), so that's certainly within a reasonable range of expectations.

I do not anticipate you will have any issues.  I've regularly documented exactly the value per the user's manual citing that as the source in my documentation with no further comment.

Brilliant response! Thanks.

If there's a load defined in the design brief then this is typically an 
undiversified design load. I guess an appropriate diversity factor 
should be modelled in this case.

Are the COMNET appendices B&C freely available? I started out with 
COMNET (or at least our software vendor's interpretation of it), but it 
seemed to have quite high plug loads and low occupancy gain.

Cheers

Chris

Hi,

In Canada's norms, there are this table as reference for the plug loads.

Objet : Re: [Bldg-sim] Leed eac1 Plug loads

This matches my experience as well for plug loads.

I would only plan to itemize plug loads for LEED documentation if attempting to document an energy saving measure above and beyond 90.1 pertaining to receptacle loads (such as plug load circuit controls required by the upcoming title 24).

ASHRAE recommends 0.75 W/ft2 for office building receptacle power density in the user's manual for 90.1-2007 (for when you don't have better data to found the inputs on).  10W/m2 is approximately 0.93W/ft2 (if my math is right), so that's certainly within a reasonable range of expectations.

I do not anticipate you will have any issues.  I've regularly documented exactly the value per the user's manual citing that as the source in my documentation with no further comment.

At lower than 25% levels GBCI likely will ask for an itemized list to show that you've considered all of the potential contributors. In addition to Fred's list, add elevators if these aren't separately modeled. Water coolers. Anything that shows up with a connection in the electrical plans.

Chris,

The plug loads are the plug loads. The 25% is just a guidance value from USGBC/GBCI. I've been over and under this level numerous times without a problem.

If you've used the load estimated by the mechanical and/or electrical engineers and apply an appropriate schedule then it should be good enough.

When you're under the 25% threshold a text box will appear for you to explain why. Just state that you've modeled the plug loads as designed.

10 W/m2 sounds a little low for an office. If the owner has made a commitment to use Energy Star devices or laptops for everyone, then 10 W/m2 is plausible. Don't forget to include other equipment like servers/IT equipment, copiers and kitchen equipment (microwave, coffee maker, etc.)

Dear bldg sim'rs

I'm a little concerned that the plug loads I've modelled in my offices are low and could leed to some unwanted usgbc comments.

I'm meeting the 25% requirement but the peak load in the offices is 10w/m2. Whilst i dont think this is overly optimistic the reviewers may think otherwise. Has anybody had experience of plug loads being queried in detail?

Many thanks

Chris

	ETH Zurich, Switzerland
Message-ID: <CAG7SY4vwQfNjwtcnsLu=qFmyqFDvQsKyWnwDSYJTxdwvUKw2dg@mail.gmail.com>

The Assistant Professorship of Architecture & Sustainable Building
Technologies (SuAT) at ETH Zurich, Switzerland has three immediate openings
for:

Research Assistant / PhD Candidate

in the areas of:

1. Design, Modeling and Integration of Advanced Building Systems
Your task will consist in the design, modelling, simulation and performance
assessment of advanced thermal and mechanical building systems. This
includes component sizing, supervision of the installation, and the
post-installation performance evaluation. Also part of your work will be
the project management related to design integration into the actual
building project.

2. Mechanical/Electrical System Design of Dynamic Fa?ades
Your task will consist in researching, designing and prototyping of an
innovative fa?ade system that successfully integrates individual shading
modules into the architecture of the buildings. This will consists of a
lightweight mechanical structure including routing for the electrical
cables and pneumatic components.

3. Modeling and Control of Soft Robotic Actuators for Architectural
Applications
Your tasks will consist in the development and successful implementation of
pneumatic actuator control. This include hardware and software for both
low-level motor control for the individual module, as well as high-level
task control for the entire array comprised multiple modules. You will
compare open vs. closed-loop control strategies and develop classic, model
predictive and advanced controllers. The control strategies will be
evaluated in a long-term real-world scenario including user interaction.

The research of SuAT focuses on new approaches for the design, planning and
operation of buildings as integrated, dynamic systems. The motivation and
aim of our research is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in buildings and
increase the efficiency of energy and resource use of the built
environment. The research is based on the identification and integration of
advanced technologies, methods and processes from the fields of building
systems, information and communication technologies.

The proposed positions are part of an international flagship project to
showcase advances in sustainable building technologies. Please visit our
website (http://suat.arch.ethz.ch/en/open-positions) for more details on
the job descriptions, or apply online at www.jobs.ethz.ch.<
http://www.jobs.ethz.ch.> Please indicate your potential starting date.

Please contact Dr. Zoltan Nagy (nagyz at ethz.ch) with any questions!

Message-ID: <CAF32zMSuQbPkmT1q=zoALjXp2Pt9UMApzgnk7nrPx5jvp4dDiQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Group,

I am wondering if there is a "overcooling" benchmark such as CIBSE
overheating benchmark (1% of occupied period over 28C operative
temperature). I am evaluating a naturally ventilated building and I need a
benchmark to figure out if the building needs a heating system in a pretty
moderated climate.

Many Thanks,

This matches my experience as well for plug loads.

I would only plan to itemize plug loads for LEED documentation if attempting to document an energy saving measure above and beyond 90.1 pertaining to receptacle loads (such as plug load circuit controls required by the upcoming title 24).

ASHRAE recommends 0.75 W/ft2 for office building receptacle power density in the user's manual for 90.1-2007 (for when you don't have better data to found the inputs on).  10W/m2 is approximately 0.93W/ft2 (if my math is right), so that's certainly within a reasonable range of expectations.

I do not anticipate you will have any issues.  I've regularly documented exactly the value per the user's manual citing that as the source in my documentation with no further comment.

At lower than 25% levels GBCI likely will ask for an itemized list to show that you've considered all of the potential contributors. In addition to Fred's list, add elevators if these aren't separately modeled. Water coolers. Anything that shows up with a connection in the electrical plans.

Chris,

The plug loads are the plug loads. The 25% is just a guidance value from USGBC/GBCI. I've been over and under this level numerous times without a problem.

If you've used the load estimated by the mechanical and/or electrical engineers and apply an appropriate schedule then it should be good enough.

When you're under the 25% threshold a text box will appear for you to explain why. Just state that you've modeled the plug loads as designed.

10 W/m2 sounds a little low for an office. If the owner has made a commitment to use Energy Star devices or laptops for everyone, then 10 W/m2 is plausible. Don't forget to include other equipment like servers/IT equipment, copiers and kitchen equipment (microwave, coffee maker, etc.)

Dear bldg sim'rs

I'm a little concerned that the plug loads I've modelled in my offices are low and could leed to some unwanted usgbc comments.

I'm meeting the 25% requirement but the peak load in the offices is 10w/m2. Whilst i dont think this is overly optimistic the reviewers may think otherwise. Has anybody had experience of plug loads being queried in detail?

Many thanks

Chris

Hi Felipe,

Heating tends to be much more critical than cooling. I recommend first
checking local codes (building codes and associated such as housing or
specific for housing depending on where you are and your type of building)
and make sure you reach the threshold they might set on design day. If
there is nothing, you could start with 17?C at night (if its housing) or
19?C during the day or if it's an office building. Anything below that will
start to be uncomfortable. If it's a residential building you could
eventually tolerate a margin for 1% of the time but I suggest making sure
you don't get much lower than 17?C (I'd say 16?C tops at night) otherwise
it'll really be very uncomfortable.

Best,

Hello,

ASHRAE Std. 55 has a chart that you can use for naturally ?conditioned spaces. ? You can determine an acceptable operative temperature based on the mean monthly outdoor temperature. I'm not aware of an acceptable exceedance though.

The ASHRAE standard appears to be written for buildings which eliminate cooling systems but I think the lower line could be used when you are trying to eliminate a heating system?

Felipe is quoting a Cibse overheating criterion for summertime comfort -
not a heating scenario but a cooling one.

Regarding the table/ graph in Ashrae 55. I found it much harder to comply
with than the cibse guidance. I understand that the cibse guidance is
structured to encourage the take up of natural ventilation.

Cibse Method: A full weather year of simulation is done and excessive
temperatures are binned out of the results. Appropriate weather data (hot)
needs to be used for it to be meaningful.

Network airflow is required in the simulation tool.

I think Felipe is looking for comparable criteria.

Message-ID: <CAMrpff-Yf1gwKAVuZmy8dZ3hAcJiJyb=TGwCfH7Czyx-zURkTw@mail.gmail.com>

I would like to raise a question within the same thread context. I am using
eQuest and modeling the process energy for a 25-story hotel as 25% of
baseline energy cost as per LEED default. The process energy includes (All
plug loads/Receptacles, computers, kitchen equipment, laundry, data center,
elevators, etc). I assumed that 25% default value is less than the actual
process energy.

In order to include all above process energy heat dissipation within HVAC
systems simulation for both proposed and baseline models without let eQuest
account for direct energy consumption, I have modeled the heat dissipation
(assumed equal input power value) in eQuest at Space, Equipment Tab,
Internal Energy Sources field, instead of Equipment field.

Is my modeling process at this area correct? Any help, advice, correction
will be highly appreciated.

Thanks Matt for your input, The Revised Section 1.4 spreadsheet input
sheets must be used for projects registered after September 30, 2013, but
can be used by projects with any registered date. My project has been
registered before Sep. 30,2013 and it becomes optional to either comply or
not. From energy saving point of view, using 25% default value for process
load energy will result in more energy saving over the baseline case than
modeling actual process load energy.

The kitchen consultant provides a detail equipment power input and heat
dissipation.

If anyone has better approach or experienced such way, I would like to
hear.

General Query:

There is NO 25% default/threshold/minimum for process loads.

Older versions of LEED literature led us to believe there was an expectation/requirement for process loads to be 25%, or else some extra tier of documentation/justification would kick in and be required ? I believe there was a specific reference to a detailed breakdown in some fashion.  That has since been debunked and the 25% figure is nearly meaningless in the context of LEED energy modeling, except as (very) loose guidance for what might be expected of a ?typical? multistory office building.  In reality, annual process load percentages can vary quite a bit on a case-by-case basis for occupied buildings.

What?s I understand is required of process loads (regardless of annual percentage) is to document the associated inputs, and give the reviewer a brief and clear understanding of where those are sourced from.

For typical projects, I may only provide a few lines in the EAp2 spreadsheet, such as:

-          0.75 W/SF for plug loads, per ASHRAE 90.1 User?s Manual guidance, hourly fractional schedule to represent seasonal usage as per building owner input

-          (2) 9.2kW elevator traction motors, modeled with fractional scheduling per ASHRAE 90.1 User?s manual guidance to represent typical usage for ?Office? buildings

-          5 kW garage ventilation fan load, with scheduling to represent full ON operation during all occupied hours.

I would leave it to the reviewer to determine if anything requires further explanation or detail, and would supply full information for any or all of the above items upon request through the preliminary review process.

For projects with kitchens, laboratories, industrial processes, or similar special cases with complex or substantial process loads, I would provide a more detailed report of those loads for preliminary review ? perhaps by way of attachment or separate upload, if that?s easier.



Equest Query:

Relative to Equipment inputs, Internal energy source inputs allow for greater flexibility in fuel source types: electricity, gas, hot water, and ?process? which represents loads that aren?t associated with your utility meters (e.g. gas-powered forklifts).  Downside is you have to convert electrical loads to Btu/h.

It?s your preference to choose how to utilize either or both space input types ? whatever is convenient to you.  I personally always use the Equipment input for plug loads and other electric-sourced space loads, using Internal energy source inputs only as needed.

For either case, if you wish to remove all or some fraction of the associated heat load, you can edit the ?sensible heat gain ratio? input down zero (default is 1.00).  Also take note there?s a corresponding option for a fraction of the input load to be encountered in the space as a latent heat load (of particular interest for kitchens).

Download the latest version of the LEED table 1.4 spreadsheet and see the comment in the Equipment sheet. Basically, you should not arbitrarily set the load to 25%.

 Also, kitchen equipment should probably have a greater detail on heat generation -- see Ashrae handbooks.

I would like to raise a question within the same thread context. I am using eQuest and modeling the process energy for a 25-story hotel as 25% of baseline energy cost as per LEED default. The process energy includes (All plug loads/Receptacles, computers, kitchen equipment, laundry, data center, elevators, etc). I assumed that 25% default value is less than the actual process energy.

In order to include all above process energy heat dissipation within HVAC systems simulation for both proposed and baseline models without let eQuest account for direct energy consumption, I have modeled the heat dissipation (assumed equal input power value) in eQuest at Space, Equipment Tab, Internal Energy Sources field, instead of Equipment field.

Is my modeling process at this area correct? Any help, advice, correction will be highly appreciated.

Objet : Re: [Bldg-sim] Leed eac1 Plug loads

This matches my experience as well for plug loads.

I would only plan to itemize plug loads for LEED documentation if attempting to document an energy saving measure above and beyond 90.1 pertaining to receptacle loads (such as plug load circuit controls required by the upcoming title 24).

ASHRAE recommends 0.75 W/ft2 for office building receptacle power density in the user?s manual for 90.1-2007 (for when you don?t have better data to found the inputs on).  10W/m2 is approximately 0.93W/ft2 (if my math is right), so that?s certainly within a reasonable range of expectations.

I do not anticipate you will have any issues.  I?ve regularly documented exactly the value per the user?s manual citing that as the source in my documentation with no further comment.

At lower than 25% levels GBCI likely will ask for an itemized list to show that you?ve considered all of the potential contributors. In addition to Fred?s list, add elevators if these aren?t separately modeled. Water coolers. Anything that shows up with a connection in the electrical plans.

Chris,

The plug loads are the plug loads. The 25% is just a guidance value from USGBC/GBCI. I?ve been over and under this level numerous times without a problem.

If you?ve used the load estimated by the mechanical and/or electrical engineers and apply an appropriate schedule then it should be good enough.

When you?re under the 25% threshold a text box will appear for you to explain why. Just state that you?ve modeled the plug loads as designed.

10 W/m2 sounds a little low for an office. If the owner has made a commitment to use Energy Star devices or laptops for everyone, then 10 W/m2 is plausible. Don?t forget to include other equipment like servers/IT equipment, copiers and kitchen equipment (microwave, coffee maker, etc.)

Dear bldg sim'rs

I'm a little concerned that the plug loads I've modelled in my offices are low and could leed to some unwanted usgbc comments.

I'm meeting the 25% requirement but the peak load in the offices is 10w/m2. Whilst i dont think this is overly optimistic the reviewers may think otherwise. Has anybody had experience of plug loads being queried in detail?

Many thanks

Chris

Timur,
I find the DOE Commercial Reference Buildings very useful for examining generic building types.
http://energy.gov/eere/buildings/commercial-reference-buildings

You can also find the models that PNNL researched for various iterations of ASHRAE 90.1 which gives info on newer buildings.
http://www.energycodes.gov/development/commercial/90.1_models

You may have to dig into the data a little bit, but you should be able to find typical space use breakdowns for these building types.  I'm not sure if that's what you're after but they might be helpful.

Hi Timur
Have a look at Section *3.3.1. Zone-typing* on:

*Paul Raftery, Marcus Keane, James O'Donnell*


*Calibrating whole building energy models: An evidence-based methodology,
Energy and Buildings, Volume 43, Issue 9, September 2011, Pages 2356-2364,

It is a good structured process to follow.

Hello all,

I am modelling an industrial building according to European climate.  My
problem is they dont have any data  which i can use for my modelling. So i
need to use the standard data to model. If any one has done before please
help  me.

What could be the appropriate values for lighting , equipment's , Load ,
HVAC and leakage shall be
 used.

Looking forward for help.

Thanks in Advance

You could try the UK NCM databases:
http://www.ncm.bre.co.uk/filelibrary/NCM_databases_v4.1.e.zip

Or, lighting table 9.6.1 in ASHRAE 90.1 and Table G-N in the 90.1 user
manual.

For infiltration, CIBSE guide A section 4 provides guidance including some
look up tables with recommended air change rates - if you already know the
envelope permeability.

Hope this helps.

Chris

Can someone with the knowledge and experience necessary to build a 
smartphone application allowing a person to walk through an existing 
building and create a 3D model with Google's new Project Tango phone go to 
this website, http://www.google.com/atap/projecttango/, and request a 
prototype dev kit?

If you haven't watched the video yet, you should check it out (
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe10ExwzCqk). This would be a great tool 
for creating existing building 3D geometry models. Maybe it could even be 
accurate enough to recognize light fixtures in the ceiling/on the wall and 
the app could ask you to input the fixture wattage while you are in the 
building.

I'm hopeful that this technology will be able to help the AEC industry. 
What do you think?

I just had another idea. What if the app could let you walk through a new 
building in the process of being constructed and it would automatically 
detect studs, ducts, etc. that are located in a different location from 
that of the BIM model (I understand that the building isn't constructed to 
perfectly reflect the BIM model, but it might be helpful in the 
commissioning process or for construction management).

It could also help contractors and sub-contractors visualize the BIM model 
in the field, instead of having to worry about translating the 3D BIM 
model to 2D drawings or carrying around a mobile device with the 3D BIM 
model and trying to navigate it based on where you are standing on the 
site/within the building.

Note that I don't have any actual construction experience, but these are 
ideas I came up with based on what I hear about the construction 
industry/process.

If detecting existing building elements could be as easy as a walkthrough, it would definitely be an amazing feat.  Currently working on projects that have had laser scans of spaces, but the files are HUGE and require someone to manually trace over to create an existing building model. Also, from my understanding, these lasers can't always capture anything overlapping (i.e. stacked ducts) if anything is hidden.  I'm curious how large the models are and how it could best translated to 3D modeling programs like Revit.

I just had another idea. What if the app could let you walk through a new building in the process of being constructed and it would automatically detect studs, ducts, etc. that are located in a different location from that of the BIM model (I understand that the building isn't constructed to perfectly reflect the BIM model, but it might be helpful in the commissioning process or for construction management).

It could also help contractors and sub-contractors visualize the BIM model in the field, instead of having to worry about translating the 3D BIM model to 2D drawings or carrying around a mobile device with the 3D BIM model and trying to navigate it based on where you are standing on the site/within the building.

Note that I don't have any actual construction experience, but these are ideas I came up with based on what I hear about the construction industry/process.

Can someone with the knowledge and experience necessary to build a smartphone application allowing a person to walk through an existing building and create a 3D model with Google's new Project Tango phone go to this website, http://www.google.com/atap/projecttango/, and request a prototype dev kit?

If you haven't watched the video yet, you should check it out (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe10ExwzCqk). This would be a great tool for creating existing building 3D geometry models. Maybe it could even be accurate enough to recognize light fixtures in the ceiling/on the wall and the app could ask you to input the fixture wattage while you are in the building.

I'm hopeful that this technology will be able to help the AEC industry. What do you think?

Those are good points. In terms of the file size and translation to Revit, 
I imagine that there would need to be a way of converting the data into an 
useful 3D model. However, if you watch the youtube video that I posted, 
they showed example augmented reality games that took the geometry data 
from the room provided by the phone and converted into a virtual 3D model 
of the room that had a game world overlaid on top of it. So it seems like 
a similar approach could be used to simplify the data and translate it 
into something that software like Revit could use.

Sorry for some many posts about this, but I just find out that there is a 
company that appears to already be working on a similar solution. 
Matterport (http://matterport.com/industries/#commercial-construction) is 
one of the early testers of Project Tango (http://tcrn.ch/1fhBR1F) and 
they told TechCrunch that it's capabilities are similar to their own 
camera system. It appears that Matterport is able to convert the data into 
an .obj file format which can be opened by the following software 
programs: Autodesk Maya, Autodesk 3dsMax, MeshLab, Blender, Cinema 4d, 
Zbrush, and Unity.

Dear jason,

I presented a paper about this issue in the BSO 2012 in Loughborough - from a more user friendly perspective.
Reference is:

	Analysis
Message-ID: <9739cfdb2837411785d28f19c6d810d9@CO1PR04MB491.namprd04.prod.outlook.com>

BLDG-SIMMERS -


My apologies for the late notice, but our lab is broadcasting our monthly BSUG presentation (4th wed of the month, typically) on the various Revit export options to 3rd party daylight simulation programs.  See below for details:


Date: Feb 26, 12.00-13.00 (MT)


Register:  https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/3390430222254243841?

Description: As Revit evolves and gains more embedded analytical capabilities, its ability to perform daylight analysis is also rapidly evolving.  Currently two main workflows exist.  The traditional workflow exports geometry and material characteristics from Revit into 3rd party daylight simulation software.  Autodesk is rapidly developing a second pathway that allows analysis directly within Revit via a plugin.  This month's BSUG will focus on the export workflow, while March's BSUG will speak towards embedded daylight analysis capabilities within Revit.

Autodesk has made great strides to streamline the export process for Revit to 3rd party daylight analysis programs.  Currently, Revit models can be exported as a GBXML file, a .dxf, or a .dwg.  This presentation will cover the strengths and weaknesses of each pathway, while also featuring a demo of each export procedure.


For more information, visit the BSUG website at https://sites.google.com/site/idlbsug/upcoming-events/feb26bsug20-daylightanalysisthroughrevit-thesagacontinues


Please let me know if you have any questions, hope you can join us!

That assumes of course that the BIM model is correct or that items are modeled as we want them too. :) this is in many cases not the fact and when stuff gets installed in the field many architects have an Oh shit moment when the realize what they drew really doesn't work or look good.

Sorry for some many posts about this, but I just find out that there is a company that appears to already be working on a similar solution. Matterport (http://matterport.com/industries/#commercial-construction) is one of the early testers of Project Tango (http://tcrn.ch/1fhBR1F) and they told TechCrunch that it's capabilities are similar to their own camera system. It appears that Matterport is able to convert the data into an .obj file format which can be opened by the following software programs: Autodesk Maya, Autodesk 3dsMax, MeshLab, Blender, Cinema 4d, Zbrush, and Unity.

If detecting existing building elements could be as easy as a walkthrough, it would definitely be an amazing feat.  Currently working on projects that have had laser scans of spaces, but the files are HUGE and require someone to manually trace over to create an existing building model. Also, from my understanding, these lasers can't always capture anything overlapping (i.e. stacked ducts) if anything is hidden.  I'm curious how large the models are and how it could best translated to 3D modeling programs like Revit.

I just had another idea. What if the app could let you walk through a new building in the process of being constructed and it would automatically detect studs, ducts, etc. that are located in a different location from that of the BIM model (I understand that the building isn't constructed to perfectly reflect the BIM model, but it might be helpful in the commissioning process or for construction management).

It could also help contractors and sub-contractors visualize the BIM model in the field, instead of having to worry about translating the 3D BIM model to 2D drawings or carrying around a mobile device with the 3D BIM model and trying to navigate it based on where you are standing on the site/within the building.

Note that I don't have any actual construction experience, but these are ideas I came up with based on what I hear about the construction industry/process.

Can someone with the knowledge and experience necessary to build a smartphone application allowing a person to walk through an existing building and create a 3D model with Google's new Project Tango phone go to this website, http://www.google.com/atap/projecttango/, and request a prototype dev kit?

If you haven't watched the video yet, you should check it out (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe10ExwzCqk). This would be a great tool for creating existing building 3D geometry models. Maybe it could even be accurate enough to recognize light fixtures in the ceiling/on the wall and the app could ask you to input the fixture wattage while you are in the building.

I'm hopeful that this technology will be able to help the AEC industry. What do you think?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] ASHRAE App G VAV Fan Curve
Message-ID: <AF7766FF9623CB419803ECF0D4FF04F207284A98@UUSNWE1N.na.utcmail.com>

All,
Does anyone know, particularly through having claims accepted by GBCI, whether the ASHRAE App G VAV fan curve is supposed to represent a fan system with or without static pressure reset. I always thought it was supposed to represent a system with sp reset, conforming to 6.5.3.2.3. However, most of the curve power values are even higher than curves representing VAV/VFD systems without sp reset. A confusing aspect is that compared to other VFD fan curves, the power values are high at high flows, but low at low flows, even going to zero at zero flow, though that is really meaningless.

As an aside, the 2013 Title 24 ACM now defines fan curves for central VAV systems with and without sp reset, taken from Taylor's VAV design guide. SP reset is the "baseline" or "standard."A

Thanks for any experience or thoughts on this.

I think it is pretty clear the way 90.1 App. G is written that you SHALL use that specific curve for the baseline VAV system fan power. Now it is a different discussion about whether that curve properly accounts for any ASHRAE required controls strategies, fan performance requirements, etc, but that doesn't really matter, here is the curve to use.

Proposed, as always, should accurately reflect how the system will operate. If you think a more advantageous fan curve is appropriate, such as to account for static pressure reset, go ahead and use it, just as you could create a custom curve for boiler or chiller part-load efficiencies. Don't hide the fact, make it clear to the reviewer that you are using different curves, state the source for your proposed curve and see if they want to comment or challenge the results.

For what it is worth (keeping in mind that past rulings do not set precedent), on multiple projects I have worked on I have used "static pressure reset" fan curves in the proposed, the mandatory baseline fan curve in the baseline, and it has never even been questioned by the reviewer.

Section 6.5.3.2.3 requires static pressure reset for VAV fan system with DDC of individual zones and I believe that requirement predates the fan curve in Appendix G.  Given the prevalence of DDC zones, it seems disingenuous to claim savings for static pressure reset under Appendix G.

It wouldn't take much to run the different published VFD curves out there and use whichever one gives your project the most savings but that is clearly gaming the system.

Thank you Nathan,
I think a reasonable sp reset fan curve is better than the ASHRAE baseline curve at most values of interest.

I did just notice that the ASHRAE curve appears to have been "forced" through 30% power at 50% flow which is the minimum performance listed in 6.5.3.2.1. For some reason, it was also "forced" through zero power at zero flow.

I got 4 mails from them in 2013, all sent via vresp.com. I'm pretty sure
I've never visited energymodels.com website and have no idea who they
are.

The mails don't say where my email was harvested from.

Cheers for that. Give 'em a hard time. Too many companies now think that
any contact gives them a licence to spam you forevermore. And of course
some don't even wait for that initial contact. That didn't used to
happen in the world of real shops. Multiply this by the hundreds of
outfits we deal with every year and the result is a massive PITA.

All,
This is a great example in contrasting styles of applying Appendix G for energy rating and I'm torn between the two as my message indicated. Both provide reasonable justification for their conclusions. Thanks Paul and Nathan. This is the kind of thing USGBC/GBCI should be addressing in the LEED Energy Modeling Guide and eventually ASHRAE. It's also an example of why California is going to the CBECC-Com process for determining compliance with energy models.

Message-ID: <CAMrpff8Znc2UhB9KHHo=gT3M-4EJ-KtqzWei3OgoMpVHzwzA_Q@mail.gmail.com>

* Sorry for the cross posting!

Dear eQuester,

I am modeling a Main hotel kitchen in eQuest, the kitchen is conditioned
with a dedicated AHU including a percentage of outdoor air (input at
outdoor air zone level) within the AHU.

The kitchen equipment hoods are being served with exhaust, ecology, and
make-up fans are working *on-demand bases as variable speed fans*. I have
modeled the kitchen hoods exhaust/make-up fans as following:

- Divided the sum of all exhaust/make-up fans power to the exhaust
airflow *only
*to get (kW/CFM) and input the exhaust airflow and kW/CFM at kitchen zone
level.
- I set the Tracking Ctrl to "*No Airflow Tracking*"
- I set the Exhaust Fan Ctrl to "*Fan-EIR-FPLR*"
- I set the Exhaust Source to "*Balanced Infiltration*", will
be independently controlled and balanced out of AHU.
- I set the Fan Flow Schedule to operate 24-hrs as it ON/OFF schedule!.

I want to know how eQuest will control the fan speed (variably) and fan
power accordingly, is "Fan-EIR-FPLR" control and
its corresponding "Variable Speed Drive FPLR" curve will translate the fan
power according to the "Fan Flow Schedule" operation?

Is there edit shall I do in the Fan flow schedule? It can be a fraction
schedule interlocking to the occupancy schedule?

I would appreciate any suggestion on the above modeling input in such
Variable Kitchen Exhaust case.

If you like pondering these things, consider supply air temperature reset in 90.1 / Appendix G for humid climates.  Then put them together.
I  am starting to see why Wetter et al are interested in virtual controls playgrounds.

All,
This is a great example in contrasting styles of applying Appendix G for energy rating and I'm torn between the two as my message indicated. Both provide reasonable justification for their conclusions. Thanks Paul and Nathan. This is the kind of thing USGBC/GBCI should be addressing in the LEED Energy Modeling Guide and eventually ASHRAE. It's also an example of why California is going to the CBECC-Com process for determining compliance with energy models.

Section 6.5.3.2.3 requires static pressure reset for VAV fan system with DDC of individual zones and I believe that requirement predates the fan curve in Appendix G.  Given the prevalence of DDC zones, it seems disingenuous to claim savings for static pressure reset under Appendix G.  Maybe there is room for claiming improved reset based on oversized ducts and boxes?  It wouldn't take much to run the different published VFD curves out there and use whichever one gives your project the most savings but that is clearly gaming the system.  Since tools are not explicitly modeling the physics of static pressure reset, I suggest it should at least be isolated as an exceptional calculation for review.

I think it is pretty clear the way 90.1 App. G is written that you SHALL use that specific curve for the baseline VAV system fan power. Now it is a different discussion about whether that curve properly accounts for any ASHRAE required controls strategies, fan performance requirements, etc, but that doesn't really matter, here is the curve to use.

Proposed, as always, should accurately reflect how the system will operate. If you think a more advantageous fan curve is appropriate, such as to account for static pressure reset, go ahead and use it, just as you could create a custom curve for boiler or chiller part-load efficiencies. Don't hide the fact, make it clear to the reviewer that you are using different curves, state the source for your proposed curve and see if they want to comment or challenge the results.

For what it is worth (keeping in mind that past rulings do not set precedent), on multiple projects I have worked on I have used "static pressure reset" fan curves in the proposed, the mandatory baseline fan curve in the baseline, and it has never even been questioned by the reviewer.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] ASHRAE App G VAV Fan Curve

All,
Does anyone know, particularly through having claims accepted by GBCI, whether the ASHRAE App G VAV fan curve is supposed to represent a fan system with or without static pressure reset. I always thought it was supposed to represent a system with sp reset, conforming to 6.5.3.2.3. However, most of the curve power values are even higher than curves representing VAV/VFD systems without sp reset. A confusing aspect is that compared to other VFD fan curves, the power values are high at high flows, but low at low flows, even going to zero at zero flow, though that is really meaningless.

As an aside, the 2013 Title 24 ACM now defines fan curves for central VAV systems with and without sp reset, taken from Taylor's VAV design guide. SP reset is the "baseline" or "standard."A

Thanks for any experience or thoughts on this.

Fred,

The reason for "forcing" zero power at zero mass flow rate is because the
temperature raise across the fan is dT = P/m_flow/cp, where P is the power
of the fan, m_flow is the mass flow rate and cp is the specific heat
capacity. If P were not zero at m_flow=0, one would get an infinite large
temperature raise. Forcing P=0 if m_flow=0 is for numerical reasons, which
is important as continuous time simulators cross the region of very small
flow rates when equipment is switched on or off. However, proper
implementation of controls will not simulate the fan at such low speed for
extended periods of time, as this region is outside of the capability of
the real equipment. Therefore, this treatment does not affect your energy
saving calculations.

For a more in-depth discussion about this topic, see Section 4 in
http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/19401493.2013.765506

All the best,

Michael

Hi Fred,

I dove into this topic some time back specifically trying to understand the Appendix G curve in relation to reset strategies and the DOE2/eQuest default library curves.

Attached discussion (and attached discussions therein) recounts a lively discussion and some helpful visuals I produced to establish my observations, concluding the App. G curve is ultimately... not clear on the matter (and thus inappropriate for direct use in evaluating reset vfd control strategies).  You may find this an interesting read from the bottom up.

Hope that saves you a few steps!

Just saying....
I was thinking about upcoming professional events this morning...  All two of us at BPT are planning to attend the fall ASHRAE / IBPSA Energy Modeling conference and would love to find an opportunity to meet with all of the thoughtful energy modelers who have been sharing their insights on this thread.  It would be very nice to put faces with names and talk "shop"!
If you haven't already given some thought to attending the conference, please consider it!  I've attended the last two and found it well worth my time.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] ASHRAE App G VAV Fan Curve

All,
Does anyone know, particularly through having claims accepted by GBCI, whether the ASHRAE App G VAV fan curve is supposed to represent a fan system with or without static pressure reset. I always thought it was supposed to represent a system with sp reset, conforming to 6.5.3.2.3. However, most of the curve power values are even higher than curves representing VAV/VFD systems without sp reset. A confusing aspect is that compared to other VFD fan curves, the power values are high at high flows, but low at low flows, even going to zero at zero flow, though that is really meaningless.

As an aside, the 2013 Title 24 ACM now defines fan curves for central VAV systems with and without sp reset, taken from Taylor's VAV design guide. SP reset is the "baseline" or "standard."A

Thanks for any experience or thoughts on this.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Choosing a Front End for EnergyPlus
Message-ID: <CAB+zL_=_5sO=CZ9baXxKMqe7dLvaBkXcXya_OW3gmidf2W3W3g@mail.gmail.com>

We're in the process of jumping into using EnergyPlus with both feet and
choosing a front end to commit to using and getting trained in. Back when I
used EnergyPlus more regularly (version 1.0.0), the front ends were mostly
non-existent or just getting off the ground and I'm sure there have been a
lot of changes and improvements.

I'm curious to hear about others' recent experience trying to use front
ends to build and calibrate EnergyPlus models. What were the pros and cons
you experienced with a given front end? We're thinking the main choice is
between DesignBuilder and OpenStudio, but we're open to other tools.

In the past, the primary limitation was in the configuration of HVAC
systems. This screamed out for some sort of graphical interface (a la
eQuest). I'm particularly interested in this aspect of the front end and a
few others:

Other primary issues of interest:

   - Ease of creating new models (i.e. when you don't have a building model
   to import)
   - Ease of parametric analysis
   - Ease of extracting hourly output
   - Ease of bringing in an existing idf model
   - Likelihood of a given tool being popular 5 years from no

Thanks a bunch for your insights.
