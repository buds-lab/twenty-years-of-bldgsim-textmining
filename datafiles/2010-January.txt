Section 4.4.1 ? I don?t feel there?s enough emphasis on extra zone equipment
here. Most DOAS systems will require something like fan coils (European fan
coils!) or DX terminal units to meet the full heating and cooling
requirements.

 

In Section 4.4.2:

 

Radiant system design and application are still in development in the United
States, while they are

more widely adopted in Europe. Unlike VAV systems, there is no well
established radiant system design.

Building surfaces used in a radiant system can be floors, ceilings, and
walls, though the first two are most

commonly applied.  *And chilled beams ? maybe a bit complicated to model,
especially active beams*

 

Different radiant surfaces have different heating and cooling capacities. A
radiant

floor system has a larger heating capacity than its cooling capacity because
radiant floor heating has a

larger heat exchange coefficient between the floor and the space than
radiant floor cooling. According to

Babiak et al. (2009), a radiant floor system normally has a maximum heating
capacity of about 100 W/ft?

(1075 W/m2) and a maximum cooling capacity of about 40 W/ ft? (430 W/m2).
*Er..., how many watts per m2?* 

 

In areas exposed to direct sunlight, the radiant cooling capacity can
increase up to 100 W/ ft? (1075 W/m2). However, floor carpets

may reduce the heating and cooling capacity by as much as 50%. In contrast
to a radiant floor system, a

radiant ceiling has a maximum heating capacity of about 40 W/ ft? (430 W/m2)
and a maximum heating

capacity of about 100 W/ ft? (1075 W/m2) (Babiak et al. 2009). *a maximum
_heating_ capacity of 430 W/m2 and a maximum _heating_ capacity of 1075
W/m2, which one shall I choose :$*

 

*suspended timber floors can be heated but offer lower W/m2 than concrete/
screed systems* 

*profiled concrete soffits can offer further cooling advantages*

Hi All,

 

Just an FYI on a recent publication (Sept. 09) available for free online:

 

?Technical Support Document: 50% Energy Savings Design Technology Packages
for Medium Office Buildings?

http://www.pnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-18774.p
df

 

I just glanced through it (138 page document ? 1.2MB file) but I see a lot
of good stuff on efficient design and energy modeling.

Good explanations on modeling baseline and proposed models using ASHRAE
Standard 90.1, with specifics on radiant heating and cooling,

DOAS, VAV and many of the ECMs that would typically be considered for an
energy-efficient design.

 

There are lots of tips for EnergyPlus users, since that?s what was used for
the modeling, but much of the document applies to anyone modeling

ASHRAE 90.1 baselines and subsequent conservation measures.

 

Cheers,

Bill

Does anyone know of any studies or guidelines for various levels of
building simulations? What should it cost to do a building simulation?

I had received three quotes on modeling a building (to match existing
utility bills within 10%) that were quite disparate. It got me to
thinking about cost guidelines. Are there any? What do utilities use?

Kevin,

Costs at the schematic design phase would be cheap - typically less than a
week is spent working on a model at this point (depending on size &
complexity).
At DD and CD the costs increase depending on size and complexity of the
project. CD being more costly than DD.
The only standard that I know of that holds true for energy modeling is
"you get what you pay for." Even in today's economy energy models are
fairly well sought after.

What I do for a detailed CD level model is estimate hours based off a
square foot basis, our typical analysis used to take 1200 Sq. Ft. / Hr.
I've been able to develop a streamlined process using Revit - gbXML and
Trace to get the amount of time down to about 7000 Sq. Ft. / Hr. This is
for a building that is in construction, the architectural design is already
in Revit, and the building was built "correctly" in Revit.

Your case is a bit more intensive. The efficiencies that are incorporated
by gbXML and Revit probably don't apply because you probably don't have an
existing plan in Revit. I would default back to the 1200 Sq. Ft. / Hr. plus
some time for calibration. For a calibrated energy model LEED NC v2.2
references the International Performance Measurement & Verification
Protocol Volume III April 2003 (www.ipmvp.org).

I would also try contacting Jeff Haberl, he contributed to "writing the
book" on energy modeling along with many others of course. I've seen many
of his posts on this BB.  He is also sited in the IPMVP on the technical
committee and new construction sub-committee. I'm sure he can give you a
good idea of pricing for your scenario.

Take care,
Shariq

Chicago is a deregulated electricity market (ComEd), so although you may find examples of bundled rates these aren't used by the majority of commercial customers.

Same thing for natural gas, in this case from People's Gas.

See attachments.  I think I might still have several old utility rates in DOE2.1E inp/bdl format.  After creating the eQUEST model, insert the 2.1E utilty inp section at the end of the eQ inp file, open the eQ pd2, get the error messages and fix the DOE2.2 inp file.  eQ separates the schedules from the rates so it is difficult to see what is going on.

Bldg-sim subscribers,
I am interested in learning about your experiences with Ecotect.  I am particularly interested in learning about its relative strengths and weaknesses as a schematic design tool.  Our firm is in the process of integrating it more fully into our design process and while I'm sure we will learn by experience it would be helpful to hear some "war stories" from others.  I would also like to hear about your relative reliance on Ecotect versus other modeling tools in the early stages of design.

Help, I Can't Post
------------------

90% of the time if you cannot post it is because you are
sending from a different email address than the one you
originally subscribed from. Please see "Changing Options"
below to fix this. You can even change your email address
for all of the mailing lists at once.

Changing Options
----------------

Go to the main web page

   http://onebuilding.org/

Click on the link on the left for the mailing list you want
to change your options on. At the bottom of the page for the
specific mailing list, in the field near the button
"unsubscribe or edit options" enter your email address and
press that button. The next page will ask for a password, if
you don't remember yours click on the remind button and one
will be emailed to you. From  this page you can change to
digest mode or your email address or other options.

Archives
--------

Each of the building energy simulation mailing lists have
archives of the messages posted. There is a good chance you
can find the answer you are looking for by searching the
archives. Go to

   http://onebuilding.org/

In each paragraph about the mailing list is a link to the
archives. You can search that list from that page. In
addition, you can use Google to search the entire site
across all mailing lists by going to:

   http://onebuilding.org/search.html

Digest Mode
-----------

If you would rather receive a single email each day with all
of the messages within it, you can use Digest Mode. See the
"Changing Options" section above to turn on Digest Mode.

Links to Related Sites
----------------------

If you are interested in other simulation program mailing
lists or other sites related to building energy simulation,
see the list of links at:

http://onebuilding.org/links.html

If you have suggestions for additional links, please send me
an email.

Subject Lines
-------------

For BLDG-SIM, if the question is about a specific simulation
program, please include the name of the simulation program
in the subject line. Also please post a question about a
specific simulation program to the appropriate mailing list
first to see if you can get an answer and post to BLDG-SIM
the next day if you have not. If you are replying to a
message in a digest, please see the section below.

Replying to a Digest
--------------------

If you receive a digest, when replying to a message in the
digest, please copy the original subject line and don't
include the entire digest when replying. Just include the
original message.

I Still Need Help

Thank you Bill for posting our recent publication on 50% TSD for Medium Office.  This report has been updated with very minor editorial changes.  The most recent version is available for free download at the following link:

http://www.pnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-19044.pdf


Regarding Chris comments on DOAS, I agree, DOAS has to work with other HVAC equipment to provide full heating and cooling requirement.  So the system we evaluated in the report is DOAS with radiant systems.

Thanks,
Bing

Section 4.4.1 - I don't feel there's enough emphasis on extra zone equipment here. Most DOAS systems will require something like fan coils (European fan coils!) or DX terminal units to meet the full heating and cooling requirements.

In Section 4.4.2:

Radiant system design and application are still in development in the United States, while they are
more widely adopted in Europe. Unlike VAV systems, there is no well established radiant system design.
Building surfaces used in a radiant system can be floors, ceilings, and walls, though the first two are most
commonly applied.  *And chilled beams - maybe a bit complicated to model, especially active beams*

Different radiant surfaces have different heating and cooling capacities. A radiant
floor system has a larger heating capacity than its cooling capacity because radiant floor heating has a
larger heat exchange coefficient between the floor and the space than radiant floor cooling. According to
Babiak et al. (2009), a radiant floor system normally has a maximum heating capacity of about 100 W/ft?
(1075 W/m2) and a maximum cooling capacity of about 40 W/ ft? (430 W/m2). *Er..., how many watts per m2?*

In areas exposed to direct sunlight, the radiant cooling capacity can increase up to 100 W/ ft? (1075 W/m2). However, floor carpets
may reduce the heating and cooling capacity by as much as 50%. In contrast to a radiant floor system, a
radiant ceiling has a maximum heating capacity of about 40 W/ ft? (430 W/m2) and a maximum heating
capacity of about 100 W/ ft? (1075 W/m2) (Babiak et al. 2009). *a maximum _heating_ capacity of 430 W/m2 and a maximum _heating_ capacity of 1075 W/m2, which one shall I choose :$*

*suspended timber floors can be heated but offer lower W/m2 than concrete/ screed systems*
*profiled concrete soffits can offer further cooling advantages*

Subject: [Bldg-sim] 50% Energy Savings Design for Medium Office Buildings - free resource

Hi All,

Just an FYI on a recent publication (Sept. 09) available for free online:

"Technical Support Document: 50% Energy Savings Design Technology Packages for Medium Office Buildings"
http://www.pnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-18774.pdf

I just glanced through it (138 page document - 1.2MB file) but I see a lot of good stuff on efficient design and energy modeling.
Good explanations on modeling baseline and proposed models using ASHRAE Standard 90.1, with specifics on radiant heating and cooling,
DOAS, VAV and many of the ECMs that would typically be considered for an energy-efficient design.

There are lots of tips for EnergyPlus users, since that's what was used for the modeling, but much of the document applies to anyone modeling
ASHRAE 90.1 baselines and subsequent conservation measures.

Cheers,
Bill

Message-ID: <25F2BDB6656B8F40A1289ED906D6B5CF06D4A65C@EXCHANGE1.cadd_group.ghtltd.com>

I was curious if anyone could confirm their experience with App G fan
power calculations for FCUs vs real life equipment values.

 

For AHUs, VAV boxes, etc, most average equipment consumes power nearly
identical to the fan power calculations of App G.  Usually a little bit
better, but nothing major unless you start specifying ECM motors in VAV
boxes, fan walls for AHUs, etc.

 

But for FCUs:  I've got a project with 100+, and most of them come out
to about 0.0008 KW / cfm per the calculations.

 

However, fairly standard FCU selections (from McQuay, not that it
matters), use about 0.0003 KW / cfm.  That's almost a third of the
energy use, and when the entire building is FCU, it makes a huge
difference.

 

Can someone confirm their experience?  I'm not complaining, but I just
want to make sure there isn't some addendum that changes the fan power
calcs for very low CFM HVAC systems.

 

Thanks!

James,
 
That's an error in ASHRAE 90.1-2004 that was later corrected in the
addenda and incorporated into the 2007 version. With the correction, the
fan power allowance drops by more than 50% (from what I recall) for
these small systems.

And Jonathan informed me that ASHRAE corrected this is a later addendum,

James,

 

There is no baseline system that uses FCUs, so the fan power calculation
is not applicable to your proposed FCU's.

Hi,

be taken for wall and roof absorptance as it mentions for U value . As
absorptance value has great impact on heat gains and further on energy

Can we have a better wall absorptance in proposed case from base case
so to improve energy performance

Any response will be highly appreciable.

Table G3.1 5c (for Proposed) and 5d (for Baseline) mentions how to model the reflectance (1-absorptance) of both the baseline and proposed roof. The baseline must be modeled with a reflectivity of 0.3. The proposed must be either 0.3, or 0.45 if the proposed roof has a reflectance of 0.7 or greater.

I have not seen anything in 90.1 about modeling the reflectance of walls.

Hello Sambhav,

In regard to exterior surface solar reflectance, ASHRAE 90.1 focuses only on 
roofs and not walls.  In the 90.1-2007 version, Table 5.5.3.1 has U-Factor 
requirements for high albedo roofs (formerly referred to as "cool roofs".) 
This single table is a replacement for the roof U-Factor requirements found 
in Tables 5.5-1 through 5.5-3 (i.e., climate zones 1 through 3.)  The 
definition of "high albedo" is found earlier in Section 5.5.3.1.1 as roofs 
with a minimum Solar Reflective Index (SRI) of 0.82.  Typically, this is a 
roof of high emissivity as well as high reflectance.  The 90.1 User's Manual 
shows values that achieve an SRI of 0.82 in Table 5-D, ranging from an 
(e=0.75, refl=0.7) to (e=0.1, refl=0.81) combinations.

Greetings Aditya,

 

As of TRACE 6.2.3, there is an active chilled beam system type available, though I have yet to test it out.  Theoretically you could model a four-pipe active chilled beam and set the main and auxiliary cooling coil capacities to zero while inputting the desired heating capacities (see the help file).  The DOAS is modeled via the 'dedicated OA' tab and under the 'options' tab there is location to select the enthalpy wheel.  TRACE doesn't support biomass boilers but depending on what information you need you could approximate the behavior.  

 

Hope this helps,

Stephen

LEED and high performance building projects.  His experience includes
establishing project energy goals (including net zero energy),
integrating simulation into the design process and post occupancy
evaluation of energy performance.

Jim

 

I am not a modeler, but I interacted with the experts at TRANE using a
demo package they provided me.  

 

I told them I wanted to use one of their building design templates and
change only the parameter for infiltration.  We used an elementary
school in Wisconsin with a CMU back-up wall and brick cladding.  TRANE
showed me where the default air leakage parameter for that building
design template was located, and they showed me how to change it to
match the air leakage rate called out by the Air Barrier Association of
America.  We ran the model before and after, and it showed a 58%
decrease in natural gas consumption and a 22% decrease in electricity
consumption.  Right in line with the NIST study.  They confirmed to me
that no matter what design was created for the model, a default air
leakage rate would be generated by the software.

Jim,

 

I would draw your attention to the following resources:

 

The Air Infiltration & Ventilation Centre (AIVC) - great set of reading
resources for this sort of stuff - my PhD and subsequent work has loads of
references that are held by their central library. http://www.aivc.org/

 

Also worth checking out the International Journal of Ventilation, useful
stuff there too:  http://www.ijovent.org.uk/

Edited by essentially a who's who of ventilation research, it's an excellent
resource, albeit very academic based.  Also has a useful online combined
natural & mechanical  ventilation calculation tool :
http://phpaida.veetech.org.uk/phpaida.php

 

Also worth using the tables in the CIBSE Guide A.

 

Hope this helps.

Paul

Speaking of renewable energy, I was viewing IBPSA online and noticed only papers on coanda effect to mechanical jet fossil fuels.  Does anyone have a great read on coanda over naturally occurring fluid flow phenomena on the grand scheme?  I am interested in hybridizing ventilation should the right client come along and went to stay ahead of the pack.  It would absolutely delightful if someone would share documents on controlled vortices quantifying fluid flow as well.

Might anyone be of assistance?  I might just have to be resolved to going through the US Justice department and so-called " US Freedom of Information Act".

Perhaps someone knows a quanta discussion group that might offer a little insight.

You might try Coanda Research & Development Corporation.
http://www.coanda.ca/

 

For a US outfit, I'd start with the Idaho National Laboratory.  One of
DOE's big R&D and operations labs.  They have a huge fluidized bed
calciner and have had a lot of time and money to figure out flow issues.
Also, they are fabulous people to work with.

Hello from Sydney,

 

My name is Abel Orellana and I work for the University of Sydney. I sit
in our research team within the recruitment division and I am partnering
with the Faculty of Architecture, Design & Planning in the effort to
locate suitable candidates for the appointment of a Senior
Lecturer/Lecturer Architectural Design/Digital Architecture.

 

When doing some preliminary research I found this listserv and thought
it would be a great place to ask for assistance from some professionals
already in the field. 

 

Given the focus of the role will be around academic leadership and
teaching of digital media in architecture, I wanted to get in contact
with members of this list to see if you were able to point me in the
right direction and possibly provide some advice on the best avenues
through which to get a communication out to individuals who may be
interested in a new challenge (and a move to the sunny shores of
Sydney!).

 

I am really looking for some advice on potential advertising mediums,
such as journals, forums and associations and potentially any other
listserv/mailing list which may be helpful in spreading the word...

 

A little more about the position:

 

The successful applicant will teach in design studios, particularly in
the March Digital Architecture Research Studio and in Architectural
Communications in the undergraduate BDesArch course, develop
opportunities for interaction and cross-teaching and research between
staff of the Design Lab and Architecture programs, develop a program of
research in architectural computing and supervise undergraduate Honours
and postgraduate research student.

 

You will have a demonstrated track record in research publications
and/or peer-assessed creative input, the ability to teach in an
architectural design studio, a track record in applying for competitive
research grants or competitive commissions and a record of higher degree
research supervision.

 

The Faculty is particularly interested in hearing from candidates with
research interests in one or more of the following areas: urban
computing, parametric modelling, generative design, kinetic
architecture, computer-supported collaborative design,
building-information modelling, responsive/smart spaces and digital
fabrication technologies.

 

The position is full-time continuing subject to the completion of a
satisfactory probation period for new appointees. Membership of a
University approved superannuation scheme is a condition of employment
for new appointees.


Remuneration package: a competitive remuneration package is available
(consisting of a base salary Level B/C $78,538 p.a - $96,207 p.a, leave
loading and up to 17% employer's contribution to superannuation).

 

 

More specific information relating to the role can be found here: Senior

Subject: [Bldg-sim] eQuest 3.63b Parametric Run Anomalies
Message-ID: <B52C5E069621CB488186E0E402E3D7B703AD8F91@longex07.denver.dom>

Hello,

 

I'm using the parametric runs feature to track the interactive effects
of a suite of control sequence modifications to a baseline model.  The
results of the these parametric runs are nonsensical demand (kW) spikes
in the space heating end use category, which do not translate into
increased energy consumption.  Also, some p-runs result in wildly
negative heat loads.  Is there a known bug or bug fix for this?

 

Thanks!

Message-ID: <531759081001181553l7a2a70a6k8f89b07c7f6a2001@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all;

I'm interested in using FEA to model the heat-transfer characteristics of
several building envelope designs. I'm attempting to use Elmer (
http://www.csc.fi/english/pages/elmer) to do this. Because Elmer doesn't do
anything more than very simple mesh creation, I'm using GiD (
http://gid.cimne.upc.es/) to attempt to mesh my wall section.

However, I'm having some serious problems creating a mesh. I'm not overly
experienced in mesh creation, but I have a feeling this stems from the
ridiculous aspect ratio of several parts of the assembly (ie, a 11' x 6' x
5/8" sheet of drywall) and the relatively minuscule thickness (~1/16") of
the steel studs and z-girts that are in the construction.

I'm wondering if anyone has conducted any such analysis before and could
offer some meshing tips. Alternatively, can anyone recommend a resource I
could consult?

Many thanks,

Josh

It's restricted to 2d but I've always found LBNL Therm to be good.

Josh,

I don't have any experience with Elmer or GiD, but I do have some experience with ANSYS. When we ran into parts with large aspect ratios, we would try and use 2-D or 1-D elements. The drywall and studs will predominantly conduct heat in one direction anyways. You can check this with a quick Biot number calculation. So, if GiD has these type of elements available I would try using them in concert with your 3-D elements.

Yeah - two walls. Make the whole wall in the Wizard, then separate them in the Detail Edit mode.

The Wizard actually gets in the way of this one, as I used to make multiple walls with X-Y-Z cooridinates all the way back to DOE-2.1A (quill pen days, folks)..

Somebody already pointed out, but to clarify, THERM program does excellent
job at modeling 2-D heat transfer in building envelopes.  It was originally
developed for modeling fenestration systems (windows, doors, etc.), but it
can be used for any other fa?ade element, since they are generally simpler
than intricate details of window frames.  The benefits of using THERM are
numerous, but to cite few most important ones:

 

-          Free with simple registration (don?t be fooled by the fact that
it is free to the public, because substantial funding went into its
development by US DOE)

-          Has automated mesher and error estimator/mesh refinement with no
user intervention (fully automated quality mesh generation)

-          Has powerful drawing capabilities and import from dxf and scanned
drawings

-          Has extensive library of building materials (users can add their
own, but the built in library is impressive)

-          Has built in correlations for convective heat transfer in
building cavities

-          Has library of default boundary conditions appropriate for
buildings (user can add their own too)

-          In addition to 2-D conduction heat transfer model, has detailed
radiation model using grey body radiation enclosure algorithms for both
cavitie4s and indoor/outdoor boundaries

-          Calculates U-factors based on indoor-outdoor temperature
difference.

-          Has powerful output capabilities (color flooded plots of
temperatures, heat fluxes, mesh display among other things)

I'll be working on an energy modeling project in the latter part of 2010
and the client requires that all software be formally validated via
Quality Assurance/Quality Control procedures.  My question for the
message board is in regard to is there anyone who has gone thru this
process with eQuest specifically and if so, were you able to acquire an
example external source eQuest file (inputs and outputs) so you could
reproduce the same inputs and outputs on the validated
software-installed computer?  

 

On the doe2.com website there is the following...

DOE-2.2 Reports and Modeling Quality Control Concepts

(The DOE-2.2 Reports-and-QC download is a ZIP archive that contains a
set of three documents in Adobe's Portable Document Format (PDF) and
example eQUEST/DOE-2.2 input and DOE-2.2 simulation results output; the
documents provide an explanation of the detailed DOE-2.2 output text
results file.):

<http://doe2.com/download/eQUEST/DOE22Reports-and-QC_2001-06-07.zip> 

...but, that link is dead. (anyone have this .zip file already
downloaded??)

 

There was a post from 2008:

> Dear all,

>  

> Is there any validation or testing form that we can find e-Quest 

> results are correct.

> like for energy plus has been tested against the IEA Bestest building 

> load and HVAC test.

 

Which got this in response:

The results of ASHRAE 140 testing of eQUEST are posted in the doe2.com 
eQUEST download area:
 
http://doe2.com/download/equest/ASHRAE_Standard140_DOE22-eQUEST_Results.

...but where would I be able to find the exact inputs and outputs used
and generated via this ASHRAE 140 test?

 

Any thoughts or suggestions welcome...thanks!

The California Energy Commission has approved the use of a new fenestration rating system called NFRC ?Component Modeling Approach? or ?CMA? in its 2008 update to Title 24. This new rating system generates more precise performance ratings for nonresidential site-built fenestration, providing a better alternative to using the CEC Default Tables in Title 24.

 

How does this effect Energy Consultants?

CMA enables you to provide the following services:

*	Model envelope/fenestration products to maximize energy efficiency
*	Obtain credit for high performance fenestration products in energy compliance
*	Compare energy performance of fenestration components and products
*	Eliminate the requirement for lab-testing of site-built fenestration products
*	Create label certificates from a virtual library of existing fenestration products

 

Want to Learn More?

Sign up for one a free webinar on ?CMA and Title 24 2008:? 

 

January 28th, 2010*

Message-ID: <6B717D4C6A431A4999E8441F2B85FE6202B4F189@ch-kemaexch3.kemaus.com>

Hi, 

I am modeling a chiller with 4-pipe fan coil units in each of the spaces
for a high school building. The fans are cycling on at night. There is a
Gas Boiler heating system. 
I see some space cooling happening in the winter periods during the
night when there should be very minimal internal load. The only way I
can justify this is that this is the supply fan heat energy for the fan
coil unit in the space and it comes out as cooling electrical end use
(in the BEPU AND BEPS reports) because there is no electrical heating
end use due to it being a gas system and electrical fans end use is for
ventilation. 

Has anyone come across this before, do I seem right on my assumption? 

If anyone could help me out, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks &

Dear Paul,
 
I was very interested by your email and want to enquire whether, in the
TRANE model, they define a fixed assumption of air leakage rate for the
baseline building. 
 
If so, would you know what that figure is?

Jim

 

I am not a modeler, but I interacted with the experts at TRANE using a
demo package they provided me.  

 

I told them I wanted to use one of their building design templates and
change only the parameter for infiltration.  We used an elementary
school in Wisconsin with a CMU back-up wall and brick cladding.  TRANE
showed me where the default air leakage parameter for that building
design template was located, and they showed me how to change it to
match the air leakage rate called out by the Air Barrier Association of
America.  We ran the model before and after, and it showed a 58%
decrease in natural gas consumption and a 22% decrease in electricity
consumption.  Right in line with the NIST study.  They confirmed to me
that no matter what design was created for the model, a default air
leakage rate would be generated by the software.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Infiltration baseline for modeling

 

Hi all,

If I'm using Ashrae 90.1 2004, where building leakage hasn't been
defined yet, what should a 'baseline' level of infiltration be?  Any
thoughts / experience with this?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] using TAS for LEED EAcr1
Message-ID: <E563595CB7ABF64AAC1B3F5D25AC76011E52C2@edsl-sbs01.EDSL.local>

Hi Xavier,

 

Tas can be used for LEED certification, as we meet the 'Simulation
General Requirements' outlined in Section G2, p173 of AppendixC-G, and
Section 11.2, p66 of Chapter8-AppendixB of ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA Standard
90.1-2007. The document itself is licensed, but a free version is
available to view online at 
http://openpub.realread.com/rrserver/browser?title=/ASHRAE_1/ashrae_90_1
_2007_IP_1280.

 

My understanding is that USGBC are the adopting authority and have
stated LEED energy predictions must comply with 90.1. In turn, this
requires the software to comply with ASHRAE 140-1 2004, which Tas does.
To demonstrate compliance, it is required that we publish our results,
which we have done and these data are available from our website:

 

http://www.edsl.net/main/Software/Validation/ASHRAE.aspx

 

We have not finalised the new front-end (which will be known as the
ASHRAE 90.1 Studio) for 'guiding' a user through the process of a LEED
project, so the user will need to do most of the work themselves using
knowledge of the regulations and the Plant Modelling macro. Tas has been
used this way for LEED projects by other customers, for example Hilson
Moran.

 

It is hoped that the new software component will be released around the
middle of this year. In the meantime, there is a video preview of the
tool on our website:

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Baseline for Instantaneous electric water heaters
Message-ID: <72A74BE7A31A4244B7FAF420FF5D9783619B4C@HMP107.hilson_moran.local>

Hi all,

 

I'm modeling an office building where service hot water is provided by
electric instantaneous water heaters located in every toilet.

What would be the baseline case minimum performance requirements for
LEED according to ASHRAE 90.1-2004?

Table 7.8 lists only gas instantaneous water heaters. Do instantaneous
water heaters fall into the Electric Water Heater type from table 7.8?

In this case, how do I translate minimum performance requirements listed
in ASHRAE (EF and SL) in eQUEST inputs?

 

Many thanks

Subject: [Bldg-sim] White Box Technologies announces the establishment of a
 Center for Open Source Building Simulations
Message-ID: <4B58BEA5.5080602@whiteboxtechnologies.com>

Dear Friends and Colleagues,

White Box Technologies wishes to announce its intention to establish a 
non-profit Center for Open Source Building Energy Simulations (COSBES). 
I admit the title may sound a bit on the grandiose side, but it 
capsulizes my thinking on what may help our little world of building 
energy simulations - a non-profit non-commercial center on simulation 
programs and resources that's in the public domain.

My initial goals are very modest, but my long-range vision is for the 
Center to be capable of significant software development and support, 
but always open source. My first steps are simply to maintain an 
open-source version of DOE-2.1E. DOE-2.1E has been effectively abandoned 
by LBNL and DOE for close to a decade. I have assurances from LBNL that 
it's only a matter of paperwork for them to make the program open 
source, and have communicated to them my intentions without receiving 
any objections.

So what would this support consist of, besides making the program and 
source code freely available? That would of course depend on the 
public's (your) interest and need, which is one reason for this 
announcement! But for starters, I have a backlog of completed work that 
have never been incorporated into the public release version of 
DOE-2.1E, such as two-dimensional and combined response factors for 
composite walls, a decent foundation model, and an improved weather file 
format.  In addition, I'm currently working on contract for ORNL to 
incorporate AtticSim into 2.1E. Lastly, I have a license from LBNL to 
continue working on my last major work there - a partially-completed 
DOE-2 to EnergyPlus translator (doe2ep) that, funding pending, can be 
updated to the current EnergyPlus release. Also in the works and soon to 
be launched are (1)  VisualEPlus, a graphical user interface for 
EnergyPlus done by colleagues in China, and (2) actual-year weather data 
service accessing NCDC's massive International Surface Hourly (ISH) data 
base.

I had originally thought of calling a meeting at ASHRAE to make this 
announcement, but then realized that finding a time to meet at ASHRAE is 
an impossibility. However, I would be happy to entertain any questions 
and comments while at the conference, where I'll typically be found in 
TC 4.7 and 4.2 meetings. For course, I'm also open to questions and 
comments posted on BLDG-SIM, although my responses will be somewhat delayed.

Joe,

I love the idea. I hope you can get the funding. Funding is an issue: the
open source software user often is part of a company. However, getting the
finance department to fund open source can be impossible! 

My view is: We need good software in the public domain, but I still want the
guy who's writing it to be able to afford his mortgage!

There could be some mechanisms to achieve funding through a consortium.
However, I believe a certain degree of control over source code is needed
that favours stakeholders otherwise finance depts just won't buy it.

As a company, Equa, the authors of IDA ICE appear to have a healthy approach
to open source. ICE is proprietary (closed) but it makes use of the modelica
open source physics language and its

For those unacquainted with Open Source, one of our comedians - Stephen Fry

What kind of open source license would this project utilize?  GPL or 
similar?  You might have a better chance getting others involved if they 
were assured that their contributions were always passed along under the 
same license and that no person or company can grab all the hard work 
you've done and use it as the core for their commercial product.

Don't know yet. The first thing is to get LBNL to formally relinquish 
its intellectual lock on the source code, which they've said they're 
willing to do for years.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] do I have to model cooling and heating in this case?
Message-ID: <116079.14741.qm@web111405.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hi All,
Was hoping you all could check my thinking regarding how to model the following.  

The project is a LEED NCv3/2009 energy model.  The project is a large warehouse with some support spaces (offices, toilets, lunch room, security etc).  It is located in Medellin, Columbia.  Medellin has a very mild climate.  It is apparently common for buildings in this location to not be provided with heating or cooling.   In keeping with that, most spaces on this project will not be heated or cooled and satisfy the ASHRAE 90.1-2007 definition for UNconditioned spaces.  (A few of the UNconditioned spaces even have permanently open, fixed louvers and could potentially meet the ASHRAE 90.1-2007 definition for unenclosed spaces).  

Appendix G, Table G3.1, 1. Design Model, item b. states: All CONDITIONED spaces in the proposed design shall be simulated as being both heated and cooled even if no heating or cooling system is to be installed.......

My Modeling Plan: 
Since the above statement is for CONDITIONED spaces, my plan is to model the UNconditioned spaces as neither heated nor cooled in both the proposed and baseline models.  I intend to only model the lighting and process energy in these spaces.  For the few cooled spaces on the project, I intend to model both heating and cooling in both the proposed and baseline models even though the spaces will actually only have cooling.  

Potential Issues:
The only point of confusion or difficulty I see with my plan is that Table G3.1, 4. Schedules, Exception a, and 10. HVAC Systems could potentially create the impression that every space has to be simulated as heated and cooled.  However, with further careful reading, it seems to me that the intent of sections 4 & 6 is to provide details for but not change the scope of section 1 which establishes the extent of spaces that have to be modeled as heated and cooled.  

Natural Ventilation Credit?
Also, am I missing an opportunity here to get credit for natural ventilation in these spaces?  Although, does providing someone with say an operable window really count as a natural ventilation system?  That doesn't seem quite right to me in terms of getting LEED credit for energy savings.  While the spaces have been designed to satisfy the natural ventilation requirements with respect to ASHRAE 62/LEED IEQ purposes, they haven't been "engineered" for natural ventilation from a comfort standpoint.  

I would appreciate feedback regarding the correctness my thinking and modeling plan above. 
Thank you for reading this far. Thanks in advance for your feedback.  
Julia

I had a related/similar question.  

I thought DOE2.2 was already open source since it's paid for via public funds.  I also thought that DOE2.2 picked up where DOE2.1E left off and already added several enhancements.

Question: Can COSBES work with DOE2.2 and further improve it, versus starting back where DOE2.1E left off?

Maybe you're already planning to do that, don't know.  It would seem a good idea to have one consolidated version of DOE2 with all enhancements added since DOE2.1E final release.

Any clarification you can provide will be appreciated.

Several of us out here always excited to hear of potential improvements to eQuest/DOE2.2 to help us with our projects.

Thanks! :)

Julia,

In response to your natural ventilation issue:  The user manual for 
ASHRAE 90.1 states "The proposed building default cooling system does 
not exclude natural ventilation from consideration. It just means that 
the proposed building is modeled as a "hybrid system" where cooling is 
provided by natural ventilation when conditions are acceptable and by 
the default mechanical cooling system when natural ventilation is 
inadequate to provide thermal comfort."  From this, I would imagine that 
you should model your regularly occupied spaces as conditioned with this 
so-called hybrid system, rather than unconditioned, as i understand from 
your modeling plan.  (by regularly occupied spaces, I mean offices and 
conference rooms are conditioned and storage is NOT conditioned)  
Technically, if your spaces are "sufficiently" ventilated naturally, 
there would be little to no hours in which the mechanical half of the 
hybrid system turns on.

If you are using equest, you might need to supplement your model with 
separate comfort analyses of the naturally ventilated spaces and then 
work in those results in the form of schedules.

BLCC is useful for USA life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) calculations as uses USA energy price escalation rates, emissions, and discount rates. Is anyone aware of a program that uses Euro-based escalation rates, emissions, and discount rates that could be used with LCCA for ECMs in Euro-based countries?

Julia,

You are correct that if the spaces are neither heated or cooled, there
is no need to model heating or cooling systems in either the proposed or
baseline models. Reference: The paragraph "HVAC System Types" in the
link below: 
https://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=3198

For the cooling-only spaces, they should be modeled with both cooling
and heating systems. Use "electric and other" heating source
classification for baseline model per Notes #2 under Table G3.1.1A in
ASHRAE 90.1 2007. The proposed model needs to have electric heating as
well per Table G3.1 No. 10.

Julia,

In response to your natural ventilation issue:  The user manual for 
ASHRAE 90.1 states "The proposed building default cooling system does 
not exclude natural ventilation from consideration. It just means that 
the proposed building is modeled as a "hybrid system" where cooling is 
provided by natural ventilation when conditions are acceptable and by 
the default mechanical cooling system when natural ventilation is 
inadequate to provide thermal comfort."  From this, I would imagine that

you should model your regularly occupied spaces as conditioned with this

so-called hybrid system, rather than unconditioned, as i understand from

your modeling plan.  (by regularly occupied spaces, I mean offices and 
conference rooms are conditioned and storage is NOT conditioned)  
Technically, if your spaces are "sufficiently" ventilated naturally, 
there would be little to no hours in which the mechanical half of the 
hybrid system turns on.

If you are using equest, you might need to supplement your model with 
separate comfort analyses of the naturally ventilated spaces and then 
work in those results in the form of schedules.

BLCC is useful for USA life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) calculations as
uses USA energy price escalation rates, emissions, and discount rates.
Is anyone aware of a program that uses Euro-based escalation rates,
emissions, and discount rates that could be used with LCCA for ECMs in
Euro-based countries?

Dear All,

I'm looking for the weather file (*.epw or *.wea format) of Jakarta, Indonesia. I am surprised as even the EnergyPlus weather data site doesn't seem to have any data for Indonesia!   Any help is really appreciated.

Sincerely,

Hi All,



Appendix G3.1.2.9 of ASHRAE 90.1-2007 gives the formula for systems 1
& 2:Pfan = CFMs x 0.3where CFMs is the supply fan airflow rate in
cfm and Pfan is in watts. I just noticed that in SI version, the
formula is the same Pfan = CFMs x 0.3 where Pfan is also in watts but
CFMs is in lps. Which is version correct? I have already looked into the erratas and addendum but did not find any corrections.


Thank you all in advance.


Jaigath Chandraprakash

Yes, it appears to be part of the SI edition that hasn't been fully
converted from IP.

For System 7 (I haven't done a system 1 or 2), I used the SI calc and found
that it matched the fan power of a VAV system in E+ with 1300Pa pressure
drop and about 70% fan efficiency. You just have to do half of the calc in
IP units!

Hi there,

RMI is currently hiring for a Building Energy Consulant - please see
description and details below.

Thanks,
Caroline Fluhrer

*
Building Energy Consultant*
Rocky Mountain Institute is an independent, entrepreneurial nonprofit
think-and-do tank? that drives the efficient and restorative use of
resources. Established in 1982 by Amory and Hunter Lovins, what began as a
small group of colleagues focusing on energy solutions has since grown into
a broad-based Institute with approximately 90 full-time staff, an annual
budget of nearly $15 million, and a global reach. RMI is engaged in research
that addresses pragmatic designs, practices, and policies, not social
theories or laboratory experiments. We work on all parts of the solution
process?idea, strategy, and implementation?in the high impact areas of
energy, mobility and vehicle efficiency, energy resource use, security, and
the built environment.

Our building sector consultants work directly with engineers, architects,
and other real-estate professionals to integrate resource-efficient and
environmentally responsive design into specific projects. RMI's work on
hundreds of successful buildings of different types in different climates
dispels the notion that increasing energy efficiency or taking steps to

Hi All,
FYI the link below is great source for international weather data.  The service and software was new to me - so, I thought I'd pass it along in case others were unfamiliar with the company as well.  

They sell weather creation software that can be used to create weather data for any location in the world - yes, ANY location. The weather data file can be created in various formats such as TMY, TM2 and others for direct use in the energy or other modeling software you are using.  The software is around $600.  Or, they can create a single weather file for a particular requested location and email it to you for around $80.  I used this latter service.  I requested it in the evening and had it the next morning!

Happy modeling.

Message-ID: <012301caa03b$28ef0c70$7acd2550$@com>

Hi,

 

I know this topic has been discussed time and again on this forum, but I was
just hoping if someone can point me to an actual study or measured data that
shows the percentage utilization of garage ventilation fans with CO sensors
as compared to a baseline system with continuous fan operation during hours
of occupancy and no CO sensors.

There are various assumptions people take for number of hours the fans would
operate, ranging from 10% reduction in fan hours operation to  a 75%
reduction in the design case with CO sensors.

My question is , if there any measured data or study for typical large
garages serving high-rise buildings that use CO sensors and how many hours
those fans run/day?

 

Any lead/info in this direction would be really helpful.

 

Thanks,

Neetu

While Meteonorm is a great product, users should be aware that it's 
synthetic data generated by a computer program that extrapolates hourly 
data from statistical data for a location, or if even the statistical 
data are unavailable, interpolates from nearby locations

I'd also want to mention that ASHRAE will likely be releasing sometime 
this year a large data set of IWEC2 weather files for over 3,000 
international locations.

Message-ID: <69a9bc0a1001281420h69898d85v1dec522b3771ec5c@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I'm learning to use Daysim.  I currently have Autocad 2007 and the free
version of Google Sketchup on my computer.  I'd like to be able to use
Sketchup to create the 3D geometry for importing into Daysim, but I can't
export to 3ds.  Autocad 2007 doesn't export either.

I tried downloading the 3DsExport for Sketchup plugin, but it doesn't seem
to handle the materials files well enough for an import to Daysim.

I'd appreciate if anyone can let me know their methods for using some
combination of this software.

Thanks,

Hi Karen,

I used to use Radiance extensively and I have exported SketchUp files for use in Daysim once or twice.  It's been a while so I don't remember exactly how I did it. I believe that I used the SketchUp2Radiance converter to export building geometry from SketchUp to a Radiance format. http://code.google.com/p/su2rad/wiki/Su2radIntro

As I recall there was a lot of difficulty with this process. I would recommend simplifying the SU model as much as possible. Things like curves and sphere do not translate well also.

I also found that anytime I used Radiance/Daysim I would manually edit the materials file to ensure that everything was as it should be.  Ideally you should have a very limited number of materials (for simplicity) and this shouldn't be too complicated.

I hope this helps.

Regards,
Alex Krickx

Good point.  Thanks for pointing that out.  My understanding is that they use actual weather data from weather stations where they exist.  So, if you happen to need weather data for one of those sites, then you are getting actual weather data.   If you request an "in between" site, then they interpolate via triangulation to get that weather data.  However, they appear to be able to take into account specific details of your site such as elevation, landscape, etc if you have that info.

My first steps are simply to maintain an open-source version of DOE-2.1E. DOE-2.1E has been effectively abandoned by LBNL and DOE for close to a decade. I have assurances from LBNL that it's only a matter of paperwork for them to make the program open source, and have communicated to them my intentions without receiving any objections.

That would of course depend on the public's (your) interest and need, which is one reason for this announcement! But for starters, I have a backlog of completed work that have never been incorporated into the public release version of DOE-2.1E, such as two-dimensional and combined response factors for composite walls, a decent foundation model, and an improved weather file format.  In addition, I'm currently working on contract for ORNL to incorporate AtticSim into 2.1E. Lastly, I have a license from LBNL to continue working on my last major work there - a partially-completed DOE-2 to EnergyPlus translator (doe2ep) that, funding pending, can be updated to the current EnergyPlus release. Also in the works and soon to be launched are (1)  VisualEPlus, a graphical user interface for EnergyPlus done by colleagues in China, and (2) actual-year weather data
 service accessing NCDC's massive International Surface Hourly (ISH) data base.

However, I would be happy to entertain any questions and comments while at the conference, where I'll typically be found in TC 4.7 and 4.2 meetings. For course, I'm also open to questions and comments posted on BLDG-SIM, although my responses will be somewhat delayed.

It's been pointed out that my reply below was inserted into the wrong email chain.  This is the chain I meant to put it in. Hopefully, it will make more sense now.
Apologies, I'm going back to get another cup of coffee now.

Good point.  Thanks for pointing that out.  My understanding is that they use actual weather data from weather stations where they exist.  So, if you happen to need weather data for one of
those sites, then you are getting actual weather data.   If you request
an "in between" site, then they interpolate via triangulation to get
that weather data.  However, they appear to be able to take into
account specific details of your site such as elevation, landscape, etc
if you have that info.

While Meteonorm is a great product, users should be aware that it's synthetic data generated by a computer program that extrapolates hourly data from statistical data for a location, or if even the statistical data are unavailable, interpolates from nearby locations

I'd also want to mention that ASHRAE will likely be releasing sometime this year a large data set of IWEC2 weather files for over 3,000 international locations.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Unconditioned Rooms
Message-ID: <41363.52423.qm@web113105.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hello Everyone,

I am simulating an office building using a DX system. There are rooms like storage rooms, electrical  rooms with only exhaust fans, and stairs that have no cooling and heating. Since Appendix G requires me to model both heating and cooling identical to baseline (which is System 8). The proposed design will have  a DX and chilled water system. Is that correct? Or should I just include these rooms with DX AC? Or should I just not simulate these rooms.

These rooms are less than 5% of the total area and Im not sure if I should add a chilled water system to add cooling and heating to these areas. Need some advice on these. Thanks.

Regards,

Jaigath Chandraprakash

Karen.

I have updated su2rad in September last year to make it easier
for DAYSIM users to export geometry. There is a new "daysim"
export mode now which will create the geometry in a format that
DAYSIM expects. You still have to set the sky manually (for now)
and materials have to be converted (DAYSIM only allows shades
of grey) but that is done by DAYSIM automatically.

I am working on more features for DAYSIM and Radiance but
I can't tell when a new release will be ready.

You can find the "daysim" release of su2rad here:

http://su2rad.googlecode.com/files/su2rad_daysim_r03.zip

Cheers,
Thomas

Actual data means actual statistical data, i.e., monthly climate norms, 
not actual hourly data.  When you get a hourly weather file from 
MeteoNorm, all the values are derived.

Bob,

This will not entirely cover what you want, but it may give you a good start.  DOE has published benchmark energy models and results for 16 different types of commercial buildings in 16 ASHRAE 90.1-2004 climate zones here:

http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/commercial_initiative/new_construction.html

If you prefer not to dive into the energy models themselves, you can get most of what you would need to know about them in the "scorecard" spreadsheets.  Each scorecard lists the inputs and results for one particular building type across all the climate zones.  Tip - to get the scorecard files, you will need to download the zip files by building type, not climate zone.  It looks like Alaska has climate zones 7 and 8.  Climate zone 7 was simulated using the TMY2 Duluth, MN weather file, and climate zone 8 was simulated using the TMY2 Fairbanks, AK weather file.

These are considered to be baseline/benchmark buildings representative of a particular commercial building type.  They may help you by:


?         Showing the difference in energy consumption in climates 7 and 8 versus the other climate zones - both total and broken down by end-use and fuel type

?         Showing how the above changes depending on building type

?         Showing the variation in auto-sized equipment between climate zones and building types

One big caveat - for a more apples-to-apples comparison, system types were not varied across climate zones according to local practices.  If you want to know what system types are more common in Alaska vs. another region, these models will not provide you with that information.  They are simulations intended to represent average (new construction) buildings, but not any one particular real building.

To get more of a statistical representation of what's out there, you might try the CBECS dataset:

http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cbecs/

Good luck!

Yes runs fine on my little HP laptop with Windoze 7 which I have today  
is an improvement on that Vista rubbish k managed to avoid whilst  
watching others struggle.  Early teething problems were sorted.

I would recommend turning off the ask to confirm with me before I set  
anything setting. Can't remember what it's called but basically gives  
you full admin rights and you don't have to continually confirm when  
you want to do anything like change a driver setting etc.

Cheers

Hello All,

 

Does anyone have any idea which software has the capability of modeling a cold storage (-30 F) for energy analysis?

 

I talked to customer support of Trace 700 and came to know it does not have that capability.

 

Thanks,

Hey Kristin,

Thanks for the link and caveats.  Any idea how these things were calibrated?

Bob,

 

This will not entirely cover what you want, but it may give you a good start.  DOE has published benchmark energy models and results for 16 different types of commercial buildings in 16 ASHRAE 90.1-2004 climate zones here:

 

http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/commercial_initiative/new_construction.html

 

If you prefer not to dive into the energy models themselves, you can get most of what you would need to know about them in the "scorecard" spreadsheets.  Each scorecard lists the inputs and results for one particular building type across all the climate zones.  Tip - to get the scorecard files, you will need to download the zip files by building type, not climate zone.  It looks like Alaska has climate zones 7 and 8.  Climate zone 7 was simulated using the TMY2 Duluth, MN weather file, and climate zone 8 was simulated using the TMY2 Fairbanks, AK weather file.

 

These are considered to be baseline/benchmark buildings representative of a particular commercial building type.  They may help you by:

 

?         Showing the difference in energy consumption in climates 7 and 8 versus the other climate zones - both total and broken down by end-use and fuel type

?         Showing how the above changes depending on building type

?         Showing the variation in auto-sized equipment between climate zones and building types

 

One big caveat - for a more apples-to-apples comparison, system types were not varied across climate zones according to local practices.  If you want to know what system types are more common in Alaska vs. another region, these models will not provide you with that information.  They are simulations intended to represent average (new construction) buildings, but not any one particular real building.

 

To get more of a statistical representation of what's out there, you might try the CBECS dataset:

 

http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cbecs/

 

Good luck!

You're welcome!

There were different EUI metrics we measured the models against to make sure the results seemed reasonable (related to CBECS statistics, industry rules of thumb, or DOE's Advanced Energy Design Guides).  Since these are public, some people have given suggestions that we have incorporated - ranging from random enthusiasts to ASHRAE committee members to inter-lab collaboration to design professionals in the field relating to certain building types.  The models get updated on approximately the same schedule as E+ software (twice annually), so that gives DOE a chance to continually improve them.  Of course, there is a range of what could be considered correct since these models don't represent specific buildings and, therefore, wouldn't be calibrated against specific utility data.

Let me know if that didn't answer your question.

Hey Kristin,
Thanks for the link and caveats.  Any idea how these things were calibrated?

Bob,

This will not entirely cover what you want, but it may give you a good start.  DOE has published benchmark energy models and results for 16 different types of commercial buildings in 16 ASHRAE 90.1-2004 climate zones here:

http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/commercial_initiative/new_construction.html

If you prefer not to dive into the energy models themselves, you can get most of what you would need to know about them in the "scorecard" spreadsheets.  Each scorecard lists the inputs and results for one particular building type across all the climate zones.  Tip - to get the scorecard files, you will need to download the zip files by building type, not climate zone.  It looks like Alaska has climate zones 7 and 8.  Climate zone 7 was simulated using the TMY2 Duluth, MN weather file, and climate zone 8 was simulated using the TMY2 Fairbanks, AK weather file.

These are considered to be baseline/benchmark buildings representative of a particular commercial building type.  They may help you by:


*         Showing the difference in energy consumption in climates 7 and 8 versus the other climate zones - both total and broken down by end-use and fuel type

*         Showing how the above changes depending on building type

*         Showing the variation in auto-sized equipment between climate zones and building types

One big caveat - for a more apples-to-apples comparison, system types were not varied across climate zones according to local practices.  If you want to know what system types are more common in Alaska vs. another region, these models will not provide you with that information.  They are simulations intended to represent average (new construction) buildings, but not any one particular real building.

To get more of a statistical representation of what's out there, you might try the CBECS dataset:

http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cbecs/

Good luck!

Hello all.  I am looking for baseline information on commercial building energy use, construction and technologies for Alaska.

If you are aware of any such studies, I would be very grateful if you can tell me where to find them.

Thanks in advance for your assistance!

Hello Brian,

Please find attached some useful info about Energy Modelling Tools for
early stage design this will help you to highlights the advantages and
disadvantages of different softwares, Including Ecotect, TAS, GBS...Etc...
(Note: The report is back to 2005 or 04, therefore a few features are
changes, such as import/export capabilities which Ecotec really improve
from previous versions)
Hope this will help?.

Bldg-sim subscribers,
I am interested in learning about your experiences with Ecotect.  I am
particularly interested in learning about its relative strengths and
weaknesses as a schematic design tool.  Our firm is in the process of
integrating it more fully into our design process and while I?m sure we
will learn by experience it would be helpful to hear some ?war stories?
from others.  I would also like to hear about your relative reliance on
Ecotect versus other modeling tools in the early stages of design.
