Subject: [BLDG-SIM] DOE-2 inside film resistances
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F199907281228.AA283071MD62521@gard.com>

Re: Jeff Hirsch's comments below on varying inside film resistances.
I would discourage anyone from trying to do this with DOE-2. The
reason is that in calculating loads, DOE-2 uses weighting factors
that are precalculated at a FIXED (but user specifiable using
the INSIDE-FILM-RES keyword) combined inside film resistance for
each zone surface (but different surfaces can have different fixed
film resistances). So if you manage to change the inside film
resistances in the hourly calculation your conductive heat transfer
will be incompatible with the weighting factors and your results
will be highly suspicious.

If you do not want to bother looking at the source, manuals,
and papers, Fred Winkelmann is the definitive source for this
kind of information on the DOE-2 LOADS calculation
(FCWinkelmann at lbl.gov), but here is my quick summary
(see comments embedded below ...)

Yes.  Form factors are calculated by default for sky/ground "seen" and
the tilt is also used in solar and outside film coefficient calculations hourly.

Inside film coefficient is set, based upon tilt for exterior walls and a
constant
of .68 for windows -interior and exterior- and interior walls, and does not vary

hourly unless you explicitly specify and hourly variation (easily - but
cumbersome
- to do with a schedule for windows, and much more difficult - using functions,
and thus really impractical for most all users to consider trying - for walls.)

For 2.1E the tilt range is 0-180; for 2.2 it is -180 to 180.

>     b. Curved walls?

No.  You need to break them into planar sufraces.  In 2.1e these are
rectangular; in 2.2 these can be up to 30 sided polygons and can be
automatically generated once you "draw" the space outline on which
you want the walls placed.

Same as comment above for wall tilt.

Hello again,

sorry for the prvious message that lost its body for
some mysterious reason... here it is again:

TRNSYS user Alain Cordier (Toulouse, France) has implemented thermal
comfort
calculations within a modified Type 56 (multi-zone building model).

This improvement allows the output of:

   PMV (Predicted Mean Vote)

        PPD (Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied) and
        PPS (Predicted Percentage of Satisfied).

See
http://evl.cstb.fr/francais/projets/IISiBat/TRNSYS/trnsys14.htm
for details.

The team at university of Toulouse has also developped a detailed model
of the
human body (MARCL). The french version of an article describing this can

be downloaded from the WEB site of IBPSA France:

Hope this helps,

Werner

Dear Group

Well, it was a long road, but I was finally able to track down the data as
well as other useful information.  For future reference, I thought I would
summarize my search results for the group:

1) There are two sources of the ASCII files:
   a) Jeff Hirsch (Jeff.Hirsch at DOE-2.com, http://DOE2.com
   b) IES Ltd. (contact Ian Molloy => ian at ies4d.com or http://www.ies4d.com

NOTE: These ASCII files are not in typical NOAA format and still need a
substantial amount of work to be able to read and convert them into DOE-2
BIN files.

2) Per an email from a John Fullwood (jfullwood at meto.gov.uk), the CISBE is
currently rewriting their guide to weather and solar data and, in conjuction
with this, a new series of weather datasets for design applications is being
produced.  These datasets will become available either from CIBSE or John's
office (phone is 44-1344-854673) at a special low price but not until early
next year.

A special thanks to Jim Pegues for the initial lead on this data, as well as
to all others for their help!

Sincerely,

Bob Ramirez

I agree with Dave Walker, the programs with GUI's are useful tools - like any tool they can be misused, but so can the
text-based DOE2 programs.  It's easy for a beginner to rely on defaults no matter what the program is.  A GUI based
program, such as PowerDOE can assist in making sure the geometry is correct (a major stumbling block to new users), and
the on-line help is easier than sifting through the manuals.  The one thing I like about PowerDOE is that it is fully
functional (all the DOE2.2 commands are available)- not all GUI based DOE2 programs are fully functional.  The
spreadsheet feature of PowerDOE is also an excellent way of checking through input data.  The other important feature
of PowerDOE is that it creates a BDL input file that is transpotrable - it can be modified outside PowerDOE (using a
text editor) and later modified using PowerDOE.

I've been using DOE2 since it started out as CAL-ERDA, and even though I have no problem with the BDL input language, I
find I'm using PowerDOE exclusively.

Over the years, I've found new users creating poor models because they did not spend the time to understand the input
and default values, they messed up on the geometry, and - most important - they did not understand the mechanical
systems they were trying to model.

I have to disagree with John Karasaki and Bill Koran when it comes to
GUI's.  I used DOE 2.1e for several years and currently use PowerDOE.  I
find the GUI with PowerDOE helpful in preventing acceptance of default
values. While using DOE 2.1e, I spent hours looking through manuals
trying to determine exactly what default values were being used.  There
were times when defaults were affecting my simulations and I had no idea
they even existed until I got unreasonable results.  PowerDOE includes
inputs for all variables available in DOE 2.2 and the default values can
be readily seen or called up on the screen.  Coupled with the on-line
help, understanding the significance of each value and inputting correct
values is much easier and quicker than with a text based version. 
Granted, you will have to review the screens to determine what defaults
relate to your systems, but the time required is minimized.  I believe
my simulations have improved significantly since I started using
PowerDOE.

The 3D visualization of the structure also is a great help for me.  I am
an engineer, but I must be geometrically impaired. I have a difficult
time getting roof overhangs and shading correct without being able to
see a representation of the structure on the screen.  

I have also been impressed with response time from JJ Hirsh.  They
actually answer questions and corrected a small bug that I found within
three weeks.  They have a trial period and a reasonable price.  I would
recommend PowerDOE to anyone, first time user or veteran.  I haven't
used the other version, so I can't really tell you much about them.

I wholeheartedly concur with John Karasaki's comments, although I have had no 
opportunity to use DOE-2 for several years now, and so have little experience 
with graphical versions.

I have seen serious flaws even in DOE-2 models created without using a GUI 
version. I believe it is a certainty that the greater tendency to be 
satisfied with defaults, as well as the typically decreased understanding of 
what the program is actually doing, means that using a GUI version will often 
result in a less appropriate simulation.

A careful modeler can certainly create a good model with a text-based or a 
GUI-based version, but being forced to input nearly everything really helps 
with long-term understanding.  A think the keys to simulation, with any model 
(including spreadsheet models) are (1) extreme care, and (2) question 
everything to the point of paranoia.  Since most project timelines don't 
allow this, there are a lot of mediocre-to-poor models out there!  (Although 
I hope not from the readers of this list!<g>)

First time user or not, you should start with the current version of DOE-2,
DOE-2.2.  Using any other version would be a waste of time.  DOE-2.2 is
significantly different than the earlier versions.

One of the DOE-2.2 vendors had a great quote: "DOE-2.2 is deceivingly
similar to DOE-2.1E."  What he meant was that you can use 2.2 just like
2.1E.  However, doing so prevents one from using the full potential of 2.2.

I would avoid any of the programs with a graphical interface (PowerDOE,
VisualDOE, etc.) because it is too easy to make mistakes that go un-noticed
and learn bad habits.  Regardless of what their marketing literature says,
these interface tools should only be used in the hands of experienced
modelers.  I'm sure I will get alot of heat for that statement, but I have
seen a few studies done with those tools that had real flaws buried in the
input files.

As you do your first input files, you should have some experienced DOE-2
modelers review the files.  You should also allow yourself a huge amount of
time to complete any project.

HTH.

I have just started searching the internet to obtain DOE-2 software.  There
is allot of information out there.

Can anyone advise me on which version of DOE-2 and add-on software would be
best to obtain for a first time user.

 (I am familiar with ASEAM 5.0, BLCC, and ERATES).

Thankyou

Bob,
     
In the late 1980s a task group for the Chartered Institute of Building Service 
Engineers (CIBSE) in the UK assembled example weather years for 15 sites in the 
UK to be used for building simulation work.  While the weather data files are 
not in the exact format of a NOAA TMY file or a DOE-2 BIN file, I believe the 
files have all the required data elements needed by DOE-2 (temperature, 
humidity, 2 components of solar radiation, wind speed and direction).  All that 
would be needed is to write some software to convert the data format to one 
DOE-2 can read.
     
The 15 cities in the CIBSE Example Year data set are:
     
Scotland
  Glasgow
  Aberdeen, Scotland
  Dundee, Scotland
  Eskdalemuir, Scotland
Northern Ireland
  Aldergrove
Wales
  Aberporth
England
  Newcastle
  Manchester
  Birmingham
  Norwich
  Bristol
  Heathrow
  London - Kew
  London - Heathrow Airport
  Camborne
  
The big question is how do you get this data.  At one point in the early 1990s 
disks were being sold by a company named Facet Ltd.  Its address is:

Facet Ltd.
Marlborough House
Upper Marlborough Road
St. Albans
Hertfordshire
England

But I don't have a phone, fax or e-mail contact for them.  Perhaps one of the 
BLDG-SIM subscribers in the UK can provide these if Facet is still the vendor 
for the data.

Best Regards,
