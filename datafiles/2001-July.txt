Robert,

It isn't exctly in WYEC2 format but NREL has for free download  TMY2 hourly "typical metereological year" climate files for 239 cities in the US and its territories.  Go to http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/tmy2/ for more information.

Hello,

I am looking for weather files for energy simulation in WYEC2 format for the
following US cities:

Los Angeles
Denver 
Honalulu
Chicago
New York City
Charlotte 
Philadelphia
Houston
Hartford

ASHRAE has WYEC2 weather data for some of these cities only. Does anyone
know of another source I may turn to for this information?

Thank you in advance.

I am trying to simulate a heat-recovery system in DOE2.1. 

If I choose a SZRH system with 65% heat-recovery, I get the expected mixed
air temperature values:
-9?F outside air
72?F return air
64?F mixed air

If I then replace the SZRH with a RHFS, the heat-recovery then doesn't seem
to work:
-9?F outside air
72?F return air
51?F mixed air

Can anyone help explain this anomaly?

Hello, I I have been looking for TMY weather data for Raanana, a
Mediterranean coastal City near Tel Aviv, Israel for quite some time without
much luck.  The only lead I do have is to use the Meteonorm software which
gives output in various format.  Could you provide me with any other Leads?
Any thought on the Meteonorm Software?

I thank you in advance for your help.

I agree with both of you that the approval of new members might be doable,
but that the full moderation is not the best route.  Most of these lists
don't get spammed on a regular basis.  And if you fully moderate it you have
the possibility of censorship.

I haven't found the list to be burdened with unnecessary messages, so I
don't think this one incident requires a fully moderated forum.  

I second Abhijeet's suggestion as a prudent and minimal response.  If Jason
feels that even this would be a burden (he is, after all, offering the

leaving everything as it is until such time as the number of these spam

Rather than manually scanning each mail.. it might be easier just to approve
new members through a moderator. That way pranksters would find it more
difficult to get through. (also I think, having a screen to enter the list
itself will act as a damper on the casual prankster like the one today)

Not a virus but simply (rude) junk mail.  The person who 
sent it subscribed to the mailing list, sent the 
advertisement, and unsubscribed all in the span of a few 
minutes.  I can't think of any way to avoid this problem 
other than act as a moderator for the list.  That would be 
a manual approval of all e-mails sent to the list prior to 
them being posted.  I would rather not do that unless it 
becomes more of a problem.  Opinions?

List members, 

I received many suggestions on how to deal with junk mail 
sent to the list.  Overall, most people thought that given 
the small problem that it has been to date, I shouldn't 
take the step to moderate the list.  People had many good 
suggestions for other approaches but most I could not 
implement with my current mailing list software.  

One thing that I have decided to do is require 
authentication when subscribing.  Basically, when 
subscribing people will now get an e-mail asking them to 
reply to the e-mail to subscribe.  It is one way of making 
sure the e-mail address is authentic.  Perhaps this will 
discourage people who send junk e-mails since some of those 
people use faked e-mail addresses.  For the rest of us it 
is one small step that shouldn't be too inconvenient. 

Another thing that a few people brought up is virus 
protection.  We have software that checks every e-mail 
message going in or out of GARD, including to the mailing 
lists, for viruses.  In addition, this program is set up to 
not allow any attachments that are executables (exe, bat, 
vbs, etc..).   The virus prevention library is updated 
automatically several times each everyday.  That said, 
their are no guarantees but we are trying to do a good job.

Now, doesn't anyone have a question about some arcane DOE-2 
keyword?

Would anyone like to try out my new FREEWARE program to generate bin 
temperature data from TMY2 data?  I'm looking for feedback on ways to 
make it more useful.  Download the self extracting zip file by entering this 
URL:  

   http://www.hvacware.net/tmy2bin.exe 

There is no link from my site to this program.  You must type the above 
URL to start the download. 

This program converts TMY2 weather files to bin weather data for quick 
energy calulations.  It considers the dry bulb temperature only. And 
currently, only US imperial units. Your can choose to create 2 degree, 4 
degree, 5 degree, or 10 degree temperature bins.  

TMY2 weather data files are available for free on the Internet.  See the 
README.TXT file for details. 

This program is written in Visual Basic 6.  If you would like the VB6 source 
code, or you have suggestions, email me at:   

   randy at hvacware.net 


Here is a sample output .csv file from TMY2BIN: 

"SPOKANE, WA"

I agree with you, Jason. A manual approval is not yet preferable.
Junk e-mails are a problem, but let's hope that these intrusions
will be scarce.

Rather than manually scanning each mail.. it might be easier just to approve
new members through a moderator. That way pranksters would find it more
difficult to get through. (also I think, having a screen to enter the list
itself will act as a damper on the casual prankster like the one today)
Any thoughts?

Not a virus but simply (rude) junk mail.  The person who 
sent it subscribed to the mailing list, sent the 
advertisement, and unsubscribed all in the span of a few 
minutes.  I can't think of any way to avoid this problem 
other than act as a moderator for the list.  That would be 
a manual approval of all e-mails sent to the list prior to 
them being posted.  I would rather not do that unless it 
becomes more of a problem.  Opinions?

Hello Group

In preparation for potential work in Australia, we are looking into
available information/reference sources that might be utilized for doing
commercial building simulations.  Would anyone know:
 
1) If there is an Australian equivalent of the U.S. Commercial Buildings
Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS)?

2) If there is an Australian equivalent of the National Climactic Data
Center (NCDC) from which to get average and/or actual year weather data that
is of sufficient quality to be used for DOE-2?  I already know about the
Australian weather data on the DOE2.com website.

Any leads on this information would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!

IWEC are not the same as TMY2--they were
based on the TMY2 format but contain more
information (and are Y2K compliant unlike TMY2).
Thus, the weather packers will have to be
modified to deal with the new format.

IWEC has not be released by ASHRAE yet.
It is expected to be available later this month
or in August.

I am trying to pack some IWEC format (which use TMY2 formatting) weather
files for use with DOE2.1E (Acrosoft and J.J. Hirsch versions) and nothing
seems to be working. I am trying to pack the files using the TMY2 packing
method but nothing seems to give.

Can anyone tell me what I might be doing wrong or what I should keep in mind
when trying to pack these files?

Thank you.
