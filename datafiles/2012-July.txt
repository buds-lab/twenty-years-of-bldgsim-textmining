CanmetEnergy publishes a good residential energy analysis program.
http://canmetenergy.nrcan.gc.ca/software-tools/hot2000/84

Also Hot2XP, and Hot3000 - beta.

I have been using Hot2000 for years.  We did a major renovation on 
our home 3 years ago.  I used Hot2000 and DOE2.1e to model the 
house.  The two agreed on the envelope and ventilation 
loads.  Hot2000 gave results that seemed more reasonable for the 
total energy.  The house has an HRV and infloor heating, no 
AC.  Creating the Hot2000 model is significantly simpler.

With equest you can set the ventilation system to no heating/cooling 
capacity and a fan flow to account for the exhaust flow with no fan 
energy.  Allocating the plug loads and schedules will take some 
judgement.  The refrigerator is modelled as a plug load, not as 
refrigeration.  You need to account for any ventilation - kitchen 
hood, dryer, bathroom fans etc. in the appropriate zones.

The default schedules and loads in Hot2000 are fairly representative 
of typical homes.  You can create your own schedules as required.

Dear,

can anyone recommend some literature sources related to the research on and
simulation of solar assisted TABS in moderate climates.
The type of building is not specified, it is more like looking for the

Chris and All,

 

The idea behind SIMEB development (www.simeb.ca) is to provide a free tool that allow a fast DOE2.1, DOE2.2 and EnergyPlus model creation, with an emphasis on existing building :  assisted calibration tool, weather data access and clustering analysis.

 

Here are new features that will be available soon on our site :

?         All the documentations (including examples) will be provided in English. We are working on video tutorial also

?         A web-based application will allow creating SIMEB weather file  (*.swdf) by uploading the EnergyPlus (*.epw) or DOE2 (*.bin) files provided by the user. 

?         New version of SIMEB with migration from EnergyPlusV.5 to EnergyPlus V7.1

 

 

Thanks Chris for all the good words about SIMEB. 

Comments like that help us to push the development.

All:

 

On a related note - Thanks to Brian Fountain, a very intriguing (free) piece of energy simulation software called Sim-EB (available here: https://www.simeb.ca/) which focuses on modeling existing commercial buildings recently came to my attention. While quite powerful, the Sim-EB software provides a number of unique features that I think are appropriate to this discussion:

 

1)      Given 'monthly' utility consumption and demand, and user-defined input parameter constraints, Sim-EB provides an interface for supporting 'auto-calibration' of DOE2.1e models. 

2)      Given user defined building descriptions of elements common across the engines, (form, fabric, HVAC, controls, etc), provides a means for using either DOE2.1e, DOE2.2 or EnergyPlus to perform calculaitons

3)      Allows for easy import of user edited .inp files or .idf into the Sim-EB software.  These files could have been created elsewhere, and just use Sim-EB for calibration or analysis, results review, etc. 

4)      Has a user website (https://www.simeb.ca:8443/index_fr.jsp,) which automatically creates and emails to users a user defined hourly 'AMY' model files (for Quebec related cities) to support model calibration.

5)      Give a flexible, uniform data series (short term data logger data, 15 minute energy data, etc.), Sim-EB  provides a flexible clustering tool for observing 'day-type load profiles' from  within a larger data set. One can cluster model output as well, as Sim-EB provides a good visualization tool for comparing (day-type load profile) clusters of model output to clusters of metered data. 

 

#2) lets people see, even for a shoebox model, the differences in the loads/systems/plants between DOE2.1, DOE2.2 and EPlus  calculation methodologies. Of course, there are a great deal of 'switches' between the three different simulation engines that the software automatically sets, but one can export the input files and study the switch settings if they need to.

 

#5) above supports a case of real field data informing model input, i.e. the generation of hourly schedules given actual, real data!

, 

This software was created and is distributed by the good folks at Hydro Quebec. As such, it supports both English and Metric units and the menu trees can be switched between French and English (but the help is in French only). I've use the Google translator tool and the example files to learn how to use the tool successfully.  There are great pdf reports distributed along with the software which describe the clustering algorithms, the auto-calibration routines, etc.

 

Finally - if one renames the Sim-Eb   .swdf file format weather files with a  .zip extension, you can see how to replace them with non-Canadian files. It's a bit of a pain, but possible. 

 

While it is certainly no panacea, I personally think this tool is a demonstration of how simulation software could be used to 'marry' simulation input/output  with field data collection to provide 'better' calibrated simulations for examining retrofit potential. Recognizing the 'perfect is not the enemy of the good', this software, IMHO, forms a good compromise towards using energy models to create actionable results. 

 

All the Best,

 

_Chris

Jim,

Sorry if I came off as a little smug.  You've actually put in words the main reason why I think building energy modelers have steered away from using historical weather data, which is simply that of  convenience, i.e., there are a lot of "typical year" weather files floating around, but getting hold of 
a usable historical year weather file takes a little more work.

For the study that I mentioned, Dru and I did not have to do anything because the SANSOM data set,
available from NCDC, contained 25 years of historical weather files for 239 cities (same as TMY2s).

That was in 1996, and the availability of historical weather data has only increased exponentially since
then, although the building energy modeling community seems curiously to not have followed. 
The most notable change, in my view, is NCDC's decision to put the entire ISH (Integrated Surface Hourly) data online in 2005, and then to make it free to all in 2011.  This means that the raw weather reports
from major stations around the world ( ~ 1,500 in the US) are available stretching back to 1980. 

I've been working with the ISH for many years now, and am able to generate complete weather files from any ISH file within seconds, and have been providing that as a service to customers.  Sometime later this
year, I'll be rolling out something on the Web, but for now, those interested can just send me an e-mail.

The idea that the ISH is of questionable quality is, in my view, rather backwards.  The ISH is a repository of the weather reports by the "official" weather stations around the world, so if you can't trust that, what can you trust?

Dear Joe, 

No fair! You  and Dru have been at the forefront energy modeling research for most of my adult life, and have a big head start. 

My guess is that you spent a lot of time preparing the actual weather files for the research, however.  Unless I'm missing something, the ready availability of high quality (e.g., no big hunks of missing data) actual weather data has been pretty limited until recently.  With folk like Weather Analytics getting on board and making it pretty easy to get and inexpensive, it becomes a lot faster and lower cost than trying to clean some of the NOAA / NCDC data, not to mention getting good data for sites not in or near a major city. 

Kudos for being way ahead of the industry curve (at least my own curve)!  It's getting easier to catch up! 

p.s., Dru sent me that paper and I'll be reading it with interest very soon.

I've always thought it was a "no-brainer" to use actual weather data whenever you're comparing simulation results to actual consumption data.  Even with the earliest degree-day software such as 
PRISM (Princeton Scorekeeping Method) in the 1980's, it was stressed to use the degree days 
from the period of record, and not the long-term average, so I'm not sure why this (using actual
year weather data) is such a revelation.

The variation in total energy consumption of course depends a lot on the building characteristics.
Back in 1996, Dru Crawley and I wrote a paper on "Does it matter which weather data you use in energy simulations?", for the ACEEE Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings (it also appeared as two
separate ASHRAE papers at around the same time) where we took some prototypical building models (Dru did commercial, I did residential) and ran them with various "typical year" weather files and also 25 years of historical data in 10-12 US locations.

Dear Forums, 

I am busy preparing a short talk for the Fall ASHRAE Energy Modeling Conference.  The topic is "An Approach for Calibrating Existing Building Energy Models to their Utility Consumption". 

As part of the preparation, I will address the issue of how muc h difference might result in energy conservation measure savings predictions if you use actual weather data for the billing period versus TMY data.  

To get a rough idea  how much variation there might be, I looked at Degree Days for a span of years.  What a variation! (for the city I'm studying at least) 

I am not yet sure how that affects total energy consumption - you'll have to attend my presentation in Atlanta to find out J. 

In the meantime, I am starting to think that existing building energy models should use actual weather, not TMY data.  Have any of you run similar comparisons for existing building models?

Chris,

Since pitot tube is a single point sensor you will need some assumptions
regarding velocity distribution of flow through the window. You may need an
array of those tubes to get more or less realistic picture.
I know someone who was doing air velocity measurements in the room for his
research at Ryerson University.
He measured air flow variation against vertical position. Those sensors
were using hot wires to measure air velocity. Sorry I don't recall the
maker.
And again, the question remains: number of sensor vs the character of flow.

With those pitot tubes in the rocket science they face more simple problems
when they have controlled overall air flow in the wind tunnel.

In the building science, I believe, you want to know overall air flow based
on velocity distribution.  Inverse problems are tough.

When using a hood you may change the flow significantly.

Sorry if this wasn't helpful.

Hi Chris

I beleive you want to measure on a real window where the flow velocity 
will be low. Pitot tubes lose accuracy for very low velocities.

The issue of using a grid of measuring points applies for any kind of 
device because of the variability of the flow across the opening.

Hot wire anemometers are very good foy low velocities but they are 
sensitive to the  incoming flow direction. Maybe the best option will be 
the omnidirectional sensors (a sphere). They measure low velocities and 
are direction independent. Of course you can not obtain the flow 
direction from them. Airflow Instruments is a possibility.

A flow hood could be an option but it is unidirectional.

Hope this did not increase turbulence...

I would use a spinning fan blade anemometer, because that is all that I 
have!  You would have to make up your own grid and integrate the 
results.  But who is going to argue with you?

I would NOT use a flow hood or a pitot tube, even if I owned them.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] VRF in eQUEST
Message-ID: <006a01cd595f$cd99b420$68cd1c60$@eu>

Dear all,

 

I am trying to model a VRF system as Packaged Variable Volume Variable
Temperature system. 

 

My building has four external VRF units connected to terminal units for each
space in the interior. According to the power point presentation on the
subject, it should be modelled as PVVT with separate system for each zone.
In this case what values would you use? Would it be the same as my original
model or is there a way to define values with different proportions based on
the initial ones?

 

Wouldn?t it make more sense to design 4 PVVT as many as the VRF I have? And
in this case which is the zone controlling the system? If I ?m not wrong,
eQUEST only allows to choose one.

 

And one more general question: eQUEST creates by default plenum for each
space and HVAC systems with all zones. Would you remove these default HVAC
systems together with the unconditioned spaces and plenums?

 

Thank you very much.

 

Best regards,

 

Eleni

Thanks Ken and everyone.  It sounds like a big challenge.  As it is a 
spare time research project, I am going to keep expenses as low as possible.

One issue I realize will be a big problem is spot measuring all open 
windows at once - in the time it takes to move from a ground floor 
window to the second floor, the conditions can change significantly.

The windows have insect screens which may eliminate some of the cross 
currents outside the window.

Once I obtain the measuring instruments, I will be back for more advise.

Dear Chris and all

I had mentioned to Chris outside the forum (sorry should have copied all in) that it might be useful carrying out a tracer gas decay test. As many of you note the hot wire anenometer will not sense direction and the use of pitot tubes or a flow grid may not be suitable for such low pressure ranges. This is the reason that I suggest a decay method may be the best way to analyse the overall flow rate through the room. This is the way I measured flow rates in both model environments and test rooms when I did my PhD. The main reason for this is the unsteady nature of ventilation flows themselves. Ventilation by its nature is not unidirectional across an opening it is an unsteady I.e. varying and fluctuating pressure across the opening that if you measure it with a transducer will have positive and negative amplitude all the time. It is the differences in the combination of buoyancy and wind driven pressures around the building that cause a variance in the mean pressure differences that drive the flow in one or other direction overall. Obviously this combines with other factors such as opening position, size, etc. The tracer gas test will get around this unsteady issue as you are then looking at a time decay method that will give you the decay rate and therefore a direct relationship to the flow rate into a room. Fairly easy to test, a relevant gas sensor, datalogger (though many sensors now have them built in) and a can of trace gas like SF6 or preferably something less ozone depleting but easy to test for.

I recommend that anyone studying ventilation flow reads the book on ventilation theory and measurement by David Etheridge and Matts Sandberg. It is an invaluable resource and will answer many questions people may have regarding these sorts of studies.

Paul

Hey all,

I am looking at an energy plus based sim program and one of the major selling points would be doing the load calcs in the same program as the energy modeling. From what I have read, the heat balance method that E+ uses should be more accurate than the transfer function method that a widely used load calc program like HAP would use. However the results are different so I wanted to get people?s thoughts on the subject.

I did a test case, a 20 x 20 office space (384 ft conditioned area) with one southern facing window.

-          10 ft tall

-          4 People

-          1 W/ft2 Lighting

-          0.5 W/ft2 Equipment

-          ASHRAE Office default schedules

-          Basic Walls and Roof, ASHRAE minimum windows (U=.55,SHGC=.4)

-          Design Weather ? 95 db / 75 wb

I?m attaching some of the results, but overall the E+ calc has a lower peak load. Occupant, lighting and plug loads seem to follow their schedules. HAP looks like it very heavily weights the delayed load effect (TFM) even though I used a medium weight (70lb/ft2) wall (fyi - changing it to a lightweight wall has some but not a huge effect). HAP also ignores the slab heat loss in its cooling calculations. This shows up most clearly in the unoccupied zone temperature. In HAP the residual loads drive the temperature up to 82 where in the E+ calc the slab loss dominates, driving the temperature into the 60s. I could see leaving it out of the peak to be conservative but then allowing the unocc temperature to jump up overnight and having to deal with that load seems a bit too unrealistic. HAP also seems to over predict the peak roof conduction gain, probably due to the use of the sol-air temperatures, which I have read can over predict gains.

I tend to want to believe the E+ analysis because I know that it?s calculation methods are in general more rigorous but I am very interested what others may think, sim engines are known for being poor design load predictors (I?m looking at you eQuest) and HAP is a very established and trusted program.

Thanks in advance for anyone that feels like diving into this with me.

Dear Brendan,

Caveat emptor: I have not attempted this type of comparison, since my ?day job? is energy modeling with E+, not load calculations.

In no particular order:

1.       I suspect you are correct to assume that E+ has a more rigorous load calculation routine, but do not know much about HAP

2.       I applaud your effort to ?right size? equipment.  There is a lot of anecdotal and some published information which suggests up to 50% oversizing for cooling systems, and everyone wins if less capacity can be installed and still work properly.

3.       I have the feeling that HAP and E+ define various load differently.  

a.       There?s no other reason why HAP would show a solar load in the middle of the night; that?s plainly wrong if we?re talking about true solar impact. 

b.      Similarly for roof conduction, ASHRAE and thermodynamics tell us that a roof will probably radiate energy to the night sky at least in the pre-dawn hours (and thus give a negative load to the zone).  HAP is showing low, declining, but still positive values at all hours.  Not knowing your roof construction, however, I am not sure what to expect.

c.       Lighting load for E+ reflects your lighting input energy, but HAP appears to be showing something like ?net load to the cooling system?

d.      Ditto for Occupant loads

e.      If it is true that E+ and HAP define things differently, I don?t think you can directly compare loads as you are doing in the ?E+ loads? and ?HAP loads? charts.   HAP seems to miss the lunchtime load dip altogether, for example.  Did you check the Output:Variable, zonename, Zone/Sys Sensible Load Predicted, Timestep? Or some other variable? (or check with OpenStudio or DesignBuilder to see what their graph data represents?)

4.       Floor conduction was a discussion thread on the EnergyPlus Yahoo forum about a month ago and, apparently, is a big factor in some zones.  This is a two-edged sword; if you ignore it, a major load influence may be missing.  If you include it, better define it properly!

5.       With properly or autosized systems, E+ always displays the same exactly-at-setpoint as you are showing.  I am not sure why HAP shows that the room is 1-2F away from setpoint.

6.       In the E+ Loads chart, there appears to be NO load from ?Computer + Equip? and ?Lighting? appears only during mid-day.

7.       In the ?HAP loads? chart, Window Transmission is always a positive load; I suspect that the outdoor temp falls below zone setpoint at some time during the night, so this should be a negative load.

 

Executive summary:  Load calculations are the stuff of which lawsuits are made if done poorly, so you want to be well informed about how your software is responding to your inputs.  HAP was, I think, primarily a load calc program that evolved to do energy calculations.  EnergyPlus was an energy calculation program that, with proper inputs can be used for load calculations.  You may want to nose around or ask a question on the E+ forum (http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EnergyPlus_Support/ ) or on the E+ Help Desk site (http://energyplus.helpserve.com/ ) for more on this topic.

If someone from your company attended the recent ASHRAE conference there was a great presentation on using simulation software to calculate loads. Results using a software package that calculates loads and also performs simulations showed a pretty good match, assuming thte assumptions for the space were the same. (i.e. worst case gains/schedules vs typical daily gains/schedules)

As you mention, heat balance method is the most fundamental procedure to use. There is certainly the potential for the results to be smaller numbers than what people at your company are accostomed to seeing. Your results show a pretty big difference though, for a relatively simplified case.

One item in your pilot results, for your test case it doesn?t look like the same temperatures were maintained, to get a true apples-to-apples comparison of the two methods (and to determine the load in your space for which the VAV terminal would be sized) the temperature should be maintained at the same level. Syncing those temperatures is only going to enhance the difference though, as e+ is currently a lower zone temp.

Also at the end of the occupied period the HAP temperature goes way up, and the e+ temperature drifts down (you mention heat loss through the slab? Seems like a pretty large ?T over the course of two hours from the slab), and it doesn?t look like the schedule inputs are an exact match. (e+ zone control starting at 7:00 a.m. and HAP starting at 5:00 a.m., etc., e+ run seems to have been pre-cooled while HAP was setback.)

Overall I think there might need to be a further review of what the e+ and HAP inputs/outputs are, and be sure that these are consistent with the load calculation assumptions in use at your company. As Jim mentioned, the space temperatures shouldn?t be diverging under a consistent set of assumptions.

Thanks for the response, do you happen to know what the name of the presentation was or who it was that did it? It sounds like just what I?m looking for.

To address the couple points you brought up, someone else had noticed that the HAP run was running at the high end of the throttle range (75 + 1.5?F default). I think since the space I used is very small , the floor slab has a larger than usual influence (high P/A). It seemed like in the unoccupied time HAP was still applying a small load through the transfer functions but ignoring the slab loss, hence why HAP goes up but E+ goes down. The schedules are the same, I had noticed that also and I think it is because the 75? setpoint is not hit until 7am even though cooling is available and the HAP run cooling is need as soon as it is available.  It just seemed odd that they could be so different for such a simple case.

-          Design Weather ? 95 db / 75 wb

I?m attaching some of the results, but overall the E+ calc has a lower peak load. Occupant, lighting and plug loads seem to follow their schedules. HAP looks like it very heavily weights the delayed load effect (TFM) even though I used a medium weight (70lb/ft2) wall (fyi - changing it to a lightweight wall has some but not a huge effect). HAP also ignores the slab heat loss in its cooling calculations. This shows up most clearly in the unoccupied zone temperature. In HAP the residual loads drive the temperature up to 82 where in the E+ calc the slab loss dominates, driving the temperature into the 60s. I could see leaving it out of the peak to be conservative but then allowing the unocc temperature to jump up overnight and having to deal with that load seems a bit too unrealistic. HAP also seems to over predict the peak roof conduction gain, probably due to the use of the sol-air temperatures, which I have read can over predict gains.

I tend to want to believe the E+ analysis because I know that it?s calculation methods are in general more rigorous but I am very interested what others may think, sim engines are known for being poor design load predictors (I?m looking at you eQuest) and HAP is a very established and trusted program.

Thanks in advance for anyone that feels like diving into this with me.

Brendan,

A couple thoughts on your comparison.  Having done comparisons like this with other tools and having worked with teams doing these comparisons with multiple tools, my experience is there are many pitfalls that its easy to fall into which can lead to a comparison of results that are not apples-to-apples. That makes it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions from the comparison.  The pitfalls that may be in play for your comparison:


1.     Heat Gain vs Load ? I suspect the component data from your EnergyPlus sim tool is ?heat gain? data while the component data from HAP is ?cooling load? data.  Therefore the comparison of results is heat gains versus loads and is not apples-to-apples.  Heat gain, of course, is heat from the individual sources like solar, occupants, lights.  The Load is heat transferred to air after going through the conversion process in the room involving conduction, radiation and convection.  I suspect the EnergyPlus results are heat gain for two reasons:


a.     In your ?Component Comparison.PDF? your EnergyPlus plots look much more like heat gain profiles than load profiles.  For example, the solar profile only has values when the sun is shining.  Solar values are zero at night  If this is a load profile that means the building mass has zero heat storage capacity.  The lighting and occupancy profiles are completely flat during mid-day which also looks like a heat gain profile, or else a load profile in a zero mass building..


b.    As you noted EnergyPlus uses the ?Heat Balance? load calculation method.  This method is a truer representation of building physics than other methods the industry has used like Transfer Functions and TA/TETD.  True building physics says there is no such thing as a component load like a ?wall load? or a ?people load? or a ?solar load?.  This is because once a heat gain enters a room, it gets mixed together with all the other heat gains through radiation and convection processes.  All you get from Heat Balance is THE LOAD ? total heat convected to the room air for the hour.  In that Load it is impossible to determine how much came from each individual heat gain source, so component loads cannot be defined.  Therefore an EnergyPlus calculation should not be able to produce a report of ?component loads?.  But it could produce a report with ?component heat gains?.


The Transfer Function Method (TFM) uses three key simplifying principles to speed up calculations.  One of these, the Principle of Superposition, results in loads being computed component by component.  That allows tools based on TFM to report component loads.  That?s part of the compromise of TFM ? you get speed and component loads in exchange for some amount of accuracy and inability to see component loads.


2.     Apples to Apples Input Data ? A common pitfall is not completely matching input data between the two programs.  Often this is caused by programs requiring different sets of inputs, using inputs in slightly different ways, or using similar terms with different meanings.  Often there is more than meets the eye to inputs and that can have adverse results in a comparison.  There isn?t enough information provided to say whether this happening in your comparison, but a couple things that would be worth considering:


a.     Weather Data ? You mention you used 95/75 as the design condition.  More important is whether the complete 24-hour design day DB and WB profiles match.  And also what solar data was used.  HAP is using an ASHRAE clear sky profile for solar radiation for the 21st day of each month.  Is EnergyPlus using something similar?


b.    Steady-Periodic ? Calculations using a single design day each month are aimed at reporting steady-periodic behavior.  Because heat transfer in the building is transient, you inevitably have to start with assumed initial conditions and then run the 24-hour cycle multiple times to damp out the effect of those initial conditions to get to steady periodic.  This is what HAP is doing.  If EnergyPlus does not automatically do this, it is important to force calculation of possibly 4-6 consecutive days of the same weather and heat gain conditions to get to an equivalent steady periodic set of results for comparison.


c.     Internal Loads ? Not all internal heat gains like lighting, equipment and occupants are created equal.  1 W/sqft lighting can have different load results, for example, depending on the fixture type because that will cause a different split between the radiative and convective fractions of the heat gain.  For example, load behavior of a 100 W heat gain from free hanging lights will be different from that for recessed unvented fixtures.  Equipment and occupant heat gains also have radiative and convective splits depending on the type of equipment or the type of occupant activity.  Its important to match the assumptions about radiative / convective split between the two tools being compared to get apples-to-apples load results.


d.    Envelope ? Wall and Roof assemblies need to have exactly the same sequence of material layers outside to inside, with each layer having a consistent set of thermal properties ? thickness, conductivity, density, specific heat.


3.     Floor Conduction Heat Loss ? Just based on intuition it looks to me like something strange is going on with your floor conduction heat loss. Its odd that the largest heat loss is occurring in the middle of the day when it is warmest outdoors and that heat loss magnitude is a significant percentage of the heat gain magnitude from other sources.  For this behavior to occur my guess is the surrounding soil temperature would have to be significantly colder than the indoor air and surface temperatures in the room.  Since this is a slab floor I wouldn?t think the near-surface temperature of the soil would be that cold on a 95 F day.  In addition, if detailed ground heat transfer calculations are being used in EnergyPlus, the heat transfer has very long transients on the order of weeks or months.  Could the huge heat losses represent the effect of initial conditions that assumed a cold ground temperature or a deep ground temperature?

Hope this helped in some way.  Would be interested to hear how your comparison turns out.

Hey all,

I am looking at an energy plus based sim program and one of the major selling points would be doing the load calcs in the same program as the energy modeling. From what I have read, the heat balance method that E+ uses should be more accurate than the transfer function method that a widely used load calc program like HAP would use. However the results are different so I wanted to get people?s thoughts on the subject.

I did a test case, a 20 x 20 office space (384 ft conditioned area) with one southern facing window.

-          10 ft tall

-          4 People

-          1 W/ft2 Lighting

-          0.5 W/ft2 Equipment

-          ASHRAE Office default schedules

-          Basic Walls and Roof, ASHRAE minimum windows (U=.55,SHGC=.4)

-          Design Weather ? 95 db / 75 wb

I?m attaching some of the results, but overall the E+ calc has a lower peak load. Occupant, lighting and plug loads seem to follow their schedules.

Steve Brunning from Newcomb & Boyd gave the presentation during Seminar 21 on Monday morning.

I would definitely re-run your simplified case without a slab to eliminate the effect of this variable, and circle back to it once you are otherwise satisfied with the results.

Right now you are trying to validate the concept, but may be getting tripped up with a model component that is difficult to model.

Here are some additional papers that might be useful for you on a similar topic regarding heat balance method for load calculations:

Definitely look at the other two presentations from that ASHRAE seminar as well.

Thanks for the response, do you happen to know what the name of the presentation was or who it was that did it? It sounds like just what I?m looking for.

To address the couple points you brought up, someone else had noticed that the HAP run was running at the high end of the throttle range (75 + 1.5?F default). I think since the space I used is very small , the floor slab has a larger than usual influence (high P/A). It seemed like in the unoccupied time HAP was still applying a small load through the transfer functions but ignoring the slab loss, hence why HAP goes up but E+ goes down. The schedules are the same, I had noticed that also and I think it is because the 75? setpoint is not hit until 7am even though cooling is available and the HAP run cooling is need as soon as it is available.  It just seemed odd that they could be so different for such a simple case.

If someone from your company attended the recent ASHRAE conference there was a great presentation on using simulation software to calculate loads. Results using a software package that calculates loads and also performs simulations showed a pretty good match, assuming thte assumptions for the space were the same. (i.e. worst case gains/schedules vs typical daily gains/schedules)

As you mention, heat balance method is the most fundamental procedure to use. There is certainly the potential for the results to be smaller numbers than what people at your company are accostomed to seeing. Your results show a pretty big difference though, for a relatively simplified case.

One item in your pilot results, for your test case it doesn?t look like the same temperatures were maintained, to get a true apples-to-apples comparison of the two methods (and to determine the load in your space for which the VAV terminal would be sized) the temperature should be maintained at the same level. Syncing those temperatures is only going to enhance the difference though, as e+ is currently a lower zone temp.

Also at the end of the occupied period the HAP temperature goes way up, and the e+ temperature drifts down (you mention heat loss through the slab? Seems like a pretty large ?T over the course of two hours from the slab), and it doesn?t look like the schedule inputs are an exact match. (e+ zone control starting at 7:00 a.m. and HAP starting at 5:00 a.m., etc., e+ run seems to have been pre-cooled while HAP was setback.)

Overall I think there might need to be a further review of what the e+ and HAP inputs/outputs are, and be sure that these are consistent with the load calculation assumptions in use at your company. As Jim mentioned, the space temperatures shouldn?t be diverging under a consistent set of assumptions.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Cooling Design Calc Methods

Dear Brendan,
Caveat emptor: I have not attempted this type of comparison, since my ?day job? is energy modeling with E+, not load calculations.
In no particular order:

1.       I suspect you are correct to assume that E+ has a more rigorous load calculation routine, but do not know much about HAP

2.       I applaud your effort to ?right size? equipment.  There is a lot of anecdotal and some published information which suggests up to 50% oversizing for cooling systems, and everyone wins if less capacity can be installed and still work properly.

3.       I have the feeling that HAP and E+ define various load differently.

a.       There?s no other reason why HAP would show a solar load in the middle of the night; that?s plainly wrong if we?re talking about true solar impact.

b.      Similarly for roof conduction, ASHRAE and thermodynamics tell us that a roof will probably radiate energy to the night sky at least in the pre-dawn hours (and thus give a negative load to the zone).  HAP is showing low, declining, but still positive values at all hours.  Not knowing your roof construction, however, I am not sure what to expect.

c.       Lighting load for E+ reflects your lighting input energy, but HAP appears to be showing something like ?net load to the cooling system?

d.      Ditto for Occupant loads

e.      If it is true that E+ and HAP define things differently, I don?t think you can directly compare loads as you are doing in the ?E+ loads? and ?HAP loads? charts.   HAP seems to miss the lunchtime load dip altogether, for example.  Did you check the Output:Variable, zonename, Zone/Sys Sensible Load Predicted, Timestep? Or some other variable? (or check with OpenStudio or DesignBuilder to see what their graph data represents?)

4.       Floor conduction was a discussion thread on the EnergyPlus Yahoo forum about a month ago and, apparently, is a big factor in some zones.  This is a two-edged sword; if you ignore it, a major load influence may be missing.  If you include it, better define it properly!

5.       With properly or autosized systems, E+ always displays the same exactly-at-setpoint as you are showing.  I am not sure why HAP shows that the room is 1-2F away from setpoint.

6.       In the E+ Loads chart, there appears to be NO load from ?Computer + Equip? and ?Lighting? appears only during mid-day.

7.       In the ?HAP loads? chart, Window Transmission is always a positive load; I suspect that the outdoor temp falls below zone setpoint at some time during the night, so this should be a negative load.

Executive summary:  Load calculations are the stuff of which lawsuits are made if done poorly, so you want to be well informed about how your software is responding to your inputs.  HAP was, I think, primarily a load calc program that evolved to do energy calculations.  EnergyPlus was an energy calculation program that, with proper inputs can be used for load calculations.  You may want to nose around or ask a question on the E+ forum (http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EnergyPlus_Support/ ) or on the E+ Help Desk site (http://energyplus.helpserve.com/ ) for more on this topic.

Brendan,

The ASHRAE Seminar was Seminar 21 presented on Monday morning (8:00 am session).  The presentation was by Steve Bruning ? 2nd of the 3 speakers.

I think the differences you note in the 2nd paragraph may still involve comparing heat gains with loads.  Because of building heat storage, a heat gain that occurs during one hour will result in loads spread over a series of following hours.  Late afternoon solar gains, for example, will spread their loads over a series of hours which can run into the evening, after the sun has set.  If you turn the equipment off at, say 6pm, the residual heat from those occupied operating period serve to raise the air temperature in the space overnight.

To Mr. Dirkes? point that there should not be solar loads at night.  I?d agree there should not be solar heat gains at night.  But there usually are solar loads after sunset because heat gain from the daylight hours is still going through the process of storage and heat release after the sun sets.  In a room with significant mass this can continue thru the nighttime hours.  As a qualitative check, Table 20 in Chapter 18 of the 2009 ASHRAE Handbook (Solar RTS factors) shows the decay period for a solar heat gain in a medium weight room varies from 19 to 21 hours in length.  A solar heat gain at 6pm would therefore still be converting to load at 1pm the next day.  Any heat gain with a radiative component has this type of behavior to one extent or another.

Hey all,

I am looking at an energy plus based sim program and one of the major selling points would be doing the load calcs in the same program as the energy modeling. From what I have read, the heat balance method that E+ uses should be more accurate than the transfer function method that a widely used load calc program like HAP would use. However the results are different so I wanted to get people?s thoughts on the subject.

I did a test case, a 20 x 20 office space (384 ft conditioned area) with one southern facing window.

-          10 ft tall

-          4 People

-          1 W/ft2 Lighting

-          0.5 W/ft2 Equipment

-          ASHRAE Office default schedules

-          Basic Walls and Roof, ASHRAE minimum windows (U=.55,SHGC=.4)

-          Design Weather ? 95 db / 75 wb

I?m attaching some of the results, but overall the E+ calc has a lower peak load. Occupant, lighting and plug loads seem to follow their schedules. HAP looks like it very heavily weights the delayed load effect (TFM) even though I used a medium weight (70lb/ft2) wall (fyi - changing it to a lightweight wall has some but not a huge effect). HAP also ignores the slab heat loss in its cooling calculations. This shows up most clearly in the unoccupied zone temperature. In HAP the residual loads drive the temperature up to 82 where in the E+ calc the slab loss dominates, driving the temperature into the 60s. I could see leaving it out of the peak to be conservative but then allowing the unocc temperature to jump up overnight and having to deal with that load seems a bit too unrealistic. HAP also seems to over predict the peak roof conduction gain, probably due to the use of the sol-air temperatures, which I have read can over predict gains.

I tend to want to believe the E+ analysis because I know that it?s calculation methods are in general more rigorous but I am very interested what others may think, sim engines are known for being poor design load predictors (I?m looking at you eQuest) and HAP is a very established and trusted program.

Thanks in advance for anyone that feels like diving into this with me.

Energyplus uses the same heat balance method as the RTS design calcs in the ASHRAE Fundamentals.

But the design calcs are different.. read up on the methods. I.E., no sun, no internal loads for heating. And full occupancy, full loads, etc for cooling.

Jim nailed it... Caveat emptor.

Hi Tim,

 

My name is James Hatheway.  I?m conducting a search on behalf of an energy-efficiency company that?s currently hiring experienced energy engineers, sales engineers, program managers, and energy advisors.  I thought I?d reach out to you in a networking effort and ask if you might know of anyone who might be interested in learning about these opportunities.  These are regular, full-time, permanent positions with full benefits and relocation assistance, and they?re with one of the top energy-efficiency companies in the country.  For the engineering openings, the company is seeking energy-efficiency engineers and sales engineers who have experience doing commercial, industrial, and/or institutional energy audits.  This company develops, implements, and manages energy-efficiency programs that help utilities manage load growth.  The programs target the commercial, industrial, institutional, and residential sectors.

 

The company currently has openings in several locations across the country.  Its offices are located in Arkansas, California, Washington D.C., Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, and Wisconsin.

 

For the engineering openings, I?m searching for energy engineers who have experience conducting building energy audits, identifying energy-efficiency opportunities, using energy-modeling tools such as DOE-2/eQUEST, performing energy-savings calculations, and/or developing measurement and verification (M&V) plans.  P.E. and/or C.E.M. certification is preferred but not required.

Would you possibly know of anyone who might be interested in learning more about these opportunities?

Thanks for all the info, the OK State papers address a lot of what I had been looking for. I?m going to try and track down that presentation sometime today. I know what I was doing was about equivalent to back of the envelope but I was looking to understand where the differences were as opposed to doing a thorough validation. My understanding of the design calc that E+ does was that it used the heat balance method but made certain assumptions that were typical of a load calc (ex no sun or interior loads in winter). The point that was made of being careful not to use loads and gains interchangeably was a very good one. I think some of my confusion was stemming from that. It appears that HAP reports component loads while E+ was reporting component gains, and would therefore look much different. I re-ran my E+ run with a adiabatic floor and it corrected much of the overnight heating/cooling disparity that I was seeing. Apparently, ASHRAE recommends excluding the floor loss in cooling design calculations, which is why it was correctly excluded in HAP. It looks like all of the difference in the peak cooling load is from the roof (yes they are defined the same), which could be explained by the difference between using HB and the sol-air temp method. Thanks everyone for all the comments, I think I?m slowly getting a more complete picture of this process.

Brendan,

The ASHRAE Seminar was Seminar 21 presented on Monday morning (8:00 am session).  The presentation was by Steve Bruning ? 2nd of the 3 speakers.

I think the differences you note in the 2nd paragraph may still involve comparing heat gains with loads.  Because of building heat storage, a heat gain that occurs during one hour will result in loads spread over a series of following hours.  Late afternoon solar gains, for example, will spread their loads over a series of hours which can run into the evening, after the sun has set.  If you turn the equipment off at, say 6pm, the residual heat from those occupied operating period serve to raise the air temperature in the space overnight.

To Mr. Dirkes? point that there should not be solar loads at night.  I?d agree there should not be solar heat gains at night.  But there usually are solar loads after sunset because heat gain from the daylight hours is still going through the process of storage and heat release after the sun sets.  In a room with significant mass this can continue thru the nighttime hours.  As a qualitative check, Table 20 in Chapter 18 of the 2009 ASHRAE Handbook (Solar RTS factors) shows the decay period for a solar heat gain in a medium weight room varies from 19 to 21 hours in length.  A solar heat gain at 6pm would therefore still be converting to load at 1pm the next day.  Any heat gain with a radiative component has this type of behavior to one extent or another.

Thanks for the response, do you happen to know what the name of the presentation was or who it was that did it? It sounds like just what I?m looking for.

To address the couple points you brought up, someone else had noticed that the HAP run was running at the high end of the throttle range (75 + 1.5?F default). I think since the space I used is very small , the floor slab has a larger than usual influence (high P/A). It seemed like in the unoccupied time HAP was still applying a small load through the transfer functions but ignoring the slab loss, hence why HAP goes up but E+ goes down. The schedules are the same, I had noticed that also and I think it is because the 75? setpoint is not hit until 7am even though cooling is available and the HAP run cooling is need as soon as it is available.  It just seemed odd that they could be so different for such a simple case.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Cooling Design Calc Methods

If someone from your company attended the recent ASHRAE conference there was a great presentation on using simulation software to calculate loads. Results using a software package that calculates loads and also performs simulations showed a pretty good match, assuming thte assumptions for the space were the same. (i.e. worst case gains/schedules vs typical daily gains/schedules)

As you mention, heat balance method is the most fundamental procedure to use. There is certainly the potential for the results to be smaller numbers than what people at your company are accostomed to seeing. Your results show a pretty big difference though, for a relatively simplified case.

One item in your pilot results, for your test case it doesn?t look like the same temperatures were maintained, to get a true apples-to-apples comparison of the two methods (and to determine the load in your space for which the VAV terminal would be sized) the temperature should be maintained at the same level. Syncing those temperatures is only going to enhance the difference though, as e+ is currently a lower zone temp.

Also at the end of the occupied period the HAP temperature goes way up, and the e+ temperature drifts down (you mention heat loss through the slab? Seems like a pretty large ?T over the course of two hours from the slab), and it doesn?t look like the schedule inputs are an exact match. (e+ zone control starting at 7:00 a.m. and HAP starting at 5:00 a.m., etc., e+ run seems to have been pre-cooled while HAP was setback.)

Overall I think there might need to be a further review of what the e+ and HAP inputs/outputs are, and be sure that these are consistent with the load calculation assumptions in use at your company. As Jim mentioned, the space temperatures shouldn?t be diverging under a consistent set of assumptions.

Dear Brendan,
Caveat emptor: I have not attempted this type of comparison, since my ?day job? is energy modeling with E+, not load calculations.
In no particular order:

1.       I suspect you are correct to assume that E+ has a more rigorous load calculation routine, but do not know much about HAP

2.       I applaud your effort to ?right size? equipment.  There is a lot of anecdotal and some published information which suggests up to 50% oversizing for cooling systems, and everyone wins if less capacity can be installed and still work properly.

3.       I have the feeling that HAP and E+ define various load differently.

a.       There?s no other reason why HAP would show a solar load in the middle of the night; that?s plainly wrong if we?re talking about true solar impact.

b.      Similarly for roof conduction, ASHRAE and thermodynamics tell us that a roof will probably radiate energy to the night sky at least in the pre-dawn hours (and thus give a negative load to the zone).  HAP is showing low, declining, but still positive values at all hours.  Not knowing your roof construction, however, I am not sure what to expect.

c.       Lighting load for E+ reflects your lighting input energy, but HAP appears to be showing something like ?net load to the cooling system?

d.      Ditto for Occupant loads

e.      If it is true that E+ and HAP define things differently, I don?t think you can directly compare loads as you are doing in the ?E+ loads? and ?HAP loads? charts.   HAP seems to miss the lunchtime load dip altogether, for example.  Did you check the Output:Variable, zonename, Zone/Sys Sensible Load Predicted, Timestep? Or some other variable? (or check with OpenStudio or DesignBuilder to see what their graph data represents?)

4.       Floor conduction was a discussion thread on the EnergyPlus Yahoo forum about a month ago and, apparently, is a big factor in some zones.  This is a two-edged sword; if you ignore it, a major load influence may be missing.  If you include it, better define it properly!

5.       With properly or autosized systems, E+ always displays the same exactly-at-setpoint as you are showing.  I am not sure why HAP shows that the room is 1-2F away from setpoint.

6.       In the E+ Loads chart, there appears to be NO load from ?Computer + Equip? and ?Lighting? appears only during mid-day.

7.       In the ?HAP loads? chart, Window Transmission is always a positive load; I suspect that the outdoor temp falls below zone setpoint at some time during the night, so this should be a negative load.

Executive summary:  Load calculations are the stuff of which lawsuits are made if done poorly, so you want to be well informed about how your software is responding to your inputs.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Cooling Design Calc Methods

Hey all,

I am looking at an energy plus based sim program and one of the major selling points would be doing the load calcs in the same program as the energy modeling. From what I have read, the heat balance method that E+ uses should be more accurate than the transfer function method that a widely used load calc program like HAP would use. However the results are different so I wanted to get people?s thoughts on the subject.

I did a test case, a 20 x 20 office space (384 ft conditioned area) with one southern facing window.

-          10 ft tall

-          4 People

-          1 W/ft2 Lighting

-          0.5 W/ft2 Equipment

-          ASHRAE Office default schedules

-          Basic Walls and Roof, ASHRAE minimum windows (U=.55,SHGC=.4)

-          Design Weather ? 95 db / 75 wb

I?m attaching some of the results, but overall the E+ calc has a lower peak load. Occupant, lighting and plug loads seem to follow their schedules. HAP looks like it very heavily weights the delayed load effect (TFM) even though I used a medium weight (70lb/ft2) wall (fyi - changing it to a lightweight wall has some but not a huge effect). HAP also ignores the slab heat loss in its cooling calculations. This shows up most clearly in the unoccupied zone temperature. In HAP the residual loads drive the temperature up to 82 where in the E+ calc the slab loss dominates, driving the temperature into the 60s. I could see leaving it out of the peak to be conservative but then allowing the unocc temperature to jump up overnight and having to deal with that load seems a bit too unrealistic. HAP also seems to over predict the peak roof conduction gain, probably due to the use of the sol-air temperatures, which I have read can over predict gains.

I tend to want to believe the E+ analysis because I know that it?s calculation methods are in general more rigorous but I am very interested what others may think, sim engines are known for being poor design load predictors (I?m looking at you eQuest) and HAP is a very established and trusted program.

Thanks in advance for anyone that feels like diving into this with me.

Brendan/Jim,
I have also been testing differences between EnergyPlus and other software that use the transfer function method i.e. eQUEST. My goal was to compare the energy consumption differences between the two software with different system types. My first step was to make sure to check that the loads being calculated by both programs were consistent. Overall the results were in agreement when using the ideal air loads system in EnergyPlus. However, once I confirmed that the annual loads calculated by both programs were in agreement I changed the system in EnergyPlus to a VAV reheat system and the annual loads (not design day peak loads) were quite a bit different even though they maintained a similar profile.  I have not figured out what might be causing this difference, could it be the iterative nature between loads and systems in EnergyPlus?

I agree with Jim that what you might be comparing are loads in one program with gains in another, I did the same when I first looked at the results of the test case I was running and was trying to figure out what was causing such a huge difference. Its also very important to maintain the exact inputs in both programs, for example for all envelope parameters, keeping the thermal properties (heat capacity, density) and thickness the same and not just the overall U-value.

See below and attached for some of these results.

Brendan,

The ASHRAE Seminar was Seminar 21 presented on Monday morning (8:00 am session).  The presentation was by Steve Bruning ? 2nd of the 3 speakers.

I think the differences you note in the 2nd paragraph may still involve comparing heat gains with loads.  Because of building heat storage, a heat gain that occurs during one hour will result in loads spread over a series of following hours.  Late afternoon solar gains, for example, will spread their loads over a series of hours which can run into the evening, after the sun has set.  If you turn the equipment off at, say 6pm, the residual heat from those occupied operating period serve to raise the air temperature in the space overnight.

To Mr. Dirkes? point that there should not be solar loads at night.  I?d agree there should not be solar heat gains at night.  But there usually are solar loads after sunset because heat gain from the daylight hours is still going through the process of storage and heat release after the sun sets.  In a room with significant mass this can continue thru the nighttime hours.  As a qualitative check, Table 20 in Chapter 18 of the 2009 ASHRAE Handbook (Solar RTS factors) shows the decay period for a solar heat gain in a medium weight room varies from 19 to 21 hours in length.  A solar heat gain at 6pm would therefore still be converting to load at 1pm the next day.  Any heat gain with a radiative component has this type of behavior to one extent or another.

Thanks for the response, do you happen to know what the name of the presentation was or who it was that did it? It sounds like just what I?m looking for.

To address the couple points you brought up, someone else had noticed that the HAP run was running at the high end of the throttle range (75 + 1.5?F default). I think since the space I used is very small , the floor slab has a larger than usual influence (high P/A). It seemed like in the unoccupied time HAP was still applying a small load through the transfer functions but ignoring the slab loss, hence why HAP goes up but E+ goes down. The schedules are the same, I had noticed that also and I think it is because the 75? setpoint is not hit until 7am even though cooling is available and the HAP run cooling is need as soon as it is available.  It just seemed odd that they could be so different for such a simple case.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Cooling Design Calc Methods

If someone from your company attended the recent ASHRAE conference there was a great presentation on using simulation software to calculate loads. Results using a software package that calculates loads and also performs simulations showed a pretty good match, assuming thte assumptions for the space were the same. (i.e. worst case gains/schedules vs typical daily gains/schedules)

As you mention, heat balance method is the most fundamental procedure to use. There is certainly the potential for the results to be smaller numbers than what people at your company are accostomed to seeing. Your results show a pretty big difference though, for a relatively simplified case.

One item in your pilot results, for your test case it doesn?t look like the same temperatures were maintained, to get a true apples-to-apples comparison of the two methods (and to determine the load in your space for which the VAV terminal would be sized) the temperature should be maintained at the same level. Syncing those temperatures is only going to enhance the difference though, as e+ is currently a lower zone temp.

Also at the end of the occupied period the HAP temperature goes way up, and the e+ temperature drifts down (you mention heat loss through the slab? Seems like a pretty large ?T over the course of two hours from the slab), and it doesn?t look like the schedule inputs are an exact match. (e+ zone control starting at 7:00 a.m. and HAP starting at 5:00 a.m., etc., e+ run seems to have been pre-cooled while HAP was setback.)

Overall I think there might need to be a further review of what the e+ and HAP inputs/outputs are, and be sure that these are consistent with the load calculation assumptions in use at your company. As Jim mentioned, the space temperatures shouldn?t be diverging under a consistent set of assumptions.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Cooling Design Calc Methods

Dear Brendan,
Caveat emptor: I have not attempted this type of comparison, since my ?day job? is energy modeling with E+, not load calculations.
In no particular order:

1.       I suspect you are correct to assume that E+ has a more rigorous load calculation routine, but do not know much about HAP

2.       I applaud your effort to ?right size? equipment.  There is a lot of anecdotal and some published information which suggests up to 50% oversizing for cooling systems, and everyone wins if less capacity can be installed and still work properly.

3.       I have the feeling that HAP and E+ define various load differently.

a.       There?s no other reason why HAP would show a solar load in the middle of the night; that?s plainly wrong if we?re talking about true solar impact.

b.      Similarly for roof conduction, ASHRAE and thermodynamics tell us that a roof will probably radiate energy to the night sky at least in the pre-dawn hours (and thus give a negative load to the zone).  HAP is showing low, declining, but still positive values at all hours.  Not knowing your roof construction, however, I am not sure what to expect.

c.       Lighting load for E+ reflects your lighting input energy, but HAP appears to be showing something like ?net load to the cooling system?

d.      Ditto for Occupant loads

e.      If it is true that E+ and HAP define things differently, I don?t think you can directly compare loads as you are doing in the ?E+ loads? and ?HAP loads? charts.   HAP seems to miss the lunchtime load dip altogether, for example.  Did you check the Output:Variable, zonename, Zone/Sys Sensible Load Predicted, Timestep? Or some other variable? (or check with OpenStudio or DesignBuilder to see what their graph data represents?)

4.       Floor conduction was a discussion thread on the EnergyPlus Yahoo forum about a month ago and, apparently, is a big factor in some zones.  This is a two-edged sword; if you ignore it, a major load influence may be missing.  If you include it, better define it properly!

5.       With properly or autosized systems, E+ always displays the same exactly-at-setpoint as you are showing.  I am not sure why HAP shows that the room is 1-2F away from setpoint.

6.       In the E+ Loads chart, there appears to be NO load from ?Computer + Equip? and ?Lighting? appears only during mid-day.

7.       In the ?HAP loads? chart, Window Transmission is always a positive load; I suspect that the outdoor temp falls below zone setpoint at some time during the night, so this should be a negative load.

Executive summary:  Load calculations are the stuff of which lawsuits are made if done poorly, so you want to be well informed about how your software is responding to your inputs.  HAP was, I think, primarily a load calc program that evolved to do energy calculations.  EnergyPlus was an energy calculation program that, with proper inputs can be used for load calculations.  You may want to nose around or ask a question on the E+ forum (http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EnergyPlus_Support/ ) or on the E+ Help Desk site (http://energyplus.helpserve.com/ ) for more on this topic.

Brendan,

ASHRAE recommends excluding the floor heat loss for commercial cooling 
design calculations, not for residential. If you look at the residential 
calculation example in ASHRAE HoF, you can see that the floor heat loss 
is a significant portion of the total load. What I mean is that if you 
exclude the floor loss, and then apply your safety factor, you will end 
up with an oversized AC.

In fact, we have tried the same exercise as what you have done. We 
compared EPlus with whatever the mechanical engineer was using for the 
sizing (in an existing building), and then go to the actual unit itself 
on a design day (i.e. a hot day with max temp higher than the design 
temperature) and ensure that the internal gains are as assumed in the 
calculation. Then we look at the compressor operation during that day, 
and estimate how much oversized the compressor is. We practically nailed 
down everything else, except the floor loss. When I tried using 
adiabatic floor like you did, I got exactly the same sizing result as 
what the mechanical engineer had (I cannot remember what they used, but 
it was not HAP), of course with other assumptions being equal.

Can anybody enlighten me on why there should be any difference between 
commercial and residential design calculation with respect to the floor 
loss? The small commercial spaces that we have worked on are just like 
residential spaces, only with different profiles of occupancy, lighting 
and equipment, plus ventilation requirements of course. For multifloor 
commercial buildings, yes floor heat loss is tiny. But for small single 
story commercial buildings, floor heat loss is significant.

Jim, shouldn't you do this on every project?

Our lab does not do design, but we end up doing this type of comparison 
on virtually every project. There is no point of energy savings if we 
are still designing an energy hog. Like you said, load calc is not our 
job. But its our job to educate the owner that their building must have 
an optimal load, and that has to be reflected in the system and plant 
sizes. ONLY when the load is optimized, then we can talk about saving 
some energy.

Of course there is ALWAYS some resistance (in various degrees) from the 
mechanical engineers, but we usually succeed in streamlining our inputs 
with the load calc inputs (read: to make their assumptions less 
conservative and reduce their safety factor, that we end up with an 
optimum peak loads).

I believe that you have a similar experience. Care to share with the 
forum about your experience on this?

Mirza,
It appears that the peak loads compare closely between the two programs.
Energy, however, does not compare well; with eQuest consistently and significantly projecting higher energy.
My guess is that, assuming you have diligently compared all of the major input values, the two programs use different partial loading curves for fan and cooling system.

Brendan/Jim,
I have also been testing differences between EnergyPlus and other software that use the transfer function method i.e. eQUEST. My goal was to compare the energy consumption differences between the two software with different system types. My first step was to make sure to check that the loads being calculated by both programs were consistent. Overall the results were in agreement when using the ideal air loads system in EnergyPlus. However, once I confirmed that the annual loads calculated by both programs were in agreement I changed the system in EnergyPlus to a VAV reheat system and the annual loads (not design day peak loads) were quite a bit different even though they maintained a similar profile.  I have not figured out what might be causing this difference, could it be the iterative nature between loads and systems in EnergyPlus?

I agree with Jim that what you might be comparing are loads in one program with gains in another, I did the same when I first looked at the results of the test case I was running and was trying to figure out what was causing such a huge difference. Its also very important to maintain the exact inputs in both programs, for example for all envelope parameters, keeping the thermal properties (heat capacity, density) and thickness the same and not just the overall U-value.

See below and attached for some of these results.

Brendan,

The ASHRAE Seminar was Seminar 21 presented on Monday morning (8:00 am session).  The presentation was by Steve Bruning ? 2nd of the 3 speakers.

I think the differences you note in the 2nd paragraph may still involve comparing heat gains with loads.  Because of building heat storage, a heat gain that occurs during one hour will result in loads spread over a series of following hours.  Late afternoon solar gains, for example, will spread their loads over a series of hours which can run into the evening, after the sun has set.  If you turn the equipment off at, say 6pm, the residual heat from those occupied operating period serve to raise the air temperature in the space overnight.

To Mr. Dirkes? point that there should not be solar loads at night.  I?d agree there should not be solar heat gains at night.  But there usually are solar loads after sunset because heat gain from the daylight hours is still going through the process of storage and heat release after the sun sets.  In a room with significant mass this can continue thru the nighttime hours.  As a qualitative check, Table 20 in Chapter 18 of the 2009 ASHRAE Handbook (Solar RTS factors) shows the decay period for a solar heat gain in a medium weight room varies from 19 to 21 hours in length.  A solar heat gain at 6pm would therefore still be converting to load at 1pm the next day.  Any heat gain with a radiative component has this type of behavior to one extent or another.

Thanks for the response, do you happen to know what the name of the presentation was or who it was that did it? It sounds like just what I?m looking for.

To address the couple points you brought up, someone else had noticed that the HAP run was running at the high end of the throttle range (75 + 1.5?F default). I think since the space I used is very small , the floor slab has a larger than usual influence (high P/A). It seemed like in the unoccupied time HAP was still applying a small load through the transfer functions but ignoring the slab loss, hence why HAP goes up but E+ goes down. The schedules are the same, I had noticed that also and I think it is because the 75? setpoint is not hit until 7am even though cooling is available and the HAP run cooling is need as soon as it is available.  It just seemed odd that they could be so different for such a simple case.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Cooling Design Calc Methods

If someone from your company attended the recent ASHRAE conference there was a great presentation on using simulation software to calculate loads. Results using a software package that calculates loads and also performs simulations showed a pretty good match, assuming thte assumptions for the space were the same. (i.e. worst case gains/schedules vs typical daily gains/schedules)

As you mention, heat balance method is the most fundamental procedure to use. There is certainly the potential for the results to be smaller numbers than what people at your company are accostomed to seeing. Your results show a pretty big difference though, for a relatively simplified case.

One item in your pilot results, for your test case it doesn?t look like the same temperatures were maintained, to get a true apples-to-apples comparison of the two methods (and to determine the load in your space for which the VAV terminal would be sized) the temperature should be maintained at the same level. Syncing those temperatures is only going to enhance the difference though, as e+ is currently a lower zone temp.

Also at the end of the occupied period the HAP temperature goes way up, and the e+ temperature drifts down (you mention heat loss through the slab? Seems like a pretty large ?T over the course of two hours from the slab), and it doesn?t look like the schedule inputs are an exact match. (e+ zone control starting at 7:00 a.m. and HAP starting at 5:00 a.m., etc., e+ run seems to have been pre-cooled while HAP was setback.)

Overall I think there might need to be a further review of what the e+ and HAP inputs/outputs are, and be sure that these are consistent with the load calculation assumptions in use at your company. As Jim mentioned, the space temperatures shouldn?t be diverging under a consistent set of assumptions.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Cooling Design Calc Methods

Dear Brendan,
Caveat emptor: I have not attempted this type of comparison, since my ?day job? is energy modeling with E+, not load calculations.
In no particular order:

1.       I suspect you are correct to assume that E+ has a more rigorous load calculation routine, but do not know much about HAP

2.       I applaud your effort to ?right size? equipment.  There is a lot of anecdotal and some published information which suggests up to 50% oversizing for cooling systems, and everyone wins if less capacity can be installed and still work properly.

3.       I have the feeling that HAP and E+ define various load differently.

a.       There?s no other reason why HAP would show a solar load in the middle of the night; that?s plainly wrong if we?re talking about true solar impact.

b.      Similarly for roof conduction, ASHRAE and thermodynamics tell us that a roof will probably radiate energy to the night sky at least in the pre-dawn hours (and thus give a negative load to the zone).  HAP is showing low, declining, but still positive values at all hours.  Not knowing your roof construction, however, I am not sure what to expect.

c.       Lighting load for E+ reflects your lighting input energy, but HAP appears to be showing something like ?net load to the cooling system?

d.      Ditto for Occupant loads

e.      If it is true that E+ and HAP define things differently, I don?t think you can directly compare loads as you are doing in the ?E+ loads? and ?HAP loads? charts.   HAP seems to miss the lunchtime load dip altogether, for example.  Did you check the Output:Variable, zonename, Zone/Sys Sensible Load Predicted, Timestep? Or some other variable? (or check with OpenStudio or DesignBuilder to see what their graph data represents?)

4.       Floor conduction was a discussion thread on the EnergyPlus Yahoo forum about a month ago and, apparently, is a big factor in some zones.  This is a two-edged sword; if you ignore it, a major load influence may be missing.  If you include it, better define it properly!

5.       With properly or autosized systems, E+ always displays the same exactly-at-setpoint as you are showing.  I am not sure why HAP shows that the room is 1-2F away from setpoint.

6.       In the E+ Loads chart, there appears to be NO load from ?Computer + Equip? and ?Lighting? appears only during mid-day.

7.       In the ?HAP loads? chart, Window Transmission is always a positive load; I suspect that the outdoor temp falls below zone setpoint at some time during the night, so this should be a negative load.

Executive summary:  Load calculations are the stuff of which lawsuits are made if done poorly, so you want to be well informed about how your software is responding to your inputs.  HAP was, I think, primarily a load calc program that evolved to do energy calculations.  EnergyPlus was an energy calculation program that, with proper inputs can be used for load calculations.  You may want to nose around or ask a question on the E+ forum (http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EnergyPlus_Support/ ) or on the E+ Help Desk site (http://energyplus.helpserve.com/ ) for more on this topic.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Cooling Design Calc Methods

Hey all,

I am looking at an energy plus based sim program and one of the major selling points would be doing the load calcs in the same program as the energy modeling. From what I have read, the heat balance method that E+ uses should be more accurate than the transfer function method that a widely used load calc program like HAP would use. However the results are different so I wanted to get people?s thoughts on the subject.

I did a test case, a 20 x 20 office space (384 ft conditioned area) with one southern facing window.

-          10 ft tall

-          4 People

-          1 W/ft2 Lighting

-          0.5 W/ft2 Equipment

-          ASHRAE Office default schedules

-          Basic Walls and Roof, ASHRAE minimum windows (U=.55,SHGC=.4)

-          Design Weather ? 95 db / 75 wb

I?m attaching some of the results, but overall the E+ calc has a lower peak load. Occupant, lighting and plug loads seem to follow their schedules. HAP looks like it very heavily weights the delayed load effect (TFM) even though I used a medium weight (70lb/ft2) wall (fyi - changing it to a lightweight wall has some but not a huge effect). HAP also ignores the slab heat loss in its cooling calculations. This shows up most clearly in the unoccupied zone temperature. In HAP the residual loads drive the temperature up to 82 where in the E+ calc the slab loss dominates, driving the temperature into the 60s. I could see leaving it out of the peak to be conservative but then allowing the unocc temperature to jump up overnight and having to deal with that load seems a bit too unrealistic. HAP also seems to over predict the peak roof conduction gain, probably due to the use of the sol-air temperatures, which I have read can over predict gains.

I tend to want to believe the E+ analysis because I know that it?s calculation methods are in general more rigorous but I am very interested what others may think, sim engines are known for being poor design load predictors (I?m looking at you eQuest) and HAP is a very established and trusted program.

Thanks in advance for anyone that feels like diving into this with me.

Is there any data out there comparing the results from: load calcs, energy models loads, and measured loads (maybe 3 years of data as not every year has a design day)?

That would be the only way to be sure to say which approach is better. Of course the assumption would have to be made that the load calcs and energy model were completed correctly.

Compiling a statistically significant data set would probably be quite the undertaking, but would make a nice master?s thesis. If we?re lucky, someone has already done the work.

You may want to nose around or ask a question on the E+ forum (http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EnergyPlus_Support/ ) or on the E+ Help Desk site (http://energyplus.helpserve.com/ ) for more on this topic.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Cooling Design Calc Methods

Hey all,

I am looking at an energy plus based sim program and one of the major selling points would be doing the load calcs in the same program as the energy modeling. From what I have read, the heat balance method that E+ uses should be more accurate than the transfer function method that a widely used load calc program like HAP would use. However the results are different so I wanted to get people?s thoughts on the subject.

I did a test case, a 20 x 20 office space (384 ft conditioned area) with one southern facing window.

-          10 ft tall

-          4 People

-          1 W/ft2 Lighting

-          0.5 W/ft2 Equipment

-          ASHRAE Office default schedules

-          Basic Walls and Roof, ASHRAE minimum windows (U=.55,SHGC=.4)

-          Design Weather ? 95 db / 75 wb

I?m attaching some of the results, but overall the E+ calc has a lower peak load. Occupant, lighting and plug loads seem to follow their schedules. HAP looks like it very heavily weights the delayed load effect (TFM) even though I used a medium weight (70lb/ft2) wall (fyi - changing it to a lightweight wall has some but not a huge effect). HAP also ignores the slab heat loss in its cooling calculations. This shows up most clearly in the unoccupied zone temperature. In HAP the residual loads drive the temperature up to 82 where in the E+ calc the slab loss dominates, driving the temperature into the 60s. I could see leaving it out of the peak to be conservative but then allowing the unocc temperature to jump up overnight and having to deal with that load seems a bit too unrealistic. HAP also seems to over predict the peak roof conduction gain, probably due to the use of the sol-air temperatures, which I have read can over predict gains.

I tend to want to believe the E+ analysis because I know that it?s calculation methods are in general more rigorous but I am very interested what others may think, sim engines are known for being poor design load predictors (I?m looking at you eQuest) and HAP is a very established and trusted program.

Thanks in advance for anyone that feels like diving into this with me.

Dear  Ery,
Your point is well made!  Several things come to mind in response:

*         I was not aware previously and do not have enough data from this thread to be convinced that something like E+ is significantly better than the "originally a load calculation" software like HAP or Trace.

*         If I did have that conviction, I think it would be hard to convey that to the design engineer.  It's a hard sell to convince one of us stodgy engineers to use something different than our ASHRAE-compliant load software and take more risk (by sizing smaller) when we're in a big hurry and very design-budget-constrained.

o   On one project when I was barely out of the University, I sized a heating system here in Michigan USA with no "safety factor" because I was very confident of my calculations.  After its installation, the office area would not get above 20C / 68F when winter temperatures were near the design condition.  I checked every aspect of operation and triple-checked my calculations in order to fix the problem and save face - and failed.  My company didn't fire me when we had to pay for heating upgrades, but they were not happy!  After that, I resolved to "size generously with excellent part load operation".  I still think that is a reasonable approach, but I am smarter now and might still be willing to specify the smaller size instead of a larger size.

*         I do use E+ for load calculations when performing a detailed energy audit.  My conviction and my experience say that most equipment is oversized and if a piece of equipment needs replacing, we may as well recommend replacing with the proper size.  One recent project replaced the existing boiler with one 1/3 the original size!  (Another project kept the same size boiler.)

*         This brings up another major reason for oversizing.  If I need a 320 ton capacity chiller per my load calculations, I must choose between a 300 ton or a 350-400 ton machine.  Which will I choose?  Will internal loads from PCs go up or down?  If they go up, will my company be blamed for the cooling system inability to meet the load? Heck,  the 350 ton chiller doesn't cost that much more; I'm likely to play it safe!  It's worse on a percentage basis when my load is 5.5 tons and I must choose between a 5 ton and 7.5 ton system.

*         Finally, (can you tell I've thought about this before :)?) most of us Americans love to be comfortable ALL the time - at home, in the car, at work, while shopping and at the restaurant - no exceptions (We're all comfort wimps).  Even though the peak heating and cooling conditions only occur a few hours every year, few are tolerant of a little discomfort for those few hours.

*         Although all of the above is true, I know there are abuses in the design community that could be gently corrected.  As part of a recent commissioning project, I reviewed load calculations and found that the engineer was using 5W / sq.ft (>50W / sq.m) for internal loads ... in a standard office!  On top of that, he refused to make any changes when I pointed it out.  "Too much work to change and it will work OK as is."

*         All in all, the bottom line is probably something like "encourage excellence in the engineering community" and promote the benefits of excellence.   One of my mottos is "Excellence pays" - that is, excellence does not cost more, it pays you back.

p.s., In case readers are not aware of ASHRAE Standard 140, it is used to compare results of energy analysis programs for a set of standardized systems to a  reference calculation.  I don't think it focusses on peak loads, however.

Caveat emptor: I have not attempted this type of comparison, since my "day job" is energy modeling with E+, not load calculations.

Jim, shouldn't you do this on every project?

Our lab does not do design, but we end up doing this type of comparison on virtually every project. There is no point of energy savings if we are still designing an energy hog. Like you said, load calc is not our job. But its our job to educate the owner that their building must have an optimal load, and that has to be reflected in the system and plant sizes. ONLY when the load is optimized, then we can talk about saving some energy.

Of course there is ALWAYS some resistance (in various degrees) from the mechanical engineers, but we usually succeed in streamlining our inputs with the load calc inputs (read: to make their assumptions less conservative and reduce their safety factor, that we end up with an optimum peak loads).

I believe that you have a similar experience. Care to share with the forum about your experience on this?

SimBuild Pre-Conference Workshop: IBPSA-USA presents Building Energy 
Modeling
Training

The Building Energy Modeling one-day seminar has been offered by 
IBPSA-USA in
more than 12 cities in North America over the last two years.

It is being offered on July 30, 2012, in two sessions prior to the 
SimBuild
conference in Madison, Wisconsin. Substantial discounts are available 
to
students and practicing modelers.  A new segment on life cycle cost 
analysis has
been added.

The main objective of the BEM Training is to improve modeling quality.

The morning session is designed for beginners and covers topics 
critical to the
effective delivery of energy modeling services, including:

v    ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2007 and LEED
v    High performance, low energy buildings
v    New and existing building modeling

The afternoon session is intermediate level and covers the following 
topics:

v    Modeling best practices
v    Modeling tools to support best practices
v    Modeling procedure for integrated design
v    Life Cycle Cost Analysis (newly added**)

  **This portion of the training session will teach attendees the basics 
of life
cycle cost analysis theory and application. Life cycle cost analysis is 
the
concept of designing projects with recognition of the costs and savings
associated with the project over all phases of this life cycle. This 
includes
first costs and savings, operation and maintenance, energy savings, and
replacement/retirement. Life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) can be a 
comparative
process where multiple scenarios are analyzed and weighed against one 
another to
help inform the final design. LCCA can assist designers in making 
decisions
ranging in scope from a single piece of equipment to an entire 
building.
Effective life cycle cost analysis also includes an examination of the
qualitative benefits of a design and how these benefits compare to 
their
associated costs and savings. The training will include case studies to
highlight how the LCCA process can be used  to assist in design and how 
LCCA
work should be structured around the  typical architectural
design process.

Message-ID: <CAO-C-93etForO1vXF285xtoqZr+R1G4FOU9pq0H0a=HKtUsgYQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,



I am working on a California project pursuing Title-24 2008 and using
eQuest for the analysis. The project includes VAV with chilled water
cooling and hot water reheat system . Additionally the system is 100% OA
system and also includes indirect evaporative pre-cooling in the design. My
model indicates that the evaporative pre-cooling is helping on the cooling
energy savings ( as expected) but I am getting heating penalty because of
it.



After digging into the simulation output reports it seems that the reheat
energy has increased significantly and the space temperature for the zones
have more hours in the cooling temperature band. I believe that the
evaporative pre-cooling is overcooling the spaces. Further, I think that
the evaporative pre-cooling is treating OA with dry bulb as low as 55F.



Can somebody please suggest how to control the evaporative pre-cooling so
that it comes on for OA above 70F temperature only. eQuest has a high limit
set point for evaporative pre coolers but no low limit one.  Also, any
thoughts on how to control the increase in reheat energy.



Thank you



Nidhi

Dear Nidhi,
I am not familiar with eQuest, so I cannot help much with the specifics of that program.
About one year ago I modeled an indirect evaporative system (Maisotsenko cycle specifically) in EnergyPlus and had some difficulties which I have noted below.  They may help focus your efforts!

1.            Energy Plus version 6 cannot place the condenser coil in the exhaust of an indirect evaporative cooler.  It can be defined with an evaporatively cooled condenser.  We assume that good results can be obtained by choosing the same evap effectiveness as for the M-cycle and making them both available for the same months.
2.            Energy Plus cannot currently model a VSD secondary / exhaust fan for an indirect evap cooler.  Energy reduction for both a cycling and VSD-equipped secondary / exhaust fan was assumed similar to that experienced by the supply fan.  This is modeled by reducing the secondary fan delta P  to xx%  (varies by climate) of actual.
3.            Secondary / exhaust air  can come only from the outdoors in EnergyPlus.  Thus no mixed air can be used.
4.            Economizer controls in EnergyPlus always look at the outdoor air temperature. We'd rather control based on the temp leaving the M cycle heat exchangers.  This requires a special, climate-specific schedule in EnergyPlus.  Not difficult, but takes more time.

Welcome to SimAUD 2013 <simaug.org/2013>

We are pleased to welcome you to the 4th annual Symposium on *Simulation 
for Architecture and Urban Design (SimAUD)*. This venue provides a 
fantastic opportunity for bringing together the brightest researchers 
and designers in the fields of architecture, building science, design, 
computer-aided design and simulation, and urban design. With the advent 
of high-performance computers and advanced design and simulation tools, 
we're have the tools to predict how buildings and whole neighborhoods 
will perform long before they're built. SimAUD contributes to the 
growing knowledge pool that will allow society to reduce the 
environmental and economic impact of the built environment, through 
simulation and modeling.

In past years, attendees have included researchers in simulation, 
architecture, urban design and planning, visualization; engineers, 
architects, software developers, managers, educators, business 
professionals.

Past SimAUD symposia have attracted exceptionally high-quality 
submissions (papers, notes, works in progress, datasets, and videos) on 
a diverse range of topics. We encourage you to take advantage of the 
free downloads of previous years' proceedings 
<http://www.simaud.org/proceedings/>. *We invite you to submit and 
present an original submission for SimAUD 2013 in San Diego, California, 
USA (April 7-10, 2013). *All submissions are peer-reviewed and if 
accepted, will be published in the ACM Digital Library. Please observe 
the submissions types and deadlines on the Symposium website 
(www.simaud.org/2013)<http://www.simaud.org/2013/call_for_submissions.php>. 
SimAUD is run collaboratively with _ACM/SIGSIM_ and is sponsored by _The

Dear Jim,

Thank you for your input.

In eQuest there is an option to use the return air as secondary air so that
is helpful.

I tried to control the evaporative pre-cooling entering air temperature
through economizer controls and schedules too but unfortunately nothing is
working out. If I look over the hourly reports i still see that evaporative
pre-cooling is treating the OA below 70F.

Again thank you for your help.

Nidhi

Dear All,

 

I model block of flats in TRNSYS. One Dwelling is one zone.

I am wondering how can I estimate heat capacitance of zones. I take into
account partition walls and air, but what about furniture and other
equipment?

 

Do you have some idea/experience? maybe some constant coefficient should be
applied by me?

 

Regards,

Dear Sheelam

The problem with your model is that it is set up to run the DBSim simulation
engine.  You need to set it up using the EnergyPlus simulation engine if you
wish to include daylight linked lighting control.

If you open your model in DesignBuilder you will notice in the top right
hand corner (as per below screenshot) that the DBSim logo is shown. 

 

 If you click on the box, it will open up the model settings dialog which
will allow you to choose the EnergyPlus option (assuming you have that
licence) and then you will be able to access more functionality than is
currently available in the DBSim model version.

Hope this helps.

Kind Regards

Paul

In my experience, no.  I've used the entering mixed air humidity ratio to
calculate entering wet bulb temperature, which is not an easy solution.

But, you can read every single page of ASHRAE 90.1-2010 for free (no download however) at http://www.ashrae.org/standards-research--technology/standards?guidelines .  Also, about 5 or 6 other standards as well.

Best wishes.

Hello everyone,

I am doing a case study about a office building in design builder(E+) using
the compact system (VAV with reheat +outside air set). While I set the
cooling setpoint schedule as only working during occupied hours(7-18), also
I check the E+ file that the schedule I set  is right. However, when I
check the meter about the cooling coils consumption, I realizedthe cooling
coil and fans are still working  during unoccupied hours, which confused me
a lot. Could someone experienced tell me the reason. Thanks so much.

Te Qi,
If the file uses a NightCycle Availability Manager, E+ will operate the HVAC during unoccupied hours to maintain the applicable setpoint.

Hi Everyone,

I am looking for a way to convert BIN files to Excel. I found that the DOE-2 Processor Utilities can convert BIN files into text files which could then be opened in excel.
The problem is that there is no instructions on how to use this.

Message-ID: <8f75988b1e3788b767d07086912fd4e0@tess-inc.com>

Dear Colleagues -

We are planning to hold a session of commercial software demos at the 
SimBuild conference in Madison.  I realize that it is rather late 
notice, but that is how things go with conference planning.

The format: "Speed Dating" - everyone will get 5 minutes to make a 
pitch to the audience concerning their software.  Then we will break 
apart to different tables where people can go see the demo of their 
choice.  These demos should be short enough that people can see multiple 
demos during the session if they so choose.

The schedule: Wednesday August 1st - 3-5 pm.

If you are interested in participating please send a paragraph 
describing your software and how it relates to the building performance 
modeling field by July 23, 2012 to simbuild2012 at gmail.com.

Regards,

Tim McDowell
SimBuild 2012 - conference chair

Agreeing: "total conditioned floor area."

If your takeoff places you on the cusp between one system type vs. another, it may save you a headache later to share/coordinate your takeoff now against the designers responsible for filling out the LEED project area inputs, to ensure they aren't going to report a disagreeable figure down the road.  This may also be a good time to evaluate & advise the design team whether either baseline system type happens to compare particularly favorably against the proposed design.

Best of luck!

Hello Karol,

Also, you could try: http://www.digitalcanal.com/structural/windeval.htm , though the software is a trial-only.  You might use it for your project on a trial basis, whether or not you intend to purchase it.

I?m attaching some other general wind pressure literature I happened to have on my hard drive.

Hello Jeremiah....
I tried the rebuild option also but the problem is the Same and "as it is".
After applying the rebuild option I adjusted the partition walls to make
the Zone correct but this time all zone comes under this problem. So,please
give your suggestions...

An idea-
Try to change your adjacency back to "Auto" then see if your file will run,
if so try to switch back to adiabatic. This will uncover if the adjacency
is the problem or if it is something else.

Subject: [Bldg-sim]  EE4 (DOE-2.1E) Water-Side Economizer Issue
Message-ID: <41FB03A1335B4955AEE77F52455535FB@MRENG.local>

Hello,

 

-I am looking to simulate a water-side economizer in EE4 (DOE-2.1E) by
altering the .doe file.

-I have added the highlighted text below into the "Plant-Parameters" section
of the .doe file.

 

 

PLANT-PARAMETERS

      BOILER-CONTROL     = STANDBY

      HW-BOILER-HIR     = 1.0870

      CHILLER-CONTROL    = STANDBY

$ Cooling Tower $

      TWR-SETPT-CTRL     = FIXED

      TWR-SETPT-T        = 85.0

      TWR-DESIGN-WETBULB = 73.0

      TWR-DESIGN-APPROACH= 12.0

      TWR-DESIGN-RANGE   = 10.0

      TWR-THROTTLE       = 5

      TWR-CAP-CTRL    = ONE-SPEED-FAN

      TWR-CELL-CTRL      = MIN-CELLS

      DIRECT-COOL-MODE = STRAINER-CYCLE

      DC-MAX-OAT = 39.0

      DC-MAX-CHILL-WTR-T = 44.0

      DC-TWR-WTR-SETPT = 44.0

      DIRECT-COOL-KW = 0.055

$ Condenser Water Pumps $

      TWR-MOTOR-EFF      = 0.917

      TWR-IMPELLER-EFF   = 0.790

      TWR-PUMP-HEAD      = 60.00

 ..

 

 

 

-After running the simulation and comparing it to previous results, there
are savings on "Space Cooling" but there is also a greater energy usage in
"Heat Reject" as show in the table below.  The DOE-2 guide suggests entering
the condenser water pumping power as kW/ton but maybe I should be entering 0
for DIRECT-COOL-KW if I'm accounting for the condenser water pumps twice?
This is for a project in Nova Scotia so I think there should be savings from
turning off the chillers throughout the winter but it doesn't make sense
based on these results.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] EE4 (DOE-2.1E) Water-Side Economizer Issue

 From the DOE2.1E Supplement:
DIRECT-COOL-KW
specifies the electrical input to direct cooling auxiliary equipment.
The default varies according to the direct cooling mode.
IT DIRECT-COOL-MODE = THERMO-CYCLE, you should
specify DIRECT-COOL-KW as kW /ton of operating capacity
for the period during which the compression chillers are operating
in this mode. The chiller electrical input is assumed to be
DIRECT-COOL-KW multiplied by the operating capacity
and the fraction of the hour the chiller ran. If
DIRECT-COOL-MODE = STRAINER-CYCLE, you should
specify DIRECT-COOL-KW as the electrical input to the
condenser water pumps (and other added equipment), calculated
as kW /ton of SYSTEMS peak cooling load. Usually, this
value is zero as the chilled water pumps are assumed to provide
all motive energy. If a heat exchanger is used to isolate the
tower from the chilled water loop, then this value should be
non-~ero to model the condenser pumping energy. In this case,
the condenser water pumping energy is calculated using the
value of DIRECT-COOL-KW as the kW per ton of the design
SYSTEMS load. (Fluid flow to the tower is assumed to be the
design chilled water flowrate). For both modes of direct cooling,
THERMO-CYCLE and STRAINER-CYCLE, the chilled
water pumps are assumed to run as usual.

Proj-14 is a study of infiltration in tall buildings. http://bepan.info/proj-bldgs/p-14-tall-bldg-press   Typically these mixed-use buildings are residential (operable windows) at the top and commercial (fixed windows) at the bottom.
All the case studies in the website were created for teaching and to demostrate design options & issues only.  The studies are basic and not intensive or exhaustive.  We (with help of A-E design firms) have been talking about starting again from scratch.  Issues are copyrights, free access to website etc.  The emphasis is on education that emphasize practice.  See obectives http://bepan.info/contents  and downloadable items 1 to 7.
Energy savings is high when it operates during the day and uses renewable energy (daylight, GSHP, PV. passive solar, etc.). Energy savings is low for high-rise bldgs in urban areas.  See article http://bepan.info/articles   ?2 - VCT - Mechanical-Design and Percent-Energy-Savings?
Proj-13 shows why commercial buildings use electricity for winter heating. http://bepan.info/proj-bldgs/p13-high-rise-bldg   
Proj-12 shows how a low-rise bldg on a large lot can save 50% energy.  http://bepan.info/proj-bldgs/p12-middle-school   
Proj-12 is based on Proj-11 which is LEED Platinum.  http://bepan.info/proj-bldgs/p11-ccgt-doe21e
The following projects (Proj-2 to Proj-5) demonstrates why the perimeter zone depth for dayligting can be over 25 feet. See article http://bepan.info/articles   ?1 - VCT - Architectural-Design and Perimeter-Zoning-Depth??

Proj-7 is intended to compare plant options for a office bldg http://bepan.info/projequest/p7-office-plant
Proj-8 is an attempt at modeling the LEED Platinum CCGT Bldg (Proj-11 in DOE2.1E) with eQUEST.  Renewable energy modeling is not correct.  http://bepan.info/projequest/p8-ccgt-pv-gshp

I am modelling a VRF system in eQUEST for a LEED certification. I have used
the PDF suggested by the mailing list  and created the model, but I would
like to compare some things, partly because I see no results in the eQUEST

Hi folks,

I originally posted this on the Society of Building Science Educators list serve, and thought I'd solicit the Bldg-Sim community perspective as well. Thanks in advance for any advice.

-------------

I'm prepping a few courses for CU this year and I'm keen to re-examine the options for whole-building analysis software for young architecture students. I realize this general topic has been the subject of many prior threads (and I'm grateful for the?EERE?Building Energy Software Tools Directory),?but each academic application has unique quirks and objectives, and I thought I'd post this query to see if anyone has undergone an?analogous?evaluation and selection process. Our department is in a bit of flux right now, but thankfully headed in a more 'integrative design' direction, so its a good opportunity for us to push building science principles and design performance assessment. Getting the right tool(s) in our labs will be an important step in the process. With apologies for the lengthy text, here's some context and requirements to address:

Academic context:
	* Students are undergrads?in an architectural / environmental design?curriculum??
	* Applicable courses will include both electives and studios
	* Courses will focus generally on climate-sensitive building design
	* Courses will stress holistic systems thinking and appropriate corollary analysis to inform design
	* Due to some poor degree planning, in the near term many of the students will have no formal building systems training (I know, it's tragic....)

Software objectives:
While we all use multiple tools professionally, and I know the likely scenario is to procure a suite of programs to cover the bases for varying courses, the focus of this email is on identifying (if there is one) the best whole-building multi-purpose analysis tool to serve as our fundamental software of choice for the next few years. The core needs are:
	* A tool that can be taught to beginners

	* A tool that allows for simple but competent exploration of passive strategies?

	* A tool that students can use to investigate the interplay of climate, envelope, loads, and systems

	* A tool robust enough to stay relevant through subsequent courses with advancing rigor?(a tool they can grow with)

	* Compatibility with popular CAD/3D tools (Sketchup, Revit, Rhino


Analysis requirements / desired features?(we can dream, right?):

	* Climate data viewing (we can supplement w/ 'Climate Consultant' for details, but some visualization would be good)
	* Capable of free-mode analysis with cogent load assessment outputs
	* Competent solar / mass-storage analysis (this requirement has killed our interest in Ecotect in previous years)
	* Real-time visualization of solar geometry / shading
	* Radiant load visualization capabilities (something we like about Ecotect :)
	* Competent daylighting analysis algorithms & daylight autonomy (don't need ray-tracing, but are there any whole building sim-tools with radiosity and visualization?)
	* Standard suite of default HVAC systems with clear interface / toggle options
	* Reasonably detailed HVAC system options for further study
	* Radiant conditioning options
	* GSHP modeling
	* Natural ventilation (presume we'd need a separate CFD package if desired)
	* Double skinned facades
	* Multi-zone analysis and zone-isolation capabilities

	* Clear parametric analysis capabilities (w variants), and good management / graphic outputs
	* Renewable energy systems analysis (at least reasonably robust)
	* Net zero / grid wheeling parameters
	* Carbon / emissions assessment -- access to regional utility grid source profiles
	* Life cycle cost analysis
	* probably prefer an E+ engine

Example packages under consideration:
	* Bentley AECOsim
	* BEOpt (concerned about zone limitations)
	* Design Advisor?
	* Design Builder
	* IES-VE
	* LESOSAI (?)
	* Open Studio
	* TAS
	* Vasari?
	* Others? ....what are we missing?
We're aware of some of the general assets and limitations of the tools above (and their kin), and obviously no tool can do it all, so perhaps we're asking too much. I'm still expecting that a suite of tools is?ultimately?where we're headed. But we'd be keen to hear the experience of others in making similar purchase / utilization assessments for academic applications.....perhaps people have experimented and feel there's a clear choice for our situation? Or maybe people have thoughts on which tools to aggregate most effectively? ....It's such a difficult balance between rigor and?accessibility-for-beginners, and so often what works well for professionals in the field is not the best choice for the classroom. But we also don't want to teach students tools that become largely obsolete by the time they graduate....?

Grateful for your thoughts....

Kind regards,

Adam

Hi All!

I hope this message finds you well! My name is Melissa Terry, a Manager with Intrax Internships. We run an international internship program in the Bay Area. Recently one of our Architectural Engineering candidates requested we reach out to your Architectural networks regarding potential internship positions available at your organization or of someone you may know.

Please find the application of Mr. Ji Yong Park: Ji Young is an architectural engineering student from South Korea with some experience with 3-D modeling, computer modeling and construction. He's particularly interested in focusing on his architectural engineering design skills with Building Information Modeling or Photocad. He's had some construction experience with Hyundai. He also had a American engineering professor, and has been exposed to English engineering vocabulary and US engineering plan styles. Ji Yong says that his strengths are his diligence and his ability to be a good team member. He is a strong English speaker.

Intrax Internships<http://www.intraxinc.com/host-companies/internships> is a U.S. Department of State designated organization that connects US organizations with young professionals through educational training-based cultural exchange programs. We are not recruiters, and there is no charge for our services.

Because we are a designated sponsor of the J1 visa for all interns participating in our program I do need to gather some basic information regarding your organization. If you or anyone you may know would be interested in interviewing this candidate, or seeing more candidates, please let me know.

Thank you so much in advance for your consideration, and looking forward to hearing from you!

Warmly,
Melissa

To: Bldg-sim at lists.onebuilding.org


Hello All...
I am using the design Builder for simulation, in this I am facing the
problem of "Manage Sizing" which interrupt the simulation process.The
Warning is showing that"Warning ** ManageSizing: For a zone sizing
run, there must be at least 1 Sizing:Zone input object.
SimulationControl Zone Sizing option ignored."I tried to remove this
by going to the "Model Option".
 It also shows the error of Time step which i changed by clicking on
the Model option. But the first one is not solved .

Hi Leen,

 

Unless they are using particular spec equipment you have to use normal
domestic profiles and load/gain profiles surely.  The passive house is just
the fabric and servicing strategy.  The occupants, unless they are eco-wise
will be the same normal heavily consuming people in standard houses
probably.  Sorry for the cynicism, but come across it all the time.

 

Regards

Paul

Dear all,

I am modeling a ground exchanger in a sand soild, depth 2 meter in the
moderate climate of Belgium. The fluid is a water glycol (30%) mixture. Is
there anyone who has data I can use for validation?

Thanks!

Message-ID: <CAHA4r_=t+-XLcNxg5=1hAfBbd2x6nkh4CYYFb4U3gqfgCyOC+w@mail.gmail.com>

Although I agree often in practice passive house occupants can and do use
wasteful appliances and end up with standard loads the answer you are
looking for us in the PHPP excel sheets. You use the internal loads sheet
to put in your fridge, lights etc. specific to the project.

I've seen papers written where developers refunded a deposit if the clients
bought energy efficient appliances. Have to admit seeing data on large
plasma tvs causing huge energy consumption as well.

If you don't have access to phpp please reply to me offline there is a
released copy that might have the data you want online I don't have the
link in front of me. Right now.

Leen,
I think that the requirement is 15 kBtu/sqft/Y for heating & cooling- and
.06 ACH50 maximum.
Possibly you will find the attached spreadsheet useful, as well as the
values pasted below (these are from a project that meet/exceed the standard)

All the best-

    Specific Space Heat Demand: 4.63 kBTU/(ft?yr)  Pressurization Test
Result: 0.45 ACH50    Specific Primary Energy Demand
(DHW, Heating, Cooling, Auxiliary and Household Electricity): 33.3
kBTU/(ft?yr)  Specific Primary Energy Demand
(DHW, Heating and Auxiliary Electricity): 14.4 kBTU/(ft?yr)  Specific
Primary Energy Demand
Energy Conservation by Solar Electricity:   kBTU/(ft?yr)  Heating Load:
4.73 BTU/(ft2hr)  Frequency of Overheating:   %    Specific Useful Cooling

Subject: [Bldg-sim] DES system selection in Baseline
Message-ID: <42584D297D51BD46BA705C95A140AC673DC95D7B@MBX022-E1-NJ-2.exch022.domain.local>

Happy Monday all,

I have a question regarding the LEED DES guidelines. I am modeling a high rise residential tower in the Middle East. The Proposed model has electric heating, therefore a System type 2 was selected for the Baseline residential zones. The project initially had an onsite chilled water plant, but is now going to be connected to an offsite CEP.

Page 11 of DES guidelines says that the Baseline System type 2 shall be converted to a 4 pipe FCU with HW boiler heat - which is a fuel switch for heating! Is that correct? and if it is, do we have to switch fuel in the Proposed Case as well?

Any comments will be welcome.

Thank you

Madhav

Leen,

 

Are you looking for software to perform the simulation or typical results
for a "sanity check"?  

 

If it's the latter, here is a document based on light commercial and
residential buildings - it may not apply to your building.

Dear all,

 

I am modeling a ground exchanger in a sand soild, depth 2 meter in the
moderate climate of Belgium. The fluid is a water glycol (30%) mixture. Is
there anyone who has data I can use for validation?

 

Thanks!

In SI, the main Passivhaus criteria are:

    * 15kWh/(m2.annum) space specific heating energy or 10W/m2 peak
      heating load. This does NOT include energy used in hot water,
      cooling, fans, pumps and receptacle loads. However, gains from
      these loads can offset heating energy
    * 120kWh/(m2.annum) primary energy (DOES include Hot water, cooling,
      fans, pumps and receptacle loads)
    * N50 < 0.6ACH
    * + a bunch of stuff on limiting u-values and thermal comfort

In answer to your original question (and depending on how pedantic you 
want to be) I can recommend:

    * PHPP already has some good default values (I thin)
    * The energy star website can be used for computers and peripherals
      http://www.eu-energystar.org/en/en_007.shtml
    * If you have a copy of the CIBSE TM22 worksheet (let me know if you
      don't) you can quickly assess other electrical loads using Nominal
      power, utilisation and operational hours in the "SysPlant" tab
    * For energy labelled goods you could also try the pdfs available at
      http://ec.europa.eu/energy/efficiency/labelling/labelling_en.htm
      they contain details of how the energy labels are derived under
      standard conditions. Some of the terms will probably be a bit
      vague to follow

Cheers

Chris

I?m Italian and I am
not particularly familiar with the English lexicon to define HVAC systems. I?m
dealing with my first work of energy simulation for LEED certification. I?m
looking for a guide that explains the characteristics of the HVAC systems that
are listed in tables G3.1.1A and G3.1.1B of ASHRAE 90.1:2007. I would like to
find an explanation that represents the different HVAC systems also through
schematic graphic representation.

You can get an explanation of US hvac terms here: 
http://wiki.ashrae.org/index.php/ASHRAEwiki

    * descriptions hold true for most English speaking countries with
      some nuances
    * it's not comprehensive but is evolving
