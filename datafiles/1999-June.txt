Subject: [BLDG-SIM] DOE2 complex walls
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F199906300309.AA090792MD55924@gard.com>

Dear List

In France we have a hollow brick blocks that are used for wall
construction.
The brick block can be up to 37,5 cm or wider and have 19 voids ie 20
walls of brick each 9-10mm wide.The cross walls are offset to reduce
thermal bridging so at no point even on the ends are there continuos
cross walls. 
This has been tested by the CSTB and wall value including plaster inside
and outside of  u (k) value 0,46W/m2.K established. I want to take into
account the thermal mass effect with the DOE2 program so do not want to
specify just by its k value but instead by its properties/layers. With
such a thermally complex form to simply specify it as 39 layers would
not be correct.

Your comments on how to model this type of wall will be most
appreciated.

To follow-up on a previous discussion of the modeling of buildings
that incorporate ground loop heat pump systems, I have attached a
figure from overall results of recent work at Oak Ridge National Laboratory
using DOE-2.  I received these results today; they were sent to me by their
author, Howard McLain.  More detail is available in Howard's complete
ASHRAE paper on this topic and I expect there will be further ORNL
publications on his work.  Questions on the work should be sent to
Howard at the address in the attachment; I can answer question on DOE-2
specifics.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F199906241226.AA260660MD54691@gard.com>

I just wanted to thank all of those that participated in the discussion of 
this subject.  There was certainly a diverse and talented group of responders.

If I reached any conclusion, it's that there is, in certain situations at 
least, a statistical component to estimating peak demand that is not easily 
considered with typical engineering methods.  I do not know the relative 
magnitude of this statistical component; in most cases it is undoubtedly 
minor.  However, in cases where several zones see peak demand at the same 
time, and these zones are served by cycling rather than unloading equipment, 
it may be important.

Thanks again for the responses.

Bill

Version 088 and later of DOE-2.1E calculates inside surface temperatures,
zone mean radiant temperature and zone operative temperature (average of
zone air temp and zone mean radiant temp). This was added in 1995
by Markus Koschenz of EMPA (Switzerland).

The following paragraphs should help clarify the
issues raised in your message, including:
- Documentation status,
- Ground loop heat pump modeling, and
- The ?legal dispute? between J.J. Hirsch &
  Associates (JJH) & LBNL

1. DOE-2/PowerDOE documentation and program status

DOE-2.2 documentation is available, more
comprehensive than for any prior versions of DOE-2,
and complete except for a final review for errors
and changes. The PowerDOE online help file was
completed in early 1997 and includes help on all
DOE-2.2 commands and keywords with the exception of
a small number of mistaken omissions. A draft
version of the DOE-2.2 manuals was produced jointly
by LBNL and JJH and first made available in June
1998 as part of the then current pre-release of DOE-
2.2; LBNL has done a great job in reorganizing and
formatting the scattered DOE-2 documents into a new
set of three manuals. We expect to complete the
final review for errors and changes within the next
three months and make final versions of the
documentation for PowerDOE and DOE-2.2 available at
that time. Draft versions are available now.

Likewise, PowerDOE version 1 and DOE-2.2 pre-
releases are available to anyone and in widespread
use.  Free trial copies, updates, and documentation
can be downloaded upon execution of a no-cost pre-
release testing license. PowerDOE is designated as
pre-release until the final documentation review is
complete. DOE-2.2 is also pre-release for this
reason, and because implementation, beyond internal
test versions, is not complete on some batch
execution features, the metric input/output,
functions, and parametric input commands. This work
is also planned for completion within the next three
months.

Of course, ongoing debugging is an integral part of
supporting PowerDOE and DOE-2.2. Nevertheless, any
existing user would be far better off upgrading to
DOE-2.2 or PowerDOE. DOE-2.2 has better
documentation, fewer bugs, better input and
modeling, better documentation, and runs faster.
PowerDOE has full interactive building description,
simulation execution, and results fetching. Also
available is a developer?s kit which includes: a set
of DOE-2.2 32-bit DLLs, a sample driver program, and
interface documentation to assist in developing
interactive applications based on DOE-2.2
simulations.

2. Ground loop heat pump modeling in DOE-2.1E, DOE-
2.2, and PowerDOE

We first released a version of DOE-2.1E with ground
loop heat pump modeling capabilities in 1995; this
was known as DOE-2.1E version 110.  DOE-2.2 contains
the same basic ground heat-exchanger model with
enhancements to allow the definition of multiple
well/trench ?fields.?  When we first released 2.1E
with this feature, we placed a warning into the
manual that we considered this feature in the test
phase; this is no longer the case as extensive
testing and comparisons with measured results has
been completed and show the model to be reliable and
accurate within acceptable bounds.

Davis Energy Group, or their funding agency Pacific
Gas and Electric, could be consulted for more
details on the extensive DOE-2 vs. measurements
comparisons for GLHP systems recently completed. The
most significant issue identified in the testing was
that the model tends to over-predict the daily swing
of the field return temperature during the peak
heating and/or cooling days by as much as 10 percent
(typically, about 5 degrees F.)  Thus the DOE-2
results would tend to cause over sizing of the
field.  The energy predictions, non peak
performance, and longer term (monthly) load
predictions are very good and not significantly
effected by this issue.

Howard McLain, at ORNL, is finishing a smaller,
single building study.  He also identified that the
model does well for overall predictions and also for
the details of temperature tracking during the non-
peak days but also saw larger deviations in field
return temperature predictions for the worst case
peak days.  There are several items about this study
that raise more questions than it provides answers.
Both these studies suggest, however, that we need to
improve the near field (short term) dynamics of the
model before it can be used for sizing if better
than 10% accuracy is required; such accuracy is
normally not an issue but the expense of ground loop
heat exchangers is relatively high so as to make 10%
oversizing undesirable.

Note however, that DOE-2 does not perform default
sizing calculations for well/trench fields; you must
use other means to calculate the number and depth of
bores, etc., and provide this information to the
program. We have been seeking funding to add sizing
calculations but cannot say when they may be
available; so far, it has not been a priority for
funding. One item that is important and different in
2.2 from 2.1E: the specification of circulation loop
min/max alarm temperatures (the temperature range
outside of which attached equipment is not allowed
to operate so as to prevent equipment damage.)  In
2.2, for GLHP systems it is important to specify
these in such a way so as to allow ?extended range?
units attached to the loop to operate; for example,
use values of 20 and 130 and they will have no
influence.  This has been the most common problem
that users of DOE-2.2 have encountered; we will need
to implement documentation or default value changes
to help remove this common input error.

The DEG/PG&E work also resulted in our adding
several new features to the DOE-2 GLHP model:
subhour loop operation, cooling towers in parallel
with GLHX field, packaged air-handlers allowed as
GLHP systems rather than just HP unitary systems,
among others.

Included in the DOE-2.2 manuals and the PowerDOE
help is a complete description of the ground loop
heat exchanger model as well as documentation on
WLHP circulation loop and water source heat pump
description options. This information is based upon,
and an expansion of, the DOE-2.1E documentation on
the subject which is divided between the 2.1E
reference manual, the 2.1E Supplement, and the JJH
2.1E-110 enhancements document.  Both PowerDOE help
and the DOE-2.2 manuals unify all the scattered DOE-
2.1E manuals into a single set; a vast improvement.
In the PowerDOE help you simply search for the
"ground loop" phrase, or on a GLHX (or related)
screen just right mouse click on the item and select
item or topic help.  In the DOE-2.2 Command and
Keyword Dictionary you just look in the table of
contents for ground loop heat exchanger, circulation
loop, and system; in the Topics manual just look in
the TOC under system TYPE HP.  If something is
missing from these sections please let us know the
specifics so we can fix the problem.

In summary, there does not exist a fast, easy-to-
use, and inexpensive GLHX model that can do better
than DOE-2 at this time; the DOE-2 model input is
comparatively simple, an annual simulation on a mid-
speed Pentium II is a few seconds, and the program
costs a couple hundred dollars (compared to other
more detailed models that require significantly more
expertise to use, have runtimes from ten minutes to
an hour for a well, and cost thousands to license.)
The more detailed research grade models are very
important tools and should continue to be supported
and developed; their development has lead to
important contributions to the literature that has
been key in the development of the commercially
viable programs such as those based on DOE-2 as well
as those offered by various equipment manufacturers.
Having a range of tools requiring differing levels
of expertise as well as offering varying levels of
detail of analysis is a good situation that will
lead to wider adoption of building energy and
performance modeling within the design community.

A few added comments about user support and the
frustration you expressed.  Software like DOE-2 is
complex due to the large number of options and
capabilities.  We realize that it is often difficult
to fully understand even the best and most robust
documentation. We usually hear from people using
DOE-2 based products when they are having problems;
if they obtained their license from JJH we deal with
them as quickly as possible and if a program bug is
suspected we give the issue priority independent of
their license source. It is impossible to help
people if we are not informed of a problem. DEG was
in constant contact and we dealt with their issues
on an ongoing basis. Many other users contact us
daily with questions and issues; most would say they
get excellent support and issues get resolved more
quickly than with other similar software products.
Of course, we cannot help if we do not know the
issue, the issue is presented as a vague flame, or
competing product advocates make vague statements to
bolster their favored product. We want to help, and
are willing, to a point, to move past your
frustration produced flame but you must provide
specific and detailed explanations of the problems
before we can address them.  The best thing to do is
zip up you input files (.inp and .pdp, and weather
if not ours) and email with a description of the
problem including the exact version of DOE-2 you are
using.  We are, of course, limited by available
resources, but our goal is to provide the best
possible products and to learn from users
experiences and problems to continually improve DOE-
2 and its derivatives.

3. The ?Legal Dispute? Between LBNL and JJH

Unfortunately, the information you received from
LBNL was not entirely accurate. As noted above,
documentation is currently available and has been
for some time.

Regarding the ?legal dispute,? the real problem is
changed focus at  DOE, and thus LBNL, from DOE-2
development to EnergyPlus development. All
contractual, licensing, and distributions rights to
DOE-2.2 are clearly specified in a contract between
LBNL and JJH and further clarified in a supplemental
written agreement signed by DOE, LBNL, and JJH in
June 1997. These documents provide DOE, LBNL, and
JJH all rights needed to ensure that current and
future versions of DOE-2 will be available, on a
non-preferential basis, to anyone and at a lower
cost than was previously possible.  JJH has and will
continue to strictly follow the letter and intent of
these agreements.

The problem is that these agreements provide the
framework for continuing development, support, and
use of DOE-2.2 (and future versions). Instead,
current DOE program manager is focused on justifying
and increasing annual investment in EnergyPlus. A
constantly improving, expanding, vital, open,
inexpensive and more available DOE-2 (at little or
no expense to the Government) hinders efforts of
this DOE program manager to convince Congress to
continue funding the DOE-2 ?replacement? project?at
an ever increasing cost.  For this reason, work LBNL
committed to undertake on DOE-2.2 was not completed.
Further, the DOE program manager would prefer to
hinder JJH?s ongoing privately funded efforts to
develop and deliver new DOE-2 versions?even though
JJH has given DOE and LBNL perpetual royalty free
rights to directly distribute new versions to the
public. Accordingly, a delay in the initial DOE-2.2
release ensued. And, because JJH and its partners
are committed to supporting, improving, and
developing new versions of DOE-2, we are at
loggerheads.

The technology transfer effort for DOE-2 has
otherwise been a model of success, with the private
sector taking the lead to develop and distribute
products like VisualDOE, EZ-DOE, DOE-Plus, PowerDOE,
eQuest, and others. The results of all Government-
sponsored and JJH privately-sponsored DOE-2
development will continue to be available to
developers at minimal cost.  Fortunately, as a
result of this successful transfer, most of the
expertise and all necessary rights for continuing
development of DOE-2 are now equally in the private
sector. Although LBNL?s contributions to DOE-2 have
continued to be excellent, creative, and ground
breaking, their percentage contribution to DOE-2 has
been declining since JJH began its significant
private sector effort in 1988. JJH produced over 60%
of the new code for the initial 2.1E and over 75% of
the new code for DOE-2.2. JJH and its partners and
licensees can and will continue developing new DOE-2
based products, though we regret the loss of what
was a long and productive collaboration with LBNL.

The change in focus at DOE is very disappointing, as
is the DOE program managers attitude that only DOE
can facilitate the development of quality building
simulation software. This attitude is unproductive
and not supported in fact. Although I believe that
the EnergyPlus team is talented and that their
efforts will indeed make some useful and valuable
contributions to building simulation, I also believe
the project would contribute significantly more and
lead to greater advancements in the field if its
HVAC simulation development effort were based upon
the knowledge, expertise, and experience of the
TRNSYS, HVACSIM+, SPARK, DOE-2, and other HVAC
simulation development efforts undertaken during the

Perhaps posting this response will help clear up the
misinformation. The focus should be on what helps
people make buildings more efficient, and instead we
are mired in DOE and national lab politics.

Mark:

I am not sure this reference has the specific data you are looking for,
but try ASHRAE Cooling and Heating Load Calculation Manual, Second
Ed.     All types of institutional appliances are listed and the heat
output is broken down by appliance size, capacity, hooded or not, etc.
Possibly one could work backwards from the BtuH output ratings to
determine energy source input.

Hope this helps.

Personally, I would consider the question below a building 
simulation issue.  Judgment on end-use intensities is one 
of the most common reasonableness checks that building 
simulation users have.  Another reasonableness check is 
sensitivity analysis - temporarily altering major input 
assumptions and making sure the building responds in a way 
that makes sense by checking annual and peak electricity 
and gas usage.  These checks are both based on engineering 
judgment like most reasonableness checks.  

What other reasonableness checks are the list members using 
when doing building simulations?   What other quality 
assurance techniques are the list members using?

You are not the only one that has had problems with the ground source
models in DOE-2.  Oak Ridge National Labs and our company (TESS) has just
finished a "simulation calibration to data" exercise of TRNSYS and DOE-2 on
a school in Lincoln Nebraska.  Howard McClain of ORNL has just published a
paper on his findings with the DOE-2 gshp model and they are not real good
(ASHRAE paper).  The results from TRNSYS using the DST ground heat
exchanger model from the University of Lund Sweden were excellent.  Richard
Gordon of AEMT in Corvallis Oregon has also struggled with the GHP routines
in DOE-2.

For the past several years we have modeled gshp systems in TRNSYS for a
variety of projects including:

1) Apartment level simulations at Fort Polk LA - the largest GHP project in
the world.
2) Feeder level calibrations/simulations (200 apartments) for Fort Polk
that predict the annual energy usage within 1% of that measured at the site.
3) Residential GHP calibrations for northern climates
4) Simulations used as the government estimates of GHP savings for a
large-scale retrofit at Oceana Naval Air Station
5) Simulations used as the government estimates of GHP savings for a
large-scale retrofit at Little Creek Naval Amphibious Base
6) Calibration to data at 4 schools in Lincoln Nebraska.
7) Calibration to data at Daniel Boone High School (TN) - in progress

Several of these projects used the DOE-2 building loads from a separate
firm and we were tasked with doing the system simulations.  I have several
reports and papers (some to be published at future ASHRAE meetings) if
anyone is interested in our findings.  The results in terms of energy
consumption, 15-minute peak demand, and max/min entering water temperatures
to the heat pumps are very close to those measured - even with the loss of
accuracy encountered by using "energy-rate" loads from DOE-2 (and ignoring
the system/building interactions that TRNSYS could handle).

As a result of the calibration exercise at a school in Lincoln Nebraska, we
have measured data of 54 separate ground source heat pumps for a period of
three years at the school.  If anyone is intersted in comparing their
statistical predictions with reality at this school, e-mail me and I can
give you the details of the building/system.  The simulation of this
building and its heat pumps is performed at 15-minute timesteps in TRNSYS
such that the demand can be estimated more accurately and the thermal
"fighting" between adjacent heat pumps in this "open architecture" school
can be studied.  We have since made a software "movie" of the fighting
between the adjacent zones over the period of a typical year and the
results are fascinating.  I can send the program to anyone who wishes to
see it.  With the simulation in place, lots of "what if" scenarios can be
studied including some recent work on the demand effects of night
setback/setup.

Thanks.

While all versions of DOE-2 use an hourly calculational timestep, DOE-2.2
contains a refinement that allows the program to better approximate the subhour
demands associated with packaged rooftop equipment.   As in previous versions,
the program calculates DX unit's energy consumption using an hourly timestep.
Then, the program looks at the zonal temperature profile that occurred during
the hour, and allocates the energy consumption into 5-minute bins according to
the variation of zone temperature within the cooling setpoint throttling range.

For example, consider a zone's behavior during the first hour of operation
(morning startup).  If the temperature at the beginning of the hour is above
the top of the zone's temperature setpoint throttling range, and the
temperature at the end of the hour is within the throttling range, then clearly
the unit must have been running continuously at the beginning of the hour, and
is cycling on/off at the end of the hour.  The program therefore allocates more
of the hourly energy into the 5-minute bins at the beginning of the hour, and
less to the bins at the end of the hour.

This allocation assumes the temperature change within the hour is linear, which
is a reasonable assumption for most equipment (it becomes less accurate for
equipment that is significantly oversized).

The electric utility rate calculations can take into account either fixed or
sliding demand windows, of variable length, with the smallest possible window
being 5 minutes, and the longest being 60 minutes.

The above applies to packaged rooftop equipment serving either single or
multiple zones, and for both heating and cooling.  This logic has not been
extended to central plant equipment (boilers, chillers).

I am one of the original authors of the DOE-2 program, and have been affiliated
with J. Hirsch & Associates since 1992.  I also have 10 years of experience in
designing HVAC systems, and in the configuration and programming of DDC
controls.  Jeff and I are responsible for the majority of the new mechanical
system simulation capabilities implemented in DOE-2.2, including the above.

The more cycling units you have, the LESS probable it is that they will all be on
constantly during a 15 minute demand window, when compared to a single unit. A
single cycling unit is more likely to cause an un-predicted peak above its hourly
average demand.

During a DSM evaluation project we tried to calibrate many basic DOE-2.1
simulations with monthly utility demand and consumption data. Some of the best
"behaved" buildings were big box retail stores with 20+ packaged units (and some
other characteristics that make them easy to simulate).

DOE-2.2 does have some capapabilities to account for sub-hourly HVAC demands,
even though it is an hourly simulation. I have not used these yet, however.

I had a retrofit project in which I also had "2 years of chiller data and 
coincident weather data"  This was a large hospital, and I WAS able to come 
up with a series of equations to model the cooling load based on outdoor air 
parameters.  My spreadsheet model was evaluated by the P.E. for the local 
utility, and we obtained a $180,000 rebate based solely on my model.  

So now we have 2 anecdotes.  Neither of us is right or wrong in the 
reasonabless of simulating a facility based mostly on OSAT.  I happened to 
have a particularly consistent building.   I'm guessing you didn't.  Also, 
the building I was looking was relatively unaffected by day-of-the-week, 
holidays, etc.

I couldn't agree more.  But my concern is that our *best* sim programs 
already include big simplifications in this regard.

Thanks for responding to my post...this is most educational, and making me 
think!

Yes, that is partly why I brought this issue up.

Absolutely, for an individual A/C unit.  But I am concerned with the case for 
which the impact of the load and ambient T on equipment cycling, efficiency, 
and capacity have already been accounted.

That makes sense, because there is (nearly) always the possibility that all 
units could be on at once.  (Conversely the probability that the all of the 
units will NEVER be on at the same time is < 1.)

However, for estimating peak demand by month, (on average, over a several 
year period) one might look at, for Pr =0.5, how many units would be on 
simultaneously for at least 15 minutes, or perhaps more units on for less 
than 15 minutes if that results in a greater 15-minute integrated demand.

So, I think I agree with you, except I think it is at least partly a 
statistics problem.  The biggest uncertainty I have is whether zonal load 
diversity has such a big impact on the peak kW (few of the units ever see 
peak demand at the same time, most months) that this type of statistical 
diversity becomes insignificant.  The zone load diversity impact is certainly 
dependent upon lots of factors, but my guess is that it does not always 
dominate the statistical diversity.  For example, many schools have little 
diversity between zones, especially if there are not east- or west-oriented 
windows.

Thanks for your response!  This is an interesting subject for me.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] DOE 2.2 experiences?
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F199906031207.AA073359MD49630@gard.com>

I've noticed a few people mentioning that they are using DOE 2.2.  We have
used it and PowerDOE on a couple of projects.  Our experience is that either
can be a bear to use if one is trying to do anything creative since there is
no documentation for the more advanced features (the reason one would use
DOE 2.2 vs. 2.1E v.127 in the first place).

We have been particularly frustrated with the ground source heat pump
algorithms.  After a week of getting inconsistent and unexplainable results,
a call down to LBNL revealed that the ground loop algorithms are
"unreliable" and "should not be used."  Instead, they recommended scheduling
water temperatures, which we eventually did.  The results still seem
optimistic, but at least the simulation is working somewhat predictably.

I heard that the documentation is done but is held up due to a legal dispute
between Jeff Hirsch and LBNL.  Unfortunate.

Anyone else have similar experiences with DOE 2.2/PowerDOE?  Any pointers as
to how to properly define water loops, or where we can get the documentation
to do so?

Thanks in advance.

BTW, as a 10 year user of DOE2, our frustration with using the undocumented
DOE 2.2 is akin to what was experienced when I first was learning DOE2.1C!

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F199906031217.AA172410MD49648@gard.com>

Mr. Koran,
     
At the end of your posting about demand calculations you asked how other 
simulation software including Carrier's HAP program handle this issue.  An 
explanation for HAP follows:
     
In HAP heat flow and equipment performance are calculated for a series of 8760 
1-hour time steps.  Variations in heat flow or equipment performance over 
intervals shorter than 60 minutes cannot be determined because of the lack of 
sufficient data - weather data, schedules, loads, etc... for shorter periods of 
time aren't available.  Therefore, hourly simulation results represent the 
integrated performance over a 1-hour period.  Another way of viewing the results
is as representing the average state of operation over the 1-hour period.  With 
this data the best estimate of demand that can be made is to assume steady 
consumption (e.g., 40 kWh consumed by a compressor during a 1-hour period 
equates to a steady 40 kW power level for the compressor for that hour). Similar
kW data is derived for all components in a building - fans, lights, office eqpt,
compressors, pumps, etc.. - to assemble the total building kW profile.  These 
profiles are then evaluated to identify the peak kW during each billing period. 
This can be interpreted as either assuming that the demand window is 60 minutes,
or that it is 15 minutes, but performance is steady for all 15 minute windows 
during each 1-hour time-step.
     
In real life, of course, thermal and equipment behavior changes in significant 
ways over periods of time shorter than one hour.  You've pointed out one example
- cycling of the DX unit and the effect it can have on demand determination.
     
Probably the only way to account for all the factors that affect demands set in 
a sliding 15-minute window is to use a short-time step simulation which looks at
time intervals much less than one hour.  I think one version of BLAST provides 
short time step simulations, but I don't know if it carries the analysis through
to determine peak demand.
     
If you use your statistical approach with hourly simulation data as raw 
material, there may be several factors beyond the ON/OFF status of the packaged 
DX units that are worth considering.  Over your 100 hour sample period the 
variations in the following may affect probabilities:
     
a. Varying outdoor air temperature which affects the capacity of the DX 
   equipment and influences the cycling rate of the equipment.  This in turn 
   affects the probability of units being on.
     
b. Varying outdoor air temperature also affects the efficiency of the unit and 
   thus influences kW use.
     
c. Varying building loads which affect the cycling rate of the equipment.
     
Hope this information is helpful.

This is a statistics problem.  I'm extremely competent with thermodynamics 
and most energy analysis, but I've only recently tried to estimate peak 
demand by month.  I can estimate the kW of an individual unit, but what is 
the expected peak kW during the month for a given number of similar units?
     
I'm very curious, how do hourly analysis program do this?  It's easy to see 
that they might not handle peak demand very well.
     
As I'm certain you're all aware, large businesses are
generally charged each month according to the highest electrical demand 
recorded over a 15-minute period.
     
Consider a site with number of packaged units for cooling.  The problem is to 
find out the maximum number of units that would be on at
simultaneously (for at least 15 minutes), so that the peak electrical demand 
and associated demand charges can be estimated.
     
N_units =number of units
A_pct   =fraction of time each unit is on
         during each time period considered
N_pers  =number of time periods to be considered 
A_Prob  =minimum acceptable probability of occurrence
     
For example, if I have 3 units, and each unit operates only 5 minutes each 
hour, the probability that all units are operating at once is low if I only 
look at 1 hour.  
     
However, if I consider 100 hours, the probability that all units are 
operating at once is much higher.
     
If I have a large number of units, the number of units likely to be 
operating simultaneously will approach the product of the total number of 
units times the fraction of time each unit is on.
     
I suppose I need to use a threshold probability to constrain the problem. 
So, with a probability greater than 70%, what is the maximum number of 
units operating simultaneously?  Even better, what is the maximum average 
number of units operating simultaneously over a 15-minute period?
     
How do DOE-2, Trace, HAP, BLAST, etc. calculate a 15-minute peak demand?

The energy simulation programs you mention don't calculate any variables in
15 minute intervals.  1 hour time slices are the standard.  DOE2 doesn't use
statistics*.  It takes a sledge hammer approach and sums up the coincident
loads from all the calculations it does.

I don't think you can estimate AC equipment demand with the statistics
variables you mention.  The number of AC units on at any time is a function
of the internal and external building loads, the thermal inertia of the
building and contents, and the equipment operating schedule set by the
building operator.

We had a project in which we had the good fortune of over 2 years of chiller
data and coincident weather data.  The goal was to come up with a series (a
minimal amount!) of equations by which we could predict a building's cooling
load based on outdoor air parameters.

We were not able to do it as there were too many inconsistencies and too
many variables.  e.g. so what if it is 100 F out if that occurs on a Sunday
when the building isn't occupied; or worse, a Monday that also just happens
to be a holiday.

It seems the more one tries to simplify a complex process, the more the
accuracy of the results are compromised.

I hope you fair better!  Good luck!

The biggest problem in predicting peaks is in the input data.  We use repeating
schedules of occupancy and equipment use, without statistical fluctuations.  We
use  weather data that may be statistically valid, but certainly won't coincide
with the occupancy schedules the way the real weather next year will coincide
with the real occupancy.

For these reasons, I have found that the deviations of predicted from measured
peak power are considerably greater than for annual or monthly energy
consumption.  I don't know a solution to the problem.

DOE-2.1E and BLAST do not do anything special to calculate subhourly
demand windows.  The electric consumption for the hour is averaged
over the hour.  As you said, this is a good approximation for larger
facilities with more than a few units, but it could underestimate
demand charges for facilities with a few units or in applications
where return from setback would cause all units to kick on at the
same time and run for say 30 minutes to cool down the facility.
Does anyone out there know whether Trace or HAP or DOE-2.2 have any
subhourly demand tracking capabilities?

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F199906031209.AA091789MD49644@gard.com>

I posted the question regarding a statistical estimate of peak kW.  I'll 
reply to some of the responses, but first, in response to the suggestion for 
info about posters:

Name:  Bill Koran (William E. Koran, PE if you want formalities)
Company: Honeywell Inc.
Title:  Performance Contracting Engineer
Work:  Mix of pre-retrofit energy analysis, post-retrofit M&V, and 
commissioning existing systems.
Time with Honeywell:  5 years
Prior Company: Portland Energy Conservation Inc.
Time with PECI: 5 years
Work:  Research-level DOE-2 modeling for BPA demonstration project, plus a 
little commissioning.  (I presented several papers on DOE-2 calibration and 1 
on building commissioning during my time with PECI-- at ASHRAE, BTECC, ACEEE, 
and NCBC.)
Prior Company:  Allied Signal Aerospace Company (AiResearch Mfg. Co.)
Time with AiResearch:  12 years
Work: Sizing and estimating the energy use of aircraft and spacecraft 
environmental control (HVAC) systems.

Regarding the post about peak kW estimates:  I am already estimating the kW 
of an individual unit based upon weather, schedules, etc.  The challenge is, 
for cycling or unloading equipment, to estimate a monthly aggregated peak kW 
for a number of units.  I believe this is a statistical problem, but 
regardless, my curiosity is how other people and software estimate this kW.  
It clearly can be a significant component of energy cost, and I'm still 
unclear as to whether it is well estimated, even for an average cost over a 
several year time period.

I am enjoying the responses, though.

Bill

Primitive?  On the contrary!  Text is best edited with a text
editor.  People who use word processors to edit text cause
themselves (and often others) considerable grief.

Thanks for sharing this information.  I use a different text
editor, but simply having the list of keywords is useful.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Statistical Estimate of Number of Units ON (peak demand)
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F199906021750.AA500451MD49347@gard.com>

This is a statistics problem.  I'm extremely competent with thermodynamics 
and most energy analysis, but I've only recently tried to estimate peak 
demand by month.  I can estimate the kW of an individual unit, but what is 
the expected peak kW during the month for a given number of similar units?

I'm very curious, how do hourly analysis program do this?  It's easy to see 
that they might not handle peak demand very well.

As I'm certain you're all aware, large businesses are
generally charged each month according to the highest electrical demand
recorded over a 15-minute period.

Consider a site with number of packaged units for cooling.  The problem is to 
find out the maximum number of units that would be on at
simultaneously (for at least 15 minutes), so that the peak electrical demand 
and associated demand charges can be estimated.

N_units	=number of units
A_pct	=fraction of time each unit is on
	 during each time period considered
N_pers	=number of time periods to be considered
A_Prob	=minimum acceptable probability of occurrence

For example, if I have 3 units, and each unit operates only 5 minutes each
hour, the probability that all units are operating at once is low if I only
look at 1 hour.  

However, if I consider 100 hours, the probability that all units are
operating at once is much higher.

If I have a large number of units, the number of units likely to be
operating simultaneously will approach the product of the total number of
units times the fraction of time each unit is on.

I suppose I need to use a threshold probability to constrain the problem. 
So, with a probability greater than 70%, what is the maximum number of
units operating simultaneously?  Even better, what is the maximum average
number of units operating simultaneously over a 15-minute period?

How do DOE-2, Trace, HAP, BLAST, etc. calculate a 15-minute peak demand?

BLD-SIMers,

I use a text editor to edit most of my DOE-2 input files (I 
know, its primitive but it works). One of the features that 
my text editor has is syntax coloring.  Over the last few 
years I have made a list of DOE-2 keywords so that the 
editor would show them as a different color.  The editor 
also has a way to show comment lines and numbers using 
different colors. The editor I used is called UltraEdit and 
below is the list and syntax needed.  

UltraEdit is shareware and runs on Windows 95 and NT.

   http://www.ultraedit.com

For UltraEdit, just add the text below to the WORDFILE.TXT 
file.  This may be useful to other text editors that do 
syntax coloring but the syntax will need to be modified.  
The list is far from complete, I add to it whenever I come 
across a keyword that isn't colored.  Anyone is welcome to 
use this but you should let me know so if it changes I can 
send you an update.  Also if you do use it and find missing 
keywords please send me an updated version.

Sorry for the confusion but we're looking for a seminar presentation at the
Dallas meeting. There isn't enough time to put together a symposium for
Dallas. If there is enough interest we will do a symposium at the summer
2000 meeting in Minneapolis.

Hi All

There are various programs approved by the CEC (California Energy Commision)
for performing Title 24 Residential calculations/certifications.  I was just
wondering if anyone knows of a side-by-side comparison of the features of
these programs, or better yet, if there is anyone out there who has actually
worked with all or most of these programs and could contrast/compare them.

Thanks!
