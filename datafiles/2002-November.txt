Group-
  I'm having difficulty with a project in PowerDOE.  Previously it work fine with some variable volume systems.  I recently changed them to Powered Induction Units to simulate some variables better.  
  Now though, the spreadsheets will not show up and the files become corrupted when I try to see them.  Has anyone seen this before and figured out why it happens?  If anyone could provide any help, I would appreciate it.
Thank you,

Subject: [bldg-sim] new IEA Annex on modelling fuel cell cogeneration systems
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200211281532.AA3239906pd80000223242@gard.com>

(Apologies for cross posting)

I am hoping to form a new Annex of the International Energy Agency's Energy
Conservation in Buildings and Community Systems programme (IEA-ECBCS).  This
Annex would focus on developing and validating models for simulating
residential fuel cell cogeneration systems.  The tentative list of tasks is
as follows:

1) Model development (SOFC, PEM, thermal cooling, hot and cold storage, fuel
processors, power conditioning systems, etc).
2) Characterization of electrical usage patterns.
3) Implementation of models into existing whole-building simulation
programs.
4) Validation of component models and their incorporation into
whole-building simulation programs.

The preliminary proposal for this Annex has been approved by IEA-ECBCS and a
number of member countries have expressed an interest in participating.  The
next step will be a workshop of potential Annex participants.  This workshop
will refine the scope of work, identify the roles of participating
countries, and produce a final project proposal.

Please contact me at your earliest convenience if you are interested in
participating in the workshop and/or the eventual IEA Annex work.  The
enclosed file provides some background and the workshop details.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200211271913.AA1306281pd80000222973@gard.com>

I apologize for multiple postings of this message.  Essentially the same
message was sent to a number of different exploders.

As you may know, IFC HVAC definitions have been extended to support
exchange among design and simulation applications.  The integration of
the HVAC extension schemata with the IFC core model is in progress right
now; the new version of the IFC data model (IFC2x2) that will include
these extensions will be released in May 2003.  Software implementation
of the new IFC2x2 model (based on the beta release) can start in three
months from now.  LBNL plans to follow that schedule and develop a
comprehensive IFC2x2 interface to EnergyPlus that will implement the new
IFC HVAC definitions.

The extended IFC HVAC model includes more than most HVAC and/or related
applications need to implement individually.  HVAC and related
developers need to agree which definitions need to implemented by *all*
implementations, and which need not be implemented.  In addition, they
need to agree how to commonly implement definitions that need to be
implemented.  In other words, there is a need to formulate implementers'
agreements for HVAC applications, similar to what IAI CAD developers did
for CAD implementations a few years ago.

HVAC implementers' agreements should provide the basis for HVAC data
exchange among more than just HVAC applications.  Critical application
developers from other related industry disciplines that also use HVAC
data (such as cost estimating, CAD, construction management, project
management and facilities management) should also participate in the
forging of HVAC implementers' agreements.

LBNL is organizing an HVAC developers' "round table" at LBNL offices in
Washington, DC on Friday, December 13.  HVAC related software developers
are also invited to this round table.  If West Coast developers cannot
travel to Washington, DC they can join a telecast of that meeting at
LBNL offices in Berkeley.  Alternatively, a limited number of phone
links to the meeting will be available free of charge for those who
cannot attend at either LBNL location.  The meeting will start promptly
at 11:00 EST and end at 14:00 EST.  Follow-up meetings, teleconferences,
and/or video conferences will be subsequently scheduled as needed.
Please let me know if, and at which site, you can attend this meeting.

You can download the new IFC HVAC extensions schemata for IFC2x2 from
the BS-8 project web site.  The URL is
http://iaiweb.lbl.gov/bs8/documents/BS-8_Model/; from there download
file BS8HtmlDocumentation_15Jun02.zip, unzip it and save extracted files
on your system, open with your browser any *.html file you just saved,
and then navigate as needed.  I will send more information and files to
those who notify me that they plan to attend the meeting prior to the
meeting.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200211200949.AA4940984pd80000219816@gard.com>

In specifying a domestic hot water system in PowerDOE, I have been unable to find an input location for the primary flow of the loop (scheduled or otherwise).  I found an input for a constant process flow, which allows the model to run without getting the "zero loop flow" error, but I would like to schedule the DHW use to approximate a typical profile.  Does anyone have any insight on where to look?

Dear YU Fu Wing,

"Integer overflow" is a Fortran runtime error that may have many different
causes (although it is a quite uncommon error if you are using the standard
TRNSYS Types). You should contact your distributor and send them your
project files.

Dear all,

I followed the example "building" on the IISibat 3 to carry out a cooling load calculation of an office building. For simplification, I included only the components: a TRNSYS tmy data reader, a radiation processor, a sky temperature processor, psychometrics, TYPE 56, and a plotter. I have linked up all the components and all the components are incorporated into the necessary external files. When I run the simulation, the error "Integer Overflow" obtained within the TRNSYS environment and the simulation was stopped. I would like to know what problems exist and how to trace the problems.

Best regards

Hi Fu Wing,

TRNSYS has a standard building example, which shows how
to connect things together. Just open the file
\Trnsys15\IISiBat3\Data\Samples\Building\Building.tpf
in IISiBat.

This should answer most of your questions.

This example is also described in the manual.

To connect your IISiBat project to the building made with PREBID,
use the 'External Files' tab in IISiBat (use the 'Browse' button next
to the BLD or TRN file name).

Dear all

I am working out the cooling load calculation for a typical office building using TRNSYS (version 15). I have prepared a waether data file in the TRNSYS TMY format and the building model by using PREBID. Now I face difficulty proceeding the calculation by using IISibat 3 with TYPE 56 as I found that the building model requires the following inputs:

I have no idea about how to obtain these parameters based on my weather file. At the same time, I would like to know a proper procedure to carry out my calculation (i.e. whether my calculation can be finished within IlSiBat 3 entirely).

I am organizing a seminar for an upcoming ASHRAE meeting (either June 2003
or January 2004) with the working title "Successful applications of energy
simulation in building design".  Speakers are required to discuss the
following topics:

*	Applying simulation during the preliminary and detailed design
phases to improve energy efficiency and to reduce capital and operating
costs.  This should not be for ultra high performing green buildings, but
rather for more conventional construction.
*	Experiences in using simulation for qualifying for utility or
government incentive programmes.

Does anyone have a resource for DOE-2 bin weather files (specifically for Boston) based on more recent data?  The file for Boston on the doe2 site seems a bit cool - especially with respect to the past few years.  To illustrate, analysis of the DOE-2 bostonma.bin file shows that the degree-hours over 75 F, divided by the degree-hours over 55 F, equals just 7%.  However, the same calculation using temperature-bin data for Boston (hours between 95-100 F, hours between 90-95 F, etc.) returns a value of approximately 25%.

Thanks.

Apologies for confusion - the IRR quoted is simply for the decision to utilise a VFD instead of not using a VFD. The economics of raised floor air conditioning is an entirely different subject.

Subject: [bldg-sim] VAV control of underfloor air



Although I have always been interested in designing such a system I have yet to do so.  However, that doesn't seem to stop me from adding in some anecdotal information from friends who have designed such systems.  First off (not from friends, this is my own observation), a VFD for an air handler tends to be nearly the same cost as a starter, except for the additional control point-that being the differential pressure sensor.  Additionally, to keep costs down, I would let the VFD control the situation, not the EMCS.  Just have the VFD update the EMCS, and allow the EMCS to reset the differential pressure sensor.  Go ahead and monitor all the points you want, and at least do start / stop, status, and DP sensor reset.  Like Robert says, the VFD is a cost wise investment, even if you end up later on setting it up to be a constant speed system, the cost risk is low.

Now I would like some additional information.  The IRR of 30% to 50%; is that just for the mechanical investment or everything?  Since this type of system uses a raised floor system, all the utilities end up running under the floor.  Code will dictate the use of plenum rated cable (even when run inside conduit), the floor system itself tends to be proprietary-or at best limited in number of suppliers--hence supply and demand comes into play driving the cost of the floor up and that is beyond the fact that it is already more expensive since it needs to be structurally capable of carrying the loads (including areas for very large filing systems), there are a limited number of suppliers of underfloor vav systems (and the quality varies), as a positive there is a greatly reduced amount of sheet metal used for ductwork, there usually is not a realistic coordination between cubical / office layout and diffuser placement (in large jobs, the eventual leasee is unknown hence their layout needs are unknown) causing problems by a maintenance staff that is unfamiliar with the system (despite training), and another maintenance problem are users who do not understand nor properly utilize the system hence they will block the diffusers (more often then the overhead type).  Plumbing may also be run in the floor space as well as other utilities causing a need for additional wall furrings then may be in a more traditional layout. Was there any account of these items in the IRR, or was it a theoretical value based only on the mechanical components?

I do not mean to discourage anyone from using this system, I actually am very interested and excited to implement this type of system, and believe (instinctually) that it is an energy efficient alternative to the traditional diffusion method of airside systems.  The points listed above are things you should be aware of, and are questions to ask so as to minimize their impact.

As Rob says Good Luck, and have some fun!

A typical design is to zone the floor compartment according to aspect and allow the individuals to adjust the swirls. 
There are only a handful of large VAVs and the fan speed is varied according to duct static pressure (not plenum pressure).

In most instances, I have found that the internal rate of return is between 30% & 50% and hence is a good investment. I am sure VSD pricing and energy pricing varies but a point to note is that the RH control is improved.

Do any of you out there have any experience designing an underfloor air

curious if it ends up operating like a constant volume system or is it worth

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200211041032.AA3237765pd80000212537@gard.com>

Regarding the VFD control, what I suggested is not new.  You let the VFD be
the application specific controller (ASC, by some manufacturers
terminology).  ABB, Graham, and others do this regularly.  The EMCS is
hooked up to the VFD "controller," The VFD works to maintain its programmed
set point, which is decided by the EMCS.  The VFD will continuously
communicate with the DP sensor, while routinely communicate with the EMCS
main system.  This arrangement is beneficial to the overall EMCS system in
that it minimizes traffic on the cable, and frees up the main system from
having to send speed control signals to the VFD on a continuous basis as
well as continuously monitor the DP sensor.  It is very similar to an ASC on
a VAV box.  The main system does not monitor, continuously the temperature
in each zone and then command the damper and valve to adjust accordingly;
the ASC monitors the zone temperature continuously, adjusts accordingly, and
then reports to the main EMCS system to inform it as to the current
situation as well as receive new instructions.
 
I did not mean to imply that the VFD was a controller unto itself, rather an
integral part of an EMCS system, however I am making the VFD work more for
its money.  If you look more into this, and ask VFD manufactures, you will
find this is becoming more the standard practice.  Interestingly though,
mechanical designers do not show this arrangement, or are not aware that
what they show is not what they are receiving.  What they are actually
getting is a VFD that functions the way they asked, but is cheaper to
install and works better.

I do not agree with this concept.  Using stand alone VFD control loses the
integrated features of a building DDC system. 
-How does one adjust and tune the VFD static pressure control? 
-How does one deal with PID windup problems? 
-When the system is commissioned, establishing the correct static pressure
control setpoint will be VERY difficult without DDC access to VAV box damper
positions. 
The cost to control a VFD from the building DDC system will actually be less
when the VFD is connected to the DDC system using modBUD or LON network...
you only run one data cable from DDC controller to the VFD, and you pick up
all 60 or so VFD data points, some of which are quite useful for diagnostics
and monitoring energy use.

A typical design is to zone the floor compartment according to aspect and allow the individuals to adjust the swirls.
There are only a handful of large VAVs and the fan speed is varied according to duct static pressure (not plenum pressure).

In most instances, I have found that the internal rate of return is between 30% & 50% and hence is a good investment. I am sure VSD pricing and energy pricing varies but a point to note is that the RH control is improved.

Good luck!

Do any of you out there have any experience designing an underfloor air
system with VAV control.  The particular system I am looking at is a plenum
based system with manually adjustable swirl diffusers (Titus/Krantz).  I am
curious if it ends up operating like a constant volume system or is it worth
the expense of installing the freq drive and the Static pressure sensor or
differential pressure sensor.  Any help is greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Louis
