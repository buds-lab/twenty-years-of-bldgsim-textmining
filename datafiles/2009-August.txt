FYI. 

Try going into the BDL and set DAYLIGHT-SAVINGS = YES. I believe this was carried-over from DOE2.1e.  There should be something in the manual on this as well.

Is there a way I can get the schedule used by eQuest to estimate the
daylight savings?
I assume it may be in one of the software files.

Hi
 
A quick browse through appendix G doesn't mention local buildings in the
shading. Is it true local buildings aren't considered in the shading calc
for A90?

My reading of 90.1-2004 does not explicitly disallow external shading
devices.  Neither does it clearly define how they might be accounted for
in baseline/proposed models.   

 

The closest thing would be Table G3.1, Section 5.  This is clear about
permanent "self-shading" such as overhangs/fins being allowed for the
proposed and not for the baseline.  External permanent shading devices
such as local buildings aren't brought up here.

 

I believe, at the modeler's discretion, local buildings/geographic
features with significant shading effects ought to be considered.
Incorporating these in a manner that preserves the intent of the
"normalized" building orientation for the baseline however could prove
tricky.  

 

First, the location and orientation of such external shading devices
would need to be adjusted for each of the four "turns."  For example, a
large skyscraper adjacent to your building's West in the proposed should
move to the building's relative North, East, and South as the building
orientation is adjusted for the baseline.  

 

The second and more thorny point to consider is how to account for that
skyscraper's 2D coordinates relative to the building at each rotation.
I think the most logical route to take would be to maintain the relative
X/Y coordinates from the building footprint's centroid.  This however in
some cases might result in one or more of the rotations placing the
skyscraper ON the modeled building.  In such a case, you might take an
alternative approach of adding an additional 30 or so degrees to each
rotation, effectively getting a normalized set of results, but avoiding
a physical conflict of location (i.e. instead of 0,90,180,270 orient at
30,120,210,300 from actual).  Strictly speaking this would violate
G3.1,5(a) in wording (as it dictates 90, 180,270 from actual), but not
in intent - I would therefore accompany these averaged results with a
written explanation of how such intent is maintained.

 

 

A caveat: I haven't tried anything of this sort myself so I am only
speculating at how I would approach this.  I'd be very interested to
hear others' experiences with submitting models accounting for permanent
external shading devices under 90.1.

During a EAc1 training seminar put on by the USGBC I distinctly remember
them saying that you shouldn't account for shading from other structures,
there is no way to be sure that the other structure will remain for the life
of the building that you are modeling.

Hello,

Through our experience of a couple of projects, we would suggest that the
project should be credited when there is considerable saving through the
shading of local buildings/structures.
Please find an appropriate view over this issue at:
http://greenbuildinggenie.com/tips/item/13-neighborhood-building-shading

This site seems to be cataloging all such issues as either Hot Tips or Hot
Issue. I find the collection quite informative .

Regards,

Surekha Tetali.

Hi
I have recently modeled and submitted surrounding building shading effect in
both the proposed and baseline for a commercial campus.
The arguement is that in a campus situation where multiple bldgs are owned
and designed by the same party,shading can be intelligently used to offset
cooling loads and for a building which is shaded by neighbouring buildings
on all sides,simulation results would be considerably different if we
discount the shading.

Yes, I think when you can verify the permanence of the shading structure the
USGBC should be more lenient in the allowing credit for the shading
(especially since the argument is that it may not be there in the future)

Hello,

Through our experience of a couple of projects, we would suggest that the
project should be credited when there is considerable saving through the
shading of local buildings/structures.
Please find an appropriate view over this issue at:

This site seems to be cataloging all such issues as either Hot Tips or Hot

Dear David:

This is Just a question about the life in Hamburg, because I have just heard
that non-German people specially MUSLIMS suffer from Religious Racism and
Discrimination, and even reached killing, does it exist also in Hamburg like
Dresden?

I really thank you very much Christian for your email:

Well, i am actually Egyptian and having my PhD in Urban Climate God Willing.
That is why i was asking about Hamburg following the posts emailed before. 
Hope we can all live together in peace and forgiveness, and i really looking
forward to meeting such a person like you Christian some day regardless the
posts. 

Hope the moderators excuse me for emailing again but this reply from Christian
deserves to be published, as you can see that our RESEARCHES are not away from
what hapenns in our communitities.

I thought no body will reply to my email regarding my trials to ask about this
issue. It is obviously very hard to ask or even initiate a discussion about
that now a days due the incorrect understanding of Islam teachings and history,
despite simply the word Islam itself in Arabic means PEACE and to submit to our
creator.

Thanks again to Christian and to bldg-sim at lists
Salam to All,
Mohamad

Dear IBPSA Board and All Simulationists,

 

This is an early invitation to submit articles and announcements for the
upcoming issue of IBPSA News (October 2009).  Specially those of you who
were at the BS'09 Conference in Glasgow, I would like to invite you to send
an interesting short article about the event, and/or selected photos
(maximum 2, no more than 1 MB in total) from, or related to, the Conference.
Interesting photos of/about Glasgow are also welcome.

 

As usual, I would also invite IBPSA Affiliates to send announcements or
articles from each Affiliate about activities that have taken place in their
regions, including conferences and meetings. Other items related to software
news are also encouraged: new releases, updates, new versions, training
seminars, notable projects, etc. - all are welcomed.

 

Please send to me at your earliest convenience so it arrives before 21
September.

 

Thank you for your assistance and contributions.

Message-ID: <711064D0C99F894496909F859B88FD5C01010ABE@EXVS5.burnsmcd.com>

All,

 

I am trying to model a building with electric baseboard heating on an
outdoor air reset schedule.  My summary bar chart showing end use energy
shows zero for energy used for space heating, for all months.  However,
when I export hourly results for a system or zone, it shows that the
baseboard energy was appropriately modeled.  I ran a model with no
heating to verify that my first model had added cooling to make up for
the heating, and it did.  It just seems like there is a glitch in eQuest
that doesn't show the electric baseboard heating as an enduse.  This
only happens if using the outdoor reset ratio type of schedule.  If
using the thermostatic control of the baseboards, the heating end use
shows up fine.

 

Any ideas?  Thanks a million  

 

Jarrod McMains

Amandine,
 
We have had success (with a ventilated facade DSF configuration) using
an approach similar to what you're proposing.  The challenge with it and
other configurations depends on the interaction of the DSF and the
building spaces.  We coupled eQUEST, TRNSYS, COMIS, and wind tunnel test
data to achieve what seems to be a reasonable solution, especially for
the purposes of a cost analysis and LEED documentation.

Paul

Hi Paul and Amandine

I am working for some time on DSF and I had data both from buildigs and 
test cells. Now I have a student using En+ trying to match the collected 
data (test cell) and there are some problems. If you have some published 
or useable results I would appreciate.

Regards

Fernando

Sorry I haven't any data with EnergyPlus. The only thing I know is that EnergyPlus is able to understand that the radiation is passing through both glass layers of the DSF and that now you have the "small" CFD which you can couple to the usual thermal simulation in E+ but I haven't try it. 
 
I think I will follow my idea to create a model in Equest and model the DSF in E+. 
Do you think it is a good idea for LEED documentation to make a simulation with Fluent? Because I don't think we will be able to make a wind tunnel test (too expensive).

	Amandine,
	 
	We have had success (with a ventilated facade DSF configuration) using an approach similar to what you're proposing.  The challenge with it and other configurations depends on the interaction of the DSF and the building spaces.  We coupled eQUEST, TRNSYS, COMIS, and wind tunnel test data to achieve what seems to be a reasonable solution, especially for the purposes of a cost analysis and LEED documentation.

Holly:

The tentative dates for the SIMBUILD 2010 conference in New York city are August 9 -13th, 2010. 

Hopefully, this will be held on the NYU campus in NYC. There are still a few details to work out with the contract before it is signed.
Once this is signed, and a deposit put down, the announcement for the call for papers, web page update, etc., can be sent out. 
This should be resolved shortly.

Mr. Michael Bobker at CUNY is the Conference Chair with assistance from Ms. Gail Ettinger, the Conference Coordinator. They
will need lots of help once we get the contract to gel.

Message-ID: <DD19914D43E24645BD20A03688463AEF067A8F02@ex-be01.burohappold.com>

I am modelling the cost benefits of creating chilled water/ice at night
so I have added a thermal storage tank and set up a secondary chiller
and loop to serve the storage tank. I have assigned an on/off schedule
to the TES chiller so that it operates only at night, but I have also
added equipment controls so that it has first priority for cooling. This
was my initial thought on getting it to operate at night but not during
the day. I am getting an error "Ice Water Loop has zero design flow". At
first I figured this was because I had no size for the storage tank
selected so I started off small and through a 50 ton tank in the
capacity field. Still receiving the same error. Does this have to be
sized manually?

 

Here are the controls:

 

"Chiller Controls" = EQUIP-CTRL      

   TYPE             = COOLING

   CIRCULATION-LOOP = "Chilled Water Loop"

   CHILLERS-1       = ( "Ice Chiller" )

   CHILLERS-2       = ( "Air Cooled Chiller 1" )

   ..

 

and the tank

 

"Ice Storage" = THERMAL-STORAGE 

   TYPE             = COLD-WATER-TANK

   CAPACITY         = 600

   CHRG-LOOP        = "Ice Water Loop"

   CHRG-SCH         = "Ice Making Schedule Annual"

   DCHRG-LOOP       = "Chilled Water Loop"

   ..

 

 

 

Thanks in advance

Dear Cramer,
 
20 - 25 years ago I was re-writing the ASEAM code, and did some digging for
DOE boiler part load curves.  More recently, I've used them in Energy Plus
and have shown below the values I use.  No original documentation here, but
this might help...
 

 
Also,  I've recently done some analysis of existing building boiler
performance and it seems that the following is true:

*	Older "high mass" / high water volume boilers (think firetube
boilers and the like) tend to have a pretty darn flat efficiency curve
*	Newer "low mass" / low water volume boilers show dramatically lower
efficiency at part loads, similar to the DOE curve above.

If I were modeling an older system or a new system with high water volume
and good turndown, I'd probably use a constant efficiency "curve".  Other

Subject: [Bldg-sim] boiler curves - HIR-FPLR


Hi All,

I'm looking for some typical/default PLR efficiency curves for a boiler for
a LEED model. I'm using trnsys for the model, but I've been digging through
the DOE-2 documentation to try to find a typical default curve to use. I've
traced it to the "HIR-FPLR" keyword, but can't figure out where this curve
is actually described. Can anyone point me to where I can find the actual
equation?

Thanks,
Cramer

I get that error when I do novel things, too, and it goes away when I change
the loop sizing type from secondary (the default) to primary.  You may get a
warning afterwards that says that the loop is undersized for the connected
load.  I ignore these warnings since the loop is sized based on the primary
equipment capacity (which should be sufficient).

 

I hope this is helpful!

I am modelling the cost benefits of creating chilled water/ice at night so I
have added a thermal storage tank and set up a secondary chiller and loop to
serve the storage tank. I have assigned an on/off schedule to the TES
chiller so that it operates only at night, but I have also added equipment
controls so that it has first priority for cooling. This was my initial
thought on getting it to operate at night but not during the day. I am
getting an error "Ice Water Loop has zero design flow". At first I figured
this was because I had no size for the storage tank selected so I started
off small and through a 50 ton tank in the capacity field. Still receiving
the same error. Does this have to be sized manually?

 

Here are the controls:

 

"Chiller Controls" = EQUIP-CTRL      

   TYPE             = COOLING

   CIRCULATION-LOOP = "Chilled Water Loop"

   CHILLERS-1       = ( "Ice Chiller" )

   CHILLERS-2       = ( "Air Cooled Chiller 1" )

   ..

 

and the tank

 

"Ice Storage" = THERMAL-STORAGE 

   TYPE             = COLD-WATER-TANK

   CAPACITY         = 600

   CHRG-LOOP        = "Ice Water Loop"

   DCHRG-LOOP       = "Chilled Water Loop"

That did the trick. Thanks for the help. And it seems I had to introduce
different controls then I was at the time in order to get the storage
tank to provide capacity to the loop at the appropriate time. For
others, this is detailed in STORE-MAX-LOAD of DOE documentation. Example
below.

 

CHILLERS-1                  = (CHLR-A,CHLR-B)
CHILLERS-SEQ-1          = (     1,     2) 
STORE-SEQ-1               = (3)

I have a question directly related to this, especially given James'
comment regarding high vs low mass boilers.  Has anyone changed the
START-UP-TIME or STANDBY-TIME for boilers from the DOE-2 default values?
If so can you also share the basis you used to arrive at the numbers?  I
know that these are not simple numbers to arrive at; I'm just interested
in what others might have done or related comments.

Dear Cramer,

 

20 - 25 years ago I was re-writing the ASEAM code, and did some digging
for DOE boiler part load curves.  More recently, I've used them in
Energy Plus and have shown below the values I use.  No original
documentation here, but this might help...

 

 

 

Also,  I've recently done some analysis of existing building boiler
performance and it seems that the following is true:

*	Older "high mass" / high water volume boilers (think firetube
boilers and the like) tend to have a pretty darn flat efficiency curve
*	Newer "low mass" / low water volume boilers show dramatically
lower efficiency at part loads, similar to the DOE curve above.

If I were modeling an older system or a new system with high water
volume and good turndown, I'd probably use a constant efficiency
"curve".  Other boilers would get a curve that resulted in low part load
efficiencies.

FYI:

This all depends on the manufacturer and specifics of the unit, and/or resizing, etc.

I just had my Lennox evaporator replaced on a 5 ton unit...to prepare for a SEER upgrade and it fit into the same old cabinet, same number of rows of coils, but the new unit has a TXV valve, vs a cap tube. However, the higher SEER exterior condensor  is MUCH bigger than the lower SEER unit, and can be a two speed or variable speed unit. Sometimes, I've been told, there can be fewer rows of coils in a higher SEER unit, which raises efficiency, but lowers moisture removal (not good in the south).

Message-ID: <c53178e80908112157x5ecddcadqa8a405c18463ab4e@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,



I am working with Design Builder and trying to run simulations for a
building using natural ventilation. While building the model, I introduced
custom openings on the external fa?ade.



I ran two simulations using only natural ventilation. One with all windows
closed and the other with 80% open. I input this setting in the ?Operation?
slider bar within the ?Openings? tab. I was expecting the operative
temperature to increase when the windows were closed. But both simulations
had the same results.



I am not sure if there is way to model to openings. The ?Operation? option
was available only under the Internal windows menu and not for the external
window.



Would be helpful if anybody could suggest possible solution for this.



Thanks in advance,

Deepa

I have gone through the steps outlined in previous discussions to

I have tried multiple scenarios including having the DCV sensors at the

this scenario possible and which parameters do I need to modify?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] modeling openings in Design Builder

 

Hello All,

 

I am working with Design Builder and trying to run simulations for a
building using natural ventilation. While building the model, I introduced
custom openings on the external fa?ade. 

 

I ran two simulations using only natural ventilation. One with all windows
closed and the other with 80% open. I input this setting in the ?Operation?
slider bar within the ?Openings? tab. I was expecting the operative
temperature to increase when the windows were closed. But both simulations
had the same results. 

 

I am not sure if there is way to model to openings. The ?Operation? option
was available only under the Internal windows menu and not for the external
window. 

 

Would be helpful if anybody could suggest possible solution for this.

 

Thanks in advance,

Deepa

Dear all,

Does anyone have an idea to place a dimming light(s) in an IES-VE model?
The artificial light has to supplement the available day lighting to
achieve (500 Lux ) in the space.  The dimming light has to be linked to
the Apache Sim, so that the light electricity consumption will show up
in the simulation results. Your step-by-step guidance is highly

Hi all,
?
I am a new member of the group. I work on visualdoe and Equest softwares.?I have a basic question with reference to the peak cooling load. 
The Peak cooling load is very less when compared to the cooling capacity of the system (by more than 50%) in some of the projects. What is the reason for this? I am checking the Peak cooling load in SS-A report.

Rathna:

The SS-A Peak Cooling is, of course, for the individual systems within a building. They are usually quite low as one does not usually specify the design cooling people, lights, equipment, etc in an energy model, which is what eQuest and Visual DOE represent.

You are also not having the peak internal loads coincide with each other and with the peak external cooling load.

I believe others on this forum can share similar experiences.

In Radiance (in the appropriate rooms):

1. Set appropriate properties for the glazing, walls, ceilings and
floors. Take care with the Radiance glazing parameter 'transmissivity',
which is not the same as transmittance. Radiance provides a utility for
converting between the two. The transmittance should be set to match the
normal incidence light transmittance from the glazing manufacturer.
Apply a factor for the frame (Radiance doesn't do this automatically).

2. Create daylight sensors.

3. Run the 'Apache' daylight simulation to create the illuminance (.ill)
file.

 

In Apache View:

1. Set up an appropriate formula profile to control electrical lighting
as a function of working plane daylight illuminance e1 (note that e2 is
not currently available). Create weekly or annual profiles using this
daily profile, as appropriate. An example profile is given in the ApPro
User Guide (and other manuals):

ramp(e1,0,1,500,.4) a formula suitable for applying as a dimming profile
controlling lighting gain as a function of available daylight. It
modulates the lighting gain as a function of the illuminance on the
working plane, e1. The value of the profile falls from 1 at zero
illuminance to 0.4 at illuminance 500 lux, thereafter remaining constant
at this value. The value 0.4 (which you should set as appropriate)
represents the fraction of the room's lighting gain which is not subject
to daylight control. The illuminance e1 must be computed using the link
to Radiance.

Use different formulae as necessary to cater for conditions in different
rooms.

2. Apply this profile as a dimming profile in the room or rooms.

3. Run ApacheSim with the Radiance link turned on.

4. View lighting gains (turn on the 'sensible internal gains breakdown'
output group in the ApacheSim dialog) and e1 values in Vista.

Julia,

Well said.  We were just discussing this today and share your concerns, especially the lack of transparency considering past inconsistencies.  In addition to filing our grievances with the USGBC, we're also open to the notion of sharing CIR submittals and responses in some forum, possibly BLDG-RATE.  If we're forced to buy interpretations for any/every project, we might as well share with the modeling/LEED-hurdling community to provide efficiency for all and, ultimately,  accountability of the CIR process.

In my opinion, this departure from a historical, precedent-setting CIR database is concerning and is a move in the wrong direction - especially with respect to CIRs related to energy modeling for LEED NC EA Pr2 and EACredit 1.
 
Most of the LEED energy models I have performed have been for laboratory and health-care building types using the ASHRAE 90.1-2004, Appendix G, modeling protocol.   I have found the historical CIR database invaluable with respect to interpretations, application and substantiation for certification submittals.

They also lessened the extra financial (and time) burden these project types potentially faced by eliminating the need to submit repeated CIRs on the same topics for each model/project.
 
LEED 2009 uses ASHRAE 90.1-2007, Appendix G.  In my estimation, while the 2007 edition has made improvements in addressing the unique modeling requirements for laboratories (and to a lesser degree health-care), there are still many unaddressed specifics for these building types.  By eliminating reliance upon a historical, precedent-setting CIR database and making each project submit CIRs, LEED/GBCI will unfairly increase the financial (and time) burden of LEED certification for laboratory and health-care projects.  It will force us to unnecessarily submit and receive approval on CIRs that come up on almost every laboratory and health-care building.  Additionally, it is very likely to increase the inconsistency in which the standard is applied across these project types.  Based on my experience with LEED certification submittals, there is a lack of consistency amongst USBGC CIR responders as well as LEED reviewers.  This is understandable given the complexity of the standard and its application across such a broad range of building types.  However, this reality is unfortunate at best and unfair and unreasonable at worst.   
 
If you have concern about this new direction on CIRs, I encourage you to "write your congressman" by emailing LEED and encouraging them to reconsider this approach.

Julia,

Well said.? We were just discussing this today and share your concerns, especially the lack of transparency considering past inconsistencies.? In addition to filing our grievances with the USGBC, we're also open to the notion of sharing CIR submittals and responses in some forum, possibly BLDG-RATE.? If we're forced to buy interpretations for any/every project, we might as well share with the modeling/LEED-hurdling community to provide efficiency for all and, ultimately,??accountability of the CIR process.

Hello All,


Thought I'd bring the new?policy regarding CIRs for?LEED 2009/v3 projects to the Bldg-sim community's?attention for discussion and potential action.??It's a big change.? (The following is copied from the new GBCI Policy Manual).

All CIR rulings that are generated in response to a CIR submitted on or before June 26, 2009, and pertain to a pre-LEED 2009 Rating System, are precedent setting.? Such rulings will be referenced in the CIR database.? Accordingly, the CIR ruling will carry forth and apply to other pre-LEED 2009 projects submitted by the same Project Team and also be available as a ruling for other pre-LEED 2009 projects registered by other project teams. ?
>
>All CIR rulings that are generated in response to a CIR submitted after June 26, 2009, for all rating systems including pre-LEED 2009 and current versions, will be project specific.? As a result, the ruling will only apply to the project for which the CIR was submitted, and there will be no corresponding entry in the CIR database.? Accordingly, the CIR ruling will not be precedent setting and will not carry forth and apply to other projects submitted by the same Project Team nor be available as a ruling for other projects registered by other project teams. ?
>
>Please Note: THE CIR DATABASE THAT WAS CREATED FOR PRE-LEED 2009 RATING SYSTEMS MAY NOT BE REFERENCED OR RELIED UPON BY PROJECT TEAMS PURSUING CERTIFICATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH LEED 2009 RATING SYSTEMS. 
>
>
>In my opinion, this departure from a historical, precedent-setting CIR database is concerning and is a move in the wrong direction -?especially with respect to?CIRs related to energy modeling for LEED NC EA Pr2 and EACredit 1.
>
>Most of the LEED energy models I have performed have been for laboratory and health-care building types using the ASHRAE 90.1-2004, Appendix G, modeling protocol.???I have found the historical CIR database invaluable with respect to?interpretations, application and?substantiation for?certification submittals.? As many of you may be aware, there were many holes in the 2004 edition regarding the application of the standard to these project types (not to mention others).? Judging by Bldg-sim traffic and my own experience, this?caused much confusion and consternation amongst energy modelers.?

Message-ID: <B48F2F9E06614945A93A1D0C1929146C01606FFA@DHOST001-36.DEX001.intermedia.net>

All,
I am modeling a packaged single zone system with furnace and DX cooling.
The default for the auxiliary load on the furnace is 800 Btu/hr, which I
assume is a pilot light load.

Under table 6.8.1E, the standard says, "Units must also include an
interrupted or intermittent ignition device (IID)." How do go about
modeling the IID or is the energy use insignificant compared to the
furnace energy use?

Hi,

 

Just a detail to add, 

 

If you have any layer turn off, turn it on for the radiance calculation
and once completed turn it back on for the Apache calc, otherwise you ll
see an error message. 

 

Regards

Michael

In Radiance (in the appropriate rooms):

1. Set appropriate properties for the glazing, walls, ceilings and
floors. Take care with the Radiance glazing parameter 'transmissivity',
which is not the same as transmittance. Radiance provides a utility for
converting between the two. The transmittance should be set to match the
normal incidence light transmittance from the glazing manufacturer.
Apply a factor for the frame (Radiance doesn't do this automatically).

2. Create daylight sensors.

3. Run the 'Apache' daylight simulation to create the illuminance (.ill)
file.

 

In Apache View:

1. Set up an appropriate formula profile to control electrical lighting
as a function of working plane daylight illuminance e1 (note that e2 is
not currently available). Create weekly or annual profiles using this
daily profile, as appropriate. An example profile is given in the ApPro
User Guide (and other manuals):

ramp(e1,0,1,500,.4) a formula suitable for applying as a dimming profile
controlling lighting gain as a function of available daylight. It
modulates the lighting gain as a function of the illuminance on the
working plane, e1. The value of the profile falls from 1 at zero
illuminance to 0.4 at illuminance 500 lux, thereafter remaining constant
at this value. The value 0.4 (which you should set as appropriate)
represents the fraction of the room's lighting gain which is not subject
to daylight control. The illuminance e1 must be computed using the link
to Radiance.

Use different formulae as necessary to cater for conditions in different
rooms.

2. Apply this profile as a dimming profile in the room or rooms.

3. Run ApacheSim with the Radiance link turned on.

4. View lighting gains (turn on the 'sensible internal gains breakdown'
output group in the ApacheSim dialog) and e1 values in Vista.

Dear all,

Does anyone have an idea to place a dimming light(s) in an IES-VE model?
The artificial light has to supplement the available day lighting to
achieve (500 Lux ) in the space.  The dimming light has to be linked to
the Apache Sim, so that the light electricity consumption will show up
in the simulation results. Your step-by-step guidance is highly
appreciated. Many thanks

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Cogeneration/Generator Modeling
Message-ID: <001801ca20d6$9e875580$db960080$@com>

Hello to everyone once again,

 

I posed a question similar to this and Otto S. was kind enough to steer me
in the right direction but I am looking for a bit more assistance if anyone
if familiar with cogeneration or just generator modeling in general. I need
to add a 75 kW co gen unit as an improvement, I was told that this is to be
modeled in a copy of my file and then compared to from the original. So I
went ahead and created a gas fired generator and added a sale meter and all
the appropriate rates, connected the heat output to the DHW loop, and the
model acts as if there is nothing there. My original and my cogen building
look almost identical in sim outputs. 

 

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Below I?m pasting my BDL output that
relates to this

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Air leakage, LEED, and Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1
Message-ID: <E125A6B4869B6149A7C5193BEF6B26C003C2E18D@198-067-009-006.prosoco.com>

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) did an
extensive study documenting a greater than 40% natural gas savings and a
greater than 25% electricity savings across the nation for building
energy consumption if buildings were uniformly constructed with air
barrier systems installed.  They evaluated 116 existing buildings and
computer modeled several different building types.  The purpose of their
study was to provide information to ASHRAE concerning whether it would
be desirable to add an air barrier requirement to ASHRAE 90.1.

 

As a result, I've always thought that Appendix G to ASHRAE 90.1 allows
you to change the air leakage rate off the default and onto a rate
corresponding to an air barrier installation, so that you could claim
LEED points for the corresponding energy savings.  However, an architect
at a presentation I did said you could not do that under the LEED and
ASHRAE requirements.  (I know the models will do it, because I've done
it on the TRANE model and obtained results that support the NIST
findings.)

 

I see in Appendix G that:  "G3.1.2.5. Ventilation.  Minimum outdoor air
ventilation rates shall be the same for the proposed and baseline
building designs."  However, I searched the document for "outdoor air
ventilation" and the phrase occurs only in the context of mechanical
systems that are designed to intentionally bring air into the building.
If this section is the basis for concluding that air leakage barriers
should be left out of the modeling, then I have trouble understanding
why.

 

Appendix G says that all components of the building are to be modeled as
designed.  That would preclude modeling as if an air barrier system did
not exist in the design.  It says the baseline building model is to have
steel-framed above-grade walls, and it is silent about the design
building, but the User's Manual says that if the design building walls
are block or cast concrete, then "the mass is credited in the building
performance rating method."  Likewise, if the walls are wood stud
instead of steel, then the Manual says credit is given for the superior
energy performance of wood frame versus steel frame.  The User's Manual
states that it:  "Offers information on the intent and application of
Standard 90.1."  Given these examples in the Manual based on existing
thermal mass energy-saving data and wood-versus-steel stud energy data,
it is difficult to conclude that a wall that is constructed with
materials meeting the air leakage limits and installation requirements
of the Air Barrier Association of America and determined to produce
significant energy savings by the NIST study based on those same limits
and requirements should be modeled as if it leaked air like a building
without an air barrier. 

 

Please let me know what you think, and if you know of any reason why it
is not proper to change the air leakage rate through the building
envelope in the design model to show the benefit of air barriers.

 

Thanks,

Mr. John,
?
Thank?you?for the reply. I have mentioned the design cooling people, lights, equipment, etc precisely for the projects. And also, if the peak load shown is not correct then we cannot use visual doe for sizing the equipment in the preliminary stage of the design. Is my understanding correct? Which report do we have to refer, to get the peak cooling load of the building?
?
Thank you in advance.

Rathna:

The SS-A Peak Cooling is, of course, for the individual systems within a building. They are usually quite low as one does not usually specify the design cooling people, lights, equipment, etc in an energy model, which is what eQuest and Visual DOE represent.

You are also not having the peak internal loads coincide with each other and with the peak external cooling load.

I believe others on this forum can share similar experiences.

Respected Sir/ Madam,

I am Arthi student of Refrigeration and Airconditioning Engineering
division. I am doing my project in the area of chillers. And my project
title is "Integrated Part Load Charecteristics of Chillers for Indian
climate conditions". How can i know that the chiller is running at
particular part load condition and also i am going to find out the iplv for
4 part load conditions say 100,75,50,25.. if the real part load is in
between these value means how can i round up that.

Hi

 

To view building HVAC peak load summary , refer to SS-D report. If you
want to get the peak cooling load refer this report. 

 

 

SS- A report give us  system load summary , ( I don't how you input data
for the system in wizard/ DD).

I see that weather is causing many issues for people in non US regions. I
have replied to a couple of you with more targeted information but here are
some resources to help you overcome these problems.

 

http://www.wunderground.com/ ? This website contains historical data for
thousands of locations worldwide, they allow you to specify windows of time
that you wish to have data for. The data is exportable to CSV and other
similar data types.

 

http://www.ecotect.com/node/702 and http://www.doe2.com/Download/Weather/ 

 

The ecotect link has some information and direction to a tool that will aide
you in creating importable files for eQuest or other modeling software that
you might have. The DOE link is directly from DOE2 website, there are some
weather utilities there, as well as plenty of weather files for US sites
that you can use to help you format your data if you need to do custom
inputs.

 

I hope this proves to be of some help to all of you modeling outside of the
country. If anyone would like more direction or help with this feel free to
drop me a line and I will attempt to help you as I can.

 

Thank you,

The savings on pilot lights is definitely noteworthy.  If your design
furnace does not have a pilot light that should be zero'd out.

Message-ID: <c53178e80908210729i5244f637vb82adff2c15eaeb4@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

I just started using Design Builder and was understanding it better when the
one month evaluation period ran out. And now my project is hanging midway.

I tried to download and install the one month version the second time, but
it would not let me install again on my laptop. Does anybody know about any
alternative to this situation? How can download again? I want to able use to
use it for atleast 3 months, before I decide to buy the software.

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Dear Cramer,
 
A recent LEED Silver project used this explanation:
 
"Process load is comprised of receptacles and elevators only, and accounts
for slightly less than 17% of the total energy cost.  The receptacle load is
assumed to be 0.75 W/sf throughout, which is consistent with ASHRAE 90.1 and
reflects the tenants' concern for efficient office equipment. The receptacle
loads also use diversity factors that roughly parallel occupancy.  The
elevator energy is derived using actual KW and a diversity schedule that
reflects normal usage patterns. 
The Diversity schedules are shown on the accompanying updated "HVAC Data
Summary". These values are based on  actual, designed peak energy use and
appropriate diversity.  Therefore, even though somewhat lower than 25% of
the total energy cost, we are confident that they reflect the actual
situation adequately and should be considered acceptable."

Hi All,

I'm working up a detailed breakdown for process loads in a LEED model, to
justify using less than 25% of total. I'm wondering what other people have
gotten down to. If you've submitted with lower than 25%, how low did you
get, and how detailed was your analysis supporting it? I've got computers
and other electronic equipment, task lighting, and I'm working on the
elevator. Anything I'm missing? The building is ~50,000 sf, mostly office,
but also a workout area (I'm accounting for treadmills but nothing else
draws any power).

Thanks,
Cramer

You are fortunate that the explanation worked.  I used a very 
similarly worded explanation for a project I submitted and the 
reviewer didn't go for it.  "Inconsistency" seems to be the keyword

My engineering sensibilities say, "If the facts bear out a lower-than-25% situation, then that's what should be accepted."  I'd be interested to hear what objections have been raised by reviewers who disputed your explanation......

As I understand it the issue is that the 90.1 Standard does not establish a
base line condition for air leakage so no savings can be claimed.  I
certainly agree that the savings are real and should be counted.  I know
that the Appendix G committee has this issue on their extensive ?to do?
list.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Air leakage, LEED, and Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1

 

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) did an extensive
study documenting a greater than 40% natural gas savings and a greater than
25% electricity savings across the nation for building energy consumption if
buildings were uniformly constructed with air barrier systems installed.
They evaluated 116 existing buildings and computer modeled several different
building types.  The purpose of their study was to provide information to
ASHRAE concerning whether it would be desirable to add an air barrier
requirement to ASHRAE 90.1.

 

As a result, I?ve always thought that Appendix G to ASHRAE 90.1 allows you
to change the air leakage rate off the default and onto a rate corresponding
to an air barrier installation, so that you could claim LEED points for the
corresponding energy savings.  However, an architect at a presentation I did
said you could not do that under the LEED and ASHRAE requirements.  (I know
the models will do it, because I?ve done it on the TRANE model and obtained
results that support the NIST findings.)

 

I see in Appendix G that:  ?G3.1.2.5. Ventilation.  Minimum outdoor air
ventilation rates shall be the same for the proposed and baseline building
designs.?  However, I searched the document for ?outdoor air ventilation?
and the phrase occurs only in the context of mechanical systems that are
designed to intentionally bring air into the building.  If this section is
the basis for concluding that air leakage barriers should be left out of the
modeling, then I have trouble understanding why.

 

Appendix G says that all components of the building are to be modeled as
designed.  That would preclude modeling as if an air barrier system did not
exist in the design.  It says the baseline building model is to have
steel-framed above-grade walls, and it is silent about the design building,
but the User?s Manual says that if the design building walls are block or
cast concrete, then ?the mass is credited in the building performance rating
method.?  Likewise, if the walls are wood stud instead of steel, then the
Manual says credit is given for the superior energy performance of wood
frame versus steel frame.  The User?s Manual states that it:  ?Offers
information on the intent and application of Standard 90.1.?  Given these
examples in the Manual based on existing thermal mass energy-saving data and
wood-versus-steel stud energy data, it is difficult to conclude that a wall
that is constructed with materials meeting the air leakage limits and
installation requirements of the Air Barrier Association of America and
determined to produce significant energy savings by the NIST study based on
those same limits and requirements should be modeled as if it leaked air
like a building without an air barrier. 

 

Please let me know what you think, and if you know of any reason why it is
not proper to change the air leakage rate through the building envelope in
the design model to show the benefit of air barriers.

 

Thanks,

I am sure there is just as much baseline for air leakage reduction
benefit as there is for the concrete walls and wooden studs that the
User's Manual says can be modeled and their energy savings captured for
inclusion in the overall modeling results.

 

I cannot accept that the USGBC and ASHRAE can arbitrarily say reduction
in air leakage will not be considered, but that increases in thermal
mass energy-savings from using concrete walls or energy benefits from
using wooden studs will be used to compute building energy performance.
This obviously rewards concrete block producers and wood stud suppliers
and penalizes air barrier suppliers.  

 

I'm reminded of Lord Acton's famous observation:  "Power corrupts, and
absolute power corrupts absolutely."  Fortunately, even the power of
organizations like ASHRAE and USGBC are subject to some ultimate check.
Such organizations are prohibited by law from arbitrary practices that
favor one group over another.  Below are excerpts from the leading
United States Supreme Court case on the subject. 

 

Paul Grahovac, LEED AP

 

American Society of Mechanical Engineers. Inc. v. Hydrolevel
Corporation, 

456 U.S. 556, 102 S.Ct. 1935, 72 L.Ed.2d. 330

(1982), Supreme Court Justice Blackmun, writing for the majority:

 

"Furthermore, a standard setting organization like ASME can be rife with

opportunities for anti competitive activity. Many of ASME's officials
are

associated with members of the industries regulated by ASME's codes.

Although, undoubtedly, most serve ASME without concern for the interests
of

their corporate employers, some may well view their positions with ASME,
at

least in part, as an opportunity to benefit their employers. When the
great

influence of ASME's reputation is placed at their disposal, the less
altruistic of

ASME's agents have an opportunity to harm their employers' competitors

through manipulation of ASME's codes."

ID.., at 571, 102 S.Ct., at 1946.

 

In American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the U.S. Supreme Court
affirmed a jury

verdict that awarded treble damages to the company that was injured by
certain members of the

trade organization that had manipulated the trade organization and its
role in the industry to set

standards designed to enrich those members' corporation and diminish the
ability of its

competitors to fairly compete in the marketplace. In deciding to hold
the trade organization

responsible for the actions of its members, the Court explained:

 

"It is true that imposing liability on ASME's agents themselves will
have some

deterrent effect, because they will know that if they violate antitrust
laws through

their participation in ASME, they risk the consequences of personal
civil liability.

But if, in addition, ASME is civilly liable for the antitrust violations
of its agents

acting with apparent authority, it is much more likely that similar
antitrust

violation will not occur in the future. "Pressure will be brought on the

organization to see to it that its agents abide by the law." United
States v. A&P

Trucking Co., 358 U.S. 121, 126, 79 S.Ct. 203, 207, 3 L.Ed.2d 165
(1958). Only

ASME can take systematic steps to make improper conduct on the part of
all its

agents unlikely, and the possibility of civil liability will inevitably
be a powerful

incentive for ASME to take those steps. Thus, a rule that imposes
liability on the

standard setting organization- which is best situated to prevent
antitrust violations

through the abuse of its reputation-is most faithful to the
congressional intent that

the private right of action deters antitrust violations."

14:., at 572-573, 102 S.Ct., at 1946.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Air leakage, LEED, and Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1

 

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) did an
extensive study documenting a greater than 40% natural gas savings and a
greater than 25% electricity savings across the nation for building
energy consumption if buildings were uniformly constructed with air
barrier systems installed.  They evaluated 116 existing buildings and
computer modeled several different building types.  The purpose of their
study was to provide information to ASHRAE concerning whether it would
be desirable to add an air barrier requirement to ASHRAE 90.1.

 

As a result, I've always thought that Appendix G to ASHRAE 90.1 allows
you to change the air leakage rate off the default and onto a rate
corresponding to an air barrier installation, so that you could claim
LEED points for the corresponding energy savings.  However, an architect
at a presentation I did said you could not do that under the LEED and
ASHRAE requirements.  (I know the models will do it, because I've done
it on the TRANE model and obtained results that support the NIST
findings.)

 

I see in Appendix G that:  "G3.1.2.5. Ventilation.  Minimum outdoor air
ventilation rates shall be the same for the proposed and baseline
building designs."  However, I searched the document for "outdoor air
ventilation" and the phrase occurs only in the context of mechanical
systems that are designed to intentionally bring air into the building.
If this section is the basis for concluding that air leakage barriers
should be left out of the modeling, then I have trouble understanding
why.

 

Appendix G says that all components of the building are to be modeled as
designed.  That would preclude modeling as if an air barrier system did
not exist in the design.  It says the baseline building model is to have
steel-framed above-grade walls, and it is silent about the design
building, but the User's Manual says that if the design building walls
are block or cast concrete, then "the mass is credited in the building
performance rating method."  Likewise, if the walls are wood stud
instead of steel, then the Manual says credit is given for the superior
energy performance of wood frame versus steel frame.  The User's Manual
states that it:  "Offers information on the intent and application of
Standard 90.1."  Given these examples in the Manual based on existing
thermal mass energy-saving data and wood-versus-steel stud energy data,
it is difficult to conclude that a wall that is constructed with
materials meeting the air leakage limits and installation requirements
of the Air Barrier Association of America and determined to produce
significant energy savings by the NIST study based on those same limits
and requirements should be modeled as if it leaked air like a building
without an air barrier. 

 

Please let me know what you think, and if you know of any reason why it
is not proper to change the air leakage rate through the building
envelope in the design model to show the benefit of air barriers.

I am sure there is just as much baseline for air leakage reduction benefit
as there is for the concrete walls and wooden studs that the User's Manual
says can be modeled and their energy savings captured for inclusion in the
overall modeling results.

 

I cannot accept that the USGBC and ASHRAE can arbitrarily say reduction in
air leakage will not be considered, but that increases in thermal mass
energy-savings from using concrete walls or energy benefits from using
wooden studs will be used to compute building energy performance.  This
obviously rewards concrete block producers and wood stud suppliers and
penalizes air barrier suppliers.  

 

I'm reminded of Lord Acton's famous observation:  "Power corrupts, and
absolute power corrupts absolutely."  Fortunately, even the power of
organizations like ASHRAE and USGBC are subject to some ultimate check.
Such organizations are prohibited by law from arbitrary practices that favor
one group over another.  Below are excerpts from the leading United States
Supreme Court case on the subject. 

 

Paul Grahovac, LEED AP

 

American Society of Mechanical Engineers. Inc. v. Hydrolevel Corporation, 

456 U.S. 556, 102 S.Ct. 1935, 72 L.Ed.2d. 330

(1982), Supreme Court Justice Blackmun, writing for the majority:

 

"Furthermore, a standard setting organization like ASME can be rife with

opportunities for anti competitive activity. Many of ASME's officials are

associated with members of the industries regulated by ASME's codes.

Although, undoubtedly, most serve ASME without concern for the interests of

their corporate employers, some may well view their positions with ASME, at

least in part, as an opportunity to benefit their employers. When the great

influence of ASME's reputation is placed at their disposal, the less
altruistic of

ASME's agents have an opportunity to harm their employers' competitors

through manipulation of ASME's codes."

ID.., at 571, 102 S.Ct., at 1946.

 

In American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed
a jury

verdict that awarded treble damages to the company that was injured by
certain members of the

trade organization that had manipulated the trade organization and its role
in the industry to set

standards designed to enrich those members' corporation and diminish the
ability of its

competitors to fairly compete in the marketplace. In deciding to hold the
trade organization

responsible for the actions of its members, the Court explained:

 

"It is true that imposing liability on ASME's agents themselves will have
some

deterrent effect, because they will know that if they violate antitrust laws
through

their participation in ASME, they risk the consequences of personal civil
liability.

But if, in addition, ASME is civilly liable for the antitrust violations of
its agents

acting with apparent authority, it is much more likely that similar
antitrust

violation will not occur in the future. "Pressure will be brought on the

organization to see to it that its agents abide by the law." United States
v. A&P

Trucking Co., 358 U.S. 121, 126, 79 S.Ct. 203, 207, 3 L.Ed.2d 165 (1958).
Only

ASME can take systematic steps to make improper conduct on the part of all
its

agents unlikely, and the possibility of civil liability will inevitably be a
powerful

incentive for ASME to take those steps. Thus, a rule that imposes liability
on the

standard setting organization- which is best situated to prevent antitrust
violations

through the abuse of its reputation-is most faithful to the congressional
intent that

the private right of action deters antitrust violations."

My understanding is that one of the co-founders of the Air Barrier
Association of America is actively involved with the committee, and I
have an e-mail from him confirming that reduction in air leakage can be
modeled and the energy savings used in the award of LEED points.

 

However, given the contrary position I am hearing, I am beginning to
become concerned that some approach other than begging ASHRAE and USGBC
to be reasonable needs to be considered.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Air leakage, LEED, and Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1

 

I am sure there is just as much baseline for air leakage reduction benefit
as there is for the concrete walls and wooden studs that the User's Manual
says can be modeled and their energy savings captured for inclusion in the
overall modeling results.

 

I cannot accept that the USGBC and ASHRAE can arbitrarily say reduction in
air leakage will not be considered, but that increases in thermal mass
energy-savings from using concrete walls or energy benefits from using
wooden studs will be used to compute building energy performance.  This
obviously rewards concrete block producers and wood stud suppliers and
penalizes air barrier suppliers.  

 

I'm reminded of Lord Acton's famous observation:  "Power corrupts, and
absolute power corrupts absolutely."  Fortunately, even the power of
organizations like ASHRAE and USGBC are subject to some ultimate check.
Such organizations are prohibited by law from arbitrary practices that favor
one group over another.  Below are excerpts from the leading United States
Supreme Court case on the subject. 

 

Paul Grahovac, LEED AP

 

American Society of Mechanical Engineers. Inc. v. Hydrolevel Corporation, 

456 U.S. 556, 102 S.Ct. 1935, 72 L.Ed.2d. 330

(1982), Supreme Court Justice Blackmun, writing for the majority:

 

"Furthermore, a standard setting organization like ASME can be rife with

opportunities for anti competitive activity. Many of ASME's officials are

associated with members of the industries regulated by ASME's codes.

Although, undoubtedly, most serve ASME without concern for the interests of

their corporate employers, some may well view their positions with ASME, at

least in part, as an opportunity to benefit their employers. When the great

influence of ASME's reputation is placed at their disposal, the less
altruistic of

ASME's agents have an opportunity to harm their employers' competitors

through manipulation of ASME's codes."

ID.., at 571, 102 S.Ct., at 1946.

 

In American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed
a jury

verdict that awarded treble damages to the company that was injured by
certain members of the

trade organization that had manipulated the trade organization and its role
in the industry to set

standards designed to enrich those members' corporation and diminish the
ability of its

competitors to fairly compete in the marketplace. In deciding to hold the
trade organization

responsible for the actions of its members, the Court explained:

 

"It is true that imposing liability on ASME's agents themselves will have
some

deterrent effect, because they will know that if they violate antitrust laws
through

their participation in ASME, they risk the consequences of personal civil
liability.

But if, in addition, ASME is civilly liable for the antitrust violations of
its agents

acting with apparent authority, it is much more likely that similar
antitrust

violation will not occur in the future. "Pressure will be brought on the

organization to see to it that its agents abide by the law." United States
v. A&P

Trucking Co., 358 U.S. 121, 126, 79 S.Ct. 203, 207, 3 L.Ed.2d 165 (1958).
Only

ASME can take systematic steps to make improper conduct on the part of all
its

agents unlikely, and the possibility of civil liability will inevitably be a
powerful

incentive for ASME to take those steps. Thus, a rule that imposes liability
on the

standard setting organization- which is best situated to prevent antitrust
violations

through the abuse of its reputation-is most faithful to the congressional
intent that

the private right of action deters antitrust violations."

14:., at 572-573, 102 S.Ct., at 1946.

As I understand it the issue is that the 90.1 Standard does not establish a
base line condition for air leakage so no savings can be claimed.  I
certainly agree that the savings are real and should be counted.  I know
that the Appendix G committee has this issue on their extensive "to do"

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Air leakage, LEED, and Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1

 

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) did an extensive
study documenting a greater than 40% natural gas savings and a greater than
25% electricity savings across the nation for building energy consumption if
buildings were uniformly constructed with air barrier systems installed.
They evaluated 116 existing buildings and computer modeled several different
building types.  The purpose of their study was to provide information to
ASHRAE concerning whether it would be desirable to add an air barrier
requirement to ASHRAE 90.1.

 

As a result, I've always thought that Appendix G to ASHRAE 90.1 allows you
to change the air leakage rate off the default and onto a rate corresponding
to an air barrier installation, so that you could claim LEED points for the
corresponding energy savings.  However, an architect at a presentation I did
said you could not do that under the LEED and ASHRAE requirements.  (I know
the models will do it, because I've done it on the TRANE model and obtained
results that support the NIST findings.)

 

I see in Appendix G that:  "G3.1.2.5. Ventilation.  Minimum outdoor air
ventilation rates shall be the same for the proposed and baseline building
designs."  However, I searched the document for "outdoor air ventilation"
and the phrase occurs only in the context of mechanical systems that are
designed to intentionally bring air into the building.  If this section is
the basis for concluding that air leakage barriers should be left out of the
modeling, then I have trouble understanding why.

 

Appendix G says that all components of the building are to be modeled as
designed.  That would preclude modeling as if an air barrier system did not
exist in the design.  It says the baseline building model is to have
steel-framed above-grade walls, and it is silent about the design building,
but the User's Manual says that if the design building walls are block or
cast concrete, then "the mass is credited in the building performance rating
method."  Likewise, if the walls are wood stud instead of steel, then the
Manual says credit is given for the superior energy performance of wood
frame versus steel frame.  The User's Manual states that it:  "Offers
information on the intent and application of Standard 90.1."  Given these
examples in the Manual based on existing thermal mass energy-saving data and
wood-versus-steel stud energy data, it is difficult to conclude that a wall
that is constructed with materials meeting the air leakage limits and
installation requirements of the Air Barrier Association of America and
determined to produce significant energy savings by the NIST study based on
those same limits and requirements should be modeled as if it leaked air
like a building without an air barrier. 

 

Please let me know what you think, and if you know of any reason why it is
not proper to change the air leakage rate through the building envelope in
the design model to show the benefit of air barriers.

 

Thanks,

If you are only looking at operating costs, another possibility is that your

calculated.  If you use this method rather than a straight $/kWh approach,
you will have subtle differences in operating costs for different end uses.

Andrew - another area that might be contributing to the discrepancy is
scheduling. Make sure you are using identical usage schedules for both

The first step is to review the metering end-use assignments, which I believe you can find in the air-system -> metering tabs.  Most useful in the spreadsheet view.

If that doesn't uncover it, I would use a program such as Compare-It! or WinDiff to verify that the inputs are identical in the *.inp including power usage and schedules.  Sometimes the schedules can be input differently by accident when using the wizard if you are making two separate project files.  (This shouldn't change if you are only using the EEM parametric features.)

First, I feel that the statement that EAC1 methodology "penalizes air barrier suppliers" and "rewards concrete block producers" is completely off-base.  These are not either/or technologies.  There are many other factors going into the selection of these items besides energy performance.  If there is real energy and maintenance savings justification as an investment, then owners will consider it even without contributing to EAC1.  LEED covers many things, but it isn't an exhaustive manual of sustainability.  As well, the LEED process, although growing, still covers only a small fraction of new building projects, regarding Appendix G applicability.  This is an energy modeling forum, so let's focus on the Appendix G part of the discussion.

Specifically for 90.1 energy performance, it isn't a matter of arbitrarily accepting one or the other - we as an energy modeling community have many years of experience and research involved in accurately modeling the heat transfer in envelope components.  The capability of various modeling techniques have been demonstrated to be capable of relatively accurate modeling of the differences between thermal mass and insulation levels for many years, therefore these calculations are included in the standard as a path of calculating energy usage and savings between alternatives.

The modeling software are generally able to predict what would happen due to a given change in level of infiltration.  The modeling improvements need to be made in the area of showing that the calculations are accurate in determining those levels, rather than using a specified reduction.  Does the software available have the needed parameters to model a product such as yours?  On a case-by-case basis you may be able to show that you know all of the needed parameters to make these calculations.  I'm not sure if you could apply these to all projects, and all software packages though.  For instance, do you feel that your product has different effectiveness than other brands?  How would someone capture these differences in efficiency in eQuest or EnergyPlus?  Would it be okay with the USGBC to propose a straight percentage reduction?  What's the starting point for the base case?  How much variability is there in the construction process?

Your input would be welcomed if you offer some expertise in these areas.

You mention a study that shows benefits in many cases for 116 buildings (and common sense would agree with this).  Some focus should be on educating designers to use the strategy and contractors on proper installation, regardless of the "points" that are achieved, and under what conditions the strategy would be most effective.

Just my $0.02.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Air leakage, LEED, and Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) did an extensive study documenting a greater than 40% natural gas savings and a greater than 25% electricity savings across the nation for building energy consumption if buildings were uniformly constructed with air barrier systems installed.  They evaluated 116 existing buildings and computer modeled several different building types.  The purpose of their study was to provide information to ASHRAE concerning whether it would be desirable to add an air barrier requirement to ASHRAE 90.1.

As a result, I've always thought that Appendix G to ASHRAE 90.1 allows you to change the air leakage rate off the default and onto a rate corresponding to an air barrier installation, so that you could claim LEED points for the corresponding energy savings.  However, an architect at a presentation I did said you could not do that under the LEED and ASHRAE requirements.  (I know the models will do it, because I've done it on the TRANE model and obtained results that support the NIST findings.)

I see in Appendix G that:  "G3.1.2.5. Ventilation.  Minimum outdoor air ventilation rates shall be the same for the proposed and baseline building designs."  However, I searched the document for "outdoor air ventilation" and the phrase occurs only in the context of mechanical systems that are designed to intentionally bring air into the building.  If this section is the basis for concluding that air leakage barriers should be left out of the modeling, then I have trouble understanding why.

Appendix G says that all components of the building are to be modeled as designed.  That would preclude modeling as if an air barrier system did not exist in the design.  It says the baseline building model is to have steel-framed above-grade walls, and it is silent about the design building, but the User's Manual says that if the design building walls are block or cast concrete, then "the mass is credited in the building performance rating method."  Likewise, if the walls are wood stud instead of steel, then the Manual says credit is given for the superior energy performance of wood frame versus steel frame.  The User's Manual states that it:  "Offers information on the intent and application of Standard 90.1."  Given these examples in the Manual based on existing thermal mass energy-saving data and wood-versus-steel stud energy data, it is difficult to conclude that a wall that is constructed with materials meeting the air leakage limits and installation requirements of the Air Barrier Association of America and determined to produce significant energy savings by the NIST study based on those same limits and requirements should be modeled as if it leaked air like a building without an air barrier.

Please let me know what you think, and if you know of any reason why it is not proper to change the air leakage rate through the building envelope in the design model to show the benefit of air barriers.

Message-ID: <cdf76d820908241446u2cde55a5j80eff1ce885427ee@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Has anyone tried to utilize geometry information from an existing
eQUEST/DOE-2 model's input file to create geometry for a Radiance
daylighting model in the *.RAD file format? (without having to build the
geometry again from scratch I mean)

Theoretically I could come up with the following route but haven't tested it
yet:
Export *.INP to *.IDF using DrawBDL ?> open the IDF file using OpenStudio in
Sketch UP -->  export to Radiance file format *.RAD using the Sketch Up
 plugin SU2RAD.

Any ideas? Thanks,

I don't think any of us disagree that there are significant benefits to be
had by having tighter buildings. 

 

Part of the issue is the lack of a documented base line here in the US.  I'm
not aware of any (enforced or otherwise) baseline that is required and/or
published.  Does anyone else have that data?

 

Additionally, projects are not required, at this point in time, to
demonstrate or document air leakage rates after construction.  So that is
typically leaving us with two variables in a model that are based on the
modeler's best judgment.  Understanding many things in the model are the
'modelers best judgment', at this point, we need more to go on.

 

 My unofficial two cents.

 

The good thing about this is there's always room for improvement and there
are a good many, very well intentioned volunteers working on improving the
system.

Dear Paul, et al

 

I have to agree with Paul's comments on this one.

 

We can and have to take account of infiltration reductions within our UK
building regulations calculations and indeed in certain circumstances they
can be the difference between different grades for the buildings when
thermal mass and other passive design techniques or super efficient HVAC
systems have been taken into account.

 

At the design stage you "choose" an infiltration rate that the design team
is willing to take the risk on achieving and if not you can use a default
infiltration rate which equates to a reasonably well built modern building
(this obviously gets reviewed and reduced a little over time to increase the
requirements).  The key to it being that in order for the builder to obtain
the building regulations and occupation certificates, the actual measured
air infiltration rates have to be put into the design simulation model post
build to ensure that what the design team has said will be achieved, is
actually achieved.  In fact it is possibly at the moment one of the most
successful parts of our regulations.

 

This has 2 main benefits, it means that contractors have to think about the
quality of their build and good detailing from the start and subsequently if
they allow a poor building to be built that exceeds the minimum standards or
their chosen design value, they have to go and identify the air leakage
paths and bring the building up to that standard before they can get an
occupation certificate.

 

When you consider that our default air leakage rate is 10m3/hr and we see
many large commercial warehousing projects (a good example where composite
panels are often used for air tight seals) that have leakage rates of less
than 2m3/hr.m2 it is possible to see that large benefits might be possible
in some instances.  On a large warehouse with perhaps background heating for
the operatives, this reduction in infiltration can result in very large
reductions in energy use/carbon emissions for heating, etc.

 

I am slightly surprised that a USGBC/ASHRAE baseline rate doesn't exist to
allow benefits to be taken into account, especially when it is possible to
use the test results to enforce improvements to be made, in a way it acts as
both carrot and stick.

 

Regards

Paul

My understanding is that one of the co-founders of the Air Barrier
Association of America is actively involved with the committee, and I have
an e-mail from him confirming that reduction in air leakage can be modeled
and the energy savings used in the award of LEED points.

 

However, given the contrary position I am hearing, I am beginning to become
concerned that some approach other than begging ASHRAE and USGBC to be
reasonable needs to be considered.

I am sure there is just as much baseline for air leakage reduction benefit
as there is for the concrete walls and wooden studs that the User's Manual
says can be modeled and their energy savings captured for inclusion in the
overall modeling results.

 

I cannot accept that the USGBC and ASHRAE can arbitrarily say reduction in
air leakage will not be considered, but that increases in thermal mass
energy-savings from using concrete walls or energy benefits from using
wooden studs will be used to compute building energy performance.  This
obviously rewards concrete block producers and wood stud suppliers and
penalizes air barrier suppliers.  

 

I'm reminded of Lord Acton's famous observation:  "Power corrupts, and
absolute power corrupts absolutely."  Fortunately, even the power of
organizations like ASHRAE and USGBC are subject to some ultimate check.
Such organizations are prohibited by law from arbitrary practices that favor
one group over another.  Below are excerpts from the leading United States
Supreme Court case on the subject.

American Society of Mechanical Engineers. Inc. v. Hydrolevel Corporation, 

456 U.S. 556, 102 S.Ct. 1935, 72 L.Ed.2d. 330

(1982), Supreme Court Justice Blackmun, writing for the majority:

 

"Furthermore, a standard setting organization like ASME can be rife with

opportunities for anti competitive activity. Many of ASME's officials are

associated with members of the industries regulated by ASME's codes.

Although, undoubtedly, most serve ASME without concern for the interests of

their corporate employers, some may well view their positions with ASME, at

least in part, as an opportunity to benefit their employers. When the great

influence of ASME's reputation is placed at their disposal, the less
altruistic of

ASME's agents have an opportunity to harm their employers' competitors

through manipulation of ASME's codes."

ID.., at 571, 102 S.Ct., at 1946.

 

In American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed
a jury

verdict that awarded treble damages to the company that was injured by
certain members of the

trade organization that had manipulated the trade organization and its role
in the industry to set

standards designed to enrich those members' corporation and diminish the
ability of its

competitors to fairly compete in the marketplace. In deciding to hold the
trade organization

responsible for the actions of its members, the Court explained:

 

"It is true that imposing liability on ASME's agents themselves will have
some

deterrent effect, because they will know that if they violate antitrust laws
through

their participation in ASME, they risk the consequences of personal civil
liability.

But if, in addition, ASME is civilly liable for the antitrust violations of
its agents

acting with apparent authority, it is much more likely that similar
antitrust

violation will not occur in the future. "Pressure will be brought on the

organization to see to it that its agents abide by the law." United States
v. A&P

Trucking Co., 358 U.S. 121, 126, 79 S.Ct. 203, 207, 3 L.Ed.2d 165 (1958).
Only

ASME can take systematic steps to make improper conduct on the part of all
its

agents unlikely, and the possibility of civil liability will inevitably be a
powerful

incentive for ASME to take those steps. Thus, a rule that imposes liability
on the

standard setting organization- which is best situated to prevent antitrust
violations

through the abuse of its reputation-is most faithful to the congressional
intent that

the private right of action deters antitrust violations."

As I understand it the issue is that the 90.1 Standard does not establish a
base line condition for air leakage so no savings can be claimed.  I
certainly agree that the savings are real and should be counted.  I know
that the Appendix G committee has this issue on their extensive "to do"

Dear Bldg-Sim community,
 
On the one hand, Lord Acton was right.
 
On the other hand, my own experience as a member of an ANSI TAG (Technical
Advisory Group) was that the checks and balances normally work acceptably.
My TAG had a couple dozen members, of which about 6 represented equipment
manufacturers (I was one of those).  Each of us equipment folk were very
familiar with each other's competitive advantages and were attentive to
proposals which may have favored one or another of us.  The end result was
essentially fair for all, although one who will remain nameless couldn't be
faulted for effort to bias the standard!
 
Any human effort will be flawed to some extent!
 
USGBC (and ASHRAE) seem to be interested in gradual improvement, so I hope
that infiltration will be one of their targets in the future.  That said,
infiltration is subject to so many details of proper installation that any
modeling effort is unlikely (unable?) to represent it well.

As I understand it the issue is that the 90.1 Standard does not establish a
base line condition for air leakage so no savings can be claimed.  I
certainly agree that the savings are real and should be counted.  I know

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Air leakage, LEED, and Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1

 

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) did an extensive
study documenting a greater than 40% natural gas savings and a greater than
25% electricity savings across the nation for building energy consumption if
buildings were uniformly constructed with air barrier systems installed.
They evaluated 116 existing buildings and computer modeled several different
building types.  The purpose of their study was to provide information to
ASHRAE concerning whether it would be desirable to add an air barrier
requirement to ASHRAE 90.1.

 

As a result, I've always thought that Appendix G to ASHRAE 90.1 allows you
to change the air leakage rate off the default and onto a rate corresponding
to an air barrier installation, so that you could claim LEED points for the
corresponding energy savings.  However, an architect at a presentation I did
said you could not do that under the LEED and ASHRAE requirements.  (I know
the models will do it, because I've done it on the TRANE model and obtained
results that support the NIST findings.)

 

I see in Appendix G that:  "G3.1.2.5. Ventilation.  Minimum outdoor air
ventilation rates shall be the same for the proposed and baseline building
designs."  However, I searched the document for "outdoor air ventilation"
and the phrase occurs only in the context of mechanical systems that are
designed to intentionally bring air into the building.  If this section is
the basis for concluding that air leakage barriers should be left out of the
modeling, then I have trouble understanding why.

 

Appendix G says that all components of the building are to be modeled as
designed.  That would preclude modeling as if an air barrier system did not
exist in the design.  It says the baseline building model is to have
steel-framed above-grade walls, and it is silent about the design building,
but the User's Manual says that if the design building walls are block or
cast concrete, then "the mass is credited in the building performance rating
method."  Likewise, if the walls are wood stud instead of steel, then the
Manual says credit is given for the superior energy performance of wood
frame versus steel frame.  The User's Manual states that it:  "Offers
information on the intent and application of Standard 90.1."  Given these
examples in the Manual based on existing thermal mass energy-saving data and
wood-versus-steel stud energy data, it is difficult to conclude that a wall
that is constructed with materials meeting the air leakage limits and
installation requirements of the Air Barrier Association of America and
determined to produce significant energy savings by the NIST study based on
those same limits and requirements should be modeled as if it leaked air
like a building without an air barrier. 

 

Please let me know what you think, and if you know of any reason why it is
not proper to change the air leakage rate through the building envelope in
the design model to show the benefit of air barriers.

Dear Paul, et al

 

I have to agree with Paul's comments on this one.

 

We can and have to take account of infiltration reductions within our UK
building regulations calculations and indeed in certain circumstances they
can be the difference between different grades for the buildings when
thermal mass and other passive design techniques or super efficient HVAC
systems have been taken into account.

 

At the design stage you "choose" an infiltration rate that the design team
is willing to take the risk on achieving and if not you can use a default
infiltration rate which equates to a reasonably well built modern building
(this obviously gets reviewed and reduced a little over time to increase the
requirements).  The key to it being that in order for the builder to obtain
the building regulations and occupation certificates, the actual measured
air infiltration rates have to be put into the design simulation model post
build to ensure that what the design team has said will be achieved, is
actually achieved.  In fact it is possibly at the moment one of the most
successful parts of our regulations.

 

This has 2 main benefits, it means that contractors have to think about the
quality of their build and good detailing from the start and subsequently if
they allow a poor building to be built that exceeds the minimum standards or
their chosen design value, they have to go and identify the air leakage
paths and bring the building up to that standard before they can get an
occupation certificate.

 

When you consider that our default air leakage rate is 10m3/hr and we see
many large commercial warehousing projects (a good example where composite
panels are often used for air tight seals) that have leakage rates of less
than 2m3/hr.m2 it is possible to see that large benefits might be possible
in some instances.  On a large warehouse with perhaps background heating for
the operatives, this reduction in infiltration can result in very large
reductions in energy use/carbon emissions for heating, etc.

 

I am slightly surprised that a USGBC/ASHRAE baseline rate doesn't exist to
allow benefits to be taken into account, especially when it is possible to
use the test results to enforce improvements to be made, in a way it acts as
both carrot and stick.

 

Regards

Paul

My understanding is that one of the co-founders of the Air Barrier
Association of America is actively involved with the committee, and I have
an e-mail from him confirming that reduction in air leakage can be modeled
and the energy savings used in the award of LEED points.

 

However, given the contrary position I am hearing, I am beginning to become
concerned that some approach other than begging ASHRAE and USGBC to be
reasonable needs to be considered.

I am sure there is just as much baseline for air leakage reduction benefit
as there is for the concrete walls and wooden studs that the User's Manual
says can be modeled and their energy savings captured for inclusion in the
overall modeling results.

 

I cannot accept that the USGBC and ASHRAE can arbitrarily say reduction in
air leakage will not be considered, but that increases in thermal mass
energy-savings from using concrete walls or energy benefits from using
wooden studs will be used to compute building energy performance.  This
obviously rewards concrete block producers and wood stud suppliers and
penalizes air barrier suppliers.  

 

I'm reminded of Lord Acton's famous observation:  "Power corrupts, and
absolute power corrupts absolutely."  Fortunately, even the power of
organizations like ASHRAE and USGBC are subject to some ultimate check.
Such organizations are prohibited by law from arbitrary practices that favor
one group over another.  Below are excerpts from the leading United States
Supreme Court case on the subject. 

 

Paul Grahovac, LEED AP

 

American Society of Mechanical Engineers. Inc. v. Hydrolevel Corporation, 

456 U.S. 556, 102 S.Ct. 1935, 72 L.Ed.2d. 330

(1982), Supreme Court Justice Blackmun, writing for the majority:

 

"Furthermore, a standard setting organization like ASME can be rife with

opportunities for anti competitive activity. Many of ASME's officials are

associated with members of the industries regulated by ASME's codes.

Although, undoubtedly, most serve ASME without concern for the interests of

their corporate employers, some may well view their positions with ASME, at

least in part, as an opportunity to benefit their employers. When the great

influence of ASME's reputation is placed at their disposal, the less
altruistic of

ASME's agents have an opportunity to harm their employers' competitors

through manipulation of ASME's codes."

ID.., at 571, 102 S.Ct., at 1946.

 

In American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed
a jury

verdict that awarded treble damages to the company that was injured by
certain members of the

trade organization that had manipulated the trade organization and its role
in the industry to set

standards designed to enrich those members' corporation and diminish the
ability of its

competitors to fairly compete in the marketplace. In deciding to hold the
trade organization

responsible for the actions of its members, the Court explained:

 

"It is true that imposing liability on ASME's agents themselves will have
some

deterrent effect, because they will know that if they violate antitrust laws
through

their participation in ASME, they risk the consequences of personal civil
liability.

But if, in addition, ASME is civilly liable for the antitrust violations of
its agents

acting with apparent authority, it is much more likely that similar
antitrust

violation will not occur in the future. "Pressure will be brought on the

organization to see to it that its agents abide by the law." United States
v. A&P

Trucking Co., 358 U.S. 121, 126, 79 S.Ct. 203, 207, 3 L.Ed.2d 165 (1958).
Only

ASME can take systematic steps to make improper conduct on the part of all
its

agents unlikely, and the possibility of civil liability will inevitably be a

There is a great free program called Exam Diff that we use to track down

If you are only looking at operating costs, another possibility is that your

you will have subtle differences in operating costs for different end uses.

Hello. I am using the eQuest program and have a problem I'm hoping someone
can help me with.

 

I have reviewed all of the input affecting 'Misc. Equip' energy usage (per
the 'Description of eQuest/DOE-2.2 End Use Reporting Categories') and have
verfied all the inputs for both my Baseline and Proposed buildings are
identical, and that no parametric run parameters modify those inputs, and
yet my outputs remain substantially different.

 

As the LEED reviewers are insisting that my 'process' loads be identical for
both the baseline and proposed buildings, I need to either find a way to
correct the apparent mistake, or find a way to move the portion of the Misc.
Equip output that is changing to a non-process energy meter. (I have been
unable to locate where these particular inputs are assigned to one meter or
another).

In my experience modeling of infiltration has nothing to do with actual infiltration in a constructed building.  How much infiltration results in an actual building is 99.9% construction and 0.1% design and specification.  A well design building to minimize infiltration, with poor attention to details during construction and sloppy workmanship can end up having more infiltration than an average design with a good construction team.

I have looked in many plenums only to see daylight and cold-wintery air flowing into the building, even on LEED projects.

These issues make it very difficult to justify infiltration savings in an energy model.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Air leakage, LEED, and Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) did an extensive study documenting a greater than 40% natural gas savings and a greater than 25% electricity savings across the nation for building energy consumption if buildings were uniformly constructed with air barrier systems installed.  They evaluated 116 existing buildings and computer modeled several different building types.  The purpose of their study was to provide information to ASHRAE concerning whether it would be desirable to add an air barrier requirement to ASHRAE 90.1.

As a result, I've always thought that Appendix G to ASHRAE 90.1 allows you to change the air leakage rate off the default and onto a rate corresponding to an air barrier installation, so that you could claim LEED points for the corresponding energy savings.  However, an architect at a presentation I did said you could not do that under the LEED and ASHRAE requirements.  (I know the models will do it, because I've done it on the TRANE model and obtained results that support the NIST findings.)

I see in Appendix G that:  "G3.1.2.5. Ventilation.  Minimum outdoor air ventilation rates shall be the same for the proposed and baseline building designs."  However, I searched the document for "outdoor air ventilation" and the phrase occurs only in the context of mechanical systems that are designed to intentionally bring air into the building.  If this section is the basis for concluding that air leakage barriers should be left out of the modeling, then I have trouble understanding why.

Appendix G says that all components of the building are to be modeled as designed.  That would preclude modeling as if an air barrier system did not exist in the design.  It says the baseline building model is to have steel-framed above-grade walls, and it is silent about the design building, but the User's Manual says that if the design building walls are block or cast concrete, then "the mass is credited in the building performance rating method."  Likewise, if the walls are wood stud instead of steel, then the Manual says credit is given for the superior energy performance of wood frame versus steel frame.  The User's Manual states that it:  "Offers information on the intent and application of Standard 90.1."  Given these examples in the Manual based on existing thermal mass energy-saving data and wood-versus-steel stud energy data, it is difficult to conclude that a wall that is constructed with materials meeting the air leakage limits and installation requirements of the Air Barrier Association of America and determined to produce significant energy savings by the NIST study based on those same limits and requirements should be modeled as if it leaked air like a building without an air barrier.

Please let me know what you think, and if you know of any reason why it is not proper to change the air leakage rate through the building envelope in the design model to show the benefit of air barriers.

We are attempting to replicate the UK model for some school projects we are
working on.  We established a goal of <0.4 cfm/sf @0.3?wc (good practice
under the UK system) and will require post-construction testing.  

 

A good compendium of links on the subject can be found at -
http://www.infiltec.com/inf-larg.htm   If anyone knows of other
studies/resources it would be great to see them.

 

So some data exists on building performance in this arena and hopefully the
Appendix G folks can come up with a reasonable baseline so we can encourage
more diligent construction practice toward this end.

I don?t think any of us disagree that there are significant benefits to be
had by having tighter buildings. 

 

Part of the issue is the lack of a documented base line here in the US.  I?m
not aware of any (enforced or otherwise) baseline that is required and/or
published.  Does anyone else have that data?

 

Additionally, projects are not required, at this point in time, to
demonstrate or document air leakage rates after construction.  So that is
typically leaving us with two variables in a model that are based on the
modeler?s best judgment.  Understanding many things in the model are the
?modelers best judgment?, at this point, we need more to go on.

 

 My unofficial two cents?

 

The good thing about this is there?s always room for improvement and there
are a good many, very well intentioned volunteers working on improving the
system?

Dear Paul, et al

 

I have to agree with Paul?s comments on this one.

 

We can and have to take account of infiltration reductions within our UK
building regulations calculations and indeed in certain circumstances they
can be the difference between different grades for the buildings when
thermal mass and other passive design techniques or super efficient HVAC
systems have been taken into account.

 

At the design stage you ?choose? an infiltration rate that the design team
is willing to take the risk on achieving and if not you can use a default
infiltration rate which equates to a reasonably well built modern building
(this obviously gets reviewed and reduced a little over time to increase the
requirements).  The key to it being that in order for the builder to obtain
the building regulations and occupation certificates, the actual measured
air infiltration rates have to be put into the design simulation model post
build to ensure that what the design team has said will be achieved, is
actually achieved.  In fact it is possibly at the moment one of the most
successful parts of our regulations.

 

This has 2 main benefits, it means that contractors have to think about the
quality of their build and good detailing from the start and subsequently if
they allow a poor building to be built that exceeds the minimum standards or
their chosen design value, they have to go and identify the air leakage
paths and bring the building up to that standard before they can get an
occupation certificate.

 

When you consider that our default air leakage rate is 10m3/hr and we see
many large commercial warehousing projects (a good example where composite
panels are often used for air tight seals) that have leakage rates of less
than 2m3/hr.m2 it is possible to see that large benefits might be possible
in some instances.  On a large warehouse with perhaps background heating for
the operatives, this reduction in infiltration can result in very large
reductions in energy use/carbon emissions for heating, etc.

 

I am slightly surprised that a USGBC/ASHRAE baseline rate doesn?t exist to
allow benefits to be taken into account, especially when it is possible to
use the test results to enforce improvements to be made, in a way it acts as
both carrot and stick.

 

Regards

Paul

My understanding is that one of the co-founders of the Air Barrier
Association of America is actively involved with the committee, and I have
an e-mail from him confirming that reduction in air leakage can be modeled
and the energy savings used in the award of LEED points.

 

However, given the contrary position I am hearing, I am beginning to become
concerned that some approach other than begging ASHRAE and USGBC to be
reasonable needs to be considered.

I am sure there is just as much baseline for air leakage reduction benefit
as there is for the concrete walls and wooden studs that the User?s Manual
says can be modeled and their energy savings captured for inclusion in the
overall modeling results.

 

I cannot accept that the USGBC and ASHRAE can arbitrarily say reduction in
air leakage will not be considered, but that increases in thermal mass
energy-savings from using concrete walls or energy benefits from using
wooden studs will be used to compute building energy performance.  This
obviously rewards concrete block producers and wood stud suppliers and
penalizes air barrier suppliers.  

 

I?m reminded of Lord Acton?s famous observation:  ?Power corrupts, and
absolute power corrupts absolutely.?  Fortunately, even the power of
organizations like ASHRAE and USGBC are subject to some ultimate check.
Such organizations are prohibited by law from arbitrary practices that favor
one group over another.  Below are excerpts from the leading United States
Supreme Court case on the subject. 

 

Paul Grahovac, LEED AP

 

American Society of Mechanical Engineers. Inc. v. Hydrolevel Corporation, 

456 U.S. 556, 102 S.Ct. 1935, 72 L.Ed.2d. 330

(1982), Supreme Court Justice Blackmun, writing for the majority:

 

?Furthermore, a standard setting organization like ASME can be rife with

opportunities for anti competitive activity. Many of ASME's officials are

associated with members of the industries regulated by ASME's codes.

Although, undoubtedly, most serve ASME without concern for the interests of

their corporate employers, some may well view their positions with ASME, at

least in part, as an opportunity to benefit their employers. When the great

influence of ASME's reputation is placed at their disposal, the less
altruistic of

ASME's agents have an opportunity to harm their employers' competitors

through manipulation of ASME's codes.?

ID.., at 571, 102 S.Ct., at 1946.

 

In American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed
a jury

verdict that awarded treble damages to the company that was injured by
certain members of the

trade organization that had manipulated the trade organization and its role
in the industry to set

standards designed to enrich those members' corporation and diminish the
ability of its

competitors to fairly compete in the marketplace. In deciding to hold the
trade organization

responsible for the actions of its members, the Court explained:

 

?It is true that imposing liability on ASME's agents themselves will have
some

deterrent effect, because they will know that if they violate antitrust laws
through

their participation in ASME, they risk the consequences of personal civil
liability.

But if, in addition, ASME is civilly liable for the antitrust violations of
its agents

acting with apparent authority, it is much more likely that similar
antitrust

violation will not occur in the future. "Pressure will be brought on the

organization to see to it that its agents abide by the law." United States
v. A&P

Trucking Co., 358 U.S. 121, 126, 79 S.Ct. 203, 207, 3 L.Ed.2d 165 (1958).
Only

ASME can take systematic steps to make improper conduct on the part of all
its

agents unlikely, and the possibility of civil liability will inevitably be a
powerful

incentive for ASME to take those steps. Thus, a rule that imposes liability
on the

standard setting organization- which is best situated to prevent antitrust
violations

through the abuse of its reputation-is most faithful to the congressional
intent that

the private right of action deters antitrust violations.?

14:., at 572-573, 102 S.Ct., at 1946.

The Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre (AIVC -  <http://www.aivc.org>
www.aivc.org) has published a number of documents regarding infiltration and
ventilation rates in buildings, though perhaps the most useful I have found
is the:

 

"Ventilation Modelling Data Guide", Orme & Leksmono, 2002, ISBN 2 9600355 2
6 - This guide book GU5 according to the website, comes from an update to
the old technical document "Numerical Data for Air Infiltration and Natural
Ventilation Calculations" which I have used for a number of years when
carrying out advanced modelling of infiltration.  I don't have the update,
but the original book I have is still useful with infiltration rates given
for a variety of materials and constructions that may well be a good
starting point for compiling a baseline.

 

The BRE have published a few things about infiltration and certainly
post-construction testing, as have BSRIA.

 

Post-Construction testing is the key to this working as Jon Evans rightly
pointed out.  It isn't much good assuming something then getting it built
poorly.  This is a way of pulling up the performance of contractors and has
a way of sifting out the cowboys to some extent.

 

The other place that you might find useful information would be the
International Journal of Ventilation, where the editorial board reads like a
who's who of ventilation research -  http://www.ijovent.org.uk/index.html

We are attempting to replicate the UK model for some school projects we are
working on.  We established a goal of <0.4 cfm/sf @0.3"wc (good practice
under the UK system) and will require post-construction testing.  

 

A good compendium of links on the subject can be found at -
http://www.infiltec.com/inf-larg.htm   If anyone knows of other
studies/resources it would be great to see them.

 

So some data exists on building performance in this arena and hopefully the
Appendix G folks can come up with a reasonable baseline so we can encourage
more diligent construction practice toward this end.

I don't think any of us disagree that there are significant benefits to be
had by having tighter buildings. 

 

Part of the issue is the lack of a documented base line here in the US.  I'm
not aware of any (enforced or otherwise) baseline that is required and/or
published.  Does anyone else have that data?

 

Additionally, projects are not required, at this point in time, to
demonstrate or document air leakage rates after construction.  So that is
typically leaving us with two variables in a model that are based on the
modeler's best judgment.  Understanding many things in the model are the
'modelers best judgment', at this point, we need more to go on.

 

 My unofficial two cents.

 

The good thing about this is there's always room for improvement and there
are a good many, very well intentioned volunteers working on improving the
system.

Dear Paul, et al

 

I have to agree with Paul's comments on this one.

 

We can and have to take account of infiltration reductions within our UK
building regulations calculations and indeed in certain circumstances they
can be the difference between different grades for the buildings when
thermal mass and other passive design techniques or super efficient HVAC
systems have been taken into account.

 

At the design stage you "choose" an infiltration rate that the design team
is willing to take the risk on achieving and if not you can use a default
infiltration rate which equates to a reasonably well built modern building
(this obviously gets reviewed and reduced a little over time to increase the
requirements).  The key to it being that in order for the builder to obtain
the building regulations and occupation certificates, the actual measured
air infiltration rates have to be put into the design simulation model post
build to ensure that what the design team has said will be achieved, is
actually achieved.  In fact it is possibly at the moment one of the most
successful parts of our regulations.

 

This has 2 main benefits, it means that contractors have to think about the
quality of their build and good detailing from the start and subsequently if
they allow a poor building to be built that exceeds the minimum standards or
their chosen design value, they have to go and identify the air leakage
paths and bring the building up to that standard before they can get an
occupation certificate.

 

When you consider that our default air leakage rate is 10m3/hr and we see
many large commercial warehousing projects (a good example where composite
panels are often used for air tight seals) that have leakage rates of less
than 2m3/hr.m2 it is possible to see that large benefits might be possible
in some instances.  On a large warehouse with perhaps background heating for
the operatives, this reduction in infiltration can result in very large
reductions in energy use/carbon emissions for heating, etc.

 

I am slightly surprised that a USGBC/ASHRAE baseline rate doesn't exist to
allow benefits to be taken into account, especially when it is possible to
use the test results to enforce improvements to be made, in a way it acts as
both carrot and stick.

 

Regards

Paul

My understanding is that one of the co-founders of the Air Barrier
Association of America is actively involved with the committee, and I have
an e-mail from him confirming that reduction in air leakage can be modeled
and the energy savings used in the award of LEED points.

 

However, given the contrary position I am hearing, I am beginning to become
concerned that some approach other than begging ASHRAE and USGBC to be
reasonable needs to be considered.

I am sure there is just as much baseline for air leakage reduction benefit
as there is for the concrete walls and wooden studs that the User's Manual
says can be modeled and their energy savings captured for inclusion in the
overall modeling results.

 

I cannot accept that the USGBC and ASHRAE can arbitrarily say reduction in
air leakage will not be considered, but that increases in thermal mass
energy-savings from using concrete walls or energy benefits from using
wooden studs will be used to compute building energy performance.  This
obviously rewards concrete block producers and wood stud suppliers and
penalizes air barrier suppliers.  

 

I'm reminded of Lord Acton's famous observation:  "Power corrupts, and
absolute power corrupts absolutely."  Fortunately, even the power of
organizations like ASHRAE and USGBC are subject to some ultimate check.
Such organizations are prohibited by law from arbitrary practices that favor
one group over another.  Below are excerpts from the leading United States
Supreme Court case on the subject. 

 

Paul Grahovac, LEED AP

 

American Society of Mechanical Engineers. Inc. v. Hydrolevel Corporation, 

456 U.S. 556, 102 S.Ct. 1935, 72 L.Ed.2d. 330

(1982), Supreme Court Justice Blackmun, writing for the majority:

 

"Furthermore, a standard setting organization like ASME can be rife with

opportunities for anti competitive activity. Many of ASME's officials are

associated with members of the industries regulated by ASME's codes.

Although, undoubtedly, most serve ASME without concern for the interests of

their corporate employers, some may well view their positions with ASME, at

least in part, as an opportunity to benefit their employers. When the great

influence of ASME's reputation is placed at their disposal, the less
altruistic of

ASME's agents have an opportunity to harm their employers' competitors

through manipulation of ASME's codes."

ID.., at 571, 102 S.Ct., at 1946.

 

In American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed
a jury

verdict that awarded treble damages to the company that was injured by
certain members of the

trade organization that had manipulated the trade organization and its role
in the industry to set

standards designed to enrich those members' corporation and diminish the
ability of its

competitors to fairly compete in the marketplace. In deciding to hold the
trade organization

responsible for the actions of its members, the Court explained:

 

"It is true that imposing liability on ASME's agents themselves will have
some

deterrent effect, because they will know that if they violate antitrust laws
through

their participation in ASME, they risk the consequences of personal civil
liability.

But if, in addition, ASME is civilly liable for the antitrust violations of
its agents

acting with apparent authority, it is much more likely that similar
antitrust

violation will not occur in the future. "Pressure will be brought on the

organization to see to it that its agents abide by the law." United States
v. A&P

Trucking Co., 358 U.S. 121, 126, 79 S.Ct. 203, 207, 3 L.Ed.2d 165 (1958).
Only

ASME can take systematic steps to make improper conduct on the part of all
its

agents unlikely, and the possibility of civil liability will inevitably be a
powerful

incentive for ASME to take those steps. Thus, a rule that imposes liability
on the

standard setting organization- which is best situated to prevent antitrust
violations

through the abuse of its reputation-is most faithful to the congressional
intent that

the private right of action deters antitrust violations."

As I understand it the issue is that the 90.1 Standard does not establish a
base line condition for air leakage so no savings can be claimed.  I
certainly agree that the savings are real and should be counted.  I know
that the Appendix G committee has this issue on their extensive "to do"

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Air leakage, LEED, and Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1

 

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) did an extensive
study documenting a greater than 40% natural gas savings and a greater than
25% electricity savings across the nation for building energy consumption if
buildings were uniformly constructed with air barrier systems installed.
They evaluated 116 existing buildings and computer modeled several different
building types.  The purpose of their study was to provide information to
ASHRAE concerning whether it would be desirable to add an air barrier
requirement to ASHRAE 90.1.

 

As a result, I've always thought that Appendix G to ASHRAE 90.1 allows you
to change the air leakage rate off the default and onto a rate corresponding
to an air barrier installation, so that you could claim LEED points for the
corresponding energy savings.  However, an architect at a presentation I did
said you could not do that under the LEED and ASHRAE requirements.  (I know
the models will do it, because I've done it on the TRANE model and obtained
results that support the NIST findings.)

 

I see in Appendix G that:  "G3.1.2.5. Ventilation.  Minimum outdoor air
ventilation rates shall be the same for the proposed and baseline building
designs."  However, I searched the document for "outdoor air ventilation"
and the phrase occurs only in the context of mechanical systems that are
designed to intentionally bring air into the building.  If this section is
the basis for concluding that air leakage barriers should be left out of the
modeling, then I have trouble understanding why.

 

Appendix G says that all components of the building are to be modeled as
designed.  That would preclude modeling as if an air barrier system did not
exist in the design.  It says the baseline building model is to have
steel-framed above-grade walls, and it is silent about the design building,
but the User's Manual says that if the design building walls are block or
cast concrete, then "the mass is credited in the building performance rating
method."  Likewise, if the walls are wood stud instead of steel, then the
Manual says credit is given for the superior energy performance of wood
frame versus steel frame.  The User's Manual states that it:  "Offers
information on the intent and application of Standard 90.1."  Given these
examples in the Manual based on existing thermal mass energy-saving data and
wood-versus-steel stud energy data, it is difficult to conclude that a wall
that is constructed with materials meeting the air leakage limits and
installation requirements of the Air Barrier Association of America and
determined to produce significant energy savings by the NIST study based on
those same limits and requirements should be modeled as if it leaked air
like a building without an air barrier. 

 

Please let me know what you think, and if you know of any reason why it is
not proper to change the air leakage rate through the building envelope in
the design model to show the benefit of air barriers.

 

Thanks,

off-base.  These are not either/or technologies.  There are many other
factors going into the selection of these items besides energy

justification as an investment, then owners will consider it even
without contributing to EAC1.  LEED covers many things, but it isn't an
exhaustive manual of sustainability.  As well, the LEED process,
although growing, still covers only a small fraction of new building
projects, regarding Appendix G applicability.  This is an energy
modeling forum, so let's focus on the Appendix G part of the discussion.

 

Specifically for 90.1 energy performance, it isn't a matter of
arbitrarily accepting one or the other - we as an energy modeling
community have many years of experience and research involved in
accurately modeling the heat transfer in envelope components.  The
capability of various modeling techniques have been demonstrated to be
capable of relatively accurate modeling of the differences between
thermal mass and insulation levels for many years, therefore these
calculations are included in the standard as a path of calculating
energy usage and savings between alternatives.

 

The modeling software are generally able to predict what would happen
due to a given change in level of infiltration.  The modeling
improvements need to be made in the area of showing that the
calculations are accurate in determining those levels, rather than using
a specified reduction.  Does the software available have the needed
parameters to model a product such as yours?  On a case-by-case basis
you may be able to show that you know all of the needed parameters to
make these calculations.  I'm not sure if you could apply these to all
projects, and all software packages though.  For instance, do you feel
that your product has different effectiveness than other brands?  How
would someone capture these differences in efficiency in eQuest or
EnergyPlus?  Would it be okay with the USGBC to propose a straight
percentage reduction?  What's the starting point for the base case?  How
much variability is there in the construction process?

 

Your input would be welcomed if you offer some expertise in these areas.

 

You mention a study that shows benefits in many cases for 116 buildings
(and common sense would agree with this).  Some focus should be on
educating designers to use the strategy and contractors on proper
installation, regardless of the "points" that are achieved, and under
what conditions the strategy would be most effective.

I am sure there is just as much baseline for air leakage reduction
benefit as there is for the concrete walls and wooden studs that the
User's Manual says can be modeled and their energy savings captured for
inclusion in the overall modeling results.

 

I cannot accept that the USGBC and ASHRAE can arbitrarily say reduction
in air leakage will not be considered, but that increases in thermal
mass energy-savings from using concrete walls or energy benefits from
using wooden studs will be used to compute building energy performance.
This obviously rewards concrete block producers and wood stud suppliers
and penalizes air barrier suppliers.  

 

I'm reminded of Lord Acton's famous observation:  "Power corrupts, and
absolute power corrupts absolutely."  Fortunately, even the power of
organizations like ASHRAE and USGBC are subject to some ultimate check.
Such organizations are prohibited by law from arbitrary practices that
favor one group over another.  Below are excerpts from the leading

As I understand it the issue is that the 90.1 Standard does not
establish a base line condition for air leakage so no savings can be
claimed.  I certainly agree that the savings are real and should be
counted.  I know that the Appendix G committee has this issue on their

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Air leakage, LEED, and Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1

 

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) did an
extensive study documenting a greater than 40% natural gas savings and a
greater than 25% electricity savings across the nation for building
energy consumption if buildings were uniformly constructed with air
barrier systems installed.  They evaluated 116 existing buildings and
computer modeled several different building types.  The purpose of their
study was to provide information to ASHRAE concerning whether it would
be desirable to add an air barrier requirement to ASHRAE 90.1.

 

As a result, I've always thought that Appendix G to ASHRAE 90.1 allows
you to change the air leakage rate off the default and onto a rate
corresponding to an air barrier installation, so that you could claim
LEED points for the corresponding energy savings.  However, an architect
at a presentation I did said you could not do that under the LEED and
ASHRAE requirements.  (I know the models will do it, because I've done
it on the TRANE model and obtained results that support the NIST
findings.)

 

I see in Appendix G that:  "G3.1.2.5. Ventilation.  Minimum outdoor air
ventilation rates shall be the same for the proposed and baseline
building designs."  However, I searched the document for "outdoor air
ventilation" and the phrase occurs only in the context of mechanical
systems that are designed to intentionally bring air into the building.
If this section is the basis for concluding that air leakage barriers
should be left out of the modeling, then I have trouble understanding
why.

 

Appendix G says that all components of the building are to be modeled as
designed.  That would preclude modeling as if an air barrier system did
not exist in the design.  It says the baseline building model is to have
steel-framed above-grade walls, and it is silent about the design
building, but the User's Manual says that if the design building walls
are block or cast concrete, then "the mass is credited in the building
performance rating method."  Likewise, if the walls are wood stud
instead of steel, then the Manual says credit is given for the superior
energy performance of wood frame versus steel frame.  The User's Manual
states that it:  "Offers information on the intent and application of
Standard 90.1."  Given these examples in the Manual based on existing
thermal mass energy-saving data and wood-versus-steel stud energy data,
it is difficult to conclude that a wall that is constructed with
materials meeting the air leakage limits and installation requirements
of the Air Barrier Association of America and determined to produce
significant energy savings by the NIST study based on those same limits
and requirements should be modeled as if it leaked air like a building
without an air barrier. 

 

Please let me know what you think, and if you know of any reason why it
is not proper to change the air leakage rate through the building
envelope in the design model to show the benefit of air barriers.

Paul,

 

I am a member of the ASHRAE Standard 90.1 Energy Cost Budget Committee
which is responsible for the modeling rules in Appendix G. As far as I
know there have not been any continuous maintenance proposals submitted
to our committee to change the way building leakage is modeled. If there
were such a proposal, the ANSI rules that Standard 90.1 operates under
would require some sort of action (I do not know what the time frame for
that is). There has been a proposal to 90.1 Chapter 5 (Building
Envelope) to require a continuous air barrier which has been out for
several rounds of public review. If that proposal ever gets approved,
Appendix G may need to make changes in the rules for modeling air
infiltration.

 

There is currently nothing in Appendix G that would prohibit someone
from using an exceptional calculation to gain credit for reductions in
building leakage. It would simply be up to the user to demonstrate that
they are doing something in excess of standard practice, and that their
calculations are accurate. Remember that LEED CIR rulings are totally
separate from ASHRAE and under LEED, credit may not be allowed. 

 

On a final note, there is not one member of the ECB subcommittee that
makes his living as a consulting engineer designing HVAC systems, so we
have no financial incentive to ignore a proposal affecting the modeling
of infiltration as you are insinuating in item number 6.

 

Mike

First, I feel that the statement that EAC1 methodology "penalizes air
barrier suppliers" and "rewards concrete block producers" is completely
off-base.  These are not either/or technologies.  There are many other
factors going into the selection of these items besides energy
performance.  If there is real energy and maintenance savings
justification as an investment, then owners will consider it even
without contributing to EAC1.  LEED covers many things, but it isn't an
exhaustive manual of sustainability.  As well, the LEED process,
although growing, still covers only a small fraction of new building
projects, regarding Appendix G applicability.  This is an energy
modeling forum, so let's focus on the Appendix G part of the discussion.

 

Specifically for 90.1 energy performance, it isn't a matter of
arbitrarily accepting one or the other - we as an energy modeling
community have many years of experience and research involved in
accurately modeling the heat transfer in envelope components.  The
capability of various modeling techniques have been demonstrated to be
capable of relatively accurate modeling of the differences between
thermal mass and insulation levels for many years, therefore these
calculations are included in the standard as a path of calculating
energy usage and savings between alternatives.

 

The modeling software are generally able to predict what would happen
due to a given change in level of infiltration.  The modeling
improvements need to be made in the area of showing that the
calculations are accurate in determining those levels, rather than using
a specified reduction.  Does the software available have the needed
parameters to model a product such as yours?  On a case-by-case basis
you may be able to show that you know all of the needed parameters to
make these calculations.  I'm not sure if you could apply these to all
projects, and all software packages though.  For instance, do you feel
that your product has different effectiveness than other brands?  How
would someone capture these differences in efficiency in eQuest or
EnergyPlus?  Would it be okay with the USGBC to propose a straight
percentage reduction?  What's the starting point for the base case?  How
much variability is there in the construction process?

 

Your input would be welcomed if you offer some expertise in these areas.

 

You mention a study that shows benefits in many cases for 116 buildings
(and common sense would agree with this).  Some focus should be on
educating designers to use the strategy and contractors on proper
installation, regardless of the "points" that are achieved, and under
what conditions the strategy would be most effective.

I am sure there is just as much baseline for air leakage reduction
benefit as there is for the concrete walls and wooden studs that the
User's Manual says can be modeled and their energy savings captured for
inclusion in the overall modeling results.

 

I cannot accept that the USGBC and ASHRAE can arbitrarily say reduction
in air leakage will not be considered, but that increases in thermal
mass energy-savings from using concrete walls or energy benefits from
using wooden studs will be used to compute building energy performance.
This obviously rewards concrete block producers and wood stud suppliers
and penalizes air barrier suppliers.  

 

I'm reminded of Lord Acton's famous observation:  "Power corrupts, and
absolute power corrupts absolutely."  Fortunately, even the power of
organizations like ASHRAE and USGBC are subject to some ultimate check.
Such organizations are prohibited by law from arbitrary practices that

But if, in addition, ASME is civilly liable for the antitrust violations

As I understand it the issue is that the 90.1 Standard does not
establish a base line condition for air leakage so no savings can be
claimed.  I certainly agree that the savings are real and should be
counted.  I know that the Appendix G committee has this issue on their

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Air leakage, LEED, and Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1

 

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) did an
extensive study documenting a greater than 40% natural gas savings and a
greater than 25% electricity savings across the nation for building
energy consumption if buildings were uniformly constructed with air
barrier systems installed.  They evaluated 116 existing buildings and
computer modeled several different building types.  The purpose of their
study was to provide information to ASHRAE concerning whether it would
be desirable to add an air barrier requirement to ASHRAE 90.1.

 

As a result, I've always thought that Appendix G to ASHRAE 90.1 allows
you to change the air leakage rate off the default and onto a rate
corresponding to an air barrier installation, so that you could claim
LEED points for the corresponding energy savings.  However, an architect
at a presentation I did said you could not do that under the LEED and
ASHRAE requirements.  (I know the models will do it, because I've done
it on the TRANE model and obtained results that support the NIST
findings.)

 

I see in Appendix G that:  "G3.1.2.5. Ventilation.  Minimum outdoor air
ventilation rates shall be the same for the proposed and baseline
building designs."  However, I searched the document for "outdoor air
ventilation" and the phrase occurs only in the context of mechanical
systems that are designed to intentionally bring air into the building.
If this section is the basis for concluding that air leakage barriers
should be left out of the modeling, then I have trouble understanding
why.

 

Appendix G says that all components of the building are to be modeled as
designed.  That would preclude modeling as if an air barrier system did
not exist in the design.  It says the baseline building model is to have
steel-framed above-grade walls, and it is silent about the design
building, but the User's Manual says that if the design building walls
are block or cast concrete, then "the mass is credited in the building
performance rating method."  Likewise, if the walls are wood stud
instead of steel, then the Manual says credit is given for the superior
energy performance of wood frame versus steel frame.  The User's Manual
states that it:  "Offers information on the intent and application of
Standard 90.1."  Given these examples in the Manual based on existing
thermal mass energy-saving data and wood-versus-steel stud energy data,
it is difficult to conclude that a wall that is constructed with
materials meeting the air leakage limits and installation requirements
of the Air Barrier Association of America and determined to produce
significant energy savings by the NIST study based on those same limits
and requirements should be modeled as if it leaked air like a building
without an air barrier. 

 

Please let me know what you think, and if you know of any reason why it
is not proper to change the air leakage rate through the building
envelope in the design model to show the benefit of air barriers.

 

Thanks,

not exist in the design.  It says the baseline building model is to have
steel-framed above-grade walls, and it is silent about the design
building, but the User's Manual says that if the design building walls
are block or cast concrete, then "the mass is credited in the building
performance rating method."  Likewise, if the walls are wood stud
instead of steel, then the Manual says credit is given for the superior
energy performance of wood frame versus steel frame.  The User's Manual
states that it:  "Offers information on the intent and application of
Standard 90.1."  Given these examples in the Manual based on existing
thermal mass energy-saving data and wood-versus-steel stud energy data,
it is difficult to conclude that a wall that is constructed with
materials meeting the air leakage limits and installation requirements
of the Air Barrier Association of America and determined to produce
significant energy savings by the NIST study based on those same limits
and requirements should be modeled as if it leaked air like a building
without an air barrier. 

 

Please let me know what you think, and if you know of any reason why it
is not proper to change the air leakage rate through the building
envelope in the design model to show the benefit of air barriers.

Hello Sara,

Jeddah is the closest city with a similar climate.  Makkah is only about 70 
km inland from Jeddah and at the same latitude.  The annual heating and 
cooling degree days (base 18C) for Jeddah are 0 and 3656 respectively, and 
for Makkah, are 0 and 4651 respectively.  While the coolest months have very 
similar temperatures, the summer months are somewhat warmer in Makkah, 
possibly because of being located between two mountain ranges, and thus 
explaining the greater number of annual cooling degree days.  The humidity 
records show Makkah to have slightly higher DPs in the winter but somewhat 
lower DPs in the summer months.

I have generated TMY2 datasets for 6 cities in Saudi Arabia, based on 
statistical records covering 25 to 30 years.  I'm not aware of what format 
eQuest uses, but if you are willing to use the TMY2 file generated for 
Makkah, you are welcome to try it (see the TMY2 attachment.)  Based on the 
interchange that's taken place on the BLDG-SIM listserv, I'm guessing that 
this may be as reliable information as you will have access to.  You can 
find most of the temperature and humidity data that I used as input to the 
TMY2 generation model at the web site:  "en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca"  For 
solar radiation, I used the same values as were available for Jeddah (from 
the WMO.)

If you have need for the other cities, they are: Dhahran, Jeddah, Khamis 
Mushait, Riyadh (air base), and Tabouk.

You can best view the attached files with Microsoft WordPad.

All,
Enermodal Engineering near downtown Denver has an opening for a 'building
energy engineer'.  We're a 14-person office of energy consultants,
commissioning agents, and LEED consultants.  The office is very
laid-back....dogs and flip-flops are embraced.  We are also known throughout
Canada and the States for our consulting work and research in building
energy efficiency, and are looking for a top-notch engineer with excellent
written and verbal communication skills.

The Building Energy Engineer opening requires a minimum of two years
professional experience in energy modeling of commercial buildings for LEED,
with experience managing projects a big plus. The position also requires an
undergraduate degree in mechanical, electrical, or architectural
engineering. Responsibilities include computer modeling of energy,
daylighting and thermal performance of buildings and building assemblies,
communicating analysis results in written reports, coordinating the energy
analysis process with architectural design teams, and possibly managing
junior engineers.
A passion for energy efficiency and a writing sample are required.

Interested applicants, please e-mail resume to: JGehring at enermodal.com
Or, contact me with any questions: APappas at enermodal.com

Thanks,
Aleka Pappas

FYI?  We have actual detailed measured data from two recent projects.  By measuring fans, pumps, fan powered VAV boxes, electric heat on VAV boxes, chillers, lighting, etc. and then subtracting all of that off the total building electricity ?. we found that for one of the buildings the misc equip was 10% and the other was closer to 25%.  The misc equipment did include elevators but we didn?t break out elevators separately.  The building with 10% misc equipment loads was a higher education type building with a mix of classrooms and offices.  The building with 25% misc equipment was a 8-5 M-F state office building.  I was kind of surprised that the misc equipment was as high as it was for the office building.  I didn?t think it would get that high? but it was.  Maybe something for the building to work on with their energy management program (i.e. space heaters ???).  It would be nice if we had better or more benchmark data for misc equipment to compare to.  Something for our industry to work on.  If everybody who is doing detailed M&V out there could report the results to a common entity for data sharing, that would be a good idea.  That could give people a range of real numbers to compare to.

You are fortunate that the explanation worked.  I used a very similarly worded explanation for a project I submitted and the reviewer didn't go for it.  "Inconsistency" seems to be the keyword for the review process.

At 03:31 PM 8/21/2009, James V. Dirkes II, PE wrote:

Dear Cramer,

A recent LEED Silver project used this explanation:

"Process load is comprised of receptacles and elevators only, and accounts for slightly less than 17% of the total energy cost.  The receptacle load is assumed to be 0.75 W/sf throughout, which is consistent with ASHRAE 90.1 and reflects the tenants? concern for efficient office equipment. The receptacle loads also use diversity factors that roughly parallel occupancy.  The elevator energy is derived using actual KW and a diversity schedule that reflects normal usage patterns.
The Diversity schedules are shown on the accompanying updated "HVAC Data Summary". These values are based on  actual, designed peak energy use and appropriate diversity.  Therefore, even though somewhat lower than 25% of the total energy cost, we are confident that they reflect the actual situation adequately and should be considered acceptable."

Hi All,
I'm working up a detailed breakdown for process loads in a LEED model, to justify using less than 25% of total. I'm wondering what other people have gotten down to. If you've submitted with lower than 25%, how low did you get, and how detailed was your analysis supporting it? I've got computers and other electronic equipment, task lighting, and I'm working on the elevator. Anything I'm missing? The building is ~50,000 sf, mostly office, but also a workout area (I'm accounting for treadmills but nothing else draws any power).
Thanks,

Message-ID: <006a01ca25de$c4bae2f0$4e30a8d0$@com>

Air leakage reduction of the entire envelope has been brought up on a number
of occasions to the ASHRAE 90.1 committee and to various LEED staff/groups
by a number of people, including me.

 

I believe that the problem is far more fundamental than having a standard
and being able to model changes accurately and more encompassing than
perhaps the focus of these postings.  I personally have never seen one
building, including LEED certified, that when even grossly inspected meets
requirements for air leakage/infiltration let alone a tighter goal.  I am
sure some exist but 10 buildings in the country will not get us there.  It
would be interesting to see ASHRAE measure their new and improved
headquarters air leakage without undertaking a project to tighten it up
first. 

 

The problem is virtually no buildings are built or most certainly none are
remodeled with the inspections and testing necessary to the envelope and
mechanical systems to meet current requirements.  Most designs do not seem
to comprehensively manage air and vapor and certainly do not require proof.

 

At the very least there should be a requirement of provable inspection and
spot barrier testing and a requirement that every building must have the
envelope commissioned prior to issuing an occupancy permit.  This would
drive huge energy savings, carbon reduction, money savings, and reward
material manufacturers and contractors who make it right and build it right.
Owners can not know what they do not know so they have no awareness of the
impacts.  We have actually been involved in projects where a new roof system
is installed that is tight and better insulated and people notice an
increase in the breezes at exterior walls as what used to go out the top now
goes more out the sides.

 

You can get LEED certified (pick a level) and an occupancy permit with
virtually every gasket in your windows/curtain walls leaking air/vapor/even
running water (not performing) with finger size gaps at plenum joints, and,
no air/vapor barrier connection between a buildings? fa?ade and roof systems
but not with a 2 foot square single pane window, crazy.

 

The NIST study and others show that new buildings at the time the studies
were done did not meet code let alone some stricter goal.

 

It is not that the materials and construction processes do not exist.  It is
that to do it right costs more, so it can be done, but not without the
proper inspections and testing.

reduction to enter into LEED point calculations.

 

7.      A change proposal to allow modeling of air leakage reduction has
been pending with the ASHRAE 90.1 simulation group for five months without

(Return of a Hornet's Nest?)

 

First, I feel that the statement that EAC1 methodology ?penalizes air
barrier suppliers? and ?rewards concrete block producers? is completely
off-base.  These are not either/or technologies.  There are many other
factors going into the selection of these items besides energy performance.
If there is real energy and maintenance savings justification as an
investment, then owners will consider it even without contributing to EAC1.
LEED covers many things, but it isn?t an exhaustive manual of
sustainability.  As well, the LEED process, although growing, still covers
only a small fraction of new building projects, regarding Appendix G
applicability.  This is an energy modeling forum, so let?s focus on the
Appendix G part of the discussion.

 

Specifically for 90.1 energy performance, it isn?t a matter of arbitrarily
accepting one or the other ? we as an energy modeling community have many
years of experience and research involved in accurately modeling the heat
transfer in envelope components.  The capability of various modeling
techniques have been demonstrated to be capable of relatively accurate
modeling of the differences between thermal mass and insulation levels for
many years, therefore these calculations are included in the standard as a
path of calculating energy usage and savings between alternatives.

 

The modeling software are generally able to predict what would happen due to
a given change in level of infiltration.  The modeling improvements need to
be made in the area of showing that the calculations are accurate in
determining those levels, rather than using a specified reduction.  Does the
software available have the needed parameters to model a product such as
yours?  On a case-by-case basis you may be able to show that you know all of
the needed parameters to make these calculations.  I?m not sure if you could
apply these to all projects, and all software packages though.  For
instance, do you feel that your product has different effectiveness than
other brands?  How would someone capture these differences in efficiency in
eQuest or EnergyPlus?  Would it be okay with the USGBC to propose a straight
percentage reduction?  What?s the starting point for the base case?  How
much variability is there in the construction process?

 

Your input would be welcomed if you offer some expertise in these areas.

 

You mention a study that shows benefits in many cases for 116 buildings (and
common sense would agree with this).  Some focus should be on educating
designers to use the strategy and contractors on proper installation,
regardless of the ?points? that are achieved, and under what conditions the
strategy would be most effective.

 

Just my $0.02.

I am sure there is just as much baseline for air leakage reduction benefit
as there is for the concrete walls and wooden studs that the User?s Manual
says can be modeled and their energy savings captured for inclusion in the
overall modeling results.

 

I cannot accept that the USGBC and ASHRAE can arbitrarily say reduction in
air leakage will not be considered, but that increases in thermal mass
energy-savings from using concrete walls or energy benefits from using
wooden studs will be used to compute building energy performance.  This
obviously rewards concrete block producers and wood stud suppliers and
penalizes air barrier suppliers.  

 

I?m reminded of Lord Acton?s famous observation:  ?Power corrupts, and
absolute power corrupts absolutely.?  Fortunately, even the power of
organizations like ASHRAE and USGBC are subject to some ultimate check.
Such organizations are prohibited by law from arbitrary practices that favor
one group over another.  Below are excerpts from the leading United States
Supreme Court case on the subject. 

 

Paul Grahovac, LEED AP

 

American Society of Mechanical Engineers. Inc. v. Hydrolevel Corporation, 

456 U.S. 556, 102 S.Ct. 1935, 72 L.Ed.2d. 330

(1982), Supreme Court Justice Blackmun, writing for the majority:

 

?Furthermore, a standard setting organization like ASME can be rife with

opportunities for anti competitive activity. Many of ASME's officials are

associated with members of the industries regulated by ASME's codes.

Although, undoubtedly, most serve ASME without concern for the interests of

their corporate employers, some may well view their positions with ASME, at

least in part, as an opportunity to benefit their employers. When the great

influence of ASME's reputation is placed at their disposal, the less
altruistic of

ASME's agents have an opportunity to harm their employers' competitors

through manipulation of ASME's codes.?

ID.., at 571, 102 S.Ct., at 1946.

 

In American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed
a jury

verdict that awarded treble damages to the company that was injured by
certain members of the

trade organization that had manipulated the trade organization and its role
in the industry to set

standards designed to enrich those members' corporation and diminish the
ability of its

competitors to fairly compete in the marketplace. In deciding to hold the
trade organization

responsible for the actions of its members, the Court explained:

 

?It is true that imposing liability on ASME's agents themselves will have
some

deterrent effect, because they will know that if they violate antitrust laws
through

their participation in ASME, they risk the consequences of personal civil
liability.

But if, in addition, ASME is civilly liable for the antitrust violations of
its agents

acting with apparent authority, it is much more likely that similar
antitrust

violation will not occur in the future. "Pressure will be brought on the

organization to see to it that its agents abide by the law." United States
v. A&P

Trucking Co., 358 U.S. 121, 126, 79 S.Ct. 203, 207, 3 L.Ed.2d 165 (1958).
Only

ASME can take systematic steps to make improper conduct on the part of all
its

agents unlikely, and the possibility of civil liability will inevitably be a
powerful

incentive for ASME to take those steps. Thus, a rule that imposes liability
on the

standard setting organization- which is best situated to prevent antitrust
violations

through the abuse of its reputation-is most faithful to the congressional
intent that

the private right of action deters antitrust violations.?

As I understand it the issue is that the 90.1 Standard does not establish a
base line condition for air leakage so no savings can be claimed.  I
certainly agree that the savings are real and should be counted.  I know

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Air leakage, LEED, and Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1

 

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) did an extensive
study documenting a greater than 40% natural gas savings and a greater than
25% electricity savings across the nation for building energy consumption if
buildings were uniformly constructed with air barrier systems installed.
They evaluated 116 existing buildings and computer modeled several different
building types.  The purpose of their study was to provide information to
ASHRAE concerning whether it would be desirable to add an air barrier
requirement to ASHRAE 90.1.

 

As a result, I?ve always thought that Appendix G to ASHRAE 90.1 allows you
to change the air leakage rate off the default and onto a rate corresponding
to an air barrier installation, so that you could claim LEED points for the
corresponding energy savings.  However, an architect at a presentation I did
said you could not do that under the LEED and ASHRAE requirements.  (I know
the models will do it, because I?ve done it on the TRANE model and obtained
results that support the NIST findings.)

 

I see in Appendix G that:  ?G3.1.2.5. Ventilation.  Minimum outdoor air
ventilation rates shall be the same for the proposed and baseline building
designs.?  However, I searched the document for ?outdoor air ventilation?
and the phrase occurs only in the context of mechanical systems that are
designed to intentionally bring air into the building.  If this section is
the basis for concluding that air leakage barriers should be left out of the
modeling, then I have trouble understanding why.

 

Appendix G says that all components of the building are to be modeled as
designed.  That would preclude modeling as if an air barrier system did not
exist in the design.  It says the baseline building model is to have
steel-framed above-grade walls, and it is silent about the design building,
but the User?s Manual says that if the design building walls are block or
cast concrete, then ?the mass is credited in the building performance rating
method.?  Likewise, if the walls are wood stud instead of steel, then the
Manual says credit is given for the superior energy performance of wood
frame versus steel frame.  The User?s Manual states that it:  ?Offers
information on the intent and application of Standard 90.1.?  Given these
examples in the Manual based on existing thermal mass energy-saving data and
wood-versus-steel stud energy data, it is difficult to conclude that a wall
that is constructed with materials meeting the air leakage limits and
installation requirements of the Air Barrier Association of America and
determined to produce significant energy savings by the NIST study based on
those same limits and requirements should be modeled as if it leaked air
like a building without an air barrier. 

 

Please let me know what you think, and if you know of any reason why it is
not proper to change the air leakage rate through the building envelope in
the design model to show the benefit of air barriers.

The issue that arises is DOE2 geometry is only 2D.  So if DrawBDL is not a
2D to 3D converter you would need to write a ruby subscript in order to
accommodate.  Once you can get the inp* geometry to idf* (2D to 3D) it
should be no problem.  There might be something on the internet that may do
such a thing, but programmers that know how do to such a thing would
probably only take a few days or less to figure it out.

Dear all,

Has anyone tried to utilize geometry information from an existing
eQUEST/DOE-2 model's input file to create geometry for a Radiance
daylighting model in the *.RAD file format? (without having to build the
geometry again from scratch I mean)

Theoretically I could come up with the following route but haven't tested it
yet:
Export *.INP to *.IDF using DrawBDL ?> open the IDF file using OpenStudio in
Sketch UP -->  export to Radiance file format *.RAD using the Sketch Up
plugin SU2RAD.

Any ideas? Thanks,

I agree with Jon's comments about specification of products as being a small
portion of how much infiltration a building will have, not only do
construction practices play a role but also wind profiles on the building,
whether the mechanical systems are controlling building pressure, whether
the building is tall enough to have a stack effect, building shape etc.
Even in performing a winter load calculation and a summer load calculation
we usually change the infiltration rates slightly because average winter
wind speeds are greater than summer wind speeds.

 

If infiltration is going to be accounted for as a savings in energy
modeling, I would think that building leakage testing (similar to duct
leakage testing) and envelope commissioning would need to become more
prominent in our business.  ASHRAE has funded some studies on infiltration
but the data I have seen has been for  residential construction.

In my experience modeling of infiltration has nothing to do with actual
infiltration in a constructed building.  How much infiltration results in an
actual building is 99.9% construction and 0.1% design and specification.  A
well design building to minimize infiltration, with poor attention to
details during construction and sloppy workmanship can end up having more
infiltration than an average design with a good construction team.  

 

I have looked in many plenums only to see daylight and cold-wintery air
flowing into the building, even on LEED projects.

 

These issues make it very difficult to justify infiltration savings in an
energy model.

Hello everyone.

If there is enough interest in this file format I could add an import option
to SU2RAD at some point.
I have not been able to get information about this format from the web site
so I can't tell how much
work this would be or how long it would take me.

There is also a plug in for gbXML that could be used to load geometry into
Sketchup:

Construction practices for each unique location/building combination should
take into account the items Robert mentions presuming appropriate design.
Wind profiles, building pressure control, stack effect, building shape and
so on should all be accounted for in design and then appropriate practices
should be followed.

 

Without appropriate inspections during construction, building leakage
testing, and envelope commissioning 'savings' may be shown in energy
modeling but never achieved in the real world.  My opinion is that this is a
contributor to why energy calculations do not match up to reality now.

 

Thanks,

I agree with Jon's comments about specification of products as being a small
portion of how much infiltration a building will have, not only do
construction practices play a role but also wind profiles on the building,
whether the mechanical systems are controlling building pressure, whether
the building is tall enough to have a stack effect, building shape etc.
Even in performing a winter load calculation and a summer load calculation
we usually change the infiltration rates slightly because average winter
wind speeds are greater than summer wind speeds.

 

If infiltration is going to be accounted for as a savings in energy
modeling, I would think that building leakage testing (similar to duct
leakage testing) and envelope commissioning would need to become more
prominent in our business.  ASHRAE has funded some studies on infiltration
but the data I have seen has been for  residential construction.

In my experience modeling of infiltration has nothing to do with actual
infiltration in a constructed building.  How much infiltration results in an
actual building is 99.9% construction and 0.1% design and specification.  A
well design building to minimize infiltration, with poor attention to
details during construction and sloppy workmanship can end up having more
infiltration than an average design with a good construction team.  

 

I have looked in many plenums only to see daylight and cold-wintery air
flowing into the building, even on LEED projects.

 

These issues make it very difficult to justify infiltration savings in an
energy model.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) did an extensive

They evaluated 116 existing buildings and computer modeled several different

Appendix G says that all components of the building are to be modeled as

Miss Brenda:

 

My suggestion is that LEED immediately start to require a goal for air
leakage and testing of that goal after construction along with requiring
building envelope commissioning.  The current waste of energy and carbon
impact is immense not just in energy operating costs but in dramatically
shortened useful life of building envelope components and entire facades and
roofs.  Most building envelope components reach the end of their useful life
at 40 to 60 percent of the time they should last.  This is one of the
largest contributors to lack of sustainability in the world.  The
significant factors in this are poor/improper installation and lack of
maintenance.  Based upon our rough observations, most NEW buildings are at
double to triple the 'by code' air leakage rate because there is no
inspection, testing, and building envelope commissioning.

 

Those who say the technology does not exist to do the inspecting and testing
are not truthful.  It can be done today.  It is not free but the return is
huge.  Certainly there should be the same requirements in code, but a good
start is you folks, Energy Star and the new ASHRAE rating system.

 

This is an opportunity for USGBC to LEED T, pun intended J, the way. 

 

Wow, that 2 cents felt good.

 

Thanks,

 

Andy

I don't think any of us disagree that there are significant benefits to be
had by having tighter buildings. 

 

Part of the issue is the lack of a documented base line here in the US.  I'm
not aware of any (enforced or otherwise) baseline that is required and/or
published.  Does anyone else have that data?

 

Additionally, projects are not required, at this point in time, to
demonstrate or document air leakage rates after construction.  So that is
typically leaving us with two variables in a model that are based on the
modeler's best judgment.  Understanding many things in the model are the
'modelers best judgment', at this point, we need more to go on.

 

 My unofficial two cents.

 

The good thing about this is there's always room for improvement and there
are a good many, very well intentioned volunteers working on improving the
system.

Dear Paul, et al

 

I have to agree with Paul's comments on this one.

 

We can and have to take account of infiltration reductions within our UK
building regulations calculations and indeed in certain circumstances they
can be the difference between different grades for the buildings when
thermal mass and other passive design techniques or super efficient HVAC
systems have been taken into account.

 

At the design stage you "choose" an infiltration rate that the design team
is willing to take the risk on achieving and if not you can use a default
infiltration rate which equates to a reasonably well built modern building
(this obviously gets reviewed and reduced a little over time to increase the
requirements).  The key to it being that in order for the builder to obtain
the building regulations and occupation certificates, the actual measured
air infiltration rates have to be put into the design simulation model post
build to ensure that what the design team has said will be achieved, is
actually achieved.  In fact it is possibly at the moment one of the most
successful parts of our regulations.

 

This has 2 main benefits, it means that contractors have to think about the
quality of their build and good detailing from the start and subsequently if
they allow a poor building to be built that exceeds the minimum standards or
their chosen design value, they have to go and identify the air leakage
paths and bring the building up to that standard before they can get an
occupation certificate.

 

When you consider that our default air leakage rate is 10m3/hr and we see
many large commercial warehousing projects (a good example where composite
panels are often used for air tight seals) that have leakage rates of less
than 2m3/hr.m2 it is possible to see that large benefits might be possible
in some instances.  On a large warehouse with perhaps background heating for
the operatives, this reduction in infiltration can result in very large
reductions in energy use/carbon emissions for heating, etc.

 

I am slightly surprised that a USGBC/ASHRAE baseline rate doesn't exist to
allow benefits to be taken into account, especially when it is possible to
use the test results to enforce improvements to be made, in a way it acts as
both carrot and stick.

 

Regards

Paul

My understanding is that one of the co-founders of the Air Barrier

an e-mail from him confirming that reduction in air leakage can be modeled
and the energy savings used in the award of LEED points.

 

However, given the contrary position I am hearing, I am beginning to become

reasonable needs to be considered.

I am sure there is just as much baseline for air leakage reduction benefit
as there is for the concrete walls and wooden studs that the User's Manual
says can be modeled and their energy savings captured for inclusion in the
overall modeling results.

 

I cannot accept that the USGBC and ASHRAE can arbitrarily say reduction in
air leakage will not be considered, but that increases in thermal mass
energy-savings from using concrete walls or energy benefits from using
wooden studs will be used to compute building energy performance.  This
obviously rewards concrete block producers and wood stud suppliers and
penalizes air barrier suppliers.  

 

I'm reminded of Lord Acton's famous observation:  "Power corrupts, and
absolute power corrupts absolutely."  Fortunately, even the power of
organizations like ASHRAE and USGBC are subject to some ultimate check.
Such organizations are prohibited by law from arbitrary practices that favor
one group over another.  Below are excerpts from the leading United States
Supreme Court case on the subject. 

 

Paul Grahovac, LEED AP

 

American Society of Mechanical Engineers. Inc. v. Hydrolevel Corporation, 

456 U.S. 556, 102 S.Ct. 1935, 72 L.Ed.2d. 330

(1982), Supreme Court Justice Blackmun, writing for the majority:

 

"Furthermore, a standard setting organization like ASME can be rife with

opportunities for anti competitive activity. Many of ASME's officials are

associated with members of the industries regulated by ASME's codes.

Although, undoubtedly, most serve ASME without concern for the interests of

their corporate employers, some may well view their positions with ASME, at

least in part, as an opportunity to benefit their employers. When the great

influence of ASME's reputation is placed at their disposal, the less
altruistic of

ASME's agents have an opportunity to harm their employers' competitors

through manipulation of ASME's codes."

ID.., at 571, 102 S.Ct., at 1946.

 

In American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed
a jury

verdict that awarded treble damages to the company that was injured by
certain members of the

trade organization that had manipulated the trade organization and its role
in the industry to set

standards designed to enrich those members' corporation and diminish the
ability of its

competitors to fairly compete in the marketplace. In deciding to hold the
trade organization

responsible for the actions of its members, the Court explained:

 

"It is true that imposing liability on ASME's agents themselves will have
some

deterrent effect, because they will know that if they violate antitrust laws
through

their participation in ASME, they risk the consequences of personal civil
liability.

But if, in addition, ASME is civilly liable for the antitrust violations of
its agents

acting with apparent authority, it is much more likely that similar
antitrust

violation will not occur in the future. "Pressure will be brought on the

organization to see to it that its agents abide by the law." United States
v. A&P

Trucking Co., 358 U.S. 121, 126, 79 S.Ct. 203, 207, 3 L.Ed.2d 165 (1958).
Only

ASME can take systematic steps to make improper conduct on the part of all
its

agents unlikely, and the possibility of civil liability will inevitably be a
powerful

incentive for ASME to take those steps. Thus, a rule that imposes liability
on the

standard setting organization- which is best situated to prevent antitrust
violations

through the abuse of its reputation-is most faithful to the congressional
intent that

the private right of action deters antitrust violations."

to provide full balance to their discussions.  That said, you know we
are all working very hard (lots of hard work here) on an enforceable
continuous air barrier addenda.

 

Thanks for all your interest, as always it is a pleasure engage in

Paul,

 

I am a member of the ASHRAE Standard 90.1 Energy Cost Budget Committee
which is responsible for the modeling rules in Appendix G. As far as I
know there have not been any continuous maintenance proposals submitted
to our committee to change the way building leakage is modeled. If there
were such a proposal, the ANSI rules that Standard 90.1 operates under
would require some sort of action (I do not know what the time frame for
that is). There has been a proposal to 90.1 Chapter 5 (Building
Envelope) to require a continuous air barrier which has been out for
several rounds of public review. If that proposal ever gets approved,
Appendix G may need to make changes in the rules for modeling air
infiltration.

 

There is currently nothing in Appendix G that would prohibit someone
from using an exceptional calculation to gain credit for reductions in
building leakage. It would simply be up to the user to demonstrate that
they are doing something in excess of standard practice, and that their
calculations are accurate. Remember that LEED CIR rulings are totally
separate from ASHRAE and under LEED, credit may not be allowed. 

 

On a final note, there is not one member of the ECB subcommittee that
makes his living as a consulting engineer designing HVAC systems, so we
have no financial incentive to ignore a proposal affecting the modeling
of infiltration as you are insinuating in item number 6.

 

Mike

(Return of a Hornet's Nest?)

 

First, I feel that the statement that EAC1 methodology "penalizes air
barrier suppliers" and "rewards concrete block producers" is completely
off-base.  These are not either/or technologies.  There are many other
factors going into the selection of these items besides energy
performance.  If there is real energy and maintenance savings
justification as an investment, then owners will consider it even
without contributing to EAC1.  LEED covers many things, but it isn't an
exhaustive manual of sustainability.  As well, the LEED process,
although growing, still covers only a small fraction of new building
projects, regarding Appendix G applicability.  This is an energy
modeling forum, so let's focus on the Appendix G part of the discussion.

 

Specifically for 90.1 energy performance, it isn't a matter of
arbitrarily accepting one or the other - we as an energy modeling
community have many years of experience and research involved in
accurately modeling the heat transfer in envelope components.  The
capability of various modeling techniques have been demonstrated to be
capable of relatively accurate modeling of the differences between
thermal mass and insulation levels for many years, therefore these
calculations are included in the standard as a path of calculating
energy usage and savings between alternatives.

 

The modeling software are generally able to predict what would happen
due to a given change in level of infiltration.  The modeling
improvements need to be made in the area of showing that the
calculations are accurate in determining those levels, rather than using
a specified reduction.  Does the software available have the needed
parameters to model a product such as yours?  On a case-by-case basis
you may be able to show that you know all of the needed parameters to
make these calculations.  I'm not sure if you could apply these to all
projects, and all software packages though.  For instance, do you feel
that your product has different effectiveness than other brands?  How
would someone capture these differences in efficiency in eQuest or
EnergyPlus?  Would it be okay with the USGBC to propose a straight
percentage reduction?  What's the starting point for the base case?  How
much variability is there in the construction process?

 

Your input would be welcomed if you offer some expertise in these areas.

 

You mention a study that shows benefits in many cases for 116 buildings
(and common sense would agree with this).  Some focus should be on
educating designers to use the strategy and contractors on proper
installation, regardless of the "points" that are achieved, and under
what conditions the strategy would be most effective.

 

Just my $0.02.

I am sure there is just as much baseline for air leakage reduction
benefit as there is for the concrete walls and wooden studs that the
User's Manual says can be modeled and their energy savings captured for
inclusion in the overall modeling results.

 

I cannot accept that the USGBC and ASHRAE can arbitrarily say reduction
in air leakage will not be considered, but that increases in thermal
mass energy-savings from using concrete walls or energy benefits from
using wooden studs will be used to compute building energy performance.
This obviously rewards concrete block producers and wood stud suppliers
and penalizes air barrier suppliers.  

 

I'm reminded of Lord Acton's famous observation:  "Power corrupts, and
absolute power corrupts absolutely."  Fortunately, even the power of
organizations like ASHRAE and USGBC are subject to some ultimate check.
Such organizations are prohibited by law from arbitrary practices that
favor one group over another.  Below are excerpts from the leading
United States Supreme Court case on the subject. 

 

Paul Grahovac, LEED AP

 

American Society of Mechanical Engineers. Inc. v. Hydrolevel
Corporation, 

456 U.S. 556, 102 S.Ct. 1935, 72 L.Ed.2d. 330

(1982), Supreme Court Justice Blackmun, writing for the majority:

 

"Furthermore, a standard setting organization like ASME can be rife with

opportunities for anti competitive activity. Many of ASME's officials
are

associated with members of the industries regulated by ASME's codes.

Although, undoubtedly, most serve ASME without concern for the interests
of

their corporate employers, some may well view their positions with ASME,
at

least in part, as an opportunity to benefit their employers. When the
great

influence of ASME's reputation is placed at their disposal, the less
altruistic of

ASME's agents have an opportunity to harm their employers' competitors

through manipulation of ASME's codes."

ID.., at 571, 102 S.Ct., at 1946.

 

In American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the U.S. Supreme Court
affirmed a jury

verdict that awarded treble damages to the company that was injured by
certain members of the

trade organization that had manipulated the trade organization and its
role in the industry to set

standards designed to enrich those members' corporation and diminish the
ability of its

competitors to fairly compete in the marketplace. In deciding to hold
the trade organization

responsible for the actions of its members, the Court explained:

 

"It is true that imposing liability on ASME's agents themselves will
have some

deterrent effect, because they will know that if they violate antitrust
laws through

their participation in ASME, they risk the consequences of personal
civil liability.

But if, in addition, ASME is civilly liable for the antitrust violations
of its agents

acting with apparent authority, it is much more likely that similar
antitrust

violation will not occur in the future. "Pressure will be brought on the

organization to see to it that its agents abide by the law." United
States v. A&P

Trucking Co., 358 U.S. 121, 126, 79 S.Ct. 203, 207, 3 L.Ed.2d 165
(1958). Only

ASME can take systematic steps to make improper conduct on the part of
all its

agents unlikely, and the possibility of civil liability will inevitably
be a powerful

incentive for ASME to take those steps. Thus, a rule that imposes
liability on the

standard setting organization- which is best situated to prevent
antitrust violations

through the abuse of its reputation-is most faithful to the
congressional intent that

the private right of action deters antitrust violations."

14:., at 572-573, 102 S.Ct., at 1946.

As I understand it the issue is that the 90.1 Standard does not
establish a base line condition for air leakage so no savings can be
claimed.  I certainly agree that the savings are real and should be
counted.  I know that the Appendix G committee has this issue on their

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Air leakage, LEED, and Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1

 

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) did an
extensive study documenting a greater than 40% natural gas savings and a
greater than 25% electricity savings across the nation for building
energy consumption if buildings were uniformly constructed with air
barrier systems installed.  They evaluated 116 existing buildings and
computer modeled several different building types.  The purpose of their
study was to provide information to ASHRAE concerning whether it would
be desirable to add an air barrier requirement to ASHRAE 90.1.

 

As a result, I've always thought that Appendix G to ASHRAE 90.1 allows
you to change the air leakage rate off the default and onto a rate
corresponding to an air barrier installation, so that you could claim
LEED points for the corresponding energy savings.  However, an architect
at a presentation I did said you could not do that under the LEED and
ASHRAE requirements.  (I know the models will do it, because I've done
it on the TRANE model and obtained results that support the NIST
findings.)

 

I see in Appendix G that:  "G3.1.2.5. Ventilation.  Minimum outdoor air
ventilation rates shall be the same for the proposed and baseline
building designs."  However, I searched the document for "outdoor air
ventilation" and the phrase occurs only in the context of mechanical
systems that are designed to intentionally bring air into the building.
If this section is the basis for concluding that air leakage barriers
should be left out of the modeling, then I have trouble understanding
why.

 

Appendix G says that all components of the building are to be modeled as
designed.  That would preclude modeling as if an air barrier system did
not exist in the design.  It says the baseline building model is to have
steel-framed above-grade walls, and it is silent about the design
building, but the User's Manual says that if the design building walls
are block or cast concrete, then "the mass is credited in the building
performance rating method."  Likewise, if the walls are wood stud
instead of steel, then the Manual says credit is given for the superior
energy performance of wood frame versus steel frame.  The User's Manual
states that it:  "Offers information on the intent and application of
Standard 90.1."  Given these examples in the Manual based on existing
thermal mass energy-saving data and wood-versus-steel stud energy data,
it is difficult to conclude that a wall that is constructed with
materials meeting the air leakage limits and installation requirements
of the Air Barrier Association of America and determined to produce
significant energy savings by the NIST study based on those same limits
and requirements should be modeled as if it leaked air like a building
without an air barrier. 

 

Please let me know what you think, and if you know of any reason why it
is not proper to change the air leakage rate through the building
envelope in the design model to show the benefit of air barriers.

I take it one step further than Leonard with LEED and think ASHRAE should be
active.

 

You should not be able to get any LEED certification without meeting a
minimum provable level of air/vapor/moisture tightness and every building
should be required to undergo whole building commissioning with appropriate
testing to prove it.

 

Regarding ASHRAE, it should be a requirement that whole building
commissioning of air/vapor/moisture tightness occurs with submitted results
so that the requirement ends up in code.  Not only will this provide the
mechanism to show if buildings are meeting code requirements for
infiltration (the vast majority exceed the accepted/mandated standard) but
also will let owners compare and see how effective, therefore money saving
and what human comfort level, their structures provide compared to others.
It would be wise for ASHRAE to include provable inspection requirements so
that issues are identified as work occurs and dealt with, the whole building
commissioning/testing will only tell that you do or do not have a problem
and sometimes where the problem might be/is but not always.  

 

Lots of assemblies and components are very specified but little
inspection/testing of them once built is required let alone the entire
building envelope, which is what really counts.  So we know the assembly is
good IF it is built properly and the building envelope is good IF every
assembly is built properly and IF every assembly is integrated properly into
the whole but we do not have any requirement to show/prove it such as
inspect, commission, and/or test/measure - crazy in my opinion.

Message-ID: <c53178e80908271958r241c3fb3gc3ded623a7881d8c@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I am trying to model several types of Low E glazing in Design Builder to
understand the effect on the peak heating and cooling load.

While choosing different glazing, I could not understand which surface of
the glazing has the Low E coating.

I would appreciate any inputs about this aspect.

The "surface" depends on the climate.

Cooling dominated climates benefit from the low-E on the inside surface of the outside pane.

Heating dominated climates benefit from the low-E on the outside surface of the inside pane.

Such characteristics are normally defined by the applicable codes for a given location.

Jeff,

Thank you for responding. I agree that it depends on the climate.

Design Builder has the option called 'flip' while making the double pane
assembly. Hence I was not clear as to which surface is the coating on and
what does flip actually mean?

Hi Deepa
I think flip means swap the place of inside and outside pane - not  
flipping the individual panes so that the coating moves to the  
opposite surface.
DB uses the International Glazing Database which you can download from  
lbnl. It's easy to use so worth downloading a copy. Unforunately you  
can't transfer the results to DB at present.

Hi Deepa,

I believe 'flip' means to switch which 'surface' on the individual pane the low-E coating is applied to. The order of the panes in the glazing setup will not change if you tick the flip box. When you are building up a glazing system, design builder clearly shows 'outermost pane' and 'innermost pane', these do not change if you check the flip box.

Basically I believe it is the opposite to what Chris just said.

In terms of finding out on which surface the coating originally is, and thus where it will move to if 'flipped', I have found using the software Window5 easiest for this. In Window5, find the same pane you wish to use in DesignBuilder and when you look at the glazing set up you can see a dashed line which indicates the location of the coating. 

Hope that helps

Nick's right. I didn't have the software in front of me at the time.  
Window 5 uses the international glazing database that I talked about.  
DB uses the same data. It is easier to review it in Window. I don't  
think Window has a flip feature - is that right Nick?
Cheers
Chris

WINDOW has function to flip glass.  It is a check box "flip" at the 
glazing layer level.  Same function is available in DesignBuilder.

DesignBuilder includes IGDB and the rule is the same as in WINDOW, 
surface 1 is facing outdoor, while surface 2 is facing indoors.  Same 
rule applies to layers, first glass is outdoormost, last glass is 
innermost.  In DesignBuiolder you can look at the emissivities of each 
glass layer and if emissivity is lower than 0.84 (usually low-e is is 
less that about 0.2), then this is low-e surface.  So if the glass that 
you selected has low-e surface facing wrong side, then you can check 
"flip" box and reverse it.  As somebody pointed out, this reverses the 
orientation of the glass, not the order of glass in the glazing system.  
Typically, you want to have one low-e surface in each gap space (having 
two low-e surfaces in the same gap space provides negligible 
improvement) and typically you do not want low-e facing either indoor or 
outdoor (some manufacturers have started using hard coat low-e facing 
indoors in order to improve U-factor of the glazing system and whole 
window, but this is still pretty rare due to issues of cleaning exposed 
low-e surfaces, discoloring, etc.  Also, it has negative consequences on 
condensation resistance.)  Thus if you have, for example double glazing 
system with Pilkington Suncool  Brilliant 30/17 (low-e glass) on the 
outdoor side and Pilkington North America Optifloat  Clear (Clear) on 
the indoor side, you will notice that the low-e surface on the 
Pilkington Suncool  Brilliant 30/17 is surface #1, which would mean that 
it faces outdoors.  So you would check flip box, which will place low-e 
coating on surface #2, which would be correct becasue it would be facing 
the glazing gap.

Charlie,

Where can you find the emmisivity of each glass in Design Builder? I am
looking for the same.

Nick, I agree with your comments about the 'flip' function in Design
Builder. Is there a way to find out which surface has the coating in Design
Builder ?

I have not yet used Windows5.


Thanks,
Deepa

Deepa,

When you go to Openings in DB, and select glazing, then either edit 
existing or create new ("+") glazing system, in the screen that opens, 
on the left part of that screen there is section with Layers, and when 
you click on Pane Type, on the right side of the screen, there is upper 
portion and lower portion.  Upper portion is selection area and there is 
selection of glasses, including IGDB.  They are grouped by types (clear, 
coated, etc.).  If you expand coated group and select one of coated 
glazings, lower portion (right below the list) shows properties.  If you 
scroll down, you will see section on Infra-Red properties, where 
emissivities 1 and 2 are listed.  first one is outdoor faced and second 
one is indoor faced, so as appropriate you can determine if it is right 
orientation or not, and if not you just use flip box in the left portion 
of the screen where you clicked on Pane Type.

Charlie

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Actual Thermal Efficiency of Boilers
Message-ID: <FFF56A6D37A3A54F91A03601AC22DA3205E3C142BB@MAILBOX2.nrel.gov>

ASHRAE 90.1 mandates that a Gas-Fired Boiler ? 300,000 Btu/hr & ? 2,500,000 Btu/hr must have a minimum 75% Thermal Efficiency (Et) based upon the Test Proceedure Hydronics Institute Boiler Standard.

The Hydronics Institute Boiler Standard official title is "BTS-2000 Testing Standard : Method to Determine Efficiency of Commercial Space Heating Boilers" published by The Hydronics Institute Division of Air-Conditioning, Heating, Refrigeration Institute (AHRI).  Can be found at : http://www.ahrinet.org/ARI/util/showdoc.aspx?doc=1198.

The Testing Standard measures the Thermal Efficiency of the Boiler at steady state operation, fully loaded maintaining the outlet temperature at 180?F.  Oddly, the inlet water temperature into the Boiler is between 35?F to 80?F which is much lower than the typical Return Water Temperature of 150?F in a Building Application.  Consequently, these colder inlet temperatures are most likely overstating the Thermal Efficiency of the Boiler which is condensing even if the Boiler is a Non-Condensing Boiler.  Based on various Manufacturer's data, a Boiler operating with an 80?F Return Water Temperature achieves a 10% greater Thermal Efficiency compared with operating at a standard 150?F Return Water Temperature.  Then operating at a 35?F Return Water Temperature, the Thermal Efficiency should be boosted even further.

Would it be reasonable to assume that a Standard Atmospheric Boiler that meets the 75% Tc minimum based on ASHRAE 90.1 according to the BTS-2000 Testing Standard using 80?F Return Water Temperature would actually operate at 65% Tc in the field operating at 150?F Return Water Temperature?

	unconditioned buildings?

Hello All,

I have some questions regarding applicability of ASHRAE 90.1 2004 and LEED
2.2 for unconditioned buildings:

1. Is ASHRAE 90.1 2004 applicable to unconditioned buildings?

2. How does an unconditioned building meet the EA Pr.2 - Minimum Energy
Performance of LEED 2.2?

I found this CIR:

12/3/2003 -  Credit Interpretation Request
In our campus project, one of the three LEED registered buildings is
unconditioned. The ASHRAE Standard 90.1 indicates that there are no
requirements for unconditioned spaces, making the Energy Cost Budget Method
not applicable. Are unconditioned spaces exempt from the Minimum Energy
Performance EA Prerequisite 2 and the Optimize Energy Performance Credit
calculations? If not what methodology is used?


12/22/2003 -  Ruling
If the unconditioned building meets the ASHRAE 90.1-99 definition of
unconditioned space (i.e. is not a parking garage and has been approved by
the building department), then the building meets the LEED EA Prerequisite
2. The unconditioned building cannot qualify for any points under the
Optimize Energy Performance Credit because there are no possible energy
savings. If this building is a parking garage, then it must treated
according to the ASHRAE 90.1-99 requirements for parking garages.

3. Is this CIR applicable to LEED 2.2 and ASHRAE 90.1 2004? Does this CIR
means that unconditioned buildings have no requirements on lighting, motors,
service water heating etc?

4. How does an unconditioned building get points in EA Cr. 1 - Optimize
Energy Performance?

5. How is a project declared conditioned/unconditioned? If there is a
buildings with 500,000 sft area and say 1000 sft is conditioned and
remaining is unconditioned, will the building be assumed to be
unconditioned. I am told that if the conditioned area is less than 5% of the
total area then the building can be considered unconditioned and ASHARE need
not be applied, not even to the ACs in the conditioned areas!

Kindly let me know your thoughts on these questions. Any CIR or precedence
will help.

Thanks and regards,

Vishal Garg

Dear Ian,

1.	Without looking at the BTS Standard, I suspect the 35 - 80F you
mention below is the delta T between inlet and outlet water.  It would be
ridiculous to test a boiler with 35F inlet water.
2.	A bigger issue, if you are interested in predicting actual operating
efficiency is the "cycling efficiency" of the boiler.  In short, an
accurately sized boiler benefits greatly from a) a high turndown in firing
rate or b) a buffer / storage tank that allows it to operate for long
periods even at low load.  
As far as I know, most larger, high water volume boilers perform reasonably
close to the nameplate efficiency when equipped with good turndown (4:1 or
better). 
Smaller, low water volume boilers (the atmospheric type you are thinking
about) that cycle Off - High or Off-Low-High probably need a buffer tank or
they'll operate at much lower than nameplate efficiency during the non-peak
periods (i.e., 95% of the heating season)
3.	A compounding factor is that all of us engineers routinely oversize
boilers "just to make sure" nobody complains.  This oversizing can be 20-50%
and exacerbates the turndown issue.

Hoping that's helpful.....

operating at a standard 150?F Return Water Temperature.  Then operating at a
35?F Return Water Temperature, the Thermal Efficiency should be boosted even
further.  

 

Would it be reasonable to assume that a Standard Atmospheric Boiler that
meets the 75% Tc minimum based on ASHRAE 90.1 according to the BTS-2000
Testing Standard using 80?F Return Water Temperature would actually operate
at 65% Tc in the field operating at 150?F Return Water Temperature?

Thanks for you response.  Concerning your first question, take a quick look at the standard http://www.ahrinet.org/ARI/util/showdoc.aspx?doc=1198 and you'll see that entering water temperature is required to be between 35?F - 80?F.  This is not the delta-T.  It doesn't make any sense and I'm wondering why the standard was written this way.

Hello,

Sometimes, when modelling HVAC systems, its very difficult to find performance curves of boilers, chillers, split and VRV machines, since the energy plus data sets may not have it. Sometimes the manufacturer technical data does not have it also.  Does anyone know any other sources of this information?

Dear Ian,

I (finally) took a look at the Standard.  You're right and, as a result, I
think you are also correct that it's inappropriate to assume that efficiency
is as high as the nameplate when your site's entering water temp is higher
than 80F.  By the way, I suspect that water as cold as 35F is part of the
entering water temp range for applications like water or ground source heat
pumps.  In those cases, a boiler may be used to boost the water temp.

Your question, and this standard, highlight the importance of understanding
what you are modeling.  Good results cannot be obtained with faulty input!

Ian,

 

Thanks for the link. 

 

A boiler with no return water / condensate return is the only boiler I can
think of that would operate with 100% make-up water, thus seeing the
incoming water temperatures you cite. In practice I have encountered this
with process steam boilers with no condensate return (incoming temp =
groundwater temp of 50 or 55 F), or pool water heaters that directly heat
the pool water (with incoming water temperatures of 70 F - 80 F), but never
with a commercial space heating boiler. 

 

I have been provided similar misleading high efficiency data from a steam
boiler manufacturer claiming their boiler was as high as 90 % efficient, but
this was only with very cold entering water temperatures.

 

For a new atmospheric boiler I suspect the seasonal efficiency is much
closer to 75% than 65% even with 150 F return water temperatures. I have
seen steady-state combustion efficiency tests of 78% to 80% for these style
boilers, and that is with return water temperatures of 150 F or higher.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Actual Thermal Efficiency of Boilers

 

ASHRAE 90.1 mandates that a Gas-Fired Boiler ? 300,000 Btu/hr & ? 2,500,000
Btu/hr must have a minimum 75% Thermal Efficiency (Et) based upon the Test
Proceedure Hydronics Institute Boiler Standard.  

 

The Hydronics Institute Boiler Standard official title is "BTS-2000 Testing
Standard : Method to Determine Efficiency of Commercial Space Heating
Boilers" published by The Hydronics Institute Division of Air-Conditioning,
Heating, Refrigeration Institute (AHRI).  Can be found at :
http://www.ahrinet.org/ARI/util/showdoc.aspx?doc=1198.   

 

The Testing Standard measures the Thermal Efficiency of the Boiler at steady
state operation, fully loaded maintaining the outlet temperature at 180?F.
Oddly, the inlet water temperature into the Boiler is between 35?F to 80?F
which is much lower than the typical Return Water Temperature of 150?F in a
Building Application.  Consequently, these colder inlet temperatures are
most likely overstating the Thermal Efficiency of the Boiler which is
condensing even if the Boiler is a Non-Condensing Boiler.  Based on various
Manufacturer's data, a Boiler operating with an 80?F Return Water
Temperature achieves a 10% greater Thermal Efficiency compared with
operating at a standard 150?F Return Water Temperature.  Then operating at a
35?F Return Water Temperature, the Thermal Efficiency should be boosted even
further.  

 

Would it be reasonable to assume that a Standard Atmospheric Boiler that
meets the 75% Tc minimum based on ASHRAE 90.1 according to the BTS-2000
Testing Standard using 80?F Return Water Temperature would actually operate
at 65% Tc in the field operating at 150?F Return Water Temperature?

I am trying to simulate the geotermal plant with TRNSys for a study for my

You might want to check out "ecalc.tamu.edu...go to the 'legacy" calculator", a web-based NOx, SOx and CO2 emissions calculator for Texas developed by our Laboratory for the USEPA several years back. This performs real simulations, checks them against code-compliant buildings and emails your NOx, SOx and CO2 savings to you. It also will calculate pollution savings from the installation of solar thermal, solar PV, wind and municipal retrofits. It uses eGRID values for Texas for 1999 and 2007. Soon to be updated to 2013.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] FW: SOLAR 2010 Call for Participation - please forward
Message-ID: <55BA83825A482144A8637F9CAA981F7614812C55@las-mail.lordaecksargent.internal>

Excuse the cross posting. The call for abstracts for Solar 2010 is out.
For those of you who have never been, it's a really high quality solar
energy conference hosted by the American Solar Energy Society. Ed
Mazria, Baruch Givoni and other building science legends are normally
regulars at the conference, so it's a pretty exciting learning
opportunity. The conference typically has a very strong building science
track, with technical papers on various topics ranging from natural
ventilation & daylighting to hybrid ventilation systems and passive
solar simulation techniques. 

 

Abstracts are due Nov 9th 2009.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Unable to satisfy heating coil load
Message-ID: <DD19914D43E24645BD20A03688463AEF0698863D@ex-be01.burohappold.com>

Hello             

 

I have been working on a GSHP model in a northeast climate that is sized
for cooling and has an auxiliary boiler system to handle remaining
heating load for the building. The main air system is VAV Fan Powered
Boxes, but the errors are occurring only on the systems that happen to
be constant volume. For whatever reason I am getting a bunch of warnings
about the heating coils not having sufficient capacity, or rather the
system does not have sufficient capacity to handle the heating loads. I
have left everything auto-sized and used the appropriate equipment
controls to have the boiler pick up the remaining load but there must be
an error in my methods. I am getting capacity out of the boiler in the
hourly reports so it makes me think that my problems are related to the
air side system sizing or controls, but to be honest I am not sure here
is the Warning:

 

             PREHEAT/HEATING-CAPACITY in SYSTEM Process AHU Lower


             is too low to provide the requested supply temperature for

             the calculated mixed air temperature using total ZONE loads

             (on LS-A/B) and SYSTEM design parameters, plus outside air

             conditions (on LS-C), and specified capacities & air flows.

             Requested temperature is  55.00 calculated is   3.24

             Check HEATING-CAPACITY, HEAT-SET-T, PRE-HEAT-T,
MAX-SUPPLY-T,

             DESIGN-HEAT-T, and ZONE loads for consistency.
