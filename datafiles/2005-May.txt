Dear all,

I am working on a simulation of structure with a dynamic double envelope external wall. This external wall allows outside air to remove heat from the within the double envelope and depending on the inside/ outside conditions rejects it outside or supplies inside. 

Does anyone have any ideas for how to simulate this. Can I use it as a sun-space or separate thermal zones for each side(8" wide)? I am using EnergyPlus but am open to other tools if any help.

Thanks
Amit

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200505311743.AA4337406pd80000687353@gard.com>

I followed the method suggested earlier to model the heat recovery system (Renee's email). I set the ERV type to 'enthalpy wheel', with the make up air temp ctrl set to mixed air reset & capacity control to ' trim economizer's (the design engineer suggested this was the closest to the designed system). 
 
The overall savings shown were minute, with a penalty shown on the electric side in fans (this I had foreseen from additional static pressure needed to drive the air through the enthalpy wheel) & space cooling (this was surprising - especially since the base system had humidity controlled at 50%). The space heating was the only thing which showed considerable savings.
 
Am I missing something, or does this mean that the system (a Semco ERV unit) is probably not great for this climate (Asheville, NC). 
 
I would appreciate any insight into this
 
Thanks

Short answer: I don't think so, and I wish it had been adopted under 2.1.

As with most things, a CIR would be required to be sure.  I have looked
briefly at trying to use portions of the Appendix G protocol for modeling
buildings under 2.1, but gave up on it as uncertain and not worth the CIR
effort (the buildings I work on can typically model out at 50-60% without
it).  I would love to hear that I am wrong - anyone with good news for me?
LEED 2.2 jumps to ASHRAE 90.1-2004 and calls out Appendix G by name
(hallelujah - low pressure drop system fan savings will finally count!).
Speaking with zero insider knowledge, I have the impression that the
USGBC's main attitude towards Addendum E is that they've accepted it in
2.2 (which required a major shifting of the point versus savings scale)
and will deal with specific modeling questions on a case by case CIR basis
under 2.1.  Your mileage may vary.

Good luck,

John Weale

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] roof anchors and condensation
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200505271650.AA5050906pd80000684224@gard.com>

Hi,

 

This isn't quite a modeling question, but I figured you all might have some
insight.

 

I am working on a new refrigerated warehouse that is under construction in
New Hampshire.  

The roof assembly is basically a metal corrugated deck, on top of which is
R-50 of rigid foam insulation.  The underside of the deck is exposed to the
refrigerated area.  Roof anchors tie the rigid insulation to the roof deck /
joists.  The rubber membrane roof is adhered to the top of the foam
insulation.  

 

The owner asked whether it made sense to install an additional layer of
rigid insulation above the standard layers.  The new layer would raise the
total assembly to R-63, and would be glued to the top side of the standard
insulation, so that the roof anchors would be embedded in an insulation
sandwich.  We calculated minimal refrigeration savings from the added
R-value.  However, the owner felt that sandwiching the metal anchors in
insulation would remove any threat of condensation and freezing below the
roof membrane where the anchors would potentially be cold enough to cause
this.

 

The owner said that on another building, the roof membrane became separated
at the location of the anchors, and they attributed it to the cold spots,
condensation, and freezing caused by the anchors and their conduit into the
cold space.    Has anyone heard of such a problem?  At first glance, it
would seem that on a hot day, the top end of the metal anchor would be
sufficiently warmed by the hot roof so as not to cause any condensation or
freezing at the membrane surface.  In the winter, the whole roof will be
below freezing, so the extra insulation won't affect things relative to the
anchor then.  Is there another explanation for the failed roofing that the
owner described?  Perhaps the penetration of the anchors through the
insulation is allowing moisture from the space to migrate up to the roof
membrane, and the moisture is trapped and then freezes in the winter?  

 

Any ideas appreciated, as always.  Happy Memorial Day.

 

 

Sincerely,

Alec Stevens, PE, LEED AP

 The tests cited below were for BALES, not bale wall construction.  The
most reliable tests on bale wall construction was done at ORNL circa
1997.  It was written up in a report to the California Energy Commission
and in a paper delivered at the 1998 ACEEE Summer Study on Buildings.
Authors: Nehemiah Stone and Tav Commins.
The R-value is about R-33.  The thermal lag is about 12-15 hours for a
standard (22") bale wall.
Hope this helps.

Nesen,
Here is a link to some master's thesis work that found an insulation
value for wheat straw as high as R-52 (hr-sqft-F/BTU) for a 16.5 in
thick bale, (R-3.15/in).  However, the R value was found to decrease
with increasing delta T and also depends on straw direction relative to
the temperature gradient.  As far as I can tell, the dependence of R
value on moisture content was not tested.
 The bales used had about 8.2-8.4% moisture content and an average
density of
8.33 lbs/cuft(wheat) to 7.72 lbs/cuft(rice).  However, the moisture
content of installed walls will vary depending on climate and season and
the density will depend on how the straw was baled and whether the walls
are load bearing or not.
 Usually, straw bales are covered with stucco, so this should determine
the absorptive and emissive properties of the wall construction.  I hope
this helps.

In DOE-2 you could make a dummy zone that has a 100% AHU that apx. the outside air unit and lump the answer with the main unit w/o outside air. 

However, a better approach would be the dual path system that Prof. Brandemuehl at CU developed for EPRI using the HVAC02 toolkit, which would then need to be attached to your loads simulation.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200505261036.AA3636234pd80000682566@gard.com>

Nesen,
 
The only data on strawbale homes I know of is the work done by Oak Ridge
National Lab.  Their most recent hotbox test of a 19" strawbale wall
found it to have an R-value of 27.5.  You can find the test results in
the Advanced Wall Systems database at :
http://www.ornl.gov/sci/roofs+walls/AWT/Ref/TechHome.htm
 
Good luck,
 
Mike

Dear All,
 
I am working on a project for thermal performance analysis of a
strawbale house with ECOTECT in Faculty of Architecture, Middle East
Technical University. The study is a part of a research project for
building an eco-center working on several types pf construction
techniques with local and prefabricated elements. Unfortunately the
programe does not have the material properties ofr strawbale in its
material library. I would be glad for any help regarding to thermal
properties of strawbale including u-value, admittance, solar absorption,
thermal degreement, and thermal lag. Any comments or advices for helpful
resources would be welcome...
 
Thanks in advance

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200505231419.AA1956265pd80000679444@gard.com>

Hello:

Here's a stab at your question since it seems like nobody has answered this.

DOE-2.1e uses a family of curve fits to "simulate" a chiller, heat pump, boiler, fan, etc. You can read about this in p. IV.14 of the DOE2.1a Reference manual. You will also need to read about Equipment Quadratics on page V.37 of the same manual. These curve fits are default or user defined linear, bi-linear, quadratic, bi-quadratic or cubic curves that are listed in the output page PV-G of the Plant program, when specified. 

To see what your model is using, you'll need to run your building, determine which quadratics you are using for your "heat pump", and then look at the quadratics using the PV-G command for your building, perhaps plot these in a spreadsheet and compare against ARI specs.

The EPA ENERGY STAR Label for Buildings, of which the Target Finder Mr. Liu
noted is a tool, will serve you well for offices.  I believe it uses 1999
CBECS survey data.  In my recent experience what the Target Finder calls
"average" is a bit low -- twelve of the thirteen buildings I most recently
benchmarked were above average (and I haven't been doing my work in Lake
Wobegon).  Since the tool normalizes for weather, occupancy, and function
within building, among other things, I suspect that recent growth in server
room power intensity could be an explanation.  Others are welcome to
challenge me on this.

ORNL also has an office benchmarking site,
http://eber.ed.ornl.gov/benchmark/tools.htm, as does yet another LBL site,
http://poet.lbl.gov/arch/.  BOMA sells such data privately.

Depending what type of laboratories are of interest to you, try the LBL
Cleanrooms Web site, http://ateam.lbl.gov/cleanroom/, and the LBL 21st
Century Labs, Web site,
http://www.labs21century.gov/toolkit/benchmarking.htm, may be of use.

Finally you asked about pharmaceutical manufacturing.  The DOE Plant Energy
Profiler is a powerful tool for the Chemical industry benchmarking of which
Pharm is a subsection as classified by SIC.

Alec:

Energy Star has a on-line program called Target Finder, which is based on
energy performance data of commercial buildings. using this program, you can
find utility consumption for various buildings. It may be useful for you.

Following is the URL of Target Finder and a brief introduction of how the
performance data are obtained.
http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=target_finder.bus_target_finder

"The Energy Use Intensity generated by Target Finder reflects the
distribution of energy performance in commercial buildings derived from data
in the Energy Information Agency's (US Department of Energy) Commercial
Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS)1. The required data inputs were
found to be the primary drivers of energy use. The zip code is used to
determine the weather conditions that the building would experience in a
normal year (based on a 30-year climate average). The total annual energy
use intensity for the target is based on the energy sources typical in the
region specified by the zip code. For example, an Office Building in the
20902 zip code would be roughly 80/20%, electricity to natural gas. Users
may enter their own fuel mix."

Hi, Alec:
 
There are some national U.S. data compiled for energy use intensity (EUI)
index, reported in kWh/sf-yr or kBtu/sf-yr, which you can obtain from DOE
and Pacifica Gas and Electric. Here are some URLs:

 <http://buildingsdatabook.eere.energy.gov>  
Also, there is a great interactive database tool (CEBCS 98) from the Pacific
Northwest National Laboratory that has compiled EUI information in a
database. What's great about this tool is that you can install search and
sort by building type, energy end use, vintage, geographic region and other
variables. The information is dated (pre-1995) but it might be helpful just
the same. Contact David Eike at david.eike at pnl.gov

Dear All, 
 

I am writing in order to apply for an internship position (six-month) at some building simulation company, beginning in July or August 2005.

 

I am currently at the fourth year of my Civil Engineering undergraduate studies at the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC), Brazil, and this is my last semester of classes.

 

In the last two years I've been working with building simulation research using EnergyPlus software,  at UFSC/LabEEE, supervised by Roberto Lamberts. I have interests on sustainable building design supported by simulation tools. I have skills in EnergyPlus, Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, Access), Microsoft Project, AutoCAD, VisualBASIC, Pascal and good knowledge in hardware maintenance. I am native portuguese speaker and fluent in English language.




Do not hesitate in requesting any information that might be necessary. Would be grateful for a return of some company.

To set up a building model in EnergyPlus without using a third party tool 
requires entering 3-D coodinates for surfaces using a text editor or the IDF 
Editor (a utility which simplifies punctuation and formatting but still 
requires the same data entry).

Yes.  The COMIS multizone airflow model is integrated in EnergyPlus.  Depending 
on the application, the data requirements can be signficant to describe all of 
the pertinent openings for airflow.

Dear All,
 

I am writing in order to apply for an internship position (six-month) at some building simulation company, beginning in July or August 2005.

 

I am currently at the fourth year of my Civil Engineering undergraduate studies at the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC), Brazil, and this is my last semester of classes.

 

In the last two years I've been working with building simulation research using EnergyPlus software,  at UFSC/LabEEE, supervised by Roberto Lamberts. I have interests on sustainable building design supported by simulation tools. I have skills in EnergyPlus, Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, Access), Microsoft Project, AutoCAD, VisualBASIC, Pascal and good knowledge in hardware maintenance. I am native portuguese speaker and fluent in English language.




Do not hesitate in requesting any information that might be necessary. Would be grateful for a return of some company.

samuel at labeee.ufsc.br 


Florian?polis, Brazil, May 20.



Regards

Samuel Gosch

Hi all.

I?m searching for the eQuest model's mathematical
ecquations implemented for the chiller type HEAT PUMP.
My plant equipment is an air cooled, two mode unit,
both cooling and heating, that supply conditioned
water to a two-pipe loop.

I can?t find the mathematical model in DOE2.2
documentation, nor in DOE2.1A engineer manual.

Could you help me to find this information about the
model?

Thanks,

Dear Pat and Colleagues,
All of us at GeoPraxis are shocked and profoundly saddened to hear of Jeff's
tragic accident and to realize that our entire community must now suffer the
untimely loss of one of our most accomplished and inspirational leaders. I
personally will never forget a speech Jeff gave circa 1996 (Vancouver?) that
rose well above the usual technical minutiae of our meeting to challenge all
of us to take the chances and really live up to the task of becoming the
heroes the planet so desperately needs us to be. Coming from almost anyone
else this could easily have come across sounding preachy and self-important,
but with Jeff's characteristic cool logic and charismatic surferdude charm
it was simply a matter of fact... and the room thanked him for being so bold
as to stand up and say it. Needless to say, his words and the example he set
remain an inspiration to us all to this day.

We will all sorely miss him... and maybe if we're righteous and lucky
enough, we too will get to go in the woods doing something we love.

Surf's up Jeff, peace be with you

  For those who may not know, or remember Jeff, his work at NBI is, and will

  He fell off a cliff after crashing his mountain bike. As Pat said - he

Dear All,
 
I am a beginner in EnergyPlus. I have several questions below. I hope some helps from you experts. Thank you. 
 
Can EnergyPlus set up the building model directly or a thirty party support tool has to be used? I know that now there is a converter called IFCtoIDF, which is a utility for importing building geometry from commercial CAD tools into EnergyPlus. However, it is easier to setup the model in EnergyPlus directly. 

 

Another question is that can EnergyPlus do naturally ventilated building without HVAC system? 

 

Thank you very much

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200505171606.AA0614453pd80000673020@gard.com>

Hi,

I am trying to use eQuest to model heat recovery chillers with
waterside economisers.  The heat recovery chillers will also act as the
primary heat source with steam as a backup.  

So, at each hour the heat recovery chillers will run to meet the larger
of either the heating or cooling loads.  When heat off the chiller is
not needed to meet heating loads, it will be rejected to a lake.  When
the lake water is cool enough, it will be used directly (through a heat
exchanger) to provide cooling.  

Essentially, my central plant is a heat pump.  Can this be modelled in
eQuest?

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Catherine

E-10 V1.6 does not model night insulation for windows or Trombe wall
derived elements.
This feature has been promised for  E-10 V2.0 which is due out soon.....
Take 24 hr average insulation value for windows on a 12 hr / 12 hr basis
for annual runs,
then go back and run Dec-Jan only with 9 hrs daylight 15 hrs night for
avg. window insulation.

Three loops of PEX tubing set in the slab, in the middle of the rock
storage, and at the bottom of the rock storage
will beat active air recirculation.

E-10 V1.6 does not model night insulation for windows or Trombe wall 
derived elements.
This feature has been promised for  E-10 V2.0 which is due out soon.....
Take 24 hr average insulation value for windows on a 12 hr / 12 hr basis 
for annual runs,
then go back and run Dec-Jan only with 9 hrs daylight 15 hrs night for 
avg. window insulation.

Three loops of PEX tubing set in the slab, in the middle of the rock 
storage, and at the bottom of the rock storage
will beat active air recirculation.

The idea that  "It would seem the heat rate off the floor could increase 
momentarily when a draft of cold air hits a warm floor" is dead wrong. 
The concrete acts as a huge thermal flywheel. THIS IS RADIANT HEAT. 
There should be a separate hydronic heat zone the first 4 feet inside 
the doors, set hotter than the rest of the floor. It should be fired up 
several hours before the business opens. Do you have perimeter thermal 
breaks < 1 inch XPS foam > around the slab ? Do you have 2 inch XPS foam 
on the outside of the footings  at least 24 inches below grade? What is 
the door height vs inside ceiling height? Ceiling fans installed? What 
direction do the doors face?  <Solar: South = good>   What direction do 
the doors face?  <Wind: Winter Prevalent Direction Leeward = good>  
External wall fins / fencing to control wind installed? You have ignored 
many details .......

Fred
I did some analysis for a very large warehouse with 10 bay doors on one 
side.  The design assumed two "zones".  The interior zone which included 
the envelop loads from roof, walls, slab edge, windows, etc.  The zone also 
heated the required ventilation air.  This was done by a gas fired roof top 
unit.  The second zone was the area adjacent the bay doors.  The problem I 
had was in determining first the depth from the doors affected by the doors 
opening and second the average air change rate per hour for occupied 
hours.  Radiant gas fired heating tubes at the ceiling were used.  These 
heat up fairly quickly.  The mechanical designer thought he had designed a 
large enough system but the dock workers complained that they were too cold 
during the worst days of winter.  I was called in after the fact and from 
my research I agreed with the designers assumptions for average air change 
per hour.  Do you have any additional thoughts about this kind of facility?

If I am not mistaken, you still make the system a VAV,
but with the minimum outside air ratio at 1.0. Add a
return fan, which then becomes the exhaust fan or
fans. Each lab, if it operates differently, will need
its own separate system.

In an earlier email, I wrote:

I'm designing a 3500 sq foot residence at a 5000' desert-like elevation 
(Nevada).
The site has good sun exposure and the climate is generally dry. Typical
temperatures in Feb are 20-40 F. The building is mostly oriented 
east-west and has
a 2' deep insulated rock floor (for thermal mass) with active air 
recirculation.
ICF's will be used as well as tile over concrete (above rock floor) in 
south
facing rooms.

I received many very useful responses regarding how to simulate this 
building. As a result, I've acquired and tried to master Energy-10 (I 
was using eQuest, but that's another story). I've done 2 simulations of 
the building where the only difference is that I use either clear double 
glazing or double low-e glazing *on the south side*. All other sides use 
double low-e glazing. The reason for doing this is that many sources 
strongly suggest that using low-e glass on the south side will inhibit 
much of the solar gain. The results show that the low-e case requires 
about 1/2 the heating as the clear case. Thinking that this might be due 
to thermal mass, I increased the thermal mass and that helped reduce the 
heating needs of the clear case by about 15%.

My thinking is that for the clear glass case, I'm loosing more heat when 
there is no sun than I'm gaining when there is sun, relative to the 
low-e case. In reality, this can be helped by covering the windows when 
there is no sun, but I don't know how to simulate this in Energy-10. Is 
there a way to change the U-value at night?

Any suggestions?

All;
I simulated an existing 5-bay garage and attached 2000 sf offices in 
Colorado, and calibrated a DOE-2 model with real weather and bills. 
Infiltration must be about 65% of the annual building heat load, even 
with fairly bad walls. The owner wants to build another one with minor 
changes. The garage is heated with overhead low-intensity tube heaters 
with a combined output of 200 Btuh/sf. The high capacity can also handle 
some ventilation, if anyone ever turned it on. When it is cold and the 
doors are opened the thermostats will kick all these heaters on. With 
bay doors on each side, the room is probably over 100 ac/hr for an hour 
per day and there are a few more hours with just one door open, 
depending on occupant behavior.

I notice that radiant hydronic in-floor heat is installed in repair 
garages at 35 Btuh/sf at design conditions, much lower than my system. 
It would seem the heat rate off the floor could increase momentarily 
when a draft of cold air hits a warm floor, but is limited over time to 
the much smaller boiler capacity. So is some of the claimed savings from 
in-floor heat in these types of spaces just from less "recovery 
capacity," and less output during periods of extreme airflow.  I suppose 
I could "simulate" this by merely reducing the capacity while leaving 
the infiltration schedule the same, and I would just show more hours 
with loads not met. My old standby DOE-2 has limitations for this type 
of situation obviously. These peak infiltration events are subhourly; my 
workaround is to group them into an hour, and the calibration to monthly 
bills is actually quite good.

Does anyone know of comparisons between similar buildings with these two 
types of "radiant" heat, or have experiences with actual installations, 
or other programs. The setpoint is already down at 60F so I'm not going 
to "simulate" one system as better than another by changing the setpoint 
down.

The original TMY2 files contain global horizontal illuminance data
as well as direct normal, diffuse horizontal, and zenith illuminance.

See TMY2 format information on the NREL web site:
http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/tmy2/

Illuminance data was calculated using luminous efficacy models
developed by Perez:
http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/pubs/tmy2/appendixa.html#calc

(The EnergyPlus weather files maintain the illuminance data.)

Robert,
  Unless I am mistaken, the TMY2 data files contain integrated hourly 
values of total horizontal and direct normal illuminance.

Hi-
We are Macintosh infected office and we have just couple of PC machines on 
which we run eQUEST. 
I'd love to know if its worth investing in Virtual PC to run eQUEST on all 
the Mac's or spend more bucks and get a PC. 
Thanks in advance for any feedback.

eQuest uses DOE2.2, which has commands for sunspaces, and specific commands
for Trombe walls.  See DOE2.2 Volume 2 dictionary, page 141 and page 436.
DOE2.1e supplement gives more on how to use sunspaces, assuming the commands
didn't change completely in DOE2.2.  I can't vouch for whether these are
fully implemented in the eQuest detailed edit mode, or how well they work.

Renee,
Strangely enough, I am in the process of trying to do exactly the same
thing. Its not really possible, but you could try building an exterior wall
assembly with spandrel glass , ai gap and then your mass wall. 
We are also doing a cfd model (which should be more informative) with the
ARL lab in Penn state. 
 
Let me know if you find anything else that works in eQUEST. We should
compare notes.

	Greetings,
	
	Has anyone modeled a trombe wall in eQuest? The program seems to
want either
	a wall or a window. I know you can do this in other DOE2 programs.
And how
	can you determine the heating load from it in eQuest? Please let me
know if
	you have done this before or if you know how to?
	
	Thank you,

	Greetings,
	
	Has anyone modeled a trombe wall in eQuest? The program seems to want either
	a wall or a window. I know you can do this in other DOE2 programs. And how
	can you determine the heating load from it in eQuest? Please let me know if
	you have done this before or if you know how to?
	
	Thank you,

Good luck.

Does anyone have information on manufacturers and products designed to heat potable water with a water to water heat pump, that uses a building condenser water loop as the heat source?  

 

This can be done with industrial process heat pumps, but then need separate heat exchanger equipment to heat the potable DHW.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200505110937.AA3704781pd80000665796@gard.com>

ENERGY STAR now provides tools and recognition for architectural designs
that incorporate energy simulation.
 
The next "Designing Top Energy Performing Buildings for Your Clients"
Internet presentation on Tuesday May 17, 1:00-1:45 PM, EDT. This
presentation describes how to use ENERGY STAR's software tool Target
Finder, and how it complements energy simulation modeling and the LEED
rating system. Target Finder takes rudimentary building and occupant
data and yields the annual energy use value required if the building is
to perform in the top 25 percent of U.S. building stock. The talk will
also present strategies that will enhance performance and illustrates
how building owners and designers can readily evaluate and achieve
energy-based design targets. Decision-makers will learn how to set
realistic goals for energy use and compare simulated results to their
target. It will show designers how to compare energy simulation results
to top performing buildings using Target Finder. The Target Finder and
integrated design assistance has been developed for office buildings and
other medium to large scale buildings such as schools, hospitals and
hotels and University Residence Halls.

Attendees can receive 1 AIA CES Learning Unit in the Health, Safety,
Welfare category

ENERGY STAR also offers many other presentations on such topics as:
ENERGY STAR -- An Overview, Benchmarking Tool/Portfolio Manager, Money
for Your Energy Upgrades, The Five-Stage Approach to Building Upgrades,
Cost Savings through ENERGY STAR Purchasing, and Monitor Power
Management. To see the schedule or to register, visit
www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=business.bus_internet_presentations
<http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=business.bus_internet_presentatio

NIST has their Life Cycle Analysis software, and ASHRAE has an analysis in the Handbook under the Owning and Operating chapter of Applications the ESL has a spreadsheet that contains the ASHRAE eqs. 

The hard part is simulating it accurately, which includes the airflow, comfort and improved IAQ. Harder still is the cost savings from energy, maintenance, IAQ, etc. over the ststem life.

Hello,
Does anyone know how to perform a first cost analysis
for underfloor air plenums. I have seen something from
Center of Built environment and they have mentioned a
spreadsheet that does this life cycle cost analysis
but nothing more than that. Could anyone suggest me a
current method of performing this analysis or if there
is any guideline or tool out there that could help me
through this process.
Thanks,

The problem is in defining what is average diversity.  Two identical carparks in operation, one with a supply / exhaust system that is deemed to comply versus a second that has been engineered to meet the performance requirements of building codes, may have quite different fan diversity and thus energy use while effectively providing the same service ...  Also if it is a carpark for an office building versus retail versus entertainment precinct the movement of cars will be very different over the day / week.  Recently I obtained some BMCS status on High Speed/Low Speed/Off status for some underground carpark exhaust fans for an office / retail precinct.  If my memory serves me correctly I found the fans operated for 800 Full Load Equivalent hours / year.  While some of the run hours were at high speed, most were at low speed where fan energy is 15% or so of High Speed.
Regards,
Graham

What is this fractional multiplier, if it exists, and where did it come from?

Dear Colleagues;
In 2005 we are planning to organize The 6th  International Seminar on
Sustainable Environment and Architecture (SENVAR), from the 19th to 20th 
September in Bandung, Indonesia. As you can see from the enclosed first
call and our website,
 
www.ar.itb.ac.id/senvar6,
 
we aim at a rather broad theme BETTER LIVING ENVIRONMENT, which covers
various aspects of Living Comfort, Lighting Design, Acoustic Design, and
Sustainable Design in architecture and built environment.
Besides contribution from invited speakers, we also stimulate the
organization of a mini-seminar in parallel session. Referred proceedings
of this seminar will be published. International participants in
particular from Asian countries are cordially invited. For that reason we
also want to facilitate efforts in establishing linkages among institutes
from Asian countries.
It is with pleasure that we invite you to participate in this seminar. We
sincerely appreciate if you would kindly post the enclosed announcement,
and inform your colleagues about the event.
We look forward to your participation and thank you for your kind attention.
 
Yours sincerely,

Number 3 in the system type chart (Table 11.4.3A) states that the zones 
shall all have Parallel Fan Powered boxes.  Typically, interior zones do 
not and the Parallel fans draw air from the interior zone/plenum.  For 
modelling for LEED, is it acceptable to have the interior zones as VAV boxes?

The calculation of effective U-values is extremely important.  In addition,
local factors may have a significant effect on the effective ground
temperature, and the resulting heat transfer.  

Many buildings, including most residential buildings, have landscaping
immediately around the majority of the perimeter.  This landscaping shades
the ground, may be mulched, and is usually irrigated.  In the summer, I
suspect that the ground temperature is more likely a function of the wetbulb
temperature, rather than the drybulb.  In the winter, mulching will act as
an insulating layer.

Commercial buildings may have large expanses of concrete or black asphalt
poured around the perimeter.  I would expect that both of these surfaces
would influence the effective ground temperature, with unshaded black
asphalt resulting in the highest ground temperature.

Is anyone aware of studies that have attempted to identify and address these
types of local factors?

FYI

I would be very careful about underground calcs in DOE-2. I'm not sure about
DOE 2.2, but DOE-2 users need to follow the latest advice from LBNL
regarding effective U-values. 

Also, there is the issue of ground temps. DOE-2 uses the temps from the
weather tape, and if this is Tmy-2,  Then these are synthetic temps from
Kusuda's work in the 1960-70s, which may or may not be accurate. DOE-2 also
does not calc infiltration below grade, so this needs adjusting. Finally,
you must have CWFs turned to get an accurate answer.

Don,
In addition to Renee's points, heres my 2 bits

1. I havent done it by converting an external wall to an underground wall
before. I would be wary of just changing the properties (i.e. construction
materials). I think there is a different thermal calculation set for
underground walls than exterior walls (no solar radiation for instance), but
to be honest I havent read the DOE2.2 documentation on this. What I normally
do (and this might be what Renee was describing) is to right click on the
space that you want the underground wall. It offers 3 child components that
you can create - exterior, interior, and underground. I would pick
underground, and then copy its properties from the exterior wall, before
deleting the extrior wall.

2. If you are modelling district energy (either steam or chilled water), you
should also create meters for them.

4. yes - you can model it as an exterior shade.

To all,

A few questions regarding the modeling ability of eQuest:

1.  Can you model portions of a given shell as underground and exterior
wall?  If so, how (in the detailed mode)?


YES - IN DETAILED EDIT COPY THE EXISTING WALL THAT IS PARTIALLY UNDERGROUND
AND ADD ANOTHER WALL. CHANGE THE HEIGHT OF EACH WALL SO THAT THE TOTAL IS
THE SAME AS THE ORIGINAL WALL. CHANGE THE UNDERGROUND WALL TYPE TO
UNDERGROUND WALL AND DEFINE THE CHARACTERISTICS.

2.  The building in question gets its chilled and hot water from a central
facility.  Can you model this?

YES. IN DETAILED EDIT MODE MODEL AS DISTRICT HOT WATER AND DISTRICT CHILLED
WATER. INCLUDE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE HEAT EXCHANGERS (CONVERTERS).

3.  Can custom wall types, area types, etc be created to be used in the
Design Wizards?  Or can custom types only be used in the detailed mode?

I BELIEVE ONLY IN DETAILED EDIT MODE YOU CAN CREATE CUSTOM FEATURES.

4.  In the detailed mode, can you identify an exterior wall adjacent to a
conditioned space (ie another building that is not being modeled)?

YES.

Thank you for any input.  If you know of any resources (for eQuest
specifically) that address these issues and others please let me know.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200505041124.AA2457968pd80000658638@gard.com>

Hi,

 

I am preparing to model a number of supermarket buildings, and I am
wondering about the capabilities of DOE2.2R as compared with the EPRI
Supermarket Simulation Tool.  

 

I've been told that the EPRI tool does a much better job of modeling the
interaction between the refrigerated cases and the air handlers.  Does
DOE2.2R have improvements in this area compared to DOE2.1E?

 

Also, is there a preferred tool in terms of modeling all the latest
efficiency measures?  

 

Finally, what are the capabilities for customizing the analysis.  The
old DOE2.1E refrigeration module allowed custom functions.  Do these new
tools have similar capabilities?

 

Thanks,

Doug Maddox

Can anyone advice me on what appropriate setback temperatures are for a

Standard ASHRAE setback temps of 55F heating & 90F cooling? Or should I
be using something closer to the building setpoint temperatures?

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] eQuest question

To all,

A few questions regarding the modeling ability of eQuest:

1.  Can you model portions of a given shell as underground and exterior
wall?  If so, how (in the detailed mode)?


YES - IN DETAILED EDIT COPY THE EXISTING WALL THAT IS PARTIALLY UNDERGROUND
AND ADD ANOTHER WALL. CHANGE THE HEIGHT OF EACH WALL SO THAT THE TOTAL IS
THE SAME AS THE ORIGINAL WALL. CHANGE THE UNDERGROUND WALL TYPE TO
UNDERGROUND WALL AND DEFINE THE CHARACTERISTICS.

2.  The building in question gets its chilled and hot water from a central
facility.  Can you model this?

YES. IN DETAILED EDIT MODE MODEL AS DISTRICT HOT WATER AND DISTRICT CHILLED
WATER. INCLUDE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE HEAT EXCHANGERS (CONVERTERS).

3.  Can custom wall types, area types, etc be created to be used in the
Design Wizards?  Or can custom types only be used in the detailed mode?

I BELIEVE ONLY IN DETAILED EDIT MODE YOU CAN CREATE CUSTOM FEATURES.

4.  In the detailed mode, can you identify an exterior wall adjacent to a
conditioned space (ie another building that is not being modeled)?

YES.

Thank you for any input.  If you know of any resources (for eQuest
specifically) that address these issues and others please let me know.

I found similar results when i first started using total heat recovery
wheels.  You need to be careful of several things:
- If outdoor air and exhaust are pass through the heat exchanger all
operational hours, with the wheel speed used for capacity control (Modulate
HX), then you are paying a fan energy penalty.  The added fan energy will
heat in winter and increase your system cooling loads in the cooling season.
Dedicated fans can overcome this problem where the added static pressure is
only an issue when the heat recovery wheel is in use.

- With total heat recovery (enthalpy) you need to be very careful how you
control it.  Controlling to a mixed air temperature setpoint (dry bulb) will
likely introduce an elevated mixed air humidity level and thus place a
latent load on the coil that can easily fully offset andy reduction in
sensible load.  You can set DT and DH thresholds (depending on control
variable) for heat recovery wheel operation that will assist in overcoming
these issues.  I've checked hourly reports and have satisfied myself that
the enthalpy wheels in DOE-2.2 / Equest are doing what they should.

The 2.2 Dictionary PDF explains the leywords and options thoroughly.

Graham

A follow up on a discussion which happened a few weeks back on heat
recovery in eQUEST. I am facing a similar problem where on using an
Enthalpy wheel for heat recovery my heating energy reduces significantly
but my cooling energy also increases ( this seems incorrect). Brian you
had mentioned that the Make up Air temperature control should be set to
Mixed Air Reset instead of float to avoid recovering all year round.
However when you set this it asks for an option for capacity control.
The different options include
Trim Economizer,Bypass OA, Bypass Exhaust, Modulate HX.
Could you or anyone else explain what these different options mean and
how would they effect the results.

Thanks

Can anyone advice me on what appropriate setback temperatures are for a building with an energy recovery unit? Does it make sens to use the Standard ASHRAE setback temps of 55F heating & 90F cooling? Or should I be using something closer to the building setpoint temperatures?
 
Thanks

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200505011058.AA5833562pd80000655339@gard.com>

Dear all.
I have realized that there is not a model available in
EP for a reversible cycle air to water heat pump
(central equipment).
I'm really interested in using this unit in my EP
simulations.
Do you have a creative idea to implement something
similar to this kind of equipment in EnergyPlus?
Thanks a lot,
