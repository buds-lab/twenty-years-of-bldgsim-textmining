Dear all,

The closing date for the PostDoc opening below has been extended to 10 September.

Sincerely yours,
Pieter de Wilde


Ref: A0816

University of Plymouth, Faculty of Technology, School of Engineering

Applications are invited for an EPSRC-funded post as Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at the Environmental Building Group of the School of Engineering at the University of Plymouth starting in October 2008. The PDRA will take the lead in a research project that aims to enable facility managers to prepare and adapt their buildings to climate change.

Climate change is now recognized as the prime challenge of the 21st century. It is increasingly clear that there is a need to take action in order to adapt specific buildings to changing circumstances, in a cost-effective way. This research project will develop a novel approach to manage the risks posed to buildings by climate change. It will employ building simulation (coupled with uncertainty analysis) to quantify these risks, their consequences, and risk abatement options.

The successful candidate for this position will have a relevant track record and deep understanding of building energy simulation and building physics, including a PhD in this discipline and hands-on experience with a simulation engine like EnergyPlus or ESP-r. Experience with uncertainty analysis, risk management, software development/programming skills, and actual facility management will all be considered a plus for the position. The PDRA is expected to have excellent communication and organisational skills, allowing to maintain close links with project stakeholders (facility managers) and related research disciplines (eg climate change research, building services engineering).

This post is available from 1 October 2008 or as soon as possible thereafter for a maximum period of 24 months.

Salary ?29138 to ?33780 pa - Grade 7

Dear allAnyone knows where can I find a list of all the programs compliant with ASHRAE 140-2004? 
I know that US DOE maintains a list of programs that have performed the Standard 140-2004 tests and submitted the results ( http://www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/info/qualified_software/). Although the list only contains some of the programs compliant with ASHRAE 140-2004.Kind Regards

Why wouldn't you want the max to be 100% to take advantage of economizer
free-cooling if the climate and system configuration allowed for it.  I
agree that there are large energy implications of conditioning excessive
OA and there may be viable means to limit it when you don't need it, but
there are also large implications of cooling return air when you don't
have to.  Considering ASHRAE 90.1 mandates economizers under certain
climates, you would be penalizing yourself by capping OA.

Any thoughts?

 I agree!

Limiting outdoor air is only beneficial if you're not paying attention to
the enthalpy of the air or, in the case of a dry bulb economizer, the
changeover temperature.

Other reasons also exist for large amounts of outdoor air, such as
replacement air for exhaust systems.  When coupling even 100% outdoor air
with energy recovery, you can gain air quality and reduced energy.

Luka

Thanks for you response.  The sole reason that I'm concerned about 100% Outside Air is that the Ventilation Air is not reaching the occupied space.  The 100% OA condition typically occurs when the VAV system is in heating mode which means that the Supply Air is most likely between 90?F-95?F.  

Therefore the Supply Air has a positive buoyancy relative to the space air temperature of 70?F.  Also, the VAV damper is at its minimum position, ~30%, such that the Supply Air is not being thrown from the diffuser to counteract the positive buoyancy.   

As a result, the VAV system may be supplying 400 cfm of 100% Outside Air into the space yet possibly only 50% ever reaches the occupied space while the rest of it clings to the ceiling and exits the Return Grill.  Therefore, you have only provided 1/2 of the necessary fresh air to the space.

The two remedies are either setting a limit to the Outdoor Air Ratio or providing Fan Powered Boxes.  These strategies ensures that the Supply Air is sufficiently being thrown into the Occupied Zone.  But both have a significant energy penalty.

Does anyone have any thoughts on how to control VAV systems to make sure the fresh air reaches the occupied space while not taking a hit on energy.

Ian Doebber

Though I have not used them in design before, I know there are available VAV diffusers which maintain adequate throw lengths at reduced velocities.  Using this type of diffuser should resolve the ventilation effectiveness issue at low-flow (VAV min. ~30%) conditions.  

Also, I've just recently seen one gril/reg manufacturer come out with a linear bar grille for use on the perimeter which directs the air horizontally during cooling mode, then re-directs to a downward discharge during heating mode.  These have to be placed along the perimeter to avoid discharging hot air directly on the occupants, but it seems like a great solution for counteracting the buoyancy and stratification issues.

Unfortunately I haven't had any direct experience with these technologies yet.  Has anyone out there found these to be helpful (or not) for the discussion topic?

Thanks,

 Dan Russell, EIT

Thanks for you response.  The sole reason that I'm concerned about 100% Outside Air is that the Ventilation Air is not reaching the occupied space.  The 100% OA condition typically occurs when the VAV system is in heating mode which means that the Supply Air is most likely between 90?F-95?F.  

Therefore the Supply Air has a positive buoyancy relative to the space air temperature of 70?F.  Also, the VAV damper is at its minimum position, ~30%, such that the Supply Air is not being thrown from the diffuser to counteract the positive buoyancy.   

As a result, the VAV system may be supplying 400 cfm of 100% Outside Air into the space yet possibly only 50% ever reaches the occupied space while the rest of it clings to the ceiling and exits the Return Grill.  Therefore, you have only provided 1/2 of the necessary fresh air to the space.

The two remedies are either setting a limit to the Outdoor Air Ratio or providing Fan Powered Boxes.  These strategies ensures that the Supply Air is sufficiently being thrown into the Occupied Zone.  But both have a significant energy penalty.

Does anyone have any thoughts on how to control VAV systems to make sure the fresh air reaches the occupied space while not taking a hit on energy.

Why wouldn't you want the max to be 100% to take advantage of economizer
free-cooling if the climate and system configuration allowed for it.  I
agree that there are large energy implications of conditioning excessive
OA and there may be viable means to limit it when you don't need it, but
there are also large implications of cooling return air when you don't
have to.  Considering ASHRAE 90.1 mandates economizers under certain
climates, you would be penalizing yourself by capping OA.

Any thoughts?

ASHRAE 90.1-2004 does not specifically state anywhere a MAXIMUM OA RATIO
that a VAV system can not exceed.  Yet ASHRAE 62-2004 insinuates this
with its reference to Ventilation Effectiveness based on OA Ratio (Zp)

It would make perfect sense that a VAV system should be limited to never

heating where the effects of Thermal Stratification will cause

VAV control systems have the capability of limiting the OA Ratio which
has extremely large Energy Implications.  For example, if the MAXIMUM OA

required to maintain that higher Flow Rate.

Mixing effectiveness should not be an issue if the air is delivered via
common distribution system (the two airstreams will mix en route).  If
you're using two delivery systems, then you're probably right; good mixing
may not occur in the zone.  It seems that the mixing is not an outdoor air
problem, but rather an air distribution problem...

I suggest rethinking the 30% and 90-95 F condition.
It seems you are arguing that not enough air will reach the breathing zone.  If so, it will probably not reach the thermostat either and thus the box would open wider if allowed to do so.  Coincidently, I read the DCV appendix of Std 62 to suggest the first thing to do with an under ventilated zone is to increase its supply air volume (not increase the system OA %).

62.1 + 90.1 + 8760 = tons of fun!

Tim,

 

I don't know if the induction unit with the 2-pipe option would be
appropriate for this, but it might be worth checking out. Personally I
haven't tried it yet, but it seems to be the most appropriate.

 

Eric, 

A valance unit is essentially an induction unit. From Harvard's website
below:

Valance systems are induction units that provide cooling or heating. In
cooling mode, chilled water is circulated through finned coils in the
unit. As warm air rises, it passes over the coils, is cooled, and sinks
to the floor, creating a constant convective loop. By eliminating the
need for forced air, the cooling load is reduced. In heating mode, hot
water passes through the finned tubes. As air passes over the coils, a
layer of radiative warmth is formed across the ceiling and is radiated
back down into the space. These units eliminate the need for an
electric-driven fan to push air, saving money and energy, while reducing
draft and eliminating noise.

No warnings generated during simulation.
I've done the following but to no avail:
1. Reinstalled eQuest (before installing it I checked if I have the

2. In the component tree I checked for load, system, plant reports' defaults

3. copied just the .inp file to a new folder and opened the file from eQuest
but still have the same problem. I thought may be the problem is in the .INP

Could someone help me figure out this problem?

I had an issue recently where changing the number of pumps attached to a

file.  This happened no matter what computer I used to run the file, and was
resolved as soon as I indicated only 1 pump to be used.  There were no

Hi,

I model the building but no results showed up under the life cycle cost. And
I defined the utility bills but it did not appear under the tab of
utility costs. I would appreciate any help, thought.

Many thanks,

Hi:

 

We've modeled several valance systems. Valance units are sometimes called
"passive chilled beams". They basically consist of a piece of fin-tube,
which is used for both heating and cooling, along with a drain pan to catch
condensate drips. While active chilled beams have an air supply, and could
be modeled as induction units, these do not have an air supply attached.
Typically, ventilation air is supplied through a separate dedicated outdoor
air system.

 

The easiest way to think of these is like a fan coil unit without the fan,
and that is exactly how we model them. In eQuest, set the system type to fan
coil, with chilled water and hot water coils, set the unit fan energy to
zero. One thing to watch for - valance units typically run at a low
waterside delta T (6 deg F on the cooling side)  - make sure you've
accounted for that or your pump energy will be too low.

 

We've found that for certain applications (like dormitories) valance systems
provide a high efficiency, low cost alternative, well worth considering.

 

Cheers,

 

Chris

Tim,

 

I don't know if the induction unit with the 2-pipe option would be
appropriate for this, but it might be worth checking out. Personally I
haven't tried it yet, but it seems to be the most appropriate.

 

Eric, 

A valance unit is essentially an induction unit. From Harvard's website
below:

Valance systems are induction units that provide cooling or heating. In
cooling mode, chilled water is circulated through finned coils in the unit.
As warm air rises, it passes over the coils, is cooled, and sinks to the
floor, creating a constant convective loop. By eliminating the need for
forced air, the cooling load is reduced. In heating mode, hot water passes
through the finned tubes. As air passes over the coils, a layer of radiative
warmth is formed across the ceiling and is radiated back down into the
space. These units eliminate the need for an electric-driven fan to push
air, saving money and energy, while reducing draft and eliminating noise.

Hi,

Does anyone know how to position windows on the building exterior wall that
are pivoted 30 degrees to both the vertical and horizontal planes, as
opposed to conventional construction where the orientation of the windows is
parallel to the building exterior?

Thanks for any help that you can provide!

Alexandra,

Windows will follow the orientation of the wall on which they are located.
You can create an exterior wall positioned appropriately, then put the
window on that wall.  You will need to reduce the surface area of the
existing exterior wall so that you don't double-account for heat loss.

Remember also that just because it is cold outside, doesn't mean all zones will be in heating mode.

Any core areas, or other areas with lots of internal gains from occupancy or equipment, or high exhaust requirements, might not be at minimum VAV.

>From your question you may be specifically looking at some perimeter zones which might be at minimum airflow even when fully occupied.

component tree), and select Create Design Day.  Enter the parameters it asks

Todd, 

You can tell eQUEST to run multiple Design Days by setting the start day and
the number of days in the Design Day Properties dialog box in the detailed
interface (don't know about the wizard).  For example I normally set the
start day to 6/1 and the number of days to 120.  That way it will cover all
the solar angles from June - September combined with the ASHRAE Cooling DB /
WB, and will use the heating/cooling design day schedules specified in the
Week Schedules.  I figure this should pretty much cover it, although as Carol
said there is usually a peak in the weather file that exceeds the ASHRAE
conditions.

Todd,

If you put in any data at all in the DD screens and run eQUEST it will 
do the DD sizing off that information. If you delete the data on those 
screens, however, and let the model run using the TMY data you should 
get output that looks more like what you want. The TMY data extremes are 
frequently higher than the DD input from ASHRAE and do include all the 
solar info. Try it out and see what you think.

eQuest and another peak sizing program to see how different the loads would
be for such a case.  The eQuest model solar gains were only about 35% of what
the sizing program calculated.  I believe this is because the sizing program
always assumes a clear day to size equipment for peaks, while the eQuest
weather files use average data.  Each kind of calculation serves a purpose,
one for sizing and one for simulation, but relying on the simulation weather
file to size equipment seems risky.  Everything may turn out ok in these
cases because the temperature is less in October than in the summer, but I'm
not to a point where I'd trust it yet.

You make a good point about the Air Not Reaching the Thermostat.  Based on this effect, the VAV system would provide more airflow which might improve the ventilation in the space but then the zone would be over heated.  The problem has then switched from a poorly ventilated space to a thermally uncomfortable space.  Again, there would be negative energy implications.

Regarding your second point, specifying a maximum OA Ratio would maintain a higher supply air volume.  For a VAV System with Demand Controlled Ventilation (DCV), the Supply Air Flow is controlled to meet two conditions (Temperature Setpoint & CO2 PPM).  When the temperature is satisfied then the VAV Box controls the Damper based on CO2 PPM.  

For example, the Space is at the correct temperature but needs 200 cfm of Outdoor Air.  If the VAV System is allowed to provide a 100% OA Ratio, then only 200 cfm of conditioned air is supplied.  If the VAV System is limited to 50% OA Ratio, then 400 cfm of conditioned air is supplied.  The later scenario ensures that the Fresh Air is thrown into the occupied space.

I suggest rethinking the 30% and 90-95 F condition.
It seems you are arguing that not enough air will reach the breathing zone.  If so, it will probably not reach the thermostat either and thus the box would open wider if allowed to do so.  Coincidently, I read the DCV appendix of Std 62 to suggest the first thing to do with an under ventilated zone is to increase its supply air volume (not increase the system OA %).

62.1 + 90.1 + 8760 = tons of fun!

Thanks for you response.  The sole reason that I'm concerned about 100% Outside Air is that the Ventilation Air is not reaching the occupied space.  The 100% OA condition typically occurs when the VAV system is in heating mode which means that the Supply Air is most likely between 90?F-95?F.

Therefore the Supply Air has a positive buoyancy relative to the space air temperature of 70?F.  Also, the VAV damper is at its minimum position, ~30%, such that the Supply Air is not being thrown from the diffuser to counteract the positive buoyancy.

As a result, the VAV system may be supplying 400 cfm of 100% Outside Air into the space yet possibly only 50% ever reaches the occupied space while the rest of it clings to the ceiling and exits the Return Grill.  Therefore, you have only provided 1/2 of the necessary fresh air to the space.

The two remedies are either setting a limit to the Outdoor Air Ratio or providing Fan Powered Boxes.  These strategies ensures that the Supply Air is sufficiently being thrown into the Occupied Zone.  But both have a significant energy penalty.

Does anyone have any thoughts on how to control VAV systems to make sure the fresh air reaches the occupied space while not taking a hit on energy.

Why wouldn't you want the max to be 100% to take advantage of economizer
free-cooling if the climate and system configuration allowed for it.  I
agree that there are large energy implications of conditioning excessive
OA and there may be viable means to limit it when you don't need it, but
there are also large implications of cooling return air when you don't
have to.  Considering ASHRAE 90.1 mandates economizers under certain

that a VAV system can not exceed.  Yet ASHRAE 62-2004 insinuates this

VAV control systems have the capability of limiting the OA Ratio which

required to maintain that higher Flow Rate.

Has anyone ever incorporated a MAXIMUM OA RATIO in their VAV System

James,

Try the EnergyPlus weather service. It's free and convenient but there are
sometimes data gaps:
http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/cfm/weatherdata/weather_re
quest.cfm

I'm not sure if they have weather back to 2003 though. You can also try a
paid service such as the National Climatic Data Center or the Weather Bank
for high quality, validated weather data. 

Good luck,
Hwakong

I may be missing something in this thread, but it occurred to me that none
of the mixing being discussed here is known by an energy analysis program
unless there's something out there which incorporates a CFD capability.

Lacking CFD, you're back to good engineering design practices for the air
distribution system.

Historical weather data is available for free at this link:
http://www.wunderground.com/history/
I do not know, however, how hard it would be to import this data into
any of the programs we are using.  It looks like it would be easy enough
to create design days from this data.

I finally got around to looking at the nrel.gov link referenced in the

data.

Does anyone know where to find, for example, the actual, hour-by-hour,

MI?

I'm modeling an existing building in Trane Trace and have utility data

where to obtain real hourly data in TMY2 format?

Message-ID: <A6D2CA56F188534E9C3AA144D5305BDC0498CE42@pae-mail.pae.com>

Sim list,

                I am using eQUEST 3.61e to create a baseline building
from my proposed. In order to change to Apdx G - system 5 (Packaged VAV
w/reheat) I need to remove the chiller since it will use DX cooling.
Sounds easy enough, however after changing all air-side systems to DX
and I cannot delete the chiller due to a 'keyword' assignment. eQUEST
tells me that the keyword assignment 'cannot be reassigned to another
component' and therefore the chiller cannot be deleted.

I have removed the pump since it is a child component and this does not
seem to change the keyword assignment. I read through the DOE 2.2 topics
manual and I still am unable to identify where this keyword assignment
might be coming from. Any ideas?

 

Thanks

Greetings,

As you may have heard, the inaugural meeting of the New York City
chapter of the International Building Performance and Simulation
Association (IBPSA-USA-NYC) will be held on September 15 at 6:30 PM at
the Buro Happold offices located at 100 Broadway, 23rd Floor. At our
first meeting, we will discuss "simulation checks", and ways of ensuring
accuracy of models results.  Our first meeting will also serve as a
forum for generating ideas about future topics of discussion.  We've
already come up with a few ideas about topics -- like envelope modeling,
UFAD, radiant cooling, Lab Modeling, Complex glazing systems, Green Roof
modeling, and Case Studies -- but are interested in your input as well.
Bring your modeling problems and frustrations as well as your
break-throughs and solutions.  Feel free to bring laptops to facilitate
discussion about particular modeling software.

Yuvaraj,

                Thanks! There was a report associated with it from
calibrating the proposed model - gets me every time! I usually shy away
from the INP when it comes to systems. Just goes to show that sometimes
the INP is a  better place to get some perspective.

Eric,

The easy way would be to open the "inp" file and do a search/find of the
chiller name. You would be able to find all the components to which this
chiller is associated. Go to that component and remove the chiller from
it. Hope it helps!

Regards,

Yuvaraj

Eric, 

 

I understand System 3 (PSZ-AC) to be a standard packaged rooftop that
may serve multiple "spaces", but only serves a single "thermal zone".
In other words, there is only one thermostat that controls the entire
unit.

 

Your baseline should have a separate PSZ-AC for each thermal zone
depicted by your HVAC drawings.  Note that adjacent thermal zones with
similar load characteristics (light/equip gain, people count, exterior
exposure, etc.) may be lumped into a single thermal zone for modeling
purposes (i.e. less zones = simpler model).

 

Hope that helps.

 

 Dan Russell, EIT

energy bills. That's not to say it can't be done, but I don't think
that's what eQuest was designed for. HEED was specifically designed for
homes <http://www2.aud.ucla.edu/energy-design-tools/> , and has a fairly
user friendly interface. Again, I don't have much experience modeling
homes, but I think you might be better off starting there. I'm also
copying the Building Simulation list to see if anyone there has anything
better to say on the subject.

Is equest effective for single-family homes energy modelling?

I agree with Dan.  The 90.1 User's Manual is a bit more clear on this
subject, and references that a PSZ unit is created for each thermal
zone.

Eric, 

 

I understand System 3 (PSZ-AC) to be a standard packaged rooftop that
may serve multiple "spaces", but only serves a single "thermal zone".
In other words, there is only one thermostat that controls the entire
unit.

 

Your baseline should have a separate PSZ-AC for each thermal zone
depicted by your HVAC drawings.  Note that adjacent thermal zones with
similar load characteristics (light/equip gain, people count, exterior
exposure, etc.) may be lumped into a single thermal zone for modeling
purposes (i.e. less zones = simpler model).

 

Hope that helps.

Sim List,

                ASHRAE system 3 is, Packaged Single Zone Air Conditioner
(PSZ-AC). The description of PSZ-AC says, "Packaged rooftop air
conditioner". I assume that this means a single unit serving multiple
zones. This doesn't seem to make sense since the name contains the
phrase 'single zone'.

                I have a building with baseline system 3, PSZ-AC and I'm
not sure how to apply this system. The proposed building has a variety
of systems. Should I have a system per zone or a single unit for the
building?

 

Thanks

I would be leery about combining zones as the baseline cooling efficiency, fan power, and economizer should be set by each unit's tonnage, cfm, and sf respectively.  Further it is not your design cfm & tonnage but rather the baseline autosized cfm & tonnage.

Also be sure you know your software because some programs will allow you to but more than one zone on a "single zone system" and then model no control or reheat on the secondary zones, either of which be outside the intent of Appendix G's system 3.

Kind of depends on what modelling tool you choose.  DesignBuilder make this
easy as you just draw the ground next to the building using the ground
obstructions component type (from memory) and it then assigns the correct
adjacency conditions to your model.  To do different wall panels you just
use sub-panels.
 
IES, you can do similar you just have to set adjacency conditions within the
model.  Seeing they now have their google sketchup link that might make it
quite easy to do too.  Same sort of thing in TAS.
 
Not sure in E-quest, but I'm sure someone will let you know.

I think there's some confusion about spaces vs zones. A thermal zone can 
have many spaces and be served by one packaged single zone system (PSZ). 
A multizone system is one system serves each space/zone. While you can 
attach more than one thermal zone to a PSZ system and not be technically 
wrong to do so you will have the devil to pay because of the Control 
Zone that you have to specify in eQUEST. It is almost impossible to 
specify a control zone that won't create hours loads not met for the 
other spaces in your output. There is a way around that, only specify a 
heating/cooling schedule for the control zone and leave the others 
blank, but it is far better to just create one thermal zone for each 
PSZ: that meets all the requirements related to ASHRAE, LEED, god, etc.

I hope this helps. Many years and much pain have been a great teacher.

Paul,

                Thanks for the heads-up. This is good insight! In fact
this is exactly why I am questioning my interpretation of Appx G. I have
only combined common spaces such as corridors & restrooms, however I
believe I should take a closer look to make sure that these zones have
similar exposure on their exterior surfaces.

 

Thanks again!

 

Eric

efficiency, fan power, and economizer should be set by each unit's
tonnage, cfm, and sf respectively.  Further it is not your design cfm &
tonnage but rather the baseline autosized cfm & tonnage.  

 

Also be sure you know your software because some programs will allow you
to but more than one zone on a "single zone system" and then model no
control or reheat on the secondary zones, either of which be outside the
intent of Appendix G's system 3.

	I agree with Dan.  The 90.1 User's Manual is a bit more clear on
this subject, and references that a PSZ unit is created for each thermal
zone.

	Eric, 

	 

	I understand System 3 (PSZ-AC) to be a standard packaged rooftop
that may serve multiple "spaces", but only serves a single "thermal
zone".  In other words, there is only one thermostat that controls the
entire unit.

	 

	Your baseline should have a separate PSZ-AC for each thermal
zone depicted by your HVAC drawings.  Note that adjacent thermal zones
with similar load characteristics (light/equip gain, people count,
exterior exposure, etc.) may be lumped into a single thermal zone for
modeling purposes (i.e. less zones = simpler model).

	 

	Hope that helps.

	 

	 Dan Russell, EIT

	Sim List,

	                ASHRAE system 3 is, Packaged Single Zone Air
Conditioner (PSZ-AC). The description of PSZ-AC says, "Packaged rooftop
air conditioner". I assume that this means a single unit serving
multiple zones. This doesn't seem to make sense since the name contains
the phrase 'single zone'.

	                I have a building with baseline system 3, PSZ-AC
and I'm not sure how to apply this system. The proposed building has a
variety of systems. Should I have a system per zone or a single unit for
the building?

	 

	Thanks

Carol,
I agree mostly but I would reverse your last statement to say to create one PSZ-AC or PSZ-HP per thermal zone.  Remember in Appendix G, the modeler does not get to decide the HVAC zoning.  Per Table G3.1.8, the zoning is the design zoning if it exists or a prescribed zoning of core & 15' perimeter zones by glazed orientation etc...

(If your proposed is multiple zone VAV and your baseline is going to be PSZ-AC or PSZ-HP, do a little reading and thinking before choosing the PSZ system type in eQUEST/DOE-2.2 or you might have many years and much pain as a great teacher on one project).

I have always assumed that it would be technically wrong to put more than one zone on your PSZ-AC or PSZ-HP but I guess I can not cite a code section to prove it.  Can anyone else or other opinions?

I think there's some confusion about spaces vs zones. A thermal zone can
have many spaces and be served by one packaged single zone system (PSZ).
A multizone system is one system serves each space/zone. While you can
attach more than one thermal zone to a PSZ system and not be technically
wrong to do so you will have the devil to pay because of the Control
Zone that you have to specify in eQUEST. It is almost impossible to
specify a control zone that won't create hours loads not met for the
other spaces in your output. There is a way around that, only specify a
heating/cooling schedule for the control zone and leave the others
blank, but it is far better to just create one thermal zone for each
PSZ: that meets all the requirements related to ASHRAE, LEED, god, etc.

I hope this helps. Many years and much pain have been a great teacher.

Carol,
	I believe that this confusion arises, for me at least, in the
fact that eQUEST only allows each zone to be assigned to one space as
described in the geometry. This also seems like it would reduce the
flexibility to rezone for different systems when doing design phase
modeling. Though I don't have enough experience to think of a good
example, it seems that this subtle point may have some important
consequences for accurate early design phase modeling.
	As for the slave zones with hours not met-I'd like to add that
I'm having trouble getting the eQUEST design airflows to match the
actual designed values as well. OA is Specified and matches closely in
both the proposed & baseline but the design airflow in the baseline is
around 10,000 CFM short! Could this be caused by a the difference in
multi & single zone systems?

Thanks

Eric

Howdy Folks:

Paul, thank you very much for the follow up.  Forgive me all, I forgot to mention the software I am using, eQuest.  It appears I may have solved my own question so I thought I'd post that back to the forum.

In eQuest I created a bunch of different 'shells' for the areas above and below the sloping grade.  Then using the manual coordinate placement of shells was able to stack them following along the grade.  Somewhat exhaustive but it seems to be working.

Thank you,
Josh

Kind of depends on what modelling tool you choose.  DesignBuilder make this easy as you just draw the ground next to the building using the ground obstructions component type (from memory) and it then assigns the correct adjacency conditions to your model.  To do different wall panels you just use sub-panels.

IES, you can do similar you just have to set adjacency conditions within the model.  Seeing they now have their google sketchup link that might make it quite easy to do too.  Same sort of thing in TAS.

Not sure in E-quest, but I'm sure someone will let you know.

Howdy Folks:

 

Paul, thank you very much for the follow up.  Forgive me all, I forgot
to mention the software I am using, eQuest.  It appears I may have
solved my own question so I thought I'd post that back to the forum. 

 

In eQuest I created a bunch of different 'shells' for the areas above
and below the sloping grade.  Then using the manual coordinate placement
of shells was able to stack them following along the grade.  Somewhat
exhaustive but it seems to be working.

 

Thank you,

Josh

Kind of depends on what modelling tool you choose.  DesignBuilder make
this easy as you just draw the ground next to the building using the
ground obstructions component type (from memory) and it then assigns the
correct adjacency conditions to your model.  To do different wall panels
you just use sub-panels.

 

IES, you can do similar you just have to set adjacency conditions within
the model.  Seeing they now have their google sketchup link that might
make it quite easy to do too.  Same sort of thing in TAS.

 

Not sure in E-quest, but I'm sure someone will let you know.

The University of Idaho, Integrated Design Lab (UI-IDL) in Boise, Idaho has
an excellent opportunity for a Building Simulation Specialist to work in a
dynamic academic research and professional outreach setting committed to
reducing energy use in buildings while supporting high quality design and
ensuring exceptional levels of human comfort.  The UI-IDL conducts research
projects in areas of energy efficiency and human factors related to the
design and operation of daylighting, passive and hybrid cooling, and
alternative heating and ventilating systems.  Results from research
activities feed into professional collaborations with architects and
engineers on new construction projects and major renovations providing a
living laboratory for the application of new strategies.  Research feeds
practice, practice feeds research, and both mesh with teaching.

The UI-DIL is a member of the Pacific Northwest University Lab Network, a
semi-formal collaborative relationship held between the Boise lab and labs
at the University of Oregon in Eugene and Portland, the University of
Washington in Seattle, Washington State University in Spokane, and Montana
State University in Bozeman. [www.integrateddesignlab.com]

Boise is a growing city in a high desert climate with excellent proximity to
outdoor activities.  It is just a few hours drive to world class skiing and
a few pedals from world class mountain biking.  Boise was recently ranked by
Money Magazine as one of the top ten Best Places to Live in the US.
Boiseans enjoy four distinct seasons with hot-dry summers and mild winters,
an historic pedestrian-friendly downtown, high quality of life and
relatively low cost of housing.  Centrally located within the Western United
States, Boise is just a quick hop from several cities including Seattle,

Hello,

I have run into a difficult situation in equest.  I decided one day to
go into the building shell and manually enter in the area and then it

So I went in and tried to change it back to the way it was and it keeps

For some reason eQUEST won't allow a Restore Default on this particular
item.  So, you have to delete the AREA reference in the .inp file.  

 

If you open the file and search for the space name that is giving you
troubles, find the line that defines AREA.  Delete this entire line and
the program will revert to the calculated area based on the polygon
definition.

I have submitted two projects for LEED C&S.  In both cases the budget 
case was assigned the PSZ-AC system.  I used one system per zone 
regardless of how the proposed model systems were assigned 
zones.  The proposed designs both had multiple zone systems.  The 
LEED reviewer agreed with how I modelled the baseline case.

Sim List,
	I'm simulating a LEED DES model of a campus central steam plant.
Under the new requirements discussed below specifically addressing 'step
1'. The way that I read the document, step 1 requires that the "upstream
equipment [be] modeled as COST neutral" (Table 1, p.4) while the
baseline DES system is compared with a proposed system "As Designed"
(Table 3, p.6) which suggests that the upstream DES equipment (including
its inefficiencies) shall be modeled in the proposed building for step
1.
	If I am reading this correctly, it would be much more difficult
to acquire the required 2 points for certification (14% - NC) than
previously suggested.
	Also, the comparison for systems not directly affected by the
DES central plant (chiller in my case) is not necessarily a direct
comparison. My building is ~75,000 SF & 3 floors (fossil fuel /
purchased heat), therefore according to Table G3.1.1A & B my baseline is
system 5 Packaged VAV w/Reheat - cooling type: direct expansion.

Any and all thoughts on this topic are welcome

Thanks

Eric

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] District Thermal System

It seems that the intention here is that if a credit is taken for an
exemplary LEED building for energy efficiency, it will have to overcome
district energy system (DES) inefficiencies if they are present.  But at
the same time, you are able to get the minimum two EAC1 credits, to some
degree regardless of how bad the DES performs - so not excluding most
projects, but limiting the options for those projects with inefficient
infrastructures.  This recognizes some of the constraints that a campus
project might encounter.

Likewise an efficient DES that may have efficient equipment,
cogeneration, heat recovery or other efficiencies will benefit the LEED
project and the team is rewarded for having built onto this type of
system.


Step 1:  Building stand-alone scenario - for EAP2 compliance as well as
documenting up to two EAC1 credits.  In both cases will be purchased
from district energy systems for heating and cooling as appropriate.
This I think was the discrepancy between Fred and Julia's posts - the
USGBC document states on page 8 that the actual prices are to be used,
so it would include the overhead and profit components for a commercial
DES.  For campus situations without a "price" you must calculate the
equivalent value and it isn't specified if this includes the overhead
components.

If your building used DES for only one source, then the other source
would be modeled as proposed with the baseline equipment per App G.

So as Fred mentioned, it will be DES vs DES, chiller vs chiller, or
boiler vs boiler, etc.

If only pursuing EAP2 and two or fewer EAC1 credits (and achieving
them?), stop here.


Step 2:  Aggregate building - for pursuit of additional EAC1 credits -
here the DES will be modeled for electricity and fuel usage, and
compared to a building with baseline heating and cooling equipment per
App G.

The key point of the text is "virtual on-site equipment representing
upstream" systems.  So not exactly that system, but representing the
LEED project's share of that system.

Putting some numbers to a cooling plant for example purposes, the
intention is not for you to model a 500 ton load building being served
by a plant with four 5,000 ton chillers.  Neither is the intention that
you should model the other buildings making up the 19,500 ton
difference.

The simulation programs are generally able to use efficiency
calculations based on the total plant, but imposed on a theoretical
smaller "virtual" plant serving the load of the new project.  This is a
reasonable approximation to the share of the plant energy for the new
project assuming the cooling/heating loads are following the profile of
the DES in general.  The virtual 500 ton chiller will have capacity
specified to match the LEED project's demand, but with the efficiency
curves and EIR of the existing 5,000 ton chillers.

Obviously the capacity of everything in the plant would have to be
adjusted, not just the chillers and boilers - include pumps, cooling
towers, etc.

There is a statement about Step 2 only providing up to four additional
EAC1 credits over Step 1, up to a maximum total of ten credits (like
normal).  But my interpretation of the document is that even if you
documented six EAC1 credits in step 1, you can only claim two of them
unless you unlocked that potential by proceeding to Step 2.  Is this
everyone else's interpretation also?

Hope this helps!

David

Thanks Paul,
	I guess I was just stating that the comparisons on equipment are
not so direct when you have one source from a DES system. Also, I'm not
really sure if I'm interpreting correctly that the DES being modeled in
the proposed but not in the baseline is fitting the intent of holding
the upstream equipment cost neutral. I suppose that it is as long as the
heating source is separately metered and the rate applied is the same.

Thanks,

Eric

Eric,
You stated you were using campus steam but I don't quite follow the last
paragraph or what you are doing on cooling.

If you are installing a chiller in & for your building, yes the tables
G3.1.1A & B stand and you might have chiller versus DX in both Step 1
and Step 2.

If you are using campus chilled water then step 1 has both models with
purchased chilled water and step 2 has your campus system versus the
Table G3.1.1A & B system.

There is an ASHRAE 90.1 addenda that you can elect to follow that
changes the crossover points for Table G3.1.1A.  You may want to track
that down but I would guess it might save you some effort at the cost of
reduced savings.

I agree the new document generally makes it harder to show the 14%
savings.

Good luck,
Paul

Sim List,
        I'm simulating a LEED DES model of a campus central steam plant.
Under the new requirements discussed below specifically addressing 'step
1'. The way that I read the document, step 1 requires that the "upstream
equipment [be] modeled as COST neutral" (Table 1, p.4) while the
baseline DES system is compared with a proposed system "As Designed"
(Table 3, p.6) which suggests that the upstream DES equipment (including
its inefficiencies) shall be modeled in the proposed building for step
1.
        If I am reading this correctly, it would be much more difficult
to acquire the required 2 points for certification (14% - NC) than
previously suggested.
        Also, the comparison for systems not directly affected by the
DES central plant (chiller in my case) is not necessarily a direct
comparison. My building is ~75,000 SF & 3 floors (fossil fuel /
purchased heat), therefore according to Table G3.1.1A & B my baseline is
system 5 Packaged VAV w/Reheat - cooling type: direct expansion.

Any and all thoughts on this topic are welcome

Thanks

Eric

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] District Thermal System

It seems that the intention here is that if a credit is taken for an
exemplary LEED building for energy efficiency, it will have to overcome
district energy system (DES) inefficiencies if they are present.  But at
the same time, you are able to get the minimum two EAC1 credits, to some
degree regardless of how bad the DES performs - so not excluding most
projects, but limiting the options for those projects with inefficient
infrastructures.  This recognizes some of the constraints that a campus
project might encounter.

Likewise an efficient DES that may have efficient equipment,
cogeneration, heat recovery or other efficiencies will benefit the LEED
project and the team is rewarded for having built onto this type of
system.


Step 1:  Building stand-alone scenario - for EAP2 compliance as well as
documenting up to two EAC1 credits.  In both cases will be purchased
from district energy systems for heating and cooling as appropriate.
This I think was the discrepancy between Fred and Julia's posts - the
USGBC document states on page 8 that the actual prices are to be used,
so it would include the overhead and profit components for a commercial
DES.  For campus situations without a "price" you must calculate the
equivalent value and it isn't specified if this includes the overhead
components.

If your building used DES for only one source, then the other source
would be modeled as proposed with the baseline equipment per App G.

So as Fred mentioned, it will be DES vs DES, chiller vs chiller, or
boiler vs boiler, etc.

If only pursuing EAP2 and two or fewer EAC1 credits (and achieving
them?), stop here.


Step 2:  Aggregate building - for pursuit of additional EAC1 credits -
here the DES will be modeled for electricity and fuel usage, and
compared to a building with baseline heating and cooling equipment per
App G.

The key point of the text is "virtual on-site equipment representing
upstream" systems.  So not exactly that system, but representing the
LEED project's share of that system.

Putting some numbers to a cooling plant for example purposes, the
intention is not for you to model a 500 ton load building being served
by a plant with four 5,000 ton chillers.  Neither is the intention that
you should model the other buildings making up the 19,500 ton
difference.

The simulation programs are generally able to use efficiency
calculations based on the total plant, but imposed on a theoretical
smaller "virtual" plant serving the load of the new project.  This is a
reasonable approximation to the share of the plant energy for the new
project assuming the cooling/heating loads are following the profile of
the DES in general.  The virtual 500 ton chiller will have capacity
specified to match the LEED project's demand, but with the efficiency
curves and EIR of the existing 5,000 ton chillers.

Obviously the capacity of everything in the plant would have to be
adjusted, not just the chillers and boilers - include pumps, cooling
towers, etc.

There is a statement about Step 2 only providing up to four additional
EAC1 credits over Step 1, up to a maximum total of ten credits (like
normal).  But my interpretation of the document is that even if you
documented six EAC1 credits in step 1, you can only claim two of them
unless you unlocked that potential by proceeding to Step 2.  Is this
everyone else's interpretation also?

Hope this helps!

David

 Dear Eric,

The Proposed system savings is built up from
* better wall and window constructions (resulting in smaller loads)
* better lighting design (resulting in smaller loads)
* more efficient equipment for HVAC
* operated with greater sophistication

When you put all of those together, 14+% is not so hard to achieve (even if
your DES is not state of the art)

I'm not sure if I'm quite following the question, but let me see if this is what you are looking for, specifically for your case of a district energy central heating plant and stand-alone cooling:

Step 1:  identical purchased heat for both cases, chiller vs DX per system selection tables in App G.  Yes this may handicap you if the cost for purchased heat is relatively high (rightly so?).  If you make two points you may choose to stop here.  Reaching 14% may require an aggressive envelope, lighting and distribution systems.  The DX vs chiller comparison may also help in your case.

Step 2:  if you think your distributed energy heating plant is relatively efficient compared to 90.1, compare a virtual model of the DES with a stand-alone boiler system per App G.  In your case if I'm understanding correctly, the cooling systems will be the same DX vs chiller in step 1 and step 2.

How is this different than before?  If your central plant is very efficient, you are able to take some credits for it in step 2, which you couldn't have done under App G alone.  If your central plant is less efficient, then you are in basically the same case as you would have been all along comparing purchased heating options in step 1.  It's not any more penalizing than before in terms of the purchased heating.

David,
	My question relates to step 1 only. My is that step 1 is not
requiring identical purchased heat for both cases. It in fact states
that the Proposed building should modeled "As Designed" while the
Baseline building is per Appx G except for heating type energy source
(Table 3, p.6).
	I'm not sure if I'm interpreting this correctly. It seems, as
you stated in the previous reply, that the intent is to hold heating
energy neutral, but the way it is stated is 'COST neutral'--not energy
neutral (Table 1, p.4 - EAc1, Step 1).

Eric

I am also in the middle of a DES project at the moment.  The way that I
interpreted Step 1 and 2 is as follows:

Step 1:

Baseline: all downstream (on-site) equipment, envelope components, etc, as
in Appendix G.  heating and cooling is purchased from a DES system.
Proposed: all downstream (on-site) equipment, envelope components, etc, as
designed.  Heating and cooling is purchased from a DES system.

Step 2:

Baseline: all equipment is modeled as on-site.  Boilers and Chillers are to
be modeled as designed in Appendix G.  Utility rates are to be local utility
rates
Proposed: building is to be modeled as built.  Heating and cooling is
purchased from a DES system, energy costs must take into account DES
production and transmission losses.

In my opinion, the vocabulary in Table 1 is confusing, but the guidelines on
pages 5 and 6 seem pretty clear.  Am I on the same page as everyone else
here?

Thanks,

--
Karen

By "cost neutral" The intent is that both design and baseline case are to be served from purchased heating at the same price and/or efficiency.

The needed 14% savings has to come from differences between the cases depending on the savings from envelope, lighting, AHUs, controls, renewables, etc.

If your building purchases steam for instance, if the tariff rate is $29.227/mlbs, then both cases purchase the appropriate amount of steam at that price.  If you have an internal campus situation you may calculate or simulate some other rate in place of an actual tariff.

In step 2, you would compare the effectiveness of $29.227/mlbs steam in the design case vs App G. boilers for the baseline case, with prevailing natural gas prices.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Exhaust fans
Message-ID: <5166c4930809091311y5cd8a41dudcde7c9a39677562@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have modeled a residential building. When I assign the exhaust fans for
the apartments and the common area, the simulation results showed errors. I
am wondering if anyone has the encountered the same problem?

Any thought or help would be appreciated.

Eric, David & Karen,
Thank you so much for discussing this document!  It needs it.
I agree Karen & David through step 1.
But as I read Step 2, the proposed model must include analysis of the DES plant in such a way as to show the conversion from loads at the building to corresponding fuel consumption at the DES plant to corresponding dollars.  If you could stop at the dollars per load charged to the building, why did the anonymous authors provide default efficiencies and losses on page 8.

That is not to say that I agree with how the document is written.  I still have the following issues:
- does the document imply all baseline DES cooling systems are electric?
- does the document imply all baseline DES heating systems are natural gas?
- whose rates are applied to the DES energy consumption? The building's or the DES's?

The document anticipates refinement and invites correspondence to leedinfo at usgbc.org.

Has anyone submitted a Step 2 model to the USBGC and received feedback or approval?  If so, please share.

Paul Riemer

By "cost neutral" The intent is that both design and baseline case are to be served from purchased heating at the same price and/or efficiency.

The needed 14% savings has to come from differences between the cases depending on the savings from envelope, lighting, AHUs, controls, renewables, etc.

If your building purchases steam for instance, if the tariff rate is $29.227/mlbs, then both cases purchase the appropriate amount of steam at that price.  If you have an internal campus situation you may calculate or simulate some other rate in place of an actual tariff.

In step 2, you would compare the effectiveness of $29.227/mlbs steam in the design case vs App G. boilers for the baseline case, with prevailing natural gas prices.

I am also in the middle of a DES project at the moment.  The way that I interpreted Step 1 and 2 is as follows:

Step 1:

Baseline: all downstream (on-site) equipment, envelope components, etc, as in Appendix G.  heating and cooling is purchased from a DES system.
Proposed: all downstream (on-site) equipment, envelope components, etc, as designed.  Heating and cooling is purchased from a DES system.

Step 2:

Baseline: all equipment is modeled as on-site.  Boilers and Chillers are to be modeled as designed in Appendix G.  Utility rates are to be local utility rates
Proposed: building is to be modeled as built.  Heating and cooling is purchased from a DES system, energy costs must take into account DES production and transmission losses.

In my opinion, the vocabulary in Table 1 is confusing, but the guidelines on pages 5 and 6 seem pretty clear.  Am I on the same page as everyone else here?

Thanks,

Karen

I have encountered lots of interesting results when using exhaust fans.  One
thing to note is that if your fan operation is "Intermittent" "track
exhaust" doesn't work.  what system type is assigned?

Karen & David,

                Thank you for your input on this topic. I tend to agree
with both of you about the intent but I would have a hard time pointing
to any specific text if anyone were to disagree with this
interpretation. The wording is a bit unclear. Pages 5 & 6 seem to simply
refer back to tables 2 & 3.

 

Good luck with your project Karen...

 

Eric

I am also in the middle of a DES project at the moment.  The way that I
interpreted Step 1 and 2 is as follows:

Step 1:

Baseline: all downstream (on-site) equipment, envelope components, etc,
as in Appendix G.  heating and cooling is purchased from a DES system.
Proposed: all downstream (on-site) equipment, envelope components, etc,
as designed.  Heating and cooling is purchased from a DES system.

Step 2:

Baseline: all equipment is modeled as on-site.  Boilers and Chillers are
to be modeled as designed in Appendix G.  Utility rates are to be local
utility rates
Proposed: building is to be modeled as built.  Heating and cooling is
purchased from a DES system, energy costs must take into account DES
production and transmission losses.

In my opinion, the vocabulary in Table 1 is confusing, but the
guidelines on pages 5 and 6 seem pretty clear.  Am I on the same page as
everyone else here?

Thanks,

--
Karen

Sorry, correction to my earlier post -- for Step 2 it should be a virtual DES, regardless of if you have a tariff to use or not.  The virtual plant would be consuming equivalent fuels to produce the DES services.

Message-ID: <BCE934DE8D0F4B86BD3D59D14DA93B34@dv6000>

Hi,
 
In eQuest, the PS-B report and .CSV file give the same number for electrical
demand. But a different number is on the ES-E report (slightly higher in
each case I've looked at).  May I ask why?  And, which is correct?  It
doesn't seem to be related to exterior-power which is included in the .CSV
file. 
 
Thanks,

Message-ID: <4D8F7D3FB97DDD4D9CBA9FE0CD7EEAF0ECE5FD@vesuvius.rumseyengineers.com>

Hello,

 

I was almost sure that eQUEST/DOE-2.2 had a built-in control mode to
reset the tower-leaving condenser-water setpoint relative to outdoor
wet-bulb temperature.  After puzzling over why I couldn't find it in the
GUI, I eventually realized that I was thinking of EnergyPro/DOE-2.1e.
This is a fairly common control strategy for open towers, so I was
wondering why this feature disappeared between DOE-2 releases and what
others are doing to simulate this control mode using eQUEST.

 

Of course, COOL-SETPT-CTRL = OA-RESET is based on dry-bulb.  So you
could assume a constant wet-bulb depression and use a SUPPLY-LO greater
than SUPPLY-HI (this is allowed, right?), but this is very crude.

 

I guess you could use COOL-SETPT-CTRL = SCHEDULED, parse the hourly
wet-bulb temps out of the weather file, add the tower design approach to
everything, and dump those values into a COOL-SETPT-SCH (hopefully using
a perl script or something).  However, SCHEDULEs are limited to 12
WEEK-SCHEDULEs, so it's not really possible to define a schedule of 8760
arbitrary values.  But even if you could, it seems to me that there's a
reason the weather file has hourly wet-bulb data in it, and one of them
is to avoid having to do stuff like this...  

 

I had thought of using user expressions, but I think eQUEST evaluates
these when it generates the BDL, so they wouldn't be evaluated during
the simulation for each hour.  I'm pretty sure there's no user variable
for current outdoor wet-bulb temp anyway, because this isn't something
that can be evaluated ahead of time.  Is this something that can be done
with DOE-2 subroutines/functions (I haven't played with those yet)?
Something like:

 

MAGIC-EXPRESSION = OA-WB-T + DESIGN-APPROACH ..

TWR-SETPT-SCH = SCHEDULE THRU DEC 31 (ALL) (1,24) (MAGIC-EXPRESSION) ..

 

The idea is that MAGIC-EXPRESSION would be evaluated every time DOE-2
references the value of TWR-SETPT-SCH for the current hour.

 

Should I put this on the list of ECMs where I have to tell people that I
can't really model that, or is there hope after all?

 

Thanks,

Jeff

I think this depends largely on your budget and proficiency.
 
If you want to go full on with CFD, then I'd suggest Fluent
(http://www.fluent.com/) everyday.  It is very widely used and well trusted
tool.  ICEM is a good meshing tool, but we like Pointwise and Gridgen for
it's meshing simplicity.
 
Other than that, I know CCM+ from CD-Adapco (http://www.cd-adapco.com/) is
very good too.  Makes the job quite easy.  These tools are very expensive
though.
 
If you want the same sort of capability and are willing to use mainly text
input then I'd suggest OpenFoam (http://www.openfoam.org) - a very powerful
open source CFD tool.  You could use something like pointwise to mesh it,
output a fluent case file and then openfoam has it's own fluent case file
converter program which you could use to then convert it and process it.
You'd probably need a decent post processor too, but clearly then you are
only paying for those programs as openfoam itself is free.    If you can do
it all by text then you wouldn't need to pay anything at all.  It will
require you to use Linux though.  I saw a pre-compiled bootable live CD
distro of this recently which was quite impressive so it allows you to check
it out just by inserting CD into computer and booting to it.  The link for
that is:  http://www.caelinux.com/CMS/
 
 
Of the cheaper and possibly more usable programs for quick built environment
analysis.  Cham Pheonics (http://www.cham.co.uk/)  is good value for money.
It's Flair add on is pretty simple to use.  I'd still personally get a good
CAD program to make sure your geometry is spot on before importing it, but
then it would do the job well.  A lot of companies use it becasue of it's
relative simplicity and good price.
 
Another which is aimed at non-CFD experts is DesignBuilder CFD
(http://www.designbuilder.co.uk/).  It is in beta test stage and looks
promising.  It'll be great for simple stuff.  Wouln't recommend anything
that uses just cartesian grids for complex jobs, but for the large majority
of jobs it will suit, especially if it's internal room flows, etc.  Should
be quite competitive on the price too.
 
Hope that helps.

Paul

Paul,
Thanks for such detailed information! They are really helpful. Do you have
any experience with Airpak and Flovent? Heard that these two tools are
specially tailored for built environment.

Thanks again.

Antixs, et al
 
Airpak is okay and is perfectly adapted to HVAC applications as it includes
fan details, etc allowing you introduce swirl, etc.  It is expensive for
what you get though.  It has improved, but the gridding was fairly rough and
ready if you get complex geometry and can throw a wobbly if you are doing
external flow analysis for things like pedestrian comfort assessments where
you could need large variance in your grid cell size.  If you are doing
rooms, etc you'll be fine.  I'd agree with Kai's comments though.
 
Not used FloVent.  It's quite pretty from memory, it's outputs are well
suited to HVAC work and make the whole CFD (Colour For Directors) stand up.
Whether it is good for complex analysis I'm not sure and will have to leave
that to others to comment on.
 
CHAM's flair is HVAC specific and there is even a link with Hevacomp so if
you've done your room calculations in that then there is a reduced version
which will let you do some basic flow analysis.  
 
The problem with most of these simplified tools however tends to be the
gridding which has a tendancy to let them down and so convergence of
solutions can be hard to achieve.  It really does depend on what you are
going to use it for and what sort of problems.
 
Sorry about copying your message below to the list Kai, but I think others
will lose the thinking of the thread and my comments as well, hope you don't
mind.

Antixs, 
 
Both Airpak and Flovent are customized CFD programs for building HVAC
applications.  Airpak wraps around the basic Fluent solver, and provides a
user-interface that is much more geared towards building engineers, as well
as some additional functions that is only available with Airpak, such as
solar heat gain.  
 
I have some experience with Airpak a while ago, being a Fluent user for many
years, I did not find any problem of learning the program and will say an
engineer without prior experience should be able to pick up the modeling
pretty quickly - the problem, however, is that if there is any issue with
the model, such as if the solution is diverging, it is very difficult to
"debug" the model in Airpak.  I assume the same would be for Flovent, so in
essence I would say they provide the easiness in "cookie-cutter"
applications. 
 
I am not copying this to the entire mailing list, as I may be talking a bit
too specific. 
 
 
Regards,
Kai

Paul,
Thanks for such detailed information! They are really helpful. Do you have
any experience with Airpak and Flovent? Heard that these two tools are
specially tailored for built environment.

Thanks again.

I think this depends largely on your budget and proficiency.
 
If you want to go full on with CFD, then I'd suggest Fluent
(http://www.fluent.com/) everyday.  It is very widely used and well trusted
tool.  ICEM is a good meshing tool, but we like Pointwise and Gridgen for
it's meshing simplicity.
 
Other than that, I know CCM+ from CD-Adapco (http://www.cd-adapco.com/) is
very good too.  Makes the job quite easy.  These tools are very expensive
though.
 
If you want the same sort of capability and are willing to use mainly text
input then I'd suggest OpenFoam (http://www.openfoam.org) - a very powerful
open source CFD tool.  You could use something like pointwise to mesh it,
output a fluent case file and then openfoam has it's own fluent case file
converter program which you could use to then convert it and process it.
You'd probably need a decent post processor too, but clearly then you are
only paying for those programs as openfoam itself is free.    If you can do
it all by text then you wouldn't need to pay anything at all.  It will
require you to use Linux though.  I saw a pre-compiled bootable live CD
distro of this recently which was quite impressive so it allows you to check
it out just by inserting CD into computer and booting to it.  The link for
that is:  http://www.caelinux.com/CMS/
 
 
Of the cheaper and possibly more usable programs for quick built environment
analysis.  Cham Pheonics (http://www.cham.co.uk/)  is good value for money.
It's Flair add on is pretty simple to use.  I'd still personally get a good
CAD program to make sure your geometry is spot on before importing it, but
then it would do the job well.  A lot of companies use it becasue of it's
relative simplicity and good price.
 
Another which is aimed at non-CFD experts is DesignBuilder CFD
(http://www.designbuilder.co.uk/).  It is in beta test stage and looks
promising.  It'll be great for simple stuff.  Wouln't recommend anything
that uses just cartesian grids for complex jobs, but for the large majority
of jobs it will suit, especially if it's internal room flows, etc.  Should
be quite competitive on the price too.
 
Hope that helps.

Paul

I am also in the middle of a DES project at the moment.? The way that I interpreted Step 1 and 2 is as follows:

Step 1:

Proposed: all downstream (on-site) equipment, envelope components, etc, as designed.? Heating and cooling is purchased from a DES system.

Step 2:

Baseline: all equipment is modeled as on-site.? Boilers and Chillers are to be modeled as designed in Appendix G.? Utility rates are to be local utility rates
Proposed: building is to be modeled as built.? Heating and cooling is purchased from a DES system, energy costs must take into account DES production and transmission losses.

In my opinion, the vocabulary in Table 1 is confusing, but the guidelines on pages 5 and 6 seem pretty clear.? Am I on the same page as everyone else here?

Antixs,
?
Airpak is specificly designed?for indoor application. It has the modules for table, human and fan etc. Also you don't need other softwares to generate the meshes because it has the mesh generator.?You should be aware the mesh is coarse and it is difficult to get good meshes near the boundary layers.?However, the engineers don't care if the Y plus value is less than 1. As fas as I know, Fluent and Airpak are both used by A/E firms. Per my experience, the 2D color vector maps? and movies are good to show your clients in the presentations. As?solid design tool for HVAC?industries, CFD has s long way to go.

Julia,

Thank you for your comments.  Please allow me to ask a bit more.

Are you stating that Table 1.8.2(b) at the bottom of your Step 2 EAc1 template will have an energy type line item of "hot water", "steam", or "chilled water"?  If so, will the numeric energy use value (e.g. 1,234 MBtu) be exactly the same as in Step 1's EAc1 template?  Meaning the only differences between the proposed columns of the two submittal templates will be the dollar costs of the DES energy stream and total costs?

Paul Riemer

Let me reiterate, that?I have not submitted my model yet to LEED.? So, I don't have any feedback from them regarding the?validity of my take on things. 

In aswer to your question: Yes and no. :)

The way I see things:

For?Step 1, the DES document talks about using a "market" rate for the DES utilities.? So, my take on that is that if there is a general prevailing rate for these utilities in your area, that should be used in Step 1.? Where as the intent for Step 2?seems to be to use info (i.e. a rate or other method as discussed below) that reflects your plant's actual efficiency.? 

In theory, for Step 1, the rate shouldn't matter since?it's effect is neutralized by using it in both the proposed and baseline models.? However, I'm thinking there may be a situation where if you have a really?stellar?(i.e. low CHW, steam, HW rate) or poor (i.e. high CHW, steam, or HW rate) performing proposed central plant and you use that rate in Step 1 in both the proposed and baseline models, it may impact your results in Step 1.??Although, again, in theory, it shouldn't matter.? But, as I do more?models,?it seems that the?relationship between $ saved and the % saved is not?linear - i.e.?as you demonstrate more and more savings, it seems easier to get to the next LEED increment with smaller amounts of deltas -?and vice versa?(which to some degree makes sense since dividing by smaller numbers).??But, I'm thinking?this effect could impact your savings in Step 1 and thus your ability to even get to Step 2.? But, maybe I'm off base
 here.? I'm speculating at this point in that regard.

That being said, it does seem?that the rate you used in Step 1 could be the same rate used in Step 2 for your proposed building and thus, the performance shown?for the proposed building models on the LEED templates?could be the same in both Steps.?

Another idea??I had was that the?DES rate could be used to back calculate the overall COP/efficiency of your plant.? And then use those figures in your proposed model for Step 2.? It may be easier to adjust those rates for distribution losses etc.? All this assumes that your DES rate is based on metered data?and actual production costs.? It seems LEED?may want some demonstration of this.??

Any idea about ANSYS CFX?

 

ANSYS own both codes now and tell me that CFX can do everything that
Fluent can do and recommended it to me really in preference to Fluent
for building applications. What's the difference?

Antixs, et al

 

Airpak is okay and is perfectly adapted to HVAC applications as it
includes fan details, etc allowing you introduce swirl, etc.  It is
expensive for what you get though.  It has improved, but the gridding
was fairly rough and ready if you get complex geometry and can throw a
wobbly if you are doing external flow analysis for things like
pedestrian comfort assessments where you could need large variance in
your grid cell size.  If you are doing rooms, etc you'll be fine.  I'd
agree with Kai's comments though.

 

Not used FloVent.  It's quite pretty from memory, it's outputs are well
suited to HVAC work and make the whole CFD (Colour For Directors) stand
up. Whether it is good for complex analysis I'm not sure and will have
to leave that to others to comment on.

 

CHAM's flair is HVAC specific and there is even a link with Hevacomp so
if you've done your room calculations in that then there is a reduced
version which will let you do some basic flow analysis.  

 

The problem with most of these simplified tools however tends to be the
gridding which has a tendancy to let them down and so convergence of
solutions can be hard to achieve.  It really does depend on what you are
going to use it for and what sort of problems.

 

Sorry about copying your message below to the list Kai, but I think
others will lose the thinking of the thread and my comments as well,
hope you don't mind.

 

Cheers

 

Paul

Antixs, 

 

Both Airpak and Flovent are customized CFD programs for building HVAC
applications.  Airpak wraps around the basic Fluent solver, and provides
a user-interface that is much more geared towards building engineers, as
well as some additional functions that is only available with Airpak,
such as solar heat gain.  

 

I have some experience with Airpak a while ago, being a Fluent user for
many years, I did not find any problem of learning the program and will
say an engineer without prior experience should be able to pick up the
modeling pretty quickly - the problem, however, is that if there is any
issue with the model, such as if the solution is diverging, it is very
difficult to "debug" the model in Airpak.  I assume the same would be
for Flovent, so in essence I would say they provide the easiness in
"cookie-cutter" applications. 

 

I am not copying this to the entire mailing list, as I may be talking a
bit too specific. 

 

 

Regards,

Kai

Paul,
Thanks for such detailed information! They are really helpful. Do you
have any experience with Airpak and Flovent? Heard that these two tools
are specially tailored for built environment.

Thanks again.

I think this depends largely on your budget and proficiency.

 

If you want to go full on with CFD, then I'd suggest Fluent
(http://www.fluent.com/) everyday.  It is very widely used and well
trusted tool.  ICEM is a good meshing tool, but we like Pointwise and
Gridgen for it's meshing simplicity.

 

Other than that, I know CCM+ from CD-Adapco (http://www.cd-adapco.com/)
is very good too.  Makes the job quite easy.  These tools are very
expensive though.

 

If you want the same sort of capability and are willing to use mainly
text input then I'd suggest OpenFoam (http://www.openfoam.org) - a very
powerful open source CFD tool.  You could use something like pointwise
to mesh it, output a fluent case file and then openfoam has it's own
fluent case file converter program which you could use to then convert
it and process it.  You'd probably need a decent post processor too, but
clearly then you are only paying for those programs as openfoam itself
is free.    If you can do it all by text then you wouldn't need to pay
anything at all.  It will require you to use Linux though.  I saw a
pre-compiled bootable live CD distro of this recently which was quite
impressive so it allows you to check it out just by inserting CD into
computer and booting to it.  The link for that is:
http://www.caelinux.com/CMS/

 

 

Of the cheaper and possibly more usable programs for quick built
environment analysis.  Cham Pheonics (http://www.cham.co.uk/)  is good
value for money.  It's Flair add on is pretty simple to use.  I'd still
personally get a good CAD program to make sure your geometry is spot on
before importing it, but then it would do the job well.  A lot of
companies use it becasue of it's relative simplicity and good price.

 

Another which is aimed at non-CFD experts is DesignBuilder CFD
(http://www.designbuilder.co.uk/).  It is in beta test stage and looks
promising.  It'll be great for simple stuff.  Wouln't recommend anything
that uses just cartesian grids for complex jobs, but for the large
majority of jobs it will suit, especially if it's internal room flows,
etc.  Should be quite competitive on the price too.

 

Hope that helps.

Regards

Paul

Hi all,

 

Just wonder what CFD softwares are popularly used for analyzing built
environemnt in architect/MEP consulting firms? Also which one is
relatively eaiser to use?

 

Many thanks.

				     ABSTRACT

       This Cookbook uses the general purpose simulation 
suite ESP-r as a
       platform to explore strategies for deploying virtual 
representations of
       the built environment to answer questions posed in 
the real world of
       design and research groups.

       The Cookbook talks about translating client questions 
into virtual rep-
       resentations that are no more and no less complex 
than is required for
       the task. It talks about re-discovering the power of 
pencils and paper
       and it dares to mention the word methodology. And 
discovering valuable
       patterns in the clutter and then learning the art of 
responding to what
       if questions. And since the author is professionally 
paranoid you might
       pick up some new definitions of the word QA.

       Almost all of the strategies presented can be applied 
to the task of
       creating elegant virtual representations in other 
simulation suites.
       Readers might alert their colleagues to take a peak.

Claire,

Not a great deal of difference as far as I know.  My friend at Buro Happold
uses CFX instead of Fluent without any problems on the work he does.  It's
possibly more tightly integrated than Fluent in ICEM or AI workbench at a
guess as they've had it longer.  As far as I know it's also cheaper and
thats got to be a good aspect as if it can do more or less the same for less
money I know which I'd be getting.  There are probably differences in the
turbulence models available, etc but without looking into a detailed
breakdown of features I can't really help there.

Regards
Paul

Any idea about ANSYS CFX?

 

ANSYS own both codes now and tell me that CFX can do everything that Fluent
can do and recommended it to me really in preference to Fluent for building
applications. What?s the difference?

 

Thanks,

Antixs, et al

 

Airpak is okay and is perfectly adapted to HVAC applications as it includes
fan details, etc allowing you introduce swirl, etc.  It is expensive for
what you get though.  It has improved, but the gridding was fairly rough and
ready if you get complex geometry and can throw a wobbly if you are doing
external flow analysis for things like pedestrian comfort assessments where
you could need large variance in your grid cell size.  If you are doing
rooms, etc you'll be fine.  I'd agree with Kai's comments though.

 

Not used FloVent.  It's quite pretty from memory, it's outputs are well
suited to HVAC work and make the whole CFD (Colour For Directors) stand up.
Whether it is good for complex analysis I'm not sure and will have to leave
that to others to comment on.

 

CHAM's flair is HVAC specific and there is even a link with Hevacomp so if
you've done your room calculations in that then there is a reduced version
which will let you do some basic flow analysis.  

 

The problem with most of these simplified tools however tends to be the
gridding which has a tendancy to let them down and so convergence of
solutions can be hard to achieve.  It really does depend on what you are
going to use it for and what sort of problems.

 

Sorry about copying your message below to the list Kai, but I think others
will lose the thinking of the thread and my comments as well, hope you don't
mind.

Antixs, 

 

Both Airpak and Flovent are customized CFD programs for building HVAC
applications.  Airpak wraps around the basic Fluent solver, and provides a
user-interface that is much more geared towards building engineers, as well
as some additional functions that is only available with Airpak, such as
solar heat gain.  

 

I have some experience with Airpak a while ago, being a Fluent user for many
years, I did not find any problem of learning the program and will say an
engineer without prior experience should be able to pick up the modeling
pretty quickly - the problem, however, is that if there is any issue with
the model, such as if the solution is diverging, it is very difficult to
"debug" the model in Airpak.  I assume the same would be for Flovent, so in
essence I would say they provide the easiness in "cookie-cutter"
applications. 

 

I am not copying this to the entire mailing list, as I may be talking a bit
too specific. 

 

 

Regards,

Kai

Thanks for such detailed information! They are really helpful. Do you have

I think this depends largely on your budget and proficiency.

 

If you want to go full on with CFD, then I'd suggest Fluent
(http://www.fluent.com/) everyday.  It is very widely used and well trusted
tool.  ICEM is a good meshing tool, but we like Pointwise and Gridgen for
it's meshing simplicity.

 

Other than that, I know CCM+ from CD-Adapco (http://www.cd-adapco.com/) is
very good too.  Makes the job quite easy.  These tools are very expensive
though.

 

If you want the same sort of capability and are willing to use mainly text
input then I'd suggest OpenFoam (http://www.openfoam.org) - a very powerful
open source CFD tool.  You could use something like pointwise to mesh it,
output a fluent case file and then openfoam has it's own fluent case file
converter program which you could use to then convert it and process it.
You'd probably need a decent post processor too, but clearly then you are
only paying for those programs as openfoam itself
is free.    If you can do it all by text then you wouldn't need to pay
anything at all.  It will require you to use Linux though.  I saw a
pre-compiled bootable live CD distro of this recently which was quite
impressive so it allows you to check it out just by inserting CD into
computer and booting to it.  The link for that is:
http://www.caelinux.com/CMS/

 

 

Of the cheaper and possibly more usable programs for quick built environment
analysis.  Cham Pheonics (http://www.cham.co.uk/)  is good value for money.
It's Flair add on is pretty simple to use.  I'd still personally get a good
CAD program to make sure your geometry is spot on before importing it, but
then it would do the job well.  A lot of companies use it becasue of it's
relative simplicity and good price.

 

Another which is aimed at non-CFD experts is DesignBuilder CFD
(http://www.designbuilder.co.uk/).  It is in beta test stage and looks
promising.  It'll be great for simple stuff.  Wouln't recommend anything
that uses just cartesian grids for complex jobs, but for the large majority
of jobs it will suit, especially if it's internal room flows, etc.  Should
be quite competitive on the price too.

 

Hope that helps.

Not a great deal of difference as far as I know.  My friend at Buro Happold

I'm a gambit fan, nice and easy to use and means you are in control of what
is going on with the grid, though have to say that I've used Pointwise
recently and find that is quicker as a pre-processor, but obviously an
additional cost.

I rather like those test papers you gave links too.  My research work is
referenced throughout it...lol.  Had a feeling it might have been though
seeing the person was working my own PhD supervisor.

Paul

My experience is mainly in outdoor simulation, where you have some nice

Antixs, et al

 

Airpak is okay and is perfectly adapted to HVAC applications as it includes
fan details, etc allowing you introduce swirl, etc.  It is expensive for
what you get though.  It has improved, but the gridding was fairly rough and
ready if you get complex geometry and can throw a wobbly if you are doing
external flow analysis for things like pedestrian comfort assessments where
you could need large variance in your grid cell size.  If you are doing
rooms, etc you'll be fine.  I'd agree with Kai's comments though.

 

Not used FloVent.  It's quite pretty from memory, it's outputs are well
suited to HVAC work and make the whole CFD (Colour For Directors) stand up.
Whether it is good for complex analysis I'm not sure and will have to leave
that to others to comment on.

 

CHAM's flair is HVAC specific and there is even a link with Hevacomp so if
you've done your room calculations in that then there is a reduced version
which will let you do some basic flow analysis.  

 

The problem with most of these simplified tools however tends to be the
gridding which has a tendancy to let them down and so convergence of
solutions can be hard to achieve.  It really does depend on what you are
going to use it for and what sort of problems.

 

Sorry about copying your message below to the list Kai, but I think others
will lose the thinking of the thread and my comments as well, hope you don't
mind.

 

Cheers

 

Paul

Antixs, 

 

Both Airpak and Flovent are customized CFD programs for building HVAC
applications.  Airpak wraps around the basic Fluent solver, and provides a
user-interface that is much more geared towards building engineers, as well
as some additional functions that is only available with Airpak, such as
solar heat gain.  

 

I have some experience with Airpak a while ago, being a Fluent user for many
years, I did not find any problem of learning the program and will say an
engineer without prior experience should be able to pick up the modeling
pretty quickly - the problem, however, is that if there is any issue with
the model, such as if the solution is diverging, it is very difficult to
"debug" the model in Airpak.  I assume the same would be for Flovent, so in
essence I would say they provide the easiness in "cookie-cutter"
applications. 

 

I am not copying this to the entire mailing list, as I may be talking a bit
too specific. 

 

 

Regards,

Kai

Paul,
Thanks for such detailed information! They are really helpful. Do you have
any experience with Airpak and Flovent? Heard that these two tools are
specially tailored for built environment.

Thanks again.

I think this depends largely on your budget and proficiency.

 

If you want to go full on with CFD, then I'd suggest Fluent
(http://www.fluent.com/) everyday.  It is very widely used and well trusted
tool.  ICEM is a good meshing tool, but we like Pointwise and Gridgen for
it's meshing simplicity.

 

Other than that, I know CCM+ from CD-Adapco (http://www.cd-adapco.com/) is
very good too.  Makes the job quite easy.  These tools are very expensive
though.

 

If you want the same sort of capability and are willing to use mainly text
input then I'd suggest OpenFoam (http://www.openfoam.org) - a very powerful
open source CFD tool.  You could use something like pointwise to mesh it,
output a fluent case file and then openfoam has it's own fluent case file
converter program which you could use to then convert it and process it.
You'd probably need a decent post processor too, but clearly then you are
only paying for those programs as openfoam itself
is free.    If you can do it all by text then you wouldn't need to pay
anything at all.  It will require you to use Linux though.  I saw a
pre-compiled bootable live CD distro of this recently which was quite
impressive so it allows you to check it out just by inserting CD into
computer and booting to it.  The link for that is:
http://www.caelinux.com/CMS/

 

 

Of the cheaper and possibly more usable programs for quick built environment
analysis.  Cham Pheonics (http://www.cham.co.uk/)  is good value for money.
It's Flair add on is pretty simple to use.  I'd still personally get a good
CAD program to make sure your geometry is spot on before importing it, but
then it would do the job well.  A lot of companies use it becasue of it's
relative simplicity and good price.

 

Another which is aimed at non-CFD experts is DesignBuilder CFD
(http://www.designbuilder.co.uk/).  It is in beta test stage and looks
promising.  It'll be great for simple stuff.  Wouln't recommend anything
that uses just cartesian grids for complex jobs, but for the large majority
of jobs it will suit, especially if it's internal room flows, etc.  Should
be quite competitive on the price too.

 

Hope that helps.

Hi all,

 

Just wonder what CFD softwares are popularly used for analyzing built
environemnt in architect/MEP consulting firms? Also which one is relatively
eaiser to use?

Shaun,

 

Metered demand shown on ES-E report accounts for DEMAND INTERVAL which
defaults to 15 min and may be higher than hourly peak demand reported in
Plant reports such as PS-B. You'll find more details on that if you search
eQUEST help for Electric SUB-HOUR Demand Intervals.

Hi,

 

In eQuest, the PS-B report and .CSV file give the same number for electrical
demand. But a different number is on the ES-E report (slightly higher in
each case I've looked at).  May I ask why?  And, which is correct?  It
doesn't seem to be related to exterior-power which is included in the .CSV
file. 

 

Thanks,

Scot,
If you are not interested in the most accurate results, and you want to use
it during the conceptual design period in a comparative method, I think
Ecotect could be a good suggestion. The interface is great, and it is
specially designed for architects.
Except the CFD simulation other simulation such as Lighting and energy
simulation is acceptable. And you can also export the model to other
softwares, e.g. EnergyPlus, ESP-r, Radianec, etc.

Best,
Mostapha

I actually use it quite a bit and like it, but I had some very good engineering teachers.  The SketchUp tool is great, and if you just wanted to do sort of a loads analysis (not looking at the effects of different HVAC systems or controls, just those of layout, constructions, glazing, orientation, etc.), then you could do that within the SketchUp tool with "purchased air" systems.  But once you want to start putting in any HVAC, you should get someone experienced to help you.  Good luck!

JRR,
 
Yes OpenSuse is ok.  Personally I like changing my Linux flavour on a
regular basis.  Currently using Mandriva which seems ok.  I think if you
want to properly use it for commercial application then you really should
like you say go for the Novell supported version or the other flavour which
is probably just as well supported and certainly is that favoured by
Pointwise and number of other programs out there, which is RedHat Linux.
Not sure but isn't Fedora the open version of this?
 
I think CAE-linux with it all being precompiled does give the opportunity
for those not using linux the opportunity to try it and see if they like it.
Never know we might convert a few people in the process.
 
Regards
 
Paul

I think this depends largely on your budget and proficiency.
 
If you want to go full on with CFD, then I'd suggest Fluent
(http://www.fluent.com/) everyday.  It is very widely used and well trusted
tool.  ICEM is a good meshing tool, but we like Pointwise and Gridgen for
it's meshing simplicity.
 
Other than that, I know CCM+ from CD-Adapco (http://www.cd-adapco.com/) is
very good too.  Makes the job quite easy.  These tools are very expensive
though.
 
If you want the same sort of capability and are willing to use mainly text
input then I'd suggest OpenFoam (http://www.openfoam.org) - a very powerful
open source CFD tool.  You could use something like pointwise to mesh it,
output a fluent case file and then openfoam has it's own fluent case file
converter program which you could use to then convert it and process it.
You'd probably need a decent post processor too, but clearly then you are
only paying for those programs as openfoam itself is free.    If you can do
it all by text then you wouldn't need to pay anything at all.  It will
require you to use Linux though.  I saw a pre-compiled bootable live CD
distro of this recently which was quite impressive so it allows you to check
it out just by inserting CD into computer and booting to it.  The link for
that is:  http://www.caelinux.com/CMS/
 
 
Of the cheaper and possibly more usable programs for quick built environment
analysis.  Cham Pheonics (http://www.cham.co.uk/)  is good value for money.
It's Flair add on is pretty simple to use.  I'd still personally get a good
CAD program to make sure your geometry is spot on before importing it, but
then it would do the job well.  A lot of companies use it becasue of it's
relative simplicity and good price.
 
Another which is aimed at non-CFD experts is DesignBuilder CFD
(http://www.designbuilder.co.uk/).  It is in beta test stage and looks
promising.  It'll be great for simple stuff.  Wouln't recommend anything
that uses just cartesian grids for complex jobs, but for the large majority
of jobs it will suit, especially if it's internal room flows, etc.  Should
be quite competitive on the price too.
 
Hope that helps.

Hi all,
 
Just wonder what CFD softwares are popularly used for analyzing built
environemnt in architect/MEP consulting firms? Also which one is relatively
eaiser to use?
 
Many thanks.

Hello,

 

I am helping out with the planning of the student design competition for the
upcoming NESEA conference this up coming March.
(http://www.buildingenergy.nesea.org/)   I think it would be great if the
contestants in addition to designing sexy building to have the design
heating and cooling loads as part of their entry.  Can anybody recommend any
friendly software that would be forgiving for first time users and the
technically impaired?  I know that HAP puts out a basic block load
calculator but my major issue with it is that it does not take into account
the potential of shading its self as a result of complex building forms and
asking contestants to use EQuest would just be crewel.  I am looking for a
happy medium that would have the building geometry front end that Equest
that doesn't require a PE to operate.  Any help or recommendations would be
greatly appreciated.  Thanks!

How about using an input tool like the DesignBuilder or SketchUp plugin for
EnergyPlus, and then running loads with a simple HVAC system like
EnergyPlus' "purchased air"?  That would make the input (especially HVAC)
simple and also recognize shading.
 
I'm suggesting EnergyPlus tools, since those are what I'm familiar with, but
there may be similar options for other software....

IES is probably the easiest graphically driven front end simulation package
to pick up and run with straight off, but I reckon DesignBuilder would be my
choice.  It runs EnergyPlus and should be relatively easy to put something
together in a program that has an easy to use front end and has a nice
report generating tool and it's considerably cheaper than most tools of
similar standing.

Julia,

I have been a bit up in arms about how this document will apply to some of the DESs serving our client community who are perhaps a bit unique in doing things like:
- billing buildings only on peak demand (not consumption)
- generating chilled water from waste heat outside of CHP situation
- generating heat by burning some rather cheap things including garbage
 (if they get paid to take it and burn it, probably best to just count it as free and not press the luck on a negative fuel cost)

I have been assuming that the Step 2 template would have to include the proposed DES energy consumption documented in primary sources like electricity and natural gas and the corresponding costs extended from those specific consumption numbers. That could get pretty complicated for some of the above scenarios.

Your tact looks considerably simpler and could remain abstracted above my questions about detailed fuel sources and detailed utility rates.

Thank you all for your comments so far and please do share if you have a Step 2 approach reviewed.

Paul Riemer

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] District Thermal System

Let me reiterate, that I have not submitted my model yet to LEED.  So, I don't have any feedback from them regarding the validity of my take on things.

In aswer to your question: Yes and no. :)

The way I see things:

For Step 1, the DES document talks about using a "market" rate for the DES utilities.  So, my take on that is that if there is a general prevailing rate for these utilities in your area, that should be used in Step 1.  Where as the intent for Step 2 seems to be to use info (i.e. a rate or other method as discussed below) that reflects your plant's actual efficiency.

In theory, for Step 1, the rate shouldn't matter since it's effect is neutralized by using it in both the proposed and baseline models.  However, I'm thinking there may be a situation where if you have a really stellar (i.e. low CHW, steam, HW rate) or poor (i.e. high CHW, steam, or HW rate) performing proposed central plant and you use that rate in Step 1 in both the proposed and baseline models, it may impact your results in Step 1.  Although, again, in theory, it shouldn't matter.  But, as I do more models, it seems that the relationship between $ saved and the % saved is not linear - i.e. as you demonstrate more and more savings, it seems easier to get to the next LEED increment with smaller amounts of deltas - and vice versa (which to some degree makes sense since dividing by smaller numbers).  But, I'm thinking this effect could impact your savings in Step 1 and thus your ability to even get to Step 2.  But, maybe I'm off base here.  I'm speculating at this point in that regard.

That being said, it does seem that the rate you used in Step 1 could be the same rate used in Step 2 for your proposed building and thus, the performance shown for the proposed building models on the LEED templates could be the same in both Steps.

Another idea  I had was that the DES rate could be used to back calculate the overall COP/efficiency of your plant.  And then use those figures in your proposed model for Step 2.  It may be easier to adjust those rates for distribution losses etc.  All this assumes that your DES rate is based on metered data and actual production costs.  It seems LEED may want some demonstration of this.

Julia,

Thank you for your comments.  Please allow me to ask a bit more.

Are you stating that Table 1.8.2(b) at the bottom of your Step 2 EAc1 template will have an energy type line item of "hot water", "steam", or "chilled water"?  If so, will the numeric energy use value (e.g. 1,234 MBtu) be exactly the same as in Step 1's EAc1 template?  Meaning the only differences between the proposed columns of the two submittal templates will be the dollar costs of the DES energy stream and total costs?

I just finished my first DES project (not submitted yet, though) and have a couple more in the works.

I agree with the interpretations below especially with respect to Step 2 and the utilization of the DES purchased rates as an acceptable means of reflecting the prposed/actual central plant's efficiency in the proposed energy model.  Although, the DES purchased rates should reflect/be adjusted for the items Karen mentions.  Additionally, I'd recommend confirming that the DES rate includes all the central plant's bits and pieces.  The maintenance costs should also be extracted from the DES rate if possible.  (The DES document seems to clarify that the maintenance costs do not need to be included.  So, if those can be extracted that will be more of an apples to apples comparison with the baseline model and work in your proposed model's favor).

In my estimation, the above method provides the most expedient, realistic and accurate method of determining the central plant's efficiency.  The trick is that that info is not always available - especially in a campus situation.  So, in that case you may need to use one of the other methods of modeling the central plant discussed in the DES document: other metering data, modeling of the central plant equipment, etc.  However, sometimes even this data can be hard to come by and/or is not within the project's ability or budget to determine or model.  So, in that type of situation, the default central plant efficiency values provided in the DES document could be used.

I am also in the middle of a DES project at the moment.  The way that I interpreted Step 1 and 2 is as follows:

Step 1:

Baseline: all downstream (on-site) equipment, envelope components, etc, as in Appendix G.  heating and cooling is purchased from a DES system.
Proposed: all downstream (on-site) equipment, envelope components, etc, as designed.  Heating and cooling is purchased from a DES system.

Step 2:

Baseline: all equipment is modeled as on-site.  Boilers and Chillers are to be modeled as designed in Appendix G.  Utility rates are to be local utility rates
Proposed: building is to be modeled as built.  Heating and cooling is purchased from a DES system, energy costs must take into account DES production and transmission losses.

In my opinion, the vocabulary in Table 1 is confusing, but the guidelines on pages 5 and 6 seem pretty clear.  Am I on the same page as everyone else here?

Thanks,

Hello all,

I need to know the wind speed and wind direction at several heights  
close to facades of a building which is surrounded by other buildings.  
I need this info later for an indoor energy simulation. I am thinking  
of using ENVI-met for this but it is a bit complicated and requires  
many runs.
... so I have very basic questions on CFD: can a CFD simulation be run  
for a period of time or is it limited to a specific time? is it  
possible to make a simulation for one year on an hourly basis i.e.  
8760 hours with the corresponding series of wind speed and direction.  
if yes, how time-consuming will it be? What are actually the main  
inputs needed by a CFD model?
is there any useful weblink to this issue?
Thanks,
Regards,Fazia

Ryan,

 

IES has a plugin to sketchup now, so the students could build their
models in free sketchup, then use the IES sustainability toolkit to run
the likes of the 2030 challenge with annual energy consumption and
carbon emissions (taking into account building shading), loads analysis,
solar shading studies and LEED daylighting compliance for NC 2.2 credit
8.1. These are all done with one button click so very little input is
required by the user to get extremely powerful and informative outputs. 

 

It's something you can download from the website if you wish to trial
it. www.iesve.com

Hello,

 

I am helping out with the planning of the student design competition for
the upcoming NESEA conference this up coming March.  (
http://www.buildingenergy.nesea.org/)   I think it would be great if the
contestants in addition to designing sexy building to have the design
heating and cooling loads as part of their entry.  Can anybody recommend
any friendly software that would be forgiving for first time users and
the technically impaired?  I know that HAP puts out a basic block load
calculator but my major issue with it is that it does not take into
account the potential of shading its self as a result of complex
building forms and asking contestants to use EQuest would just be
crewel.  I am looking for a happy medium that would have the building
geometry front end that Equest that doesn't require a PE to operate.
Any help or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Hot Deck Schedule
Message-ID: <632601.51905.qm@web58105.mail.re3.yahoo.com>

Hi eQuest Folks,
?
I model a PIU sysem with VAV box. I added a gas furnace for morning warm-up and tried to use hot deck schedule to control the temperature of heating supply air such as 80F. From 1-7 am, hot deck T is 80. For the rest of the day, it is zero because?I want to turn off gas furnace.??In the INP file, the parameters are as follow. 
?
SET-DEFAULT FOR SYSTEM????????? 
?? TYPE = PIU
?? HEAT-SET-SCH???? = "Gas Furnace"
?? HEAT-CONTROL???? = SCHEDULED
?
However, after checking the hourly report, i found the heating coil (gas furnace) is always on even the hot deck temperature in the Gas Furnace schedule has been set to zero. Does anyone have any ideas about?what the problem is? Your feedback and sugggestions are highly appreciated.
?
Thanks
?
Shaojie

Hi Ryan,

For taking shading and building geometry into account, first time users can
work with:

1) For smaller buildings: HEED (http://mackintosh.aud.ucla.edu/heed/).
2) For analysis of the climate, they can work with Climate Consultant (
http://www2.aud.ucla.edu/energy-design-tools/)

However, for excellent graphics and complex geometry / bigger buildings,
initial users should be working on Ecotect (http://ecotect.com/). This
powerful software has now become free for students as Autodesk has recently
acquired it.

For detailed analysis, students can use: IES-VE (
http://www.iesve.com/content/). This software is quite powerful. The only
drawbacks are:
1) It can be daunting for first time users
2) It is not free for students. I recently paid $ 100 for it as a student
myself.

The use of such energy analysis software programs is becoming increasingly
mandatory in all design competitions and in the real world as well,
including code compliance. The expectation from students can be pretty high
with respect to them, quite often more than practitioners, as these are
being increasingly emphasized in architecture and engineering schools. An
example of such an initiative is at the University of Southern California
where the School of Architecture has signed up for the Architecture 2010
Imperative (http://architecture2030.org/2010_imperative/index.html) and the
students are being vigorously trained in energy efficient and passive design
strategies.


Thanks,

Anupam

Brian,
?
Thanks for your reply. The Heating availability schedule controls both the central?gas furance and zone electric reheat. However,?I?don't them to run?at the same time. The gas furnace is on?in the morning warm-up mode when the zone reheat is?off.?For the rest of the day,?the zone reheat is on when the gas furnace is off. The HEAT-SET-SCH?is supposed to control the gas?furnace. But I didn't figure how it works or maybe there?are some other parameters with higher priorities. 
?
Best,
?
Shaojie??

Perhaps the Heating availability schedule:


HEATING-SCHEDULE
Takes the U-name of a SCHEDULE of TYPE = ON/OFF/TEMP that specifies when heating is available from the system. If not entered, the program will assume that heating is always available when needed. A zero value for this schedule means that heating is not available. A non-zero value indicates that heating is available.The program interprets a value greater than 1.0 to be the outside temperature above which heating is unavailable. The program assumes the heating coils are off whenever the air-handling fans are off.-- or try setting the HEAT-SET-SCH to something like 55F rather than 0F.

Not sure.

Hi eQuest Folks,
?
I model a PIU sysem with VAV box. I added a gas furnace for morning warm-up and tried to use hot deck schedule to control the temperature of heating supply air such as 80F. From 1-7 am, hot deck T is 80. For the rest of the day, it is zero because?I want to turn off gas furnace.??In the INP file, the parameters are as follow. 
?
SET-DEFAULT FOR SYSTEM????????? 
?? TYPE = PIU
?? HEAT-SET-SCH???? = "Gas Furnace"
?? HEAT-CONTROL???? = SCHEDULED
?
However, after checking the hourly report, i found the heating coil (gas furnace) is always on even the hot deck temperature in the Gas Furnace schedule has been set to zero. Does anyone have any ideas about?what the problem is? Your feedback and sugggestions are highly appreciated.
?
Thanks

Dear List folk,
I recall a post that might have occurred about two - four months ago, in
which someone mentioned a film or membrane that was applied to the pitched
portion of an attic roof.  The film had radiation blocking properties or
something like that (I wasn't interested at the time).
 
If my memory is correct, will someone point me toward that post or a source
which describes that product?
 
Thanks in advance.

Let me reiterate, that I have not submitted my model yet to LEED.  So, I
don't have any feedback from them regarding the validity of my take on
things. 
 
In aswer to your question: Yes and no. :)
 
The way I see things:
 
For Step 1, the DES document talks about using a "market" rate for the DES
utilities.  So, my take on that is that if there is a general prevailing
rate for these utilities in your area, that should be used in Step 1.  Where
as the intent for Step 2 seems to be to use info (i.e. a rate or other
method as discussed below) that reflects your plant's actual efficiency.  
 
In theory, for Step 1, the rate shouldn't matter since it's effect is
neutralized by using it in both the proposed and baseline models.  However,
I'm thinking there may be a situation where if you have a really stellar
(i.e. low CHW, steam, HW rate) or poor (i.e. high CHW, steam, or HW rate)
performing proposed central plant and you use that rate in Step 1 in both
the proposed and baseline models, it may impact your results in Step 1.
Although, again, in theory, it shouldn't matter.  But, as I do more models,
it seems that the relationship between $ saved and the % saved is not linear
- i.e. as you demonstrate more and more savings, it seems easier to get to
the next LEED increment with smaller amounts of deltas - and vice versa
(which to some degree makes sense since dividing by smaller numbers).  But,
I'm thinking this effect could impact your savings in Step 1 and thus your
ability to even get to Step 2.  But, maybe I'm off base here.  I'm
speculating at this point in that regard.
 
That being said, it does seem that the rate you used in Step 1 could be the
same rate used in Step 2 for your proposed building and thus, the
performance shown for the proposed building models on the LEED templates
could be the same in both Steps. 
 
Another idea  I had was that the DES rate could be used to back calculate
the overall COP/efficiency of your plant.  And then use those figures in
your proposed model for Step 2.  It may be easier to adjust those rates for
distribution losses etc.  All this assumes that your DES rate is based on
metered data and actual production costs.  It seems LEED may want some
demonstration of this.

Julia,
 
Thank you for your comments.  Please allow me to ask a bit more.
 
Are you stating that Table 1.8.2(b) at the bottom of your Step 2 EAc1
template will have an energy type line item of "hot water", "steam", or
"chilled water"?  If so, will the numeric energy use value (e.g. 1,234 MBtu)
be exactly the same as in Step 1's EAc1 template?  Meaning the only
differences between the proposed columns of the two submittal templates will
be the dollar costs of the DES energy stream and total costs?
 
Paul Riemer

I just finished my first DES project (not submitted yet, though) and have a
couple more in the works.  
 
I agree with the interpretations below especially with respect to Step 2 and
the utilization of the DES purchased rates as an acceptable means of
reflecting the prposed/actual central plant's efficiency in the proposed
energy model.  Although, the DES purchased rates should reflect/be adjusted
for the items Karen mentions.  Additionally, I'd recommend confirming that
the DES rate includes all the central plant's bits and pieces.  The
maintenance costs should also be extracted from the DES rate if possible.
(The DES document seems to clarify that the maintenance costs do not need to
be included.  So, if those can be extracted that will be more of an apples
to apples comparison with the baseline model and work in your proposed
model's favor).  
 
In my estimation, the above method provides the most expedient, realistic
and accurate method of determining the central plant's efficiency.  The
trick is that that info is not always available - especially in a campus
situation.  So, in that case you may need to use one of the other methods of
modeling the central plant discussed in the DES document: other metering
data, modeling of the central plant equipment, etc.  However, sometimes even
this data can be hard to come by and/or is not within the project's ability
or budget to determine or model.  So, in that type of situation, the default
central plant efficiency values provided in the DES document could be used.

I am also in the middle of a DES project at the moment.  The way that I
interpreted Step 1 and 2 is as follows:

Step 1:

Baseline: all downstream (on-site) equipment, envelope components, etc, as
in Appendix G.  heating and cooling is purchased from a DES system.
Proposed: all downstream (on-site) equipment, envelope components, etc, as
designed.  Heating and cooling is purchased from a DES system.

Step 2:

Baseline: all equipment is modeled as on-site.  Boilers and Chillers are to
be modeled as designed in Appendix G.  Utility rates are to be local utility
rates
Proposed: building is to be modeled as built.  Heating and cooling is
purchased from a DES system, energy costs must take into account DES
production and transmission losses.

In my opinion, the vocabulary in Table 1 is confusing, but the guidelines on
pages 5 and 6 seem pretty clear.  Am I on the same page as everyone else
here?

Thanks,

Karen

Message-ID: <48CE9FD7.8C26.007B.0@auseea.com>

My building model has 3.9% energy savings, but 24.6% savings in energy cost because of heating demand. 
The structure is approximately 1 cent per kWh and $12 per kW.  All the heating savings, saves on peak demand and therefore saves more money then energy.  Since LEED is based on energy cost, is it safe to assume that the my building will achieve the 5 points?  Has anyone run across this situation.

Message-ID: <3D2DE15E12A62F49BEF3A442AD47F12D028A645304@exchange.corporate.engineeringinc.org>

I have a building that is predominantly VAV with UFAD using a boiler/chiller plant.  However, one portion of the building is residential which we would like to use WLHP's for.  I would like to use purchased hot water (geothermal at 110 deg from City) and the chilled water from the building plant to maintain the WLHP Loop between 60 and 90 deg.

Any ideas on how to model this?

Also, I've been a bit confused on how eQuest uses PVVT systems to represent the air-side of WLHP systems.  Any references or resources anyone has that explains the theory behind this would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

While it is not common, sometimes depending on the utility rate structure
and/or mechanical systems this does happen.  For example, the 1 Bryant Park
(Bank of America) building while it received many LEED EA credits (and a
LEED platinum rating) did not really save that much if any in total energy
use.  The reason for this was its use of an ice storage system which shaves
off the peak demand and moves it to off-peak times such as during the
night.  As long as the utility rates and model were built correctly, I would
rest assured that your results are accurate.

This indeed could be possible.  However, I would be careful and question
why you have such a peak demand.  For instance if the peak demand only
occurs for 2-5 minutes and the rest of the day you average 20-40% off
your peak you might have a schedule problem (i.e. fans, pumps, heating
coils, all turn on at the same time).  Otherwise if your peak demand is
pretty consistent with the actual load heating load this is entirely
possible.

Message-ID: <476418.28636.qm@web50804.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Hi Paul,
Hmmm.? Those situations do?sound complex and tricky.? I've only had to deal "plain vanilla" central plants at this point.?

My thought/comment would be that it seems valid to use a simple cost for the chw or hw ($/therm etc.) in the DES step 2 models in lieu of modeling?a central plant?IF???that cost is?truly reflective of the central plant's efficiency.

In the cases you describe below, it sounds like there may be a disconnect between cost and efficiency.? Sounds like you would need to?model a central plant in?Step 2 that is reflective of the central plants efficiency.? You could?ignore any unusual methods (burnt trash?etc) in the model.??Then?you could?calc the dollar savings by hand afterward and deduct that?via the exceptional calc or renewable energy savings on the EA cr 1 template.? This seems like it would meet?the requirement to reflect the actual efficiency of?your central plant but still give you credit for the dollar savings?associated with burnt trash or other energy saving or renewable measures.

Before you go through a lot of work though, it may be worth your time?doing a CIR or calling LEED to determine an acceptable approach.

Julia,
?
I have been a bit?up in arms about how this document will apply to?some?of the?DESs?serving our client community who are?perhaps?a bit unique in doing things like:
- billing buildings only on?peak demand (not?consumption)
- generating chilled water from waste heat outside of CHP situation
- generating heat?by burning some rather cheap things including garbage
?(if they get paid to take it and burn it,?probably best to just count it as free and not press the luck on?a negative fuel cost) 
?
I have been assuming that the Step 2 template would have to include the proposed DES energy consumption documented in?primary sources like electricity and natural gas and the corresponding costs extended from those specific consumption numbers.?That could?get?pretty complicated?for some of the above scenarios.
?
Your tact looks considerably simpler and could remain abstracted?above my?questions about detailed fuel sources and detailed utility rates.
?
Thank you all for your comments so far and please do share if you?have a Step 2 approach reviewed.

Let me reiterate, that?I have not submitted my model yet to LEED.? So, I don't have any feedback from them regarding the?validity of my take on things. 

In aswer to your question: Yes and no. :)

The way I see things:

For?Step 1, the DES document talks about using a "market" rate for the DES utilities.? So, my take on that is that if there is a general prevailing rate for these utilities in your area, that should be used in Step 1.? Where as the intent for Step 2?seems to be to use info (i.e. a rate or other method as discussed below) that reflects your plant's actual efficiency.? 

In theory, for Step 1, the rate shouldn't matter since?it's effect is neutralized by using it in both the proposed and baseline models.? However, I'm thinking there may be a situation where if you have a really?stellar?(i.e. low CHW, steam, HW rate) or poor (i.e. high CHW, steam, or HW rate) performing proposed central plant and you use that rate in Step 1 in both the proposed and baseline models, it may impact your results in Step 1.??Although, again, in theory, it shouldn't matter.? But, as I do more?models,?it seems that the?relationship between $ saved and the % saved is not?linear - i.e.?as you demonstrate more and more savings, it seems easier to get to the next LEED increment with smaller amounts of deltas -?and vice versa?(which to some degree makes sense since dividing by smaller numbers).??But, I'm thinking?this effect could impact your savings in Step 1 and thus your ability to even get to Step 2.? But, maybe I'm off base
 here.? I'm speculating at this point in that regard.

That being said, it does seem?that the rate you used in Step 1 could be the same rate used in Step 2 for your proposed building and thus, the performance shown?for the proposed building models on the LEED templates?could be the same in both Steps.?

Another idea??I had was that the?DES rate could be used to back calculate the overall COP/efficiency of your plant.? And then use those figures in your proposed model for Step 2.? It may be easier to adjust those rates for distribution losses etc.? All this assumes that your DES rate is based on metered data?and actual production costs.? It seems LEED?may want some demonstration of this.??

Julia,
?
Thank you for your comments.? Please allow me to ask a bit more.
?
Are you stating that?Table 1.8.2(b) at the bottom of your Step 2 EAc1 template?will have?an energy type line item of "hot water", "steam", or "chilled water"?? If so, will the numeric energy use value (e.g. 1,234 MBtu) be exactly the same as in Step 1's EAc1 template?? Meaning the only differences between the proposed columns?of the two submittal templates will be the?dollar costs of the DES energy stream and total costs?
?

I just finished my first DES project (not submitted yet, though)?and have a couple more in the works.??

I agree with the interpretations below especially with respect to Step 2 and the utilization of the DES purchased rates?as an acceptable means of reflecting the prposed/actual central plant's efficiency in the proposed energy model.??Although, the DES purchased rates should reflect/be adjusted?for the?items Karen mentions.? Additionally,?I'd recommend confirming that the?DES rate includes all the?central plant's bits and pieces.??The maintenance costs should also be extracted from the DES rate if possible.? (The DES document seems?to clarify that the maintenance costs do not need to be included.? So, if those can be extracted that will be more of an apples to apples comparison with the baseline model and work in your proposed model's favor).? 

In my estimation, the above method provides the most expedient, realistic?and accurate method of determining the central plant's efficiency.? The trick is that that info is not always available - especially in a campus situation.? So, in that case you may need to use one of the other methods of modeling the central plant discussed in the DES document: other metering data, modeling of the central plant equipment, etc.? However,?sometimes even this data can?be hard to come by and/or is not within the project's ability or budget to determine or model.? So, in that type of situation, the?default central plant efficiency values provided in the DES document could be used.?

I am also in the middle of a DES project at the moment.? The way that I interpreted Step 1 and 2 is as follows:

Step 1:

Baseline: all downstream (on-site) equipment, envelope components, etc, as in Appendix G.? heating and cooling is purchased from a DES system.
Proposed: all downstream (on-site) equipment, envelope components, etc, as designed.? Heating and cooling is purchased from a DES system.

Step 2:

Baseline: all equipment is modeled as on-site.? Boilers and Chillers are to be modeled as designed in Appendix G.? Utility rates are to be local utility rates
Proposed: building is to be modeled as built.? Heating and cooling is purchased from a DES system, energy costs must take into account DES production and transmission losses.

In my opinion, the vocabulary in Table 1 is confusing, but the guidelines on pages 5 and 6 seem pretty clear.? Am I on the same page as everyone else here?

Thanks,

I am trying to simulate an electric heating (only) system for a residential
high rise building using eQuest.  My SS-F reports are showing an obscene
amount of hours underheated for my zones and the type of system I'm using
(radiant slab).  This system doesn't allow me to turn on electric baseboards
at the zone level.

I'm guessing that my underheated hours are stemming from not having any sort
of forced-air system/ventilation input for these spaces.  Does anyone have
any suggestions on how I could get these underheated hours reduced with the
system I'm using, or should I switch to another system to simulate all
electric heating in my residential zones?

Hi all,

I wonder if any of you can have the experience with modeling water source
heat pump system in eQuest. I had read the DOE-2.2 manual, but still feel a
little confused. I would like to model a VAV system with hot water reheat
for humidity control. The hot water is provided by a water source heat pump
system which uses the building return chilled water for water source. Can
this type of system be modeled in eQuest?

Thanks for your help.

Dan:
 
For your simulation, I think you can model it as a typical boiler and cooling tower system and then convert the heat rejection and heat addition loads of WLHP loop to the required energy use of the hot and cold water if you know the efficiency of the heat exchanger that isolates the WLHP loop from the hot/cold water. It may be a bit more challenging if you want to couple the chilled water system with the WLHP system. My initial thought is that you can create a dummy zone that is cooled by the chilled water system and has the internal load identical with the heat rejection load of the WLHP. You may have to run the simulation twice and manually input the internal load to the dummy zone. Why don't you use cooling tower to cool the WLHP water? Cooling tower should be cheaper to run than the chiller.
 
Regarding eQUEST using PVVT to represent air-side of WLHP (water-to-air heat pump), the reason is PVVT has more flexibility to model packaged DX coil unit. By specifying stages of cooling and heating capacity, minimum airflow ratio, and applying proper performance curves, PVVT can model either conventional heat pump with single stage compressor and constant speed fan, or more advanced heat pump with two-stage  compressor and variable speed fan. In addition, with PVVT, you can simulate a DOAS that heats and/or cools the OA with a water-to-air heat pump after OA is preconditioned with ERV.
 
Hope it helps,

I would like to use purchased hot water (geothermal at 110 deg from City) and the chilled water from the building plant to maintain the WLHP Loop between 60 and 90 deg.  

 

Any ideas on how to model this?

My understanding is that if you assign multiple zones to a PVVT, it is
modeled as a single central water-cooled DX cooling/heating coil serving
multiple zones.  One zone is designated as the control zone and the
central coil is controlled based on its thermostat.  

 

According to the DOE2.2 help file:  

"The airflow to all other zones is proportionate to the airflow of the
control zone. In other words, the thermostats in the non-control zones
have no effect on either airflow or supply air temperature.  They may,
however, modulate a reheat coil or baseboard."  

 

Thus, there may be times where there is simultaneous cooling and heating
for some zones. The only way to have one compressor per zone is to
assign each zone to its own SYSTEM.

 

For the HP system type, when multiple zones are assigned to a single
SYSTEM, each zone is modeled as having its own compressor and DX
heating/cooling coil.  This eliminates simultaneous heating and cooling.


 

This is all based on my review of the DOE2.2 help file.  If anyone has a
different experience, I would appreciate hearing about it.

 

Thanks,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Loop-to-Loop Heat Pump?
Message-ID: <4cdff77f0809182247k3f84cfaeld1b2bfcb3258a91a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am seeking advice on how to model the following system in eQuest. Any
inputs are appreciated.

The primary system consists of several electric chillers, which supply
chilled water to cooling coils for space cooling. Because this building is
located in hot and humid climate, water-to-water heat pump is used to supply
hot water, which is used for coil reheat for the purpose of humidity control
and domestic hot water. The water-to-water heat pump uses the return chilled
water as heat source, thus reducing the energy consumption of the chillers.

Can this system be modeled in eQuest? I tried loop-to-loop heat pump system
in eQuest, but realized that the loop-to-loop heat pump system can only use
lake/well as heat resource (is this correct?), and I could not figure out a
way to couple the return chilled water loop with the heat pump system.

Thanks so much.

Ashley

Doug:
 
You made a good point regarding the zoning of PVVT system. In fact, when simulate a WLHP or GSHP system, eQUEST will assign PVVT system to each zone. So that, the temperature and/or humidity of each zone can be individually controlled by the assigned PVVT system. In addition, heat recovery between zones with simultaneous heating an cooling needs can be accounted for in the WLHP/GSHP loop temperature calculation.
 
In the Design Development wizard of eQUEST, user can select zoning method for PVVT from the four options: System per Zone; System per Floor; System per Shell; and System per Site. However, it is recommended to use "System per Zone" for simulating WLHP or GSHP system (which uses multiple water-to-air heat pumps to independently cool/heat each individual zone and recover heat among zones when simultaneous heating and cooling occurs among the conditioned zones). Using other zoning method, may result in under cooled/under heated hours due to the reason explained by Doug in his following message.

Subject: RE: [Bldg-sim] WLHP Loop with Chilled Water and Geothermal WaterSources



My understanding is that if you assign multiple zones to a PVVT, it is modeled as a single central water-cooled DX cooling/heating coil serving multiple zones.  One zone is designated as the control zone and the central coil is controlled based on its thermostat.  

 

According to the DOE2.2 help file:  

"The airflow to all other zones is proportionate to the airflow of the control zone. In other words, the thermostats in the non-control zones have no effect on either airflow or supply air temperature.  They may, however, modulate a reheat coil or baseboard."  

 

Thus, there may be times where there is simultaneous cooling and heating for some zones. The only way to have one compressor per zone is to assign each zone to its own SYSTEM.

 

For the HP system type, when multiple zones are assigned to a single SYSTEM, each zone is modeled as having its own compressor and DX heating/cooling coil.  This eliminates simultaneous heating and cooling.  

 

This is all based on my review of the DOE2.2 help file.  If anyone has a different experience, I would appreciate hearing about it.

 

Thanks,

Doug Maddox

Dan:

 

For your simulation, I think you can model it as a typical boiler and cooling tower system and then convert the heat rejection and heat addition loads of WLHP loop to the required energy use of the hot and cold water if you know the efficiency of the heat exchanger that isolates the WLHP loop from the hot/cold water. It may be a bit more challenging if you want to couple the chilled water system with the WLHP system. My initial thought is that you can create a dummy zone that is cooled by the chilled water system and has the internal load identical with the heat rejection load of the WLHP. You may have to run the simulation twice and manually input the internal load to the dummy zone. Why don't you use cooling tower to cool the WLHP water? Cooling tower should be cheaper to run than the chiller.

 

Regarding eQUEST using PVVT to represent air-side of WLHP (water-to-air heat pump), the reason is PVVT has more flexibility to model packaged DX coil unit. By specifying stages of cooling and heating capacity, minimum airflow ratio, and applying proper performance curves, PVVT can model either conventional heat pump with single stage compressor and constant speed fan, or more advanced heat pump with two-stage  compressor and variable speed fan. In addition, with PVVT, you can simulate a DOAS that heats and/or cools the OA with a water-to-air heat pump after OA is preconditioned with ERV.

 

Hope it helps,

 

Xiaobing

I have a building that is predominantly VAV with UFAD using a boiler/chiller plant.  However, one portion of the building is residential which we would like to use WLHP's for.  I would like to use purchased hot water (geothermal at 110 deg from City) and the chilled water from the building plant to maintain the WLHP Loop between 60 and 90 deg.  

 

Any ideas on how to model this?

 

Also, I've been a bit confused on how eQuest uses PVVT systems to represent the air-side of WLHP systems.  Any references or resources anyone has that explains the theory behind this would be greatly appreciated.

 

Thanks,

Hi,
Chapter 31 (Fenestration) of Ashrae handbook fundamentals has average
overall U-values for different frame types (weighted average for a frane of
2.5" I believe, which also includes the glassedge effect). Accurate U-values
need to be calculated using NFRC standards, using approved software (in the
US this is LBNL Windows and Therm).

I am not aware of a visible light transmittance requirement, but the lower
the transmittance, the less daylighting benefits you will get, as you know,
so there are no energy benefits for having a low Vt. Glass manufacturers
work hard to keep light transmittances high and SHGC low.

Hope this helps
Kind regards,
Karen

Greetings,

I have not had any real experience using logic statements in eQUEST and
am wondering if there is anyone out there proficient in using such
techniques in their model developments.  I have seen the 'User-Defined
Default Expression' option where logic commands can be entered, but have
not been able to figure out good uses for this tool.  I have seen how it
can be useful in making building parameters interdependent, but this is
often not needed in the model I construct.

I would appreciate it if someone could share a good document (or
information otherwise) that would have some examples with applicable
language for the user-defined default expression.

Related to this, is it possible to systematically change certain defined
values (LPD, infiltration, etc...) by a factor to create new defined
values?  

Thanks in advance,

Actually - when you install eQUEST it should put an XL file in your
\eQUEST\Window folder titled eQUEST-DOE2 Glass Library.xls

 

This has the DOE2 glass types sorted by SHGC and U-Value. Under U-value
there are numbers for COG, as well as assembly U-Values. 

 

Of course ultimately it depends on the size of the glass lite. For
example if you have a 10' x 10' opening, and you break it into 3 rows
and 3 columns, your U value will be higher than if you break it into 2
rows and one column.

Josh,

You could probably use ASHRAE fundamentals Handbook to get the assembly
U-values. Go to Fenestration (or 29th Chapter) and look for Table 5
(U-factors for Various Fenestration products) this is from an older

I'm trying to do a feasibility study for a Multi Family Mixed-Use
residential project. Is ASHRAE 90.1 the governing  code for this, or
should I be using ASHRAE 90.2?

You would use 90.1.  It falls under the scope listed in section 2.3(a) of
90.1-2004, and states that this codes applies to any multi-family structures
with more than 3 stories above grade.

Hello Fazia,

CFD is a method where the domain is separated in small cells. This means that it gives a far more detailed picture, but as the spacial resolution becomes smaller, the time scale becomes smaller as well. In theory, there is no restriction on the total length of the simulation, but in practice the calculation time becomes very large. For example, I made a time dependent CFD simulation of an operating room last week. The simulated time was 15 minutes, but it took 4 days to calculate. This means your one-year simulation probably will not finish in your lifetime. 

One solution for this problem is to use steady state simulations for some typical situations to get a feeling for the variation that you will encounter.

Good luck!

Kind regards,
Wiebe Zoon

Hello all,

I need to know the wind speed and wind direction at several heights close to facades of a building which is surrounded by other buildings.  
I need this info later for an indoor energy simulation. I am thinking of using ENVI-met for this but it is a bit complicated and requires many runs.
... so I have very basic questions on CFD: can a CFD simulation be run for a period of time or is it limited to a specific time? is it possible to make a simulation for one year on an hourly basis i.e.  
8760 hours with the corresponding series of wind speed and direction.  
if yes, how time-consuming will it be? What are actually the main inputs needed by a CFD model?
is there any useful weblink to this issue?
Thanks,
Regards,Fazia

Try a 4-pipe induction unit. I believe that can have primary and
secondary coils. Ignore that you can't model the fan coil fan. It is
insignificant. 

I used to do this to model a guest room fan coil with supply and exhaust
air to the guest room. Don't do every room. Do building facing
directions.

Subject: [Equest-users] FCU with outside air fan

Hi All,
I am trying to model a residential unit served by a Fan coil unit (FCU).
It has a separate outside air fan and exhaust fan operating 24/7. The
fan coil unit is available to operate for all hours but should operate
intermittently depending on the room load.

I tried modeling this by selecting a 4-pipe FCU and specified the
exhaust and outside air at the thermal zone level. I made the FCU to
operate intermittently by making the "Fan on mode" to be intermittent.
By doing this, what I observed in the hourly report was:
1. FCU unit cycles intermittently as intended.
2. Exhaust fan operates continuously (24/7) (with the specified cfm) as
intended.
3. However, the outside air cycles per the FCU. 
*If the FCU is off, then OA cfm is zero
*If FCU supply air cfm < the OSA cfm specified at the zone level, then
hourly OSA cfm matches the FCU supply air cfm *If FCU supply air cfm >
the OSA cfm specified at the zone level, then hourly OSA cfm matches the
cfm specified at the zone level.

As mentioned before, I want my outside air to operate continuously with
constant flow-rate. Can anyone suggest me a way to model this system?

Thanks in advance for your help!
Regards,
Yuvaraj

I have noticed this too.  The constant volume exhaust fan merely means that
the fan runs constantly, but may not draw air through the space (read the
help file on this, it's more eloquent than I am).

What I have done to remedy this issue using other system types is specify
that the system fan operates as a variable volume fan, with the fan curve
being linear.  This will allow the fan to modulate down to the required
exhaust airflow.  If you look at the help files for "SUPPLY-KW/FLOW" it
shows the fan curves for variable speed fans, cycling fans, discharge, etc.
So this is the way that the program models cycling fans already, and you can
use it to your advantage with the exhaust airflow piece.

Hope this works!

Sorry about this request being off topic.

I'm working on a project related to the process of chilled 
water plant design and an trying to find out if anyone has 
ever put together a flowchart of the HVAC design process. 
More specifically, a flowchart of the design process a 
mechanical engineer would go through in designing a chilled 
water system for a building. I'm not talking about the 
actual diagram that lays out the components but rather the 
decision making steps an engineer would go through. An 
example of one box in the flowchart might be "does the load 
vary enough to justify multiple chillers? yes or no."

Thanks

Jason

I'm trying to do a feasibility study for a Multi Family Mixed-Use

should I be using ASHRAE 90.2?

You would use 90.1.  It falls under the scope listed in section 2.3(a) of
90.1-2004, and states that this codes applies to any multi-family structures
with more than 3 stories above grade.

Does anyone have any rules of thumb on a quick/easy approximation for
taking a Center-of-Glass U-value and converting it to an Assembly
U-value based on industry standard assembly constructions?  I know this
depends on a lot of variables, like frame material and conductance, and
the size of the overall glass assembly, etc., but I'm just looking for a
quick estimate on performance reduction for comparisons to other window
types for a particular building.



Also, is there an ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Baseline glass Visible Light

Hello Fazia,

CFD is a method where the domain is separated in small cells. This means that it gives a far more detailed picture, but as the spacial resolution becomes smaller, the time scale becomes smaller as well. In theory, there is no restriction on the total length of the simulation, but in practice the calculation time becomes very large. For example, I made a time dependent CFD simulation of an operating room last week. The simulated time was 15 minutes, but it took 4 days to calculate. This means your one-year simulation probably will not finish in your lifetime. 

One solution for this problem is to use steady state simulations for some typical situations to get a feeling for the variation that you will encounter.

Good luck!

Kind regards,
Wiebe Zoon

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] CFD Software for Built Environment

Hello all,

I need to know the wind speed and wind direction at several heights close to facades of a building which is surrounded by other buildings.  
I need this info later for an indoor energy simulation. I am thinking of using ENVI-met for this but it is a bit complicated and requires many runs.
... so I have very basic questions on CFD: can a CFD simulation be run for a period of time or is it limited to a specific time? is it possible to make a simulation for one year on an hourly basis i.e.  
8760 hours with the corresponding series of wind speed and direction..  
if yes, how time-consuming will it be? What are actually the main inputs needed by a CFD model?
is there any useful weblink to this issue?
Thanks,
Regards,Fazia

Try a 4-pipe induction unit. I believe that can have primary and
secondary coils. Ignore that you can't model the fan coil fan. It is
insignificant. 

I used to do this to model a guest room fan coil with supply and exhaust
air to the guest room. Don't do every room. Do building facing
directions.

Hi All,
I am trying to model a residential unit served by a Fan coil unit (FCU).
It has a separate outside air fan and exhaust fan operating 24/7. The
fan coil unit is available to operate for all hours but should operate
intermittently depending on the room load.

I tried modeling this by selecting a 4-pipe FCU and specified the
exhaust and outside air at the thermal zone level. I made the FCU to
operate intermittently by making the "Fan on mode" to be intermittent.
By doing this, what I observed in the hourly report was:
1. FCU unit cycles intermittently as intended.
2. Exhaust fan operates continuously (24/7) (with the specified cfm) as
intended.
3. However, the outside air cycles per the FCU. 
*If the FCU is off, then OA cfm is zero
*If FCU supply air cfm < the OSA cfm specified at the zone level, then
hourly OSA cfm matches the FCU supply air cfm *If FCU supply air cfm >
the OSA cfm specified at the zone level, then hourly OSA cfm matches the
cfm specified at the zone level.

As mentioned before, I want my outside air to operate continuously with
constant flow-rate. Can anyone suggest me a way to model this system?

Thanks in advance for your help!

Yuvaraj

I have noticed this too.  The constant volume exhaust fan merely means that
the fan runs constantly, but may not draw air through the space (read the
help file on this, it's more eloquent than I am).

What I have done to remedy this issue using other system types is specify
that the system fan operates as a variable volume fan, with the fan curve
being linear.  This will allow the fan to modulate down to the required
exhaust airflow.  If you look at the help files for "SUPPLY-KW/FLOW" it
shows the fan curves for variable speed fans, cycling fans, discharge, etc.
So this is the way that the program models cycling fans already, and you can
use it to your advantage with the exhaust airflow piece.

Hope this works!

ever put together a flowchart of the HVAC design process. 
More specifically, a flowchart of the design process a 
mechanical engineer would go through in designing a chilled 
water system for a building. I'm not talking about the 
actual diagram that lays out the components but rather the 
decision making steps an engineer would go through. An 
example of one box in the flowchart might be "does the load 
vary enough to justify multiple chillers? yes or no."

Thanks

Jason

DOE2.2 might do it. Equest is the interface for it.

Message-ID: <141D50E6B1F9E247BD450DA0BB288FE103619C4A@l-aexc01.global.arup.com>

Hi All,
Does anyone know how to make a FCU cycle ON/OFF based on the zone
thermostat setting? I tried choosing the "Fan on mode" to be
intermittent in the Fan->Flow parameters tab. When I make the fan to be
intermittent, fan is cycling but the supply CFM is no more a constant
volume. It is varying the supply CFM. I observed this in the hourly
report.

ASHRAE standard 90.1 requires the fan to cycle to meet the loads during
unoccupied hours. How everybody model this in eQuest when you have a FCU
system?

Any suggestions is greatly appreciated.

HI folks - 

Anyone  have any luck with responses from LEED/USGBC - So painful- No
call backs, no response to emails - server is painfully slow - for no
incentives 

BOY what do you get ?  - how can you sell this to a client is cost way
too much and what do you get a plaque - how about putting that money 

Into PV or more insulation or design - lets get real here - I do
understand their roll in the game BUT-

Yuvaraj,

I believe the "intermittent" mode is the correct way to model this.

When you look at the hourly reports it appears that the fan coil is varying the airflow rate.  However, I believe eQuest is calculating the percentage of the hour that the FCU operates and then calculates an average airflow during that entire hour.  Say the FCU has a constant volume airflow capacity of 500 CFM, but during one hour it only cycles on for a third of the hour.  I believe eQuest would then report this airflow as 166 CFM for that hour in the hourly report.

Hope this helps.

If you disagree please let me know.

Sincerely,

Mark Prince

This question is about setting the efficiency of the budget case 
domestic hot water heater for modelling purposes.  In 90.1-2004, 
Section 11.3.2 (b) is states "All HVAC and service water heating 
equipment in the budget building shall be modeled at the minimum 
efficiency levels, both part load and full load, in accordance with 
6.4 and 7.4.

7.4 refers to Table 7.8.  A small gas heated storage tank has an 
efficiency of 0.62-0.0019V EF.  Where EF is the energy factor.  From 
what I can find there is no single formula to convert EF to thermal 
efficiency.  So what would you model the budget case efficiency at in 
DOE2.1e for this example?

Thanks for any insight you can give.

I believe a cycling type of fan shuts off when the space temperature falls below the Throttling Range you assign for the particular mode (Heating or Cooling) you are in. For example, a cooling thermostat of 72?F and a throttling range of 4?F yields a high limit of 74?F and a low limit of 70?F.  When you fall within this range, I believe the fan should shut off (if you choose the Fan Intermittent mode).There should be no airflow.
 
But now I am unsure if ALL SYSTEMS allow fan cycling..I believe you can with a fan coil.
 
The other responder is correct in that eQuest deals in hourly chunks, and a fan may only be on part of an hour, thus a lower CFM, but in reality, the same CFM for only part of the hour.

Hello All,

I used eQuest 3.61b to modify a file created from eQuest 3.61. I am trying to open this modified file in eQuet 3.6 again and I get the following error.

Does anyone have any prior experience with this?

 

Any help very much appreciated.

Mark,
I don't disagree with you. You may be right. But is there any
documentation which says it is how equest reports the supply air
flow-rate?

Other thing is, I am having a continously operating exhasut fan and
outside air fan (24/7) and intermittently operating FCU. Attached is the
hourly report. In this case I have a 100 cfm exhaust and outside air. If
you are right then I dont understand how the ratio of OSA/supply air
flow-rate is reported. Can you give me your insights?

Regards,
Yuvaraj

Yuvaraj,

I believe the "intermittent" mode is the correct way to model this.

When you look at the hourly reports it appears that the fan coil is
varying the airflow rate.  However, I believe eQuest is calculating the
percentage of the hour that the FCU operates and then calculates an
average airflow during that entire hour.  Say the FCU has a constant
volume airflow capacity of 500 CFM, but during one hour it only cycles
on for a third of the hour.  I believe eQuest would then report this
airflow as 166 CFM for that hour in the hourly report.

Hope this helps.

If you disagree please let me know.

Sincerely,

Hi All,
Does anyone know how to make a FCU cycle ON/OFF based on the zone
thermostat setting? I tried choosing the "Fan on mode" to be
intermittent in the Fan->Flow parameters tab. When I make the fan to be
intermittent, fan is cycling but the supply CFM is no more a constant
volume. It is varying the supply CFM. I observed this in the hourly
report.

ASHRAE standard 90.1 requires the fan to cycle to meet the loads during
unoccupied hours. How everybody model this in eQuest when you have a FCU
system?

Any suggestions is greatly appreciated.

Regards,
Yuvaraj

Yuvaraj,

I'm unaware of any documentation that would support my theory.  This is just my gut feeling.

As for your hourly report, I believe the OA/SA ratio is being reported as 100 CFM divided by whatever the average hourly flow was.  Anytime the average hourly flow is less than 100 CFM it simply reports it as 100%.  The odd thing is that any hour the FCU doesn't cycle it reports the ratio at 90.9%.  ????????  I can not explain this.

Something that does concern me is that it may appear that eQuest is only modeling the 100 cfm of ventilation/exhaust air when the FCU is cycling.  If you want to make sure your results are accurate I would suggest doing the following:

1.)  Serve the zone with the FCU only.  The FCU will take care of cooling/heating load in the zone.

2.)  Find a dummy zone (unconditioned zone) within your energy model and constantly ventilate/exhaust that zone with the 100 CFM.  Be sure to use some wide t-stat ranges so you don't have any unmet heating/cooling load hours and don't waste any energy on reheat.

By separating the FCU from the ventilation, in this way, your energy calculation should be pretty accurate.  Granted, the 100 CFM of ventilation air is probably helping cool your zone some, but I'm guessing from your hourly report that the ventilation is shutting down when the FCU shuts down.  This should be more accurate.

Hope this helps.

Sincerely,

Josh,
 
I have had some luck using the pre-defined values in the tables people
mention.  The problem is that the ratio of frame area to total window area
is so variable that I don't think there is a good rule of thumb to use. 
 
Here is some data based on some recent modeling projects.
 
large curtain wall and store front systems have between 5-25% frame area
punch-out windows have between 18-40% frame area (lower percentage for
fixed, higher for operable)
 
You can see that there is a wide range which could significantly impact the
accuracy of an energy model.  In my opinion, not accounting for window frame
area properly can lead to dubious energy modeling results, especially if
you're doing comparisons between different glazing choices.

Does anyone have any rules of thumb on a quick/easy approximation for taking
a Center-of-Glass U-value and converting it to an Assembly U-value based on
industry standard assembly constructions?  I know this depends on a lot of
variables, like frame material and conductance, and the size of the overall
glass assembly, etc., but I'm just looking for a quick estimate on
performance reduction for comparisons to other window types for a particular
building.

 

Also, is there an ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Baseline glass Visible Light

In my experience, there is no descending compatibility between 3.61 and

You'll probably need to reverse back to 3.61.

Hello Shruti,

 

I quickly checked into opening eQuest files in previous versions and I found
a similar error.  What I did to remedy the problem was simply remove the
strings of text that were causing the error. 

 

*I can tell you what I did but I am open to other suggestions from the
board.*

 

The *.pd2 file that your error refers to is a text file and you can open it
in any text editor.

1.       Make a backup copy of the *.pd2 file.

2.       Open the file in a text editor

3.       Find row number 24 (as your error message refers to)

a.       It should look like the following text:.

 

   ProjTreeType[1] = 1

   ProjTreeID[1] = 10040000

   ProjTreeLabel[1] = "Site Data"

 

b.       It seems that the newer versions of eQuest use this "projecttree"
notation and the previous version do not.

4.       Therefore,  delete these rows of text and save the file.

5.       Try to reload the file in the previous version and it should load.

 

If this doesn't work you will still have your backup file you made in step
one.  Good luck and tell me if this helps.

In my experience, there is no descending compatibility between 3.61 and 3.6.


You'll probably need to reverse back to 3.61.

Hello All,

I used eQuest 3.61b to modify a file created from eQuest 3.61. I am trying
to open this modified file in eQuet 3.6 again and I get the following error.

Does anyone have any prior experience with this?

 

Any help very much appreciated.

Thanks, Shruti

Hi Rob,
You should be able to get the electricity rates from the following
website. But you should know Spanish to interpret the rate structures.

The following is a message I composed a little while ago addressing this 
topic for another user -
-------------------
There is no simple 1-2-3 method to convert files from a newer version of 
eQUEST to be run in an older one because the critical question is - what 
properties or symbol selections are written to the PD2 file that are 
valid for the later version but not in the earlier version. There may be 
no errors, or there may be many.
v3.61e was distributed back around 5/07, and a lot has happened since 
then (though mostly behind the scenes and related to DEER measure analysis).
Working through all the errors and getting to a point where the project 
loads without any errors will NOT necessarily result in the same 
simulation results, and may in fact not even enable the simulation to 
run w/out further edits. With this in mind, you really need to think 
twice about rolling back to an earlier version for any project.

If you DO decide that you need to open a newer version project into an 
earlier release...
There are two levels of errors that you may need to contend with - 
Wizard/project (.pd2) incompatibilities and DOE-2 (.inp) incompatibilities.

You will be alerted to the PD2 errors first.
Simply trying to open the project file into your v3.61e will likely 
result in an error message something like this:
Error Reading File C:\...\<project name>.pd2
Line Number: 39
Column Number: 19
File Format Error

What you need to do is open the .PD2 file up into a text file editor 
that reports line/row & column info and see what is written to the PD2 
file in this location. In the project file that posted the above error, 
line #38 contains:
BDBUpdateReEval = 1
This was a new property added back in 2/08 to facilitate more detailed 
project backward compatibility processing. This item could just get 
deleted from the PD2, since the property itself is not recognizable in 
the earlier release.
Once this line is deleted, you can try to load it again and will likely 
get other errors further down in the PD2. In most cases you need to 
simply delete those lines and re-open, etc.

Once the PD2 errors are bypassed, the INP will get loaded and you may 
find that the new INP contains keywords not supported in the earlier 
version. Same iterative method can be used to resolve those errors...

That's the best advice I can offer on this topic.

Hello,
?
I selected a packaged DX unit for my building with gas furnace?and?tried to use keywords?HOUR (IHR)?and if then to control the zone reheat temperature such as 0 for morning warm-up period. It seems like that eQUEST doesn?t recognize this keyword even I found It in DOE2 help file.?What I am doing actually is to use a criteria to turn on/off the zone heaters. Does anyone?know how to find?the keywords used by eQUEST such as HOUR? 
?
Any light on this issure are highly apprecitated.

Mike-

I've done various things using with logic statements in eQuest but usually
find that they create more problems then they solve.  Simple logic
statements work fine but when I create long statements they seem to get cut
off and corrupt my .inp file.  Does anyone else share this opinion? I'm
curious to see if complex logic statements can be incorporated without
errors.  For example, I've created scripts that pull Occupancy, Heat Gain,
LPD, and EPD values based on the schedules assigned to the spaces.  They
usually work first time but once I re-open my model it becomes corrupted. I
think this has something to do with DOE2/eQuest only being able to read a
certain amount of characters per line.  Any thoughts?

Message-ID: <48e28554.062a400a.7143.6c04@mx.google.com>

Hi!   I?m fairly new to eQuest (and building energy too) and I?ve been using
eQuest for a short period of time now, and I?m pretty

decent in using it.  However, I have no means to verify my simulation
results to find out if my modeling assumptions, and the way I use eQuest

are correct.  I mainly use eQuest t find out HVAC cooling requirements for
specific projects, for example, a friend of mine recently bought a house

and consider to install a HVAC system.  I verified the proper tonnage (or
BTU/Hr) and came with a pretty good answer, but unless he buy the HVAC

unit and install it, there is no real way to find out if my results are
correct.  Does anybody have a example project with results that I can trust
??

Also maybe a tutorial with complete exercises and answers?

 

Thanks!!

 

Thank you and have a nice day! :)

Steve,

 

Yes, you can only use 80 characters on a DOE2 BDL line. You'll either
need to break up your logic conditions or try using shorter variable
names.

Greetings,

I have not had any real experience using logic statements in eQUEST and

not been able to figure out good uses for this tool.  I have seen how it
can be useful in making building parameters interdependent, but this is
often not needed in the model I construct.

I would appreciate it if someone could share a good document (or

Related to this, is it possible to systematically change certain defined

Xiaobing,

 

This is pretty simply done with a few formulas and PivotTables in Excel.  My
tool, ECAM (available at
http://www.cacx.org/resources/rcxtools/spreadsheet_tools.html) organizes
things to make this very easy.

Hi, all:

 

I remember seeing a post on this list about a year ago that mentioned a
spreadsheet tool to generate 52 X 7 daily schedules from 8760 hourly data.
Is it still available anywhere? 


Thanks,

 

Xiaobing

Louis-Phillippe:
 
Utility bills and metering is the only way you ever really verify eQuest results.
 
Other than 400 sqft/ton or 400 cfm of supply air/ton.
 
And it will always depend on the climate you are in, the orientation of the building, the mix of zone types, and too many factors to list here.
 
What kind of building are you looking at?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] eQuest tutorial



Hi!   I'm fairly new to eQuest (and building energy too) and I've been using eQuest for a short period of time now, and I'm pretty

decent in using it.  However, I have no means to verify my simulation results to find out if my modeling assumptions, and the way I use eQuest

are correct.  I mainly use eQuest t find out HVAC cooling requirements for specific projects, for example, a friend of mine recently bought a house

and consider to install a HVAC system.  I verified the proper tonnage (or BTU/Hr) and came with a pretty good answer, but unless he buy the HVAC

unit and install it, there is no real way to find out if my results are correct.  Does anybody have a example project with results that I can trust ??

Also maybe a tutorial with complete exercises and answers?

 

Thanks!!

 

Thank you and have a nice day! :)

I've been beating my head against the wall trying to figure this out.  The attached inp and pd2 file are the 90.1 baseline for a model which works.  I have many many unmet heating hours.  The ctrls options were not changed between my design and the baseline, only the system type.  Can someone with more equest experience help me?
