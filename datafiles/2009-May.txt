It seems to me that credit should be taken for shading from adjacent
buildings.  The base case procedure takes pains to normalize the baseline
analysis to a building that is neutral to solar gain and there have been
requirements in the past (and still are?) that the building cannot
self-shade itself.  Other Bldg-sim readers probably can provide a more of
official reading of the actual rules and I am interested in hearing their
rationales.

Hi All,

 

I assume that neither ASHRAE 90.1 ECB or Appendix G allow you to take credit
for shading due to surrounding buildings.  Can anyone provide a specific
reference to the code or LEED Reference Guide where that is stated?  I
understand the rationale for a single building, but if I'm working on a
campus with single ownership and the buildings have a 30 year contract to be
owned and operated, I feel like I should be allowed to take a credit for
reducing the solar heat gains due to adjacent buildings.  Any thoughts?

 

Thanks,

Vacancy sensors are a great idea and I would like to hear more about any
actual studies that quantify typical diversity reductions.  When performing
energy audits, we regularly encounter people who prefer low ambient light.
Standard occupancy sensors would be a real drag for these folks!

 

Here's a great source of lighting study white papers, including a good
analysis of the differences between ASHRAE 90.1-2007 and IECC 2006 w 07
Supplement:  http://www.aboutlightingcontrols.org/education/index.shtml.  

 

For Massachusetts readers, please be aware that the 7th edition of 780 CMR
that was released in September 2008 was superseded by a more restrictive
code in October 2008 that uses the previously mentioned standards.  This was
a recent surprise to us as well as others I've spoken with who need to be
aware of code minutiae.  Here's the link to the new code:
http://www.mass.gov/Eeops/docs/dps/inf/780_cmr_13.00_energy_efficiency.pdf
(bonus - the wonky formatting makes it an interesting read).  Interestingly,
the basic requirements of LEED EA Pr 1 appear to be required to get one's
Certificate of Occupancy (MA specific addendum to section 104.5).

Appendix G is pretty clear that self-shading in the baseline case is not
permitted.  For whatever reason I seem to remember seeing something
similar about shading from adjacent buildings.  I have heard from
mechanical consultants that they never factor in adjacent building when
sizing equipment since they can't foresee what will happen to them in
the future.  But for a campus setting, where the owner has a commitment
not to tear the buildings down, maybe you can argue otherwise.
 
I'd love to hear some thoughts from the veterans here.  
 
Thanks,
Luka

Message-ID: <49FE493D.3050800@cox.net>

Hi;

I'm working up a solar DHW system for a high rise apartment building 
with roughly 550 units.
The collectors have to be on the roof, and the mechanical room is on the 
roof.
This limits the weight of tankage , etc., so I'm trying an "on the fly"  
design where the solar
tempers the service entrance water and the building riser return as 
available.

The trick to providing the maximum amount of heat is to figure out how 
much heat
has to be stored mid-day in Summer without boiling the service tank.
I got hourly hot water demand data from

"Domestic hot Water System Modeling for the design of Energy Efficient 
Systems"
Joe Wiehagen, Jeannie Leggett Sikora, NAHB, 2002.

This document was very helpful, presenting  a low use case and a high 
use case, but it
did NOT provide statistical support for the low and high cases...  That 
is are they 3 Sigma
cases??  2 Sigma cases?? What's the standard deviation of the HW demand ??

I talked to the local water authority and their observations are that 
much larger short term
transient spikes of water use occur in cold water supply compared to hot 
water supply.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Infiltration & PRM
Message-ID: <49FE8EB9.0661.0093.0@archenergy.com>

Anyone;
I'm looking for verification of "official" treatment of infiltration in
PRM models or other baseline/comparison method definitions. I can't find
air leakage or infiltration mentioned specifically in App G, Chapter 11,
or related sections of the UM, generally meaning these should be the
same in both (low, except in public entry areas, assuming mandatory
provisions are met and perform). A perusal of LEED 2.2 EAc1 section in
the ref guide was not fruitful. T24 and an old CIR contained the only
specific references I could find. Am I missing anything? ASHRAE
interpretations? LEED 2.1 ref guide EAc1 "protocol?" The Canadian
MNECB/CBIP? 
 
Thanks for any insight;
Fred W. Porter
AEC
 
Title 24
Modeling Rules for Proposed Design:
Infiltration shall either be modeled as "ON" or "OFF", for each zone,
according to the
following:
? "OFF" if fans are ON and zone supply air quantity (including transfer
air) is
greater than zone exhaust air quantity.
? "ON" if fans are OFF.
When infiltration is "ON", the reference method calculates the
infiltration rate as
0.038 cfm per square foot of gross exterior partition (walls and
windows) area for the
zone. 

Modeling Rules for Standard Design
(All):
ACMs shall model infiltration for the standard design exactly the same
as the
proposed design.
 
CIRs
 7/9/2007 -  Ruling
This CIR seeks to use reduced infiltration rates from a superior
building envelope as a variable in the energy cost budget calculation
for optimizing energy efficiency. 

The ASHRAE modeling protocol does not allow the infiltration rate to be
changed between the budget and the design case. The CIR ruling of
3/11/2003 for EAc1.2 provides some guidelines on how a case might be
made for advanced air sealing. The methodology proposed for this project
does not address all the issues raised in that ruling and would be
insufficient to grant an exception to the modeling protocol.
 
 3/11/2003 -  Ruling
Advanced air sealing is a strategy that can lead to measurable energy
savings, particularly in cold climates. Although this measure is outside
the scope of ASHRAE 90.1 modeling protocol, you may be able to make a
case for the significance of this strategy in improving energy
performance. However, this will require clear and thorough documentation
in order to be considered under the requirements of this credit. 

The following guidelines are provided to help strengthen your approach:


(1) Provide manufacturer's air leakage test results that use the same
testing protocol as that by which ASHRAE identified the baseline for
window air leakage. 

(2) Use a typical infiltration rate as a baseline, and reduce it by the
amount of improvement you can document or estimate from the air sealing
strategies employed. Do not use zero infiltration in the model, as this
is not a realistic assumption. A zero infiltration strategy would
over-emphasize the percentage of overall energy use reduction
represented by infiltration improvements. 

(3) Include required fresh air ventilation rates (per ASHRAE 62) in
both the proposed and baseline model results. 

(4) Provide clear documentation of air sealing strategies and blower
door test results, corrected for wind and temperature effects, to
clarify anticipated air sealing performance. 

(5) Provide documentation which clarifies the percentage of energy
savings attributed to the air sealing strategy, as opposed to other
energy performance measures incorporated into the building.

So, Dear Leen:

It seems that the most suitable coupled softwares are TRNSYS for indoor
simulations with TRNFLOW or COMIS for outdoor simulations.   
But what about different plants effects; should TRNFLOW/COMIS or ESP-r stand for
the air-plant-soil system? I.e. water content in the soil and hence
evapotranspiration ...etc? or should i use the 'equation writer' for entering
such needed equations? If yes what about the validity and the compatability
with the whole TRNFLOW or COMIS model?

Excuse me Leen for the many questions.

Best regards,
Mohamad.

Mohamad,
I am not sure what to recommend in the case of ESP-r but in the case of 
TRNSYS, I would recommend writing (or contracting someone to write for 
you) a model of the air/soil/plant and coupling it to the rest of your 
simulation. Such new models (Types) can be written in Fortran or C++ and 
can be integrated into the standard package relatively easily if you 
have an appropriate compiler. Some years ago, we worked on an energy 
simulation of a greenhouse and were provided (I believe) with some 
algorithms for evapotransipration from the plants. It was a hydroponic 
facility so we didn't need to worry about soil but I imagine that 
algorithms exist there as well.
Kind regards,
David

Hi,
?
I try to model WLHP and find there are two options?(single/multi-zone?and simplified single zone)?in the SD wizard if I pick water loop as heat pump source.?The two models give me different annual energy?costs.?If I choose the?simplified single zone model, there are no cooling or heating sources under the air-side HVAC system tab. I am not sure what else makes the results different besides the heating/cooling performance curves and system types. Any suggestions are highly appreciated.

Have you had a look at the example files? Try 

SolarCollectorFlatPlateWater.idf

See if that helps you at all or look at the other in the

Also, there is another mailing list/forum dedicated to Energyplus

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modeling Solar Collectors - Energy Plus

Hi;

I'm working up a solar DHW system for a high rise apartment building 
with roughly 550 units.
The collectors have to be on the roof, and the mechanical room is on the

roof.
This limits the weight of tankage , etc., so I'm trying an "on the fly"

design where the solar
tempers the service entrance water and the building riser return as 
available.

The trick to providing the maximum amount of heat is to figure out how 
much heat
has to be stored mid-day in Summer without boiling the service tank.  A 
first pass at
sizing the components and adjusting the layout can be done using one day

from each
month and a spreadsheet.

A detailed design for the "On the Fly" tempering seems to call for a 
full 8760 hourly simulation.
Has anyone out there used Energy Plus to model solar collectors as if 
they were a structure??
It shouldn't be too hard, I just need to trick E+ a few places.
Any comments // ideas ??
thanks.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] GenOpt 3.0.0 optimization program released
Message-ID: <49FF6DC2.90109@lbl.gov>

Dear Building Simulation Colleagues,

We are pleased to announce the release of GenOpt 3.0.0.

GenOpt is an optimization program for the minimization of a cost 
function, such as annual energy use. The cost function can be computed 
using any simulation program with text-based input and output, such as 
EnergyPlus, TRNSYS, IDA, DOE-2 or ESP-r. GenOpt can also be used to 
automate parametric studies.

GenOpt 3.0.0 will run multiple simulations in parallel. Depending on the 
number of processors that your computer has, GenOpt may start multiple 
simulations simultaneously in order to reduce the computing time for an 
optimization or a parametric study.

For free download and more information, please visit
http://SimulationResearch.lbl.gov/GO

Your sincerely,

Michael Wetter

Mohamad,

my main concern is that you are going to end up with an extremely difficult
model: modelling in such detail both the indoor and outdoor environment is
not straightforward. You can do it, but what is the purpose?
Is there no way to simplify part of the model? Like the humidity level in
the soil. Except for the highest layers, it will probably remain almost
constant. Also the thermal conductivity of the soil, it will change with
depth due to changes in the material composing the different layers in the
soil, but as the temperature in the lower layers will not vary that much,
the conductivity could be assumed constant.
TRNFLOW or COMIS could be used for fluid flows such as air flows (the
outdoor air and the internal air flows). I would either do what David
suggest, i.e. writing a type especially suited for your purpose, or start
with something simple. Use correlations from literature on the effect of
soil and assume the wind-profile a given input. You can refine all that
afterwards.

Shaojie:

The difference between (single/multi-zone and simplified single zone) is actually the default type of air-side HVAC system used for simulating the air-side part of a water source heat pump unit. When "single/multi-zone" is selected, the default air-side HVAC system is PVVT; When "simplified single zone" is selected, the default air-side HVAC system is "Water Loop HP". When PVVT is used, it is capable of either serving one single zone or multi-zones with one water source heat pump unit. On the other hand, each "Water Loop HP" can only serve one single zone.

In most case, the difference in the simulation results is due to the different performance curves used for the two air-side HVAC systems. The cooling performance curves for  "Water Loop HP" are normalized (approximately) at 86F entering water temperature and 67F entering indoor wetbulb, while the heating  performance curves are normalized at 68F entering water temperature and 70F entering indoor drybulb, which is the ARI rating conditions for "Water Loop Heat Pump Application" of a water source heat pump unit. However, the cooling performance curves for "PVVT" are normalized at 77F entering water temperature and 67F entering indoor wetbulb, while the heating  performance curves are normalized at 32F entering water temperature and 70F entering indoor drybulb, which is the ARI rating condition for "Ground Loop Heat Pump Application" of a water source heat pump unit. Unfortunately, in current version of eQUEST, the default EIRs for cooling and heating are the same for both PVVT and "Water Loop HP". As a result, user has to check and modify the default EIRs (and capacities if it is specified by user)with the heat pump performance data at conditions consistent with the normalization points of the performance curves (with adjustment for fan power if it is calculated separately).

As an alternative, user can load all the consistent performance curves and data (e.g. EIRs and condenser pressure drop) by selecting heat pump from heat pump library, which is an add-on feature of eQUEST and can be download at http://www.climatemaster.com/index/equest for free after registration.

I also noticed that, if the "location set" is specified as "California (Title 24)" in eQUEST wizard when creating the simulation, an air-side economizer is added to the water source heat pump simulated with the PVVT system, but not for the "Water Loop HP". (It does not happen when "All eQUEST Locations" is selected for "location set". In this case, there is no air-side economizer for both PVVT and "Water Loop HP". ) It appears a bug and should be fixed. The easiest way to remove the air-side economizer from PVVT is to set the input entry of "Outside Air Control" to "Fixed Fraction" for all the heat pump units simulated with PVVT.

Sorry for the inconvenience, I believe these issues will be addressed in the new release of eQUEST.

Regards,

Xiaobing

Hi,

I try to model WLHP and find there are two options (single/multi-zone and simplified single zone) in the SD wizard if I pick water loop as heat pump source. The two models give me different annual energy costs. If I choose the simplified single zone model, there are no cooling or heating sources under the air-side HVAC system tab. I am not sure what else makes the results different besides the heating/cooling performance curves and system types. Any suggestions are highly appreciated.


Thanks,

Shaojie

Message-ID: <057EF46662FE994F8119F0A903BCD0F82AFBE350A9@eml1.dunham.corp>

Fellow Modelers,
I would greatly appreciate any answers and comments on formulating a submission and/or CIR.

I am working on a LEED project which is heated by steam from a coal fired plant and is subject to the USGBC's District Thermal Energy document https://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=4176.
Should the baseline hot water boiler plant in the Step 2 analysis be:
A) a coal fired boiler with the proposed boiler efficiency since 90.1 does not address coal fired boilers,
B) a natural draft coal fired hot water boiler with an assumed code efficiency since 90.1 does not address coal fired boilers,
C) a natural draft gas fired hot water boiler with the code efficiency referenced in 90.1, or
D) something else?

Remember the metric is energy cost savings.

If you reread it, replacing the word 'coal' with 'trash', does your answer change?

Thank you,

Paul Riemer

Dear all,

I have an internal compiler error for a g77 compiler when trying to install
the latest release of ESP-r. The code does install smoothly on a similar
laptop with a previous Ubuntu version.

So, I thought to downgrade from Ubuntu8.10 to a previous one. However, I do
not find a lot of information to do so.

Any suggestions? Or someone who solved such an error: "g77: Internal

Xiaobing,
?
I use the same performance curves?for both models in order to?determine the effect of system types on the annual energy consumptions. ?From the hourly report, I find the heat loads are different for both models. Even if the HVAC system types are not the different, I assume that the heat loads should be?the same because the?site location, building envelope? internal loads and schedules are all?identical.?The reason for this comparison is to figure out how to?choose the correct system type (WLHP?vs. PVVT) for WLHP.?Therefore, I need to know the different between them. Thanks a lot for your sugguestion and feedback.

Sorry for the inconvenience, I believe these issues will be addressed in the new release of eQUEST.

Hi,
?
I try to model WLHP and find there are two options?(single/multi-zone?and simplified single zone)?in the SD wizard if I pick water loop as heat pump source.?The two models give me different annual energy?costs.?If I choose the?simplified single zone model, there are no cooling or heating sources under the air-side HVAC system tab. I am not sure what else makes the results different besides the heating/cooling performance curves and system types. Any suggestions are highly appreciated.

Hello Paul,
Based on my understanding the base case for Step 2 is the same as the base
case for Step 1, which would be a gas-fired, 80% efficient hot water boiler
(or two boilers depending on the size of the facility).  It seems that the
reason Step 2 exists is to see the incremental benefits and penalties
associated with using a central plant.  In your case, you also get to claim
financial benefits or penalties associated with usinig coal as the fuel
source.  Distribution losses are always penalties.

Fellow Modelers,

I would greatly appreciate any answers and comments on formulating a
submission and/or CIR.


I am working on a LEED project which is heated by steam from a coal fired
plant and is subject to the USGBC's District Thermal Energy document [LINK:
https://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=4176]
https://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=4176.

Should the baseline hot water boiler plant in the Step 2 analysis be:

A) a coal fired boiler with the proposed boiler efficiency since 90.1 does
not address coal fired boilers,

B) a natural draft coal fired hot water boiler with an assumed code
efficiency since 90.1 does not address coal fired boilers,

C) a natural draft gas fired hot water boiler with the code efficiency
referenced in 90.1, or

D) something else?


Remember the metric is energy cost savings.


If you reread it, replacing the word 'coal' with 'trash', does your answer
change?


Thank you,

This issue is probably best dealt with via email outside of the Bldg-sim list.  ESP-r is
close to a new release which will allow it to be compiled with much more recent
versions of the GNU compiler suite.  There are a number of documents which
can be forwarded about the process of building your own version of ESP-r.   Most
users report good results for Ubuntu 8.04.

To help that separate discussion out we need to find out what version of the GCC
compilers are installed on your machine.  E.g.   gcc --version    and   gfortran --version

Paul,
I would be careful about moving forward with this issue. A CIR might be
the best bet considering your different fuel source. I bet they will
tell you to use oil, which requires a greater baseline efficieny for the
boilers.

 

And Eric, in step 1, the baseline heating system is purchased heat which
is usually accomplished with a meter. There is no heating equipment
attached.  The purpose of this step is to hold the district energy
system cost neutral to show the actual building cost savings. In step 2,
you model the heating equipment as per Appendix G.

 

Sam

Energy Modelers,

I am in the detailed mode of eQuest and I would like to simulate reducing the infiltration on the exterior walls by half.  I would like to simulate this using the parametric runs feature.  Does anyone have any suggestions on how to do this?

Basically, I was hoping to create a global parameter that would incorporate the following statement:
If "Exterior Wall", then "INF-FLOW/AREA"/2, else "No change"

However, I have not had experience using the global parameter feature and tying it into a parametric run and I'm not familiar with the syntax of eQuest.

Any help or suggestions would be appreciated.

In the Step 2 model for the baseline, you DON'T use the same district
energy system used in the proposed.  Instead, you use on-site boilers of
the type specified in ASHRAE 90.1 Tables G3.1.1A and Tables G3.1.1B.

 

Interestingly enough, this is a contradiction from what is stated in
paragraph G3.1.1.1 of 90.1, but USGBC has clarified their intention in
soon to be released updates of the DES Guide.

Seth, Sam, and Eric,
Thank you for weighing in.  I should not have used the word 'plant'.  So please allow me to restate my question.
I know the Step 2 baseline boilers are on-site, but what fuel type and what efficiency?

Appendix G prohibits fuel switching and I cannot find anything in the DES guide that counters that, so on one hand I think I need the same fuel type which means options A or B.
If I chose option A, I have no savings potential and just distribution losses so no heating side reason to do Step 2.
If I chose option B, I am choosing a code efficiency for a natural draft coal/trash fired hot water boiler.  A piece of equipment so far outside the mainstream, I assert that any statement of code efficiency is arbitrary.

Appendix G also requires me to use a boiler efficiency from Ch 6, so on the other hand, I want to choose gas so I can get a code efficiency which is option C.
If I choose option C, the savings will be strongly dependent on the modeled price differential between coal/trash and natural gas.  This is the savings projects really achieve and why they use coal/trash fired district plants.

The difference between these options may well be the maximum allowed differential of 4 EAc1 points.

I eagerly anticipate any other responses and the forthcoming DES Guide.  (Did I miss the public comment period?)

To make a long story short, I vote Option A except that a portion of your proposed fuel usage will be low-cost or free trash, and the baseline will use only coal, per "Exception to G2.4" in 90.1.

Read on at your own peril...

Paul, I agree with most of what you've said.  In the definitions section of 90.1 they do include coal as a fossil fuel, so the intention of ASHRAE at least was to include coal among the fuel options.

I think you have an opportunity in the selection of the fuel source if the proposed plant is hybrid for coal and trash.  If you did have a coal/trash-fired plant, then would you be treating the trash portion as on-site "renewable" fuel source in EAC1 and EAC2?  (90.1 "Exception to G2.4") In that case you would run both models, but the trash would be free in the proposed design and the baseline would use coal alone as the standby source.  That would be your gain in overall DES plant performance.

Coal plant efficiency-wise, I think you are left with using the documented efficiency of your actual plant that you suggest in Option A, but taking credit only for the cost of the trash.  The default efficiencies presented in the DES memo don't seem to apply to baseline boilers, they rely on 90.1 for the baseline plant configuration.  If your plants were instead hybrid with natural gas and trash, then you would use Chapter 6 for plant efficiencies.

You don't mention if you think the coal plant equipment in place would be more efficient than any other coal plant.   If that isn't a point of emphasis, I would suggest taking the cost of trash and calling it a day.

Otherwise you'll need a CIR to have the USGBC approve a natural gas baseline boiler plant, but I'm not sure that the intent of the DES memo is to make a comparison against a typical boiler plant, or else the memo could have been simplified to say that.  The USGBC seems to have gone out of the way to use fuel source as specified by 90.1 rather than compare against typical.

On the other hand, maybe they are just waiting for a CIR to come through to edit the guidance...90.1 does rely on Section 6.4 for baseline plant efficiencies, assuming that a DES would use the purchased heating  method G1.1.1 which helped lead to this whole guidance memo in the first place...Good Luck!

I am working on a LEED project which is heated by steam from a coal fired plant and is subject to the USGBC's District Thermal Energy document https://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=4176.
Should the baseline hot water boiler plant in the Step 2 analysis be:
A) a coal fired boiler with the proposed boiler efficiency since 90.1 does not address coal fired boilers,
B) a natural draft coal fired hot water boiler with an assumed code efficiency since 90.1 does not address coal fired boilers,
C) a natural draft gas fired hot water boiler with the code efficiency referenced in 90.1, or
D) something else?

Remember the metric is energy cost savings.

If you reread it, replacing the word 'coal' with 'trash', does your answer change?

Thank you,

Paul Riemer

Hi Paul,

It is my understanding that LEED definitely wants you to use the actual fuel (coal) and rate for both the proposed case and the baseline case for the Step 2 model.  

I don't know what you should use for efficiency in the baseline case, though.  You are right that table 6.8.1 does not have efficiencies listed for coal.  Are there any local codes or other mechanical codes that list a minimum efficiency for a coal boiler?  Otherwise I would send in a CIR.  I searched through the existing ones quickly and did not see any questions on coal fuel.  It seems strange though, someone must have modeled a coal fueled building.

Good luck.  The district ones are tough.  I just finished one and am dreading the LEED review comments!

Hi all

I have a question in relation to the modeling of district cooling
systems which someone might be able to advise me on.

I have a campus where 4 air cooled chillers are providing cooling to a
number of buildings including my own.

There is no monitored data available for these chillers and no district
cooling utility costs as they are owned by the building users.

The LEED document on DES indicates that if the data required is not
available then a default value of COP of 4.4 can be used to calculate
the annual the energy cost including losses, pumps and maintenance etc.
This figure is based on a water cooled chiller and cooling tower
combination.

It does not make much sense to use this value as the air cooled system
is likely to be significant worse in terms of efficiency then this?

Would the correct approach in this situation be to model the 4 air
cooled chillers as a virtual plant using the either manufacturer curves,
or else the minimum efficiencies of aircooled chillers as per 90.1 and
implement the modeling rules as per Appendix G.

I would appreciate any help in regards to this matter

Thanks

All,

 

We are working on a project that has half the building running on 2-pipe
fan coils for heating only and the other half of the building on water
source heat pumps, connected to a condenser water loop.

 

There are two seperate loops, the hot water loop, which has 4 boilers,
and the condenser water loop, which has two fluid coolers. The two loops
are connected via a heat exchanger.

 

When the condenser water loop is in need of heat, it draws heat off of
the hot water loop.

 

 

Is there any way to simulate this system in eQUEST? I cannot find a way
to connect a heat exchanger between the condenser water loop and the hot
water loop.

 

Thanks,

Dana

I too would vote for Option A. I have a somewhat similar grey area
scenario:

 

In a district cooling system with electric heating ASHRAE 90.1 prior to
the DES memo would have had the baseline be district cooling with
electric heating in step 1. The DES memo document irrespective of fuel
types available on site requires the baseline to be district cooling and
fossil fuel boiler in Step 1. ASHRAE 90.1 says baseline system must be
selected based on the heating source (and floor area and building type
etc) (See G3.1.1). There is a clear conflict here and I have not found
documentation on who supersedes what.

To make a long story short, I vote Option A except that a portion of
your proposed fuel usage will be low-cost or free trash, and the
baseline will use only coal, per "Exception to G2.4" in 90.1.

 

Read on at your own peril...

 

Paul, I agree with most of what you've said.  In the definitions section
of 90.1 they do include coal as a fossil fuel, so the intention of
ASHRAE at least was to include coal among the fuel options. 

 

I think you have an opportunity in the selection of the fuel source if
the proposed plant is hybrid for coal and trash.  If you did have a
coal/trash-fired plant, then would you be treating the trash portion as
on-site "renewable" fuel source in EAC1 and EAC2?  (90.1 "Exception to
G2.4") In that case you would run both models, but the trash would be
free in the proposed design and the baseline would use coal alone as the
standby source.  That would be your gain in overall DES plant
performance.

 

Coal plant efficiency-wise, I think you are left with using the
documented efficiency of your actual plant that you suggest in Option A,
but taking credit only for the cost of the trash.  The default
efficiencies presented in the DES memo don't seem to apply to baseline
boilers, they rely on 90.1 for the baseline plant configuration.  If
your plants were instead hybrid with natural gas and trash, then you
would use Chapter 6 for plant efficiencies.

 

You don't mention if you think the coal plant equipment in place would
be more efficient than any other coal plant.   If that isn't a point of
emphasis, I would suggest taking the cost of trash and calling it a day.

 

Otherwise you'll need a CIR to have the USGBC approve a natural gas
baseline boiler plant, but I'm not sure that the intent of the DES memo
is to make a comparison against a typical boiler plant, or else the memo
could have been simplified to say that.  The USGBC seems to have gone
out of the way to use fuel source as specified by 90.1 rather than
compare against typical.

 

On the other hand, maybe they are just waiting for a CIR to come through
to edit the guidance...90.1 does rely on Section 6.4 for baseline plant
efficiencies, assuming that a DES would use the purchased heating
method G1.1.1 which helped lead to this whole guidance memo in the first
place...Good Luck!

Seth, Sam, and Eric, 

Thank you for weighing in.  I should not have used the word 'plant'.  So
please allow me to restate my question. 

I know the Step 2 baseline boilers are on-site, but what fuel type and
what efficiency?

 

Appendix G prohibits fuel switching and I cannot find anything in the
DES guide that counters that, so on one hand I think I need the same
fuel type which means options A or B.

If I chose option A, I have no savings potential and just distribution
losses so no heating side reason to do Step 2.

If I chose option B, I am choosing a code efficiency for a natural draft
coal/trash fired hot water boiler.  A piece of equipment so far outside
the mainstream, I assert that any statement of code efficiency is
arbitrary.

 

Appendix G also requires me to use a boiler efficiency from Ch 6, so on
the other hand, I want to choose gas so I can get a code efficiency
which is option C.

If I choose option C, the savings will be strongly dependent on the
modeled price differential between coal/trash and natural gas.  This is
the savings projects really achieve and why they use coal/trash fired
district plants.

 

The difference between these options may well be the maximum allowed
differential of 4 EAc1 points.

 

I eagerly anticipate any other responses and the forthcoming DES Guide.
(Did I miss the public comment period?)

In the Step 2 model for the baseline, you DON'T use the same district
energy system used in the proposed.  Instead, you use on-site boilers of
the type specified in ASHRAE 90.1 Tables G3.1.1A and Tables G3.1.1B.

 

Interestingly enough, this is a contradiction from what is stated in
paragraph G3.1.1.1 of 90.1, but USGBC has clarified their intention in
soon to be released updates of the DES Guide.

Minu, I think you should apply the DES memo only to the portions of the building that are served from the district cooling.  So if your proposed building has on-site heating (electric or otherwise), then you are only using the DES memo for the cooling related systems.

Appendix G would apply as normal to your heating system in both proposed and baseline.  Let me know if I'm not interpreting your question correctly.

David

I too would vote for Option A. I have a somewhat similar grey area scenario:

In a district cooling system with electric heating ASHRAE 90.1 prior to the DES memo would have had the baseline be district cooling with electric heating in step 1. The DES memo document irrespective of fuel types available on site requires the baseline to be district cooling and fossil fuel boiler in Step 1. ASHRAE 90.1 says baseline system must be selected based on the heating source (and floor area and building type etc) (See G3.1.1). There is a clear conflict here and I have not found documentation on who supersedes what.

To make a long story short, I vote Option A except that a portion of your proposed fuel usage will be low-cost or free trash, and the baseline will use only coal, per "Exception to G2.4" in 90.1.

Read on at your own peril...

Paul, I agree with most of what you've said.  In the definitions section of 90.1 they do include coal as a fossil fuel, so the intention of ASHRAE at least was to include coal among the fuel options.

I think you have an opportunity in the selection of the fuel source if the proposed plant is hybrid for coal and trash.  If you did have a coal/trash-fired plant, then would you be treating the trash portion as on-site "renewable" fuel source in EAC1 and EAC2?  (90.1 "Exception to G2.4") In that case you would run both models, but the trash would be free in the proposed design and the baseline would use coal alone as the standby source.  That would be your gain in overall DES plant performance.

Coal plant efficiency-wise, I think you are left with using the documented efficiency of your actual plant that you suggest in Option A, but taking credit only for the cost of the trash.  The default efficiencies presented in the DES memo don't seem to apply to baseline boilers, they rely on 90.1 for the baseline plant configuration.  If your plants were instead hybrid with natural gas and trash, then you would use Chapter 6 for plant efficiencies.

You don't mention if you think the coal plant equipment in place would be more efficient than any other coal plant.   If that isn't a point of emphasis, I would suggest taking the cost of trash and calling it a day.

Otherwise you'll need a CIR to have the USGBC approve a natural gas baseline boiler plant, but I'm not sure that the intent of the DES memo is to make a comparison against a typical boiler plant, or else the memo could have been simplified to say that.  The USGBC seems to have gone out of the way to use fuel source as specified by 90.1 rather than compare against typical.

On the other hand, maybe they are just waiting for a CIR to come through to edit the guidance...90.1 does rely on Section 6.4 for baseline plant efficiencies, assuming that a DES would use the purchased heating  method G1.1.1 which helped lead to this whole guidance memo in the first place...Good Luck!

Seth, Sam, and Eric,
Thank you for weighing in.  I should not have used the word 'plant'.  So please allow me to restate my question.
I know the Step 2 baseline boilers are on-site, but what fuel type and what efficiency?

Appendix G prohibits fuel switching and I cannot find anything in the DES guide that counters that, so on one hand I think I need the same fuel type which means options A or B.
If I chose option A, I have no savings potential and just distribution losses so no heating side reason to do Step 2.
If I chose option B, I am choosing a code efficiency for a natural draft coal/trash fired hot water boiler.  A piece of equipment so far outside the mainstream, I assert that any statement of code efficiency is arbitrary.

Appendix G also requires me to use a boiler efficiency from Ch 6, so on the other hand, I want to choose gas so I can get a code efficiency which is option C.
If I choose option C, the savings will be strongly dependent on the modeled price differential between coal/trash and natural gas.  This is the savings projects really achieve and why they use coal/trash fired district plants.

The difference between these options may well be the maximum allowed differential of 4 EAc1 points.

I eagerly anticipate any other responses and the forthcoming DES Guide.  (Did I miss the public comment period?)

In the Step 2 model for the baseline, you DON'T use the same district energy system used in the proposed.  Instead, you use on-site boilers of the type specified in ASHRAE 90.1 Tables G3.1.1A and Tables G3.1.1B.

Interestingly enough, this is a contradiction from what is stated in paragraph G3.1.1.1 of 90.1, but USGBC has clarified their intention in soon to be released updates of the DES Guide.

Fellow Modelers,
I would greatly appreciate any answers and comments on formulating a submission and/or CIR.

I am working on a LEED project which is heated by steam from a coal fired plant and is subject to the USGBC's District Thermal Energy document https://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=4176.
Should the baseline hot water boiler plant in the Step 2 analysis be:
A) a coal fired boiler with the proposed boiler efficiency since 90.1 does not address coal fired boilers,
B) a natural draft coal fired hot water boiler with an assumed code efficiency since 90.1 does not address coal fired boilers,
C) a natural draft gas fired hot water boiler with the code efficiency referenced in 90.1, or
D) something else?

Remember the metric is energy cost savings.

If you reread it, replacing the word 'coal' with 'trash', does your answer change?

Thank you,

Paul Riemer

In the US I am aware of one state that requires energy modelers to first submit a formal proposal to be considered and eventually approved to conduct energy modeling services under a contract that are used directly to calculate a financial incentive.  This state is New York.  I am curious if other states, provinces, countries, etc. involved in financial incentive programs for energy efficiency measures require such treatment for non-residential applications.  Not to be confused with outreach coordinators.

Thank you.

For people who are currently using eQUEST 3.63:

Due to structural changes in eQUEST 3.63 installation, a new version of ClimateMaster add-on (version 2.01) is needed to install the heat pump library properly for eQUEST 3.63. A beta test version of ClimateMaster add-on 2.01 is available upon request. Please e-mail me If you want a copy of it.

Have a nice weekend,

Shaojie:



The difference between (single/multi-zone and simplified single zone) is actually the default type of air-side HVAC system used for simulating the air-side part of a water source heat pump unit. When "single/multi-zone" is selected, the default air-side HVAC system is PVVT; When "simplified single zone" is selected, the default air-side HVAC system is "Water Loop HP". When PVVT is used, it is capable of either serving one single zone or multi-zones with one water source heat pump unit. On the other hand, each "Water Loop HP" can only serve one single zone.



In most case, the difference in the simulation results is due to the different performance curves used for the two air-side HVAC systems. The cooling performance curves for  "Water Loop HP" are normalized (approximately) at 86F entering water temperature and 67F entering indoor wetbulb, while the heating  performance curves are normalized at 68F entering water temperature and 70F entering indoor drybulb, which is the ARI rating conditions for "Water Loop Heat Pump Application" of a water source heat pump unit. However, the cooling performance curves for "PVVT" are normalized at 77F entering water temperature and 67F entering indoor wetbulb, while the heating  performance curves are normalized at 32F entering water temperature and 70F entering indoor drybulb, which is the ARI rating condition for "Ground Loop Heat Pump Application" of a water source heat pump unit. Unfortunately, in current version of eQUEST, the default EIRs for cooling and heating are the same for both PVVT and "Water Loop HP". As a result, user has to check and modify the default EIRs (and capacities if it is specified by user)with the heat pump performance data at conditions consistent with the normalization points of the performance curves (with adjustment for fan power if it is calculated separately).



As an alternative, user can load all the consistent performance curves and data (e.g. EIRs and condenser pressure drop) by selecting heat pump from heat pump library, which is an add-on feature of eQUEST and can be download at http://www.climatemaster.com/index/equest for free after registration.



I also noticed that, if the "location set" is specified as "California (Title 24)" in eQUEST wizard when creating the simulation, an air-side economizer is added to the water source heat pump simulated with the PVVT system, but not for the "Water Loop HP". (It does not happen when "All eQUEST Locations" is selected for "location set". In this case, there is no air-side economizer for both PVVT and "Water Loop HP". ) It appears a bug and should be fixed. The easiest way to remove the air-side economizer from PVVT is to set the input entry of "Outside Air Control" to "Fixed Fraction" for all the heat pump units simulated with PVVT.



Sorry for the inconvenience, I believe these issues will be addressed in the new release of eQUEST.



Regards,



Xiaobing

Hi,

I try to model WLHP and find there are two options (single/multi-zone and simplified single zone) in the SD wizard if I pick water loop as heat pump source. The two models give me different annual energy costs. If I choose the simplified single zone model, there are no cooling or heating sources under the air-side HVAC system tab. I am not sure what else makes the results different besides the heating/cooling performance curves and system types. Any suggestions are highly appreciated.


Thanks,

Shaojie

If the building is registered before May 2008, can we just follow the APPG
for district cooling - i.e. use the chilled water and hot water costs for
the proposed building and chiller and boiler for the baseline. Is there any
DES memo for prior to May 28 registered buildings that I am missing?

Thanks in advance.

Message-ID: <102dbb810905100532g4495f81dh119ed4779c8b1ac5@mail.gmail.com>

I have instantaneous electric hot water heaters in a building. What is the
baseline hot water heater efficiencies to use from ASHRAE 90.1 2004? The
electric heater sub-categories in table 7.8 are for 20 gallons or above. Can
I assume that the baseline water heater is centralized electric water heater
- although this is not mentioned explicitly anywhere in the writeup.

Thanks for any help in interpreting the standard.

Dear All,
I wanted a quick opinion from some of you who have worked with hotel buildings. 
Do these generally require similar heating and cooling energy? 

I was surprised to find this happening for Houston, TX, following 90.1 schedules and other protocol. I tried it with a more temprate climate but with similar results. The WWAR on the building is at 16%.

Thanks,

Kapil.

Are these numbers from the BEPS report? If you check the SS-D report,
you will probably find that the cooling is higher than heating. The
cooling in BEPS report will be 1/3-1/4th of the actual cooling load
depending on the COP of your cooling device.

Alamdari used to work at BSRIA in uk, where I also used to work... 

Also I know that they are embedded as a pull down option in IES software. 

Best to do a search on Alamdari Hammond for convection coeff

Hope this helps

Hello,

Has anyone dealt with a project that has low-voltage track lighting for an
Appendix G energy model?  Section 9.1.4 requires that the lighting power be
the wattage of the transformer that supplies the system (9.1.4(d)).  For
Appendix G, are we required to the installed lighting to include this load?

Thanks for the input,

I agree with Robby. There is no such addenda. The reason the rotation of the is because of glazing and wall orientation. ASHRAE tries to give credit to the design team for beneficial building orientation. I know and understand that in most cases the buildings footprint is dictated by the sites foot print but glazing could also be reduced on the more solar heat gaining orientation. If for instance a designer builds a building with 100% glass on the south side. It would be better to orientate the glass north because of solar heat. However, if you have an existing building you do not have to rotate it at all.

Christopher, 

  

One of the addenda to 90.1 removes this requirement and the use of addenda is accepted by USGBC, so you don't need to waste your time.

What is the original reasoning behind the ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G building rotations through 0, 90, 180 and 270 degrees? 

 

If the building is only going to have one orientation, why go through the trouble of rotating and averaging the building values when there should be only one base case?

On a sort of related topic - was there ever an addenda that allowed  
you to use the Uvalue and SC for the NORTH walls instead of the Uall  
for all orientations.  Just got called out on this for a recent  
project, but have used the North coefficients on at least 5 previous  
projects successfully... Trying to understand the LEED inconsistency.   
For that matter, why even have an entry on the EAc1 for the North  
orientation coefficients?

Addendum A states to use SHGCall for north windows and I believe this is the only prescription from Addendum A that project teams are required to follow.  You?re right, the USGBC only started enforcing that 3-4 months ago.  The U-factor has always been the fixed value as far as I know.

In LEED 2009/LEED v3 ASHRAE 90.1-2007 will be followed and project teams will once again have to model projects using SHGCnorth.

It is fascinating what aspects are evaluated under Appendix G.
Building rotation is evaluated but building form is not. Types of HVAC systems are evaluated but fuel source is not.

ASHRAE Standards, including 90.1, are public consensus documents under continuous maintenance which I think means anyone can request any change at any time.
A form for requesting changes is available on the ASHRAE Standards page at http://www.ashrae.org/technology/page/97

There are also public review draft periods for proposed standards and revisions at  https://osr.ashrae.org/default.aspx
Standard 189.1P, Standard for the Design of High-Performance Green Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings is available as a third public review draft until June 15, 2009.
The draft has some very significant aspects and I encourage engaging this review opportunity.
Motivationally,  section "7.5.3 Annual Carbon Dioxide Equivalent" extends the performance rating to CO2e emissions.
Who among us does not have an interest or opinion around that?

Message-ID: <BF1F81AEAA45B54399BF46028C53D594B07B75@sv04005.rmf.com>

Hello All,

 

The following excerpt is from LEED v2.2 "The default process energy cost
is 25% of the total energy cost for the baseline building. For buildings
where the process energy cost is less than 25% of the baseline building
energy cost, the LEED submittal must include supporting documentation
substantiating that process energy inputs are appropriate." This clearly
defines the minimum process energy cost but does it allow one to reduce
the energy cost to 25% for a building like a data center that would have
a much higher cost?

 

Thanks

As I understand it, through previous LEED Review Team comments, the 25% 
is a minimum; if it is higher than that they do not have any problems.

There is a lot of misconception with 25%  process energy. Your building
should be modeled as is if it over 25% of total energy, great you met
the threshold. If it is under 25% you should submit an explanation
describing your process load assumptions. Therefore you should ALWAYS
submit your actual loads.

Hello All,

 

The following excerpt is from LEED v2.2 "The default process energy cost
is 25% of the total energy cost for the baseline building. For buildings
where the process energy cost is less than 25% of the baseline building
energy cost, the LEED submittal must include supporting documentation
substantiating that process energy inputs are appropriate." This clearly
defines the minimum process energy cost but does it allow one to reduce
the energy cost to 25% for a building like a data center that would have
a much higher cost?

 

Thanks

Per Appendix G, Table G3.1 - 6. Lighting (b) Where a lighting system has been designed, lighting power shall be determined in accordance with  9.1.3 and 9.1.4.

Therefore, Yes. I make the interpretation that in your proposed model's case, you will need to include the specified wattage of the transformer supplying the system, as you say per (d) under section 9.1.4.

Dear All,
I wanted a quick opinion from some of you who have worked with hotel
buildings. 
Do these generally require similar heating and cooling energy? 

I was surprised to find this happening for Houston, TX, following 90.1
schedules and other protocol. I tried it with a more temprate climate
but with similar results. The WWAR on the building is at 16%.

Thanks,

Kapil.

Has anyone else found that the requirement to model upstream equipment for district cooling served buildings often times produces worse results than not including it. No doubt the obvious answer is that the district cooling equipment is probably not as good as it could be, but does anyone have a view on this? 

Typically it is out of the projects control to influence district cooling plant especially if municipalities control this equipment and require projects to hook up to it. In this sense it is not too different to taking power from local suppliers.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] eQUEST Wish List for DOE-2 Developers - Please comment
Message-ID: <19006e1d0905130656j6bc823a7x9e6bbec39caa373c@mail.gmail.com>

Hey Everyone,

I've been keeping track of a list of potential improvements to eQUEST,
and I wanted to send out a final request. Please review the list below
and email me (not the entire list) if you have anything that isn't
already included. My hope is to take this to the eQUEST developers and
try to figure out a way to either get funding for these improvements,
or be able to work with them to help develop some of these features. I
realize a list like this has been attempted many times, but I never
see a final result, so I'm giving it a shot myself! Thanks in advance
for your input.

Geometry/Zoning
1) Allow users to name their own zones in the wizards and make wall,
constructions, & layers match up with user chosen names.
2) A detailed interface zone/space editor that makes it easier to
create, modify, or delete zones or spaces (not only helps w/updating
the geometry, but for displacement ventilation too).
3) Change the Zone Snap by CAD, Polygon, or Grid in the wizard to
radio buttons instead of pulldown menus.
4) Always import the CAD file to put it near 0,0,0 or make it easier
to zoom in and out.
5) Fix issues with creating side by side shells in the wizard ? right
now, even if you try to line up the shells exactly in line with each
other, eQUEST sometimes creates an exterior wall between the shells.
This can be solved by drawing your zone boundaries slightly inside the
shell boundaries, but it would be nice to be able to indicate interior
vs exterior surfaces in the wizard.
6) Provide the option to create one roof per zone vs. one roof per
shell, regardless of whether or not you have a plenum.
7) When you build shells stacked on top of each other in the wizard,
if the shells do not have the same footprint, you end up with portions
of one shell missing exterior roofs or exterior ground floors. It
would be nice if the programs defined the exterior surfaces based on
which portions of the zone are actually exposed to exterior
conditions.
8) Better way to define double high or atrium spaces.

Envelope/Heat Transfer
1) Better accuracy/options for modeling light shelves
2) Double walled fa?ade, with options for venting
3) Trombe walls
4) Better thermal mass simulation
5) Modeling windows with input files from Window 5 (W5): This is
probably more of an issue with W5, but the file that is exported, does
not include the framing, so if you want to model the windows this way,
you need to build the actual dimensions of each window in eQUEST and
assign framing to it.
6) Night sky radiation
7) Ability to calculate radiant transfer, mean radiant temperature and
thermal comfort metrics.
8) Fix issues or provide more documentation on how to accurately
simulate roof/attic heat transfer when you have plenums. Right now, if
your plenum zones and spaces are set to type ?Plenum?, the load
reports show no heat transfer through the roof. Changing the space
type to ?Conditioned? or ?Unconditioned? seems to fix this, but it
would be nice to have documentation explaining why.

Internal Loads
1) Ability to select ballast types for lighting fixtures and have the
program include default wattages for the ballasts.

Airside Systems
1) A built in UFAD model
2) Ability to do demand control ventilation check box in wizard and
for it to apply to more system types
3) Fix issues with air to water Heat Pump models ? right now, it runs
as if the COP were 1 regardless of what EIR is input. The workaround
is to model electric resistance with the correct COP and part load
curves, but this should be fixed.
4)?Ability to directly model water-water heat pumps.
5)?Built in system type for active and passive chilled beams.
6)?Built in system type for radiant floors (heating and cooling).
7)?Ability to assign more than one system to a zone (especially useful
for modeling a dedicated outside air system).
8)?Better accuracy for modeling natural ventilation and make it
available for all system types.
9)?When modeling a dedicated outside air system (DOAS), you cannot
also have demand control control ventilation and/or and OA economizer.
Basically, the DOAS can only provide a constant amount of OA, dictated
by the zone level requirements.
10) The option to specify packaged DX EER at either design or rated conditions.
11)?The option to specify a packaged DX EER with or without fan energy
included ? then the program would subtract out fan power if that was
also entered.
12)?More transparent way of specifying VAV turndown ratios. Right now,
if you specify it in terms of Min cfm/sf, and leave Min Ratio blank,
Min Ratio automatically defaults to 1 and eQUEST takes the greater of
the two, rendering your input for Min cfm/sf a moot point.

Central Plants
1)?Water Side Economizer (plant side) - right now, this only functions
if it can provide 100% free cooling, it cannot pre-cooled water going
to the chiller. There are many semi-accurate work arounds to this, but
it would be great if the WSE could do partial cooling as well.
2)?Water to Water heat pump - right now you can only assign this to a
lake/well loop, which is a big problem.
3)?Ability to model solar hot water systems
4)?Ability to have one chiller loop provided entering chilled water
for another loop.

Parametric Runs
1) The ability to copy/paste parametric components and runs.? Right
now can be done in the .prd, but it would be nice to do it within the
eQUEST interface.
2)?Several things are missing from the parametric run pulldowns (e.g.
Tubular skylights, Lighting Control Method).
3)?The ability to create, leave out, or reassign keywords/components
in parametric runs.? This would fix at least 2 things:
- The glaring difficulty of creating 90.1 App G baselines when the
proposed design has a chiller, but the baseline has packaged cooling.
For me, this is the #1 shortcoming in eQUEST.? Encountered all the
time, tedious and error-prone every time.
- Zones could be reassigned between runs. Right now, we solve this by
abandoning eQUEST before doing parametrics and using if-then
statements in the INP and then using "case" type statements to change
them in the BDL.

User Interface
1) Fixing the spreadsheets so that they cut/paste can be used with
Excel and Word, and so that multiple selections can be more easily
edited at once.? Also the spreadsheet feature seems to lock cells when
sorted sometimes.
2) A graphical and spreadsheet format for schedules in the detailed
interface.? Would streamline a tedious process and provide output for
reports.
3) The ability to copy/paste components within the tree structure
(right now have to use a pulldown menu to find the space).
4)?Azimuth field in the Window spreadsheet so that it can be sorted by
orientation.
5)?Easier way to delete components from the component tree ? right
now, when you navigate down to what you want to delete, after its
deleted the tree reverts back to its original state, and you have to
manually navigate down to each component you want to delete.
6)?In the spreadsheet view, it would be nice to be able to copy and
paste defaults and ?restore defaults? ?for multiple selections, the
same way you can for user defined inputs.

Reports/Help Menus
1)?Updating the help menus to refer directly to eQUEST user inputs, as
well as BDL keywords.? Right now the DOE2 help will only tell you the
keyword/command, but not where to find them in eQUEST's detailed
interface.
2)?Simplify the hourly result reporting process.
3)?Create a report that includes all cooling and heating loads
(including correct roof conduction and outside air)
4)?A graphical report that shows not only end use by energy use but
also end use by energy cost
5)?Better documentation for the energy rate input.
6)?A feature to show the origin of a DOE-2 default (Title 24?? DOE2?
90.1? 62.1? Standard practice?)
7)?Better documentation on domestic hot water defaults
8)?More help documentation on dealing with eQUEST inputs at elevation
?which ones are automatically corrected by the elevation you input
under ?Site Parameters? and which ones should you account for
elevation within the inputs? The help menus only address airflow
corrections, but do not indicate is equipment efficiencies are derated
as well.
9)?More help documentation on performance curves and how to generate
the correct eQUEST inputs from part load data ? the process is
difference for chillers versus packaged DX and the help files don?t
adequately address this.

Geometry/Zoning:
In the shell component wizard screen 2 of 25 I would like to be have the
option of selecting a single slope roof not only pitched (gabled) roof.

It would also be nice if we can change the shell footprint without
loosing all window geometry

Envelop Heat Transfer:
As an architect, I would like to see an easier, more straight forward
simulation of 1)natural ventilation based on area inlet and area
outlet, and 2)Night insulation

Thank you

Nader

I've asked if these guys at wunderground could make the csv data 
available via ftp, but to no avail. Downloading 365 days of csv from the 
website page-by-page is a pain.
If anybody else has any luck, please let me know.
The other option is to webscrape the data with a bot. Far beyond my 
expertise - any web coders out there?

Hi,
Which is the last eQuest version available?
I am still using 3.61e, which is the last one I found in the web, but 
its already a long time I hear commenting on the 3.63 (and even the 3.62 
which I suppose I completly missed) as a version improving some of the 
limitations on the v 3.61e. Also I heard on the list comments about the 
fact that there was soon to be a new release (don't know if is the 3.63 
or a latter one) introducing many improvements. Is there a known 
schedule for these updated versions release as well as a list of which 
points have already been addressed on them?
Regards,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Throttling Range
Message-ID: <A9E31731F7A9C14FA1E38F98A918D11001A75BBA@peci-exch1.peci>

When reviewing the BEPU output report, the "Percent of Hours outside the
throttling range" is noted.  I have a couple of questions regarding what
this means and how to trouble shoot it:
*	What would typically be the Max hours outside the throttling
range that would be considered acceptable?  (e.g. <10%?)
*	If this value is greater than 10%, where is the next place to
look to find the source of the issue?  Is this normally due to
undersizing/oversizing a system or zone?
I'd appreciate any input on this topic!

Thanks,

Erin

Based on ASHRAE 90.1, you can only have 3.4% hours outside of the
throttling range (300 hrs) and only 50 hours difference between the
budget and proposed. 
 
In the simulation file, report SS-R Zone Performance Summary for_____
you can see what zone and how many hours are under-cooled or
under-heated. If it's just one rogue zone you can look at that
particular zone or system to see what might be the problem. Also, using
the hourly reports to see what is happening in the zone is helpful to
diagnose. 
 
good luck.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Throttling Range



When reviewing the BEPU output report, the "Percent of Hours outside the
throttling range" is noted.  I have a couple of questions regarding what
this means and how to trouble shoot it:

	*	What would typically be the Max hours outside the
throttling range that would be considered acceptable?  (e.g. <10%?) 
	*	If this value is greater than 10%, where is the next
place to look to find the source of the issue?  Is this normally due to
undersizing/oversizing a system or zone? 

I'd appreciate any input on this topic! 

Thanks, 

Erin

Message-ID: <578166.22421.qm@web58105.mail.re3.yahoo.com>

Hi,
?
I model a PSZ DX unit with gas furnace in EnergyPro. The furnace is Carrier 48PGL-24---5/ 6 in EP metal building example. The heat capacity of the furnace is less than 225000 BUTH. The AFUE of furnace is 0.82. I exported the DOE-2 input file and found the Furnace-HIR was 1.747. Does anyone know how EP converts AFUE to HIR? Any suggestions on this question are highly appreciated.
?
Best,
?

I've asked if these guys at wunderground could make the csv data

If anybody else has any luck, please let me know.
The other option is to webscrape the data with a bot. Far beyond my

The NOAA / NNDC files are monthly files and are ~1-2 months behind in
compilation (based on my subscription).  It's somewhat painful to copy, and
paste individual months into an annual file.

Also, there is no solar data in the file.

Dear users

Mr. Jason Glazer already introduced the EnergyPlus Weather Data site.

(http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/cfm/weather_data.cfm)

You can directly use the EnergyPlus to use a certain weather data.

Or* why don't you use ESP-r* which enables you to inport EnergyPlus Weather
files (*.epw) and generate a csv file from your weather data?

Message-ID: <000f01c9d4a5$357dd0a0$a07971e0$@com>

Hello eQuest Users,

I am using a parametric run to estimate savings associated with dual
enthalpy economizer versus drybulb economizer.  In the baseline run, I have
the drybulb high limit manually set to 75?F.  When I change economizer to
?dual enthalpy? in the parametric component, I would also like to reset the
drybulb high limit back to the eQuest default (which removes this input for
enthalpy economizer control).  Is there an entry that can be entered into
the parametric component that resets the value to the eQuest default?

Any insight on restoring defaults for parametric run components is welcome.

I've posted an excel spreadsheet that fetches the wunderground data for 
a specified location and date range:

http://web.mit.edu/bergey/Public/Weather%20Underground%20Query%20v11.xls

The code was written by a coworker of mine; I haven't personally

A couple of months ago I posted a "work-flow" for getting this info into 
an eQuest-usable format because I've been having some trouble. Here it 
is again, if anyone could provide guidance as to why this flow isn't 
working. And, if anyone knows if this is still applicable for eQuest 
v.3.63 I would appreciate that insight as well.

Dear Mohammed Aliyu

The very important information is at what temperature you are operating the environment to dehumidify.

Example 1.    In a very wet climate, (Angola), a large textile mill (cotton spinning frames), could not operate due to high humidity of the environment causing breakages and other problems.  They sorted the problem for a while reducing the capacity of the evaporative air conditioning and leting the temperature raise to almost 40?C.    At this temperature without removing any water from the ambiente, the resulting RH reached 45/55%.   The conditions were terrible for the personell and the whole operation had to be moved to the plateau with cooller and dryer environment.

Example 2.    To maintain 0,0% RH,  ( to be precise a dewpoint of -50?C),  in a closed small environment, with a temperature of 23?C.  The system that we specified had two big housings with silica gell.   Working in tandem, while one of the systems was dehumidifying the others was being regenerated with electric heaters.  Cooling was assured with  some DX equipment, nothing complicated. Works but expensive.

You need to calculate you sensible and latent loads.   Dividing the sensible load by the total load you get the sensible heat factor for the process.    Place your entering point in the chart and strike a line from this point in the direction of the saturation curve with the slope of the SHL.  If this line does not cross the saturation line then your process is impossible with the refrigeration alone.  You need Reheat. 

If you give me some more detail I can send you the guidelines for your project plotted on a chart.

Best regards
Eduardo Barrigana

Message-ID: <a91e48a20905141512x12e61bebwbea713d301fb23c8@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I have simulated a space with radiant slab in eQuest. The boiler supplying
hot water to the radiant floor is 87% efficient.
When I reviewed LS-D (Bldg monthly load summary) and SS-D (HVAC load
summary), I found that annual heating energy in LS-D is higher than in SS-D.
I cannot make sense of these results. This tells me that my boiler is more
efficient than 100%.

Am I reading these reports correctly? I want to find monthly loads from
envelope only (no HVAC loads). Could anyone offer thoughts, please?
Thanks much.

Hi all,
?
What is the baseline hot water heater efficiency to use from ASHRAE 90.1 2004 for instantaneous hot water heaters? The electric heater sub-categories in table 7.8 are for 20 gallons or above. Should the efficiencies be assumed the same in both proposed and baseline case?
?
Thanks a lot?for your input.

Message-ID: <767678.86098.qm@web24404.mail.ird.yahoo.com>

Hello,

I am currently using energyPlus to simulate a single zone building in hot and humid climate. The latest version of EnergyPlus has a combined heat and moisture transfer (HAMT) model added. My building envelope has polyurethane? foam as the insulating material (wall), polyethylene sheet as vapour barrier, cement screed and damp-proof barrier for floor construction.? The hygrothermal properties for the said materials in existing publication only have permeance and permeability. However, those properties are not included inside the HAMT model for the simulation to run effectively.

I would really appreciate it if someone could assist me in providing the hygrothermal properties of the said materials, which can be used in the HAMT model.

Thank you for reading.

Yours sincerely,

Murad

Subject: [Bldg-sim] ASHRAE 62 30% increase as it relates to EAc1
Message-ID: <25F2BDB6656B8F40A1289ED906D6B5CF06D49B5C@EXCHANGE1.cadd_group.ghtltd.com>

I'm having a tough time deciphering how the USGBC wants you to prove a
30% increase in OA (versus ASHRAE 62) for multi-zone systems, and how
this impacts the energy model for the proposed building.

 

There is a very specific way to determine the volume of outside air for
a multi-zone system (VPR using the 62MZCalc spreadsheet).  This takes
into account, among other things, room area, population, supply volume,
minimum primary air volume, efficiency of transfer air, system
efficiency, etc.  Once you understand all of the variables, it's fairly
straightforward to prove compliance with EQp1, and obtain the minimum OA
intake volume.

 

However, EQc2 requires a 30% increase in outside air volume for EACH
zone "above the minimum rates required by ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2004 as
determined by EQ Prerequisite 1".  Although I've received USGBC comments
before claiming that I have to prove that EACH zone has 30% more OA than
required by the VPR, can anyone confirm for sure if this is the case for
multi-zone systems?

 

To give you an example:

 

I've got a 33,000 square foot floor served by an AHU.  Standard office
space with 3 or 4 conference rooms.  I've used the 62MZCalc spreadsheet,
and determined that my AHU needs 3,800 CFM OA.  I've *designed* the
system to provide 7,000 CFM.  Almost twice the amount of outside air as
needed (I have DCV in place).  However, the critical conference room
doesn't get even the minimum required OA.  It doesn't need to - that's
the whole point of the Multizone calc, and a good reason to use series
fan-powered terminals.

 

Per the NCv2.2 Reference Guide, we are supposed to include the actual OA
volumes in the energy model, so I guess it's important to get this
right, especially for those clients that request a 30% increase.

 

Thanks in advance,

Message-ID: <A9E31731F7A9C14FA1E38F98A918D11001A75BED@peci-exch1.peci>

I was wondering if anyone has any recommendations on how to model an
eco-roof.  How are the U-values / R-values determined?  Are there any
standards referenced or typical assumptions made?  Are there substantial
energy savings associated with a eco-roof?

I've read a few studies that claim that there are and are not
significant energy savings associated with an eco-roof, and I was under
the impression that the major benefit of an eco-roof is storm water
mitigation and possible sewage savings.  I was hoping that the bldg-sim
group can shed some light on this topic. The projects I'm working on are
typically in the Pacific NW, where I would think the energy savings
associated with this technology would be minimal since the climate is
fairly temperate.  I would appreciate any thoughts you might have on
this technology, it's associated energy savings and modelling

I assume you are referring to so-called green roofs, that is vegetated
roofs. I too am in the NW, and have been asked several times about whether
we can take credit in the energy model for the benefits of a green roof. I
have usually erred on the side of caution, and advised that we not claim
benefit. 

 

This is partially due to the fact that when you most want the additional
R-value that the growth media might provide, during the winter, the soil
is most likely to be saturated with water and provide the least insulative
value. There obviously will still be some benefit compared to a bare roof,
but it would be pretty hard to quantify. There would also be great
variability in the effect depending the depth of the media, is it in trays
or directly on the roof, etc. 

 

I suppose that if you intend on watering the roof during the summer the
evapo-transpiration might help keep the roof area cooler and result in
lower cooling loads, though again, that would be difficult to quantify. 

 

I'd be interested if others out there have found some reputable data on
energy advantages to green roofs. Otherwise, I'd stick with the stormwater
and habitat benefits they provide as a selling point.

I have two suggestions for you:

1.       Use the GreenSave Life-Cycle Cost Benefit Calculator (http://www.tremcoroofing.com/greensave.asp) found on Tremco's website. Tremco is a roofing company.  They provide an on-line tool that calculates the life-cycle cost of green roofs.  It explains the energy savings methodology briefly and gives resources.

2.       Use DesignBuilder (interface for EnergyPlus; http://www.designbuilder.co.uk/) or EnergyPlus directly (http://energyplus.gov/).  The newest release of DesignBuilder, Version 2, now has the capability of modeling Green Roofs.  If you go their "new functionality" page and click on "Green roofs" link, it will give you a more detailed description of the modeling methodology.  DesignBuilder also allows you to account for irrigation control of the green roof and precipitation (entered into the model separately from the weather file).

Hope this helps!  Good luck.

Annual energy savings for three different cities for a "typical" green roof on a single story building. Savings estimates per sq.ft. of roof are fairly constant with building height, though they vary a moderate amount for heating energy. The analysis assumes natural gas heating and electric cooling.
Other studies have indicated a 1% decrease in heating energy and a 6% decrease in cooling energy associated with green roofs.

My 2 cents:

 

*         I would be careful of taking too much credit for the
evapotranspiration effect of green roofs. This really depends on the
plant selection since different plants have different rates of
transpiration. Furthermore, a lot of green roofs (especially on LEED
projects) use a plant palette of drought resistant plants (might be
different in the NW) - sedums and succulents, which typically have a
much lower rate of transpiration (some of them shut down in the really
hot summer months). 

*         Our office typically details green roofs with 3-4 inches of
polyiso because the soil does not really provide thermal resistance, (it
does provide thermal capacitance).

I have two suggestions for you:

1.       Use the GreenSave Life-Cycle Cost Benefit Calculator
(http://www.tremcoroofing.com/greensave.asp) found on Tremco's website.
Tremco is a roofing company.  They provide an on-line tool that
calculates the life-cycle cost of green roofs.  It explains the energy
savings methodology briefly and gives resources.

2.       Use DesignBuilder (interface for EnergyPlus;
http://www.designbuilder.co.uk/) or EnergyPlus directly
(http://energyplus.gov/).  The newest release of DesignBuilder, Version
2, now has the capability of modeling Green Roofs.  If you go their "new
functionality" page and click on "Green roofs" link, it will give you a
more detailed description of the modeling methodology.  DesignBuilder
also allows you to account for irrigation control of the green roof and
precipitation (entered into the model separately from the weather file).

 

Hope this helps!  Good luck. 

 

Here is an excerpt from the GreenSave site:

Annual Savings/sq.ft. of Roof Area

City

Heating
(therms/sq.ft.)

Cooling+Fans
(kWh/sq.ft.)

Phoenix, AZ

0.016

0.41

Washington, DC

0.020

0.29

Portland, OR

Source: Allen Lee, Quntec LLC

Annual energy savings for three different cities for a "typical" green
roof on a single story building. Savings estimates per sq.ft. of roof
are fairly constant with building height, though they vary a moderate
amount for heating energy. The analysis assumes natural gas heating and
electric cooling.

Other studies have indicated a 1% decrease in heating energy and a 6%
decrease in cooling energy associated with green roofs.

I assume you are referring to so-called green roofs, that is vegetated
roofs. I too am in the NW, and have been asked several times about
whether we can take credit in the energy model for the benefits of a
green roof. I have usually erred on the side of caution, and advised
that we not claim benefit. 

 

 

 

This is partially due to the fact that when you most want the additional
R-value that the growth media might provide, during the winter, the soil
is most likely to be saturated with water and provide the least
insulative value. There obviously will still be some benefit compared to
a bare roof, but it would be pretty hard to quantify. There would also
be great variability in the effect depending the depth of the media, is
it in trays or directly on the roof, etc. 

 

 

 

I suppose that if you intend on watering the roof during the summer the
evapo-transpiration might help keep the roof area cooler and result in
lower cooling loads, though again, that would be difficult to quantify. 

 

 

 

I'd be interested if others out there have found some reputable data on
energy advantages to green roofs. Otherwise, I'd stick with the
stormwater and habitat benefits they provide as a selling point.

Great question!
We have also run into this item and to my knowledge there is no validated method for a solution in Europe either. 

I had heard MIT had done some modelling of same but cannot locate it on the web.

The quantitative benefit of a green roof to the insulative, cooling loads of buildings is very difficult to quantify as the roof constuction, roof media, depth of soil and vegetation, precipitation, temp, humidity and wind all habe to be factored in.

In all cases so far we have just claimed credit for using collected rainwater as grey or black water for washroom use, thereby reducing the buildings consumption of potable water.

Perhaps a topic for a Doctorate study?

On a similar topic, would you rank a reflective (cool) roof as more energy
efficient when compared to green roof?

Message-ID: <892588.26683.qm@web51502.mail.re2.yahoo.com>


Hi All,
We are trying to model a heat pump heat recovery system in eQUEST where the heat pump system will retrieve waste heat from the exhaust air stream and pass it on into the supply air stream. Depending on the supply air temperature at the VAV AHU, the heat pump will utilize a little more energy to boost the temperature of the supply air in case it is lower than the hot deck temperature. The reverse cycle should happen in the summer where the heat pump captures coolth from the exhaust air stream and might utilize a little more energy to provide the right supply temperature at say 55F or boost it as much as the capacity of the heat pump. This might be different configurations of this system and we are looking if anyone has dealth with this issue before or if there are any useful resources we can turn too since there is very little information on this kind of HR system.

Thanks in advance,

Gerald

Hello;

Check ENVI-met plants sub-model that can be used for roofs.
It can has a U-value and Albedo for roofing so that, if you can measure or
provide it for the model, you can simulate that roof.

There was a presentation at BSUG recently on recommended workarounds for
modeling VRF in eQUEST.  At present you cannot model this system type
directly in eQUEST.

Presentation notes are here (you may need to be a member of the BSUG Yahoo
Group to access):

http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/BSUG/

The presentation notes are in the files section.

Note - you may want to look at equest-users list for eQUEST
questions/answers.  It is also hosted by onebuilding.org

I thank you for all the valuable answers. One last question is, do you think 
USGBC would accept simulation results by eQuest carried out the way Mr. 
Oylear has suggested or the way Mr. Schrader mentions in his posts? Or would 
they only accept results if VRF modelling is done by EnergyPro?

accepted the spreadsheet method on a previous job.  There is nothing
really absurd about the calculation.  It is per Appendix G's methodology
for Exceptional Calculation Methods when a program cannot model a

Hi Omer, 
I do not have a reference of the method suggested by Mr.Oylear. However, I do support Robby's opinion. USGBC does not advance the use of any specific simulation software. Savings from any strategy beyond  the capacity of the simulation tool should be determined as per Appendix G's methodology for Exceptional Calculation Methods. Support your claims with spreadsheet calculations and /or robust research and clearly explain your methodology. This is acceptable to USGBC. 
Hope this helps.

Hi,
We ever did some experiments in wind tunnel as well as on-site measurements in south China, where cooling load is huge but almost no heating load. The most difficult thing we found is how to qualify the effect of evapotranspiration of various plants in different weather conditions. Finally, we have a basic conclusion that, for sedum lineare in green roof, it can increase the R-value of 0.5 m2K/w when calculating for the cooling load. But not applicable for heating load. This number is quite a rough one and specified for the hot climatic areas only.

I have two suggestions for you:

1.       Use the GreenSave Life-Cycle Cost Benefit Calculator (http://www.tremcoroofing.com/greensave.asp) found on Tremco's website. Tremco is a roofing company.  They provide an on-line tool that calculates the life-cycle cost of green roofs.  It explains the energy savings methodology briefly and gives resources.

2.       Use DesignBuilder (interface for EnergyPlus; http://www.designbuilder.co.uk/) or EnergyPlus directly (http://energyplus.gov/).  The newest release of DesignBuilder, Version 2, now has the capability of modeling Green Roofs.  If you go their "new functionality" page and click on "Green roofs" link, it will give you a more detailed description of the modeling methodology.  DesignBuilder also allows you to account for irrigation control of the green roof and precipitation (entered into the model separately from the weather file).

 

Hope this helps!  Good luck. 

 

Here is an excerpt from the GreenSave site:

Annual Savings/sq.ft. of Roof Area

      City
     Heating
      (therms/sq.ft.)
     Cooling+Fans
      (kWh/sq.ft.)

      Portland, OR
     0.020
     0.25
     

Source: Allen Lee, Quntec LLC

Annual energy savings for three different cities for a "typical" green roof on a single story building. Savings estimates per sq.ft. of roof are fairly constant with building height, though they vary a moderate amount for heating energy. The analysis assumes natural gas heating and electric cooling.

Other studies have indicated a 1% decrease in heating energy and a 6% decrease in cooling energy associated with green roofs.

I assume you are referring to so-called green roofs, that is vegetated roofs. I too am in the NW, and have been asked several times about whether we can take credit in the energy model for the benefits of a green roof. I have usually erred on the side of caution, and advised that we not claim benefit. 

 

 

 

This is partially due to the fact that when you most want the additional R-value that the growth media might provide, during the winter, the soil is most likely to be saturated with water and provide the least insulative value. There obviously will still be some benefit compared to a bare roof, but it would be pretty hard to quantify. There would also be great variability in the effect depending the depth of the media, is it in trays or directly on the roof, etc. 

 

 

 

I suppose that if you intend on watering the roof during the summer the evapo-transpiration might help keep the roof area cooler and result in lower cooling loads, though again, that would be difficult to quantify. 

 

 

 

I'd be interested if others out there have found some reputable data on energy advantages to green roofs. Otherwise, I'd stick with the stormwater and habitat benefits they provide as a selling point.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modelling an eco-roof / green roof

 

 

 

I was wondering if anyone has any recommendations on how to model an eco-roof.  How are the U-values / R-values determined?  Are there any standards referenced or typical assumptions made?  Are there substantial energy savings associated with a eco-roof?

 

I've read a few studies that claim that there are and are not significant energy savings associated with an eco-roof, and I was under the impression that the major benefit of an eco-roof is storm water mitigation and possible sewage savings.  I was hoping that the bldg-sim group can shed some light on this topic. The projects I'm working on are typically in the Pacific NW, where I would think the energy savings associated with this technology would be minimal since the climate is fairly temperate.  I would appreciate any thoughts you might have on this technology, it's associated energy savings and modelling assumptions.

 

Thanks, 

 

Erin

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Parametric Runs and Boiler/Water Heater Losses
Message-ID: <005401c9d988$46cb5480$d461fd80$@com>

Hello eQuest Users,

I am using eQuest 3.61e and modeling lighting improvements through a
parametric run.  The only component that I am changing for the parametric
run is the Lighting W/ft2 for the entire building.  My boilers and water
heaters are located inside the building in a mechanical zone (which also
gets the lighting density reduction).  My parametric run is showing fuel
losses in my space heating (boilers) and domestic hot water categories on
the order of magnitude of 2% of the building fuel use (2,460 therms).  If I
change the zone of the boilers and water heaters to outside, the fuel use
for this parametric run is not affected.  I understand that there may be
additional tank losses due to a smaller heating load from the lights but, in
reality, this penalty seems excessive.

Can anyone verify that this is appropriate or is there an overall tank
U-value input that I can adjust to eliminate this loss?  I would like to
avoid keeping the boilers outside if possible.

Thanks,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Selecting a baseline HVAC system for storage / warehouse?
Message-ID: <25F2BDB6656B8F40A1289ED906D6B5CF06D49BAE@EXCHANGE1.cadd_group.ghtltd.com>

I'm modeling a 5-story, 99,000 square foot self-storage facility for the
purpose of the energy efficiency tax credit for commercial buildings.

 

Based on the ASHRAE 90.1 User's Manual, I believe this facility would
fall under System 5 (Packaged VAV with reheat boxes fed from a hot water
loop).  However, the spaces themselves are kept at non-standard
conditions.  55 degrees during heating season, 80 degrees during cooling
season.  The owners have discovered that 5-ton residential split systems
(with condensing furnaces) are great at being a budget HVAC system that
maintains the space temps.

 

Is a system with five (5) DX RTUs feeding shutoff VAV boxes with hot
water reheat fed from a central boiler system really the Baseline
building?  Seems like overkill, and it seems like there is no way that
it would be more efficient than a couple split systems per floor.

 

The storage units are all open to each other, so based on App G, it
looks like I just have to model a zone for each exposure and an interior
zone.

 

Any thoughts?  Is this the proper Baseline system?

 

Thanks!

Section 9.6.3 of ASHRAE Std 90.1 suggests that for spaces in which
lighting is specified to be installed to meet the requirements of visual
display terminals, an increase of up to 3.8 W/m2 is permitted on the
interior lighting power allowance already suggested by the
space-by-space method. 
Is this acceptable for LEED?
 
Many thanks,

OPTICS program from LBNL will calculate optical properties of substrate 
glazing with applied film.  After the model is completed in OPTICS, you 
can import such layer in WINDOW program and calculate SHGC of 
multi-layer glazing, where one of the layers is glass with applied film, 
imported from OPTICS.

Message-ID: <F5D2BE9CCB17974BA7C0C423FC4A29350105461FB138@AUEXC01.global.arup.com>

Dear all,

I've been trying to simulate a solar thermal system for reheat in EnergyPlus but encountered lots of problems.
The laboratory building requires 6 ach at all times and strict temp and RH control. The original arrangement has a gas boiler providing hot water at 80 degree c to reheat coils sitting in zones. As a result of high humidy level and reduced sensible load at night, the reheat energy shoots up horrendously, though reheat is also needed during day time. The idea is to have a large solar collector array to cover the roof space and a storage tank to store hot water for night use. The size of the collector and storage system needs to be optimised to match the hot water need. But to kick start, the solar collector is simulated as one whole piece (shading surface:detached, around 1000m2) and parametric data is taken from the E+ dataset. I have managed to get all the connections right by following the example file: a mixed heater's (no heating capacity storage tank) source side connected to the solar collector and use side to another mixed heater (auxiliary heater) and to the rest of the hot water plant. But after running it a few times, I've got very strange results. The solar collector's efficiency is extremely low, e.g. 0.00001 but outlet temperature goes up to 200 degree c (steam?). The storage tank remains unfortunately cold. I suspect the large solar collector I put in the model (around 1000m2) is only functioning as a parametrically standard one (2 to 3 m2) and the rest area is functioning as a bypass. I tried to put in a small collector, same size and parameters as that's specified in the example file, and found the output more sensible.
In addition to ways to correct my input to get sensible output, another question is in the case of such a system how should it be sized in terms of tank storage capacity and solar collector size and output temperature to better match the mostly night reheat need.
Any comments are appreciated.

Thanks

WINDOW database also has some films, products from 3M, SouthWall Tech for example. You may find the one you are looking for there. But for coatings you'll have to do it in OPTICS as Charlie had pointed out.

Hello All,

I built a model using chilled water coil (cooling source), hot water coil (heating source) and hot water loop (heat water source), and redefined itin detail design model as following: (water side hvac system type)  water loop hp + cooling tower with HX + boilers, (air side hvac system type ) water loop hp. The model works fine with cold/hot water coils system. But, when I simulate it with water loop hp hvac system, I got the huge under heated hours, which seems the whole building was unheated. how to fix it? thanks in advance.

	Standard 90.1
Message-ID: <1A9189D598C7F046BA8A65FD8567B18C02BE6F3E@eurxmb05.global.arup.com>

Dear All,

Section 9.6.3 of ASHRAE Standard 90.1 suggests that for spaces in which
lighting is specified to be installed to meet the requirements of visual
display terminals, an increase of up to 3.8 W/m2 is permitted on the
interior lighting power allowance already suggested by the
space-by-space method.

Is this acceptable for LEED?

Regards,
Irene

Hello All,

I am working on a energy simulation model following Appendix G of
ASHRAE 90.1-2004.
In this appendix, table G3.1, under the building envelope category
specifies that for roofs- insulation is entirely above deck but does
not specific the kind of construction. Can I use any kind of material
(like RCC, cast concrete or a metal frame) with insulation above deck
to meet the required U value. Please clarify.

Thanks & Regards,

Sambhav Tiwari.

Sambhav:

My understanding is that you only need put in a simple U-value for the Specification method (see attached Word Document). You then create your actual construction in your Proposed case.

	energy simulation workshop
Message-ID: <012e01c9df12$f62dc590$e28950b0$@com>

We are holding a 2-Day DesignBuilder/EnergyPlus  "advanced" building energy
simulation workshop  at Pacific Energy Center, downtown San Francisco on
Wednesday and Thursday, 17 - 18 June 2009. The workshop is being lead by Dr
Mahabir Bhandari of DesignBuilder Software (USA) and PC Thomas of Team
Catalyst Pty Ltd (Australia). Both personnel have extensive experience in
the use and teaching of building energy simulation programs. Participants
will use the DesignBuilder/EnergyPlus suite extensively over the two days. 

Day1 will be focused on developing building geometry with DesignBuilder,
importing from 2D-DXF and 3D gbXML import from CAD.  Various DB features,
including complex geometry, template  and Model Data Management, Schedules,
Heating Design, Cooling Design, Simulation options, parametric runs will be
discussed.

 Day2 will be focused on modelling systems using EnergyPlus.  A simple
5-zone model will be exported from DesignBuilder to EnergyPlus.  The native
IDF Editor will be used to develop HVAC Template options to generate a VAV
system.  A series of HVAC design upgrades will be tested.  These could
include, adding AHUs, supply air reset control, VSD drives, low turn down
ratios, low static pressure ductwork, or upgrading air cooled to water
cooled plant.  

EnergyPlus is a public domain program and can be downloaded from :
http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/

A free 30 days evaluation copy of DesignBuilder ver 2.0 can be downloaded
from: http://www.designbuildersoftware.com/designbuilder.php or
http://www.designbuilder.co.uk/

This workshop is a great opportunity for training staff in predicting the
energy/greenhouse performance of buildings.  These skills would be
invaluable in the current tough economic climate juxtaposed with increasing
concern about global warming.  Projects that do proceed, either new or
renovation, will have an increased focus on sustainable performance.  We
look forward to meeting with you at the workshop.

Robby

Here are a few options that you could use:

A simple excel sheet (offered as web form) 
http://vesma.com/tutorial/uvalue01/uvalue01.htm

 

If you don't mind SI units, there are some more advanced versions with
good graphics 

from the UK http://www.builddeskonline.com/   

or also a nice Austrian tool by ArchiPhysik 
http://www.archiphysik.at/webphysik/index.php that gives you also a
hygrothermal performance graph, which is required in some European codes
for hygrothermal performance.

Both are free for simplified online usage. If you are looking for a
conversion tool for these SI units go to: http://www.unitconversion.org/
or in your case to 
http://www.unitconversion.org/unit_converter/thermal-conductivity.html
or directly use the conversion factor: 1 BTU/h.sf.F equals 5.68 W/m2.K
or the other way round 1 W/m2.K equals 0.176 BTU/h.sf.F

 

Hope that helps,

Georg

Hello,

I am simulating a non residential building of two floors with a total
conditioned floor area less than 75000 sq ft. The building maps with
System 4 PSZ-HP ,of table G3.1.1A Appendix G of  ASHRAE 90.1-2004.
The System Type is specified as Packaged rooftop heat pump in table
G3.1.1B, but I could not find the appropriate table which provides me
the COP of a system with this name.
Please guide me to know the correct table of ASHRAE 90.1-2004 which
gives the COP of the above mentioned system.

Thanks & Regards,

Sambhav Tiwari.

Hi,

As per Table G3.1 of ASHRAE 90.1- 2004:"Opaque assemblies used for new
buildings or additions shall conform with the following common,* lightweight
assembly types* and shall match the appropriate assembly maximum U-factors
in Tables 5.5-1 through 5.5-8"
As the code mentioned all the constructions to be lightweight assemblies, my
guess is, that only insulation is to be modeled. I hope somebody can throw
some more light on this.

Regards,

Surekha Tetali

The assembly construction editor is one of the best pieces of the EE4
software which is available free from Natural Resources Canada at...

http://canmetenergy-canmetenergie.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca/eng/software_tools/ee4.html

It is very similar to Energy10 in format and allows dynamic switching
between SI & IP units.  There is a selection of common building materials
and the construction editor calculates equivalent 1-D heat transfer
U-value for 1 layer of framing elements.

Good luck.

Hello,
I am currently simulating energy modelling for a senior home using eQuest.
In the Mechanical design there is a geothermal loop providing cooling and
heating for the building.  At the same time two boilers are suplying heat to
the geothermal loop when the geothermal loop temperature is low.  I am not
able to model this in eQuest.  Can someone let me know how I can do that?
Also, the geothermal loop is preheating the DHW using two water to water
heat pump.  How do I input that in the eQuest.  I would like to thank
eveyone in advance for your help.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] ASHRAE 90.1 & LEED NC applicability to Low rise hotels
Message-ID: <e1c901780905281015h3e630180raf27e60a6f41def1@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am working on the energy simulation of a hotel building of  two floor
height and one lakh square foot.
Is ASHRAE 90.1-2004 and LEED NC applicable for this project?

I found the following relevant sections;

LEED NC Page 14,  "III A : When to Use LEED for New Construction" ,
according to this, hotel of any size is a commercial occupancy and LEED NC
is applicable.

According to ASHRAE 90.1-2004 definition of  "low rise residential"  as
given on Page 9, hotels doesn't come under low rise residential buildings.
And as per the foot notes of Table G3.1.1A on page 176 of Appendix G ASHRAE
90.1-2004, hotel is considered as a residential building but not a low rise
residential building and ASHRAE is only not applicable to low rise
residential building.

>From all the above it is clear that ASHRAE 90.1-2004 and LEED NC are
applicable for this project, however it would be great if anyone can give
more inputs in this regard.

Thanks & Regards,

I do not believe 90.1 applies to the project you describe.  I have
modeled a few 3-story condo buildings and feel that the Standard is
equally inappropriate for those.  Unfortunately, since LEED does not
recognize Standard 90.2, (and I do not believe 90.2 has a section
equivalent to 90.1's Appendix G,) we are stuck trying to apply as much
of the Standard as is appropriate.

Message-ID: <B5E1397BF6CFFD4D8352E2324AB9C2ED0342D8E0@CD1001-M210.corp.ads>

Hello,

I would like some suggestion on modeling approach for situation in which a building primary heat source is a campus central geothermal plant. I am trying to comply with Oregon SEED ( State Energy Efficiency Code) target of 20% energy savings and simultaneously prepare a model for LEEd EA credit. The building is dormitory ( classified as residential)

Building HVAC system.
The primary distribution system for this building is 2-pipe fan coil units with buildings central plant having an Air cooled Scroll Chiller( Chilled water ) and a Brazed Plate Heat Exchanger (Heating Hot Water).

The problem I am facing is with the modeling procedures outlined in both SEED and LEEd. Both the guidelines don't seen to address the above situation at this point and does not allow us to take credit for geothermal well ( which is free source ). For example, in the case of SEED modeling guidelines, it points us to use steam meter in both the proposed case and baseline case, with baseline system being PTHP and when it comes to LEED, if the above described system falls under the District energy system definitions and criteria. Further instructions in the STEP 2 of the guidelines,  points us towards using a boiler in the proposed case to represent a virtual plant. 

I feel both the modeling procedures do not allow the project to take credit of using the geothermal central source. If any one of you have come across a similar situation, I would really appreciate if you shed some light.

Thanks for all the replies, I've sifted through all of the software tools
that have been sent but haven't quite found what I'm looking for.  I'd
prefer for the tool to be fairly simplistic in the fact that I don't want
to be calculating framing percentages for each type of wall (maybe rules
of thumb for each wall type would come into play here, but it'd be nice if
the program did this automatically).  EE4, GreenTools, and CHVAC all
required inputs for framing percentages.  Also, a conversion to IP is
nice, but not all that useful when all of the database materials are
labeled in RSI and mm values (EE4).  

EnergyPro has a fairly good assembly calculator in terms of using the JA4
library for the framing values and not requiring any further inputs in
that matter.  However, EnergyPro doesn't have any material database for
the additional layers (polystyrene, polyiso, sheathing, etc.).

To summarize my needs:
- IP units
- Default values for framed walls OR R-values determined by spacing of
studs
- Material Database for other wall layers (exterior rigid, interior gyp,
etc.)
- Preferably not a subset of a larger program

Does anyone have any more ideas on whether there's a software package out
there that meets my needs, or am I just being too picky?

Robby,

EE4 comes with a fairly good modelling guide which lists framing
percentages for typical assemblies based on stud spacing.  I really
don't see a problem with EE4's use of RSI values considering the
conversion is a simple calculation.  If you really want to calculate IP
for each assembly layer, it's an extra 30 seconds to convert each
layer's RSI value to IP manually.

I routinely use EE4 for assemblies, and another program for the full
energy simulation.  I may be a biased Canuck, but I think it meets all
of your needs, with minimal manual input.  Most software tools out there
have their pros and cons and you never really get all that you want, but
maybe a silver bullet does exist.

Hi,

I am currently starting up on simulating a relatively large atrium in Denmark (app. 55?N) with a glazed roof (sloped towards the sun - clever), open balconies with working areas connected to the atrium, as well as a smaller atrium with smaller openings connecting the two atria together with each other. The main focus in the simulation is first of all the air velocity and temperature distribution in the occupied zone and on the balconies - describing the thermal comfort as well as draft rate. The next focus is on integrating the smaller atria as a heat exchanger in winter time as well as analyzing if this can be used for cooling in summer time, transporting the air from outside to the biggest atrium, via the smaller atrium with little heating of the air. The calculations I want to perform in CFD also regards simulations of the solar gain in the biggest atrium. However simulating radiation in CFD simulations require more computing power for bigger rooms with a lot of surfaces. Any advice on simulating solar gain in CFD? How can this dynamic gain be simulated in CFD? Another cool thing in this atrium would be the heat recovery of the extracted air in the top part of the atrium.

Simulating this in a thermal simulation software requires a lot of luck to obtain the correct (and true) result in the first couple of simulations. However I am thinking of integrating the results from a CFD calculation into the thermal simulation. I am thinking of doing this as an iterative process, integrating the results from CFD when needed in the thermal simulations. This will probably result in at least 4 different simulations over a whole year, giving detailed results (temperature gradient, flow between zones, convective heat-transfer coefficients etc.) which can be used in the thermal simulation for these 4 periods over a year. As mentioned above simulating radiation in CFD is tough, I am thinking of leaving this calculation in the thermal simulation.

Another simpler setup would be the integration of a multi-zone calculation in the thermal simulation giving a more coarse result of the main flow route in the atrium and mixing between balconies and the atrium. However these results could potentially give the same detailed results I am looking for.

Finally has any one worked on an uncertainty analysis of these coupling methods illustrating first of all the uncertainty in the results as well as the sensitivity in the input parameters?

Has anyone done something like this before and what tools were used? I have been given free hands with regards to choice of software so any feedback on this subject will be useful. I'm really looking forward to hear from you :-)

Hi Frederik,

 

DesignBuilder CFD would allow you to come up with an EnergyPlus multizone
air flow linked thermal simulation coupled with a steady state CFD solution.
This has recently been released and is a cost-effective way of linking the
2.  If you used DesignBuilder to develop the energy model/Steady State CFD
solution carried out and then use their model export options to give you the
model upon which to then import it into a more complex transient CFD tool
should it be necessary.  To some extent you could argue whether or not you
need the transient analysis as the dynamic simulations should give you the
temporal solution for the airflow and then you could look at what happens
for say peak or mean flow conditions perhaps.  But I?d suggest that it might
well be worth it from what you are describing as even a well set up thermal
multizone model would do most of what you describe, but the thermal
stratification issues are going to be a sticking point for most simulation
tools, both Dynamic or CFD to some extent.

 

If you really wanted to see the time effects of the Solar Gain on airflows,
etc, there are many CFD tools available that would be able to do this,
obviously all the major CFD engines would do this comfortably (Airpak from
Ansys Fluent most easily I suspect with its integrated solar gain modelling
tool) but they are going to be quite expensive and there is quite a learning
curve to some of them.

 

Alternatively, you could use something like PyroSim, which is a good front
end for NIST that would probably be suitable.  NIST does transient analysis
and is used commonly for smoke/fire analysis.  It uses LES turbulence models
from memory and so would be likely to be more accurate for the sort of
stratified flows you?d get in an Atria as well.  You could then set
transient boundaries based on files of data exported by the dynamic engine.
Might take a bit of work, but it should work.

 

Regards

Paul

Frederik, I have worked on a couple of large atrium projects over the years. You did ask for comments and suggestions so here goes:

You need a tool that can predict conditions in a quite complicated space and looking at you location you will have two major problems:

1.	downdraft and cold radiation during the winter
2.	high radiation surface and possible stratification during the summer.

 

I model the space with ROOM (ARUP Rand D, Mike Holmes and Andrew White) or lately TRNSYS. This enables me to set up heat balances and run fairly quickly (once the models have been built), and provide what if scenarios for both summer and winter. ROOM enables me to look at radiation exchange in the space and occupant comfort, as well as stratification. TRNSYS will allow analysis of air movement within the space, this is especially important when heating the space in winter.

Once these have been completed you can step to CFD (Colours for Directors), at this point I will probably get shot down, but most of the CFD programs I know are steady state, so for one moment in time. The next problem is the complexity of the space, the grids and the number of cells all of which increase the validity of the results and drastically increase computational time. For example CFD runs for the atrium in the LA courthouse were between 56 to 72 hours each.

I think you need to work out what results you require and the level of accuracy of these results. Is this a design problem or an academic project?

We published a paper on temperatures and bulk air movement for a large atrium in a hospital in the Netherlands, which had a large glazed roof and numerous openings, this was about 15 years ago and is published in ASHRAE transactions. I also presented a paper on a large atrium/shopping mall in Warsaw at the opening of DTU new labs in 2001. The LA courthouse data has never been published as it is the property of the client, but I may be able to find some of the results for you. To give you some idea of the costs and time involved for this particular analysis, the CFD analysis alone was in the order of $120,000 and our effort, temperature, air movement, thermal comfort and stratification as well as writing a report, that could be understood by the client another $240,000 and we didn't make any profit.

I hope this helps, if not let me know what else you need, good luck.

Hi
I modeled a single zone building with DX coil and parallel fan-power box. I try to find the electrical power end-use of exhaust fan. ?The following are several parameters in the model.
INFILTRATION: Zero
RETURN-FAN-LOC: Relief
SUPPLY-KW/FLOW: Same for supply and return fans
RETURN-CAP-RATIO: 1
Fan EIR curve: Same for supply and return fans
I assume that the exhaust fan just removes the outside air. ?However, for a few hours at the beginning of occupied period, Return fan elec (kW) is equal to Supply fan elec (kW) even the Ratio of outside air to total supply air is not 100%. I am not sure how eQUEST calculates the exhaust airflow rate when using a relief fan. Your feedback on this issue is highly appreciated.
Thanks,

Hello Sambhav,

For System 4 PSZ -HP and System 6 minimum efficiency is taken from TABLE
6.8.1A of ASHRAE 90.1-2004.

It will be appreciated if any corrections.

Thanks & Regards,
Ashraf

Hello All,

In continuation my earlier query,
I could not also find the appropriate table for COP of system 6-
Packaged VAV of Table G3.1.1A of  Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1-2004.
Sorry for my innocence regarding these issues but it would be really
great if any one can guide me for selecting the appropriate COP for
both the PSZ-HP (please refer to my query below) and PVAV w/PFP boxes
systems of the system mapping table in Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1-2004.


Thanks & Regards,

Sambhav Tiwari.
