My thanks to all those who contributed to this discussion thread.  
I have so far about 12 people volunteering to participate in the schema
development.  

This is a voluntary effort to represent energy simulation data in one dialect
(EnerXML).
With tools such as BizTalk server 2000 mappers, we should benefit without
translators to interface with other simulation programs and CAD applications
using the EnerXML schema.

I will have a DTD skeleton ready next week to start work on the schema.  
Instead of overloading this mail server, I will send this only to those who have
volunteered. 
If you are interested in reviewing the tag definitions, please let me know.  

When the draft schemas are finalized, I will post it and announce to this list
for review and comments - possibly within the next three months.
Once the schemas are agreed upon, then we can start developing interface tools,
and start working with EnerXML data files.

I agree that we should try to work with what IFC has done. The problem is
that the work of the organization is not really open for public review.
Unless IFC
is willing to release its "proprietary" information into a public forum like
the
BLDG-SIM list, I think we should begin to develop our own XML schema.

Actually, I am hopeful that aecXML will build on the "tree" that is already in
the IFC model.  It is the leaves of the IFC model that need further
development.  I think that aecXML schema can help this development if done in
parallel.  Also, I am not yet convinced that XML-based data exchange is
appropriate for all details of a building project.  I see equipment and other
component manufacturers gaining the most from XML-based data exchange -
information-rich catalogs and e-commerce transactions.  Of course, this assumes
that manufacturers (e.g., chillers) will become willing to share their
performance data.

I find this discussion fascinating and encouraging.  My only 2 cents are
that this effort should start at the top of the "tree," with the building,
sites, plant, system, lighting, equipment, etc., not at the bottom with
envelope materials and assemblies.  

All may be eventually be expressed in EnXML (lose the "er"), but it is the
former that will first catch the imagination of those who need to "buy in"
to make this effort fly.  In the eyes of the moneyed decisionmakers, it's
chillers and lighting fixtures that consume operating $, not envelope
materials.

I expect the EnerXML initiative to build consensus on the tag terminology to
standardize schema definitions.  It will be consistent with the IAI/IFC
model
and build off of any published domain extensions or XML schemas available.
I
have made an IAI/aecXML working group proposal to the Design/Spec group to
include energy simulation data.  My focus currently is the representation of
thermal properties data for envelope materials and assemblies.  If you are
already using schemas or have suggestions for parts of  schemas, please let
me
know and I will incorporate them and make it available through aecXML
submissions and BizTalk/OASIS servers.

I agree that library/catalog performance specs for building
components like equipment and materials makes a lot of sense.
This would support e-commerce applications, and the ability to
search the web for component data that could be directly imported
into energy simulation models.

I feel that this work should be coordinated with the aecXML effort
underway within the International Alliance for Interoperability
(IAI).  See http://www.aecxml.org/index2.htm for more
information.  We are on the verge of achieving some level of
software interoperability with the IFC data model being developed
by the IAI.  It would be a shame to develop an XML schema that did
not build on this work.

Krishnan,

GeoPraxis has been working on an XML schema that is based on the aecXML
(http://www.aecxml.org/) schema for our California Energy Commission (CEC)
project. We are 80% complete with its development and are currently testing
it with DOE-2.2. We will be publishing this schema in the later part of May.

Through our CEC project (http://www.geopraxis.com/cec.htm) we are developing
a software module that will work with any 3D-CAD application that supports
the XML schema we develop. This software module will conduct DOE-2.2
simulations of the 3D-CAD building model a user has entered. The first
3D-CAD application to support our schema will be DesignWorkshop developed by
Artifice, Inc (http://www.artifice.com/).

We would welcome the opportunity to work with you Krishnan and look forward
to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
John F. Kennedy

Exchange



I would like to propose the development of an XML schema for marking up
Energy
simulation data files that can be easily transferred between simulation
software
and other applications.  For those unfamiliar with XML, data files in XML
are
simply ASCII files containing tags that make the data self-describing, if
the
schema definitions are standardized and understandable.

If you are an energy software developer and interested in supporting or
participating in the schema development effort, please let me know.
At present, this is a voluntary effort aimed at interoperable and neutral
data
representation for building energy software data.

Along with weather, three other areas related to building 
simulation that make sense to have an XML format for are:

a) Equipment performance specifications - nominal and part 
load and temperature correction curves, 

b) Utility rate models - block charges, time of use rates, 
and applicablity, and

c) Materials/constructions descriptions for opaque and 
transparent building surfaces.

These could be integrated into an overall "enerXML" but 
since they could also benefit other types of software they 
may be best being independent schemas.

Has any XML format been established yet for weather data used for energy
simulation software?  We've got several weather data formats out there, and
it would be convenient if these formats were made neutral by embedding the
self-describing variables and data formats right in the file.  This seems
like it would be the easiest to accomplish and the most readily used
database.

If not much has been done on this, I would be glad to work on it this
summer.  What rules and guidelines are available for developing XML schemas?

Hello,
I have a specific question regarding the Compressor kW= f(condensing temp)
curve fit for modeling refrigeration in PowerDOE.  This curve fit returns a
factor from about .5 to 1.25 in the provided default curve
"Refg-kW-fECT-T1."

I am making my own curve based on published data for the compressors that
are in place at the store I am modeling.

1) Does the factor returned by this curve fit only apply to compressor input
kW?  If so, how is the effect of compressor capacity as a function of
condensing temperature taken into account?   I think that it would make more
sense if this factor was applied to EER.  Is that the case?

2) In the default curve, the factor is 1.00 at about 100 F condensing
temperature.  Should you always normalize your curve to 100 F, or should you
set it equal to 1.00 at some other temperature based on the store
conditions, or at the same temperature that you calculated your EER?

Thanks for your help.

Sincerely,

Alec Stevens

goal of this survey is to analyze the changing roles of A/E/C
professionals and their access to technical information using current
technologies.

SWA will be holding a "drawing" from all survey respondents for a free
copy of The Passive Solar Design and Construction Handbook by Steven
Winter Associates, John Wiley & Sons, 1998.

If anyone else is interested in participating in our short survey , it
is not too late!  Please do so at your convenience by accessing the

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Input Sought on Draft Standard 140P
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200004100858.AA584093MD26375@gard.com>

Recently, a draft of Standard 140P was made available for 
public review.  The title, purpose and scope of 140P is:

Title:

BSR/ASHRAE Standard 140P, Standard Method of Test for the 
Evaluation of Building Energy Analysis Computer Programs.  

Purpose:

This standard specifies test procedures for evaluating the 
technical capabilities and ranges of applicability of 
computer programs that calculate the thermal performance of 
buildings and their HVAC systems.  

Scope:

These standard test procedures apply to building energy 
computer programs that calculate the thermal performance of 
a building and its mechanical systems. While these standard 
test procedures cannot test all algorithms within a 
building energy computer program, they can be used to 
indicate major flaws or limitations in capabilities.  

The public review period is from April 8 to June 6.  See 
ASHRAE's web site for a draft copy and the procedure to 
submit comments to ASHRAE:

http://www.ashrae.org/STANDARDS/pubrev140p.htm

Lets provide a good constructive review of a standard that 
is needed by the building energy simulation industry.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Online Survey for A/E/C Professionals
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200004071207.AA073401MD25968@gard.com>

Hello!

Steven Winter Associates is performing a Market Research Study for a
large publishing company. The publisher puts out an enormous number of
publications for the A/E/C industry. We need input from the following
categories: Architects, Engineers, Interior Designers, Contractors,
Project Managers, Construction Managers, Facility Managers,
and Landscape Architects.

The goal of the study is to analyze the changing roles of A/E/C
professionals and their access to technical information using current
technologies. Please take a look at the survey online at:
www.swinter.com/survey/survey.html . SWA will be holding a "drawing"
from all survey respondents for a free copy of The Passive Solar Design
and Construction Handbook by Steven Winter Associates, John Wiley &
Sons, 1998.

Should you wish to do this survey over the phone or by fax, please
contact me directly. Thank you all for your assistance with this survey.

Sincerely,
Debra Lombard, Engineer

I think the "easy" way is to spec a constant 48F SAT, and use the
COOLING-SCHEDULE in the system or syscontrol to refer to a schedule
with a value of 65F, thus turning off the coil in the modeled AHU,
below that temp. But check the SAT with the hourly report before you
take my word for it.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] supply air temp. reset in PowerDOE
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200004061045.AA455557MD25565@gard.com>

I am trying to model the following sequence of supply air temperature vs. outside air drybulb temp. in PowerDOE.

1) Drybulb above 65F -> Supply temp fixed at 48 F with mechanical cooling
2) Drybulb between 48 and 65 F -> 100% OA, no cooling, so supply temp varies between 48-65 (not including fan delta T, etc)
3) Drybulb below 48 F -> Supply temp fixed at 48 F with economizer cooling only, OA dampers modulate to provide correct supply temp.

The 65F setpoint may be lowered if room temps get too high.

I have been able to specify reset control of the supply temperature, but I think that this strategy will require at least two reset schedules, or a combination of reset and correct specs in the OA economizer section.

Any ideas?

Thanks.

Sincerely,

Alec Stevens
