Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Y2K has happened -- it's here!
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F199912310938.AA382356MD99023@gard.com>

Welcome into the new millenium from within Japan!  With the exception of
possibly being preempted by our colleagues from New Zealand, Guam,
Vladivostok and Australia, I wanted to be the first to welcome you into
the New Year.  Being on my computer during the moments that the clock
rolled over into Y2K I felt would be a good way to dispel the myths
about the possible existence of a Y2K bug.

Well, it's 3 minutes past midnight here in Japan -- the whistles,
sirens, bells and fireworks have now subsided and there's still no
indic at tion of any problems on the computers that surround me// in my
office.

I think we can conclude that the Y2K bug never did exist Xcept in the
minds of the sens at tionalists that might w at nt to sell more newspaapers,
virus softw at re or TV spots...  I can now comfor##tably l at ugh in the face
of those doomsd at y forec at sters that predikted the Y2K bug would bring us
to our 2Kknees.

I can guaran$(%%tee you with full//~ ashurance ... ##Tokyo stocks
[plunge...## that there w at z nevr @NYthing for you to worreeee abot.
This problim was all a hoXXxxxxx and we can just consinu to keep werkin
and gettine our seryus computing wurkkk akompli$%!!!shed.

It's a shame ###$@ that *^this past year has sCCeen us wast% so many
%$$aluable hours //wwworry#@((ing about Y2K KKompliance and /~the lik.
So, have a ^%Hhapy and prosperice ##NY stocks folloo##..r, and don't
worre anymoor about this prob$$)??>lem when the YRr 3K approh~~es.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F199912161301.AA010010MD96470@gard.com>

Dear Group:

Happy Holidays!  You might be feeling the strain from the hustle and bustle
of this holiday season.  If so, maybe we can help.

A few of the energy analysis projects we were scheduled to work on for the
next month have been put on hold or cancelled.  Therefore, we have DOE-2
(2.1E or 2.2) modeling and energy analysis capability available!  If you
need help meeting some deadlines, need extra analysis capacity or just want
more information about our department or firm, please call.

Our rates are competitive and we would like to establish relationships with
other consulting firms so we can reciprocate when we are swamped (CBG spent
most of 1999 in the overtime mode).

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best Regards,

John P. Karasaki, P.E.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F199912130827.AA270043MD95585@gard.com>

Hello everybody,
	Does anyone have experience with simulating comparatively thick walled
zones and buildings (0.5 - 1 m of earth, stone, concrete etc.)? I'm looking
for both tools and the underlying methods. Any guidance would be greatly
appreciated.

I am interested in finding two buildings to perform a research analysis
on.  I would need input information for DOE-2 (more specifically,
PowerDOE) and hourly electrical usage.  If anyone has any ideas, I would
appreciate the help.

Dear William W. Seaton,

Back in October we allowed you to refer others to 
ScienceWise Alert (formerly U.S. Opportunity Alert)
so that they could receive the service for free through
May 2000. Thanks to you, over 9,000 more of your 
colleagues are now receiving free research funding 
opportunities.

Because of that wonderful response, we are once again
allowing any of your colleagues that you refer to the
service to receive it absolutely free through May 2000.
However, your colleagues must register by Wednesday, 
December 7th. That is just one week away, so be sure to 
let them know right now. Simply forward them the link 
below:

       http://www.usalert.com/freeservice4.asp

Remember, we are NOT automatically charging at the end 
of this period, so the service truly is free during 
this time for you and your colleagues.

Regards,

Adam Waugh
ScienceWise Alert
http://www.sciencewise.com

P.S.  Please let us know anytime your email address changes.
