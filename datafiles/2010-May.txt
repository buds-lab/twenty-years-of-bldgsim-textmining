On one project the reviewer demanded that I 
increase the plug load cost from 23.5% to 
25%.  In my experience, the reviewer always looks 
for this one as it is an easy one to point to so 
the reviewer looks like he/she is doing their job.

As you may already know, my Presidential theme for ASHRAE next year is
"Modeling a Sustainable World". I will be promoting the use of early
modeling in integrated design to take advantage of the powerful energy
simulation tools we have available. I am writing to ask you to send me
jpeg images of energy models that you have created that I can use in
presentations. If you're willing to do that, please include the
following for each image that you send:

 

1.      The name of the project and where it is located. Also, the name
of the owner and your firm.

 

2.      Your contact information, in case I have questions.

 

3.      Your agreement to grant permission to ASHRAE to use this image
in non-commercial presentations - in both PowerPoint and printed form,
with or without project identification and/or attribution.

 

I'm hoping to assemble a collection of images for a wide variety of
building sizes, shapes, and complexity. Both individual buildings and
complexes.

 

Thanks for your assistance!

Message-ID: <015101caead5$8fd33e40$af79bac0$@com>

Let me see if I can add some clarity to the reasoning behind the 25% process
rule.

 

First of all and most important ? every project should model what has been
designed/built and nothing more.

 

The 25% value was selected since that is a pretty typical plug load
percentage for an office building (LEED was originally created for an office
building and there are still vestiges of this lineage).  This value was
never intended as a hard and fast minimum for all projects.  The intention
was to make sure that all energy uses in any building were accounted for in
the model, unfortunately it has been widely misunderstood.  This is an
indication that we have a problem in the LEED credit language.  LEED 2012 is
likely to drop this ?requirement?.

 

The 25% had nothing to do with raising the level of difficulty.  We clearly
understand that facilities with high process energy loads have a harder time
earning points in LEED than those with low loads.  This is a problem for
many LEED projects and USGBC is slowly adding baselines for process loads so
energy savings can be claimed against them.

 

One should NEVER add non-existing loads to get up to 25%.  This is
completely counter to the intention of this rule.

 

If you are under 25% James has it correct, simply document what you have.
Most typically this would include a spreadsheet and perhaps a narrative if
anything would need to be explained so the reviewer can understand the
situation.  In the vast majority of cases this information should exist as
it is often needed in order to perform the HVAC load calculations correctly.
So I don?t really understand the perceived difficulty.  For many building
types with only plug loads as process one can also use the W/sf values in
the 90.1 Unser?s Manual.

 

It is the intention of USGBC to make sure that the energy model addresses
all of the energy in and associated with the project.  This was the intent
of the 25% rule.  This language is in the credit requirement but its
connection to process energy is certainly not clear.

 

As a company that was one of the original 5 review firms, our reviewers will
question a project whose process energy is exactly 25%.  This gives the
appearance that either non-existing loads have been added or even worse that
process loads have not even been included in the models and a value equating
to 25% was added to the modeling results.  Again model what you have.  If
over 25% do nothing.  If under 25% document why.

 

Always keep in mind that the purpose behind modeling is to guide
design-decisions and to the greatest extent possible accurately project the
actual energy consumption of the facility.  Under the USGBC?s Building
Performance Initiative and MPR #6 in LEED 2009, your modeling results will
be compared to the actual building?s energy use (although this comparison
will not be made public on an individual project basis) so every effort to
improve quality and accuracy should be taken.

LoadsConundrum

 

Firstly, apologies for the cross-posting, but it appears this topic has
grown include many lists so I can?t come up with an alternative!

 

Secondly, a huge thanks to Carol, James and a large number of others (who
shall remain unnamed until they should decide to join the public discussion)
who have given me direct input on their personal thoughts, outside of the
mailing lists.

 

I have received a flood of suggestions regarding approaches when the intent
is to follow the 25% rule, and additionally regarding how one might go about
appeasing a USGBC LEED model reviewer when attempting to document a lower
figure.  My impression up until this point, based on colleagues?
experience/advice, has been that attempting to substantiate anything less
than 25% process loads would be a futile task and would be flatly rejected.
As a result I never really considered this to be an option available to us
LEED energy modelers.  I now understand that for many, documenting something
less than 25% has proven a feasible, if occasionally exhaustive, task.

 

When the intent is to follow the 25% baseline process load prescriptive
requirement, I have been exposed (again outside of the lists) to a
surprising number of unique viewpoints and seemingly legitimate approaches
which have led to successfully reviewed LEED model submissions for others.

 

Among the approaches to build the process loads to 25% are:

-          Adding a single direct internal/external load to the project
electrical meter in addition to the designed space equipment loads ? this
approach avoids additional internal heat gains.

-          Adding additional or redefining designed space equipment loads,
adding internal heat sources.  If and when these additional loads should
result in too many unmet cooling hours in the proposed model, there are two
basic approaches:

o   Specify larger system cooling capacities and/or airflows

o   Allow those systems cooling capacities/airflows to auto-size

-          Keeping the designed space equipment loads without adding any
further, but modifying their utilization schedules to increase space
equipment usage during non-peak cooling hours ? this of course adds heat to
the models, but avoids unmet cooling hours due to clashes with proposed
system cooling capacities.

 

I sincerely hope Carol and others will not misunderstand? Myself and others
do not wish to ?game the system,? but we seem to have a variety of
viewpoints as to what the intent is for the 25% rule.  

 

If it may help and add to the discussion, my personal opinion leading up to
this inquiry has been that the default 25% rule exists simultaneously as a
means of normalizing the ?difficulty level? of attaining LEED EAc1 points
for projects with various actual process loads.  Perhaps at some point in
time, somebody decided it would be unfair for someone designing a LEED
Platinum toolshed with zero process loads to have an easier time of it than
some poor sucker trying to get some EAc1 credits for an automotive
manufacturing facility with immense process loads?

 

I will unfortunately be unable to participate in or respond to this topic of
discussion for some time as I will be away from my inbox.  I very much look
forward to gaining a better understanding of how we as a group might come to
agree on a ?best practice? for this issue.  If anyone should currently have
access to a relevant CIR that would probably be very useful.

 

A humble thanks again to everyone,

 

~Nick

Hi Nick,

I'm glad you raised this issue. 

First, I agree with James, and have heard from other people, that LEED
accepts documentation saying something as basic as "hey, I don't have 25%
plug loads".

Second, when you have to create a baseline to measure up from, you are
forced to say what that baseline is. For instance, in 1985-86, working on
the BPA-funded Energy Edge project, we had to figure out the baseline for a
group of buildings being designed to exceed the current energy codes by 30%.
We didn't have a baseline then. To deal with this we assembled a group of
people that we euphemistically called The Greybeards (so sorry to you all).
The tables now known as G3.1.1A & G3.1.1B in Standard 90 came out of what we
created in that moment of time. We were trying to limit what is called
"gaming the system"

So now it seems it has been deemed important to control the baseline a
little more: by specifying plug loads at 25%. The goal of trying to limit
gaming the system might be the source of the 25%. The danger which Nick has
clearly demonstrated in his email is that what is meant to control gaming
the system, may now actually be creating it.

Further thoughts/comments welcome,

Carol

This is a good question.  On prior projects we have worked on, I have found
that you can have less than 25% plug loads, so long as you have some
documentation to back it up.

 

For example, we are currently working on a prison project.  The plug loads
are very low for obvious reasons; they don?t provide stereos, computers,
ipods, TV?s, etc. to the inmates (typically, all they get is an alarm
clock/radio that uses ~ < 10 watts).  There is no way on this project that
we could get the plug loads to come in at 25% unless we artificially jacked
them up to levels that would never exist in reality.  We would have a
similar problem in that the Proposed Design equipment would not be able to
cool the spaces.  So, we just document the loads we do have and I believe we
are good.  The project has been through the 1st review and this has not come
up as an issue.  

 

I believe we have had other projects where we documented the loads we had
and passed the review with no problems.  We will typically develop a simple
spreadsheet and document the internal loads that each room has.  That is
easy enough to do these days I believe, for most applications.  For example,
a typical desktop computer uses about 65 watts on average, monitor = ~ 45
watts (depending on size), clock radio ~ 10 to 15 watts, etc. you get the
point.  (get a ?Killawatt? power meter from Amazon and have some fun taking
some measurements to see approximately how much power stuff uses, guaranteed
to provide hours of fun).

 

Just provide some documentation on some good reasonable estimates for the
loads and I think you will be fine.

 

An alternate method is to use default values from Table G-B from the ASHRAE
90.1-2007 Users Manual.

 

For example, the Receptacle Power Density for the Office Building Type is
0.75 watts/SF per Table G-5.

 

If using that value results in the process loads being less than 25%, my
comment to the reviewers would be that the 0.75 watts/SF is the value
determined by ASHRAE to be appropriate for the building type.

 

I think the most important thing is to use something reasonable and
defendable, and make it the same between the Baseline and Proposed Design
energy models.  Our experience indicates that it does not have to be exactly
25%, can be less than 25% or greater than 25%, depending on the building.

 

One thing that is interesting is that on federal projects, per EPACT
requirements, you do not have to factor in the process/recep loads for the
purpose of determining whether the 30% savings requirement has been met.
That makes it easier to show 30% savings.  

 

Thanks!

Subject: [Bldg-rate] LEED+90.1 Process/Plug Loads Conundrum

 

Something new occurred to me this week and I?d love to hear others?
thoughts!

 

LEED prescribes baseline/proposed energy models to follow ASHRAE 90.1 with a
caveat:  the ?process energy costs? must total 25% of the baseline energy
costs.  By extension, 90.1 requires the same loads/schedules be applied to
the proposed model as they have to match.  As an aside, the LEED EAc1
templates appear to calculate/check this using process energy consumption

I just had a typical case where I had to inflate the baseline internal
miscellaneous equipment loads to get to 25%.  These additional loads were

into many unmet cooling hours for the equipment capacities entered.  

 

Then I realized:  We can define additional equipment electricity loads but

Would this practice (which incidentally can be a time saver) of accounting
for extra process/miscellaneous loads without extra thermal contributions be
in line with the intent of ASHRAE/USGBC?  It would still normalize the
otherwise unstandardized process consumption/costs of the baseline/proposed
models between different building types?

 

On the other hand, if it really is the intent of USGBC to add arbitrary
additional internal heat loads to our models that our actual designs were
not designed and sized for, does it follow that we should allow the proposed
models to autosize cooling equipment/fan capacities and not specify them
(this would seem incongruous with 90.1 to me)?

Unfortunately the reviewer was incorrect in their interpretation for that
review.  GBCI is working hard to ensure a higher level of consistency in
LEED reviews.  The change from the Certification Bodies method to bringing
reviews in-house at GBCI should go a long way to achieving better
consistency.

 

Also while it does appear that the 25% is being calculated based on energy
use, we have been assured by the author of the form that it is indeed being
calculated based on cost.

Hi Nick,

I'm glad you raised this issue. 

First, I agree with James, and have heard from other people, that LEED
accepts documentation saying something as basic as "hey, I don't have 25%
plug loads".

Second, when you have to create a baseline to measure up from, you are
forced to say what that baseline is. For instance, in 1985-86, working on
the BPA-funded Energy Edge project, we had to figure out the baseline for a
group of buildings being designed to exceed the current energy codes by 30%.
We didn't have a baseline then. To deal with this we assembled a group of
people that we euphemistically called The Greybeards (so sorry to you all).
The tables now known as G3.1.1A & G3.1.1B in Standard 90 came out of what we
created in that moment of time. We were trying to limit what is called
"gaming the system"

So now it seems it has been deemed important to control the baseline a
little more: by specifying plug loads at 25%. The goal of trying to limit
gaming the system might be the source of the 25%. The danger which Nick has
clearly demonstrated in his email is that what is meant to control gaming
the system, may now actually be creating it.

Further thoughts/comments welcome,

Carol

This is a good question.  On prior projects we have worked on, I have found
that you can have less than 25% plug loads, so long as you have some
documentation to back it up.

 

For example, we are currently working on a prison project.  The plug loads
are very low for obvious reasons; they don?t provide stereos, computers,
ipods, TV?s, etc. to the inmates (typically, all they get is an alarm
clock/radio that uses ~ < 10 watts).  There is no way on this project that
we could get the plug loads to come in at 25% unless we artificially jacked
them up to levels that would never exist in reality.  We would have a
similar problem in that the Proposed Design equipment would not be able to
cool the spaces.  So, we just document the loads we do have and I believe we
are good.  The project has been through the 1st review and this has not come
up as an issue.  

 

I believe we have had other projects where we documented the loads we had
and passed the review with no problems.  We will typically develop a simple
spreadsheet and document the internal loads that each room has.  That is
easy enough to do these days I believe, for most applications.  For example,
a typical desktop computer uses about 65 watts on average, monitor = ~ 45
watts (depending on size), clock radio ~ 10 to 15 watts, etc. you get the
point.  (get a ?Killawatt? power meter from Amazon and have some fun taking
some measurements to see approximately how much power stuff uses, guaranteed
to provide hours of fun).

 

Just provide some documentation on some good reasonable estimates for the
loads and I think you will be fine.

 

An alternate method is to use default values from Table G-B from the ASHRAE
90.1-2007 Users Manual.

 

For example, the Receptacle Power Density for the Office Building Type is
0.75 watts/SF per Table G-5.

 

If using that value results in the process loads being less than 25%, my
comment to the reviewers would be that the 0.75 watts/SF is the value
determined by ASHRAE to be appropriate for the building type.

 

I think the most important thing is to use something reasonable and
defendable, and make it the same between the Baseline and Proposed Design
energy models.  Our experience indicates that it does not have to be exactly
25%, can be less than 25% or greater than 25%, depending on the building.

 

One thing that is interesting is that on federal projects, per EPACT
requirements, you do not have to factor in the process/recep loads for the
purpose of determining whether the 30% savings requirement has been met.
That makes it easier to show 30% savings.  

 

Thanks!

Subject: [Bldg-rate] LEED+90.1 Process/Plug Loads Conundrum

 

Something new occurred to me this week and I?d love to hear others?
thoughts!

 

LEED prescribes baseline/proposed energy models to follow ASHRAE 90.1 with a
caveat:  the ?process energy costs? must total 25% of the baseline energy
costs.  By extension, 90.1 requires the same loads/schedules be applied to
the proposed model as they have to match.  As an aside, the LEED EAc1
templates appear to calculate/check this using process energy consumption
(not cost), but that?s not what I?m getting at?

 

I just had a typical case where I had to inflate the baseline internal
miscellaneous equipment loads to get to 25%.  These additional loads were
substantial enough that when applied to the proposed model/design, I ran
into many unmet cooling hours for the equipment capacities entered.  

 

Then I realized:  We can define additional equipment electricity loads but
simultaneously apply a multiplier (in eQuest anyway ? I expect this is
feasible other programs also) to reduce/negate the corresponding heat load
contributions.  This results in the energy consumption/costs showing up
correctly in the final results/reports, but does not artificially inflate
the internal loads that the baseline/proposed systems must handle.

 

Would this practice (which incidentally can be a time saver) of accounting
for extra process/miscellaneous loads without extra thermal contributions be
in line with the intent of ASHRAE/USGBC?  It would still normalize the
otherwise unstandardized process consumption/costs of the baseline/proposed
models between different building types?

 

On the other hand, if it really is the intent of USGBC to add arbitrary
additional internal heat loads to our models that our actual designs were
not designed and sized for, does it follow that we should allow the proposed
models to autosize cooling equipment/fan capacities and not specify them
(this would seem incongruous with 90.1 to me)?

About  IES <Virtual Environment>

 

The IES <Virtual Environment> offers detailed, comprehensive, and
integrated dynamic simulation of daylighting, thermal loads, HVAC
systems, controls, and building energy performance. With the VE-Pro
applications, users can take a project from climate analysis and
schematic 3D modeling through initial assessments of daylighting,
energy, and carbon footprint and on to advanced daylighting analysis,
detailed thermal-comfort and loads analysis for critical spaces, and
finally to whole-building energy modeling and reporting for the
LEED/ASHRAE-90.1 Performance Rating Method. 

Fully integrated building and systems modeling capabilities range from
natural ventilation, mixed-mode operation, and controls to detailed
modeling of conventional and non-standard systems and configurations.
These include customizable CV and VAV systems, underfloor air
distribution (UFAD), displacement ventilation (DV), indirect-direct
evaporative cooling (IDDE), dedicated outside air systems (DOAS),
CO2-driven demand-controlled ventilation (DCV), radiant panels and
hydronic slabs, passive and active chilled beams, desiccant
dehumidification, double-skin facades, hot-water and chilled-water
plants, heat pumps, absorption chillers, waterside free cooling, and
much more.

	Cookbook
Message-ID: <2C3CF455489D6B4F95AFAB84847FA413D9E35862E1@E2K7-MS2.ds.strath.ac.uk>


The Energy Simulation Research Unit at the University of Strathclyde
are please to announce the arrival of a new Italian translation of the
ESP-r Cookbook on the ESRU web site <http://ww.strath.ac.uk/esru/> and
 <http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk/Programs/ESP-r.htm>

This work was done by Gian Luca Brunetti of Politecnico di Milano and joins the existing English,
and Korea versions of the Cookbook.

And those that use other simulation tools (and who prefer Italian) will be interested
in this document because it contains chapters focused on the design of models,
model quality assurance and simulation team working practices.

Regards, Jon Hand (the guy who wrote the original ESP-r Cookbook), Glasgow Scotland

I do not believe we are double discounting. Try this: think of when you turn
your computer on and off however you do so during the day, lets say on at 9
am off at noon on at 1 pm off at 5 pm. That is your schedule. Now think of
how when you walk away from your computer for any length of time and it goes
into sleep mode, that's your diversity.

Comments, thoughts are welcome. Is this what you were maybe getting at with
the multiplier, Nick.

Waiting to learn more,

1) How about an excessively low discharge air temp (assuming that you have a
reheat coil) 
2) a site in the Sahara desert ;)
3) a corrupt weather file?
4  I know those weren't too helpful, but it seems that an energy modeler is
always solving a similar mystery.

Subject: Re: [Equest-users] Process Equipment Power Consumption

Hi Omer,

On recent projects, I have had to pay more attention to the process loads for the types of equipment you mentioned below.  In the past, I would just ensure that my process energy cost was 25% of the total energy cost because I knew that the types of buildings I was modeling (commercial offices, mostly) would never have an actual process load even close to 25%.

However, recently I have been modeling process loads in a more exact way. What I do is I take the kW rating of the equipment, then I talk to the electrical engineer to get an idea of whether that equipment will ever run at its rated load and, if not, I apply the appropriate reduction to it based on what the electrical engineer says.

Once I have this maximum energy use for process loads in the building, I then create a custom schedule for this process energy.  Sometimes I need to create more than one custom schedule based on the type of equipment in the space.  This can become very tedious if you get too far into the weeds, so I try to keep the schedules realistic, but simple and I keep the number of different custom schedules I create to a minimum.  As we all know, you can never know the actual occupancy and use schedule of a building until it is occupied for a certain period of time, so keep your assumptions simple and logical.

I'd love to hear what other folks are doing if it differs from my process.

Dear All,

One of the things that cause most trouble for us in modelling is the power
consumption of equipment such as dishwashers, ovens, food warm-up
equipment and so on that have varying levels of power consumption during
operation (even PCs and laptops). We are sometimes using nameplate
installed kW values, but deep inside we know that this is quite wrong -
but we have no other more reliable source / guideline for such equipment.
I would appreciate any feedbacks on how others are modelling such
equipment.

Thank you,

Carol et al,

 

Here's my current understanding of the options we have (specifically in
eQuest) to specify equipment loads (from my head - correct me if I'm
off):

-          You may enter one (optionally, up to 5) distinct W/SF or kW
value for a zone to represent the full equipment load(s).  You may
optionally apply a diversity to the full load at this step here, but if
doing so you should modify your operation schedules as follows...

-          Each equipment load specified must be assigned a fractional
schedule.  You may choose to use 0's and 1's to model ON/OFF behavior,
but eQuest left to its own devices generates hourly schedules which
apply such diversity here.

-          The hourly thermal effects of each specified equipment load
may be reduced further by means of specifying the sensible and latent
load factors - values from 0 to 1.  By default, I believe equipment
loads generated by the wizards will have whatever you may have specified
for sensible (1.0 by default) and 0.0 for the latent portion.  The sum
of these two factors cannot exceed 1.0, and these factors have no effect
on the amount of energy consumed - only the heat contributions.

 

 

In the referenced and on-going (?) thread (discussing the intent and
means of handling/satisfying the LEED 25% default process load rule) I
brought up the possibility of specifying additional equipment loads with
a sensible/latent fraction of 0.0 - effectively consuming additional
energy to reach the 25% mandate, but also contributing nothing to
internal heat gains.  It was suggested, and I'm currently in agreement,
that an easier and less seemingly subversive approach to meeting the 25%
rule and achieving the same intentions would be to instead specify a
direct internal load to the electric meter.  It should be noted some
feel strongly that the 25% rule itself ought to be ignored entirely, but
if this topic interests you I'd suggest replying to that discussion
thread for clarity's sake ;).

I do not believe we are double discounting. Try this: think of when you
turn your computer on and off however you do so during the day, lets say
on at 9 am off at noon on at 1 pm off at 5 pm. That is your schedule.
Now think of how when you walk away from your computer for any length of
time and it goes into sleep mode, that's your diversity. 

Comments, thoughts are welcome. Is this what you were maybe getting at
with the multiplier, Nick.

Waiting to learn more,
Carol

Hi Carol,

This question is not specific to equest. Would you apply a diversity as
well as a schedule for process load? I thought by applying a schedule we
are accounting for diversity. By applying a diversity and then a
schedule are we not double discounting the load?

Regards,

Yuvaraj

Whenever you have an equipment, aka process, load it is proper to apply
first a diversity factor, aka % on at one time, and then a schedule.
Whether your building is new or existing doesn't matter. This is an Art
not a Science. Experience is the primary teacher. You can always ask us
old farts. We are relevant and have information that one only can get
with time. Yours to chose to listen to or not.

Peace out,
Carol

	Hi Omer,
	
	On recent projects, I have had to pay more attention to the
process loads for the types of equipment you mentioned below.  In the
past, I would just ensure that my process energy cost was 25% of the
total energy cost because I knew that the types of buildings I was
modeling (commercial offices, mostly) would never have an actual process
load even close to 25%.
	
	However, recently I have been modeling process loads in a more
exact way. What I do is I take the kW rating of the equipment, then I
talk to the electrical engineer to get an idea of whether that equipment
will ever run at its rated load and, if not, I apply the appropriate
reduction to it based on what the electrical engineer says.
	
	Once I have this maximum energy use for process loads in the
building, I then create a custom schedule for this process energy.
Sometimes I need to create more than one custom schedule based on the
type of equipment in the space.  This can become very tedious if you get
too far into the weeds, so I try to keep the schedules realistic, but
simple and I keep the number of different custom schedules I create to a
minimum.  As we all know, you can never know the actual occupancy and
use schedule of a building until it is occupied for a certain period of
time, so keep your assumptions simple and logical.
	
	I'd love to hear what other folks are doing if it differs from
my process.

	Dear All,
	
	One of the things that cause most trouble for us in modelling is
the power
	consumption of equipment such as dishwashers, ovens, food
warm-up
	equipment and so on that have varying levels of power
consumption during
	operation (even PCs and laptops). We are sometimes using
nameplate

wrong -

	I would appreciate any feedbacks on how others are modelling
such

So sorry! The user is the only one who accounts for anything.
DOE2/eQUEST/EnergyPlus are all just tools. The schedules found in DOE2 are
just *advice and suggestions.* (user beware! GIGO can happen). We the
modelers, and Demba, I mean you no disrespect at all, are responsible to
review and revise these suggestions.

I am so outdated, I remember when we had to create each and every schedule
on our own in BDL. Now that would be an energy modeling competition I'd be
interested in IBPSA.

Love to all,
Carol

I agree with Austin. All of these are resources for us that can be used
along with good judgment, sound engineering practices, and any available
real information. We just have to remember that we are the users and the
model is just a model.

Hi Omer,

On recent projects, I have had to pay more attention to the process loads for the types of equipment you mentioned below.  In the past, I would just ensure that my process energy cost was 25% of the total energy cost because I knew that the types of buildings I was modeling (commercial offices, mostly) would never have an actual process load even close to 25%.

However, recently I have been modeling process loads in a more exact way. What I do is I take the kW rating of the equipment, then I talk to the electrical engineer to get an idea of whether that equipment will ever run at its rated load and, if not, I apply the appropriate reduction to it based on what the electrical engineer says.

Once I have this maximum energy use for process loads in the building, I then create a custom schedule for this process energy.  Sometimes I need to create more than one custom schedule based on the type of equipment in the space.  This can become very tedious if you get too far into the weeds, so I try to keep the schedules realistic, but simple and I keep the number of different custom schedules I create to a minimum.  As we all know, you can never know the actual occupancy and use schedule of a building until it is occupied for a certain period of time, so keep your assumptions simple and logical.

I'd love to hear what other folks are doing if it differs from my process.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] modeling chilled beams in eQuest
Message-ID: <20100506052221.D8D844800C@diego.dreamhost.com>

Dear friends,

 

I am modeling the active chilled beams system using an induction unit. I
have created a separate treated outside air system (TOAS) from where the
fresh air would be supplied to 

the induction unit. I have hard coded the fresh air requirement for each
zone at the outdoor air CFM field under outside air tab as well as under
design flow cfm field under air flow tab

so that the only the fresh air requirement is supplied to the zone. The
cooling will be done by chilled beams modeled as induction unit.

 

when I see the simulation report the amount of fan energy consumed is huge
which is nearly about 20% percent of the overall energy consumption.

So then I zeroed out the fan energy i.e kW/CFM for fans =0 and only the TOAS
has the fan energy but the fan energy consumption decreased very little.

I have no other source in the model for which the fan energy could be
accountable for.

 

Can anyone please tell what can be the reason for this or if I am missing
out on something? 

Am I modeling the system right? How is the fan energy for this system to be
modeled?

Vishnu,
I am not sure I completely follow what you did but perhaps you are not aware
that the induction unit system includes a central fan for pretreating
outside air delivered to the induction units. So if you used the "outside
air from sys" approach,the central fan of the induction unit would still be
modeled with its default parameters. Also, if you don't set the induction
ratio high enough (e.g. default is 3, max value is 10), you will get return
air mixing with your supply (e.g it will no longer be 100% OA), which will
make your supply air flow higher. This will increase your fan energy use as
well.

I don't think the eQUEST documentation includes a description of the
induction unit system (TPIU or FPIU) but its relevant keywords can found in
the DOE2.1E BDL Summary. You could also insert the following commands in
your input file.

DIAGNOSTICS  DEFAULTS ..   $ before the SYSTEM command and
DIAGNOSTICS  CAUTIONS ..    $ after the SYSTEM command

Adding the above will show in the BDL file the value for all keywords not
explicitly listed but with default values being used.

The other thing at work here is that the Induction units and the DOAS are
constant volume, so you're going to pay a fan energy penalty for this - so
first, make sure you only have one zone per Induction unit in eQUEST.  In
real life, the DOAS can send variables amounts of air (based on load) to
chilled beams, but this can't be modeled with the Dummy zone/DOAS approach.
If you change the system type to a Power Induction Unit (which is a VAV) and
you zero out the fan power, this might work.

There is no induction ratio parameter then, but I have played around with
that parameter in eQUEST and seen almost no impact from varying it.

I am attempting to modeling an active chilled beam system served by a VAV
DOAS right now, so if anyone else has comments on the Power Induction Unit
approach, please let me know!

Kendra,
?
I don't think the PIU approach is really the same -?for one you are not modelling the cooling at the zonal level with chilled water like a chilled beam works. 
?
I haven't modeled a chilled beam with a VAV supply before - mostly because in the projects I've used chilled beams (labs)?you restrict the supply to only ventilation air which is a constant set normally to around 6ACH. Have you tried using the Induction unit and assigning a schedule to the fresh air? I think you can vary the amount of outside air to each zone that way. 
?
Vishnu - if this is a lab building 20% for fan energy is not completely out of the question. Couple of things to check:
?
1. When you come out of th eQUEST wizard the fan energy tab is normally described in terms of static pressure and not kW/cfm. Make sure you set those to default to activate the kW/cfm. You might have already done this because the kW/cfm option generally doesn't show up unless you do this.
2. to check if the fan energy is coming from your DOAS - try zeroing out the fan energy on the DOAS and see if that reduces your fan contribution. That way at least ?you'll know if your barking up the right tree. 
3. If this is a lab, make sure you model your exhaust correctly. While Chilled beam systems don't use fan energy on the supply side, the labs will use fans on the exhust side. These will need to be captured on the zonal exhaust level. 
4. Unless your supplying air neutral from the DOAS, you will need to capture the cooling effects of the supply air (Kendra - this is where it gets tricky for a VAV supply). 
?
Hope this helps

The other thing at work here is that the Induction units and the DOAS are constant volume, so you're going to pay a fan energy penalty for this - so first, make sure you only have one zone per Induction unit in eQUEST.? In real life, the DOAS can send variables amounts of air (based on load) to chilled beams, but this can't be modeled with the Dummy zone/DOAS approach. If you change the system type to a Power Induction Unit (which is a VAV) and you zero out the fan power, this might work.

This will increase your fan energy use as well. 

I don't think the eQUEST documentation includes a description of the induction unit system (TPIU or FPIU) but its relevant keywords can found in the DOE2.1E BDL Summary. You could also insert the following commands in your input file.

DIAGNOSTICS? DEFAULTS ..?? $ before the SYSTEM command and
DIAGNOSTICS? CAUTIONS ..??? $ after the SYSTEM command

Adding the above will show in the BDL file the value for all keywords not explicitly listed but with default values being used.

Oh, I know its not the same - I just couldn't come up with anything that
solved both problems! Trading one evil for another I suppose.....

This is an active chilled beam system in an office building, so the outside
air supply is varying based on cooling load and CO2 sensors - the mechanical
engineer is used VSD ECM motor series FPBs to modulate the outside air
delivered to the chilled beams at the zone level. so it would be impossible
to manually schedule the outside air according to load (that's why we're
using an energy model!). Modeling constant volume induction units conditions
far more outside air than in the actual design, so I figured it might be
more important to account for this, vs the chilled beam cooling at the zone
level.

Seems like remote source chilled water would be treated like purchased
heat under G3.1.1.1, where you would come up with an equivalent cost
rate based on how the remote central chiller plant is purchasing energy
and all other efficiencies related to producing chilled water and
pumping to your building.  Then you would have to use that rate in both
baseline and proposed buildings, similar to an electric or gas rate.
This is just my guess, anyone else have an idea from Bldg-Sim mailing
list?

 

So to answer your original question in HAP, you would choose remote
source chilled water, the same as proposed building, with same cost
rate, then change all baseline cooling  to chilled water under each of
your systems.  This will essentially make chiller water "cost neutral"
and not give you an opportunity to improve in cooling efficiency over
the baseline building.  

 

I came across this document which may be helpful as well

Subject: [Hap-users] Baseline Plant Type

 

Hello users,

 

I am modeling a residential baseline building according to ASHRAE 90.1
where I have packaged DX Fan coil units in the zones. In HAP4.4 when I
define a plant for this system what should I choose under the plant type
as indicated below? My proposed building is remote source chilled water.


 

I appreciate any help.

Dear,

I'm looking for examples and analyses (including LCA) of energy autarky
buildings. As I want to see the differences in design as a function of the
climate, the examples may be fom anywhere. There seems not to be that much
of literature on the subject, so any nice reference is welcome too!

Hi Leen!

 

I had to look this up on Wikipedia, so it's my word of the day:
"Autarky is the quality of being self-sufficient."

 

There are many loose terms thrown around here in the states for
"self-sufficient" buildings - these terms may help your search depending
on what exactly you're looking for:

-          "net-zero" buildings - this may imply one of a few things add
up to zero over time:

o   Energy Consumption (sometimes isolated services - i.e. electricity
but not gas)

o   Carbon Emissions - see also "Carbon Neutral" in the context of the
2030 Challenge

o   Cost - the cost of purchased energy is balanced by the sale of
site-generated energy

-          "zero-energy" buildings theoretically produce/harvest all
energy on-site without needing to tie to a utility grid.  I'm not
intimately familiar, but a number of zero-energy building design
challenges exist in the academic world - you may find a lot of
information from competition entries if that's what you're looking for
and such information is archived somewhere.  Zero-energy may also refer
to "source" energy (meaning the energy harvested/generated on site meets
a higher bar of energy to include losses of transmission/generation),
but I've yet to see that applied to a real project.

-          "off-the-grid" buildings - similar to "zero-energy" but
literally off the utility service grid.

 

Because these are largely unregulated marketing/PR labels, any of the
above interpretations may be "bent" to meet the needs of the moment.
For example, you may find a building may be claimed "zero-energy," but
in reality it only functions in that state for limited periods during
the year when the wind blows.

 

Sorry for not providing any specific examples, but cautioning that you
carefully define what you mean by autarky buildings - lest you get
swamped with information that isn't what you're looking for!

 

~Nick

Hi,

it is the off-the-grid version I'm looking at. I found a few of them, but
generally in a warm and sunny climate. So I want to see the
differences/feasability building it in a moderate to cold climate.

Dear Folks.

 

As we know that the minimum two points are mandatory for projects registered
after June 26, 2007 which is 14% for new construction type in Core & Shell.

 

As per my understanding, to achieve minimum two points 14% savings vis-a-vis
Whole Building Load is required but recently there has been a change and we
found information (attached) and a excel spreadsheet tool which shows that
to achieve the minimum two point, 14% savings of Core & Shell Building Load
is required and minimum in our case two points can be achieved by only 5%
savings of whole building load if 25% of Energy Cost Influenced or Directly
Controlled by CS Owner/Developer. 

 

Thus, can someone please confirm that if we achieved the 5% savings of Whole
Building Load then we qualify as per this new info?

 

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Hi Ashu,

Yes, if 25% is the total energy used by the system that are owned,
installed, and/or operated by the developer, 5% of the whole  building
savings will qualify.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Simulating Occupancy Sensors
Message-ID: <AANLkTilEs49g2OaKYQ5Yj9dFCqJbxzBcQxnqYQXvCpKE@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I am trying to simulate an energy model (Baseline and Proposed) for a LEED
project. I understand that exceptional lighting controls could be used for
energy savings in Proposed model. I was wondering if I could use the
lighting schedule as 7:30 to 5:30 on weekdays as 100% in the baseline and
then change the lighting schedule to match the occupancy schedule for
simulating with occupancy sensors? Is that a acceptable approach. Please
advise.

Appendix G allows a certain prescribed lighting reduction allowance for
occupancy sensors.  I believe it is 10-15% of lighting power, depending on
the building.  You can put the reduction in the schedule or in the lighting
power.  If I have some spaces with occupancy sensors, and some without, I
usually reduce the lighting power and use the same schedule.

Christian,
   Just for clarity, there is a TRNSYS TMY format that is fairly old and 
out of date. It consists of the five or so pieces of data from the 
original TMY (version 1) files that were made available by NREL; the 
idea was to keep the file size small. TRNSYS also reads the standard 
TMY, TMY2, and TMY3 formats. I imagine that what you are looking for is 
a translator for *.TM2 (TMY version 2) files to *.EPW format? If so, 
there is a good archive at

http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/weatherdata_sources.cfm

Best,
   David

Hi all;

If I specify only 1 zone with multiple spaces for a high accuracy residential home model,
can I still specify precise equipment loads for each space appliance by appliance?

Also, can you define the footprint of the spaces in the DD wizard or is that done through the detailed interface?

thanks,

I also found some formulas when tooling around in the archives the other day and could love to get comments, if any about their utlity:

EIR=(1/EER-0.012167)/((1/3.413)+0.012167)
and
EIR=((1/SEER*0.778+1.4)-0.012167)/((1/3.413)+0.012167)

Anyone remember these that knows the source and utility? Is there one for HSPF?

Hi Michael, to modify the EIR (which is in Btu/Btu) in the detailed mode, click on the Air-Side HVAC icon at the top of your screen, then double click on the heat pump. Under the cooling and heating tabs you will find a Unitary Power tab where you can change your EIR.

Hi All,

I am still fairly new to equest and I am having a bit of trouble with setting up my HVAC.  I created a building model using the equest wizard and now I have made a number of changes within the detailed DOE2 interface.  The building uses air source heat pumps for the HVAC and I would like to change the EER/COP values without going back to the wizard, but I cannot figure where these values are stored.  Is there an easy way to make changes like that within DOE2?

Thanks,
Michael Shields

Hi,
I am working with natural ventilation in DesignBuilder.? In another program (CoolVent)?I calculated varying ACH due to wind and stack effect.? I made a schedule and input it into DesignBuilder. The problem is, I would like DesignBuilder to both use my schedule of air changes AND close the windows when it gets too cold outside.? However, it seems that I can either be in Scheduled or Calculated mode.? Scheduled mode will use my ACH schedule, and Calculated mode will close the windows when it's too cold.? It seems I can't make DesignBuilder take both into account.? Am I missing something?? Thanks!
Holly

Hi Jacob!

 

1.       Yes.  Each space may be assigned distinct and separate
equipment load(s) and schedule(s).  Zones are simply spaces or groups of
spaces, and they exist for assignment to HVAC systems.

 

2.       You can and probably should define the footprint of all of your
spaces in the DD wizard.  Draw out the shell and spaces using shared
single lines for your CAD reference.  Initially trace out and define
each space as a "zone," and later in the wizard shell screens you can
tie them all together so they'll all be a single zone upon exiting the
wizards and entering detailed mode.  If you should miss that step it's
also easy to reassign defined spaces into a single zone once in
detailed, but you'd have additional sets of wizard-generated schedules
to work around.  If you have multiple shells whose spaces you wish to
tie together, I think you will have to do that in detailed mode.

 

3.       Well worded questions, by the way!

Hi all;

 

If I specify only 1 zone with multiple spaces for a high accuracy
residential home model,

can I still specify precise equipment loads for each space appliance by
appliance?

 

Also, can you define the footprint of the spaces in the DD wizard or is
that done through the detailed interface?

 

thanks,

I also found some formulas when tooling around in the archives the other day and could love to get comments, if any about their utlity:

EIR=(1/EER-0.012167)/((1/3.413)+0.012167)
and
EIR=((1/SEER*0.778+1.4)-0.012167)/((1/3.413)+0.012167)

Anyone remember these that knows the source and utility? Is there one for HSPF?

Hi Michael, to modify the EIR (which is in Btu/Btu) in the detailed mode, click on the Air-Side HVAC icon at the top of your screen, then double click on the heat pump. Under the cooling and heating tabs you will find a Unitary Power tab where you can change your EIR.

Hi All,

 

I am still fairly new to equest and I am having a bit of trouble with setting up my HVAC.  I created a building model using the equest wizard and now I have made a number of changes within the detailed DOE2 interface.  The building uses air source heat pumps for the HVAC and I would like to change the EER/COP values without going back to the wizard, but I cannot figure where these values are stored.  Is there an easy way to make changes like that within DOE2?

 

Thanks,

Michael Shields

I didn't see Nicks answer last night or I'd have just gone to bed. However,
I have another thing that might help. Nick said "define each space as a
zone" which is confusing to some as it stands. They way I think of it for
clarity is "define each space as a thernal zone" which then gets assigned to
an HVAC zone. Might seem picky but in this work all clarity is good. Hope
you agree, Nick.

I agree 110%!  In this case, there's a method to the madness though...

 

My admittedly confusing wording stems from a minor wizard screen UI
quirk that I would suggest considering to address in future eQuest
releases:  

 

In the second DD shell wizard screen, a user may define a custom "shell"
and "zone" footprints (screenshot attached and below).  This screen can
be misleading to new users (as recently illustrated) by consistently use
the term "zone" when one is really more correctly defining "spaces."
Whether these spaces should end up being individual/distinct thermal
zones or tied together as a larger thermal zone(s) (i.e.
core/perimeter/custom) depends entirely on later wizard screens, wizard
system type selection and/or detailed mode user input.

 

While I'm sure this space/zone distinction has received an exhaustive
level of attention now for anyone following this conversation, it might
still help future new users and those of us trying to guide them if this
UI item could be polished out a bit further.

Holly,

 

If you use the scheduled mode you should be alright in doing roughly what
you want it to do using the scheduled air flow rates.

 

Essentially you need to set up the Nat Vent Set-Point Temperature on the
Activity tab and you'll see along with that you should have an option for
setting the Max In-Out Delta T.  This should allow you to set the model up
with your scheduled rates, but put a realistic setting in there which means
that natural ventilation will not occur if the Delta T is higher than say 5
deg C.  It means it won't bring in air that is too hot or too cold and will
only bring in as much as is possible with the Delta T that exists, etc.

 

Personally, I don't quite get why you don't just let the model calculate it
for you in calculated mode as I'd hope that way it should be more accurate
rather than trying to muddle together two separate calculations.
DesignBuilder can work out the stack/wind combined flow easily enough.

 

 Kind Regards

 

Paul

Hi,

I am working with natural ventilation in DesignBuilder.  In another program
(CoolVent) I calculated varying ACH due to wind and stack effect.  I made a
schedule and input it into DesignBuilder. The problem is, I would like
DesignBuilder to both use my schedule of air changes AND close the windows
when it gets too cold outside.  However, it seems that I can either be in
Scheduled or Calculated mode.  Scheduled mode will use my ACH schedule, and
Calculated mode will close the windows when it's too cold.  It seems I can't
make DesignBuilder take both into account.  Am I missing something?  Thanks!

Hi Holly,

First I should say that questions on DesignBuilder should ideally be addressed to either the DesignBuilder forum or our supportdesk.

>From what you say, it sounds like you should continue to use the DesignBuilder scheduled natural ventilation mechanism where you can specify the air change rate plus a schedule but ideally also make use of the EnergyPlus "ZoneVentilation > Minimum Outdoor Temperature" data as well. Unfortunately DB does not yet provide an interface to this, though it does allow you to specify "Max temperature difference for operation", i.e. the maximum temperature difference between inside and outside, but not min/max outside temperatures.

We plan to provide an interface to this extra ZoneVentilation data within DesignBuilder in a near future beta so, depending on your timescales, you could wait for that. If this is not practical then you can export to IDF and add the data there.

I am working with natural ventilation in DesignBuilder.  In another program (CoolVent) I calculated varying ACH due to wind and stack effect.  I made a schedule and input it into DesignBuilder. The problem is, I would like DesignBuilder to both use my schedule of air changes AND close the windows when it gets too cold outside.  However, it seems that I can either be in Scheduled or Calculated mode.  Scheduled mode will use my ACH schedule, and Calculated mode will close the windows when it's too cold.  It seems I can't make DesignBuilder take both into account.  Am I missing something?  Thanks!
Holly

Hi Jacob,

 

eQuest can handle PV but not in the wizards - All PV inputs are in the
detailed mode post-wizards.

 

As an aside, cross-posts to multiple mailing lists are loosely
discouraged.  Sometimes it makes sense for an announcement or if you
can't get a response in one group, but in many cases you end up with
multiple conversations to keep up with and it becomes difficult for both
the asker and answerers to follow the discussion ;).

 

~Nick

Yes to you Nick! So let's nest them. HVAC Sys One (aka the "HVAC Zone" or
the Parent HVAC system), has some Child thermal zones, e.g. TZ space 1 Zone,
TZ space 2 Zone, TZ space 3 Zone , etc., etc. (as many as you check) as
Children. These Thermal Zones are then Parents of the Child spaces: TZ space
1, TZ space 2, TZ space 3, etc., etc. So the Parent HVAC System (aka HVAC
zone by way of ASHRAE std 90, etc), has Child Thermal Zones, which are the
Parents of the Child Spaces. If you actively name your spaces, their zones,
and their HVAC systems, you might stand a chance of seeing the light of day.

Here's looking at you kids!!

Carol the PE in PDX

Don't ya think someone ought to pay me for this!?!

 I agree 110%!  In this case, there?s a method to the madness though?

Funny, I was going to send a similar email today.  Thanks Mahabir.

 

Just to fill you all in on some further details.  This is the course we have
delivered successfully a number times in Portugal, Brazil and in the UK now.

 

Whilst it is a course aimed at teaching the fundamentals in using the
DesignBuilder tool for energy analysis, existing and experienced EnergyPlus
users that have been on the previous courses have commented that it has been
worth attending particularly when they have gained the ability to make
models and visualise them much more easily using the DesignBuilder
interface.  Those models can then be adapted to carry out advanced analysis
in EnergyPlus directly something that Mahabir will briefly cover on the
final day of the course.

 

I will also be covering the CFD module on the final day of the course and so
for any users or people interested in using a good and cost effective CFD
tool to analyse room comfort conditions, then training on that module is
also included.  Hopefully some of those that attended my recent webinar on
linking the EnergyPlus simulation results to the CFD models might be
interested?

 

Oh yes, and of course you will get a certificate of attendance which you
should be able to count towards your professional development hours.

 

Hope to see some of you there.

Regards

Paul

Message-ID: <07186B30C3DFE948B0EE2862AC1999F70A5B87BA96@MAILBOX2.nrel.gov>

A new version (1.0.5.355) of OpenStudio is now available which fixes some minor issues reported by users after the last release (1.0.5.335):

http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/openstudio.cfm

Thanks to everyone who reported these issues.  Additionally, we are working to determine what new features should be included in the October release and would really love to get as much user feedback as possible.  If you would like to provide your input on the next steps for OpenStudio please take a few minutes to answers the questions up at:

http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/openstudio

Thanks a lot,
Dan
Changes in Patch 1.0.5.355

 *   Attached shading surfaces can now be manually assigned a base surface. By default the base surface is a floor in the zone, however you may need to change it to an exterior wall. EnergyPlus requires that shading surfaces have an exterior base surface.
 *   When "Reset to Default Office" is clicked in Zone Loads, "Constant Setpoint Thermostat" is now set for HVACTemplase:Thermostat. This is only visible if "HVAC Template:Aone:IdealLoadsAirSystem" is also turned on.
 *   When Zone Load Preferences are saved, the Thermostat is also saved along with Zone Loads.
 *   For Surface, Zone, and all Ground outside boundary conditions sun and wind exposure are now set to "NoSun" and "NoWind".
 *   For Outdoors, Adiabatic, Other Side Coefficients, and Other Side Conditions Model outside boundary conditions, the sun and wind exposure can manually be set. When choosing "Outdoors", exposures are set to "SunExposed" and "WindExposed" by default, but these can manually be changed.
 *   Fixed issues with conversion of Simple Objects to Detailed Objects.
 *   Units for summary reports can now be set under the "Run Simulation" dialog. This includes the Annual Building Utility Performance Summary.
 *   Added four IDF specific tutorials showing how to add and edit some IDF objects outside of OpenStudio. Batch simulation through EP-Launch, featured on tutorial 301, is currently not available for Mac OS.

Because I have been doing so many parametric runs I have tons of INP files
that have everything in them. I have similar back-ups that I could use but
unfortunately none from today, meaning I'd need to redo quite a bit.

 

Is there any way to create a BDL from an INP? 

 

The information seems like it's there, just not in the right format.
Primarily the BDL has specific references to curves that the INP does not
have, but all the curves in this model are defaults.

 

Any help is appreciated. 

 

Thanks.

 

Craig

I would suggest trying the following:

- start with a new, blank project file.  To do this, start a new project,
select a wizard (either SD or DD) then hit the red "x" instead of finish. 
That should put you in the detailed interface with a blank project.

- now simply "file import" one of the .inp files.

You will lose all the info in the .pd2 which is the original wizard data,
the CAD file link and the weather file setting (so you will need to
reselect the weather file).  However, all of your detailed interface data
should be there.

Your parametric run data is in a .prd text file so once your new file is
saved, you may be able to copy & rename the .prd to the new "project file
anme".prd and recover your parametric run info as well.

This has saved me quite a few times.

Good luck.

Worked perfectly. I just have to undo a few of the parametric changes from
the INP I used and it's ready to go.

 

It was definitely the BDL file that got messed up. It's related to the fact
that if you enter a value out of range in eQuest then choose the wrong
option in the warning message, eQuest deletes the item associated with the
error (not my favorite eQuest quirk). In this case the error applied to all
of my systems. So, eQuest deleted all of the systems and with them went all
zones and plant equipment. I opened the BDL in a text editor and it was
wiped clean from the end of the Building Shell section down.

 

Thanks for the tip Brian. I will definitely remember this trick.

 

Craig

I should add that the INP associated with the "Baseline Building" was wiped
out as well or I would not have needed to use one of the INPs for the
parametric runs.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] "Dynamic Radiance" and Radiance Terminology
Message-ID: <C8160786.10B5%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>

With apologies for cross-posting...

Greetings, all.

Following an entire week in Las Vegas for Lightfair 2010, I am delighted to be home, with wallet and liver both beat up a little bit, but largely intact. The end of the week, as many of you know, featured a new Daylight Symposium organized by Lisa Heshong. That I was invited to attend this event -- to be a part of the discussion that included many of the best and brightest minds in daylighting -- was an honor, and that is why I write this message with some trepidation, because I hope to not ruffle any feathers here. But I believe that the creation and subsequent misuse of the term "Dynamic Radiance" is leading us toward a blurred distinction between the tools and the techniques of climate-based daylight modeling (CBDM), and that this should be addressed.

As many of us know (and as John Mardaljevic pointed out the other week on radiance-online.org), daylight simulation is at an evolutionary crossroads. Core components of the Radiance toolkit have once again evolved, this time to support climate based daylight modeling (CBDM) in an efficient manner. The resultant new Radiance programs are largely the result of a support effort for the work being done by Lisa Heshong and Heshong Mahone Group (HMG) in support of the IESNA's Daylight Metrics Sub-Committee, and this work is being reported on a fair amount these days as the all the pieces of that important research come together. As a result, these new tools that were added to the Radiance toolbox, starting with rtcontrib and ending with all the recent tools developed to make rtcontrib usable by mortals (genklemsamp, dctimestep et al.), ended up getting a generic catch-all phrase for ease of use in discussion and in PowerPoint slides: "Dynamic Radiance".

With all due respect to Lisa Heshong, I respectfully submit my opposition to the use of this name for these new tools and processes. I understand the need to wrap the new developments into something linguistically tangible; Lisa was one of the first people to have to refer to these new tools in a meaningful way in papers and presentations (and I saw many over the last week and previously). But I would argue that the core tools rtcontrib, genklemsamp and dctimestep are merely the latest additions to that wonderful collection of programs (rpict, rtrace, and over seventy others) which already exists, and for the past two decades has been collectively called, cited, and referenced as, Radiance.

Many times over the course of the Daylight Symposium I heard phrases like "the 'new version' of Radiance", or "...used 'Dynamic Radiance' to calculate...". Maybe I'm being a semantics wonk here, but I do feel we are doing the simulation community a disservice by referring to these new additions to Radiance as a whole new thing, with a whole new name. Indeed, the foundational tool (rtcontrib) for the three-phase CBDM simulation paradigm was initially released five years ago. (!) Rtcontrib and the other new tools were formally released a month or so ago as Radiance v4.0, and I submit to you all that "Radiance Version Four" (Radiance v4.x) is what we should be referring to when we talk of using Radiance at the most basic, "bare metal", form, to perform daylight coefficient-based annual simulations -- with or without complex fenestration systems (CFS), user interactions, blinds, etc.

Were the tools in Radiance v4.x to be packaged in such a way as to be more easily used, either with a GUI or some sort of web-based frond end, that end result certainly would deserve and require a name like Dynamic Radiance, much like Desktop Radiance was a fitting title for the Windows/GUI project from LBNL, which was a stand-alone program that used Radiance. Today we have Daysim and SPOT and IESve that are also standalone software tools in their own right that use Radiance under the hood or behind the scenes or at its core or around the curtain or whatever phrase you like to use.

Applied in the traditional manner, so-called "Classic Radiance" refers to a single light-backwards raytracing step to solve for global illumination for a single point in time. So-called "Dynamic Radiance" is in actuality not a product or single tool, but the process of using the new Radiance tools to employ a three-phase approach to CBDM; we are still talking about a light-backwards step, albeit this time multiple light-backwards steps to build up matrices for applying BSDFs to simulate CFS in an annual daylighting simulation context. It's a change in process (and a very important addition in capability), but the tool is the same and should be called the same thing.

Radiance has a marvelous evolutionary history spanning two plus decades; tools, materials and geometry primitives have all been added to Radiance over the years to add functionality to the suite. Yes, some real game changing tools have recently been added to Radiance, but it's still Radiance. Let's call the tool what it really is (Radiance v4.x), and agree to another term(s) for the process. Currently, this process is known as the three-phase approach, but I'm sure we can come up with a more interesting/fun one, or five or six that we can all argue over.

Papers will be written and presentations will be given over the coming months and years that discuss this process and its underlying tools. Codes, standards and building rating systems will evolve, adopting these tools and methods as their agents of formulation and refinement, and for determining compliance. All I would like to see are some sensible definitions and usage here.

Respectfully,
Rob Guglielmetti

Hi All

1.There are interior wall on external walls shown in white color in 3 D Geometry view how do i ? avoid getting those interior wall.[pd2,inp,pdl files attached.]

2.How to stop the progress bar of BDL Load file form when opening a already saved project.

3.If the building footprint is having court yard in center of the building ,for "custom dwg" ,how do i trace the internal block? 


Thanking in advance for your reply.

 Regards,


Sanjay Cholekar

Yes, some real game changing tools have recently been added to Radiance, but it's still Radiance. Let's call the tool what it really is (Radiance v4.x), and agree to another term(s) for the process. Currently, this process is known as the three-phase approach, but I'm sure we can come up with a more interesting/fun one, or five or six that we can all argue over.
>   
Well, sorry for all the cross-postings. I fully agree with your 
argumentation. We should keep things clear. Radiance has been a tool to 
simulate radiative energy transfer, and that is probably why it is 
called Radiance. This has not changed.

Radiance has always been used with scripts, to achieve very different 
goals. Thas has not changed neither, so Radiance always supported 
dynamic simulations, whatever that means.

People have been using Radiance with different sky models, and support 
for these has evolved. First, everyone was using gensky. This tool 
allows to generate a sky model only from choosing one of the old 5 CIE 
skies, location and time. Then, others included weather data on its 
lowest level by providing measured irradiance or radiance to gensky, 
which is able to consider these. Others developed other tools to include 
different sky models. And finally, what has become very popular these 
days, people use patch-based models of skies to simplify e.g. 
time-series over a full day, month or even year. Especially support for 
these has been improved in recent versions, over the last years.

So - Radiance is in version 4 now, and with every release new tools or 
features were included to improve support for the applications that 
seamed to be most interesting for the community. This does not match the 
naming schemes of commercial software, where companies love to simply 
rename an application from time to time to attract some interest or 
because someone thinks that one of the recent developments is so great 
to stamp a new label on it. For Radiance, I doubt this to be helpful. It 
is a generic simulation tool for a domain that has not changed since the 
first release. And clearness and transparency are a must in its 
application and support. So I would encourage people to be specific when 
naming it - give the version, and spell the application. What is wrong 
about doing weather-data based light simulation and reference Radiance 
4.1.4 later as the tool used?

Best regards,

Lars O. Grobe.

Thanks Rob,
If it's any help, the "Dynamic" in Dynamic Thermal Simulation refers to 
the handling of transients and distinguishes the analysis from steady 
state calculations. I don't believe lighting analysis handles transients 
so it may be misleading - just my opinion.

The end of the week, as many of you know, featured a new Daylight Symposium organized by Lisa Heshong. That I was invited to attend this event -- to be a part of the discussion that included many of the best and brightest minds in daylighting -- was an honor, and that is why I write this message with some trepidation, because I hope to not ruffle any feathers here. But I believe that the creation and subsequent misuse of the term "Dynamic Radiance" is leading us toward a blurred distinction between the tools and the techniques of climate-based daylight modeling (CBDM), and that this should be addressed.

Core components of the Radiance toolkit have once again evolved, this time to support climate based daylight modeling (CBDM) in an efficient manner. The resultant new Radiance programs are largely the result of a support effort for the work being done by Lisa Heshong and Heshong Mahone Group (HMG) in support of the IESNA's Daylight Metrics Sub-Committee, and this work is being reported on a fair amount these days as the all the pieces of that important research come together. As a result, these new tools that were added to the Radiance toolbox, starting with rtcontrib and ending with all the recent tools developed to make rtcontrib usable by mortals (genklemsamp, dctimestep et al.), ended up getting a generic catch-all phrase for ease of use in discussion and in PowerPoint slides: "Dynamic Radiance".
>
> With all due respect to Lisa Heshong, I respectfully submit my opposition to the use of this name for these new tools and processes. I understand the need to wrap the new developments into something linguistically tangible; Lisa was one of the first people to have to refer to these new tools in a meaningful way in papers and presentations (and I saw many over the last week and previously). But I would argue that the core tools rtcontrib, genklemsamp and dctimestep are merely the latest additions to that wonderful collection of programs (rpict, rtrace, and over seventy others) which already exists, and for the past two decades has been collectively called, cited, and referenced as, Radiance.
>
> Many times over the course of the Daylight Symposium I heard phrases like "the 'new version' of Radiance", or "...used 'Dynamic Radiance' to calculate...". Maybe I'm being a semantics wonk here, but I do feel we are doing the simulation community a disservice by referring to these new additions to Radiance as a whole new thing, with a whole new name. Indeed, the foundational tool (rtcontrib) for the three-phase CBDM simulation paradigm was initially released five years ago. (!) Rtcontrib and the other new tools were formally released a month or so ago as Radiance v4.0, and I submit to you all that "Radiance Version Four" (Radiance v4.x) is what we should be referring to when we talk of using Radiance at the most basic, "bare metal", form, to perform daylight coefficient-based annual simulations -- with or without complex fenestration systems (CFS), user interactions, blinds, etc.
>
> Were the tools in Radiance v4.x to be packaged in such a way as to be more easily used, either with a GUI or some sort of web-based frond end, that end result certainly would deserve and require a name like Dynamic Radiance, much like Desktop Radiance was a fitting title for the Windows/GUI project from LBNL, which was a stand-alone program that used Radiance. Today we have Daysim and SPOT and IESve that are also standalone software tools in their own right that use Radiance under the hood or behind the scenes or at its core or around the curtain or whatever phrase you like to use.
>
> Applied in the traditional manner, so-called "Classic Radiance" refers to a single light-backwards raytracing step to solve for global illumination for a single point in time. So-called "Dynamic Radiance" is in actuality not a product or single tool, but the process of using the new Radiance tools to employ a three-phase approach to CBDM; we are still talking about a light-backwards step, albeit this time multiple light-backwards steps to build up matrices for applying BSDFs to simulate CFS in an annual daylighting simulation context. It's a change in process (and a very important addition in capability), but the tool is the same and should be called the same thing.

Message-ID: <078AC5207CEDE145A8C7C74FFB3975A0A600C7@DALEXC1.shwgroup.com>

Hello, everyone.

 

I've got a question that I've never been clear on and figured I'd turn
to the experts (you all).

 

In appendix G, Table G3.1.1b, it's stated that all conditioned spaces
shall be modeled as being both heated and cooled, even if no cooling
systems exists, for both the proposed and baseline buildings.

 

We typically place Cabinet Unit Heaters in stairways and vestibules, and
don't worry about cooling those spaces.  So, my question is, though
TRACE has a couple "Heating only" systems options, Appendix G says that
these cannot be selected.  So, what is a common solution?  The other
systems in the building are VAV, so, can those spaces just be grouped on
to there?

 

Thanks for any advice you'd have!

What I did in Trace....

I have a mechanical room which I was going to cooled with exhaust fans and no
mechanical cooling.  To do this, I set the infiltration equal to the exhaust
cfm in the Airflows tab.  I then set the infiltration schedule and exhaust
schedule to be 100% whenever the mechanical room temp was above 80 degrees.
(You will have to create a schedule.)

Modeling the exhaust cooling as infiltration worked best since the air
travels from the outside directly to the room without going through any
mechanical divice. (Coils, filters, fans....)  

I also made a coiling unit can called it "pretend" and had the set point 100
degrees.  (So it would never turn on.

..... I then made the baseline without the exhaust system, so it would have
to mechanically cool the mechanical room to 100 degrees.

Marty,
 
I usually model heating-only systems in my proposed model as PTAC systems for
Appendix G. I use a high cooling thermostat temperature in the proposed and
baseline models to minimize cooling energy in those spaces.

In my past experience, I had assigned those heated only spaces to VAV systems
for the baseline model. I think that's the most appropriate way of complying
Appendix G. And this way it went through without any comments from the
reviewer.

Hello, everyone.
 
I've got a question that I've never been clear on and figured I'd turn to the
experts (you all).
 
In appendix G, Table G3.1.1b, it's stated that all conditioned spaces shall
be modeled as being both heated and cooled, even if no cooling systems
exists, for both the proposed and baseline buildings.
 
We typically place Cabinet Unit Heaters in stairways and vestibules, and
don't worry about cooling those spaces.  So, my question is, though TRACE has
a couple "Heating only" systems options, Appendix G says that these cannot be
selected.  So, what is a common solution?  The other systems in the building
are VAV, so, can those spaces just be grouped on to there?
 
Thanks for any advice you'd have!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] EAc1 Existing Building Model
Message-ID: <7A93DB67D9AE2741BFF49B33EED6FB3D11ABEDEC@email.kling.us>

I have done my best to read through the BLDG-SIM archive as well as AppG
and the LEED CIRs. I know this topic has been covered extensively but
for my own piece of mind I need the advice of the group.

 

I have a building that half the floors HVAC are being renovated, half
are to remain as is. Building shell is untouched, but a safety over
cladding is being added to the exterior. Plant is new chillers and old
boiler to remain.

 

Here is my interpretation from 90.1, LEED NC2.2 and CIRs from 20081210 &
20090209, and is assumed that the whole building must be modeled since
all areas feed of the same building central plant.

 

Envelope

Baseline = existing envelope

Proposed = existing envelope w/ benefit of over cladding

Lighting

Baseline = Table 9.6.1 based on space classification

Proposed= Renovated lighting levels where new + non-renovated levels
where existing to remain

HVAC

Baseline = Renovated areas Table G3.1.1B + non-renovated areas existing
old HVAC design

Proposed = Renovated areas New HVAC design + non-renovated areas
existing old HVAC design

(which would also mean old boiler in both cases, new chiller[proposed]
vs prescriptive[baseline] req't)

Receptacles

Same in Both (mix of old and new levels)

 

My concern is in the lighting levels. It would seem based on the CIR
from 20090209 that if untouched HVAC gets to be modeled the same in
both, then lighting should as well but I didn't see that mentioned
anywhere. Of course if I have this completely wrong I would like to know
that as well but this is what I gathered thus far. Any help would be
appreciated.

 

Thanks

Message-ID: <141D50E6B1F9E247BD450DA0BB288FE1058C2092@l-aexc01.global.arup.com>

Hi,

I have a project were we have three buildings. (2) of which are new
buildings and (1) is an existing building. We are designing a new
central plant which will serve all three buildings. The central plant
has air-cooled chiller with ice storage. These buildings will go for (3)
separate permits for California T-24 and same is the case for LEED.

 

I am wondering how do I model this in energy pro for Title-24 as well as
for LEED.

 

As you know, LEED allows to use either T-24 or ASHRAE 90.1 as baseline.
But there is a separate document from LEED which explains how to model
systems when we have central plant serving multiple buildings (district
cooling). But these are specific to ASHRAE 90.1. Not based on T-24 as
baseline.

 

Could you please let me know how to model the central plant in energy
pro so that I can use the same model for both T-24 as well as for LEED.

 

Thanks,

Yuvaraj

What I did in Trace....

I have a mechanical room which I was going to cooled with exhaust fans
and no
mechanical cooling.  To do this, I set the infiltration equal to the
exhaust
cfm in the Airflows tab.  I then set the infiltration schedule and
exhaust
schedule to be 100% whenever the mechanical room temp was above 80
degrees.
(You will have to create a schedule.)

Modeling the exhaust cooling as infiltration worked best since the air
travels from the outside directly to the room without going through any
mechanical divice. (Coils, filters, fans....)  

I also made a coiling unit can called it "pretend" and had the set point
100
degrees.  (So it would never turn on.

..... I then made the baseline without the exhaust system, so it would
have
to mechanically cool the mechanical room to 100 degrees.

John, you army guy you...

I suggest that you embrace the art part and get good at the science. Your
model will be just as good as your input. Whats that old saw? When you point
the finger you have 3 others pointing back at you. While some modeling tools
might be close to beta and hard to use, eQUEST isn't one of them. Each new
version has bugs, but those are relatively few and are fixed quickly. You
use energy modeling to predict the energy use and energy cost of a baseline
and proposed buildings. Here in Oregon we actually do follow-up and make
sure the predicted came close to the actual. We call it model verification.
I would recommend that you spend more time learning the art, gathering the
info, creating an actual weather file if the typical one's aren't good
enough for you, and very carefully inputting the data into your modeling
tool of choice. I'd be happy to offer you peer review services if you ever
want to make sure your work is accurate.

Best,
Carol

PS I resent the heck out of LEED paperwork and am afraid they are rulemaking
creativity out of buildings. I've seen it happen over, and over, and
over.....

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Heating Energy Consumption During Summer
Message-ID: <AANLkTimGSMbvFtOQGNAbW76w60igFrugVFvd5F0LK19F@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

I have modelled a 181,000 sq.ft building in Toronto.  The building is
geothermally heated/cooled with zone heat pumps.  Fresh air is provided to
the corridors by a MUA.  Fresh air is cooled by DX coil and heated by
furnace in the MUA.  Temperature is set at 70 F.  The energy consumption
analysis shows that consumption of heating energy is same during the summer
months and the winter months for the Make up Air unit.  Can anyone suggest
any possible reason and solution to this problem?  Thanks.

Regards,
Hassan Quazi

A heating only system is permitted in the baseline ONLY if the space(s) being served are categorized as semi-heated. 90.1 defines a semi-heated space as "an enclosed space within a building that is heated by a heating system whose output capacity is greater than or equal to 3.4 Btu/h*ft2 of floor area but is not a conditioned space."



So if it's more than that then it's a conditioned space. Conditioned spaces must follow the baseline system rules of G3.1.1 and must be heated and cooled.



An unconditioned space must follow Table G3.1 #12 for modeling exhaust fans to be the same between the baseline and proposed. In the Create Rooms, Rooms tab, the room type can be set to conditioned or unconditioned.

What I did in Trace....



I have a mechanical room which I was going to cooled with exhaust fans

and no

mechanical cooling.  To do this, I set the infiltration equal to the

exhaust

cfm in the Airflows tab.  I then set the infiltration schedule and

exhaust

schedule to be 100% whenever the mechanical room temp was above 80

degrees.

(You will have to create a schedule.)



Modeling the exhaust cooling as infiltration worked best since the air

travels from the outside directly to the room without going through any

mechanical divice. (Coils, filters, fans....)



I also made a coiling unit can called it "pretend" and had the set point

100

degrees.  (So it would never turn on.



..... I then made the baseline without the exhaust system, so it would

have

to mechanically cool the mechanical room to 100 degrees.

Marty,



I usually model heating-only systems in my proposed model as PTAC

systems for

Appendix G. I use a high cooling thermostat temperature in the proposed

and

baseline models to minimize cooling energy in those spaces.

In my past experience, I had assigned those heated only spaces to VAV

systems

for the baseline model. I think that's the most appropriate way of

complying

Appendix G. And this way it went through without any comments from the

reviewer.

Hello, everyone.



I've got a question that I've never been clear on and figured I'd turn

to the

experts (you all).



In appendix G, Table G3.1.1b, it's stated that all conditioned spaces

shall

be modeled as being both heated and cooled, even if no cooling systems

exists, for both the proposed and baseline buildings.



We typically place Cabinet Unit Heaters in stairways and vestibules, and

don't worry about cooling those spaces.  So, my question is, though

TRACE has

a couple "Heating only" systems options, Appendix G says that these

cannot be

selected.  So, what is a common solution?  The other systems in the

building

are VAV, so, can those spaces just be grouped on to there?



Thanks for any advice you'd have!

Great analysis of energy modelling and the short comings of various 
simulation packages.  I especially agree with your analysis of 
equest.  I would prefer a much simpler interface with the option to 
edit the .inp file directly then run from the command line.  One can 
do this with equest but you also have to download the standalone 
version of DOE2.2 and mess around with the libraries before you can 
run an equest model from the command line.

Varkie/Chris and other Bldg-Simians:

This discussion, for better or worse (it seems unintentionally), has
found its way to both the [equest-users] and [bldg-sim] mailing lists,
and seems to be progressing as distinct conversation threads...  While
[bldg-sim]/[bldg-rate] seem to be the best fit considering the topic,
I'd encourage anyone interested in following/joining the conversation to
reply to the thread on [equest-users] as (1) it's evident the attempt by
some to cross-post is being at least partially blocked and (2) there
seems to be a larger active discussion there, so your thoughts posted
here will not be missed.

That's my third cent (the other two are already in equest-users)!

There is a story told about the philospher Socrates about how he was
lecturing to a group of students around a body of water. One of the students
posed a question to Socrates, "When, great teacher, do I know when I am
truly seeking knowledge." Without answering the student Socrates got up and
walked over to him, he then pushed the students head underwater and when the
student finally tried pushing up for air Socrates let him go. When the
student had collected his composure Socrates said to him, "when you desire
knowledge as desperatly (stet) as you were desiring air to breathe you know
you are truly seeking knowledge."

I desire air to breathe.

Just to add a couple of points to this interesting debate.

I see the problem being that, as we increasingly set more defined limits
regarding energy modelling and its role in building regulation, we are
seeing buildings that are being built and designed to purely meet
compliance.  This is in some part is useful as it brings all buildings up to
a minimum standard, the flip side of that problem is that it also means,
that to many developers this means there is no incentive to strive for
alternatives or innovative solutions.  It can also allow therefore lead to
the use of simpler tools that meet those prescribed limits, but really don't
push the boundaries of engineering design enhancement of buildings.

The correct implementation and use of energy modelling need not be a
hindrance to projects nor be seen as a necessary "extra" or evil if you
consider the design process as a whole.  If you use the tools at the concept
or schematic design phases, this can quantitatively confirm an engineer's
instinct or gained experience in way that will enable them to show
compliance later on. It will then allow the team to come to a decision on
the most energy efficient but also compliant route of design earlier on in
the design stage and should stop the repeat iteration of designs as the
building design progresses and therefore reduce design costs and with luck
increase productivity and profit accordingly.  Fanciful dream perhaps, but
it does work.

I visited an architect a while back and he said to me "Why do I need to do
modelling, I know the principles of good low energy design, I can read books
and learn more if I need to".   To which I replied, "Well every time you
send me a job to check for building regulation compliance 3 weeks before it
goes before a planning team, I normally have to tell you what you need to do
in terms of meeting compliance as your buildings are consistently failing
and you then have to rush to make those changes.  I am effectively designing
your buildings for you, so if you want to continue without using energy
modelling then please carry on, and I'll continue to design your buildings."
As you can imagine this was one of those Eureka moments for this Architect,
as I waved my red rag in front of his face.

My tuppence worth.

Paul

I do not do modeling on a daily basis so I'm not as experience as many
other here. I do agree modeling just for LEED is silly. I have seen
modeling inform designs, reduce loads, and SIZE SYSTEMS. This last part
is what most bugs me. Why do people put so much effort into models and
then not use them to size the systems? Preventing over sizing is a great
benefit of modeling. What is your experience with using models to size
systems? Why do engineers fall back on the vendor based programs and 9
out of 10 times end up over sizing systems?

Brad,

	Using energy modeling for system sizing would be a misuse of a tool.

	The energy model uses average temperatures, design uses extreme
temperatures.  
	
	Another example would be a classroom which can hold up to 40 people.
Actual use is estimated at 25 people, but owner would like to be able to have
40 people.  The model would use 25 people (actual use) but the designer would
size equipment for 40 people (worst case).

	Also, energy models get to count rejected heat from office equipment
and people.  When sizing equipment you can not count the lighting, office
equipment and people heat to assist in heating.

	There is more CYA in equipment sizing.  There is more liability.

John,

Using energy modeling programs for sizing is another topic that we'll find a
lot of people on the list disagreeing about.

Really, Trane Trace and Carrier HAP are equipment sizing programs that also
do energy modeling.

eQuest/DOE 2.2 (the program I am most familiar with) also has the option of
setting design day schedules, and will give you reports that show peak
Heating and Cooling loads.  With sound engineering judgment, a thorough
understanding of the modeling program you're using, and careful checking of
your results, I believe that you can use many hourly modeling programs to
size your equipment, or at least to provide a "second opinion" about the
results from your primary sizing program.

I have heard somewhere that the design day schedules work if, and only if,
you sit in CA. That's cause it's the good people of CA who pay for eQUEST.
Thank you CA!

So let me ask you John,

How do you find peak heating and cooling loads without using a modeling program such as HAP or Trane Trace to take into account equipment loads and solar heating loads?  Of course you can't use equipment loads to find peak heating load, but you can use them to find peak cooling loads.  Do you only size heating equipment?  And don't you realize that modeling software can be changed for different occupation conditions?  If you are using effective modeling software, there are a multitude of factors and situations that are taken into account.  Its not the software itself that is effective, it is the person who is using it intelligently ; )

Brad,

	Using energy modeling for system sizing would be a misuse of a tool.

	The energy model uses average temperatures, design uses extreme temperatures.  
	
	Another example would be a classroom which can hold up to 40 people.
Actual use is estimated at 25 people, but owner would like to be able to have 40 people.  The model would use 25 people (actual use) but the designer would size equipment for 40 people (worst case).

	Also, energy models get to count rejected heat from office equipment and people.  When sizing equipment you can not count the lighting, office equipment and people heat to assist in heating.

	There is more CYA in equipment sizing.  There is more liability.

I do not do modeling on a daily basis so I'm not as experience as many other here. I do agree modeling just for LEED is silly. I have seen modeling inform designs, reduce loads, and SIZE SYSTEMS. This last part is what most bugs me.
Why do people put so much effort into models and then not use them to size the systems? Preventing over sizing is a great benefit of modeling. What is your experience with using models to size systems? Why do engineers fall back on the vendor based programs and 9 out of 10 times end up over sizing systems?

Brad Acker, P.E.

Just to add a couple of points to this interesting debate.

I see the problem being that, as we increasingly set more defined limits regarding energy modelling and its role in building regulation, we are seeing buildings that are being built and designed to purely meet compliance.  This is in some part is useful as it brings all buildings up to a minimum standard, the flip side of that problem is that it also means, that to many developers this means there is no incentive to strive for alternatives or innovative solutions.  It can also allow therefore lead to the use of simpler tools that meet those prescribed limits, but really don't push the boundaries of engineering design enhancement of buildings.

The correct implementation and use of energy modelling need not be a hindrance to projects nor be seen as a necessary "extra" or evil if you consider the design process as a whole.  If you use the tools at the concept or schematic design phases, this can quantitatively confirm an engineer's instinct or gained experience in way that will enable them to show compliance later on. It will then allow the team to come to a decision on the most energy efficient but also compliant route of design earlier on in the design stage and should stop the repeat iteration of designs as the building design progresses and therefore reduce design costs and with luck increase productivity and profit accordingly.  Fanciful dream perhaps, but it does work.

I visited an architect a while back and he said to me "Why do I need to do modelling, I know the principles of good low energy design, I can read books
and learn more if I need to".   To which I replied, "Well every time you
send me a job to check for building regulation compliance 3 weeks before it goes before a planning team, I normally have to tell you what you need to do in terms of meeting compliance as your buildings are consistently failing and you then have to rush to make those changes.  I am effectively designing your buildings for you, so if you want to continue without using energy modelling then please carry on, and I'll continue to design your buildings."
As you can imagine this was one of those Eureka moments for this Architect, as I waved my red rag in front of his face.

My tuppence worth.

Paul

Vast subject. Kudos for condensing it whilst conveying all the necessary meaning.

We are now at a point where Energy Modellers are at the very least specialist engineers. In fact, you could say the best are indeed "wizards"!

Wow...

Two points:

1.  What Steven said; use equipment sizing software to do the energy model.
    Scheduling & weather are the only differences.

2.  Energy models will not go away, what will go away is the willingness to
    accept someone's word.  We need energy models to support design decisions
    to ourselves and others.

So let me ask you John,

How do you find peak heating and cooling loads without using a modeling program such as HAP or Trane Trace to take into account equipment loads and solar heating loads?  Of course you can't use equipment loads to find peak heating load, but you can use them to find peak cooling loads.  Do you only size heating equipment?  And don't you realize that modeling software can be changed for different occupation conditions?  If you are using effective modeling software, there are a multitude of factors and situations that are taken into account.  Its not the software itself that is effective, it is the person who is using it intelligently ; )

Brad,

	Using energy modeling for system sizing would be a misuse of a tool.

	The energy model uses average temperatures, design uses extreme temperatures.  
	
	Another example would be a classroom which can hold up to 40 people.
Actual use is estimated at 25 people, but owner would like to be able to have 40 people.  The model would use 25 people (actual use) but the designer would size equipment for 40 people (worst case).

	Also, energy models get to count rejected heat from office equipment and people.  When sizing equipment you can not count the lighting, office equipment and people heat to assist in heating.

	There is more CYA in equipment sizing.  There is more liability.

I do not do modeling on a daily basis so I'm not as experience as many other here. I do agree modeling just for LEED is silly. I have seen modeling inform designs, reduce loads, and SIZE SYSTEMS. This last part is what most bugs me.
Why do people put so much effort into models and then not use them to size the systems? Preventing over sizing is a great benefit of modeling. What is your experience with using models to size systems? Why do engineers fall back on the vendor based programs and 9 out of 10 times end up over sizing systems?

Just to add a couple of points to this interesting debate.

I see the problem being that, as we increasingly set more defined limits regarding energy modelling and its role in building regulation, we are seeing buildings that are being built and designed to purely meet compliance.  This is in some part is useful as it brings all buildings up to a minimum standard, the flip side of that problem is that it also means, that to many developers this means there is no incentive to strive for alternatives or innovative solutions.  It can also allow therefore lead to the use of simpler tools that meet those prescribed limits, but really don't push the boundaries of engineering design enhancement of buildings.

The correct implementation and use of energy modelling need not be a hindrance to projects nor be seen as a necessary "extra" or evil if you consider the design process as a whole.  If you use the tools at the concept or schematic design phases, this can quantitatively confirm an engineer's instinct or gained experience in way that will enable them to show compliance later on. It will then allow the team to come to a decision on the most energy efficient but also compliant route of design earlier on in the design stage and should stop the repeat iteration of designs as the building design progresses and therefore reduce design costs and with luck increase productivity and profit accordingly.  Fanciful dream perhaps, but it does work.

I visited an architect a while back and he said to me "Why do I need to do modelling, I know the principles of good low energy design, I can read books
and learn more if I need to".   To which I replied, "Well every time you
send me a job to check for building regulation compliance 3 weeks before it goes before a planning team, I normally have to tell you what you need to do in terms of meeting compliance as your buildings are consistently failing and you then have to rush to make those changes.  I am effectively designing your buildings for you, so if you want to continue without using energy modelling then please carry on, and I'll continue to design your buildings."
As you can imagine this was one of those Eureka moments for this Architect, as I waved my red rag in front of his face.

My tuppence worth.

Paul

Matt,

I use trace for Sizing and energy modeling.  But I have 3 different files.

1.  Equipment sizing - This has the max number of people ever expected in the
building. So if it was a school I don't count a child in the classroom and
the lunch room (he is either in one place or the other).  I set the lights
and people to be cooling only.  This is used to size chillers, boilers, the
other plants.

2.  System sizing -  I call this a butt in every seat. This has the max
number of people in each zone. I use this to size VAV boxes and other zone
equipment.  The number of people is larger than reality.

3.  Energy Model - This has schedule, the office equipment schedules (heat
rejection counts), I input data about equipment performance, drift points....
Well you know about energy modeling.  


What you can't do is print out your enegy model and try to use the results to
size equipment. (from what I understand)

I use the same program, same construction, same temperature setting but each
file has a different intent.  I change the weather from 99.5% to the 8760, I
change the number of people from worst case, to actual.

There many be other methods, but this is how I do it.

Brad,

I did HVAC design consulting for 14 years, and I used to oversize
systems just like everyone else.  Now I am an energy conservation
programs evaluator, and have discovered the extent and negative impacts
of over sizing.  Not speaking for all designers who oversize, I did it
mainly out of willful ignorance.  It was easier for me to loosely
calculate the peak loads and then beef those estimates up enough to
safely cover and mistakes or false assumptions than it was to calculate
the loads with enough confidence to properly size the systems.  I
believed in the old adage that too much is just right from my
perspective, because it minimized risk.

But now I have to measure the effects of excessive over sizing and see
the results, some of which are poor humidity control, short cycling,
reduced system operating efficiency and higher first cost to the owner.
My DOE2 models usually indicate peak (I mean absolute hourly peak loads)
at about 20% less than Manual J loads, on average, for residential
applications.  But even Manual J allows up to 20% above their calculated
loads, which have already been calculated using conservative estimates
for most inputs that are not explicitly defined.  The observed
(measured) field results have proven the average residential AC system
to be about 70% to 75% oversized, with some as high as 200% (that's 3
times the peak load).  20% to 25% over ASHRAE's 2.5% design standard is
acceptable to me now, but anything above 25% without some overriding
owner requirement (plans to add on to the current building, etc.) begins
to waste the owner's resources (from first cost to energy and
maintenance costs) and reduce the lifetime of the equipment while at the
same time decreasing his overall level of comfort through limited latent
performance.

There!  You obviously rubbed a sore spot in my emotional make-up, but I
appreciate the opportunity to make a point.  And the point is this: no
matter how good your modeling software is, the outcome is still in the
hands of the user.

Glenn

I do not do modeling on a daily basis so I'm not as experience as many
other here. I do agree modeling just for LEED is silly. I have seen
modeling inform designs, reduce loads, and SIZE SYSTEMS. This last part
is what most bugs me. Why do people put so much effort into models and
then not use them to size the systems? Preventing over sizing is a great
benefit of modeling. What is your experience with using models to size
systems? Why do engineers fall back on the vendor based programs and 9
out of 10 times end up over sizing systems?

Just to add a couple of points to this interesting debate.

I see the problem being that, as we increasingly set more defined limits
regarding energy modelling and its role in building regulation, we are
seeing buildings that are being built and designed to purely meet
compliance.  This is in some part is useful as it brings all buildings
up to a minimum standard, the flip side of that problem is that it also
means, that to many developers this means there is no incentive to
strive for alternatives or innovative solutions.  It can also allow
therefore lead to the use of simpler tools that meet those prescribed
limits, but really don't push the boundaries of engineering design
enhancement of buildings.

The correct implementation and use of energy modelling need not be a
hindrance to projects nor be seen as a necessary "extra" or evil if you
consider the design process as a whole.  If you use the tools at the
concept or schematic design phases, this can quantitatively confirm an
engineer's instinct or gained experience in way that will enable them to
show compliance later on. It will then allow the team to come to a
decision on the most energy efficient but also compliant route of design
earlier on in the design stage and should stop the repeat iteration of
designs as the building design progresses and therefore reduce design
costs and with luck increase productivity and profit accordingly.
Fanciful dream perhaps, but it does work.

I visited an architect a while back and he said to me "Why do I need to
do modelling, I know the principles of good low energy design, I can
read books
and learn more if I need to".   To which I replied, "Well every time you
send me a job to check for building regulation compliance 3 weeks before
it goes before a planning team, I normally have to tell you what you
need to do in terms of meeting compliance as your buildings are
consistently failing and you then have to rush to make those changes.  I
am effectively designing your buildings for you, so if you want to
continue without using energy modelling then please carry on, and I'll
continue to design your buildings."
As you can imagine this was one of those Eureka moments for this
Architect, as I waved my red rag in front of his face.

My tuppence worth.

Paul

That is a good point. It is almost impossible to not oversize the HVAC system from the prospective of designing heating and cooling equiplment.  No one can really know what will really happen after the building is built.  Actual use in buildings are alwasy different from the design intent as there are big uncertainties for real buildings. Of course it is very important to try to get accurate information during the design phase. But we may more focus on three things,
1: Continue to monior the actual building energy use and equipment efficiency in buildings.  These measurements should be very helpful to find some ways to save energy for the newly finished buildings.  
2: Improving part load performance in HVAC equipment may be more important than not oversizing HVAC equipment.  It seems there is no way to design the very appropriate systems to suit the actual use in buildings.  For example, the building loads may be changed a lot from year to year, day to day, hour to hour.  
3: For HVAC designer,  maybe it is necessary to understand which factors are key variables to size the HVAC system. Maybe for some buildings, the weather conditions (99% or 99.5%) will make big differences in sizing HVAC equipment. But for other buildings, the building use, like internal heat gains, is more important. This can help us which factors we should focus on.

The difference between using equipment sizing software and hourly
building energy simulation software is interpretation of the peak loads.
The equipment sizing software utilizes a worst case scenario of load
contributing conditions to size the equipment and yields an appropriate
peak system load up front - no need to beef it up except to cover errors
or extenuating circumstances.

A building energy simulation code yields the peak loads under the most
probable conjunction of extreme conditions, so you should beef those up
by some reasonable factor if you need to guarantee enough capacity under
the most extreme combination of factors.

Either way, you should end up with approximately the same system size
without unnecessary over sizing.  But if you beef up the equipment
sizing software results without proper justification, and then select
the next higher modular equipment size, you will probably end up with an
unnecessarily oversized system; a low personal risk approach, but not
the best design choice for the client who has to pay for it and live
with it.

John,

Using energy modeling programs for sizing is another topic that we'll
find a lot of people on the list disagreeing about.

Really, Trane Trace and Carrier HAP are equipment sizing programs that
also do energy modeling.

eQuest/DOE 2.2 (the program I am most familiar with) also has the option
of setting design day schedules, and will give you reports that show
peak Heating and Cooling loads.  With sound engineering judgment, a
thorough understanding of the modeling program you're using, and careful
checking of your results, I believe that you can use many hourly
modeling programs to size your equipment, or at least to provide a
"second opinion" about the results from your primary sizing program.

Brad,

	Using energy modeling for system sizing would be a misuse of a
tool.

	The energy model uses average temperatures, design uses extreme
temperatures.  
	
	Another example would be a classroom which can hold up to 40
people.
Actual use is estimated at 25 people, but owner would like to be able to
have 40 people.  The model would use 25 people (actual use) but the
designer would size equipment for 40 people (worst case).

	Also, energy models get to count rejected heat from office
equipment and people.  When sizing equipment you can not count the
lighting, office equipment and people heat to assist in heating.

	There is more CYA in equipment sizing.  There is more liability.

I do not do modeling on a daily basis so I'm not as experience as many
other here. I do agree modeling just for LEED is silly. I have seen
modeling inform designs, reduce loads, and SIZE SYSTEMS. This last part
is what most bugs me.
Why do people put so much effort into models and then not use them to
size the systems? Preventing over sizing is a great benefit of modeling.
What is your experience with using models to size systems? Why do
engineers fall back on the vendor based programs and 9 out of 10 times
end up over sizing systems?

Brad Acker, P.E.

Just to add a couple of points to this interesting debate.

I see the problem being that, as we increasingly set more defined limits
regarding energy modelling and its role in building regulation, we are
seeing buildings that are being built and designed to purely meet
compliance.  This is in some part is useful as it brings all buildings
up to a minimum standard, the flip side of that problem is that it also
means, that to many developers this means there is no incentive to
strive for alternatives or innovative solutions.  It can also allow
therefore lead to the use of simpler tools that meet those prescribed
limits, but really don't push the boundaries of engineering design
enhancement of buildings.

The correct implementation and use of energy modelling need not be a
hindrance to projects nor be seen as a necessary "extra" or evil if you
consider the design process as a whole.  If you use the tools at the
concept or schematic design phases, this can quantitatively confirm an
engineer's instinct or gained experience in way that will enable them to
show compliance later on. It will then allow the team to come to a
decision on the most energy efficient but also compliant route of design
earlier on in the design stage and should stop the repeat iteration of
designs as the building design progresses and therefore reduce design
costs and with luck increase productivity and profit accordingly.
Fanciful dream perhaps, but it does work.

I visited an architect a while back and he said to me "Why do I need to
do modelling, I know the principles of good low energy design, I can
read books
and learn more if I need to".   To which I replied, "Well every time you
send me a job to check for building regulation compliance 3 weeks before
it goes before a planning team, I normally have to tell you what you
need to do in terms of meeting compliance as your buildings are
consistently failing and you then have to rush to make those changes.  I
am effectively designing your buildings for you, so if you want to
continue without using energy modelling then please carry on, and I'll
continue to design your buildings."
As you can imagine this was one of those Eureka moments for this
Architect, as I waved my red rag in front of his face.

My tuppence worth.

Paul

Vast subject. Kudos for condensing it whilst conveying all the necessary
meaning.

We are now at a point where Energy Modellers are at the very least
specialist engineers. In fact, you could say the best are indeed

John,

I would call the files 1 & 2  Coincidental and Non-coincidental loads -
Coincidental for primary plant and non-coincidental for zone equipment. As
well as your "file 3" energy modeling we use (in the UK) a frequency
analysis based on an extreme summer year (Design Summer Year). Most of the
time it is used for informing natural ventilation design but it can equally
be used where plant is undersized or the room system is restricted (e.g.
chilled ceilings delivering say 75w/m2 @ 25degC Room Air temp). It works
well for our temperate climate and goes along the lines of an "allowance" of
occupied hours when temperatures can be above certain limits.

Virtually all simulation engines can have their weather files "frigged" to
represent steady state winter conditions or a summer design day. The only
issue - as far as CIBSE is concerned - is that it can be tricky to implement
the strictest form of steady state heat loss where coincidental fabric gains
from adjacent spaces are ignored (synonymous with your file 2).

The other nice thing about simulation is capability to undertake "what if"
scenarios. For example, my heating has been on low during a holiday, how
long will it take to heat it back up with 20% plant oversize?

Glenn,

Oversize isn't always bad! A condensing boiler is generally at its most
efficient at < 20% of its capacity.

All the same, the mid-season is largely ignored when it comes to sizing.
Ridiculous really, when you think this is where the plant will be 90% of the
time.

Perhaps this is more of an issue when you are shifting large amounts of
chilled water to various pieces of zone equipment but has anybody considered
Valve Authority? Unfortunately my experience is limited when it comes to the
nitty gritty of piping networks. But, I do know one thing: valve response is
not linear, especially if there is a substantial head in the system. My
hunch is mid season control could get really messed up if plant has spare
capacity but designers haven't been quite as generous with pipe sizes.

Such questions should be in the domain of simulation in the next few years.

As a designer of geothermal hvac systems I found this very relevant.  For vertical closed loop systems you buy by the foot.  Over design of 5 or 10 percent adds that much cost and effects the return on investment for the client.  The ground loop is sized based on monthy peak and total loads.

The difference between using equipment sizing software and hourly
building energy simulation software is interpretation of the peak loads.
The equipment sizing software utilizes a worst case scenario of load
contributing conditions to size the equipment and yields an appropriate
peak system load up front - no need to beef it up except to cover errors
or extenuating circumstances.

A building energy simulation code yields the peak loads under the most
probable conjunction of extreme conditions, so you should beef those up
by some reasonable factor if you need to guarantee enough capacity under
the most extreme combination of factors.

Either way, you should end up with approximately the same system size
without unnecessary over sizing.  But if you beef up the equipment
sizing software results without proper justification, and then select
the next higher modular equipment size, you will probably end up with an
unnecessarily oversized system; a low personal risk approach, but not
the best design choice for the client who has to pay for it and live
with it.

John,

Using energy modeling programs for sizing is another topic that we'll
find a lot of people on the list disagreeing about.

Really, Trane Trace and Carrier HAP are equipment sizing programs that
also do energy modeling.

eQuest/DOE 2.2 (the program I am most familiar with) also has the option
of setting design day schedules, and will give you reports that show
peak Heating and Cooling loads.  With sound engineering judgment, a
thorough understanding of the modeling program you're using, and careful
checking of your results, I believe that you can use many hourly
modeling programs to size your equipment, or at least to provide a
"second opinion" about the results from your primary sizing program.

Brad,

	Using energy modeling for system sizing would be a misuse of a
tool.

	The energy model uses average temperatures, design uses extreme
temperatures.  
	
	Another example would be a classroom which can hold up to 40
people.
Actual use is estimated at 25 people, but owner would like to be able to
have 40 people.  The model would use 25 people (actual use) but the
designer would size equipment for 40 people (worst case).

	Also, energy models get to count rejected heat from office
equipment and people.  When sizing equipment you can not count the
lighting, office equipment and people heat to assist in heating.

	There is more CYA in equipment sizing.  There is more liability.

Why do people put so much effort into models and then not use them to

Just to add a couple of points to this interesting debate.

I see the problem being that, as we increasingly set more defined limits
regarding energy modelling and its role in building regulation, we are
seeing buildings that are being built and designed to purely meet
compliance.  This is in some part is useful as it brings all buildings
up to a minimum standard, the flip side of that problem is that it also
means, that to many developers this means there is no incentive to
strive for alternatives or innovative solutions.  It can also allow
therefore lead to the use of simpler tools that meet those prescribed
limits, but really don't push the boundaries of engineering design
enhancement of buildings.

The correct implementation and use of energy modelling need not be a
hindrance to projects nor be seen as a necessary "extra" or evil if you
consider the design process as a whole.  If you use the tools at the
concept or schematic design phases, this can quantitatively confirm an
engineer's instinct or gained experience in way that will enable them to
show compliance later on. It will then allow the team to come to a
decision on the most energy efficient but also compliant route of design
earlier on in the design stage and should stop the repeat iteration of
designs as the building design progresses and therefore reduce design
costs and with luck increase productivity and profit accordingly.
Fanciful dream perhaps, but it does work.

I visited an architect a while back and he said to me "Why do I need to
do modelling, I know the principles of good low energy design, I can
read books
and learn more if I need to".   To which I replied, "Well every time you
send me a job to check for building regulation compliance 3 weeks before
it goes before a planning team, I normally have to tell you what you
need to do in terms of meeting compliance as your buildings are
consistently failing and you then have to rush to make those changes.  I
am effectively designing your buildings for you, so if you want to
continue without using energy modelling then please carry on, and I'll
continue to design your buildings."
As you can imagine this was one of those Eureka moments for this
Architect, as I waved my red rag in front of his face.

My tuppence worth.

Glenn, I couldn't agree more.

 

I think the advantage of energy modelling as opposed to just pure sizing is
that you can look at the normal operational loads against the peak sizing
loads.  This can then allow you to look at modularisation of your plant so
that you only operate as much plant as you need and you run that plant at
optimal efficiency more of the time rather than say running a single boiler
at low part load efficiency.  Thus you are not only carrying out your
sizing, but then you are checking whether it will work in practice and
ensure that your design is efficient. 

 

It is important to remember, that a sizing tool which is essentially a
steady state calculation tool will not take the thermal inertia of the
building into account, therefore your building could actually be
hotter/cooler than your cooling sizing calculation suggests it is and this
would obviously effect the sizing of the system.  Cooling is clearly very
expensive in terms of capital expenditure, but also lifecycle running and
maintenance costs therefore should be minimised as much as possible.

 

Paul

The difference between using equipment sizing software and hourly
building energy simulation software is interpretation of the peak loads.
The equipment sizing software utilizes a worst case scenario of load
contributing conditions to size the equipment and yields an appropriate
peak system load up front - no need to beef it up except to cover errors
or extenuating circumstances.

A building energy simulation code yields the peak loads under the most
probable conjunction of extreme conditions, so you should beef those up
by some reasonable factor if you need to guarantee enough capacity under
the most extreme combination of factors.

Either way, you should end up with approximately the same system size
without unnecessary over sizing.  But if you beef up the equipment
sizing software results without proper justification, and then select
the next higher modular equipment size, you will probably end up with an
unnecessarily oversized system; a low personal risk approach, but not
the best design choice for the client who has to pay for it and live
with it.

John,

Using energy modeling programs for sizing is another topic that we'll
find a lot of people on the list disagreeing about.

Really, Trane Trace and Carrier HAP are equipment sizing programs that
also do energy modeling.

eQuest/DOE 2.2 (the program I am most familiar with) also has the option
of setting design day schedules, and will give you reports that show
peak Heating and Cooling loads.  With sound engineering judgment, a
thorough understanding of the modeling program you're using, and careful
checking of your results, I believe that you can use many hourly
modeling programs to size your equipment, or at least to provide a
"second opinion" about the results from your primary sizing program.

Brad,

        Using energy modeling for system sizing would be a misuse of a
tool.

        The energy model uses average temperatures, design uses extreme
temperatures. 
       
        Another example would be a classroom which can hold up to 40
people.
Actual use is estimated at 25 people, but owner would like to be able to
have 40 people.  The model would use 25 people (actual use) but the
designer would size equipment for 40 people (worst case).

        Also, energy models get to count rejected heat from office
equipment and people.  When sizing equipment you can not count the
lighting, office equipment and people heat to assist in heating.

        There is more CYA in equipment sizing.  There is more liability.

I do not do modeling on a daily basis so I'm not as experience as many
other here. I do agree modeling just for LEED is silly. I have seen
modeling inform designs, reduce loads, and SIZE SYSTEMS. This last part
is what most bugs me.
Why do people put so much effort into models and then not use them to
size the systems? Preventing over sizing is a great benefit of modeling.
What is your experience with using models to size systems? Why do
engineers fall back on the vendor based programs and 9 out of 10 times
end up over sizing systems?

Just to add a couple of points to this interesting debate.

I see the problem being that, as we increasingly set more defined limits
regarding energy modelling and its role in building regulation, we are
seeing buildings that are being built and designed to purely meet
compliance.  This is in some part is useful as it brings all buildings
up to a minimum standard, the flip side of that problem is that it also
means, that to many developers this means there is no incentive to
strive for alternatives or innovative solutions.  It can also allow
therefore lead to the use of simpler tools that meet those prescribed
limits, but really don't push the boundaries of engineering design
enhancement of buildings.

The correct implementation and use of energy modelling need not be a
hindrance to projects nor be seen as a necessary "extra" or evil if you
consider the design process as a whole.  If you use the tools at the
concept or schematic design phases, this can quantitatively confirm an
engineer's instinct or gained experience in way that will enable them to
show compliance later on. It will then allow the team to come to a
decision on the most energy efficient but also compliant route of design
earlier on in the design stage and should stop the repeat iteration of
designs as the building design progresses and therefore reduce design
costs and with luck increase productivity and profit accordingly.
Fanciful dream perhaps, but it does work.

I visited an architect a while back and he said to me "Why do I need to
do modelling, I know the principles of good low energy design, I can
read books
and learn more if I need to".   To which I replied, "Well every time you
send me a job to check for building regulation compliance 3 weeks before
it goes before a planning team, I normally have to tell you what you
need to do in terms of meeting compliance as your buildings are
consistently failing and you then have to rush to make those changes.  I
am effectively designing your buildings for you, so if you want to
continue without using energy modelling then please carry on, and I'll
continue to design your buildings."
As you can imagine this was one of those Eureka moments for this
Architect, as I waved my red rag in front of his face.

My tuppence worth.

Paul

Vast subject. Kudos for condensing it whilst conveying all the necessary

We are now at a point where Energy Modellers are at the very least

Chris,

You make a good point, and it also can apply to centrifugal chillers,
which are sometimes most efficient at 60-80% loaded.  But you still have
to remember that the client has to pay for the larger equipment, which
costs more, plus larger system components (which cost more) and more
space (which costs more).

You also maake a good point about the system loads 90% of the time,
which raises an interesting question regarding sizing for optimum
operating efficiency.  What if we sized certain types of equipment to
meet the most predominant loads within their most efficient capacity
ranges?  That is not difficult when using hourly simulation software.
Of course, you have to keep an eye on peak loads and capacities.  I
haven't thought this through yet, but I'll bet someone else has.

Thanks,
Glenn

Glenn,

Oversize isn't always bad! A condensing boiler is generally at its most
efficient at < 20% of its capacity.

All the same, the mid-season is largely ignored when it comes to sizing.
Ridiculous really, when you think this is where the plant will be 90% of
the time.

Perhaps this is more of an issue when you are shifting large amounts of
chilled water to various pieces of zone equipment but has anybody
considered Valve Authority? Unfortunately my experience is limited when
it comes to the nitty gritty of piping networks. But, I do know one
thing: valve response is not linear, especially if there is a
substantial head in the system. My hunch is mid season control could get
really messed up if plant has spare capacity but designers haven't been
quite as generous with pipe sizes.

Such questions should be in the domain of simulation in the next few
years.

operating efficiency.? What if we sized certain types of equipment to
meet the most predominant loads within their most efficient capacity
ranges?? That is not difficult when using hourly simulation software.
Of course, you have to keep an eye on peak loads and capacities.? I
haven't thought this through yet, but I'll bet someone else has.

Thanks,
Glenn

Glenn,

Oversize isn't always bad! A condensing boiler is generally at its most
efficient at < 20% of its capacity.

All the same, the mid-season is largely ignored when it comes to sizing.
Ridiculous really, when you think this is where the plant will be 90% of
the time.

Perhaps this is more of an issue when you are shifting large amounts of
chilled water to various pieces of zone equipment but has anybody
considered Valve Authority? Unfortunately my experience is limited when
it comes to the nitty gritty of piping networks. But, I do know one
thing: valve response is not linear, especially if there is a
substantial head in the system. My hunch is mid season control could get
really messed up if plant has spare capacity but designers haven't been
quite as generous with pipe sizes.

Such questions should be in the domain of simulation in the next few
years.

Chris,

You make a good point, and it also can apply to centrifugal chillers,
which are sometimes most efficient at 60-80% loaded.  But you still have
to remember that the client has to pay for the larger equipment, which
costs more, plus larger system components (which cost more) and more
space (which costs more).

You also maake a good point about the system loads 90% of the time,
which raises an interesting question regarding sizing for optimum
operating efficiency.  What if we sized certain types of equipment to
meet the most predominant loads within their most efficient capacity
ranges?  That is not difficult when using hourly simulation software.
Of course, you have to keep an eye on peak loads and capacities.  I
haven't thought this through yet, but I'll bet someone else has.

Thanks,
Glenn

John,

If this is the procedure you're following for modeling in TRACE, I can see why you view modeling as a pain in the arse. With proper use of schedules, day types, and diversity, what you've described below is easily accomplished in one alternative in one file. I highly suggest attending one of several of our training sessions held throughout the year.

Matt,

I use trace for Sizing and energy modeling.  But I have 3 different files.

1.  Equipment sizing - This has the max number of people ever expected in the
building. So if it was a school I don't count a child in the classroom and
the lunch room (he is either in one place or the other).  I set the lights
and people to be cooling only.  This is used to size chillers, boilers, the
other plants.

2.  System sizing -  I call this a butt in every seat. This has the max
number of people in each zone. I use this to size VAV boxes and other zone
equipment.  The number of people is larger than reality.

3.  Energy Model - This has schedule, the office equipment schedules (heat
rejection counts), I input data about equipment performance, drift points....
Well you know about energy modeling.


What you can't do is print out your enegy model and try to use the results to
size equipment. (from what I understand)

I use the same program, same construction, same temperature setting but each
file has a different intent.  I change the weather from 99.5% to the 8760, I
change the number of people from worst case, to actual.

There many be other methods, but this is how I do it.

So let me ask you John,

How do you find peak heating and cooling loads without using a modeling
program such as HAP or Trane Trace to take into account equipment loads and
solar heating loads?  Of course you can't use equipment loads to find peak
heating load, but you can use them to find peak cooling loads.  Do you only
size heating equipment?  And don't you realize that modeling software can be
changed for different occupation conditions?  If you are using effective
modeling software, there are a multitude of factors and situations that are
taken into account.  Its not the software itself that is effective, it is the
person who is using it intelligently ; )

Brad,

        Using energy modeling for system sizing would be a misuse of a tool.

        The energy model uses average temperatures, design uses extreme
temperatures.

        Another example would be a classroom which can hold up to 40 people.
Actual use is estimated at 25 people, but owner would like to be able to have
40 people.  The model would use 25 people (actual use) but the designer would
size equipment for 40 people (worst case).

        Also, energy models get to count rejected heat from office equipment
and people.  When sizing equipment you can not count the lighting, office
equipment and people heat to assist in heating.

        There is more CYA in equipment sizing.  There is more liability.

I do not do modeling on a daily basis so I'm not as experience as many other
here. I do agree modeling just for LEED is silly. I have seen modeling inform
designs, reduce loads, and SIZE SYSTEMS. This last part is what most bugs me.
Why do people put so much effort into models and then not use them to size
the systems? Preventing over sizing is a great benefit of modeling. What is
your experience with using models to size systems? Why do engineers fall back
on the vendor based programs and 9 out of 10 times end up over sizing
systems?

Just to add a couple of points to this interesting debate.

I see the problem being that, as we increasingly set more defined limits
regarding energy modelling and its role in building regulation, we are seeing
buildings that are being built and designed to purely meet compliance.  This
is in some part is useful as it brings all buildings up to a minimum
standard, the flip side of that problem is that it also means, that to many
developers this means there is no incentive to strive for alternatives or
innovative solutions.  It can also allow therefore lead to the use of simpler
tools that meet those prescribed limits, but really don't push the boundaries
of engineering design enhancement of buildings.

The correct implementation and use of energy modelling need not be a
hindrance to projects nor be seen as a necessary "extra" or evil if you
consider the design process as a whole.  If you use the tools at the concept
or schematic design phases, this can quantitatively confirm an engineer's
instinct or gained experience in way that will enable them to show compliance
later on. It will then allow the team to come to a decision on the most
energy efficient but also compliant route of design earlier on in the design
stage and should stop the repeat iteration of designs as the building design
progresses and therefore reduce design costs and with luck increase
productivity and profit accordingly.  Fanciful dream perhaps, but it does
work.

I visited an architect a while back and he said to me "Why do I need to do
modelling, I know the principles of good low energy design, I can read books
and learn more if I need to".   To which I replied, "Well every time you
send me a job to check for building regulation compliance 3 weeks before it
goes before a planning team, I normally have to tell you what you need to do
in terms of meeting compliance as your buildings are consistently failing and
you then have to rush to make those changes.  I am effectively designing your
buildings for you, so if you want to continue without using energy modelling
then please carry on, and I'll continue to design your buildings."
As you can imagine this was one of those Eureka moments for this Architect,
as I waved my red rag in front of his face.

My tuppence worth.

Paul

Jason,
 
Thanks for your insightful response.  To a large degree I concur.  You
encounter various situations out there as a design consultant, and you
need to understand the plans and needs of your client.  But surely you
recognize that there are some cases where over sizing is not required,
and the client may actually prefer to pay less up front and get a better
operating system than always be able to maintain set point under the
most extreme combination of conditions.  When maintaining perfect
environmental control is critical, then you must oversize accordingly,
but when it isn't, you may assign more priority to proper sizing, or, in
rare cases, under sizing.
 
I personally would prefer a slightly undersized AC system in my home to
an oversized one if I had to choose between the two.  I understand the
advantages, and prefer to risk having to tolerate a little discomfort
for a few hours a year than to pay for and operate an excessively
oversized system for the next 15 to 20 years.
 
But to offer this to a client may be risky business unless you get him
to sign a waiver, and then it is still risky.  On the other hand, if you
can determine the maximum probable system load and add a reasonable
10-25% to that, you will have satisfied the client's needs with a
reasonable margin of safety.  The only angry clients I have ever
encountered were angry because their system was failing to deliver a
significant amount of the time when circumstances were only normal, in
which cases the engineer had made a serious error and specified a system
that was grossly undersized.  I don't recommend over sizing to make
certain this doesn't happen.  Instead I recommend checking and double
checking your sizing calculations so you don't make such a mistake.
 
This is a hot issue because nearly every HVAC engineer is going to
sooner or later make that proverbial mistake, lose self-confidence, and
from then on join those that oversize their systems more than necessary
just to cover potential mistakes.  Most clients are none the wiser
anyhow, and, after it has all been paid for, some actually enjoy the
feeling of knowing they have a "honker of an air conditioner" that is
capable of cooling the place down in 60 seconds or less.  So what do we
have to lose?  I think it might be some of our own professional and
personal integrity!  Not much else comes to mind.
 
Now I have said too much, so I will bow out of this, knowing that last
paragraph may ruffle some feathers.
 
Glenn

Glenn,
 
For load sizing, over sizing equipment can be bad with them short
cycling and energy hogs.  But on the other hand under sizing a system
can be just as bad.  When you size equipment you normally can't select
equipment that will meet your building load exact so most engineers
normally go to the next size up in equipment. Very rare do I see or hear
any one pick the size down in equipment.  Its the nature of the beast.
Everyone has the fear of being sued from an owner it is easier to
oversize the equipment that way you have the extra capacity if you need
it, than having to deal with an angry owner.  
 
My view on energy simulation is like trying to kill a fly with a bullet.
Everyone is trying to predict exactly what a building will do and how it
will perform, and you just can't.  There are so may variables in an
energy simulation, some variables you can predict and even control and
other variables you just can't predict or possibly even know.  That is
why I believe it is important to relay the bases of your energy
simulation to whomever you are presenting it to.  That the simulation is
based on these parameters and based on these parameters this is how the
building should perform.  And then when the building is build and its
performance is better or worse than what you predicted then you can
compare the variables and see which ones are off and how bad.  And the
most common variables that is normally off is infiltration and weather.
But no one goes back to a building after it has been build to adjust
there model to see what was off.  And that is also the nature of the
beast as well.

Chris,

You make a good point, and it also can apply to centrifugal chillers,
which are sometimes most efficient at 60-80% loaded.  But you still have
to remember that the client has to pay for the larger equipment, which
costs more, plus larger system components (which cost more) and more
space (which costs more).

You also maake a good point about the system loads 90% of the time,
which raises an interesting question regarding sizing for optimum
operating efficiency.  What if we sized certain types of equipment to
meet the most predominant loads within their most efficient capacity
ranges?  That is not difficult when using hourly simulation software.
Of course, you have to keep an eye on peak loads and capacities.  I
haven't thought this through yet, but I'll bet someone else has.

Thanks,
Glenn

Glenn,

Oversize isn't always bad! A condensing boiler is generally at its most
efficient at < 20% of its capacity.

All the same, the mid-season is largely ignored when it comes to sizing.
Ridiculous really, when you think this is where the plant will be 90% of
the time.

Perhaps this is more of an issue when you are shifting large amounts of
chilled water to various pieces of zone equipment but has anybody
considered Valve Authority? Unfortunately my experience is limited when
it comes to the nitty gritty of piping networks. But, I do know one
thing: valve response is not linear, especially if there is a
substantial head in the system. My hunch is mid season control could get
really messed up if plant has spare capacity but designers haven't been
quite as generous with pipe sizes.

Such questions should be in the domain of simulation in the next few
years.

I changed the topic name to ?Equipment Sizing?.  I thought I would add my 2 cents worth also.  So now Bldg-Sim has 8 cents worth.
 
The first building project that I was associated was at the tail end of the M-E design at JB&B of the Federal Reserve Bank Building in Minneapolis.
http://www.lera.com/projects/ofc/federalreservemn.htm
The building opened in January (I think) in the early 70s.  ASHRAE winter design at 1% is -16 F.  When the building opened it was about -30 F (it can go down to -40 F there) with strong winds.  Occupants in the US are not dressed (with full arm and leg heavy woolen underwear) to tolerate low indoor temps even for one day.  
 
Summer design in Minneapolis at 1% is 92 DB 75 WB but the DB can exceed 100 F.  Occupants can tolerate a little discomfort on the few days that extreme summer conditions occur.  It?s still better than no AC.  Few, if any, buildings were air-conditioned, even in the US, before 1940.  The moral of this story is design for extreme winter conditions in very cold climates.  Judgment, experience, and common sense have to be applied.  It depends on the location.  In a place like Singapore the temp varies from a low of 75 F to 95 F all day and all year.  There are no extremes.  All buildings in tropical countries do not need heating systems.
 
Inefficient energy use occurs when there is only one unit of the equipment and it is oversized.  When there are two or more units, one unit starts until it reaches maximum, then second unit comes on and the two shares load.  The units are rarely operated at minimum load.  This is the default in DOE2 but LOAD-MANAGEMENT allows you to sequence the use of primary equipment in any way you want that is appropriate for the project.
 
The lighting and equipment design criteria was 5 watts /sf and 3 watts /sf for buildings designed before the energy crises in 1974.  No one cared about energy before then.  Actual lighting density was nowhere close, and there was very little equipment in offices.  This means for a million sqft building you end up with three chillers.  One is standby which comes into operation when a chiller fails or one chiller has to be shut down for maintenance.  Specifying standby primary equipment affects first costs and does not affect equipment efficiency.
 
Energy programs are for comparing alternative energy conservation measures.  There is no need to size equipment for occasional extreme weather conditions.  But I think auto-sizing is based on weather data (not design data or median weather data) so equipment is sized for the worst condition of that year.  This means at every other hour of the year the equipment is operating inefficiently at part load conditions.  Equipment sizes estimated by energy programs are used in the design process.
 
Equipment schedules in design documents are based on actual equipment selected from manufacturers catalogs.  The name of the manufacturer and the model number are specified and then ?or equal? added.  Equipment schedules are not based on design calculations or generic data because it is possible that real equipment cannot meet the performance data.  You need the dimensions of the equipment (with clearances for maintenance) to design them into the space.  TRACE energy program is based on actual real equipment performance data specified my model numbers.  HAP is based on real equipment, but they don?t mention model numbers.
 
I think the Code of Federal Regulations 10CFR434 (ENERGY CODE FOR NEW FEDERAL COMMERCIAL AND MULTI-FAMILY HIGH RISE RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS) used to allow you to size two identical units of primary equipment each at 66% of the maximum design.  This would be commercial buildings with large heating and cooling loads where you would have two units.  Perhaps it was a special case where failure to perform at all times was not an option.  I couldn?t find it the latest register.
http://www.wbdg.org/pdfs/10cfr434.pdf
 
10CFR434 - 403.2.2 Equipment and System Sizing.
Heating and cooling equipment and systems shall be sized to provide no more than the loads calculated in accordance with subsection 403.2.1. A single piece of equipment providing both heating and cooling must satisfy this provision for one function with the other function sized as small as possible to meet the load, within available equipment options. Exceptions are as follows:
(a) When the equipment selected is the smallest size needed to meet the load within available options of the desired equipment line. 
(b) Standby equipment provided with controls and devices that allow such equipment to operate automatically only when the primary equipment is not operating.
(c) Multiple units of the same equipment type with combined capacities exceeding the design load and provided with controls that sequence or otherwise optimally control the operation of each unit based on load.

Jason,
 
Thanks for your insightful response.  To a large degree I concur.  You
encounter various situations out there as a design consultant, and you
need to understand the plans and needs of your client.  But surely you
recognize that there are some cases where over sizing is not required,
and the client may actually prefer to pay less up front and get a better
operating system than always be able to maintain set point under the
most extreme combination of conditions.  When maintaining perfect
environmental control is critical, then you must oversize accordingly,
but when it isn't, you may assign more priority to proper sizing, or, in
rare cases, under sizing.
 
I personally would prefer a slightly undersized AC system in my home to
an oversized one if I had to choose between the two.  I understand the
advantages, and prefer to risk having to tolerate a little discomfort
for a few hours a year than to pay for and operate an excessively
oversized system for the next 15 to 20 years.
 
But to offer this to a client may be risky business unless you get him
to sign a waiver, and then it is still risky.  On the other hand, if you
can determine the maximum probable system load and add a reasonable
10-25% to that, you will have satisfied the client's needs with a
reasonable margin of safety.  The only angry clients I have ever
encountered were angry because their system was failing to deliver a
significant amount of the time when circumstances were only normal, in
which cases the engineer had made a serious error and specified a system
that was grossly undersized.  I don't recommend over sizing to make
certain this doesn't happen.  Instead I recommend checking and double
checking your sizing calculations so you don't make such a mistake.
 
This is a hot issue because nearly every HVAC engineer is going to
sooner or later make that proverbial mistake, lose self-confidence, and
from then on join those that oversize their systems more than necessary
just to cover potential mistakes.  Most clients are none the wiser
anyhow, and, after it has all been paid for, some actually enjoy the
feeling of knowing they have a "honker of an air conditioner" that is
capable of cooling the place down in 60 seconds or less.  So what do we
have to lose?  I think it might be some of our own professional and
personal integrity!  Not much else comes to mind.
 
Now I have said too much, so I will bow out of this, knowing that last
paragraph may ruffle some feathers.
 
Glenn

Glenn,
 
For load sizing, over sizing equipment can be bad with them short
cycling and energy hogs.  But on the other hand under sizing a system
can be just as bad.  When you size equipment you normally can't select
equipment that will meet your building load exact so most engineers
normally go to the next size up in equipment. Very rare do I see or hear
any one pick the size down in equipment.  Its the nature of the beast.
Everyone has the fear of being sued from an owner it is easier to
oversize the equipment that way you have the extra capacity if you need
it, than having to deal with an angry owner.  
 
My view on energy simulation is like trying to kill a fly with a bullet.
Everyone is trying to predict exactly what a building will do and how it
will perform, and you just can't.  There are so may variables in an
energy simulation, some variables you can predict and even control and
other variables you just can't predict or possibly even know.  That is
why I believe it is important to relay the bases of your energy
simulation to whomever you are presenting it to.  That the simulation is
based on these parameters and based on these parameters this is how the
building should perform.  And then when the building is build and its
performance is better or worse than what you predicted then you can
compare the variables and see which ones are off and how bad.  And the
most common variables that is normally off is infiltration and weather.
But no one goes back to a building after it has been build to adjust
there model to see what was off.  And that is also the nature of the
beast as well.

Chris,

You make a good point, and it also can apply to centrifugal chillers,
which are sometimes most efficient at 60-80% loaded.  But you still have
to remember that the client has to pay for the larger equipment, which
costs more, plus larger system components (which cost more) and more
space (which costs more).

You also maake a good point about the system loads 90% of the time,
which raises an interesting question regarding sizing for optimum
operating efficiency.  What if we sized certain types of equipment to
meet the most predominant loads within their most efficient capacity
ranges?  That is not difficult when using hourly simulation software.
Of course, you have to keep an eye on peak loads and capacities.  I
haven't thought this through yet, but I'll bet someone else has.

Thanks,
Glenn

Glenn,

Oversize isn't always bad! A condensing boiler is generally at its most
efficient at < 20% of its capacity.

All the same, the mid-season is largely ignored when it comes to sizing.
Ridiculous really, when you think this is where the plant will be 90% of
the time.

Perhaps this is more of an issue when you are shifting large amounts of
chilled water to various pieces of zone equipment but has anybody
considered Valve Authority? Unfortunately my experience is limited when
it comes to the nitty gritty of piping networks. But, I do know one
thing: valve response is not linear, especially if there is a
substantial head in the system. My hunch is mid season control could get
really messed up if plant has spare capacity but designers haven't been
quite as generous with pipe sizes.

Such questions should be in the domain of simulation in the next few
years.

Dear All,

I want to have your opinions regarding how to approach modelling high rise
residential buildings. I believe there is much more here that is up to the
modeller to decide than office buildings. How do you determine occupant
schedules for example? Or lighting schedules for that matter?

Thanks,

Omer Moltay, Mimta Ltd.

I know how to do this, Omer, as do others. Since I am self-employed,
however, I can't give you much information for free. That being said, your
approach will first depend on where you are located on this beautiful,
imperiled planet. Let us know location, height, footprint, other uses in the
building, etc. Your HVAC zones can be justifiably based on N, S, E, W
exposures and a core. You will want to create your own schedules or default
to the ones that exist in eQUEST for high rise residential buildings. I
would create my own schedules so I would know what's there. I would use
multipliers wherever I can justify doing so. I would model stairs separately
if they are conditioned using a separate system. I would spend probably a
day with paper drawings looking at floor plans, elevations, wall sections,
reflected ceiling plans, wall sections, window details, etc., etc., in an
attempt to see all there is to be seen. I would attempt to very carefully
consider all the future alligators that might bite me. In eQUEST, as well as
other tools, it is easier to accommodate too many spaces and their thermal
zones, than too few. In other words, it is harder to add spaces/thermal
zones later than it is to deal with too many.

Now others can agree with me. Or not...

Peace to you and all,

Carol

Hi All,
                      In the Chilled water loop propeties  under process/DHW
load Tab it asks about process load in Mbtu/hr and process flow in gpm and
process delta T .I didnt get for what purpose this parameters are used. what
is this porcess load, is it the equipment load ,when i checked in DOE2 help
it says process load attached to chilled water loop this should be peak load
. and what is this process flow(it says flow associated with process load)

I am unclear with this answer can any elaborate this to me.

I look forward for your response.

Varkie,
 
I fully agree with you, and most of the following diatribe is not meant for you, but for the larger design community.  None the less, I invite you to correct me publicly where you believe I may have missed the boat.  I'm still learning!
 
When you can specify more than one cooling unit to meet the same load, you can afford to oversize a lot before energy efficiency is affected.  It's mainly the residential and small commercial sectors that concern me regarding excessive over sizing vs. efficiency and humidity control.
 
But in every case, more capacity costs the client (owner) more money, so proper sizing is important, especially during difficult economic times like these.  If you are like me, you tend to take ownership of the HVAC design, and costs may not be as important to you as they are to the client.  An excellent design may be rejected by the design team based on cost, and the easiest way to increase cost, along with the probability of rejection, is to oversize the systems.
 
With regard to sizing heating systems, I believe there is more leeway in terms of equipment (but not floor space or subsystems) costs, and the practical need for greater capacity is more common (morning warm-up after setback, for example).  A good design will consider the real capacity needs of the building without exceeding them more than necessary.  It's more difficult to define over sizing in the large C&I sector because proper sizing depends on more variables, so it comes back to the design engineer's integrity more often.  A highly skilled designer will tend to have more confidence in his ability (unless he has been "burned" a few times due to design errors) to calculate the real loads more accurately, considering all the variables.
 
One less confident (possibly including a highly skilled professional with burn scars) may tend to assume "conservatively" on all variables simultaneously, thus over-calculating the required loads, and then beef those up more than necessary.  Who, except another highly skilled (and brave, and independently wealthy) professional, is capable and willing to challenge this approach?  And even then it is one's opinion against another's.
 
If redundancy is needed (hospitals, for example), then there is still a practical limit to the need.  It just becomes more indeterminate, or more difficult to define.  This is where interaction with the design team is more critical; this time the HVAC designer needs to ask appropriate questions, listen carefully and offer verbal guidance to the team before he can properly size the systems.  We should not fail to consider that installation costs are always greater with larger systems, regardless of building sector.  All else being the same, this usually applies to O&M costs as well.  The integrity question is really this; "Do I mitigate my personal risk more through willful overdesign, or do I assign more value to the owner's financial objectives and/or limitations?"
 
To achieve a proper balance, the designer must first determine the true capacity requirements with accuracy and confidence, and then add only a modest oversize factor to that.  It isn't easy, but our choices here eventually establish our levels of self-respect and our professional reputations within the design community.
 
Glenn

Subject: Equipment Sizing



 

I changed the topic name to ?Equipment Sizing?.  I thought I would add my 2 cents worth also.  So now Bldg-Sim has 8 cents worth.

 

The first building project that I was associated was at the tail end of the M-E design at JB&B of the Federal Reserve Bank Building in Minneapolis.

http://www.lera.com/projects/ofc/federalreservemn.htm <http://www.lera.com/projects/ofc/federalreservemn.htm> 

The building opened in January (I think) in the early 70s.  ASHRAE winter design at 1% is -16 F.  When the building opened it was about -30 F (it can go down to -40 F there) with strong winds.  Occupants in the US are not dressed (with full arm and leg heavy woolen underwear) to tolerate low indoor temps even for one day.  

 

Summer design in Minneapolis at 1% is 92 DB 75 WB but the DB can exceed 100 F.  Occupants can tolerate a little discomfort on the few days that extreme summer conditions occur.  It?s still better than no AC.  Few, if any, buildings were air-conditioned, even in the US, before 1940.  The moral of this story is design for extreme winter conditions in very cold climates.  Judgment, experience, and common sense have to be applied.  It depends on the location.  In a place like Singapore the temp varies from a low of 75 F to 95 F all day and all year.   There are no extremes.  All buildings in tropical countries do not need heating systems.

 

Inefficient energy use occurs when there is only one unit of the equipment and it is oversized.  When there are two or more units, one unit starts until it reaches maximum, then second unit comes on and the two shares load.  The units are rarely operated at minimum load.  This is the default in DOE2 but LOAD-MANAGEMENT allows you to sequence the use of primary equipment in any way you want that is appropriate for the project.

 

The lighting and equipment design criteria was 5 watts /sf and 3 watts /sf for buildings designed before the energy crises in 1974.  No one cared about energy before then.  Actual lighting density was nowhere close, and there was very little equipment in offices.  This means for a million sqft building you end up with three chillers.  One is standby which comes into operation when a chiller fails or one chiller has to be shut down for maintenance.  Specifying standby primary equipment affects first costs and does not affect equipment efficiency.

 

Energy programs are for comparing alternative energy conservation measures.  There is no need to size equipment for occasional extreme weather conditions.  But I think auto-sizing is based on weather data (not design data or median weather data) so equipment is sized for the worst condition of that year.  This means at every other hour of the year the equipment is operating inefficiently at part load conditions.  Equipment sizes estimated by energy programs are used in the design process.

 

Equipment schedules in design documents are based on actual equipment selected from manufacturers catalogs.  The name of the manufacturer and the model number are specified and then ?or equal? added.  Equipment schedules are not based on design calculations or generic data because it is possible that real equipment cannot meet the performance data.  You need the dimensions of the equipment (with clearances for maintenance) to design them into the space.  TRACE energy program is based on actual real equipment performance data specified my model numbers.  HAP is based on real equipment, but they don?t mention model numbers.

 

I think the Code of Federal Regulations 10CFR434 (ENERGY CODE FOR NEW FEDERAL COMMERCIAL AND MULTI-FAMILY HIGH RISE RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS) used to allow you to size two identical units of primary equipment each at 66% of the maximum design.  This would be commercial buildings with large heating and cooling loads where you would have two units.  Perhaps it was a special case where failure to perform at all times was not an option.  I couldn?t find it the latest register.

http://www.wbdg.org/pdfs/10cfr434.pdf <http://www.wbdg.org/pdfs/10cfr434.pdf> 

 

10CFR434 - 403.2.2 Equipment and System Sizing.

Heating and cooling equipment and systems shall be sized to provide no more than the loads calculated in accordance with subsection 403.2.1. A single piece of equipment providing both heating and cooling must satisfy this provision for one function with the other function sized as small as possible to meet the load, within available equipment options. Exceptions are as follows:

(a) When the equipment selected is the smallest size needed to meet the load within available options of the desired equipment line. 

(b) Standby equipment provided with controls and devices that allow such equipment to operate automatically only when the primary equipment is not operating.

(c) Multiple units of the same equipment type with combined capacities exceeding the design load and provided with controls that sequence or otherwise optimally control the operation of each unit based on load.

All,

Should always be the goal but it is soooo hard to define. I have worked on
tiny commercial buildings as well as huge commercial buildings. All types.
Right sizing is always my goal and as far as I know is always the goal of
the ME's. It was mine when I did HVAC design work. Building occupants are
intolerant of too hot and too cold. And, in a building of any size with more
than one person in it you will find disagreement about whether it is too hot
or too cold at least some of the time. So what do you do? Especially if you
are just the hapless, overworked, under paid energy modeler? You can see my
project list if you want to. If you listen closely you will hear whatever
opinion you want to hear about me and my work. Thank god for VFDs, VRVs and

I think this is a wonderful time to be in the HVAC industry. New tools
are changing the outdated, over simplified tools and methods used in the
past (and present). I would like to make one comment on the below
message. The sentence "Building occupants are intolerant of too hot and
too cold."  This is one good example of the changing attitudes in the
building industry. Resent research suggest that this sentence should
really read " Building occupants with no control over their environment
are intolerant to too hot or too cold".  When occupants know they can
control their environment (maybe with a window) they will dress
accordingly and expand their comfort zone. 

On a "right sizing" note, I do believe if owners would like to get
aggressive and truly right size equipment they will also need to
shoulder the possible risks, i.e. 10 or 20 hours out of the year you may
not be able to keep  your cooling set point. Its energy modeling that
will quantity these risks and size these systems, not a side ruler and a
design day (hour).

 

This exchange has been a nice change of pace from locating weather
files. It's very interesting to learn other current points of view in
our industry,

My thought process-

I have had a few designs which had meeting rooms which could hold a large
number of people.  If I were to size the equipment for the max number of
people on the hottest day the equipment size would be a few tons larger.

Example.  A high school youth room in a church on the third (top) floor with
a max occupancy of 30 people.

My conclusion.  If 30 high school kids try to meet in that room at 4:00 p.m.
in the middle of summer, that room will get warm.... They should find another
room.  The sanctuary isn't likely going to be in use at 4:00.

There have been other meeting rooms I have used this line of thought. So far
I have only applied it to meeting rooms.  Simple, if you try to pack a
meeting room with people on a hottest day at the hottest part of the day, it
may get hot.  It isn't a poor design, it is using the 'art' of engineering.

Best advice.  Talk to the owner.  There is a lot of equipment sizing
reduction opportunity by finding the 'worse practical' design conditions as
opposed to the typical 'worst possible' conditions.

Two other examples of this which another designer shared with me.  
1. Schools don't usual hold classes in the summer.  Find the peak during
school months, not in July.  The design will typically be large enough to
handle summer school.  And this condition can be modeled to check.
2. Christmas and Easter are not in the summer.  And services are usually in
the morning.  A church typically has no need for a system to be designed for
100% at 4 p.m. in the summer.

(This doesn't help for LEED since you must use the same schedules as the
baseline, but it helps in actual energy savings.  This could actually hurt
you in LEED with UNMET hours if you don't modify your schedule to match your
assumptions.)

*I am really enjoying this sharing of information.  Thank you all.*

We are honored to invite Doug Hittle to lead our evening presentation
entitled, " Simulation Answers to Tough Questions: Proof by Anecdote."

 

Abstract: This discussion asserts that there are some architectural and
engineering questions concerning building and HVAC system designs that
aren't well answered using a handbook and calculator. I believe that the
IBPSA audience already embraces this hypothesis. This presentation shows
some interesting cases where design issues could not be answered without
computer models. Indeed, without computer calculations the questions
might not have even been asked in the first place or designers would
have had to rely on RE's.

 

Bio: Doug Hittle is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Mechanical

Taking this discussion back to energy simulation and its impact on
design.  Over-sizing systematically occurs but from an energy
perspective it is not always bad.  One of our jobs as energy modelers is
to identify the impacts of over-sizing and to drive the design to
maximum annual efficiency.   So if the designer is going to oversize the
pump, we need to try and quantify the savings potential of including a
VFD for balancing instead of using throttling valves.  If the designer
is going to oversize the boiler, we need to justify to the owner the
incremental costs for purchasing the most efficient boiler setup, which
could be a boiler with a high turndown ratio and oxygen trim controls or
multiple smaller boilers.

 

Also, we may want equipment/systems to be oversized in some situations.
Our job as modelers is to quantify the energy impacts of design
decisions, which may include over-sizing.  And what does over-sizing
always mean?  Should pipes be sized for 1, 2 or 3ft loss/100 ft, should
ducts be sized for , .1, .2, or .3 ft loss/100 ft, should air handler
coils be sized for 200 fpm or 400 fpm?  

 

Yes over-sizing costs money to the owner up front, but when designed,
installed, and operated correctly - in some situations over-sizing can
be the most efficient design with the most attractive life cycle cost.

I think this is a wonderful time to be in the HVAC industry. New tools
are changing the outdated, over simplified tools and methods used in the
past (and present). I would like to make one comment on the below
message. The sentence "Building occupants are intolerant of too hot and
too cold."  This is one good example of the changing attitudes in the
building industry. Resent research suggest that this sentence should
really read " Building occupants with no control over their environment
are intolerant to too hot or too cold".  When occupants know they can
control their environment (maybe with a window) they will dress
accordingly and expand their comfort zone. 

On a "right sizing" note, I do believe if owners would like to get
aggressive and truly right size equipment they will also need to
shoulder the possible risks, i.e. 10 or 20 hours out of the year you may
not be able to keep  your cooling set point. Its energy modeling that
will quantity these risks and size these systems, not a side ruler and a
design day (hour).

 

This exchange has been a nice change of pace from locating weather
files. It's very interesting to learn other current points of view in
our industry,

 

Best Regards,

 

Brad Acker, P.E.

All,

Should always be the goal but it is soooo hard to define. I have worked
on tiny commercial buildings as well as huge commercial buildings. All
types. Right sizing is always my goal and as far as I know is always the
goal of the ME's. It was mine when I did HVAC design work. Building
occupants are intolerant of too hot and too cold. And, in a building of
any size with more than one person in it you will find disagreement
about whether it is too hot or too cold at least some of the time. So
what do you do? Especially if you are just the hapless, overworked,
under paid energy modeler? You can see my project list if you want to.
If you listen closely you will hear whatever opinion you want to hear
about me and my work. Thank god for VFDs, VRVs and EC motors, eh?

Hi All,

I am considering enrolling in a program to advance myself as an energy
engineer, or energy manager. Are there any Masters engineering programs that
would be helpful for excelling in the field and improving my marketability?
Or perhaps individual classes, or even trade school? I have had just about a
year of experience in energy modeling and auditing, and would like to learn
relevant concepts more thoroughly. I appreciate any suggestions.

Oh yeah. My undergraduate is a B.S. in mechanical engineering. That might be
relevant.

Gary -- CEM certification is something I've considered, but I need a couple
years more of experience (to meet the required 3 years) before I can
actually attempt it.

Saleh -- Thanks for the link. I was hoping there was ideally something I
could take in-state as an Ohio resident, but relocation is something I may
have to think about.

Hello, All.

 

After perusing Appendix G and the LEED book, I've been unable to find
the answer to this one:

 

If I've got a project that's using a Air-cooled Chiller, what baseline
chiller do I use?  Appendix G says to use 2 equally sized Screw
Chillers.  But, it doesn't say if these have to be air-cooled or water
cooled.  I'd imagine there's quite a benefit to compare with a water
cooled, when you take into account the cooling tower, etc.

 

Any ideas if this is alright?

Marty,

You are probably referring to Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1-2004. It is about water-cooled chillers: it is implicit in the System-Specific Baseline HVAC System Requirements.

This has been corrected in the 2007 version, which now states explicitly "water-cooled".

Section G3.1.3.11 Heat Rejection (Systems 7 and 8) tells you that "the heat rejection device shall be an axial fan cooling tower with two speed fans." It does not matter what type of chiller you have in the proposed design, if your system type requires a chiller, it is water-cooled.

both knees. Yes to training, but *if* I train you, you will need to be
willing to spend time looking at paper drawings and discussing zoning first.
You can use Autocad at the same time or not.

My rates are: $150 for 8 hours or less, $125 for 8-16 hours, $100 for
anything over 16 hours. This is not marketing it is question answering. If
anyone is offended so be it. AS I said before, I would rather train by
researching and answering questions

I am physically located in Portland, Or. I require humor!

Helo Brad,

I am not too sure where you are located.  However, here in Toronto, there is
a Masters Degree in Energy Engineering.  Professional Engineers of Ontario
is offering it in collaboration with a number of universities.  You can
contact PEO and get more info on that.

All,

Has anyone tried implementing evaporative cooling with chilled beams (induction units) in eQuest?

If I implement Indirect/Direct in the VAV System that supplies the outside air to the chilled beam zones I get a massive increase in fan energy (about 10 times).

If I implement it in the Induction Unit system itself, I get a NAN error in the BEPS report. 

Any help would be appreciated,

Fred

I am attempting to create an interior window to allow solar gains to
pass through a sunspace to an adjacent space. I am getting to the
following warning when attempting to create a window component on the
interior wall.

 

 

 

As a work around I changed the wall to EXTERIOR-WALL in order to add the
windows then planned on changing back to INTERIOR-WALL but when I open
the project I get a warning saying "A PARENT EXTERIOR-WALL must be
defined before .."

 

I know you can create interior windows and use them in conjunction with
sunspaces as the DOE2 manual specifically calls out this scenario. 

 

What am I doing wrong?

Alan,  

 

To my understanding, you simply cannot put a window on an interior wall.
The best approximation may be as follows:

1.       Keep the internal wall in it's entirety - this will model heat
transfer to the adjoining space correctly... if it's a large internal
window consider adjusting the internal partition's properties to match
the effective thermal mass/U-value.

2.       Create a new external wall, of any construction layers, on top
of the interior wall with the exact (maybe rounded) area of the window

3.       Create a window on that exterior wall with that exact area and
with matching properties to the real glazing with one exception:  Give
it a ridiculously low U-value to effectively eliminate what would be the
modeled thermal transfer interactions with the exterior.

4.       Assign window shades to model the solar shading effects of the
adjacent space (ceiling/walls).

 

Best of luck!

 

~Nick

Sunspace Elements

 Sunspace Elements

Interior Windows

Interior windows can be specified by following an INTERIOR-WALL command by
one or more WINDOW commands.  Interior walls can have windows. The keywords
for interior windows are the same as those for exterior windows, with some
exceptions:

1.     The following keywords are unused:

FRAME-WIDTH                   SETBACK
GLARE-CTRL-PROB             SHADING-DIVISION
GLASS-TYPE-SW                SWITCH-CONTROL
GND-FORM-FACTOR           SWITCH-SCH
INF-COEF                          SWITCH-SET-HI
LEFT-FIN-A, etc.                SWITCH-SET-LO
OVERHANG-A, etc.             VIS-TRANS-SCH
RIGHT-FIN-A, etc.              WIN-SHADE-TYPE

2.     SKY-FORM-FACTOR multiplies the total diffuse radiation incident on an
interior window.  If the interior window has a setback (relative to the
sunspace) or there are obstructions inside the sunspace that shade the interior
window, a value of SKY-FORM-FACTOR less than 1.0 should be specified (the
default value is 1.0).

Shading devices on interior windows, like Venetian blinds, drapes, or
pull-down shades, can be simulated via the keywords SHADING-SCHEDULE and
MAX-SOLAR-SCH.  Movable insulation on interior windows can be modeled using
keywords CONDUCT-SCHEDULE and CONDUCT-TMIN-SCH.

For an accurate calculation of the solar radiation transmitted by a sunspace
interior window, it is important to specify the X and Y coordinates of the
window.  These coordinates are measured with respect to the lower-left hand
corner of the INTERIOR-WALL as viewed in the NEXT-TO space (see ?INTERIOR-WALL
Command? in the *DOE-2.2 Dictionary*). The position of exterior
windowsshould also be carefully specified. The program will only
recognize interior
windows in an interior wall between a sunspace and a non-sunspace.

Sliding glass doors can be modeled as interior windows.  If the
interiorwall containing the glass door has AIR-FLOW-TYPE =
FREE-DOORWAY (see
WALL-PARAMETERS, below), the door will be assumed to be open and convection
through the opening will be calculated if T(sunspace) - T(adjacent space) >
AIR-FLOW-CTRL-DT.

Additional control of the opening and closing of the door can be obtained by
using SS-FLOW-SCH (see description of ZONE keywords, below).

An unglazed opening in a sunspace interior wall can be input as a
windowwith GLASS-TYPE-CODE = 0. The program will calculate the solar
radiation
passing through the opening by using a transmittance of 1.0 for all angles
of incidence. WALL-PARAMETERS data, described below, would be entered for
the INTERIOR-WALL to specify the convective air flow through the opening.

Interior Doors

Unlike exterior walls, interior walls in cannot have doors.  However, an
opaque interior door with a conductance significantly different from the
sunspace interior wall containing it can be input as a separate
interiorwall.  Alternatively, the door can simply be ignored if the
conduction
across it is small compared to the overall conduction across the wall.  The
program will calculate convection through a fully or partially open door if
AIR-FLOW-TYPE = FREE-DOORWAY and appropriate values of DOORWAY-H and
DOORWAY-W are specified (see WALL-PARAMETERS, below).

Use Glass Type not Shading Coefficient for Sunspaces

You should use GLASS-TYPE-CODE rather than SHADING-COEF for sunspace
exterior windows. This allows the program to accurately calculate the hourly
direct and diffuse radiation transmitted by the glazing.  This is not
possible with SHADING-COEF except for standard 1/8" clear glass.

Use Custom Weighting Factors for Sunspaces

Custom Weighting Factors (CWFs) should be used for sunspaces for several
reasons:

1.     For high conductance spaces, the precalculated (ASHRAE) weighting
factors overestimate heating and cooling loads.  The overestimate can be as
high as 25-30% for heavily glazed spaces.

2.     CWFs account for loss of solar gain due to reflection of sunlight
back out of exterior windows.

3.     CWFs give a more accurate calculation of the generally large
temperature swings in a solar-driven space.

4.     CWFs will automatically be calculated for any space with FLOOR-WEIGHT
= 0 (the default value).  Otherwise, the program will use ASHRAE weighting
factors.

Positioning Surfaces

For an accurate calculation of solar radiation falling on the interior walls
of a sunspace, the bounding surfaces of the sunspace need to be
geometrically positioned. This applies to the exterior walls and roofs and
their associated windows, and the interior walls and their associated
windows. We recommend that a sunspace interior wall be defined in the
sunspace rather than in the adjacent room.  Otherwise, the adjacent room
must be properly located with respect to the sunspace.  If this is not done,
the interior walls and windows will be mispositioned relative to the
sunspace exterior windows, and the projection of solar radiation from the
windows onto the interior walls will be incorrect.  This will give a wrong
calculation of the solar radiation transferred from sunspace to room.  Even
in this case, there will be no fictitious overall solar gain or loss since
the solar that stays in the sunspace plus that transferred to adjacent rooms
is constrained by the program to equal that entering the sunspace.  There
will, however, be an error message if the transferred solar exceeds the
entering solar, which would give a net negative solar gain in the sunspace.
This may occur if interior walls or windows on them overlap, if a multiplier
is used on an interior window, or if a multiplier is used on rooms adjacent
to a sunspace.

Massive Interior Walls

Sunspace interior walls are often fairly heavy, leading to a significant
time delay in the heat transfer across them by conduction.  Such walls
should be described by response factors, i.e., with a delayed-type
construction.

The order of defining layers in a delayed interior wall is from "outside" to
"inside", where "outside" is the side of the wall in the NEXT-TO space, and
"inside" is the side in the space in which the wall was defined. If, as
recommended, the interior wall is defined in the sunspace, then the outside
of the wall is the side in the adjacent room.

Delayed conduction through interior walls is calculated only for sunspace
interior walls. For other interior walls the hourly conduction is quick.

Delayed conduction through an interior between two non-sunspaces can be
obtained simply by assigning SUNSPACE = YES to one of the spaces, even
though the space is not actually a sunspace.  In this case, If the solar
flux on the "sunspace" side of the wall is small, it is recommended that
INSIDE-SOL-ABS = (0,0) be input for the wall in order to zero out absorption
of solar radiation.  Otherwise, all interior and exterior walls and
windowsin the "sunspace" should be geometrically positioned as
described above in
"Positioning of Sunspace Surfaces".

Moisture from Plants and Trees

Atriums often have plants and trees. Moisture transpiring from leaves and
evaporating from soil can produce a significant latent load. You can model
this load using the source keywords in SPACE as follows:

   SOURCE-TYPE        = PROCESS
SOURCE-LATENT      = 1.0
SOURCE-SENSIBLE    = 0.0
SOURCE-POWER       = [latent load in Btu/hr or W]
SOURCE-SCHEDULE    = U-name of schedule

Baffles and Louvers

Baffles and louvers on sunspace exterior windows, which block and/or diffuse
incoming beam radiation, can be modeled as blinds using the WINDOW-LAYERS
keyword in the WINDOW command. See ?Window Layers Method? in the
Windowtopic. The blinds can be
interior, exterior or between pane. They can be controlled in different ways
to manage solar gain.

I stand happily corrected!

 

If I could go back in time, I'd tell myself to ask more questions like

Sunspace Elements


Interior Windows

Interior windows can be specified by following an INTERIOR-WALL command
by one or more WINDOW commands.  Interior walls can have windows. The
keywords for interior windows are the same as those for exterior
windows, with some exceptions:

1.     The following keywords are unused:

FRAME-WIDTH                   SETBACK
GLARE-CTRL-PROB             SHADING-DIVISION
GLASS-TYPE-SW                SWITCH-CONTROL
GND-FORM-FACTOR           SWITCH-SCH
INF-COEF                          SWITCH-SET-HI
LEFT-FIN-A, etc.                SWITCH-SET-LO
OVERHANG-A, etc.             VIS-TRANS-SCH
RIGHT-FIN-A, etc.              WIN-SHADE-TYPE

2.     SKY-FORM-FACTOR multiplies the total diffuse radiation incident
on an interior window.  If the interior window has a setback (relative
to the sunspace) or there are obstructions inside the sunspace that
shade the interior window, a value of SKY-FORM-FACTOR less than 1.0
should be specified (the default value is 1.0).

Shading devices on interior windows, like Venetian blinds, drapes, or
pull-down shades, can be simulated via the keywords SHADING-SCHEDULE and
MAX-SOLAR-SCH.  Movable insulation on interior windows can be modeled
using keywords CONDUCT-SCHEDULE and CONDUCT-TMIN-SCH.

For an accurate calculation of the solar radiation transmitted by a
sunspace interior window, it is important to specify the X and Y
coordinates of the window.  These coordinates are measured with respect
to the lower-left hand corner of the INTERIOR-WALL as viewed in the
NEXT-TO space (see "INTERIOR-WALL Command" in the DOE-2.2 Dictionary).
The position of exterior windows should also be carefully specified. The
program will only recognize interior windows in an interior wall between
a sunspace and a non-sunspace.

Sliding glass doors can be modeled as interior windows.  If the interior
wall containing the glass door has AIR-FLOW-TYPE = FREE-DOORWAY (see
WALL-PARAMETERS, below), the door will be assumed to be open and
convection through the opening will be calculated if T(sunspace) -
T(adjacent space) > AIR-FLOW-CTRL-DT.

Additional control of the opening and closing of the door can be
obtained by using SS-FLOW-SCH (see description of ZONE keywords, below).

An unglazed opening in a sunspace interior wall can be input as a window
with GLASS-TYPE-CODE = 0. The program will calculate the solar radiation
passing through the opening by using a transmittance of 1.0 for all
angles of incidence. WALL-PARAMETERS data, described below, would be
entered for the INTERIOR-WALL to specify the convective air flow through
the opening.

Interior Doors

Unlike exterior walls, interior walls in cannot have doors.  However, an
opaque interior door with a conductance significantly different from the
sunspace interior wall containing it can be input as a separate interior
wall.  Alternatively, the door can simply be ignored if the conduction
across it is small compared to the overall conduction across the wall.
The program will calculate convection through a fully or partially open
door if AIR-FLOW-TYPE = FREE-DOORWAY and appropriate values of DOORWAY-H
and DOORWAY-W are specified (see WALL-PARAMETERS, below).

Use Glass Type not Shading Coefficient for Sunspaces

You should use GLASS-TYPE-CODE rather than SHADING-COEF for sunspace
exterior windows. This allows the program to accurately calculate the
hourly direct and diffuse radiation transmitted by the glazing.  This is
not possible with SHADING-COEF except for standard 1/8" clear glass.

Use Custom Weighting Factors for Sunspaces

Custom Weighting Factors (CWFs) should be used for sunspaces for several
reasons:

1.     For high conductance spaces, the precalculated (ASHRAE) weighting
factors overestimate heating and cooling loads.  The overestimate can be
as high as 25-30% for heavily glazed spaces.

2.     CWFs account for loss of solar gain due to reflection of sunlight
back out of exterior windows.

3.     CWFs give a more accurate calculation of the generally large
temperature swings in a solar-driven space.

4.     CWFs will automatically be calculated for any space with
FLOOR-WEIGHT = 0 (the default value).  Otherwise, the program will use
ASHRAE weighting factors.

Positioning Surfaces

For an accurate calculation of solar radiation falling on the interior
walls of a sunspace, the bounding surfaces of the sunspace need to be
geometrically positioned. This applies to the exterior walls and roofs
and their associated windows, and the interior walls and their
associated windows. We recommend that a sunspace interior wall be
defined in the sunspace rather than in the adjacent room.  Otherwise,
the adjacent room must be properly located with respect to the sunspace.
If this is not done, the interior walls and windows will be
mispositioned relative to the sunspace exterior windows, and the
projection of solar radiation from the windows onto the interior walls
will be incorrect.  This will give a wrong calculation of the solar
radiation transferred from sunspace to room.  Even in this case, there
will be no fictitious overall solar gain or loss since the solar that
stays in the sunspace plus that transferred to adjacent rooms is
constrained by the program to equal that entering the sunspace.  There
will, however, be an error message if the transferred solar exceeds the
entering solar, which would give a net negative solar gain in the
sunspace.  This may occur if interior walls or windows on them overlap,
if a multiplier is used on an interior window, or if a multiplier is
used on rooms adjacent to a sunspace.

Massive Interior Walls

Sunspace interior walls are often fairly heavy, leading to a significant
time delay in the heat transfer across them by conduction.  Such walls
should be described by response factors, i.e., with a delayed-type
construction.

The order of defining layers in a delayed interior wall is from
"outside" to "inside", where "outside" is the side of the wall in the
NEXT-TO space, and "inside" is the side in the space in which the wall
was defined. If, as recommended, the interior wall is defined in the
sunspace, then the outside of the wall is the side in the adjacent room.

Delayed conduction through interior walls is calculated only for
sunspace interior walls. For other interior walls the hourly conduction
is quick.

Delayed conduction through an interior between two non-sunspaces can be
obtained simply by assigning SUNSPACE = YES to one of the spaces, even
though the space is not actually a sunspace.  In this case, If the solar
flux on the "sunspace" side of the wall is small, it is recommended that
INSIDE-SOL-ABS = (0,0) be input for the wall in order to zero out
absorption of solar radiation.  Otherwise, all interior and exterior
walls and windows in the "sunspace" should be geometrically positioned
as described above in "Positioning of Sunspace Surfaces".

Moisture from Plants and Trees

Atriums often have plants and trees. Moisture transpiring from leaves
and evaporating from soil can produce a significant latent load. You can
model this load using the source keywords in SPACE as follows:

   SOURCE-TYPE        = PROCESS
SOURCE-LATENT      = 1.0
SOURCE-SENSIBLE    = 0.0
SOURCE-POWER       = [latent load in Btu/hr or W]
SOURCE-SCHEDULE    = U-name of schedule

Baffles and Louvers

Baffles and louvers on sunspace exterior windows, which block and/or
diffuse incoming beam radiation, can be modeled as blinds using the
WINDOW-LAYERS keyword in the WINDOW command. See "Window Layers Method"
in the Window topic. The blinds can be interior, exterior or between
pane. They can be controlled in different ways to manage solar gain.

Alan,  

 

To my understanding, you simply cannot put a window on an interior wall.
The best approximation may be as follows:

1.       Keep the internal wall in it's entirety - this will model heat
transfer to the adjoining space correctly... if it's a large internal
window consider adjusting the internal partition's properties to match
the effective thermal mass/U-value.

2.       Create a new external wall, of any construction layers, on top
of the interior wall with the exact (maybe rounded) area of the window

3.       Create a window on that exterior wall with that exact area and
with matching properties to the real glazing with one exception:  Give
it a ridiculously low U-value to effectively eliminate what would be the
modeled thermal transfer interactions with the exterior.

4.       Assign window shades to model the solar shading effects of the
adjacent space (ceiling/walls).

 

Best of luck!

I am attempting to create an interior window to allow solar gains to
pass through a sunspace to an adjacent space. I am getting to the
following warning when attempting to create a window component on the
interior wall.

 

 

 

As a work around I changed the wall to EXTERIOR-WALL in order to add the
windows then planned on changing back to INTERIOR-WALL but when I open
the project I get a warning saying "A PARENT EXTERIOR-WALL must be
defined before .."

 

I know you can create interior windows and use them in conjunction with
sunspaces as the DOE2 manual specifically calls out this scenario. 

 

What am I doing wrong?

Sunspace Elements


Interior Windows

Interior windows can be specified by following an INTERIOR-WALL command
by one or more WINDOW commands.  Interior walls can have windows. The
keywords for interior windows are the same as those for exterior
windows, with some exceptions:

1.     The following keywords are unused:

FRAME-WIDTH                   SETBACK
GLARE-CTRL-PROB             SHADING-DIVISION
GLASS-TYPE-SW                SWITCH-CONTROL
GND-FORM-FACTOR           SWITCH-SCH
INF-COEF                          SWITCH-SET-HI
LEFT-FIN-A, etc.                SWITCH-SET-LO
OVERHANG-A, etc.             VIS-TRANS-SCH
RIGHT-FIN-A, etc.              WIN-SHADE-TYPE

2.     SKY-FORM-FACTOR multiplies the total diffuse radiation incident
on an interior window.  If the interior window has a setback (relative
to the sunspace) or there are obstructions inside the sunspace that
shade the interior window, a value of SKY-FORM-FACTOR less than 1.0
should be specified (the default value is 1.0).

Shading devices on interior windows, like Venetian blinds, drapes, or
pull-down shades, can be simulated via the keywords SHADING-SCHEDULE and
MAX-SOLAR-SCH.  Movable insulation on interior windows can be modeled
using keywords CONDUCT-SCHEDULE and CONDUCT-TMIN-SCH.

For an accurate calculation of the solar radiation transmitted by a
sunspace interior window, it is important to specify the X and Y
coordinates of the window.  These coordinates are measured with respect
to the lower-left hand corner of the INTERIOR-WALL as viewed in the
NEXT-TO space (see "INTERIOR-WALL Command" in the DOE-2.2 Dictionary).
The position of exterior windows should also be carefully specified. The
program will only recognize interior windows in an interior wall between
a sunspace and a non-sunspace.

Sliding glass doors can be modeled as interior windows.  If the interior
wall containing the glass door has AIR-FLOW-TYPE = FREE-DOORWAY (see
WALL-PARAMETERS, below), the door will be assumed to be open and
convection through the opening will be calculated if T(sunspace) -
T(adjacent space) > AIR-FLOW-CTRL-DT.

Additional control of the opening and closing of the door can be
obtained by using SS-FLOW-SCH (see description of ZONE keywords, below).

An unglazed opening in a sunspace interior wall can be input as a window
with GLASS-TYPE-CODE = 0. The program will calculate the solar radiation
passing through the opening by using a transmittance of 1.0 for all
angles of incidence. WALL-PARAMETERS data, described below, would be

the opening.

opaque interior door with a conductance significantly different from the
sunspace interior wall containing it can be input as a separate interior

The program will calculate convection through a fully or partially open
door if AIR-FLOW-TYPE = FREE-DOORWAY and appropriate values of DOORWAY-H
and DOORWAY-W are specified (see WALL-PARAMETERS, below).

Use Glass Type not Shading Coefficient for Sunspaces

You should use GLASS-TYPE-CODE rather than SHADING-COEF for sunspace
exterior windows. This allows the program to accurately calculate the
hourly direct and diffuse radiation transmitted by the glazing.  This is
not possible with SHADING-COEF except for standard 1/8" clear glass.

Use Custom Weighting Factors for Sunspaces

Custom Weighting Factors (CWFs) should be used for sunspaces for several
reasons:

1.     For high conductance spaces, the precalculated (ASHRAE) weighting
factors overestimate heating and cooling loads.  The overestimate can be
as high as 25-30% for heavily glazed spaces.

2.     CWFs account for loss of solar gain due to reflection of sunlight
back out of exterior windows.

3.     CWFs give a more accurate calculation of the generally large
temperature swings in a solar-driven space.

4.     CWFs will automatically be calculated for any space with
FLOOR-WEIGHT = 0 (the default value).  Otherwise, the program will use
ASHRAE weighting factors.

Positioning Surfaces

For an accurate calculation of solar radiation falling on the interior
walls of a sunspace, the bounding surfaces of the sunspace need to be
geometrically positioned. This applies to the exterior walls and roofs
and their associated windows, and the interior walls and their
associated windows. We recommend that a sunspace interior wall be
defined in the sunspace rather than in the adjacent room.  Otherwise,
the adjacent room must be properly located with respect to the sunspace.
If this is not done, the interior walls and windows will be
mispositioned relative to the sunspace exterior windows, and the
projection of solar radiation from the windows onto the interior walls
will be incorrect.  This will give a wrong calculation of the solar
radiation transferred from sunspace to room.  Even in this case, there
will be no fictitious overall solar gain or loss since the solar that
stays in the sunspace plus that transferred to adjacent rooms is

will, however, be an error message if the transferred solar exceeds the
entering solar, which would give a net negative solar gain in the
sunspace.  This may occur if interior walls or windows on them overlap,
if a multiplier is used on an interior window, or if a multiplier is

time delay in the heat transfer across them by conduction.  Such walls
should be described by response factors, i.e., with a delayed-type

flux on the "sunspace" side of the wall is small, it is recommended that
INSIDE-SOL-ABS = (0,0) be input for the wall in order to zero out
absorption of solar radiation.  Otherwise, all interior and exterior
walls and windows in the "sunspace" should be geometrically positioned
as described above in "Positioning of Sunspace Surfaces".

Moisture from Plants and Trees

Atriums often have plants and trees. Moisture transpiring from leaves
and evaporating from soil can produce a significant latent load. You can
model this load using the source keywords in SPACE as follows:

   SOURCE-TYPE        = PROCESS
SOURCE-LATENT      = 1.0
SOURCE-SENSIBLE    = 0.0
SOURCE-POWER       = [latent load in Btu/hr or W]
SOURCE-SCHEDULE    = U-name of schedule

Baffles and Louvers

Baffles and louvers on sunspace exterior windows, which block and/or
diffuse incoming beam radiation, can be modeled as blinds using the
WINDOW-LAYERS keyword in the WINDOW command. See "Window Layers Method"
in the Window topic. The blinds can be interior, exterior or between
pane. They can be controlled in different ways to manage solar gain.

Alan,  

 

To my understanding, you simply cannot put a window on an interior wall.
The best approximation may be as follows:

1.       Keep the internal wall in it's entirety - this will model heat
transfer to the adjoining space correctly... if it's a large internal
window consider adjusting the internal partition's properties to match
the effective thermal mass/U-value.

2.       Create a new external wall, of any construction layers, on top
of the interior wall with the exact (maybe rounded) area of the window

3.       Create a window on that exterior wall with that exact area and
with matching properties to the real glazing with one exception:  Give
it a ridiculously low U-value to effectively eliminate what would be the
modeled thermal transfer interactions with the exterior.

4.       Assign window shades to model the solar shading effects of the
adjacent space (ceiling/walls).

 

Best of luck!

I am attaching the pd2 and inp, just so someone can confirm they get the

I am attempting to create an interior window to allow solar gains to
pass through a sunspace to an adjacent space. I am getting to the
following warning when attempting to create a window component on the
interior wall.

 

 

 

As a work around I changed the wall to EXTERIOR-WALL in order to add the
windows then planned on changing back to INTERIOR-WALL but when I open
the project I get a warning saying "A PARENT EXTERIOR-WALL must be
defined before .."

 

I know you can create interior windows and use them in conjunction with
sunspaces as the DOE2 manual specifically calls out this scenario. 

 

What am I doing wrong?

Hi Brad,

I think that you have a lot of good choices. In addition to Univ. of
Colorado and Penn State, there are very good programs at Texas A&M, Univ
of Kansas, University of Wisconsin, Colorado State, Arizona State
University and Purdue University. I am sure there are more, but those
are the ones I can think of off the top of my head.

 

Good luck,

Shanta Tucker

Hi Brad,
You could also try Oklahoma State University and work under Dr. Daniel
Fisher- He is one of the main developers for EnergyPlus. I have personally
done my Masters under his guidance in Energyplus and have myself been a
developer for EnergyPlus and wrote the Mixed air (Economizer) module in it.
The course work in HVAC is also very profound at Okstate!!

Brad and Anyone with an Interest

 

The University of Illinois at Chicago, Department of Mechanical and
Industrial Engineering, began offering a Masters in Energy Engineering
Degree in 2008.  This program is designed to be a Professional Development
program, focusing on applied courses, and structured to  serve working
engineers wishing to enter or extend their capabilities within the Energy
Industry.  This non-thesis degree requires 8 courses taken from a list of 10
courses - all designed for the program:

.         HVAC Design 

.         Power Generation 

.         Basics of Energy Engineering and Auditing

.         Engines

.         Combined Heat and Power 

.         Energy Efficient Design 

.         Advanced and Renewable Energy Engineering

.         Management of Engineering Projects

.         Nuclear Power Generation

.         Air Pollution

Courses feature a practical real world focus with instructors and guest
speakers from the industry.  Courses are all presented in the evening, and
each course is offered on a yearly basis - either in the spring or fall
semester.

 

Thus far, the program has enrolled over 70 active students and involves some
of the largest energy -oriented employers in Illinois.  I am attaching a
brochure on the program.  If attachments are not passed forward in the
Bldg-Sim system - please contact at the e-mail address or Phone number below

Message-ID: <C5E1527F129BF545A250B5AD0B0C26EF071217CD@ENTWEXMB0000000.university.harvard.edu>

My apologies for any cross postings.

 

Dear all:

 

Some of you and/or your associates might be interested in a three day
executive education program on 'Daylighting Buildings' that we will be
offering on July 14-16 2010 at Harvard University, Graduate School of
Design. During the three days we will be covering a range of daylighting
design analysis techniques ranging from rules of thumb to
state-of-the-art Radiance simulations and high dynamic range photography
for glare analysis. The main simulation programs used will be
Rhinoceros, SketchUp, and/or Ecotect for CAD modeling as well as
Radiance, Daysim, Evalglare, and Photosphere for climate-based daylight
modeling, glare analysis and solar radiation assessments. To those who
know Grasshopper, we will be showing you how to generate animated
Radiance/Daysim simulations such as the ones on our web site
http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/ABPS.html. Program
participants will further get a paper copy of a new, 50 page document on
daylight simulations. You can sign up for the program at
http://execed.gsd.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/exec_ed/details.cgi?offering_id=10
1838. Feel free to contact me for any content-related questions. Please
contact Ms. Margaret Moore De Chicojay
(margaret_moore_dechicojay at harvard.edu) for any administrational
question.

 

FYI. There was a long debate on climate-based daylighting metrics at a
recent two day Daylighting Forum in Las Vegas which was attended by
representative from IESNA, AHSRAE, USGBC and other organizations. It
seems likely that some of these organizations will soon introduce such
metrics into their standards and guidelines. So, sign up and stay
competitive.

Can someone informed, please suggest

a) how this may be best input in eQuest, and:
b) importantly, how it may be verified in the output. 

As in real life the amount of ventilation (used/modeled) has a
considerable energy impact and needs to be particularly accurate.

I see the DCV Zone sensors options, and have read the zone/system
ventilation help, but I find the help descriptions somewhat ambiguous.

In this example the system is constant volume roof top units with heat
recovery. Unoccupied control is cycling fans with no ventilation.

Thanks

Hi Darren,

I suspect you mean Desktop Radiance. As far as I know that is really old 
software and has not been supported for years. Why don't you install a 
current release of Radiance?

Cheer, Lars.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] How to model a VAV-system with TRNSYS
Message-ID: <000f01caffe5$4fbd9a60$ef38cf20$@net>

How can I model a VAV-system for different zones with TRNSYS (15/16/17)? Is
there a tutorial or example? 

 

Is there a certain type, which works together with the building model Type
56? 

 

At the moment I do a work-around, but I think results won?t be as accurate
as they should.

I divide the model in to real part and a fictive part. The real model is
supplied with the minimum outdoor air rate and a fixed temperature. The
heating or cooling load make the QHEAT and QCOOL (output of Type 56). 

Then I calculate the necessary mass flow of air which is needed to provide
the load calculated as QHEAT and QCOOL. Then I can calculate the real
fan-power. I think the operative temperature is wrong because in reality
more air enters the room and I?m always one time-step behind. If I have
several zones needing different supply temperatures it becomes complicated..

 

So I would really appreciate if somebody could help me! Maybe it would also
help me if you describe how other simulation-programs handle it.

 

Thanks

 

Chrisb!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Specific power demand in Hospitals
Message-ID: <DD3DA4F73A34504192AE88E0279499EA2353A77A77@ESSTH036.sweco.se>

Hi!

I?m working as an energy engineer with a new hospital in Sweden with high requirements on secure power supply. The suggested solution for uninterruptable power supply will be a flywheel-system (and diesel engines) which according to the manufacture will give a lot of power losses in transformation and regulation devices connected to the flywheel. Just to be sure that the system is dimensioned appropriate I?m looking for figures about power demand for Hospitals (total and part connected to the UPS), presented as W/sq. meters or W/sq ft.

In this particular case the power demand is calculated to about 60 W/sq meter (everything connected to the UPS-system). Other hospitals in Sweden have demands about 35-45 W/sq m. of which about 50 % is connected to uninterruptable supply.

Thank you in advance!

Regards Fredrik Karlsson

Subject: [Bldg-sim] su2ds -- Sketchup plug-in for Daysim analysis
Message-ID: <AANLkTinQteDdRVNijdV_93hBguGJJcmT55OR5Uxx7DSH@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all;

Su2ds is a Sketchup plug-in that's been developed to facilitate the analysis
of Sketchup geometry using Daysim. The plug-in allows users to specify all
of the model information necessary to conduct a Daysim analysis and display
the results of that analysis, all within Sketchup.

It can be downloaded, for free, here:

http://code.google.com/p/su2ds/

A small manual describing the plug-in's use can also be found at the above
link.

This the first public release of the plug-in and because of that (and my
amateurish programming skills) the software likely has bugs. If you find
any, you can report them in the "issues" section of the website, or email me
at jkjenner (at) manascisaac.com. As well, I would appreciate any
suggestions or comments anyone has on the plug-in (or manual) in general.

Enjoy!

Josh
