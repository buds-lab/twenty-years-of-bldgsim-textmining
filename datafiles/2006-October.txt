Chris,
 
We ran into a similar question on a LEED C&S project in Seattle. We submitted a CIR to USGBC to allow for energy savings, after the construction, for a TI build-out to code. In our case, the lighting power density would, by Seattle code, be less than the LPD for ASHRAE code. Because the maximum LPD would be code-required, and because this LPD is less than the ASHRAE standard, the savings was allowed.  Here is the text of the CIR and subsequent ruling.
 
CIR submission:
 
We are performing energy modeling for [Seattle] Core & Shell ...projects according to the requirements for version 2.1 of the LEED-CS Rating System. Our question pertains to future tenant improvements for the lighting systems. 
 
Since it is a tenant improvement, the future lighting system is not currently being designed. However, we propose that the lighting power densities in the Design Energy Cost model be set to Washington State Energy Code (WSEC) maximum allowable values. The tenants will have to meet the WSEC for the lighting design. Since these lighting levels are lower than those in ASHRAE 90.1-99, the building will see additional energy savings over the ASHRAE code.
 
The Energy Cost Budget will be modeled to ASHRAE 90.1-1999 following the space-by-space method. This approach will also keep from mixing and matching between ASHRAE and state code for the baseline model. 
 
We believe that using the WSEC for the lighting design would be a reasonable approach. If the lighting design had been completed by the design group, the lighting levels would be less than or equal to the WSEC in order to be compliant. Therefore, the WSEC maximum lighting power density would represent the most conservative design to be installed after the tenant improvements are complete. 

If our proposal is accepted, the following lighting power density values would be used:

Space Type           ECB        DEC

Retail                  1.9 W/sf    1.5 W/sf

Office-open plan        1.3 W/sf    1.0 W/sf

Main Floor Lobby        1.8 W/sf    1.2 W/sf

Other Elevator Lobbies  1.8 W/sf    0.8 W/sf

Draft RULING:

This is acceptable. The Core and Shell Energy Modeling Guidelines are developed with ASHRAE 90.1 as the referenced standard for both the Energy Cost Budget (ECB) and the Design Energy Cost (DEC) to ensure a minimum standard for the lighting power density in spaces that are outside of the control of the owner/developer. Because tenant buildout (not in the control of the owner/developer) will be required by local or regional regulations

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] LEED Core&Shell simulation and lighting


I am a bit fuzzy on how to define the design and budget building lighting loads for LEED C&S.  With most core and shell projects, the lighting is minimal - waiting for the TI to design the lighting.  If that is the case with a specific C&S project, then I assume the lighting is not fully designed then I assume that table 11.3.1 1(c) applies:
(c) When the energy cost budget method is applied to buildings in which
energy-related features have not yet been designed (e.g., a lighting system),
those yet-to-be-designed features shall be described in the proposed design so
that they minimally comply with applicable mandatory and prescriptive
requirements from Sections 5 through 10. Where the space classification for a
building is not known, the building shall be categorized as an office building.

In this case, then it would seem that there is no advantage to trying to design an efficient Core and Shell lighting design?  Any thoughts greatly appreciated.

Dr Farraj Al-Ajmi pretty much did this for his PhD studies at 
Loughborough University (UK). It's described in

Al-Ajmi, F., D.L.Loveday and V.I.Hanby 2006 ``The cooling potential of 
earth-air heat exchangers for domestic buildings in a desert climate'' 
Building and Environment 41:235--244.

and

Hanby, V.I., F.Al-Ajmi and D.L.Loveday 2004 ``The optimal design for a 
ground cooling tube in a hot, arid climate''  Building Services 
Engineering Research and Technology 26(1):1--10.

Farraj wrote TYPES for the ground cooling tube and the subsoil 
environment. I've lost touch with him but I think he has posted here in 
the past. He might be able to help you with some code. I modeled the ac 
unit sing a fixed temperature approach for each coil (evaporator and 
condenser) then assumed a fixed fraction of Carnot to get the energy 
consumption.

Ecotech is another very good tool to get mean radiant
temperatures in a space. You could report out zone
temperatures for an hour from an hourly report in
eQUEST and using those values into ecotech.
Hope this helps too.

And to further the discussion about MRT and PMV assessments....

If you do think this is important you might consider ESP-r which
allows you to calculate explicit viewfactors within the zone (for any
arbitrary shaped room, with or without surfaces acting as furniture
and the like ) as well as viewfactors between one or more 'rectangular
sensing bodies' in the zone and the surrounding surfaces.

Then you can investigate radiant asymetry as
well as the usual PMV PPD stats/graphs/frequency bins.  It will
tell you not only the surface temperatures but the temperatures within
the walls and an energy balance on the zone and at the faces of
each surface (including the long wave radiant exchange at the surfaces.

Some limitations... if you are also simulating bulk air flows there is
no agent to convert the flow rates into approximations of velocity
in the room and the clothing and metabolic rate
do not change dynamically - you supply these at results recovery
time (but then you could pose the question how many times
would PMV be over 1.5 if I adjusted the clo value to represent
taking off a jacket).  We never got around to making a sensor/thermostat
that minics PMV but you can control on resultant temperature or
some other ratio of air/MRT or even the temperature of a surface
in the room.

Really really sad folk could impose a CFD domain and then
track the plumes of heat given off by the people in the room
and see what happens when the window opens and the wind
picks up outside and look at the mean age of air as it changes
throughout the day (not recommended to do 3D adaptive transient
coupled CFD for hundreds of timesteps because your coffee gets cold
and in extreme cases friends give up on you).

Vikram,
 
For this exercise we are only concerned with lumped (room average) PMV -
therefore the MRT can simply be the area weighted average of all room
surface temps (and zones are small enough that we aren't worried about
drastic variations like you mention). It is for documentation of
acceptable thermal conditions for the Australian Greenstar rating
system. I agree that for design, especially at the facade, a discrete
solution is best.
 
Peter

Peter,
If your doing PMV calcs, I'm not sure any of the current energy
simulation models (energyplus, equest, trace etc) are a good choice.
They are lumped node models, and as such average zone temperatures and
surface temperatures. Things like MRT depend so much on what position in
the room your in. For instance in a 100 ft x 100ft room if you have a
west glass facade, with interior walls around it, your PMV 5 feet away
from the facade is going to be radically different than that 90 feet
away. I would also caution about averaging these values. If you have one
end of your room that's too cold, and another that's too hot, your
answer will be that every one is comfortable, when in reality no one is.

 
If your going to be basing a lot of design decisions on this study, I
would recommend using a full field solution (like CFD or RadTherm) that
will allow you to look at sample MRTs at different points in the room.

The version of the Library and Report manual I have does not allow 
reporting of inside surface temperatures.  You may have to switch to 
DOE2.1e from LBL.  It does allow reporting of inside surface temperature 
reporting.  See http://gundog.lbl.gov/dirsoft/21e_update2.pdf

I use UltraEdit.  http://www.ultraedit.com/ This text editor is fully 
customizable, you can set the line length to any amount to avoid word 
wrapping.  It has a macro recording facility which is very good for 
extracting specific information such as the SV-A system and zone listings, 
hourly channels, etc.  It reads and searches huge sim files instantly.  It 
has a great file compare function if you need to compare two input files to 
see what might be different.

*******************************

 If you're using the eQUEST parametric runs function, eQUEST generates the
following spreadsheet file which I've found to be particularly useful:

[FileName] - Parms.csv

This file lists the parametric run case description, the peak cooling coil
load, energy by end use, demand by end use, and total cost by energy type,
all in spreadsheet format.  If you've run the parametric run multiple
times, this spreadsheet also lists results from earlier runs.

 If you're using the eQUEST parametric runs function, eQUEST generates the
following spreadsheet file which I've found to be particularly useful:

[FileName] - Parms.csv

This file lists the parametric run case description, the peak cooling coil
load, energy by end use, demand by end use, and total cost by energy type,
all in spreadsheet format.  If you've run the parametric run multiple
times, this spreadsheet also lists results from earlier runs.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Ground loop heat pumps + boilers.
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200610250954.AA5451828pd80001311368@gard.com>

I understand that DOE2 (and therefore eQuest) doesn't handle boilers
connected to ground loop heat pumps.  This is of course a problem, as
unless you have a very large ground loop in reality you need an
additional heat source.  How I've decided to handle this is to use two
runs - one with a regular sized ground loop, and one with a ground loop
with 100x the area.  I then take the heat energy difference, and use
that as my predicted boiler energy use (after adjusting for efficiency).
Basically, I'm assuming a boiler steps in to provide the capacity that
the heat pumps could use when they need it.  

 

Does anyone see a problem with this strategy?  I understand it misses
some of the finer details of a ground source system, but it seems like a
reasonable estimate of energy use.  Is there a better way to do this?

 

 Thanks,

-Matt Gangemi, P.E.

Aditya,

http://www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/cfm/weather_data3.cfm/region=6_europe_wmo_region_6/country=FIN/cname=Finland

You can download an energy plus format weather file for helsikni which can
be analysed using a program called climate cosultant  (you might want
version 3 from http://www2.aud.ucla.edu/energy-design-tools/)

I believe there is a tool on the doe2.com website that converts an
energyplus weather file into a bin file that eQuest can use.

Good luck,
Ramana.

Andrew,
 
The issue is monospaced vs. proportionally spaced fonts.  The issue has
nothing to do with antiquated software, it is simply much easier to
design data reports with monospaced fonts than proportionally spaced
fonts.  As a previous poster suggested, 'Courier New' is a monospaced
font.  
 
Another one you might try is called 'Lucida Console'.

I was wondering if anyone had any hints or suggestions for an easier way
to import the simulation file reports from eQUEST into modern word
processing or spreadsheet software.  Right now when I try to copy and
paste a report from a standard text editor the spacing gets really
screwed up.   I know that the type set or format for the reports is
antiquated (dot matrix?) and is the reason for some of the problems, but
I don't know how to fix it.  Is there a more advanced text editor or
software that can help with this problem or is it a computer code issue?
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

the entire document, change the font to "Courier New", set font size to
7, and set left and right page margins to 0.25". That should do the

Two tid-bits (I'm in eQuest mode myself today...)

If you are looking just for the monthly energy end-uses, there will be a
file <filename>_EG_MoEU_ED.csv - I think this is the one John is talking
about.  It's great for importing since the fields are always in the same
location.

Also, if you open your eQuest.ini file in notepad (making a backup copy
beforehand of course...) and insert the lines:

;EDIT BELOW FOR Plant parameter output
StoreResults_HVAC_Summary=1

Then eQuest will produce another CSV file that includes listings of all
your equipment, systems, loops, etc.  This one is hard to work with on
an automated basis sometimes as your alternative runs may not have the
same number of pumps/loops/etc, changing the relative position of the
data.

I've inserted these two lines at the end of the "[preferences]" section.

Andrew, if these don't help you and you still need to import the sim
output, copy the page from the output viewer, paste into excel, and then
use "Text to columns" command with fixed widths or space delimiters.
Not automated, but Excel seems to understand at least once you've made
it into columns and will automatically parse into cells the next time
you paste the same data in the same location.

There is another program out there that can import data based on
keywords but I haven't advanced to that stage yet.  It's called AWK, you
can search the bldg-sim archive for information.  Might be worth it if
you are going to do this hundreds of times instead of tens of times.

Hi Andrew:
 
I am going to frighten you a bit.
 
Unbeknownst to me until last week, eQuest actually automatically
generates a few Excel files with the basic Monthly BEPU information
(space cooling area lights, heat rejection, etc), for all end uses, both
on a consumption AND demand basis.
 
Look at the .SIM file and find the Excel files generated.
 
I have NEVER seen this documented nor heard them mentioned in any eQuest
class. But it IS possible I missed such information.

John,

You may want to look into exactly what eQuest definition of a chiller reset temperature schedule is ... from my experience as a chiller plant engineer, the reset schedule you describe sounds like the reset of chilled water supply temperature based on outside air temperature, a function commonly found in chiller control panel software.  For example then, at 95?F OAT the chilled water supply temperature would be say 45?F, and at 70?F OAT the chilled water supply temp would be something like 55?F.

What parameter has the "setpoint" of 80?F?  The indoor space temperature, I presume... but doublecheck to make sure it's not something you're not expecting, like perhaps the chilled water supply.  If that checks out, than I would check to see if the low end of the reset schedule is holding the chillers on longer than expected, as would be indicated by a significant difference in chiller run hours between the 70?F stop and the 50?F reset schedule endpoint.


Hope that helps...

Has anyone had this problem?

I have two 215 ton VFD centrifugal chillers running in an office building in Salt Lake City (in eQuest, that is). I have the setpoint temp set to 80?F, the setpoint control to Load-Rest, the Max Rest Temp to 95?F, and the Min rest temp to 70?F. The latter is required for an ASHRAE-90.1-2001 Base Case model.

I reset the Min reset temp to 50?F, per manufacturer's telling me I could do so, to take advantage of colder .

To my utter amazement, the heat rejection kWh went up 10 TIMES !! Same chiller, same everything else (as far as I know).

Am I doing this correctly? What is happening?

The only difference I know of is that the program accounts for sun
angles in different locale. That would change your heating and cooling
load no doubt.

Hey everyone, 
My question is regarding the way in which eQuest uses weather data. I've
noticed that the bin files are taken from the doe2 site, and for many
smaller locations they use a near by site's bin calcs. However, when
comparing those two locations (in my case Lewiston & Grangeville,
Idaho), they come up with different heating loads. Is there a local
adjustment factors built into the way eQuest uses local weather data?
Thanks for the help.

Brian was first talking about the "simplified" refrigeration model
capability in the standard version of eQUEST (or DOE-2) This
should only be used when the refrigeration system details are not known
and represent a small fraction of the total building electrical use.

The refrigeration version of eQUEST should be used for modeling where the
refrigeration system energy use is a major building load - this includes both
refrigerated display cases or refrigerated spaces such as coolers and/or freezers
in any building - commonly grocery or bigbox stores and refrigerated warehouses.

Additionally, the refrigeration version of eQUEST (or DOE-2) should be used
when modeling built-up DX air-handler systems (single duct only at this time) in
most building types (using single/multiple configurations of recip, screw or
frictionless centrifugal compressors) Use of this version is required since
you need to describe the compressors, condenser, controls, and refrigerant piping to
the air handlers and the simulation must correctly handle a refrigerant coil in an
airhandler.  The standard version of DOE-2 does not allow the accurate modeling
of these type of built-up DX systems, only packaged DX models are available in
the standard version.

Note that the eQUEST 3.61, pre-release posted to the http://doe2.com/eQUEST last
week, installs both the standard and refrigeration versions of eQUEST including online
help for both versions of DOE-2 ... however, the refrigeration version does not include
and building creation or EEM wizards. Ther is also an older 3.55 standard+refrigeration
version posted (the "DEER" version from late 2005)

If someone is not "able to get the Refrigeration addin to work in eQuest" they might consider
reading the documentation, examining the examples, and (as a last resort) sending us email
with a description of the problem being encountered.  The refrigeration version of eQUEST
and DOE-2 has been successfully used on hundreds of real designs over the past six years by
dozens of analysts ... this includes dozens of Costco type big box stores, Wal-Mart superstores,
large and small grocery stores (all major chains and dozens of independents), and small, large and
super-large (>1,000,000 sqft) refrigerated warehouses (coolers and freezers)  I know of at least
40 projects currently under way using this version for analysis of design options.

Someone should provide a link to the EPRI SST showing its availability, cost, frequency of update,
support, building type and refrigeration modeling capabilities, and the number and types of
projects undertaken (by analysts other than the developers.)  I would have thought that a posting
by CDH Energy Corp (one of the EPRI SST developers) would have been more informative on
its product rather than simply attempting to bad mouth a product they have seemingly never used.

This site directs me to a Version 1.00.0015 that was updated on 11/18/02.
Is this the most recent version?

 

I currently have the following version installed, but the Live Update

WINDOW program has comprehensive database of glasses, and in its newest
version 6.1, it also includes glasses that are partially or fully diffuse,
however, I am not sure if there are any stained glass entries.  

BTW. there is no SHGC or U-factor data for single layers.  Instead, there is
conductivity of glass, surface emissivities (e_f and e_b), Transmittance
(Tau), and front and back reflectance (Rho_f and Rho_b).  Tau, Rho_b, and
Rho_f are given for each wavelength band from and inclusive of UV to near IR
(NIR).  This data is obtained by measurements in a spectrophotometer with an
integrated sphere.  For diffusing layers, it is desirable if these data is
also given for each incidence angle in the form of a matrix of incidence and
outgoing directions (i.e., Bi-Directional Transmittance and Reflectance
Distribution Functions or BTDF and BRDF).  Bi-Directional measurements are
more complex because of the need to measure individual outgoing directions,
subject to individual incident directions.  With these basic data, WINDOW
program calculates U-factor and SHGC for a glazing system that may consist
of single or multiple layers.  So U-factor and SHGC is pertinent to glazing
system, as exposed to outdoor and indoor boundary conditions, not single
isolated layers.

I've never been able to get the Refrigeration addin to work in eQuest.  
Is there a secret?  I also thought it severely limited the HVAC systems 
as it completed changed the internal calcuation engine structure?

SST from EPRI is available for $250 now.

The standard version of eQUEST (3.55 or 3.6) has a refrigeration model
in it which may be sufficient for your purposes.  It does allow zone
heating from refrigerated cases.  I would recommend starting here for
a simple refrigeration system such as your convenience store.

The refrigeration version of eQUEST has considerable more detail on
the refrigeration system (with pressure & flow in refrigerant loops
and details on individual cases and other circuit components).  It
models both heating from the heat rejected from the refrigerated cases
and HVAC cooling from the refrigeration system.  Currently, the
refrigerated version "add in" is available for version 3.55.  The
refrigeration version for eQUEST 3.6 is reportedly "coming soon".

While the SSS tool is available from EPRI -- the software is quite
expensive.

The EPRI Supermarket Simulation Tool was designed to integrate 
refrigeration and HVAC. I think it's still available directly from
EPRI.

The EPRI Supermarket Simulation Tool was designed to integrate 
refrigeration and HVAC. I think it's still available directly from EPRI.

Hi all;

I am trying to integrate a walk-in cooler in a convenient store in store's  HVAC system. In winter, I would like to direct the heat from the walk-in cooler cooling system to be used in heating the store. The store is in Greenville, NC ( moderate climate). The convenient store is still in the design phase now. The estimated heating load for the convenient store is 48,000 Btu/hour. The walk-in cooler cooling capacity should be appproximatelly four tons. The convenient store design is an open plan with high ceiling. Does anyone have an idea of how such integration might be?

Thank you for your help.

Hello all,

I am a newbie in Building Modeling and eQuest.

Currently I am in the process of working in developing a baseline case.

Question:

1. This is about Table G3.1, No.5, which is Building Envelope part of the requirement for calculating proposed and baseline building performance on ASHRAE 90.1-2004. Can anyone explain about point "b" in Baseline Building performance column? My understanding is as follow: It looks like what ever the proposed building is, the base line building will always consist of: a) Insulation entirely above deck type of roofs, b) Steel-framed type of above-grade walls, and c) Steel-joist type of floors. Can anyone please confirm if my understanding is correct or wrong?

 

2. This is about how to translate the requirement of Opaque elements from Table 5.5-1 to 5.5-8 of ASHRAE 90.1-2004 to Equest (Design Development Wizard: Shell component, windows 3 and 4). How do we use the value from the table 5.5 on Equest exactly? I am a little bit unclear about where I should plug in these values from this table on eQuest.

For example:

If we see Wizard screen 3 of 25, say Roof Surfaces part.

My understanding is: 

Construction and Ext Finish/Color part, this data we get from the architecture drawing.

On the other hand, does the value from the table 5.5 go straight to Exterior Insulation and Add'l Insulation part?

 

 

Any answer you could provide is greatly appreciated.

 

Sincerely,

 

Virdi Permana

Jon,

No, it is just the opposite. Cool roofs make most difference with  attic
deck insulation and unvented attics.

The delta T across the insulation is much increased with an unvented
attic (185 vs. 85 to interior of attic= 100 F delta T) With a vented
attic (140 attic to 75 F interior) = 65 degree delta T.

So cool roofs actually will have greatest impact when the battle is all
to be fought right under the roof.

Duct heat transfer is important, but is affected by sizing and a host of
factors (getting the attic heat balance correct).

Simulating heat transfer in attics is complex. Our residential
simulation, EnergyGauge USA does a good job. Here is more than you want
to know, but that's what it takes to get it right.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Cool Roof simulation

We have looked into low absorptance, high emissivity roof coatings on
several occassions.  Your results aren't too far off those we have come
up with using EQuest and Apache.

Judging by the mesaured data available from SkyCool, it seems there is a
property / physical mechanism that is not represented by conventional
absoprtance and emissivity.  There is speculation that the coatings have
an extended surface area from which they emit.  This extended area could
be a result of surface roughness or the material emitting from multiple
layers within the coating ... If this is in fact what is happening, the
sums will show a greater benefit though no program to my knowledge would
allow you to account for this.  In simple terms it would be represented
as an emissivity of greater than 1 across the projectd area of the roof
...

Anyone else getting similar advice from other coating suppliers?

Graham

Hello All:

I am looking for a fairly straight forward to model a "Cool Roof" in
eQuest.

My general understanding would be to do a Parametric Run, changing the
outside emissivity from, say 0.75 to 0.3. But I am getting VERY little
energy benefit.

My building is a 140,000 sf office, 2-story (70,000 sf roof). It has a
CW VAV system with HW reheat, and return air is through ceiling plenums.

I am only seeing about a 50,000 kWh saving out of 11,000,000 kWh HVAC
usage.

Any experience, suggestions?

Hello All,

 

I am attempting too learn how too use the parametric runs in DOE2
eQuest.  There are some things the tutorial helps with put not
everything.  I need help with 

 

1.	ECM Lights - upgrade from T-12 to T-8 with more efficient
ballast (I have used the power Definition for the base case)
2.	HVAC - upgrade from a DX cooling system too either an evap
cooling or a higher EER cooling system
3.	Night Set Back - for both Heating and Cooling

 

Any help will be greatly appreciated.  As well if anyone knows about an
online eQuest class I can take that would be great as well.  

 

Thanks so much for everyone's help in the past and now.

I'm not that familiar with it but it might provide you with a quick
estimate of what you should expect.

John - That savings may not be so far out of line. Check the outside air
and
insulation assumptions. You could possibly be exhausting a lot of that
load
(plenum heat gain) if you are running with a high OA percentage. Also, I
don't know where your building is, but based on the data provided your
HVAC
EUI is 78 kWh/SqFt-Yr, a very high value. The savings are around 0.35
kWh/SqFt-Yr, not totally unreasonable depending on your chiller plant
efficiency. Our experience with cool roofs has been limited to buildings
where the roof is directly coupled to the conditioned space.

Hello All:

I am looking for a fairly straight forward to model a "Cool Roof" in
eQuest.

My general understanding would be to do a Parametric Run, changing the
outside emissivity from, say 0.75 to 0.3. But I am getting VERY little
energy benefit.

My building is a 140,000 sf office, 2-story (70,000 sf roof). It has a
CW VAV system with HW reheat, and return air is through ceiling plenums.

I am only seeing about a 50,000 kWh saving out of 11,000,000 kWh HVAC
usage.

Any experience, suggestions?

John,
Did you try changing the absorptance? Actually desired emissivity in
roofs works kind of reverse to windows. A cool roof should have high
emissivity numbers (allowing it to radiate heat and not convert that
heat to a temperature rise). A common misconception is that energy star
roofs are Low-E. Low-E roofs should actually heat up more than a high-E
roof.

Try changing the absorptance numbers and see if that affects your
simulation.

EnergyPlus Version 1.4.0 Now Available

The thirteenth major version of EnergyPlus (1.4.0) was released on October
12, 2006 and is now available in versions for both the Windows and Linux
operating systems.  Download at no cost from the EnergyPlus web site:
www.energyplus.gov.


What's New in Version 1.4.0?

A few of the new features in EnergyPlus V 1.4 are listed below--see
www.energyplus.gov/features.html for a complete list of new features added
in this and previous versions:

* NEW water manager to control and report water use throughout the building
including HVAC components, zone-level water end-use objects that allow hot
and cold water mixing at the tap, zone latent gains, drainwater heat
recovery, rainwater collectors for harvesting precipitation, groundwater
wells with pumping, water storage tanks for storing and reusing reclaimed
water.

* New Zone thermostatic control options including operative temperature and
thermal comfort control using Fanger PMV values as setpoints.

* New simple duct leakage model for VAV system with return plenum

* New reformulated version of the DOE 2.1E EIR chiller based on the PG&E
Cool Tools project.

* Window and door multipliers and triangular doors are now allowed.

* Exterior window screens can now be modeled more accurately.

* New predefined reports to aid in complying with beyond-code programs such
as the new commercial building tax deduction including input verification
and results, climate, envelope and equipment summaries.

And many other enhancements and significant speed improvements throughout.


Update on User Interfaces?

EP-Quick creates an EnergyPlus input file based on a broad range of zone
templates (released in April 2005).  E2AC is an interface in Portuguese and
English (available since January 2005).  DesignBuilder, a graphic user
interface, was released in December 2005.  Hevacomp uses EnergyPlus as its
simulation engine (2006). EFEN is now available in beta version for users
to test.  Green Building Studio can take an existing CAD file and convert
to an EnergyPlus input file. Several other interfaces are under
development.  Watch our web site (www.energyplus.gov/ep_interfaces.html)
for up-to-date information on these and other interfaces.

A number of utilities and tools for creating, editing, and running input
files come with EnergyPlus, including IDF Editor, EP-Launch, and
HVAC-Diagram (see www.energyplus.gov/ep_utilities.html). Third party tools
for creating, editing, and displaying EnergyPlus input files are also
available, including DrawBDL, EcoTect,  ESP-r, Green Building Studio,
EzDrawPlus, IFCtoIDF, TSe+, and EzPlus-Parm.  See
www.energyplus.gov/third_party_tools.html for more information.

Jessie,
 
In the absence of better information, you might consider using a US city
at similar latitude (e.g. Sasebo is 33.10N, while Atlanta GA is 33.65N
and Irvine CA is 33.67N) with similar design day conditions. Draw a
latitude line from Atlanta GA to Irvine CA and find a city with
reasonably close design db & wb's, ideally with similar cooling and
heating degree days. 
 
FWIW...

Holly:
 
Solar PV is for electric generation only. Unfortunately, there IS NO
solar thermal (DHW or otherwise) currently in eQUEST. My understanding
of the best and quickest way to develop this energy savings is to use
the RET Screen software, developed in Canada, I believe. The software is
free.
 
Do the rest of your analysis in eQUEST, then do a separate calculation
in one of the RETScreen programs for you solar DHW savings. It appears
quite comprehensive and is easy to use.

Hello All,

I am adding solar thermal too my model.  The solar thermal is for the
DWH load in the building.  I set up the Solar PV but am not sure how too
hook the DWH load to it.  The DWH is still being supplied by natural
gas.  Any help is greatly appreciated. 

 

Thanks,

Holly

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200610061916.AA1644718pd80001279787@gard.com>

I am using eQuest, and am modeling a building with a ground source heat pump (open loop) and heat recovery chiller.  In eQuest, I have a ground-water circulation loop (open lake/well type), and am using a Loop-to-Loop heat pump chiller.  I am looking at two scenarios:  a constant condenser water temperature (well water at 55?F all year), and a varying condenser water temperature (well water winter temp low at 51?F, and summer temp high at 63?F, and a curve fit varying the water in between). I already have schedules set up to simulate the condenser water temperature scenarios this, but am running into problems in determining how the chiller performance curves are working...
 
Does anyone out there have an understanding of the relationship of the various doe2 default EIR and performance curves for this loop-to-loop heat pump chiller type (operating in both cooling and heating mode)....  I'm not finding a lot of direction in the doe.2 dictionary.  I would like to ask a chiller manufacturer to provide part-load curves and EIRs at different condenser water temperatures, but cannot tell how these values are translated into the three performance curves indicated for this chiller.
 
I have generated performance curves in the past for condensing boilers, and part load curves for centrifugal chillers, so I already understand the general principle of normalizing the data.  
 
Any help you could offer would be much appreciated.
 
Thank you,
Kate

Ask jeff.hirsch at doe2.com for a precise status. I DO know it has been
formally submitted as promised in August. My guess is that will be
"blessed' by the end of the year.  Keep an eye on the CEC Meeting
docket. That is where you will see the action on eQUEST happen. Nothing
as of this week's meetings.
 
Hope springs eternal.

MessageAs I've stated in a previous message, DOE-2.1E in its various guises has been used extensively in China.  I've recently completed an ASHRAE paper that compared DOE-2 to measured data for the first LEED Gold building in China - the US-China Agenda 21 demonstration energy-efficient office building that was a collaboration between USDOE and China Ministry of Science and Technology. But validation of DOE-2, or any simulation program, against measured data is almost entirely a matter of matching results by adjusting the inputs. Only very detailed measurements would be able to discern possible discrepancies in heat flows or predicted indoor temperatures or loads.  Leaving aside the issues of inputs and weather data, I cannot think of any intrinsic thermodynamic reason why DOE-2 (or any other physically-based thermal simulation program) would be inappropriate for China.

  Matt,

  If you are looking for validation of DOE-2.1E, you can find reports at gundog.lbl.gov web pages.

  I have not seen any measurement verification reports done in China for DOE-2 simulations.

      My mistake!  You are correct that the epw-->csv conversion will only give DB, 
      RH, and Dew Point.  The alternate route is to run an annual simulation with
      EnergyPlus using the weather file of interest, select "Outdoor Wet Bulb" as an
      hourly REPORT VARIABLE, and then use the csv output file to generate 
      statistics.  One could even generate the averages with EnergyPlus by applying
      schedules to the report variable and reporting the scheduled value as monthly
      averages.

I have used the eQUEST PV simulation, and compared it to a RETScreen model. There seems to be very good agreement between the 2. That being said, I happened to do the correlation on only one model - I would be curious if anyone else has had similar results. I was pretty satisfied with the eQUEST simulation. The only area that I had some difficulty with was setting up a sales meter to export to the grid.

Hi Matt:
 
eQUEST has a PV simulation built in, but I have not yet had a chance to run it. It can apply (as far as I know) to any type of building you can model within the program. It would be the same as putting a generator on the building.
 
You would need to ask marlin.addison at doe2.com <mailto:marlin.addison at doe2.com>  or jeff.hirsch at doe2.com, for any validation results. eQUEST uses an new DOE-2 version, dubbed DOE-2.2, which changes and adds some features to the old DOE-2.
 
I have been using eQUEST on nearly 100 buildings, and I have had good matching with utility bills in several parts of the United States. So what type of validation are you seeking? This is not a "new" program, and it's creators are original DOE-2 developers.

	My mistake!  You are correct that the epw-->csv conversion will only give DB, 
	RH, and Dew Point.  The alternate route is to run an annual simulation with
	EnergyPlus using the weather file of interest, select "Outdoor Wet Bulb" as an
	hourly REPORT VARIABLE, and then use the csv output file to generate

Hi Matt:
 
eQUEST has a PV simulation built in, but I have not yet had a chance to run it. It can apply (as far as I know) to any type of building you can model within the program. It would be the same as putting a generator on the building.
 
You would need to ask marlin.addison at doe2.com <mailto:marlin.addison at doe2.com>  or jeff.hirsch at doe2.com, for any validation results. eQUEST uses an new DOE-2 version, dubbed DOE-2.2, which changes and adds some features to the old DOE-2.
 
I have been using eQUEST on nearly 100 buildings, and I have had good matching with utility bills in several parts of the United States. So what type of validation are you seeking? This is not a "new" program, and it's creators are original DOE-2 developers.

Matt,
 
If you are looking for validation of DOE-2.1E, you can find reports at
gundog.lbl.gov web pages.
 
I have not seen any measurement verification reports done in China for DOE-2
simulations.

My mistake!  You are correct that the epw-->csv conversion will only give
DB, 
RH, and Dew Point.  The alternate route is to run an annual simulation with
EnergyPlus using the weather file of interest, select "Outdoor Wet Bulb" as
an
hourly REPORT VARIABLE, and then use the csv output file to generate 
statistics.  One could even generate the averages with EnergyPlus by
applying
schedules to the report variable and reporting the scheduled value as
monthly
averages.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] eQust and DoE simulation in China
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200610050736.AA3659906pd80001276466@gard.com>

Dear all,

My question is about eQuest. I wander if eQuest could be used to to energy
simulation for a highrise residential building with PV system? Are there any
published paper on this?

my second question is about the validation of the program. Has anybody used
eQuest in semin tropical climate in China (or similar area like hongkong)
and validated their result? Jeff suggested that eQuest shares the same core
as DOE-2 which has been extensively used in China and I can get validation
from the  DoE. Any suggestion is highly appreciated.

Your help is very much appreciated.

Best Regards,

Matt

There are now several centers of expertise in building energy simulations in 
China.  The latest revisions of the building energy standards are all based 
on DOE-2, with plans to eventually convert to EnergyPlus.  The Building 
Physics Institute of the China Academy of Building Research has taken the 
lead in doing these simulations, although at least 4-5 other provincial 
academies of building research in Guangdong, Fujian, Heilongjiang, are also 
using DOE-2 on a regular basis.  These all use a user interface developed by 
the Building Physics Institute in 2002-2004, although the Building Physics 
Institute itself can be considered an "expert" user capable of making code 
changes in DOE-2 itself.   The software arm of CABR has also added DOE-2 for 
code compliance to their commercial PKPM architectural design software that 
is widely marketed in China.  There is also another architectural software 
company that's also developed a DOE-2-based program for code compliance 
calculations.  In the universities, there are some users of VisualDOE, and 
quite a number of graduate students who have downloaded and using 
EnergyPlus. DeST is an independent simulation program  developed by Tsinghua 
University that has a graphical user interface using an AutoCAD add-on for 
the building geometry.  DeST is being used in a number of universities, but 
less so by engineers and design firms.  Recently, the Pacific Energy Center 
in Shanghai has migrated from VisualDOE to ESP, primarily because the 
director is a former member of the ESP development team in the UK.  Lastly, 
there are also a few TRNSYS users in China.

 I recently attended a building energy conservation conference in Hangzhou, 
where a third of the papers presented results based on computer simulations. 
My main observations are that (1)  capabilities and acceptance of computer 
simulations have developed very fast in the last several years,  and (2) 
building design in China is highly computerized, which translates to 
architects and engineers who are very comfortable in using computers; this 
should be factored in promoting or offering building energy simulations.

Building energy simulation is picking up in China although most is done
by universities. 

DOE-2 and DeST are two popular tools used in China.
Details of DeST is available at www.dest.com.cn.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] HR6203
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200610031231.AA3102312pd80001273303@gard.com>

The USA subscribers might be interested in a bill passed by 
voice vote in the House last week. HR 6203 would provides a 
"ENERGY EFFICIENT BUILDING GRANT PROGRAM" which can include 
"Grants ... for up to 50 percent of design and energy 
modeling costs, not to exceed $50,000 per building."  The 
text of the bill is below. It still needs to get approved 
by the Senate and the President and I have no idea if that 
is likely or unlikely.

Jason

-------------------------------------


SEC. 10. ENERGY EFFICIENT BUILDING GRANT PROGRAM.

      (a) Energy Efficient Building Pilot Grant Program-

            (1) IN GENERAL- Not later than 6 months after 
the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall 
establish a pilot program to award grants to businesses and 
organizations for new construction of energy efficient 
buildings, or major renovations of buildings that will 
result in energy efficient buildings, to demonstrate 
innovative energy efficiency technologies, especially those 
sponsored by the Department.

            (2) AWARDS- The Secretary shall award grants 
under this subsection competitively to those applicants 
whose proposals--

                  (A) best demonstrate--

                        (i) likelihood to meet or exceed 
the standards referred to in subsection (b)(2);

                        (ii) likelihood to maximize cost-
effective energy efficiency opportunities; and

                        (iii) advanced energy efficiency 
technologies; and

                  (B) maximize the leverage of private 
investment for costs related to increasing the energy 
efficiency of the building.

            (3) CONSIDERATION- The Secretary shall give due 
consideration to proposals for buildings that are likely to 
serve low and moderate income populations.

            (4) AMOUNT OF GRANTS- Grants under this 
subsection shall be for up to 50 percent of design and 
energy modeling costs, not to exceed $50,000 per building. 
No single grantee may be eligible for more than 3 grants 
per year under this program.

            (5) GRANT PAYMENTS-

                  (A) INITIAL PAYMENT- The Secretary shall 
pay 50 percent of the total amount of the grant to grant 
recipients upon selection.

                  (B) REMAINDER OF PAYMENT- The Secretary 
shall pay the remaining 50 percent of the grant only after 
independent certification, by a professional engineer or 
other qualified professional, that operational buildings 
are energy efficient buildings as defined in subsection 
(b).

                  (C) FAILURE TO COMPLY- The Secretary 
shall not provide the remainder of the payment unless the 
building is certified within 6 months after operation of 
the completed building to meet the requirements described 
in subparagraph (B), or in the case of major renovations 
the building is certified within 6 months of the completion 
of the renovations.

            (6) REPORT TO CONGRESS- Not later than 3 years 
after awarding the first grant under this subsection, the 
Secretary shall transmit to Congress a report containing--

                  (A) the total number and dollar amount of 
grants awarded under this subsection; and

                  (B) an estimate of aggregate cost and 
energy savings enabled by the pilot program under this 
subsection.

            (7) ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES- Administrative 
expenses for the program under this subsection shall not 
exceed 10 percent of appropriated funds.

      (b) Definition of Energy Efficient Building- For 
purposes of this section the term `energy efficient 
building' means a building that--

            (1) achieves a reduction in energy consumption 
of--

                  (A) at least 30 percent for new 
construction, compared to the energy standards set by the 
2004 International Energy Conservation Code (in the case of 
residential buildings) or ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004; or

                  (B) at least 20 percent for major 
renovations, compared to energy consumption before 
renovations are begun;

            (2) is constructed or renovated in accordance 
with the most current, appropriate, and applicable 
voluntary consensus standards, as determined by the 
Secretary, such as those listed in the assessment under 
section 914(b), or revised or developed under section 
914(c), of the Energy Policy Act of 2005; and

            (3) after construction or renovation--

                  (A) uses heating, ventilating, and air 
conditioning systems that perform at no less than Energy 
Star standards; or

                  (B) if Energy Star standards are not 
applicable, uses Federal Energy Management Program 
recommended heating, ventilating, and air conditioning 
products.

      (c) Authorization of Appropriations- There are 
authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary for carrying 
out this section--

            (1) $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2008; and

            (2) such sums as may be necessary for each of 
the fiscal years 2009 through 2011.

Dear bldg-sim users,

I would like to know if somebody has heard about the use of thermal building 
simulation in China (exept in education and research).
My purpose is to evaluate the number of company able to offer services of 
thermal building simulation for the construction of an important building in 
China, and also to know which are the most used softwares.

Thanks for your reply,
