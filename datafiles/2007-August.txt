	Hello again,
	 
	I recieved some great information from Sam Mason who is an
environmental designer at Atelier Ten Consulting Environmental Designers
in New York. He researched the City Multi for his Masters. Thank you Sam
for your help! 
	 
	Here it is:
	 
	Dana,

	The City Multi was the topic of my master's project and I ran
into several 
	problems trying to the model the system. My conclusion was that
	using eQUEST, it is not possible to model the system for a few
reasons.
	There is also a lack of information from Mitsubishi that makes
modeling
	tough.
	 
	First, with regards to each indoor unit, setting a constant EIR
(like
	you mentioned doing) does not allow for the variation in
performance due
	to temperature changes in the space and outdoors. If you look in
the
	engineering manual, there are power and capacity relations for
each unit
	at various temperatures. These corrections need to be
incorporated for
	each indoor unit and this may be possible using ms-dos batch
files.
	 
	Second, there is no way to account for the free-energy BC
controller
	operation in terms of refrigerant transferred to/from zones and
the
	effectiveness at which the refrigerant used. Even though the
coil loads
	would be known for each zone from DOE2, the state and
temperature of the
	refrigerant would be needed to figure out how much energy is
available
	fro space conditioning in other zones.
	 
	Third, DOE2 is steady-state modeling software, but this system
is hugely
	dynamic. From my monitoring of the system, I found that the
compressor
	cycles at various frequencies over the course of one minute,
thus
	changing the capacity of the system hundreds of times an hour.
Energy
	Plus might be a better tool because it can run at 15 minute
intervals.
	Fourth, Mitsubishi does not supply the part load curves for the
	compressor operation. This means there is no way to accurately
model
	the unloading and part load performance of the compressor. In
addition,
	it is an inverter driven and not a hard start compressor, so the
part
	load performance should be quite good.
	 
	These systems are going to become
	more popular and already are in certain areas. I have found one
paper
	referring to a module for energy plus that models these types of
	systems, but I cannot get a hold of the author. I also know that
energy
	soft has been working on developing a module for their software,
but I
	do not know the status.

System
		
		
		Hello all,
		 
		We have recently performed an analysis on a building
that is potentially going to incorporate the City Multi system. After
many hours of going through eQUEST, I devised a method of modeling it
that I would like to run past you all for any thoughts/ideas. 
		 
		First, for those not aware of the problems, here is a
background of the systems:
		 
		The City Multi system consists of essentially three
parts: the condenser, the BC controller, and the heat exchanger unit at
each zone. Refrigerant is the only property used for heat exchange, i.e.
there is no water running from the condenser to the controller to the
zone units. Each zone unit is essentially a fan coil, in that there is
no compressor work at the zone, only fan energy. The BC controller is
essentially a heat exchanger which gives the City Multi system a large
advantage by being able to transfer heat, say from the south face of a
building, to the north face, which is in the shade. All of the
individual zone units connect to the BC controller and the BC controller
distributes the refrigerant accordingly. If there is not enough free
energy being generated by the system, the compressor kicks in and
supplies or rejects heat from the loop to meet the demand. 
		 
		To model this in eQUEST, which has been suggested
before, the water source heat pump system should be selected in order to
account for the free transfer of heat from zone to zone. There are,
however, several problems with this. One is that pumping energy is
required to pump the water throughout the building. The second problem
is that at each zone, each heat pump runs a compression cycle in order
to supply or reject heat to or from the zone to the water loop. The
third is that a boiler and cooling tower take the place for the
condenser in the City Multi system. Each system requires a make-up air
unit which can be modeled the same in each simulation.
		 
		Now here is what I would like you all to review: 
		 
		These are some of the steps I went to in order to make
the water source heat pump as much like the City Multi as possible.

		*	Made the boiler and electric boiler (to simulate
the electric compressor) and gave it the appropriate heating EIR that
was specified in the Citi Multi specification manual. I gave the fan the
same EIR as the cooling side of the compressor in the same manual. 
		*	I made a spreadsheet to subtract out the pumping
energy (only from the water loop! Not the DHW loop!) to simulate the
suction of the refrigerant through the building in the City Multi
system. I had to do this in the BEPS and the BEPU report which made it
kind of a hassle to find the energy cost savings. 
		*	For each heat pump, I set the EIR equal to
0.0001 to simulate the fan coil in the City Multi system. Therefore,
whatever heat is transferred to or from the water loop is only shown
with the fan energy from blowing the air over the coils. IF this is not
a proper way to do it, then what should the EIR be? It cannot be the EIR
from the condenser, because that has nothing to do with the free heat
transfer energy at the zones. 

		What do you guys think about this approach? I figure
that since this is a tough problem that other people have encountered as
well, I might as well use this huge resource that has many great minds
to come to a solution. 
		 
		Please, any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

		Dana Troy

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200708311301.AA0126656pd80001484311@gard.com>

Lan,
 
As JL suggests, if yours is a hot and humid climate, you may have better results using a heat wheel (enthalpy wheel) with total enthalpy recovery.  Sensible-only as shown in my example is economical in relatively low humidity, cool-summer climates that don't provide much summertime heat recovery opportunity.  
 
So for your project, calculate the theoretical summertime opportunity value before attempting troubleshooting with eQuest:

*	
	What are the estimated flow rates of the outdoor and exhaust airstreams?
*	
	What are the outdoor air expected summer average conditions in terms of temperature and humidity (i.e. enthalpy)?  
*	
	What is the expected temperature and humidity of the exhaust airstream? 

	*	
		The exhaust airstream in general occupancy applications can be estimated at about 85??F and 35% relative humidity, corresponding to the absolute moisture content at 55??F saturation temperature from a typical cooling coil, plus 2% for people and processes.  

*	
	Now the opportunity value of summertime heat recovery may be estimated:

	*	
		Calculate the enthalpy difference between the outdoor summer average and the estimated exhaust airstream, and multiply by the ratio of the exhaust/OSA flow rates. 

Without significant differential enthalpy between outdoor ambient average and the exhaust airstream, there simply may not be much summertime heat recovery opportunity.
 
Hope that helps...

Thank you very much, Brandon. After I tried used DT/DH control with rang from 5-30, I still didn't get any saving on the cooling side - the ERV sim report still show heating energy used during summer. Any more suggestion?

	I have problem simulating ERV in eQUSET. In the program I specified ERV effectiveness around 72%, the results show 64% energy saving in heating but just 5% saving in cooling, even when I cut off all the fan tempetrature increase. Anyone has experience or suggestion?. Thank you very much.

Therefore for summer season heat recovery, if the climate is hot and humid, total heat recovery with both moisture and sensible heat recovery can offer a better energy saving.

What is more complicated for simulation anaylsis, that total heat exchange effectiveness varies with air conditions on both sides, but a simplfied average effective can be used with reasonable accuracy.

Another option would be rockwool insulation, primarily made from slag.
The issue is higher embodied energy costs due to the fabrication

Have you considered cellulose insulation?  Damp-spray or
blown-in-blanket cellulose is a viable alternative to all of these
products.  

- impregnated with borate for excellent fire-resistance, mold and pest
control
- better than foam and batt insulation for sound management
- roughly R-3 per inch (about the same for fiberglass and low-density
spray foams)
- reduces infiltration significantly over batt insulation but not as
much as spray foam
- is roughly 1.5 times the cost of batt insulation (compared with 2
times the cost for LDF)
- installation defects are generally much easier to avoid than with batt
insulation
- generally good moisture management characteristics, though it has been
recommended to avoid applying directly to an exterior masonry assembly
- very low embodied energy - made from recycled newspapers

Green Fiber and National Fiber are two manufacturers that I am familiar
with in the northeast US.

I wanted to chime in here since I spent my first 17 years as a Western
Illinois farm boy.

I think using the remnants of the soybeans that have already been used
for food purposes is a very good idea.  Not that there aren't other uses
for that material, or that there are both better and worse products to
use for insulation.  Also what industries are near the food plant so
that you can process and use the recovered material without shipping it
cross-country.

I think what you were hinting at in the second part Len is ethanol, then
yes that is a very complex issue with more variables than just energy.

As an aside, soybeans actually are a legume crop that reintroduces some
nutrients to the soil while growing, compared to corn which only takes
from the environment and can be a much more intensive as far as the
inputs required to grow them.  Many farmers will utilize crop rotations
where soybeans and corn are planted in alternating years to reduce the
amount of fertilizers used during the corn year.  Increasing the demand
for soybeans will help that balance.  (Where ethanol will tip the
balance towards more corn.)

Anyway, there are a lot of issues there, but probably not directly
related to building simulation.

David

Lan, see this post...
 
http://elcca-exchange.blogspot.com/2007/04/equest-parametric-sensible-heat.html
 
Here's an excerpt:
 
$ FLOAT gives maximum heat recovery but recovers even unwanted heat, so
$ use this setting for temperature control
ERV-TEMP-CTRL = MIXED-AIR-RESET
 
Also, the ?T between exhaust and OSA is typically not great, even if its 110?F outside and your exhaust/relief is 85?F, the ?T is only 25?F -- compare that to even a mild winter condition of 35?F, where the ?T is double at equivalent exhaust temperature (i.e 85 - 35 = 50?F).

Hi, all,
 
I have problem simulating ERV in eQUSET. In the program I specified ERV effectiveness around 72%, the results show 64% energy saving in heating but just 5% saving in cooling, even when I cut off all the fan tempetrature increase. Anyone has experience or suggestion?. Thank you very much.

Another option would be rockwool insulation, primarily made from slag.
The issue is higher embodied energy costs due to the fabrication
process.

Have you considered cellulose insulation?  Damp-spray or
blown-in-blanket cellulose is a viable alternative to all of these
products.  

- impregnated with borate for excellent fire-resistance, mold and pest
control
- better than foam and batt insulation for sound management
- roughly R-3 per inch (about the same for fiberglass and low-density
spray foams)
- reduces infiltration significantly over batt insulation but not as
much as spray foam
- is roughly 1.5 times the cost of batt insulation (compared with 2
times the cost for LDF)
- installation defects are generally much easier to avoid than with batt
insulation
- generally good moisture management characteristics, though it has been
recommended to avoid applying directly to an exterior masonry assembly 
- very low embodied energy - made from recycled newspapers

Green Fiber and National Fiber are two manufacturers that I am familiar
with in the northeast US.

I wanted to chime in here since I spent my first 17 years as a Western
Illinois farm boy.

I think using the remnants of the soybeans that have already been used
for food purposes is a very good idea.  Not that there aren't other uses
for that material, or that there are both better and worse products to
use for insulation.  Also what industries are near the food plant so
that you can process and use the recovered material without shipping it
cross-country.

I think what you were hinting at in the second part Len is ethanol, then
yes that is a very complex issue with more variables than just energy.

As an aside, soybeans actually are a legume crop that reintroduces some
nutrients to the soil while growing, compared to corn which only takes
from the environment and can be a much more intensive as far as the
inputs required to grow them.  Many farmers will utilize crop rotations
where soybeans and corn are planted in alternating years to reduce the
amount of fertilizers used during the corn year.  Increasing the demand
for soybeans will help that balance.  (Where ethanol will tip the
balance towards more corn.)

Anyway, there are a lot of issues there, but probably not directly
related to building simulation.

David

Thanks to everyone's responses on this topic - I've prepared a list of
some available products (certainly not exhaustive) - hopefully this will
be helpful to some!


*************************************************
Summary of green insulation products:

1.	BioBased Insulation
a.	Soy based spray insulation foam
b.	R3.83 per inch
c.	High Fire Rating (Class 1)
d.	Approved by the ICC, IBC, IRC and UBC
e.	http://www.biobased.net/
2.	EMEGA Biopolymers, LLC
a.	Soy based spray insulation foam
b.	R3.6 per inch
c.	High Fire Rating (Class 1)
d.	Not sure about codes
e.	http://www.emegabiopolymers.com/
3.	Soyol
a.	Soy based foam and rigid insulation (2 different products)
b.	R3.7 per inch
c.	High Fire Rating (Class 1)
d.	Not sure about codes
e.	http://www.soyoyl.com/products/soytherm.asp
4.	Mineral fiber wool insulation made from recycled slag
a.	Mineral wool made from recycled slag (not rock!) contains an
average of 75% post-industrial recycled content. It doesn't require
additional chemicals to make it fire resistant
b.	R3.7 to R4.2 per inch
c.	Meets building and fire codes
d.	http://www.thermafiber.com/default.asp?PageIndex=574 (80%
recycled content)
5.	Cotton batt insulation is manufactured from post-industrial
denim and cotton fibers
a.	R3.4 per inch
b.	Meets building and fire codes
c.	http://www.idahoblue.com/

A few options from Europe....

6.	Sheep's wool insulation
a.	http://www.sheepwoolinsulation.ie/
7.	Isonat Insulation made from hem and recycled fibers
a.	http://www.naturalinsulations.co.uk/Isonat.htm
8.	Homatherm recycled cellulose insulation
a.
http://www.greenspec.co.uk/html/product-pages/HomathermflexCL040.php

Also, if you have to go with a standard foam insulation, there are 2 new
types of foam insulations that do not use CFCs or HCFCs:
1.	Icynene
a.	Icynene is a foaming agent that uses a mixture of carbon dioxide
<http://www.aerias.org/DesktopModules/ArticleDetail.aspx?articleId=138&s
paceid=2&subid=13>  and water. Though it does not have polyurethane's
HCFC-related environmental problems, it also has a lower insulation
rating (R-value). Like polyurethane, Icynene is foamed into wall
cavities, but the resultant open-cell foam is soft, not rigid. 
b.	http://www.icynene.com/
2.	Air Krete
a.	Air Krete(tm) is an inorganic foam produced from magnesium oxide
(derived from sea water). It is foamed under pressure with a microscopic
cell generator and compressed air; no CFCs or HCFCs are used. 
b.	http://www.airkrete.com/

Commercially farmed soy is genetically modified.  
Genetically modified organisms require heavy pesticide use to grow.  
Pesticides are specifically designed to kill everything except a single
crop.
The man-made tandems cause us cancer and disease.
Health care is skyrocketing to epic proportions.
Our tax dollars go to an illegal war.
According to the law, which is apparently admissible in court, paying taxes
is a choice.

Don't tell the owner this, but there might be a better choice out there.

I wanted to chime in here since I spent my first 17 years as a Western
Illinois farm boy.

I think using the remnants of the soybeans that have already been used
for food purposes is a very good idea.  Not that there aren't other uses
for that material, or that there are both better and worse products to
use for insulation.  Also what industries are near the food plant so
that you can process and use the recovered material without shipping it
cross-country.

I think what you were hinting at in the second part Len is ethanol, then
yes that is a very complex issue with more variables than just energy.

As an aside, soybeans actually are a legume crop that reintroduces some
nutrients to the soil while growing, compared to corn which only takes
from the environment and can be a much more intensive as far as the
inputs required to grow them.  Many farmers will utilize crop rotations
where soybeans and corn are planted in alternating years to reduce the
amount of fertilizers used during the corn year.  Increasing the demand
for soybeans will help that balance.  (Where ethanol will tip the
balance towards more corn.)

Anyway, there are a lot of issues there, but probably not directly
related to building simulation.

I only know the UK scene - but Foamglass (rigid foam board from recycled
glass), and sheep's wool (expensive) or hemp insulation are all perfectly
good for commercial buildings.

Check out the Green Directory on our website - www.sust.org

Kind regards

As a point of interest, I have been conducting studies into the cost effectiveness of thermal insulation since the 1980s and practically every insulation is a green product when viewed over its life cycle.  Personally, I like mineral fiber wool insulation made from recycled slag, but there are times when foam insulation materials with a high resistance to moisture make the most sense in an envelope assembly.  The real crime is the sub-optimal utilization of thermal insulation causing the present building stock in North America to contain less than half the amount of insulation needed to attain sustainability targets. I think we should take it one step at a time.  First, properly insulate and detail the envelope for efficient and durable performance, then look for suitable insulation materials with lower environmental impacts.  An important question to ask is which approach buys us the most time and results in the least detriment.  Build well, live well.

This is a challenge. I don't find soy being that great of an solution
given
soybeans are not the ideal crop for sustainability, and the protein used
is
can be used for other things to make the foam. I think the best product
is
straw products such as Stramit, but there are very limited options in
the US.
Agriboard is a SIP panel with straw and is expensive upfront but will
pay off
in overall savings. Again, these are probably not the solutions you are
looking for in this large commercial project either, but that is mostly
what I
have come across.

I also don't care for foam in that it is not a product that promotes
later
reuse of the materials, or a more dynamic interactive envelop. In the
end, it
seems like it mostly a trade-off to just have good "green" by saving in
operation cost with good insulation and work for new products. If there
are
better alternatives out there I would love to know as well.

Does anyone know of any insulation materials that are particularly
environmentally friendly in terms of embodied energy and life cycle
cost?

I am familiar with a soy-based spray foam and have heard of recycled
denim insulation being used in residential projects, but this is for a
large commercial project in which code requires flame retardant
insulation.

Any ideas on green insulation materials that could be used in commercial
buildings?

Thanks a lot!

All,
 
What is the best way to tell, directly or indirectly, if eQuest
calculations (i.e. results) are reflective of the latest changes to the
input files?  
 
It would be nice if there was a flag in the user interface somewhere
(e.g. Trace) -- the only method that comes to mind is comparing file
save date and times from the baseline file vs. the parametric runs.
 
 
Thanks...

I agree with the recommendation to check out DAYSIM; it's free, works very
nicely with ECOTECT, and in my experience, gives useful and accurate
results. I've provided a link to a .pdf that gives an excellent (and
succinct) introduction to using DAYSIM with ECOTECT.

Dear All

Please help me?

I would greatly appreciate if you could tell me how I can convert TMY2 
format into Bin
weather data format that proper for DOE2.

There is program in doe2 website, but I don't know what and how use 
this program.
I attach one file of this format for you.
Please tell me how exactly shall I do.

I will greatly appreciate
Best regard

Anna---

The EIR in eQUEST is the combined efficiency of the unit condenser and
compressor while the ASHRAE code EER or SEER values are the entire
packaged unit efficiency.  You'll notice if you enter a published EER or
SEER in the wizard and then check the EIR output in the detailed edit
mode, it does not equal 3.413/EER because it isn't taking into account
the fan efficiency or inefficiency depending on how you look at it.

If you are doing a model for LEED, the way I have been advised to model
packaged units is to enter the ASHRAE Table values in the wizard (EER or
SEER) and let the program parse out the components of EIR and fan power.
Then, calculate the baseline fan efficiency and enter that number in the
detailed edit mode, overriding the wizard created value.

I have heard from members on the ASHRAE committee that Appendix G does
not handle this issue very well and it seems to be something that could
be refined.  If anyone out there has a more definitive stance on the
proper way to model packaged units in eQUEST with regards to
ASHRAE/Appendix G, please chime in.

Hello all, 

I have a quick question about the Cooling EIR in
eQuest. If I got COP from ASHRAE90.1-2004 Table 6.8.1,
then EIR=1/COP. Does this caculation include the
supply fan electrical energy already or not? 

Thanks for your help.

Leonard,

I haven't done extensive daylighting simulation in Ecotect but I know that
Ecotect uses split flux method to compute internally reflected component
that tends to overpredict daylight levels at sensor points away from
openings.

Using Radiance or Radiance based software like DAYSIM or IES <VE> could be a
better option.

I am modeling some exterior shades and it seems that the impact on
internal light levels is not being reflected to the degree I would
expect.  Now I know the algorithm used uses a diffuse sky rather than
direct radiation, but still the effect of the shades does not seem to

Folks,
 
I often use the air side summary report within the equest file (a tab on the air side HVAC sytem)  as a quick check.  However for one of my projects I realised that the results shown (sqft/ton) in this summary report were completely different from the results in the sim file (both weather file and design day).  has anyone experienced this, or has a good explanation.  What could I be doing wrong?

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200708272156.AA5615437pd80001481157@gard.com>

In my quest to make my HVAC models more realistic I am looking for some
measured part load data for VAV fans with variable speed drives.  The
theoretical part load curves I have show a rapid fall in fan power as
flowrate decreases. (something like a power of 2.5 curve)
 
A common design in Australia uses a  variable speed drive to maintain a
minimum supply duct static pressure (typically 200 to 300 Pa).  This
puts a floor under the part load curve at low flowrates.
 
The other factor I'm interested in is how the efficiency of the fan,
motor and VSD change with reducing flow-rate.
 
Can anyone point me to published data from real VAV installations?
 
Thanks in advance,

Jeff or BLDG-SIM users:

 

I was wondering what the status was for eQUEST being approved by the DOE
for use in EPACT 2005 building tax deductions.  The latest list I saw of
approved software did not have eQUEST on it and I'm curious if the
paperwork has been submitted or if there is a tentative date when
approval is expected.  Any information is greatly appreciated as most of
our energy models are performed using eQUEST.

Praveer,

Genetic Algorithms and Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithms have been 
examined for building design in the paper below. See also the references 
cited in this paper for other applications of GA. Financial aspects can 
be included in single objective optimization either as the cost function 
or as a constraints, or they can be considered by using multi-objective 
optimization.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200708271506.AA0658781pd80001480870@gard.com>

Hello,

I am creating an eQUEST baseline for a multifamily residential building in
New York City.  As such, all the HVAC systems are set to PTAC and as per NYC
building code, the ventilation rate is set ~3 times as high as ASHRAE 62.  I
receive warning messages in the SIM file for each system (see below for a
representative warning message).  I am not sure what eQUEST is trying to
tell me, but I suspect that it is saying that it has increased the amount of
outdoor air intake in order to equalize that with the unusually high exhaust
CFM specified.  I pasted the language from DOE-2 help on "EXHAUST-FLOW"
below.  Can anyone confirm or deny if my suspicion is correct?

Thanks in advance for your help.

Best,
Andy


 **WARNING**********************************************************************
             ZONE EL1 NW Perim Zn (G.NW6)          in SYSTEM EL1 Sys1 (PTAC)
(G.NW6)
             has unused EXHAUST-CFM specified.
             This has been converted to outside air.
....

FROM DOE-2 Help:
EXHAUST-FLOW

Flow rate (in standard, or sea level, cfm) of direct exhaust from the zone.
This data entry can be omitted if there is no exhaust from the zone, or if
there is only central exhaust by way of the system return. The SYSTEMS
program does not simulate heat recovery from zone exhaust, but only from
central exhaust. If heat is to be recovered, zone exhaust should not be
entered but rather allowed to default to the central system. Return fan
static should be adjusted, on a weighted average basis, to reflect zone
exhaust fan conditions. The program will not allow MIN-OUTSIDE-AIR to be
less than the sum of EXHAUST-FLOWs for all zones divided by the sum of
supply cfm's for all zones. That is, MIN-OUTSIDE-AIR will not restrict the
operation of exhaust fans.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200708271033.AA3307234pd80001480524@gard.com>

I am modeling a building in Maryland with an HVAC system that fits  
into either System 7 or System 8 in 90.1 Appendix G.  I have consulted  
with several other engineers as well as the LEED FAQ, but have found  
no detailed description of whether to use the fossil fuel (System 7)  
or electric (System 8) system as a baseline (Table G3.1.1A).  A model  
with an electric system will obviously show larger savings with  
whatever the proposed building is, but if I'm able to do this then why  
would anyone ever choose the fossil fuel option as a baseline?   
(nowhere does it mention that the baseline fuel must match the  
proposed fuel).

Apologies for this not being purely a 'simulation' question.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200708270955.AA5518671pd80001480360@gard.com>

Hello Everyone,

 

Using EQuest 3.6 for LEED modeling, I am trying to find the best method to
model a heating and exhaust fan system for mechanical rooms and other
equipment rooms that are not designed to have mechanical cooling.  I know
that EQuest has a heating/ventilating system type.  Is this the best system
to use and what schedules do I need to create?  I would like to have exhaust
fans turn on at a certain room temperature (say 80?F) and unit heaters turn
on at 60?F.  I would like both to remain off when the room temperature is in
between these two setpoints.

 

Any suggestions are appreciated.

 

John

David,
Thank you for your perspective.
 
The 2% to 5% to 7% to 10% range is interesting and I read that as the
variability in one model.  So what would that mean for the delta between
two models?  Has anyone studied this relating to the ECB method or
Appendix G?  Is our industry's variability due to practice a LEED point
or two or more?  If so what does that mean for our overall margin of
error?
 
Heat pumps and VRV would be interesting but what about even a VAV with
reheat with reset of supply air temperature and static pressure.  And a
lot of projects are presumably comparing these systems. 
 
The encouragement seems limited.  So perhaps the stalwarts of the
industry have achieved the sweet spot between effort and accuracy for
their modeling goals.  But what what about all of the new comers to our
field?
 
Enough with the rallying cry.  Time to do the literature search.  If the
best practices for zoning etc are clear in the detailed research I want
to elevate them.  And if not I want to help us get to them.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Zoning Granularity in Modeling



I remember an example from my BLAST support days in the BLAST User's
Manual where there was an example for a simple building at Fort
Monmouth, NJ showing the difference between a one-zone and seven-zone
model.  (I think the annual difference was 5% to 7%?)

I agree with "the Paul's" that there are definitely going to be a large
number of projects where you've got to put in some detailed zoning to
realistically model the building.  For some system types such as for a
water-loop heat pump system (or City Multi when that is available!), one
of the premises may be that energy can be transferred from zones that
need cooling to zones that need heating.  Obviously you won't capture
this effect unless these areas are separate zones.

So the issue of "granularity" is going to depend a lot on the system
type and building usage.  If the granularity "test" is applied to an
office building where the operation is homogeneous and all of the zones
have the same internal gains and same schedules, then maybe you get 2%
to 10% difference or less between a single-zone model and a hundred zone
model.  For the more complicated building or zoning dependent system, it
may be much more.

As for a research project to study this...it will be limited in
usefulness depending on the number of variables that you can account for
in the buildings to be modeled.  I sense much extrapolation and less
interpolation.  Unless you are Wal-Mart or a spec office developer.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Zoning Granularity in Modeling

 

I agree with Paul's statement that the extent of zoning often falls
between the two scenarios previously mentioned.  My experience modeling
complex buildings has shown that more extensive zoning is often
required, especially if we desire to produce more "honest" and "useful"
results.  Paul suggests studying the issue of granularity.  Is anyone
aware of work that has been done on this topic?  Has anyone made a
comparison of three zoning approaches for the same building (i.e. coarse
granularity in the SD phase modeling; coarse granularity in the detailed
phase modeling; and fine/medium granularity in the detailed phase
modeling)?  What sort of results are seen?  

 

With LEED, EPACT, and code-compliance modeling on the rise, it seems
that the energy modeling community would want to affirm or reaffirm the
approach to zoning granularity that would best provide a balance of
credibility (usefulness), consistency (i.e. % savings) and value
(time/budget), seeing as many clients in the marketplace are skeptical
of energy modeling.

Thank you Kevin & Jeff for showing everyone the extreme range of
modeling approaches in our profession.  I happen to think the answer is
somewhere in the middle for most buildings types and analysis goals.  

Given the rise of LEED & EPACT, our industry needs more published best
practices addressing things like zoning granularity but before we can
write those we probably need to study them. 

Would anyone like to work together to find money and/or time to study
how sensitive energy and savings predictions are to zoning granularity
or other basic modeling practices?

Ok, this could be embarrassing, but I got to know.



Could anyone shed some light on this error message I keep getting?  As
it turns out, I ended up with 405 zones.  I heard Doe-2.1 was limited to
99zones, is there a new limit for Doe 2.2. 



I was under the assumption that when modeling for LEED certification
each space in the architectural design should be modeled as a separate
space for building simulation, is this thought right or completely
wrong?  Thanks for the help.

Employment offer: 

Engineer for Dynamic Thermal Simulation with TRNSYS

Transsolar Inc.
145 Hudson Street
New York City, NY 10013

Transsolar is a German-based climate engineering firm, and one of the premier such offices in the world. We are seeking a talented, highly motivated engineer for the New York office. 

Our work is to develop and validate concepts for high quality environments that require minimal energy use. To achieve this we work collaboratively within the design team from the start of the design process, considering each step from the standpoint of fundamental thermodynamics. This generates a climate concept in which form, material, and mechanical systems are synergistic components of a well-orchestrated climate control system; and conversely, an environmental control strategy that is integral to the architectural concept. 

We use dynamic thermal simulation on TRNSYS to develop and validate appropriate, reliable concepts in relationship to the complex set of factors that is unique to each project.

Qualifications are, in order of importance:

*	Education related to building energy flows: newtonian physics, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, solar geometry and daylighting, etc. Ideal is a degree in mechanical engineering. 
*	Education/professional experience with architectural and mechanical systems for building climate control 
*	Experience with dynamic thermal simulation, preferably TRNSYS 
*	Computer-based drawing skills (e.g. Corel Draw, Adobe Illustrator, etc) 
*	Excellent oral and written communication skills

Transsolar engineers are often specialized in their work, but all carry out a broad range of tasks. Responsibilities may include but are not limited to:

*	Design and validation of ongoing projects via TRNSYS simulation. 
*	Collaboration with German Transsolar offices 
*	Project coordination 
*	Participation in meetings and design charettes 
*	Graphical representation of climate and energy concepts 
*	Writing reports and correspondence

 to all
i am interested to know the various applications of intelligent building
design in context with energy systems and different structural design
parameters using AI applications or genetic algorathims.However the
financial aspects remains an important criteria in deciding for the
different applications to the building systems but the systems performance
outweighs the economics, kindly suggest the appropriate
lighting,HVAC,Structural designs.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200708241446.AA4634125pd80001479369@gard.com>

Karen,
 
not sure I totally understand eQUEST options either... here's my shot:
 
the relevant keywords are: 
 
- MIN-OUTSIDE-AIR
- OA-SIZING-METHOD
- MIN-OA-METHOD
- MIN-AIR-SCH
 
and
 
- OA-CONTROL
 
if you search on these in the "DOE22Vol2-Dictionary.pdf" document from
doe2.com, you'll see options for OA CFM control, which include fixed
quantity, increased vent for economizer, and decreased minimum
ventilation for CO2 control.
 
Under DOE-2.1e, often the default was fixed quantity OA; I modeled DCV
by correlating a minimum outside air schedule to the occupant schedule.
 
If you look at your BDL file you can see how what defaults eQUEST is
generating and the relevant differences between your systems.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Demand Controlled ventilation in eQuest


Hello all,
 
I'm a little confused by eQuest's options for ventilation air and
control.
 
When I specify OA-FLOW/PER, this value seems to become my minimum
outdoor air flow.  I would expect this entry to follow the occupancy
schedule and modulate with demand, or at least to have the option to
schedule the OA flow. 
 
When an economizer is specified, the total energy use drops
significantly and the loads seem to modulate with the OA flow (although
there may be some other effects going on here too).
 
Any ideas on why this happens?  Is there any way to model a
demand-controlled system that does not have an economizer attached?
 
Thanks,
 
~karen~

MessageIn version 3.61 and earlier the eQUEST wizards do not have an option for
DX AHU with PIU zone boxes.  However, in the detail mode, if a PIU system has
been defined you can open the AHU property sheet, go to the cooling tab and
on the coil Cap/Control subtab change the Cool Source from chilled water to
Electric DX.  You should then set to default any CHW loop connection and
related values (lower in that column on the subtab) and then you can delete
the chiller(s), cooling tower(s) and CHW loop (in that order) if no longer
used.

In the next release (3.62) DX cooling for PIU AHUs will also available in the wizards.

I remember an example from my BLAST support days in the BLAST User's
Manual where there was an example for a simple building at Fort
Monmouth, NJ showing the difference between a one-zone and seven-zone
model.  (I think the annual difference was 5% to 7%?)

I agree with "the Paul's" that there are definitely going to be a large
number of projects where you've got to put in some detailed zoning to
realistically model the building.  For some system types such as for a
water-loop heat pump system (or City Multi when that is available!), one
of the premises may be that energy can be transferred from zones that
need cooling to zones that need heating.  Obviously you won't capture
this effect unless these areas are separate zones.

So the issue of "granularity" is going to depend a lot on the system
type and building usage.  If the granularity "test" is applied to an
office building where the operation is homogeneous and all of the zones
have the same internal gains and same schedules, then maybe you get 2%
to 10% difference or less between a single-zone model and a hundred zone
model.  For the more complicated building or zoning dependent system, it
may be much more.

As for a research project to study this...it will be limited in
usefulness depending on the number of variables that you can account for
in the buildings to be modeled.  I sense much extrapolation and less
interpolation.  Unless you are Wal-Mart or a spec office developer.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Zoning Granularity in Modeling

 

I agree with Paul's statement that the extent of zoning often falls
between the two scenarios previously mentioned.  My experience modeling
complex buildings has shown that more extensive zoning is often
required, especially if we desire to produce more "honest" and "useful"
results.  Paul suggests studying the issue of granularity.  Is anyone
aware of work that has been done on this topic?  Has anyone made a
comparison of three zoning approaches for the same building (i.e. coarse
granularity in the SD phase modeling; coarse granularity in the detailed
phase modeling; and fine/medium granularity in the detailed phase
modeling)?  What sort of results are seen?  

 

With LEED, EPACT, and code-compliance modeling on the rise, it seems
that the energy modeling community would want to affirm or reaffirm the
approach to zoning granularity that would best provide a balance of
credibility (usefulness), consistency (i.e. % savings) and value
(time/budget), seeing as many clients in the marketplace are skeptical
of energy modeling.

Thank you Kevin & Jeff for showing everyone the extreme range of
modeling approaches in our profession.  I happen to think the answer is
somewhere in the middle for most buildings types and analysis goals.  

Given the rise of LEED & EPACT, our industry needs more published best
practices addressing things like zoning granularity but before we can
write those we probably need to study them. 

Would anyone like to work together to find money and/or time to study
how sensitive energy and savings predictions are to zoning granularity
or other basic modeling practices?

Ok, this could be embarrassing, but I got to know.



Could anyone shed some light on this error message I keep getting?  As
it turns out, I ended up with 405 zones.  I heard Doe-2.1 was limited to
99zones, is there a new limit for Doe 2.2. 



I was under the assumption that when modeling for LEED certification
each space in the architectural design should be modeled as a separate
space for building simulation, is this thought right or completely
wrong?  Thanks for the help.

Newer DOE-2.2 versions allow choice of keyword COOL-SOURCE for PIU
system type. Values either ELEC-DX or CHILLED-WATER. Choosing
COOL-SOURCE = ELEC-DX and, for the zones, TERMINAL-TYPE = PARALLEL
creates "System 6." 

 

This option may only be available in text mode. See the latest  I can't
find it on the menu screens in my version of EQ v3.61.

Hello. 

There are several papers on this, including a couple of MS theses where we looked at this for the Zachry Engineering Center, which was used for the ASHRAE predictor shootout I and II. Runs we're made for 5, 20 and 96 zones for the 300,000 ft2 bldg. 

Bottom line, if the zone temps are the same, and the systems are the same, including operation, then 2 to 5 zones gets the job done. Beyond that adds diversity to the simulation, however the daily and monthly results are nearly identical.

Why do you need so many zones? Five per floor is the usual, two can also
suffice.

Ok, this could be embarrassing, but I got to know.

 

Could anyone shed some light on this error message I keep getting?  As
it turns out, I ended up with 405 zones.  I heard Doe-2.1 was limited to
99zones, is there a new limit for Doe 2.2. 

 

I was under the assumption that when modeling for LEED certification
each space in the architectural design should be modeled as a separate
space for building simulation, is this thought right or completely
wrong?  Thanks for the help.

	I would like to discuss question number 1 as well.  Appendix G
specifies that Direct Expansion be used as the cooling type for System
6.  However, the PIU system in eQuest does not allow you to use DX
coils.  I have seen several archived posts on this same question that
say to model a chiller equivalent to the DX coils, but nothing further.
I have redefined the chiller performance curves accordingly with no
success.  Has anyone set up this system succesfully in eQuest?  
	 
	In response to Questions 2 and 3, the U-value and Shading
Coefficient of the glass has significant impact on the energy savings
with the HVAC system.  In addition, the visible light transmittance of
the glass directly impacts the Daylighting controls within the rooms
affecting electric usage.  The selection of glass should be investigated
when determining the window-wall ratio and the resulting savings.

		Hello All,

		Quick question on System 6: Package VAV w/PFP boxes.

		1.	How do you use system 6 in eQUEST? Do you have
to use parallel PIU at the zone? 
		2.	At what percentage of window to wall ratio that
high efficiency can star contribute significant saving? 
		3.	At what number is considered significant saving?


		Any respond is greatly appreciated.

Ying,

Below are a few links that demonstrate how to approach an analysis of a
DSF in eQuest.  Although these resources are not too detailed, they
provide a good place to start. I will also be investigating a DSF
through an energy model in eQuest and through CFD simulations in Airpak.
If anyone has developed techniques for modeling the benefits of a DSF in
eQuest that would be extremely helpful.

Ying,

I would use thermal and network mass flow predictions to drive a CFD domain 
representative of the double skin facade. The software of choice is ESP-r. If 
you quite keen on the topic, there will be a presentation about using CFD 
within strongly transient domains in the forthcoming IBPSA China event.

I agree with Paul's statement that the extent of zoning often falls between the two scenarios previously mentioned.  My experience modeling complex buildings has shown that more extensive zoning is often required, especially if we desire to produce more "honest" and "useful" results.  Paul suggests studying the issue of granularity.  Is anyone aware of work that has been done on this topic?  Has anyone made a comparison of three zoning approaches for the same building (i.e. coarse granularity in the SD phase modeling; coarse granularity in the detailed phase modeling; and fine/medium granularity in the detailed phase modeling)?  What sort of results are seen?  
 
With LEED, EPACT, and code-compliance modeling on the rise, it seems that the energy modeling community would want to affirm or reaffirm the approach to zoning granularity that would best provide a balance of credibility (usefulness), consistency (i.e. % savings) and value (time/budget), seeing as many clients in the marketplace are skeptical of energy modeling.

Thank you Kevin & Jeff for showing everyone the extreme range of
modeling approaches in our profession.  I happen to think the answer is
somewhere in the middle for most buildings types and analysis goals.  

Given the rise of LEED & EPACT, our industry needs more published best
practices addressing things like zoning granularity but before we can
write those we probably need to study them. 

Would anyone like to work together to find money and/or time to study

The default for VAV is to send air to the zones at 55F (13C). Depending on how much outdoor air is part of the supply air, you may/may not need heating at the system level. The increase from 55F to 90F (or whatever the supply temp is during heating) happens at the reheat coils (which are at the zone level). The preheat will depend on the amount of outside air. Hope this helps.

Thanks, Michael.
 
I did try the steps according to your suggestions. But I found the following issues.
 
In my model (detail model), I did not install  the preheat coil. After I install the preheat coil, I found that no matter how I increase the capacity, the heating energy use for preheat coil is very small. I also tried to put design day data into the detail mdel, it igave me the same result too.
 
Based on my understanding, the zone level reheat coils are for space heating load through building envelpe and infiltration; the main system heat coil is to handle ventilation heating load. The preheat coil is just to preheat incoming air to prevent frost.
 
So I dont understan why the heat and preheat coil heeat energy use is so small in the very cold climate (zone 7). In my model, the heat recovery was not installed and the space type is regular office.
 
Any suggestion is greatly appreciated.
 
Thanks.

	If you do not assign a capacity for the preheat coil, it is self sized based on heating design day information (not the outside temperature from the weather file).

	Hi Aulbach,
	 
	Thanks for your reply. Yes, I inpu everything into the detail mode. Based on the system design in climate. The air system has three typies of heating: 1) preheating for preheating the incoming air to around 5 degree C; 2) main system heating coil to heat the incoming air (this heat coil is arranged after cooling coil); 3) reheat coil, this is the reheat coil in zone level to meet the zone temperature requirement.

		Dear All,
		 
		I experienced an issue when I use eQUEST. I model a building in cold climate with VAV system. In the wizard mode, I found the system heat source is "not installed". But when I change to electricity, I found the heating enery use for system heating is zero. I also tried other options, always found that the system heat source is useless. I found that all the heating goes the zone level. Based on my understanding, this should not be the real case.
		 
		I set the air supply temperature as constant as 55F (around 13 degree C), zone entering max air tem as 95F. Enen I set the zone entering max air tem as 86 (30 C). The system heating coil still has no load.
		 
		Has anyone experience the same problem before and know to to solve this problem?
		 
		Thanks a lot.

  Once you have "cookie cuttered" your building in the Wizards, switch to the Detailed Mode. There you will find your preheat coil.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] eQUEST-System no heating
    Dear All,

     

    I experienced an issue when I use eQUEST. I model a building in cold climate with VAV system. In the wizard mode, I found the system heat source is "not installed". But when I change to electricity, I found the heating enery use for system heating is zero. I also tried other options, always found that the system heat source is useless. I found that all the heating goes the zone level. Based on my understanding, this should not be the real case.

     

    I set the air supply temperature as constant as 55F (around 13 degree C), zone entering max air tem as 95F. Enen I set the zone entering max air tem as 86 (30 C). The system heating coil still has no load.

     

    Has anyone experience the same problem before and know to to solve this problem?

     

    Thanks a lot.

     

    Regards,

     

    David

Thank you Kevin & Jeff for showing everyone the extreme range of
modeling approaches in our profession.  I happen to think the answer is
somewhere in the middle for most buildings types and analysis goals.  

Given the rise of LEED & EPACT, our industry needs more published best
practices addressing things like zoning granularity but before we can
write those we probably need to study them. 

Would anyone like to work together to find money and/or time to study
how sensitive energy and savings predictions are to zoning granularity
or other basic modeling practices?

Why do you need so many zones? Five per floor is the usual, two can also
suffice.

Ok, this could be embarrassing, but I got to know.

 

Could anyone shed some light on this error message I keep getting?  As
it turns out, I ended up with 405 zones.  I heard Doe-2.1 was limited to
99zones, is there a new limit for Doe 2.2. 

 

I was under the assumption that when modeling for LEED certification
each space in the architectural design should be modeled as a separate
space for building simulation, is this thought right or completely
wrong?  Thanks for the help.

Dear All,

 

I'm currently looking at problems which may arise due to stack effect in a high rise mixed use building in London. Although most tall buildings these days have relatively good air tightness the proposed building will have the possibility of air penetrating the office fa?ades from about 20m to 100m (70ft to 330ft) and again where there is apartments from 180m to 230m (600ft to 760ft). It is also possible that significant infiltration will occur at the top of the building. A number of lift shafts and stairwells under worst case situations allow this air to travel the full or close to the full height of the building. 

I have found a number of papers which discuss this topic but I haven't come across a means of quickly estimating worst case scenario pressure differences for individual lift shaft or stairwells. Does anyone know of a calculation tool or similar which could do this. I have downloaded a program called COMTAMW. Does anyone know if this is a useful programme for proposed buildings where all the parameters are not know and may have to be estimated?

 

Kind Regards,

 

Kevin Burke

Hi Aleka,
 
There could be other automatic means acceptable to the local authority
having jurisdiction.  A timer might be one example (off at night, on during
the day).   A good place to start is to ask the code official.  Also check
the code, such as the IMC 2003 if that is what is adopted for the project.
 
Cheers,

Are parking garage ventilation fans required to have some kind of control
that prevents them from running continuously (such as CO sensors)?  I'm
trying to determine whether or not there's an argument for claiming savings
for CO sensors under Appendix G.  My interpretation of section 6.4.3.3.5 in
90.1: "....shall have automatic controls.....capable of shutting off fans
when not required," is that such a control system is required by code.
Also, this seems like standard practice.  Anyone have any insight as to
whether this interpretation is accurate?

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Citi Multi Variable Refrigerant System


Hello again,
 
I recieved some great information from Sam Mason who is an environmental
designer at Atelier Ten Consulting Environmental Designers in New York.
He researched the City Multi for his Masters. Thank you Sam for your
help! 
 
Here it is:
 
Dana,

The City Multi was the topic of my master's project and I ran into
several 
problems trying to the model the system. My conclusion was that
using eQUEST, it is not possible to model the system for a few reasons.
There is also a lack of information from Mitsubishi that makes modeling
tough.
 
First, with regards to each indoor unit, setting a constant EIR (like
you mentioned doing) does not allow for the variation in performance due
to temperature changes in the space and outdoors. If you look in the
engineering manual, there are power and capacity relations for each unit
at various temperatures. These corrections need to be incorporated for
each indoor unit and this may be possible using ms-dos batch files.
 
Second, there is no way to account for the free-energy BC controller
operation in terms of refrigerant transferred to/from zones and the
effectiveness at which the refrigerant used. Even though the coil loads
would be known for each zone from DOE2, the state and temperature of the
refrigerant would be needed to figure out how much energy is available
fro space conditioning in other zones.
 
Third, DOE2 is steady-state modeling software, but this system is hugely
dynamic. From my monitoring of the system, I found that the compressor
cycles at various frequencies over the course of one minute, thus
changing the capacity of the system hundreds of times an hour. Energy
Plus might be a better tool because it can run at 15 minute intervals.
Fourth, Mitsubishi does not supply the part load curves for the
compressor operation. This means there is no way to accurately model
the unloading and part load performance of the compressor. In addition,
it is an inverter driven and not a hard start compressor, so the part
load performance should be quite good.
 
These systems are going to become
more popular and already are in certain areas. I have found one paper
referring to a module for energy plus that models these types of
systems, but I cannot get a hold of the author. I also know that energy
soft has been working on developing a module for their software, but I
do not know the status.

	Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Citi Multi Variable Refrigerant System
	
	
	Hello all,
	 
	We have recently performed an analysis on a building that is
potentially going to incorporate the City Multi system. After many hours
of going through eQUEST, I devised a method of modeling it that I would
like to run past you all for any thoughts/ideas. 
	 
	First, for those not aware of the problems, here is a background
of the systems:
	 
	The City Multi system consists of essentially three parts: the
condenser, the BC controller, and the heat exchanger unit at each zone.
Refrigerant is the only property used for heat exchange, i.e. there is
no water running from the condenser to the controller to the zone units.
Each zone unit is essentially a fan coil, in that there is no compressor
work at the zone, only fan energy. The BC controller is essentially a
heat exchanger which gives the City Multi system a large advantage by
being able to transfer heat, say from the south face of a building, to
the north face, which is in the shade. All of the individual zone units
connect to the BC controller and the BC controller distributes the
refrigerant accordingly. If there is not enough free energy being
generated by the system, the compressor kicks in and supplies or rejects
heat from the loop to meet the demand. 
	 
	To model this in eQUEST, which has been suggested before, the
water source heat pump system should be selected in order to account for
the free transfer of heat from zone to zone. There are, however, several
problems with this. One is that pumping energy is required to pump the
water throughout the building. The second problem is that at each zone,
each heat pump runs a compression cycle in order to supply or reject
heat to or from the zone to the water loop. The third is that a boiler
and cooling tower take the place for the condenser in the City Multi
system. Each system requires a make-up air unit which can be modeled the
same in each simulation.
	 
	Now here is what I would like you all to review: 
	 
	These are some of the steps I went to in order to make the water
source heat pump as much like the City Multi as possible.

	*	Made the boiler and electric boiler (to simulate the
electric compressor) and gave it the appropriate heating EIR that was
specified in the Citi Multi specification manual. I gave the fan the
same EIR as the cooling side of the compressor in the same manual. 
	*	I made a spreadsheet to subtract out the pumping energy
(only from the water loop! Not the DHW loop!) to simulate the suction of
the refrigerant through the building in the City Multi system. I had to
do this in the BEPS and the BEPU report which made it kind of a hassle
to find the energy cost savings. 
	*	For each heat pump, I set the EIR equal to 0.0001 to
simulate the fan coil in the City Multi system. Therefore, whatever heat
is transferred to or from the water loop is only shown with the fan
energy from blowing the air over the coils. IF this is not a proper way
to do it, then what should the EIR be? It cannot be the EIR from the
condenser, because that has nothing to do with the free heat transfer
energy at the zones. 

	What do you guys think about this approach? I figure that since
this is a tough problem that other people have encountered as well, I
might as well use this huge resource that has many great minds to come
to a solution.

Look at SV-A report to see if there is a "main" heating coil (Top rows,
HEATING CAPACITY KBTU/HR > 0 if DOE-2 has simulated it), not just a
preheat coil. (PH coils don't control to reset schedule, etc.)

 

In addition to setting a "heating source"

 

Somewhere, wiz, detailed, text, whatever, you gotta either:

Set  "HEAT-SET-T"  (in "Detailed" menu: system, heating, heating "Hot
Deck Max Leaving Temp" on right side, blank by default) to a number
greater than MIN-SUPPLY-T ; i.e. 60-65F

OR 

Manually input the central coil heating capacity, text =
HEATING-CAPACITY (menu, same system heating page as above, "Heating
Capacity")

I am going to take a stab at this one. In eQuest, a VAV system is a
Terminal System. Therefore, in the Wizard, the zone level is where all
heating and/or reheating is done (and developed). You have to force a
primary heating source to occur, but this doesn't appear in the Wizard
mode, apparently..

 

Have you input a Reheat-Delta-T? The temperature of 55 DegF + 40 DegF =
95 DegF heating supply temp.

 

I also do NOT find the ability to create a pre heat coil in the Wizard.
I have done it, but am quite sure this was input in the Detailed
Interface Mode. There are MANY eQuest features that become available
(like more SYSTEM-TYPES) in the Detailed Mode.

 

Once you have "cookie cuttered" your building in the Wizards, switch to
the Detailed Mode. There you will find your preheat coil.

Dear All,

 

I experienced an issue when I use eQUEST. I model a building in cold
climate with VAV system. In the wizard mode, I found the system heat
source is "not installed". But when I change to electricity, I found the
heating enery use for system heating is zero. I also tried other
options, always found that the system heat source is useless. I found
that all the heating goes the zone level. Based on my understanding,
this should not be the real case.

 

I set the air supply temperature as constant as 55F (around 13 degree
C), zone entering max air tem as 95F. Enen I set the zone entering max
air tem as 86 (30 C). The system heating coil still has no load.

 

Has anyone experience the same problem before and know to to solve this
problem?

 

Thanks a lot.

Hi Aulbach,
   
  Thanks for your reply. Yes, I inpu everything into the detail mode. Based on the system design in climate. The air system has three typies of heating: 1) preheating for preheating the incoming air to around 5 degree C; 2) main system heating coil to heat the incoming air (this heat coil is arranged after cooling coil); 3) reheat coil, this is the reheat coil in zone level to meet the zone temperature requirement.
   
  The one I found is the 2) main system heating coil never works. In the model, the preheating coil was ignored. Seems that all heating load goes to the zone level reheat coil.
   
  Any idea about this?
   
  Thanks.

I would like to discuss question number 1 as well.  Appendix G specifies
that Direct Expansion be used as the cooling type for System 6.
However, the PIU system in eQuest does not allow you to use DX coils.  I
have seen several archived posts on this same question that say to model
a chiller equivalent to the DX coils, but nothing further.  I have
redefined the chiller performance curves accordingly with no success.
Has anyone set up this system succesfully in eQuest?  
 
In response to Questions 2 and 3, the U-value and Shading Coefficient of
the glass has significant impact on the energy savings with the HVAC
system.  In addition, the visible light transmittance of the glass
directly impacts the Daylighting controls within the rooms affecting
electric usage.  The selection of glass should be investigated when
determining the window-wall ratio and the resulting savings.

Where HVAC zones are defined on HVAC design drawings, each

HVAC zone shall be modeled as a separate thermal block.

Exception: Different HVAC zones may be combined to create a

single thermal block or identical thermal blocks to which multipliers

are applied, provided that all of the following conditions are

met:

(a) The space use classification is the same throughout the thermal

(b) All HVAC zones in the thermal block that are adjacent to glazed

exterior walls face the same orientation or their orientations vary by

Hello again,
 
I recieved some great information from Sam Mason who is an environmental designer at Atelier Ten Consulting Environmental Designers in New York. He researched the City Multi for his Masters. Thank you Sam for your help! 
 
Here it is:
 
Dana,

The City Multi was the topic of my master's project and I ran into several 
problems trying to the model the system. My conclusion was that
using eQUEST, it is not possible to model the system for a few reasons.
There is also a lack of information from Mitsubishi that makes modeling
tough.
 
First, with regards to each indoor unit, setting a constant EIR (like
you mentioned doing) does not allow for the variation in performance due
to temperature changes in the space and outdoors. If you look in the
engineering manual, there are power and capacity relations for each unit
at various temperatures. These corrections need to be incorporated for
each indoor unit and this may be possible using ms-dos batch files.
 
Second, there is no way to account for the free-energy BC controller
operation in terms of refrigerant transferred to/from zones and the
effectiveness at which the refrigerant used. Even though the coil loads
would be known for each zone from DOE2, the state and temperature of the
refrigerant would be needed to figure out how much energy is available
fro space conditioning in other zones.
 
Third, DOE2 is steady-state modeling software, but this system is hugely
dynamic. From my monitoring of the system, I found that the compressor
cycles at various frequencies over the course of one minute, thus
changing the capacity of the system hundreds of times an hour. Energy
Plus might be a better tool because it can run at 15 minute intervals.
Fourth, Mitsubishi does not supply the part load curves for the
compressor operation. This means there is no way to accurately model
the unloading and part load performance of the compressor. In addition,
it is an inverter driven and not a hard start compressor, so the part
load performance should be quite good.
 
These systems are going to become
more popular and already are in certain areas. I have found one paper
referring to a module for energy plus that models these types of
systems, but I cannot get a hold of the author. I also know that energy
soft has been working on developing a module for their software, but I
do not know the status.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Citi Multi Variable Refrigerant System


Hello all,
 
We have recently performed an analysis on a building that is potentially going to incorporate the City Multi system. After many hours of going through eQUEST, I devised a method of modeling it that I would like to run past you all for any thoughts/ideas. 
 
First, for those not aware of the problems, here is a background of the systems:
 
The City Multi system consists of essentially three parts: the condenser, the BC controller, and the heat exchanger unit at each zone. Refrigerant is the only property used for heat exchange, i.e. there is no water running from the condenser to the controller to the zone units. Each zone unit is essentially a fan coil, in that there is no compressor work at the zone, only fan energy. The BC controller is essentially a heat exchanger which gives the City Multi system a large advantage by being able to transfer heat, say from the south face of a building, to the north face, which is in the shade. All of the individual zone units connect to the BC controller and the BC controller distributes the refrigerant accordingly. If there is not enough free energy being generated by the system, the compressor kicks in and supplies or rejects heat from the loop to meet the demand. 
 
To model this in eQUEST, which has been suggested before, the water source heat pump system should be selected in order to account for the free transfer of heat from zone to zone. There are, however, several problems with this. One is that pumping energy is required to pump the water throughout the building. The second problem is that at each zone, each heat pump runs a compression cycle in order to supply or reject heat to or from the zone to the water loop. The third is that a boiler and cooling tower take the place for the condenser in the City Multi system. Each system requires a make-up air unit which can be modeled the same in each simulation.
 
Now here is what I would like you all to review: 
 
These are some of the steps I went to in order to make the water source heat pump as much like the City Multi as possible.

*	Made the boiler and electric boiler (to simulate the electric compressor) and gave it the appropriate heating EIR that was specified in the Citi Multi specification manual. I gave the fan the same EIR as the cooling side of the compressor in the same manual. 

*	I made a spreadsheet to subtract out the pumping energy (only from the water loop! Not the DHW loop!) to simulate the suction of the refrigerant through the building in the City Multi system. I had to do this in the BEPS and the BEPU report which made it kind of a hassle to find the energy cost savings. 

*	For each heat pump, I set the EIR equal to 0.0001 to simulate the fan coil in the City Multi system. Therefore, whatever heat is transferred to or from the water loop is only shown with the fan energy from blowing the air over the coils. IF this is not a proper way to do it, then what should the EIR be? It cannot be the EIR from the condenser, because that has nothing to do with the free heat transfer energy at the zones. 

What do you guys think about this approach? I figure that since this is a tough problem that other people have encountered as well, I might as well use this huge resource that has many great minds to come to a solution. 
 
Please, any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

I am going to take a stab at this one. In eQuest, a VAV system is a
Terminal System. Therefore, in the Wizard, the zone level is where all
heating and/or reheating is done (and developed). You have to force a
primary heating source to occur, but this doesn't appear in the Wizard
mode, apparently..
 
Have you input a Reheat-Delta-T? The temperature of 55 DegF + 40 DegF =
95 DegF heating supply temp.
 
I also do NOT find the ability to create a pre heat coil in the Wizard.
I have done it, but am quite sure this was input in the Detailed
Interface Mode. There are MANY eQuest features that become available
(like more SYSTEM-TYPES) in the Detailed Mode.
 
Once you have "cookie cuttered" your building in the Wizards, switch to
the Detailed Mode. There you will find your preheat coil.

Dear All,
 
I experienced an issue when I use eQUEST. I model a building in cold
climate with VAV system. In the wizard mode, I found the system heat
source is "not installed". But when I change to electricity, I found the
heating enery use for system heating is zero. I also tried other
options, always found that the system heat source is useless. I found
that all the heating goes the zone level. Based on my understanding,
this should not be the real case.
 
I set the air supply temperature as constant as 55F (around 13 degree
C), zone entering max air tem as 95F. Enen I set the zone entering max
air tem as 86 (30 C). The system heating coil still has no load.
 
Has anyone experience the same problem before and know to to solve this
problem?
 
Thanks a lot.
 
Regards,
 
David

Kevin,
ContamW can be used for this purpose but you need 
to prescribe the temperatures since ContamW will 
not simultaneously compute the temperatures for 
you. It is especially useful if you used 
mechanical systems in the building and you have 
some estimation about the atrium temperature 
distributions. If you need to compute the zonal 
temperatures and infiltration airflow 
simultaneously, a better solution is to use 
Transys---which includes the multi-zone airflow 
module of ContamW, I believe---to coupled airflow and thermal simulation.

Hello All,

Quick question on System 6: Package VAV w/PFP boxes.

1.	How do you use system 6 in eQUEST? Do you have to use parallel PIU
at the zone?
2.	At what percentage of window to wall ratio that high efficiency can
star contribute significant saving?
3.	At what number is considered significant saving?

Any respond is greatly appreciated.

Ok, this could be embarrassing, but I got to know.

 

Could anyone shed some light on this error message I keep getting?  As it
turns out, I ended up with 405 zones.  I heard Doe-2.1 was limited to
99zones, is there a new limit for Doe 2.2. 

 

I was under the assumption that when modeling for LEED certification each
space in the architectural design should be modeled as a separate space for
building simulation, is this thought right or completely wrong?  Thanks for
the help.

Dear All,

 

I'm currently looking at problems which may arise due to stack effect in a high rise mixed use building in London. Although most tall buildings these days have relatively good air tightness the proposed building will have the possibility of air penetrating the office fa?ades from about 20m to 100m (70ft to 330ft) and again where there is apartments from 180m to 230m (600ft to 760ft). It is also possible that significant infiltration will occur at the top of the building. A number of lift shafts and stairwells under worst case situations allow this air to travel the full or close to the full height of the building. 

I have found a number of papers which discuss this topic but I haven't come across a means of quickly estimating worst case scenario pressure differences for individual lift shaft or stairwells. Does anyone know of a calculation tool or similar which could do this. I have downloaded a program called COMTAMW. Does anyone know if this is a useful programme for proposed buildings where all the parameters are not know and may have to be estimated?

 

Kind Regards,

 

Kevin Burke

Are parking garage ventilation fans required to have some kind of control
that prevents them from running continuously (such as CO sensors)?  I'm
trying to determine whether or not there's an argument for claiming savings
for CO sensors under Appendix G.  My interpretation of section 6.4.3.3.5 in
90.1: "....shall have automatic controls.....capable of shutting off fans
when not required," is that such a control system is required by code.
Also, this seems like standard practice.  Anyone have any insight as to
whether this interpretation is accurate?

Thanks,
Aleka

In-Reply-To: <MDAEMON-F200708220818.AA1804625pd80003501173@gard.com>
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200708221038.AA3802578pd80001476611@gard.com>

Hello all,
 
We have recently performed an analysis on a building that is potentially going to incorporate the City Multi system. After many hours of going through eQUEST, I devised a method of modeling it that I would like to run past you all for any thoughts/ideas. 
 
First, for those not aware of the problems, here is a background of the systems:
 
The City Multi system consists of essentially three parts: the condenser, the BC controller, and the heat exchanger unit at each zone. Refrigerant is the only property used for heat exchange, i.e. there is no water running from the condenser to the controller to the zone units. Each zone unit is essentially a fan coil, in that there is no compressor work at the zone, only fan energy. The BC controller is essentially a heat exchanger which gives the City Multi system a large advantage by being able to transfer heat, say from the south face of a building, to the north face, which is in the shade. All of the individual zone units connect to the BC controller and the BC controller distributes the refrigerant accordingly. If there is not enough free energy being generated by the system, the compressor kicks in and supplies or rejects heat from the loop to meet the demand. 
 
To model this in eQUEST, which has been suggested before, the water source heat pump system should be selected in order to account for the free transfer of heat from zone to zone. There are, however, several problems with this. One is that pumping energy is required to pump the water throughout the building. The second problem is that at each zone, each heat pump runs a compression cycle in order to supply or reject heat to or from the zone to the water loop. The third is that a boiler and cooling tower take the place for the condenser in the City Multi system. Each system requires a make-up air unit which can be modeled the same in each simulation.
 
Now here is what I would like you all to review: 
 
These are some of the steps I went to in order to make the water source heat pump as much like the City Multi as possible.

*	Made the boiler and electric boiler (to simulate the electric compressor) and gave it the appropriate heating EIR that was specified in the Citi Multi specification manual. I gave the fan the same EIR as the cooling side of the compressor in the same manual. 

*	I made a spreadsheet to subtract out the pumping energy (only from the water loop! Not the DHW loop!) to simulate the suction of the refrigerant through the building in the City Multi system. I had to do this in the BEPS and the BEPU report which made it kind of a hassle to find the energy cost savings. 

*	For each heat pump, I set the EIR equal to 0.0001 to simulate the fan coil in the City Multi system. Therefore, whatever heat is transferred to or from the water loop is only shown with the fan energy from blowing the air over the coils. IF this is not a proper way to do it, then what should the EIR be? It cannot be the EIR from the condenser, because that has nothing to do with the free heat transfer energy at the zones. 

What do you guys think about this approach? I figure that since this is a tough problem that other people have encountered as well, I might as well use this huge resource that has many great minds to come to a solution. 
 
Please, any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Dear all,
 
I want to use POLYGON to decribe some exterior wall or roof in DOE-2.1E-119,
input as follows:
 
TRIANG3 = POLYGON
    (0,0)  (20,0)  (20,10)  (0,10)  ..

EW-1 = EXTERIOR-WALL
    POLYGON = TRIANG3  X = 1 Y = 1  Z = 0  AZIMUTH = 180  TILT = 90  ..
 
But I find the area of EW-1 is 18.58 in output file ( REPORT LV-C ). Then I
try this keyword in DOE-2.2-44e4, the result shows the area of EW-1 is 200.
 
Also, I find building peak load using POLYGON is less than using WIDTH &
HEIGHT keywords.
 
Does anyone can tell me why?

Dear all,

What's the best tool out there to calculate an individual's and/or a
firm's carbon emissions (whose results can be used for offsetting
purposes?)

And is there a standard accepted way of organizing information to
measure emissions? 

Thanks for your help and sorry about the cross posting.

There are several tools on the web. Try this link out. This is perhaps
one of the more comprehensive calculators but still manages to keep it
simple.

This is a good start if you want to calculate the carbon footprint of a
building or a business. 

 

For a 'standard way' you might want to investigate the carbon disclosure
project and the green house gas protocol.

Hi Mark,
"Source" is a peculiar word there in G3.1.2.10.f. but I would tend to
interpret it more as an exhaust fan system rather than a diffuser, hood,
or snorkel.  

The User's Manual does not address the Appendix G section but it does
expound on the prescriptive compliance path's  matching exception in
6.5.6.1h:

"Where the largest single exhaust source is less than 75% of the design
outdoor airflow. This exception is provided to account for the
impracticality of recovering heat from multiple exhaust sources for a
single outdoor air intake. An
example could be a high-rise residential facility with a single
pressurized outdoor airshaft but a half-dozen toilet and kitchen exhaust
risers."

Although that is a bit unsatisfying because its specific example refers
to a multiple "risers", I think it still helps.

I would ask yourself: Is there a single physical location in the current
design with an exhaust volume that is at least 75% of the design outside
air flow?

Hope that helps.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] AHSRAE 90.1, Appendix G Question

I have a question about ASHRAE 90.1-2004, Appendix G.

I'm performing an energy model of a building that has a animal holding
(vivarium) facility within it.  The vivarium is served by its own air
handling unit, and the unit is 100% outside air.  Now, our proposed
design is not going to have any exhaust air energy recovery for this
vivarium air handling unit.

Based on Appendix G, I don't think I need to model the baseline building
with any heat recovery based on exception G3.1.2.10.f.  Am I correct in
assuming this?  This exception seems odd to me. Because my vivarium area
has a lot of exhaust sources (many exhaust diffusers) it would appear
that almost all 100% outside air units would meet this criteria.

In addition, I cannot utilize Exception G3.1.2.10.b to remove the energy
recovery from my vivarium air handling units.  Vivarium exhaust is not
considered toxic.

Does anyone disagree with my reasoning?

Thanks,

Dear All,
 
I am trying to model a building with Ground source heat pump system

 Is there any solution within eQUEST to model GSHP and regular Fancoil

Any suggestion or guilde is appreciated.

Hello everyone,

I am a student of Building Design at ASU. I am initiating a research on
buildings that have been known to cause problems of glare or excessive solar
reflection to either neighboring properties (other buildings, vehicles on
roads, people on streets etc.) or even parts of their own structure. For
example, the Disney Concert Hall by Gehry. This is not an exercise to
identify only famous examples that created problems. The purpose of my
research is to enable prediction and analysis of such glare/reflection (at
design stage and later) and then to mitigate its' impact.

I would appreciate members here giving me examples of such buildings that
caused glare/reflection issues. Any other thoughts on this subject are
welcome too. Thank you for your interest and time.

Brandon:
 
As promised, I post following instruction for obtaining the heat pump library. 
 
The heat pump library and other associated files for eQUEST to access the library are packaged in a self-extracted zip file, which can be downloaded at  <http://www.climatemaster.com/index/equest> http://www.climatemaster.com/index/equest after proper registration. In addition to the heat pump library, the standard release of eQUEST 3.6 and an eQUEST training handout focused on the enhanced GSHP simulation and the heat pump library can also to downloaded. In order to access the heat pump library directly from eQUEST wizard, the self-extracted zip file has to be unzipped over the installation of eQUEST. The instruction for unzipping the file is shown in the above web page. The procedure for selecting a heat pump from the library is described in slides 77-84 of the training handout. 
 
As an add-on feature, the heat pump library can be accessed by eQUEST starting from version 3.6.  
 
When you register, please make sure mentioning "RE: [BLDG-SIM] Trouble with Heat Pumps (eQuest)" in the text box for comment. Since the downloading request is still handled manually, it may take a few days for us to verify your registration and send you a link for downloading.
 
Hope it could be a small help for your simulation.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Trouble with Heat Pumps (eQuest)


Karen:
 
If you create a heat pump system using eQUEST wizard, in the first screen of the wizard system (after you specifying both cooling and heating equipment as "DX Coil"), an additional input entry will appear and ask you specify the source of the heat pump. The available options include "Air", "Water Loop", and "Ground Loop". When "Water Loop" is selected, the HVAC system will be defined a water loop heat pump (WLHP) system (with boiler and cooling tower); When "Ground Loop" is selected, the HVAC system will be defined as a ground source heat pump (GSHP) system that uses water-to-air heat pumps connected to a common (water) loop and a vertical borehole field as heat sink and source.
 
I'm not clear why you have to deal with HIR for WLHP and GSHP systems since these heat pumps are electric-driven. I guess you were talking about the EIR instead of HIR.
 
The PVVT is used to simulate the air side of a water-to-air heat pump so that it can account for the recent developments of water-to-air heat pump, such as the usage of staged compressor, variable speed fan, etc. If the WLHP/GSHP is created with the eQUEST wizard, parameters associated with the PVVT system will be automatically set for constant air flow, and default WLHP/GSHP heat pump performance curves will be used. The default curves are normalized at the ARI rating conditions for "ground loop" application (77F EFT for cooling and 32F EFT for heating). If the WSHP/GSHP is created in detailed mode, at this version of eQUEST, the user has to adjust the parameters of PVVT to fit for the specific heat pumps being simulated. I've listed some necessary adjustments for the parameters of PVVT in my earlier post to the topic "Gshp in detailed edit mode".
 
FYI, a performance data/curve library for all the water-to-air heat pumps of a major water-source heat pump manufacturer has been built and, as an add-on feature of eQUEST, it can be accessed directly from the wizard of "Packaged Equipment" if either WLHP or GSHP is specified. Please let me know if you are interested in the library and this add-on feature.
 
Hope it helps in your simulation.

Thanks for all the responses.  I think I figured it out:
 
When you choose "WLHP" in the eQuest Wizard, it creates a PVVT system with a GSHP.  The curve used to adjust HIR is based on a few data points, and did not perform very well at the temperatures I was using.  A straight HP system selected in detailed edit mode did much better.  I now realize that this is because the HIR curve was better for my purposes.  I have now created curves based on the heat pumps spec'd for this job and the numbers are making more sense. 
 
Thanks again for all the repsonses, thought I'd let everyone know, especially because PVVT is what is selected when you create a WLHP system with the wizard, and may need some detailed data edit tweaking.

Hello Karen,

Have you adjusted your heat pomp efficiencies?  Ground and water source heat pumps will have different efficiencies, if for no other reason than they are operating with different condenser water temperatures.

I apologize for all the emails I've sent out as of late.  Thanks for all the input.
 
I have another:
 
I'm comparing a ground source heat pump to a heat pump loop with chiller and boiler.  Trouble is, when I switch systems, the energy used by the heat pump to heat the space goes down only slightly as compared to the energy input by the boiler.  My loop temperatures change between the systems (from heating temp of 40 F to 70 F), and COP rises accordingly.  Right now the energy use of the two systems is off by about 85%!! 
 
Energy use for straight electric resistance heat is about the same as the electric use for a heat pump system.  This is for a baseline model with 18% evenly distributed windows, R-19 batt insulation, R-38 ceilings, etc. 
 
I used the wizard to set up the equipment for all runs (I'm also having trouble in detailed edit mode).  The water loop and the heat pump don't seem to be talking to one another.  Can anyone help?
 
Thanks,

Another area to check is night time setback. If for example you setback
too far and have to throttle back in the morning without cycling on
early enough that could be a problem. Also - make sure your fan schedule
matches your heating/cooling schedule - if you ramp up at 6:00 am, but
the fans don't come on till 8:00 am, the loads will be unmet in those 2
hours. Also, if you have multiple zones attached to the same system, and
your control zone is significantly smaller than the other ones, you
might have unmet loads.

I suggest you look at your peak building loads for the zones that cannot
be met and look for anything unusual.

One thing to look for is loads from underground surfaces on zones where
they don't belong.  

I have run across a problem where a model was built in the wizard with
underground floors mistakenly included on every shell rather than just
the ground floor.  eQuest, for whatever reason, does not handle this
well and has trouble satsifying the zone loads regardless of the system
capacity.

Do you have night purge running or AHUs cycling on night setback? If so
some (possibly all) systems reports include these hours in  
addition to the normal occupied hours you are really interested in.   
I always have to go back and refresh my memory on this stuff, but I know
for sure the SS-R report reports these additional hours as under- cooled
or under-heated where relevant.

If that doesn't explain things then there could be all kinds of other
explanations such as cooling equipment scheduled as unavailable, supply
temperature scheduled rather than demand reset etc.  Hourly reports of
offending days showing what all the equipment and temperatures are doing
will no doubt identify where you need to look ...

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200708151457.AA5721937pd80001473729@gard.com>

Hello all,
 
I am having difficulties modeling the temperature control side of an
underfloor air system.  Air is to enter the zones at 63 degF.  Supply
air is passed through a cooling coil set to provide 55 degF air (for
humidity control).  A portion of the air bypasses the cooling coil and
mixes with the 55 degF air in order to achieve the 63 degF SAT.  Is it
possible to control the coil leaving temperature while also maintaining
the zone entering SAT?
 
I do know that the 'Zone Entering Min Supply Temp' specified in eQuest
is used to calculated the design supply air flow rate and that the 'Coil
Design Bypass Factor' is a max setpoint for the system.  Hourly Reports
of zone temperature, cooling coil leaving temperature, and return air
temperature suggest that the 63degF supply air is not achieved.   Does
anyone have experience with this?

When choosing which release of eQUEST to download from the DOE2.com site 
you should rely on the information contained on the eQUEST web page 
(http://doe2.com/eQUEST/) or the version number included in the name of 
the install file.  You should put very little weight on the date listed 
for the file when viewing the eQUEST download area.  The date listed 
there generally corresponds to the date in which that file was last 
POSTED to the download area and not the date in which that installation 
was first created.  Having not posted this file to the download area 
myself I cannot say for sure why it was posted on 8/10/07, but my guess 
is that it was copied back into the download area by one of the persons 
on our development team to accommodate a user that required access to 
that particular release.
Another possible reason for an inconsistency between version numbering 
and file dates is situations where we are required to update certain 
versions in order to achieve some sort of certification - the latest 
example being when we posted a revised v3.6 to the site in March 2007 
following the posting of version 3.61 and 3.61b in October 2006.  In 
this case the CEC required certain changes to v3.6 in order to achieve 
certification to perform compliance analysis for California's Title-24 
energy code.  The changes that went into the updated v3.6 posting only 
affect users using eQUEST to perform Title-24 analysis.  You will 
generally find cases like this one explained on the eQUEST web page.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200708142226.AA2633343pd80001473048@gard.com>

Thanks for the suggestions from all of you!

Now the problem is that the building is surrounded by several buildings (in
downtown), one facade only about 10 feet to another building in distance.
Should I model the shading effect of these buildings in the baseline? If I
should, How the rotation excercise will be?

Thanks,

Ying Zhao

Do you have night purge running or AHUs cycling on night setback? If  
so some (possibly all) systems reports include these hours in  
addition to the normal occupied hours you are really interested in.   
I always have to go back and refresh my memory on this stuff, but I  
know for sure the SS-R report reports these additional hours as under- 
cooled or under-heated where relevant.

If that doesn't explain things then there could be all kinds of other  
explanations such as cooling equipment scheduled as unavailable,  
supply temperature scheduled rather than demand reset etc.  Hourly  
reports of offending days showing what all the equipment and  
temperatures are doing will no doubt identify where you need to look ...

Regards,
Graham

Hi David,

The fix is quite easy.

In the first page of the design development wizard for the building shell
(General Shell Information).  You can position the shell within the site
"Shell Location Within Site."  You can either opt to locate the shell
immediately above or below a reference shell, or check the box labeled
"specify exact site coordinates."

I usually create an autocad file that has all of my buildings drawn in their
correct locations.  I break the building (or buildings) down into shells for
easy modeling and trace them in the eQuest wizard.  I specify the exact site
location with X=0, Y=0 and change only Z to match the height of the
particular floor.

Hope this helps!

~Karen~

I am new to this listserve so excuse me if my answer has been posted.

I am looking for a database of minimum equipment efficiencies for receptacle loads, for accurate eQuest simulation reporting. This is specifically for checking accuracy of LEED baseline models, via ASHRAE 90.1 - 2004.

Thank you,

  I use imported autocad file to trace the the footprint shape in different floors. However, I found that in my model the shell always offset some obvious distance from one shell to another. But in the autocad file, differetn layers have the same original point.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Utility Load Data breakdown

I'm working on a retrofit project looking into ice storage.  We have
their utility data and can obtain some weather data.  I have heard of
programs that have been able to break down utility data to give a good
estimate of the components such as lighting, cooling, etc.  I'm
specifically interested in the cooling load and obtaining a good
estimate of the load profile throughout the day to understand the
benefits of peak load shifting.  Let me know if you know of any such
program.

Yes, I did changed individual zone capacity, and it is the cooling loads in
the
internal zones cannot be met.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200708131603.AA0339562pd80001472068@gard.com>

I would like to have all the IBPSA News items in hand by 24 September for
the October 2007 issue.  In this issue, I would like to emphasize the
results of BS2007 in Beijing and report on updates in commonly recognized
simulation software packages, as well as some lesser known software
packages.  
 
For those of you planning to attend BS2007 in Beijing, 3-6 September, (see:
www.BS2007.org.cn), please plan to take some photos and contribute them to
this next  issue of the IBPSA News.  For simulation software updates, it
would be good to have reports of new version numbers, new capabilities,
qualifications/certifications for energy tax credits, federal energy code
compliance, etc.  Visual and/or drawing interfaces would also be good to
read about.
 
As always, we are looking for announcements about your Affiliate activities
- several Affiliates are new this year - as well as conferences, meeting
reports, achievements, and honors and awards given to your members.
Photographs (JPEGs) are highly desirable and encouraged.
 
Scholarly articles are also welcome; though, we will be featuring one or two
from the BS conference.
 
Thank you for anything you can send.  Please remember that our editor can
work easier with DOC files rather than PDF files.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] (Fwd) Architecture As a Second Language -- Effective collaboration between architects and engineers

BLDG-SIM,

Recently, Kathy Bash of DMS Architects gave a presentation 
to BSUG titled "Architecture As a Second Language -- 
collaboration between architects and engineers" that I 
thought many of you would find interesting. I have posted a 
copy of the presentation at:

http://www.gard.com/ml/ASL.pdf

Below is Tom White's original posting about it. 

Please take a look at it and let me know what you think.

Thanks,

Jason

Greetings BSUGgers:

We have just posted the handout for Kathy Bash's BSUG 
presentation: "Architecture As a Second Language -- 
Effective collaboration between architects and engineers"  

To retrieve a copy, point your Internet browser to:

http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/BSUG/files/

and download the file under the 070718 - BSUG July 2007
folder.

You might find Kathy's presentation especially interesting.
A few highlights include:

- A graph of six variables showing Napoleon's march to 
Moscow and how the Grand Arm?e  of 500,000 soldiers was 
decimated piecemeal by the Russians and the winter before 
their return.  

- When a pie chart makes sense and a table can be 
invaluable.  

- A new take on the definitions of the standard 
construction phases of programming, SD, DD, and CD 
(reminiscent of Mike Hatten's integrated design language).  

- An overview of simplified design tools, like Google's 
SketchUp, and when they make sense to use.  

- There are three languages in a project: architect-speak, 
engineering-speak, and owner-speak. Owner-speak is the 
language of decision-making.  

- What if designing buildings were top-down instead of 
bottom up? Code is bottom-up: setting minimum threshold 
criteria. But top-down would be to set a standard or target 
for a sustainable design, then see whether you could meet 
or exceed the target.  

How are all these points related? You'll just have to get 
Kathy's presentation to find out.

We are planning multiple webcasts in the fall to cover various topics
that would be covered in the workshop.  The advantage of the workshop is
that you get hands-on experience using EnergyPlus -- with on-site help
working through issues.

I would be more than happy to participate in any web based training that

the class indicated below, I wonder what information as far as training
guides and presentations as well as video from this workshop could be
made available to the public for future use or possible web casting.

 

Our offices have not taken on EnergyPlus like we have IES <VE>, eQuest

interface for geometry that Designbuilder has to offer.  At this point
flipping through the 2000+ page help guides has been less than desirable
for me, but I am willing to except it should it be my only option.

I'm working on a retrofit project looking into ice storage.  We have
their utility data and can obtain some weather data.  I have heard of
programs that have been able to break down utility data to give a good
estimate of the components such as lighting, cooling, etc.  I'm
specifically interested in the cooling load and obtaining a good
estimate of the load profile throughout the day to understand the
benefits of peak load shifting.  Let me know if you know of any such
program.

Brandon,
 
We just implemented, in ESP-r, an upgraded boiler model that accepts a
series of coefficients to represent a complex curve fit involving both
return water temperature and firing rate, which are the key parameters
determining condensing boiler efficiency.  The coefficents for the model
equation are generated using an Excel spreadsheet calculator, with data
input exactly like what is in the graph in your ELCCA post.  In our
modelling scheme we allow for outdoor air compensation acting directly
on the boiler flow temperature setpoint (aquastat setting) both for
on-off and modulating versions of the boiler model.  Other than that, it
is just our two node boiler model for the dynamic part.  More info on
this is contained in a project report at
http://www.sesg.strath.ac.uk/Downloads/Report_BRE_E302_040707.pdf (look
at P6).
 
Hope this is of interest.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Condensing Boiler Curve HIR



All,
 
Some time ago I began developing this post
<http://elcca-exchange.blogspot.com/2006/12/equest-boiler-curve-example.
html>  describing the derivation of a condensing boiler HIR performance
curve based on boiler supply and return water temperature.
 
By popular request and the requirements of a current project, I now have
the incentive to actually try implementing it.  
 
This has turned out to be not as simple as I would've expected, when
using the HIR-FT performance curve in the parametric run, there is no
change from the baseline case with a constant 1.25 HIR.  A couple of
things I noticed that might be contributing to the problem:
 
* While the built-in performance curve HIR-FT function implies on the
eQuest dialog box that it is a function of boiler EWT and LWT, the
DOCUMENTATION states that the lesser parameter is supplied by either the
zone temperature or the outdoor temperature, depending on the value of
the LOCATION keyword.  Is HIR-FT a function of boiler return water
temperature (i.e. EWT) or not?
 
* It is impossible to set via the dialog box the HIR-FPLR to 'undefined'
in the baseline case; when 'undefined' is selected,
'Atmospheric-Blr-HIR-fPLR' jumps back as the default on leaving the
dialogue.  Could this performance curve be overriding the the HIR-FT
performance curve?
 
* While it should be trivial for someone more familiar with BDL to
simply define a keyword expression (or input macro or function... hmm,
which one?) to compute the HIR based on EWT and LWT, however I do not
know which approach to take (expression, macro, or function) and could
not find a reference in the DOE2.2 documentation for accessing
dynamically changing parameters, specifically either the boiler or
circulation loop supply and return temperatures.
 
* Lastly, I have specified the loop supply temperature to vary based on
an OSA reset schedule, but in the case of the condensing boiler I would
also like the boiler aquastat setpoint to be reset (this presumably will
reset the temperature of the boiler LWT).  A similar problem to the HIR
function, but perhaps simpler would be to make the aquastat setpoint
track exactly with the loop supply temp, which is being reset as
expected.  How can AQUASTAT-SETPT-T be set to equal the dynamically
changing value of the circulation loop setpoint? 
 
 
Thanks in advance...

zone temperature or the outdoor temperature, depending on the value of
the LOCATION keyword.  Is HIR-FT a function of boiler return water
temperature (i.e. EWT) or not?
 
* It is impossible to set via the dialog box the HIR-FPLR to 'undefined'
in the baseline case; when 'undefined' is selected,
'Atmospheric-Blr-HIR-fPLR' jumps back as the default on leaving the
dialogue.  Could this performance curve be overriding the the HIR-FT
performance curve?
 
* While it should be trivial for someone more familiar with BDL to
simply define a keyword expression (or input macro or function... hmm,
which one?) to compute the HIR based on EWT and LWT, however I do not
know which approach to take (expression, macro, or function) and could
not find a reference in the DOE2.2 documentation for accessing
dynamically changing parameters, specifically either the boiler or
circulation loop supply and return temperatures.
 
* Lastly, I have specified the loop supply temperature to vary based on
an OSA reset schedule, but in the case of the condensing boiler I would
also like the boiler aquastat setpoint to be reset (this presumably will
reset the temperature of the boiler LWT).  A similar problem to the HIR
function, but perhaps simpler would be to make the aquastat setpoint
track exactly with the loop supply temp, which is being reset as
expected.  How can AQUASTAT-SETPT-T be set to equal the dynamically
changing value of the circulation loop setpoint? 
 
 
Thanks in advance...

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200708101357.AA5702109pd80001470741@gard.com>

Hello all,

 

I have seen several posts come across asking which program to use to model
the Variable Refrigerant Volume system, but I am wondering if anyone has
tried to use Trace700 to do so.  I am coming up with results showing the new
VRV system is using more energy than the old system consisting of one window
AC unit (PTAC) and one electric baseboard heater per room (hotel room in
this case).  The baseline and design models are identical except for the
system type and I have checked that the heating and cooling loads for the
each are the same.

 

I checked with the program manufacturer (Trane) and it looks like I have the
correct inputs under the Create Systems and Create Plants tabs for the VRV
system.  I do not know if the unusual results are coming from the baseline
PTAC system or the design VRV system.  Does anyone have any advice on what
variables to check in either system?  I know that is a broad question and I
can provide specifics if needed.  This is the first time I have attempted to
use Trace700 for an energy model.  

 


Thanks in advance.

Good afternoon Robert,
 
Make sure you name your report something easy to remember.  Then, when
you open the .sim file, use the search/find feature with your report
name as the keyword.  Another way I search for the report, and also
within the report, is to use the search on day and time basis, example
"123124" gives me the end of the report at December 31, hour 24.  When
using the date/hour format, remember that there is usually an hourly
report already defaulted by eQuest in the .sim file, and if using a
global block, the global parameter may be listed separately for the
entire hourly schedule before your full report shows up.
 
Good luck and have a nice weekend.

This is a fundamental issue with solar thermal systems. Getting above 50, 60,70% contribution gets very hard for space heating, and/or systems combined with DHW. This is because the last few % are in the coldest months with little solar. Hence, the decrease in annual contribution as you add panels. The same is not true for DHW because of the flatter monthly load.

Hi (again),

I'm sizing some solar hot water panels for a project (solar heat for an indoor pool).  When choosing the number of panels, I discovered something curious:

After I get up to about 65% solar energy for the system, the efficiency of adding new panels drops off.  For example, the first panel provides 2.66 MBtu, but the 33rd only 2.00 MBtu.  Is this because I've reached the point where the panels are too big for the load some of the time??  I assume this could be improved by adding thermal storage.

Thanks,

A very good question!  I have actually been getting yelled at and
threatened by clients (we won't hire you again) because eQUEST is not on
the list and they can't get the tax credit based on the models I am
doing.

 

I received an email from Jeff Hirsh several months ago indicating it
would be on the list in 1-2 months.

Chris,
 
If you go for the Tenant Guideline credit in LEED CS and you include occupancy sensors, daylight sensors, and/or W/sf for lighting fixtures in the Tenant Guidelines you can achieve the lighting efficiency savings for EAc1. We have done this for a project in the past and it has been accepted by the USGBC.

Hi (again),

I'm sizing some solar hot water panels for a project (solar heat for an
indoor pool).  When choosing the number of panels, I discovered something
curious:

After I get up to about 65% solar energy for the system, the efficiency of
adding new panels drops off.  For example, the first panel provides
2.66MBtu, but the 33rd only
2.00 MBtu.  Is this because I've reached the point where the panels are too
big for the load some of the time??  I assume this could be improved by
adding thermal storage.

Thanks,

LEED C&S specifies that proposed and baseline lighting in tenant spaces
should be identical because lighting design for these spaces is usually
done as part of the tenant fit-out. You generally cannot take credit for
occupancy sensors in these spaces either, and for the same reason.
However, if the tenant space lighting is specified then I think you have
to model the lighting load in the proposed design case as it is shown on
the drawings and take the penalty for the higher than 90.1-2004 LPDs.

Karen:
 
If you create a heat pump system using eQUEST wizard, in the first
screen of the wizard system (after you specifying both cooling and
heating equipment as "DX Coil"), an additional input entry will appear
and ask you specify the source of the heat pump. The available options
include "Air", "Water Loop", and "Ground Loop". When "Water Loop" is
selected, the HVAC system will be defined a water loop heat pump (WLHP)
system (with boiler and cooling tower); When "Ground Loop" is selected,
the HVAC system will be defined as a ground source heat pump (GSHP)
system that uses water-to-air heat pumps connected to a common (water)
loop and a vertical borehole field as heat sink and source.
 
I'm not clear why you have to deal with HIR for WLHP and GSHP systems
since these heat pumps are electric-driven. I guess you were talking
about the EIR instead of HIR.
 
The PVVT is used to simulate the air side of a water-to-air heat pump so
that it can account for the recent developments of water-to-air heat
pump, such as the usage of staged compressor, variable speed fan, etc.
If the WLHP/GSHP is created with the eQUEST wizard, parameters
associated with the PVVT system will be automatically set for constant
air flow, and default WLHP/GSHP heat pump performance curves will be
used. The default curves are normalized at the ARI rating conditions for
"ground loop" application (77F EFT for cooling and 32F EFT for heating).
If the WSHP/GSHP is created in detailed mode, at this version of eQUEST,
the user has to adjust the parameters of PVVT to fit for the specific
heat pumps being simulated. I've listed some necessary adjustments for
the parameters of PVVT in my earlier post to the topic "Gshp in detailed
edit mode".
 
FYI, a performance data/curve library for all the water-to-air heat
pumps of a major water-source heat pump manufacturer has been built and,
as an add-on feature of eQUEST, it can be accessed directly from the
wizard of "Packaged Equipment" if either WLHP or GSHP is specified.
Please let me know if you are interested in the library and this add-on
feature.
 
Hope it helps in your simulation.
 
Xiaobing

	Thanks for all the responses.  I think I figured it out:
	 
	When you choose "WLHP" in the eQuest Wizard, it creates a PVVT
system with a GSHP.  The curve used to adjust HIR is based on a few data
points, and did not perform very well at the temperatures I was using.
A straight HP system selected in detailed edit mode did much better.  I
now realize that this is because the HIR curve was better for my
purposes.  I have now created curves based on the heat pumps spec'd for
this job and the numbers are making more sense. 
	 
	Thanks again for all the repsonses, thought I'd let everyone
know, especially because PVVT is what is selected when you create a WLHP
system with the wizard, and may need some detailed data edit tweaking.

		I apologize for all the emails I've sent out as of late.
Thanks for all the input.
		 
		I have another:
		 
		I'm comparing a ground source heat pump to a heat pump
loop with chiller and boiler.  Trouble is, when I switch systems, the
energy used by the heat pump to heat the space goes down only slightly
as compared to the energy input by the boiler.  My loop temperatures
change between the systems (from heating temp of 40 F to 70 F), and COP
rises accordingly.  Right now the energy use of the two systems is off
by about 85%!! 
		 
		Energy use for straight electric resistance heat is
about the same as the electric use for a heat pump system.  This is for
a baseline model with 18% evenly distributed windows, R-19 batt
insulation, R-38 ceilings, etc. 
		 
		I used the wizard to set up the equipment for all runs
(I'm also having trouble in detailed edit mode).  The water loop and the
heat pump don't seem to be talking to one another.  Can anyone help?
		 
		Thanks,

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200708070335.AA3556562pd80001468009@gard.com>

Dear all

I recently notice that the lighting or euqipment schedule for every month is
same , but the monthly electricity use for lignting or equipment is quite
different. And I didn't turn on  daylighing during the simulation.It make me
confused. By the way the result is come form Equest. Have anyone ever notice
that and can you give me some explanation for this. I will very appreciate
for your help.

Karen:
 
If you create a heat pump system using eQUEST wizard, in the first screen of the wizard system (after you specifying both cooling and heating equipment as "DX Coil"), an additional input entry will appear and ask you specify the source of the heat pump. The available options include "Air", "Water Loop", and "Ground Loop". When "Water Loop" is selected, the HVAC system will be defined a water loop heat pump (WLHP) system (with boiler and cooling tower); When "Ground Loop" is selected, the HVAC system will be defined as a ground source heat pump (GSHP) system that uses water-to-air heat pumps connected to a common (water) loop and a vertical borehole field as heat sink and source.
 
I'm not clear why you have to deal with HIR for WLHP and GSHP systems since these heat pumps are electric-driven. I guess you were talking about the EIR instead of HIR.
 
The PVVT is used to simulate the air side of a water-to-air heat pump so that it can account for the recent developments of water-to-air heat pump, such as the usage of staged compressor, variable speed fan, etc. If the WLHP/GSHP is created with the eQUEST wizard, parameters associated with the PVVT system will be automatically set for constant air flow, and default WLHP/GSHP heat pump performance curves will be used. The default curves are normalized at the ARI rating conditions for "ground loop" application (77F EFT for cooling and 32F EFT for heating). If the WSHP/GSHP is created in detailed mode, at this version of eQUEST, the user has to adjust the parameters of PVVT to fit for the specific heat pumps being simulated. I've listed some necessary adjustments for the parameters of PVVT in my earlier post to the topic "Gshp in detailed edit mode".
 
FYI, a performance data/curve library for all the water-to-air heat pumps of a major water-source heat pump manufacturer has been built and, as an add-on feature of eQUEST, it can be accessed directly from the wizard of "Packaged Equipment" if either WLHP or GSHP is specified. Please let me know if you are interested in the library and this add-on feature.
 
Hope it helps in your simulation.
 
Xiaobing

Thanks for all the responses.  I think I figured it out:
 
When you choose "WLHP" in the eQuest Wizard, it creates a PVVT system with a GSHP.  The curve used to adjust HIR is based on a few data points, and did not perform very well at the temperatures I was using.  A straight HP system selected in detailed edit mode did much better.  I now realize that this is because the HIR curve was better for my purposes.  I have now created curves based on the heat pumps spec'd for this job and the numbers are making more sense. 
 
Thanks again for all the repsonses, thought I'd let everyone know, especially because PVVT is what is selected when you create a WLHP system with the wizard, and may need some detailed data edit tweaking.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200708061517.AA1757390pd80001467639@gard.com>

Here is what you need to do when adding a partial roof to a space:

*	Create a copy of the polygon of the space you want a roof over. You can find out what polygon it is by finding the space and clicking "properties." The polygon should be listed there.
*	Create a new exterior wall for that space by right clicking on the space and selecting "create exterior wall." In the details for that wall, make the location "Top" and attach it to that polygon you just created.
*	Find the polygon in the edit tree on the left and double click on it. You will see the vertices of the polygon. Now you can erase some of the points or add some if needed. By hitting "Tab" after entering each point, it will update the polygon and you can see what your roof shape looks like.

This is a tedious task, but it is the only way you can make a partial roof.
 
Hope this helps.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] eQUEST- adding a roof


Greetings,
I am modeling a building with a different footprint for the 1st and 2nd stories, so I imported the CAD drawings in as 2 different shells and managed to make it all of the way into detailed mode before noticing the first floor is entirely covered by an exterior roof.  So, I deleted the 1st flr exterior roof, but I still need this roof in certain areas b/c the first floor protrudes beyond the 2nd flr in a few spots and the 1st floor roof serves as a porch floor for the second story.  I added an 'external wall' child component for those spaces and copied the existing roof's characteristics.  Unfortunately, it is showing up as pure white as if nothing is there and I can't figure out why or if eQUEST is recognizing it as a roof or if it is recognizing this area as a hole.  Any experience with this? 
 
I changed the properties tab to exactly match the 2nd story roof including answering 'yes' for shading surface.   
Any insight would be greatly appreciated!
Thanks!
Kathryn

Hi Kathryn,

There are two ways to do this.  First, you can split the first floor into
two shells in the wizard, one which has an exterior roof, and the other
which is under the second floor.  You can then adjust the ceiling and roof
properties accordingly and have the computer figure everything out (this
also works well for walk-out basements where most of the basement is
underground, but a few rooms have external walls.

The other option is to modify properties in the detailed edit mode.  You can
copy existing roofs, making sure that you put them in the correct rooms and
assign them the right geometries, this way you are sure that they have the
right properties.  Sometimes the angle of the wall will affect the way it
looks on the screen.  Also, sometimes when you create a new surface before
deleting the old surface (the old interior ceiling), all you can see is the
interior ceiling.

Hope this helps.

~Karen~

Kathryn -
 
As a mattter of fact, I have had a very similar experience. Were you
careful in positioning the new roof (correct vertices, tilt, facing
direction, etc) to ensure it is positioned where you want it? You can
check to see if it's in the model by viewing the wireframe 3D model and
highlighting the subject roof in the components list (if it's not in the
components list, it's not in the model). eQuest's interpretation of your
intent should show up outlined in red. Even if it's located somewhere
between the 1st & 2nd floors, it should still model the roof properly
(except for the shading - both what it shades and what shades it) as
long as it is specified as an outside wall component with the correct
tilt and is associated with the appropriate space. If that space is a
plenum that can be considered open throughout, you could break the
plenum into multiple spaces, matching one to each area that has an
exposed roof, and put a roof on each such space. Interior air walls can
be used to effectively connect the plenums thermally if you feel that
would be important, however, I'm not sure whether that may hamper plenum
HVAC returns. I used the latter approach when modeling a non-orthogonal
building with different footprints on each floor - it seemed to work.
 
Hope this helps.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] eQUEST- adding a roof
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200708061408.AA0801687pd80001467398@gard.com>

Greetings,
I am modeling a building with a different footprint for the 1st and 2nd
stories, so I imported the CAD drawings in as 2 different shells and managed
to make it all of the way into detailed mode before noticing the first
floor is entirely covered by an exterior roof.  So, I deleted the 1st flr
exterior roof, but I still need this roof in certain areas b/c the first
floor protrudes beyond the 2nd flr in a few spots and the 1st floor
roof serves as a porch floor for the second story.  I added an 'external
wall' child component for those spaces and copied the existing roof's
characteristics.  Unfortunately, it is showing up as pure white as
if nothing is there and I can't figure out why or if eQUEST is recognizing
it as a roof or if it is recognizing this area as a hole.  Any experience
with this?

I changed the properties tab to exactly match the 2nd story roof
including answering 'yes' for shading surface.
Any insight would be greatly appreciated!
Thanks!
Kathryn

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200708031928.AA2831156pd80001466743@gard.com>

I apologize for all the emails I've sent out as of late.  Thanks for all the
input.

I have another:

I'm comparing a ground source heat pump to a heat pump loop with chiller and
boiler.  Trouble is, when I switch systems, the energy used by the heat pump
to heat the space goes down only slightly as compared to the energy input by
the boiler.  My loop temperatures change between the systems (from heating
temp of 40 F to 70 F), and COP rises accordingly.  Right now the energy use
of the two systems is off by about 85%!!

Energy use for straight electric resistance heat is about the same as the
electric use for a heat pump system.  This is for a baseline model with 18%
evenly distributed windows, R-19 batt insulation, R-38 ceilings, etc.

I used the wizard to set up the equipment for all runs (I'm also having
trouble in detailed edit mode).  The water loop and the heat pump don't seem
to be talking to one another.  Can anyone help?

Thanks,

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Introduction and Load Calculation Survey
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200708030751.AA5113937pd80001466281@gard.com>

Hi, I've recently subscribed to this list.  Perhaps I should introduce
myself briefly:  I'm based in the UK working within the concept design
and sustainability team of a building services engineering consultancy.
I use TAS as my main tool for thermal simulation.  I've also been using
Ecotect, Radiance and Daysim for solar & daylight analysis.  Hopefully
this list can help me keep up to date with current practice in the
industry as well as the academic world.

Recently I've been involved with some research into the calculation of
cooling and heating loads.  I'm concerned about the environmental and
economic implications that different calculation methods have.  For
example, uncertainly in a tool's accuracy (or the user's ability to
define the building and make appropriate assumptions) may lead to use of
excessive safety margins and oversized plant.

At this stage I'm particularly interested in identifying current
practice among UK building services engineers, as opposed to simulation
specialists, so I appreciate that this list may not be the most
appropriate place for my question.  If you know of any other discussion
lists or colleagues who would be able to answer these questions it would
be a great help if you could forward the survey on to them.

Load Calculation Survey

I'm investigating the current practice with respect to heating and
cooling load calculations.  I'd be very grateful if you could help me by
answering the following question:

What methods do you use, on a regular basis, to calculate loads for
plant sizing?

1) Manual/spreadsheet admittance calculation
2) CIBSE based design package (Cymap/Hevacomp)
3) Thermal simulation software (TAS/ApacheSim)
4) Published rules of thumb
5) Guesswork!
6) Other (please describe)

Thanks for your help!

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200708022006.AA0623531pd80001466111@gard.com>

The reverse of the CUP questions I guess...

Is there guidance for using Appendix G where a new addition will have a
chiller included, however the chiller will be sized to provide chilled
water for the new addition and also contribute to the chilled water load
of the existing building?

Would it be correct to use the design performance for the chiller but
only calculating the portion of the load that is included in the model?
i.e. develop my performance curves from the data provided, but the
modeled chiller will only be sized for the appropriate capacity for the
addition, excluding the existing facility?

Or should I treat the chiller as purchased chilled water?

In either case, the baseline building will have its own chiller plant,
per the standard.

Any suggestions are welcome!

David

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] IES<VE> Users
In-Reply-To: <MDAEMON-F200708020022.AA221800pd80003402264@gard.com>
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200708021942.AA420000pd80001466053@gard.com>

Having used iesVE for a just over a year now---still a relatively new user
of the tool, but one that has pushed it pretty hard along the way---the
following is an attempt to share a range of insights for those interested:
 
IES say they have put the simulation engine through the paces with the
various ASHRAE standard tests that Drury Crawley referred to; however, I've
not dug into the results of those tests specifically. I expect you could
obtain the results upon request.
 
My use of VE has been mainly for envelope performance, thermal, HVAC, and
natural ventilation simulations, plus some daylighting. This has included
modeling a range of less common strategies, such as double skins, actively
controlled openings, UFAD and displacement ventilation, and daylight
collectors. 
 
VE has allowed me to combine relative optimization of the building envelope
with radiant cooling (slab-integrated or panels) in various mechanical and
mixed-mode natural ventilation configurations in comparison to more
conventional approaches. These have included UFAD as well, wherein I've been
able to look at thermal decay in the underfloor plenum and radiant transfer
between the warm ceiling above and floor/plenum surface. VE's ability to
approximate double skins and stratified environments (essentially same as
COMIS), plus exceptional flexibility with regard to mixed-mode operation and
control of openings, were also significant benefits for in my work.
 
As part of my work at the CBE, I've also made some effort, though far from
exhaustive, to compare VE to other building simulation tools (note that I've
taken a fairly rough, spotty, apples & oranges approach and do not claim to
be an expert here). In this context I've been focused mainly on how various
tools handle or allow manipulation and control of parameters associated with
hydronic radiant cooling and bulk-airflow modeling across a range of
alternatives that include mechanical airside systems. While every tool has
pros and cons, my experience with VE is that it is overall the most useful,
flexible, and integrated set of tools for informing and developing design
alternatives, particularly for less conventional strategies that rely on the
building itself or an integrated systems approach more than mechanical
systems alone to achieve desired levels of indoor environmental quality. I
still use various supporting tools, such as LBNL's Window5 or specific tools
with Ecotect, plus other whole-building simulation tools, such as eQuest,
where they are better suited to particular problems. 
 
Some examples: 
 
Like eQuest, VE supports a progression of analysis from getting quick
answers in conceptual design to detailed analysis in DDs. While eQuest/DOE-2
has, without question, far more extensive capability for modeling a very
broad range of relatively conventional mechanical HVAC systems, my
experience has been that VE is much less constrained when it comes to
modeling various unconventional or building-integrated systems and has
considerably greater capability with regard to daylighting, natural
ventilation, etc. And, if your handy with juggling eQuest input files, you
can use eQuest to post-process VE results for certain mechanical elements,
such as water-side economizer operation. 
 
Similarly, it appears EnergyPlus may be more robust or accurate in certain
situations, though I've not yet come across this in my work. On the
contrary, many of the fundamental limitations I've found in VE, such as the
method for approximating view factors for radiant exchange, are essentially
the same in EnergyPlus. (Of course, there are surely relevant differences
I've not dealt with.) However, I have found some things I'd like to do, such
as controlled prioritization of hydronic cooling in a space using both
hydronic and air-side mechanical cooling, that can be readily done in VE
but, according to Rick Strand (who developed the radiant cooling module for
E+), are not presently possible in E+. I also prefer the degree to which VE
permits integrated analysis of natural ventilation (BAS-controlled or
otherwise). Finally, while the VE user interface still has a bit of a steep
learning curve and lots of room for improvement, it is quite workable and
currently well beyond the DesignBuilder interface for EnergyPlus (the best
E+ interface I'm aware of) in terms of providing a practical level of access
to the full range of simulation potential that the VE toolset offers. The
latter may be of value if you are looking for capability that is similar to
the combination of EnergyPlus, COMIS (or CONTAM), and Radiance, but with an
integrated user interface that is well suited to the pace and constraints of
design projects (as differentiated from research, for which one typically
has much more time). 
 
Similar comparisons can be made with TAS and TRNSYS. In the end, how you
intend to use the tool may be the most important determinant of which is
best for you.
 
My understanding is that the Revit plug-in, which takes the design process
integration one step further---porting geometry and building component
information directly from Revit into VE---is new enough that it works well
only for fairly simple stuff, but hopefully will improve in time. However,
my sense of these limitations is based only upon what I've heard and not
first-hand experience.
 
I have been impressed with the rate of development of VE and the
responsiveness of the IES technical staff. Rapid development of such a
complex tool definitely has both pros and cons: While some additional bugs
may missed before each new release, etc., in just over one year, the
development team has made exceptional progress and has added many
capabilities in direct response to user input. 
 
It may also be worth noting that a growing number of significant engineering
firms, such as the London offices of ARUP, Buro Happold, and KEEN
Engineering (now a part of Stantec), have come to rely on VE for many
projects. They might offer further insights.
 
Hopefully this has been helpful.

we just had one of the programmers in our office.  It looks pretty robust,
has a nice graphical interface and translator from our revit models, so for
us, that could save time.  Also, it has some good day lighting analysis
tools, so with the one model we can look at thermal performance and day
lighting.  that is intriguing.  that said, I haven't used it on a project

Yes, the building is going for LEED certification, therein lays my concern
for shading from existing buildings.  I had originally thought to make the
new construction walls butting against the existing building adiabatic but I
had not thought to make them interior.  Either way it still doesn't account
for shading on the new construction exterior walls.  I think I understand
that one can make custom shading devices but am unfamiliar with the process
so I will research.  Currently, my thought is to just include the existing
structures and leave them unconditioned and make the connecting new
construction walls adiabatic.  This way the shading will be accounted for.
I am wondering if it is expectable for LEEDs.  Or would it be easier to
create custom shading?

Again, thank you for your responses.

You could also construct the shape of the existing building with "fixed
shades". This would simulate the shading accurately without having to
construct the whole existing building. The walls in contact with the
existing building should be designated ADIABATIC as suggested in previous
emails.

Kevin,

 

I have interpreted the existing buildings to be perpendicular to the
addition.  If this is the case and the buildings at the ends of the addition
are large, they could produce significant shading on the addition
(especially if the exposed surfaces of the addition face north and south).
The problem is: how do you quantify this?  More than likely, you will have
to create a schedule to represent it if you don't model the whole building.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Building additions and shading

 

Kevin:

 

I am getting a bit old and slow, so I don't quite understand your questions.

 

If you are modeling a new construction rectangle that has both ends (say top
and bottom on a plan view) abutting existing structures, I believe you can
make these walls INTERIOR and ADIABATIC. In that way, you have no outside
influence on the wall, and no heat transfer to another space.

 

You WILL, however, need to make the changes in the .INP text file. You
simply cannot do it in the eQuest overlay.

 

Why do you care about shading from external sources. Just don't put those
sources In !!

 

Or have I missed something?

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Building additions and shading

Greetings, I am simulating a building that from bird's eye view looks like a
big rectangle.  Either end of the new construction is connected to existing
buildings.  Furthermore, it appears the first floor of the new construction
extends into a renovation of one of the pre-existing forms.  How does one
turn off shading on exterior surfaces?  Also, would it be better to modeling
the existing buildings as well?  The new construction will be running on its
own systems.

 

Thanks.

 

Kevin

Kathryn:

 

The modeling of a group of buildings, including the physical plant and
distribution system was discussed at length at the last 90.1 ECB meeting
at Long Beach, without conclusion. There are examples of how to do this
in the ASHARE literature, but probably not a consensus method as yet. 

 

Issues include defining the baseline, how to take measurements to
calibrate the simulation, where to take these measurements, etc. These
all depend on what the ECRMs are.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] EA Cr 1 campuses

 

We are modeling a group of six buildings for a university which will be
served by the current campus CUP's steam and chilled water loops.
These buildings will all be submitted for  LEED certification as one
project.  Does anyone know if we can model the baseline from ASHRAE
90.1-2004 Appendix G for each building according to its individual
square footage, or if we have to choose the baseline system based off of
the total square footage for the entire group of buildings?  For our
project this would mean the difference between 90.1's System 5 (DX
cooling) and System 7 (chilled water).    

I found this little excerpt from the LEED Application Guide for multiple
buildings and campuses, but feel it doesn't really directly tackle the
question of choosing the baseline system but could potentially be
interpretted to mean that each building is considered separately during
the modeling process and therefor would have a baseline system based off
of its own square footage: 

 

EA Credit 1: Optimize Energy Performance 

Application Guidance 

Requirements 

This credit applies to each building within the project scope. To
receive a single rating for a group of buildings, use a weighted average
for the group of buildings based on their conditioned square footage, or
aggregate the data into one PRM calculation, so that performance is
achieved by buildings of varying sizes within a certifying group. Each
building must still meet EA Prerequisite 1 and may receive its own
rating if that is desired. 

 

 Any experience with this?  Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.  

Thanks!

Thanks to those who responded, I found a solution to the "Pump Head" and
"CURINV" errors listed below.  I wanted to post the solution to the list, to
add to our knowledge-base.

Best,
Andy


*Error:*

 **WARNING**********************************************************************
             Pump: DHW Loop Pump                    has a user-specified

?repeats for hundreds of pages



*Solution:*

Directly editing the INP file:

$ ---------------------------------------------------------

$              Pumps

$ ---------------------------------------------------------



"DHW Loop Pump" = PUMP

   HEAD             = 7

   MOTOR-CLASS      = HI-EFF

   ..



*Comments:*

By increasing HEAD from "0.5" to "7", the error disappeared.  Impact on
simulated energy consumption was minimal, there was an increase in pump
consumption of 0.4 kWh/yr.

I'm using a RESET-RATIO schedule in an eQuest simulation for the first time,
and I'm not sure what some the inputs under the Day Schedules tab mean.
Specifically, I'm wondering about the two temperature and ratio inputs.  Are
there any typical values other than the defaults?

 

I'm using this schedule to control my HW baseboards.

Sure, pools have been "modeled"
in DOE-2.2/eQuest. But: 
 

  
 

The evaporation from the pool depends on
the temperature and moisture of air in the pool room which will depend on the
operation and setpoints of any HVAC alternatives. But in DOE-2, no feedback
exists. 
 

  
 

Furthermore, many of the interesting
options for dehumidification involve system configurations, and perhaps
controls, that are not represented by the program. (Wrap-around heat pipes,
etc., check the descriptions in the catalogs) 
 

  
 

For heat recovery in
 Vermont winters, be sure to turn
FROST-CONTROL on in the HR settings. And hope the program doesn't hang. 
 

  
 

I thought someone, in
 Canada perhaps, had a
single-purpose indoor pool program. Or there's TRNSYS.

in eQuest [mistake in 1st email] 
 




  
 

Oos.  That's 55 lbs/hr total, not per sf.

Hello All, 
 






  
 






Has anyone modeled a pool in eQuest?  I am modeling a space that
contains a 24 X 44 foot pool.  I'm estimating 55 lbs/hr of evaporation per
sf of surface area (for any period of time when the pool is uncoverd).  At
a minimum I need to model space dehumidification and the energy needed to heat
the pool and replacement water.  I checked the help files and am using a
reheat fan system, as suggested. 
 






  
 






I can simply input a latent load into the space to simmulate the
humidity, and manually calculate and input an energy load for pool heat, but
I'd like to do better. 
 






  
 






Thanks,

we just had one of the programmers in our office.  It looks pretty
robust, has a nice graphical interface and translator from our revit
models, so for us, that could save time.  Also, it has some good day
lighting analysis tools, so with the one model we can look at thermal
performance and day lighting.  that is intriguing.  that said, I haven't
used it on a project yet.

IES<VE> is one of the 20 energy simulation programs compared in a 2005
report:
http://www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/tools_directory/pdfs/contrasting_th
e_capabilities_of_building_energy_performance_simulation_programs_v1.0.p
df
 
Questions one should ask in looking at any energy simulation program:
1. How detailed are the engineering models of the HVAC systems?
2. Has the program been tested using ASHRAE Standard 140-2004 and other
validation/verification methods?
    a. If so, where are the results and input/output files?

Hi Kevin,

I am not sure if there is data specific to Potsdam, NY or what format 
that you are looking for, however here is one resources for datasets:

    http://www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/cfm/weather_data3.cfm/region=4_north_and_central_america_wmo_region_4/country=1_usa/cname=USA#NY

Perhaps you can use the closest dataset?

  You could also construct the shape of the existing building with "fixed  shades". This would simulate the shading accurately without having to  construct the whole existing building. The  walls in contact with the existing building should be designated  ADIABATIC as suggested in previous emails.

    I am getting a bit old and slow, so I don't quite understand your  questions.
     
    If you are modeling a new construction rectangle that has both  ends (say top and bottom on a plan view) abutting existing structures, I  believe you can make these walls INTERIOR and ADIABATIC. In that way, you have  no outside influence on the wall, and no heat transfer to another space.
     
    You WILL, however, need to make the changes in the .INP text file.  You simply cannot do it in the eQuest overlay.

I am guessing you want to model the buildings without shading for the
LEED base building. You can model the adjacent buildings as exterior
shades that mimic the building geometry. You can set the shade
transmittance and control the shading from that, or just reduce the
height to be near zero (I don't think you can actually use a zero value)
 
With regards to self shading, there are a few posts earlier on this list
serve that address that.
 
Hope this helps.
