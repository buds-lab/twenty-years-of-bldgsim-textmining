GeoPraxis Announces XML Schema for Building Energy and Environmental
Performance Analysis
------------------------------------------

SONOMA, Calif., May 2, 2000 / -- Today pioneering energy analysis solutions
provider GeoPraxis, Inc. announced the publication of an open XML schema
that will greatly facilitate the analysis of building energy and
environmental performance.  Soon architects, engineers, and others who
design and build buildings in CAD will be able to predict how much energy
their buildings will use and how much pollution they will produce with
drag-and-drop simplicity.

The new schema, Green Building XML (gbXML), will greatly simplify and
popularize the use of powerful but traditionally hard to use building energy
simulation software.  Presently this type of software is only used for
research or on the largest construction projects that can afford to hire
specially trained engineers.

The gbXML schema will facilitate the transfer of building information
including product characteristics and equipment performance data between
manufacturer?s databases, CAD applications, and energy simulation engines.
Improved data interoperability between the tools currently used in the
architecture, engineering, and construction (A/E/C) industry will greatly
reduce the time and cost of designing high performance, energy and resource
efficient buildings.

John Kennedy, head of software development at GeoPraxis, made the
announcement.  ?After six months of dedicated effort by our simulation tool
development team, the preliminary gbXML specification is now ready for
industry review and comment.  GeoPraxis is actively seeking cooperation with
other interested parties before submission to BizTalk.Org and XML.Org later
this month.  The next generation of gbXML-enabled CAD tools will allow
architects to estimate energy consumption and associated environmental
impacts as soon as their schematic designs are entered into CAD.  Engineers,
Construction Managers, and other design team members see the benefits too
since they will be able to refine the CAD files and re-perform the analyses
without having to re-enter the data into another program.?

Kennedy added, ?For building product manufacturers, CAD software vendors,
and A/E/C project extranets, the best news in this announcement is that this
schema is much more than a simple template to guide future schema and tool
development.  In fact, the schema has already been integrated into the
powerful IDEA Server(TM) web-based energy analysis application that is
available right now.  And the benefits of the schema will be available to
the users of the popular 3D CAD modeling software DesignWorkshop(R) by the
end of the year.?

Kennedy said he expects the schema will ultimately be adopted by the
International Alliance for Interoperability (IAI), the organization that has
been advocating data interoperability in the A/E/C industry for the past six
years.  The long elusive goal of interoperability received a big boost when
Bentley announced the publication of their aecXML standard last fall.  Since
then, GeoPraxis has been closely following aecXML developments.

?Our focus groups and survey of over 400 A/E/C 3D CAD users have confirmed
there is great demand for energy analysis tools that are easier to use than
what is currently available?, said Marketing Director Tom Conlon.  ?Almost
all the architects we have spoken with are excited about the advanced
capabilities this new technology will bring them.  No one wants to become an
energy expert if they don?t have to, and no one has time to re-enter data or
spend hours researching the properties of green building materials.?  Conlon
says that manufacturers who make information about their high performance
products compatible with the schema will be giving CAD users the easiest way
possible to evaluate their products.

President of Artifice, Inc. Kevin Matthews observed, "The new Green Building
schema provides a real advance in CAD integration, for all the right
reasons.  We will be supporting gbXML aggressively in our DesignWorkshop(R)
Professional architectural modeling, rendering, and walkthrough software."

"Using the gbXML schema, we can efficiently provide a new range of AEC
design and analysis capabilities.  From our consumer-level web-based
building design tools, to the high-level business and enterprise-level
energy simulation solutions we are creating with GeoPraxis, this schema is
the key to unlocking the power of the Internet for improved environmental
performance."

=============================
About XML.
Extensible Markup Language, or XML, is a meta-markup language that provides
a universal data format for describing structured information.  The
"extensibility" of the XML language makes it a very powerful business tool
for communicating and collaborating on the Internet. By developing and
implementing an "XML schema" or relational vocabulary specific to AEC
projects, organizations using the same schema could use their existing
software applications to send, receive, access and retrieve virtually any
type of project document or transactional data. It also gives AEC firms a
much more efficient and effective way for taking advantage of
e-collaboration and e-commerce opportunities, such as coordinating and
synchronizing related project information with clients as well as doing
business with suppliers and purchasers of equipment, materials, supplies,
parts and services.

=============================

John,

You might want to take a look at SunCast from www.ies4d.com 
You can create almost any shape that you like except real curve. And the
model you create for shading analysis can be use for further analysis with
ESP (Thermal Simulation) or Lighting with Radiance. 

SunCast even have facilities for you to "remove" walls/roof to observe what
is happening "inside" the building. 

Regards,

CK

Dear Mr Porter

One of the best tools for sunshade design I have come across is
Ecotect, an Australian simulation software product.
http://fridge.arch.uwa.edu.au/software/index_default.html
It is an architectural science tool, simple energy sim (uses CIBSE
admittance method) +acoustics, but it can automatically design a
sunshade given time and date parameters. There is a standalone
sunshade program in the suite of available programs but it will only
do rectangular best fit ...the main program will do a free form design
eg put a top and sides on a shade for a window and it will "cut" the
shade to the optimised form.

There is a simple graphical tool called the Libbey Owens Ford (LOF) Sun
Angle Calculator.  A description of how to use it is in Fuller Moore's book

1985.  A great daylighting book by the way.

some software dealing with the analysis of thermal bridges or the simulation
of heat transfer in 3D. I've already found Heat 3D (Heat 2D and FETH for 2D
analysis). Preferably, free software or demo versions (directly downloadable
would be great).
Thank you very much in advance.

Jose Hernandez

A good reference, perhaps dated, is U. S. Glass, Metal & Glazing magazine 
article, Aug 1989, by Todd W. Sitrin, provided to me by Southwall 
Technologies.  I advocate use of "reflector shade" as originally conceived 
by Steve Baer of Zomeworks to manage winter/summer transition of solar gain 
and daylight availability, though I haven't had the opportunity to manage an 
installation.  If subscribers have experience with this skylight treatment 
please let me know.  Also, having done numerous infrared scans, I have yet 
to see a skylight well and curb that have been insulated to my liking.  I 
advocate a "lay-light" glazing conforming to the ceiling plane to block 
air/heat/moisture movement to the skylight glazing.
Thanks!

Does anyone know of a good source for window properties?  I am trying to
model a skylight with 1/4" tempered glass (clear), 1/2" air space, 3/8"
laminated glass (clear) and 1 1/8" glazing.

Does anyone have experience with a variable speed drive on a centrifugal
blower used in an industrial vacuum system?
This is a 60 HP machine that is never loaded beyond 40% (power) - even with
an inlet bypass. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
The manufacturer has been useless (they already sold the machine and
apparently could care less about making it more efficienct, although they
did provide us with a performance curve)

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] GenOpt 1.1 beta released
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200005081405.AA053046MD34062@gard.com>

GenOpt(R) 1.1 beta has been released. GenOpt is a generic optimization
program developed by the Simulation Research Group at LBNL.

It is designed for minimization of a so-called objective function, such
as annual energy use, that is computed by an external simulation
program.

GenOpt can automatically determine the values of user-selected system
parameters such that optimal system performance is achieved. It can also
identify unknown parameters in a data-fitting process.

By modifying a configuration file, users can easily couple any external
program (like DOE-2, SPARK, BLAST, EnergyPlus, TRACE, TRNSYS, or any
user-written program with text-based input/output) to compute the
function being minimized.

GenOpt also offers an interface for implementing own optimization
algorithms in its library.

For more information, please visit http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov and
follow the link to GenOpt 1.1 beta.

You just received a message from the BLDG-SIM mailing list with the subject 
"ILOV3YOU" (with the 3 being an E).  The message you received did not include 
the attachment that contains the virus you may have heard about. The virus 
attachment was removed by the software on the GARD mail server prior to it being 
distributed so the message you received was safe and could not cause any virus 
problem on your computer.

For some good pointers on how to avoid viruses, please see today's TOURBUS post 
at:

http://listserv.aol.com/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0005A&L=tourbus&P=R183&m=1

For the recent virus the best suggestion is:

"IF SOMEONE UNEXPECTEDLY SENDS YOU AN EXECUTABLE FILE OR VISUAL BASIC SCRIPT 
FILE -- IN OTHER WORDS, A FILE THAT ENDS IN .EXE OR .VBS -- THROW IT OUT."

Sincerely,

Jason
