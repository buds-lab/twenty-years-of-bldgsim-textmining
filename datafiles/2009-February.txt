Message-ID: <0D1BF28FEB3F5040AC28FB4FC3ABEE63017CDACA@ag00-exmbx05.allegisgroup.com>

Hello All,

 

I know I already had sent an email out last week regarding an
opportunity for a Junior Modeler in the NYC area.  The position is still
open and I will attach a job description listing qualifications again.
Just to clarify, the position does not offer relocation unfortunately so
the individual must ideally be in the Northeast region (MA, NY, NJ, PA
etc.) and willing to relocate on their own if needed.  Please email or
call my direct line at 212-588-5850 to discuss further.

 

Thank you and have a great day!

 

Regards,

 

Joe Park, Recruiter

757 3rd Avenue. Suite 201, New York, NY 10017

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Energy Recovery Wheels (ERV) and Chiller Run Hours
Message-ID: <004801c9857a$1ed06d10$5c714730$@com>

Hello Bldg-Sim and eQuest Users,

 

I am having difficulty in eQuest V3.61 build 5653 (equivalent to 3.61e)
setting up an energy recovery wheel for an AHU with 60% min OA by design
serving typical offices/classrooms.  Without energy recovery, the chiller
run-hours seem reasonable (about 4,000 hrs) and I am getting very little
coincident cooling/heating in the winter months based on the SS-C report for
the AHU.  The AHU is set up with an enthalpy economizer and a min OA
schedule that is set to 0.001 for all hours to allow for economizer control
during night-cycle.  The AHU runs for 6,907 annual hours including 3,749
night cycle hours.  The zone thermostat type is proportional with a 2?F
throttling range.  All cooling and heating load hours are met and the
chiller does not operate at outside air temperatures lower than 48?F.

 

Once I enable the airside energy recovery (enthalpy wheel), the chiller
run-hours jump to nearly 7,400 hours and there are a significant amount of
coincident cooling/heating hours in all winter months.  The chilled water
loop control is set to demand (although I?ve tried a snap schedule resulting
in many unmet cooling hours).  I am controlling the ERV with the mixed air
temperature and an exhaust bypass.  I?ve tried scheduling the ERV to operate
at min OA and with a schedule matching the supply fan hours minus any
optimum start (-999) hours resulting in little change in the results.  I?ve
also tried the fixed setpoint control method (using MEP data for the make-up
air temperatures) with no success.

 

I can reduce the chiller run-time to about 4,600 hours with the ERV enabled
if I disable the night-cycle fan control option.  However, the unmet heating
and cooling hours become significant.  

 

>From what I can conclude through my trial and error approach is that
enabling night-cycle control also enables the ERV even with an On/Off
schedule calling for no ERV.  When the ERV is enabled, the chilled water
loop also becomes available to satisfy any cooling load that the ERV is
creating and operates down to the coldest hour.  I?m not sure if setting the
Min OA schedule of 0.001 (enable economizer) for all hours is affecting
whether or not the ERV is activated.

 

Any help with this control option or insight to the ERV calculations are
greatly appreciated.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Converting TMY, BIN and CSV files

Message-ID: <498788B5.4080907@edi-arch.com>

I've read through previous posts and attempted several iterations of 
converting to BIN with no avail. I can get the NEWTH.TMP file to appear, 
but with no information. Below is my step-by-step process, with info 
from previous posts. (Also, where is the "EXENT directory ?" I've been 
saving to the directory where the processor/excutables live.)

Get "real time" CSV weather data from Energy Plus website: 
http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/cfm/weatherdata/weather_request.cfm

Remove commas (or file breaks) from CSV file(s) in order obtain a TMY file

Using the DOE2 Conversion tool (http://doe2.com/index_Wth.html) use the 
following steps:

  <>
*1.    *Copy your TMY2 file to DOE2's EXENT directory and rename to 
WEATHR.TMP (*NOT* "WEATHR.TMP.TXT")

*2.    *Create a file called INPUT.TMP in the EXENT directory (*NOT* 
"INPUT.TMP.TXT"), /removing *IWEC *from in front of the station name*
*/

*3.    *In the INPUT.TMP file, put the following text. Be sure to 
replace the city, state, and station number as appropriate for your 
location. You can find this information in the first line of the TMY2 file.

  <>
PACK
ALBUQUERQUE INTERNATIONAL TMY2
TMY2  72365
STAT
END  <>

*4.* Run the DOEWTH.EXE executable (it will automatically use the 
WEATHR.TMP and INPUT.TMP files above as inputs). This will create a 
NEWTH.TMP file in the EXENT directory that is your bin weather file for 
use with DOE2. Just rename to Location.bin and you're set.


My WEATHR.TMP file looks like this, after removing the last digit of the 
weather station ID:

?Hello?All,

I have a problem with DOE2.1E cooling system sizing.??The cooling capacity reported by DOE2.1e in?SV-A and LS-B reports are quite different and shows?different sensitivity trends depending locations.??

Question 1
For the case with out door air flow ratio input?set to zero?DOE2.1E?calculated?cooling capacity and the peak coolig load are shown below.?? I assume that the?out door air contribution to the system load is zero for zero?out door air fraction and?with this?assumption?the system cooling capacity will be different from?the peak cooling load only due to difference in ARI?and the?peak cooling load?hour weather conditions.? What else could?cause the cooling capacity to be different from the peak load for zero out door air flow rate case?? I have looked into to DOE2.1E manual but wasn't able?connect the steps?from the peak cooling load to the system capacity?? 

Question 2
Does the?change from the peak cooling?load?to the ?system cooling capacity seem a reasonable for the different loacations given below? 
The building?is?2100 sqft conditioned floor area,?two story, single family house.??Each floor is modeled as a single zone.

John,
I have never had any trouble with the ERV module in eQUEST, I don't think
you found a bug.

You have to remember that when you use an ERV, the eQUEST default is to use
the HVAC fans (ERV integrated into the HVAC unit).  The fan static pressure
is increased to compensate for the increased pressure drop across the ERV.
 This extra SP increases both fan power and fan heat.  The increase in
cooling power you are seeing is a result of your systems having to
compensate for this increased fan heat.  The default increase in static
pressure for an ERV in eQUEST is 1.5" on both the supply and return.  Adding
3" of static to any fan system will have a big impact on the performance.
 If you are using packaged equipment that only has supply fans then all 3"
of SP will be applied to the supply fan which, if I had to guess, is what is
probably causing your problem.

The mixed air reset strategy with air bypass is the most efficient way to
run the ERV because it will allow the economizer to run by bypassing all the
exhaust air, that is why you don't see any change when you try different
parameters.

You can however try different ERV strategies to optimize the performance.
 For example using a self-contained ERV will reduce fan power and extra
cooling power (compared to an integrated ERV) because the fans are sized to
just handle the pressure drop of the ERV rather than having that pressure
drop transfered to the main HVAC fans.

One final hint: ERV defaults in eQUEST are set so the ERV's do perform
badly.  This is to encourage users to discover the best way to design an ERV
for there system configuration.  It's actually very easy to design ERV's
that use more energy rather than less, as you are finding out.

Good luck.  I hope this helps.

Bereket:
 
I would not expect the values in SV-A and LS-B to agree for most buildings. There are many reasons for this.
 
First, peak loads from LOADS do not include ventilation loads as would be the case in SYSTEMS, only infiltration. 
Second, you may be looking at different days on the weather file between LOADS and SYSTEMS, so this would 
need to be checked. 
 
In addition, DOE-2 sizes for the absolute peak, whereas other methods, such as Manual J, have some undersizing
built into the procedures, hence you'll almost always get a much larger system size in DOE-2. 
 
Both the SV-A and LS-B lists you show seem reasonable, with the exception of the MN #s, which I suspect that you
may have a fair bit of 24 hour infiltration in your input file...(i.e., low night time temps in MN?) 
However, without looking at the file I can only guess. 
 
There are 100s of reasons for the funny little differences you show.  You're probabloy better off running a Manual J 
calculation on the house if it is residential. DOE-2 is known for doing a very bad job of sizing for residential.

Another reason that the results are different is that the space temperature may be different in the "loads" part of the DOE-2 program than in the "systems" part of the program. In "loads", the space temperatures are set equal to the space design temperate. In "systems", the space temperature is based on the zone setpoint schedule and whatever temperature is actually achieved in the space. Thus, if you have a set up or a setback from the design space temperature, it will be different.

Ellen, 

Not exactly. What you wrote is definitely true during the SYSTEMS simulation and peak loads reported in SS-F (?), but Bereket was referring to the SV-A, which is the systems sizing report. Assuming that he's doing "auto-sizing",  the DOE-2 sizing routine will take the peak loads from LOADS and compute the design cooling capacity at the COOLING-DESIGN-TEMPERATURE. (I may have the keyword wrong, since I don't have a DOE-2 manual handy).  Thus, the termperature discrepancy between the single LOADS temperature and the COOLING-DESIGN-TEMPERATURE does exist, as you've mentioned, but transient loads due to tempeature set-up or set-back or interzone heat flows are not reflected. That's why an autosized SYSTEM will often still result in a few undercooled or underheated hours.

My suggestion to Bereket in making sense of the numbers is to compare the TEMPERATURE under SPACE-CONDITIONS for the LOADS reference temperature, to the COOLING-DESIGN-TEMPERATURE (I may have this keyword wrong) is ZONE-CONDITIONS in SYSTEMS. What kind of HVAC are you modeling?  It sounds like a residential system (RESYS), but that system doesn't have any OUTSIDE-AIR, does it ?

  In addition, DOE-2 sizes for the absolute peak, whereas other methods, such as Manual J, have some undersizing
  built into the procedures, hence you'll almost always get a much larger system size in DOE-2. 

  Both the SV-A and LS-B lists you show seem reasonable, with the exception of the MN #s, which I suspect that you
  may have a fair bit of 24 hour infiltration in your input file...(i.e., low night time temps in MN?) 
  However, without looking at the file I can only guess. 

  There are 100s of reasons for the funny little differences you show.  You're probabloy better off running a Manual J 
  calculation on the house if it is residential. DOE-2 is known for doing a very bad job of sizing for residential.

  Hello All,

  I have a problem with DOE2.1E cooling system sizing.  The cooling capacity reported by DOE2.1e in SV-A and LS-B reports are quite different and shows different sensitivity trends depending locations.  

  Question 1
  For the case with out door air flow ratio input set to zero DOE2.1E calculated cooling capacity and the peak coolig load are shown below.   I assume that the out door air contribution to the system load is zero for zero out door air fraction and with this assumption the system cooling capacity will be different from the peak cooling load only due to difference in ARI and the peak cooling load hour weather conditions.  What else could cause the cooling capacity to be different from the peak load for zero out door air flow rate case?  I have looked into to DOE2.1E manual but wasn't able connect the steps from the peak cooling load to the system capacity?  

  Question 2
  Does the change from the peak cooling load to the  system cooling capacity seem a reasonable for the different loacations given below? 
  The building is 2100 sqft conditioned floor area, two story, single family house.  Each floor is modeled as a single zone.

Jeff,

Thank you for the explanation.  

Yes I am modelig a residential building and using RESYS as a system.  Infiltration is specified and the zone load calculation reflects infiltration contribution to building load.  Since the outdoor air fraction is set to zero, I assume that  ventilation contribution to the building load or system capacity is also zero.  The space temperature for load calculation is set at 75 oF while the Design-Cool-T is 78 oF.  I beileive, this has the effect of decreasing the system cooling load.  

Jeff the peak design load day is different from that of the peak system days for some of the loacations.  However, the cooling load differences due to peak load and system peak day differences are quite small compared to the change I am looking at the peak load and system cooling capacity.

It is not obvious to me as to how the low temperature night cooling (due to 24 hour infiltration) results in in increasing the cooling capacity for the system?   

 
Bereket

Hi All,

I am modeling a residential building with RESYS as a system, and using auto sizing for system sizing.

The space temperature (space design temperature) for load calculation is set at 75 oF while the Design-Cool-T is set at 78 oF.  I believe that this has the effect of decreasing the system cooling capacity. There is no set-back or set-up applied.    No ventilation outdoor air is specified.  Infiltration, which is already captured in the building load calculation, is part of the building load.  

How does the system cooling capacity increases by more than 50% (in the case of Minneapolis and Duluth, Minnesota) compared to the building peak load in the absence of any out door air load for ventilation?  

Thanks,
 
Bereket

Ellen, 
 
Not exactly. What you wrote is definitely true during  the SYSTEMS simulation and peak loads reported in SS-F (?), but Bereket was  referring to the SV-A, which is the systems sizing report. Assuming that he's  doing "auto-sizing",  the DOE-2 sizing routine will take the peak loads  from LOADS and compute the design cooling capacity at the  COOLING-DESIGN-TEMPERATURE. (I may have the keyword wrong, since I don't have a  DOE-2 manual handy).  Thus, the termperature discrepancy between the single  LOADS temperature and the COOLING-DESIGN-TEMPERATURE does exist, as you've  mentioned, but transient loads due to tempeature set-up or set-back  or interzone heat flows are not reflected. That's why an autosized  SYSTEM will often still result in a few undercooled or underheated  hours.
 
My suggestion to Bereket in making sense of the numbers is  to compare the TEMPERATURE under SPACE-CONDITIONS for the LOADS reference  temperature, to the COOLING-DESIGN-TEMPERATURE (I may have this keyword  wrong) is ZONE-CONDITIONS in SYSTEMS. What kind of HVAC are you modeling?   It sounds like a residential system (RESYS), but that system doesn't have any  OUTSIDE-AIR, does it ?

Another reason that the results are different is that the space    temperature may be different in the "loads" part of the DOE-2 program than in    the "systems" part of the program. In "loads", the space    temperatures are set equal to the space design temperate. In "systems",    the space temperature is based on the zone setpoint schedule and whatever    temperature is actually achieved in the space. Thus, if you have a set up or a    setback from the design space temperature, it will be different.

Bereket:

There are many other reasons could explain the differences:

1. "System-Sizing-Ratio". For many system, eQUEST uses 1.15 "System-Sizing-Ratio".
2. Fan power. Different from space load calc, the system cooling capacity has to account for fan power heat as part of the cooling loads.
3. How about latent cooling? Have you accounted for latent cooling in your comparison?
4. Make sure the zones in LS-B and SV-A report are exactly the same. Has the loads from roof/ceiling be accounted for in the LS-B report?

I am surprised to see in your results that Minneapolis, MN has slightly higher cooling loads (20.3 kBtu/hr in LS-B) than Houston, TX (20.2 kBtu/hr in LS-B).

Jeff:

In your e-mail, you mentioned that "DOE-2 is known for doing a very bad job of sizing for residential". Is there any report/paper detailing this?

Assuming that he's doing "auto-sizing",  the DOE-2 sizing routine will take the peak loads from LOADS and compute the design cooling capacity at the COOLING-DESIGN-TEMPERATURE. (I may have the keyword wrong, since I don't have a DOE-2 manual handy).  Thus, the termperature discrepancy between the single LOADS temperature and the COOLING-DESIGN-TEMPERATURE does exist, as you've mentioned, but transient loads due to tempeature set-up or set-back or interzone heat flows are not reflected. That's why an autosized SYSTEM will often still result in a few undercooled or underheated hours.

My suggestion to Bereket in making sense of the numbers is to compare the TEMPERATURE under SPACE-CONDITIONS for the LOADS reference temperature, to the COOLING-DESIGN-TEMPERATURE (I may have this keyword wrong) is ZONE-CONDITIONS in SYSTEMS. What kind of HVAC are you modeling?  It sounds like a residential system (RESYS), but that system doesn't have any OUTSIDE-AIR, does it ?

Another reason that the results are different is that the space temperature may be different in the "loads" part of the DOE-2 program than in the "systems" part of the program. In "loads", the space temperatures are set equal to the space design temperate. In "systems", the space temperature is based on the zone setpoint schedule and whatever temperature is actually achieved in the space. Thus, if you have a set up or a setback from the design space temperature, it will be different.

Bereket:

I would not expect the values in SV-A and LS-B to agree for most buildings. There are many reasons for this.

First, peak loads from LOADS do not include ventilation loads as would be the case in SYSTEMS, only infiltration.
Second, you may be looking at different days on the weather file between LOADS and SYSTEMS, so this would
need to be checked.

In addition, DOE-2 sizes for the absolute peak, whereas other methods, such as Manual J, have some undersizing
built into the procedures, hence you'll almost always get a much larger system size in DOE-2.

Both the SV-A and LS-B lists you show seem reasonable, with the exception of the MN #s, which I suspect that you
may have a fair bit of 24 hour infiltration in your input file...(i.e., low night time temps in MN?)
However, without looking at the file I can only guess.

There are 100s of reasons for the funny little differences you show.  You're probabloy better off running a Manual J
calculation on the house if it is residential. DOE-2 is known for doing a very bad job of sizing for residential.

Hello All,

I have a problem with DOE2.1E cooling system sizing.  The cooling capacity reported by DOE2.1e in SV-A and LS-B reports are quite different and shows different sensitivity trends depending locations.

Question 1
For the case with out door air flow ratio input set to zero DOE2.1E calculated cooling capacity and the peak coolig load are shown below.   I assume that the out door air contribution to the system load is zero for zero out door air fraction and with this assumption the system cooling capacity will be different from the peak cooling load only due to difference in ARI and the peak cooling load hour weather conditions.  What else could cause the cooling capacity to be different from the peak load for zero out door air flow rate case?  I have looked into to DOE2.1E manual but wasn't able connect the steps from the peak cooling load to the system capacity?

Question 2
Does the change from the peak cooling load to the  system cooling capacity seem a reasonable for the different loacations given below?
The building is 2100 sqft conditioned floor area, two story, single family house.  Each floor is modeled as a single zone.

Hi all;

Can any one advice on the best HVAC system configuration for a house with a
high ceiling in the great room (other than installing a fan in the ceiling).
I have faced this problem many times. The way I was doing it is by over
sizing the AC unit for the second floor, and over sizing the furnace for the
first floor. But still, the thermostat in the second floor will not help in
making the lobby of the first floor much cooler that what it should be. The
same thing applies for the heating. Another way I was doing it is by having
one system for the entire house and run the fan continuously, but this
system is also in efficient, because I can not zone the house. Is there a
better way to do it and is there any research in this area?

Thank you.

H. Abaza

Bereket:

 

There are many other reasons could explain the differences:

 

1. "System-Sizing-Ratio". For many system, eQUEST uses 1.15
"System-Sizing-Ratio". 

2. Fan power. Different from space load calc, the system cooling capacity
has to account for fan power heat as part of the cooling loads.

3. How about latent cooling? Have you accounted for latent cooling in your
comparison?

4. Make sure the zones in LS-B and SV-A report are exactly the same. Has the
loads from roof/ceiling be accounted for in the LS-B report?

 

I am surprised to see in your results that Minneapolis, MN has slightly
higher cooling loads (20.3 kBtu/hr in LS-B) than Houston, TX (20.2 kBtu/hr
in LS-B).

 

Jeff:

 

In your e-mail, you mentioned that "DOE-2 is known for doing a very bad job
of sizing for residential". Is there any report/paper detailing this?

Hi All,

I am modeling a residential building with RESYS as a system, and using auto
sizing for system sizing.

The space temperature (space design temperature) for load calculation is set
at 75 oF while the Design-Cool-T is set at 78 oF.  I believe that this has
the effect of decreasing the system cooling capacity. There is no set-back
or set-up applied.    No ventilation outdoor air is specified.
Infiltration, which is already captured in the building load calculation, is
part of the building load.  

How does the system cooling capacity increases by more than 50% (in the case
of Minneapolis and Duluth, Minnesota) compared to the building peak load in
the absence of any out door air load for ventilation?  

Thanks,
 
Bereket

Xiaobing,

I?tried to incorporated the changes you (Xiaobing) suggested as follows but the results remained the same.?
1. The sizing ratio?was set?set to 1.0
2.? Fan power is accounted separately.? For this purpose I set the?supply air temperature rise (Supply-Delta-T = 0.) to zero
3.??The latent cooling load contributed by?occupants and infiltration has been accounted for?in?Load calculation.? The LS-B report show that.
4.? The zones in LS-B and SV-A report are different.? 

My problem is that I could get to the bottom of the cause for the difference between?LS-B and SV-A reports.

Any suggestion is highly appreciated.

How does the system cooling capacity increases by more than 50% (in the case of Minneapolis and Duluth, Minnesota) compared to the building peak load in the absence of any out door air load for ventilation??

Not exactly. What you wrote is definitely true?during the SYSTEMS simulation and peak loads reported in SS-F (?), but Bereket was referring to the SV-A, which is the systems sizing report. Assuming that he's doing "auto-sizing",? the DOE-2 sizing routine will take the peak loads from LOADS and compute the design cooling capacity at the COOLING-DESIGN-TEMPERATURE. (I may have the keyword wrong, since I don't have a DOE-2 manual handy).? Thus, the termperature discrepancy between the single LOADS temperature and the COOLING-DESIGN-TEMPERATURE?does exist, as you've mentioned, but transient loads due to tempeature set-up or set-back or?interzone heat flows?are not reflected. That's why an autosized SYSTEM will often still result in a few undercooled or underheated hours.
?
My suggestion to Bereket in making sense of the numbers is to?compare the TEMPERATURE under SPACE-CONDITIONS for the LOADS reference temperature,?to the COOLING-DESIGN-TEMPERATURE (I may have this keyword wrong) is ZONE-CONDITIONS in SYSTEMS. What kind of HVAC are you modeling?? It sounds like a residential system (RESYS), but that system doesn't have any OUTSIDE-AIR, does it ?

Another reason that the results are different is that the space temperature may be different in the "loads" part of the DOE-2 program than in the?"systems" part of the program. In "loads",?the space temperatures are?set equal to the space design temperate. In "systems", the space temperature?is based on the zone setpoint schedule and whatever temperature is actually achieved in the space. Thus, if you have a set up or a setback?from the design space temperature, it will be different.

Bereket:

I would not expect the values in SV-A and LS-B to agree for most buildings. There are many reasons for this.

First, peak loads from LOADS do not include ventilation loads as would be the case in SYSTEMS, only infiltration. 
Second, you may be looking at different days on the weather file between LOADS and SYSTEMS, so this would 
need to be checked. 

In addition, DOE-2 sizes for the absolute peak, whereas other methods, such as Manual J, have some undersizing
built into the procedures, hence you'll almost always get a much larger system size in DOE-2. 

Both the SV-A and LS-B lists you show seem reasonable, with the exception of the MN #s, which I suspect that you
may have a fair bit of 24 hour infiltration in your input file...(i.e., low night time temps in MN?) 
However, without looking at the file I can only guess. 

There are 100s of reasons for the funny little differences you show.? You're probabloy better off running a Manual J 
calculation on the house if it is residential. DOE-2 is known for doing a very bad job of sizing for residential.

Hello All,

I have a problem with DOE2.1E cooling system sizing.? The cooling capacity reported by DOE2.1e in SV-A and LS-B reports are quite different and shows different sensitivity trends depending locations.? 

Question 1
For the case with out door air flow ratio input set to zero DOE2.1E calculated cooling capacity and the peak coolig load are shown below.?? I assume that the out door air contribution to the system load is zero for zero out door air fraction and with this assumption the system cooling capacity will be different from the peak cooling load only due to difference in ARI and the peak cooling load hour weather conditions.? What else could cause the cooling capacity to be different from the peak load for zero out door air flow rate case?? I have looked into to DOE2.1E manual but wasn't able connect the steps from the peak cooling load to the system capacity?? 

Question 2
Does the change from the peak cooling load to the? system cooling capacity seem a reasonable for the different loacations given below? 
The building is 2100 sqft conditioned floor area, two story, single family house.? Each floor is modeled as a single zone.

Bereket:

There are many other reasons could explain the differences:
?
1. "System-Sizing-Ratio". For many system, eQUEST uses 1.15 "System-Sizing-Ratio". 
2. Fan power. Different from space load calc, the system cooling capacity has to account for fan power heat as part of the cooling loads.
3. How about latent cooling? Have you accounted for?latent cooling in your comparison?
4. Make sure the zones in LS-B and SV-A report are exactly the same. Has the loads from roof/ceiling be accounted for in the LS-B report?
?
I am surprised to see in your results that Minneapolis, MN?has slightly higher cooling loads (20.3 kBtu/hr?in LS-B) than Houston, TX (20.2?kBtu/hr in?LS-B).

In your e-mail, you mentioned that "DOE-2 is known for doing a very bad job of sizing for residential". Is there any report/paper detailing this?

Hi All,

I am modeling a residential building with RESYS as a system, and using auto sizing for system sizing.

The space temperature (space design temperature) for load calculation is set at 75 oF while the Design-Cool-T is set at 78 oF.? I believe that this has the effect of decreasing the system cooling capacity. There is no set-back or set-up applied.??? No ventilation outdoor air is specified.? Infiltration, which is already captured in the building load calculation, is part of the building load.? 

How does the system cooling capacity increases by more than 50% (in the case of Minneapolis and Duluth, Minnesota) compared to the building peak load in the absence of any out door air load for ventilation??

Message-ID: <002f01c98720$dc76b480$95641d80$@benayed@eb-engineers.com>

Hi All,

 

According to the LEED NC v2.2 user manual, the default process energy cost
is 25% of the total energy cost for the baseline building. 

 

Example:

The total energy cost for a baseline building is T = (X + Process loads) 

Let's assume that X = $1000.00 = 75% * T

 

To find the energy cost for a baseline building, we solve for T

Therefore T = $ 1000.00 / 75% = $ 1333.33

and the Process loads' cost = 25 % * $ 1333.33 = $ 333.33

This is how I understand the 25% process load calculation.

 

Can someone please confirm this approach? 

 

Thank you,

 

Anis

The process energy cost should compose at least 25% of the total energy
cost.

 

And yes, if you have a total cost of $1,333 then the process energy
should be >= $333.

FYI ... our take on this issue is to document the inputs that make up the
misc equipment.  In many cases, we find that misc equipment, or "process
loads" come nowhere close to 25% of total costs.

 

For example, we are currently working on a library LEED project.  We have
very good estimates for the number of computers going into the facility, and
have estimates for students with notebook computers, printer/copiers,
breakroom equipment (refrigerator, coffee pot, etc.), etc.  You can get
energy estimates for all that stuff from EnergyStar's website (they have lots
of good data), or take your own measurements of equipment over time like I
have ( using simple inexpensive equipment such as the "KillaWatt" plug in
120V plug load measurement device).

 

Anyway, we document it and add all that up ? comes to ~ 0.3 watts/SF, add a
schedule into our energy simulation program, and we come nowhere close to 25%
of total energy costs.

 

What would we do at that point?  We have good wattage inputs based on sound
and reasonable data.  For example, a typical desktop computer will use ~ 65
watts on average.  A 22" flat panel LCD monitor will use ~ 45 watts.  So, do
you throw all those numbers out and arbitrarily increase the "watts/SF"
values until process loads = 25%?

 

Our interpretation is no.

 

Based on the following from LEED NC 2.2

 

  

 

We interpret this as we can use less than 25% as long as we document, so we
document.  We document our assumptions for process loads anyway so if it
comes out less, we're covered.

 

We did have a project that was a flight simulator building for the US Air
Force.  The simulator equipment used a ton of energy ? energy costs > 75% of
total building energy costs.  That blew the LEED savings out of the water.
Even if you assign the same load to the baseline, mathematically it's very
difficult to achieve overall building energy savings of  14% if 75% of energy
? you can't do anything about.  J.  In fact, we could not.

 

Just some food for thought on how we approach this area.

 

Hope this helps.

James

The process energy cost should compose at least 25% of the total energy cost.

 

And yes, if you have a total cost of $1,333 then the process energy should be
>= $333.

Hi All,

 

According to the LEED NC v2.2 user manual, the default process energy cost is
25% of the total energy cost for the baseline building. 

 

Example:

The total energy cost for a baseline building is T = (X + Process loads) 

Let's assume that X = $1000.00 = 75% * T

 

To find the energy cost for a baseline building, we solve for T

Therefore T = $ 1000.00 / 75% = $ 1333.33

and the Process loads' cost = 25 % * $ 1333.33 = $ 333.33

This is how I understand the 25% process load calculation.

 

Can someone please confirm this approach? 

 

Thank you,

 

Anis

Hussein,
Best practice for building configurations that involve temperature stratification (atriums, high ceiling spaces etc...) is to  design them using CFD for load and air distribution. If you regularly come across this configuration, it might be worth it to get a proper CFD study done on it. It must include heat transfer by radiation which become very important as the difference in temperature increase between the house sufaces.
 
It will clarify how the air distribution performs in the space, it will show what capacity you need and where you should locate the sensors. By helping to visualise what's happening in the house and comparing it with heat loads calcs, it will give you a feeling for things that you will be able to apply to your next projects.  

Best Regards

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Residential System for High Ceiling house



Hi all;

Can any one advice on the best HVAC system configuration for a house with a high ceiling in the great room (other than installing a fan in the ceiling). I have faced this problem many times. The way I was doing it is by over sizing the AC unit for the second floor, and over sizing the furnace for the first floor. But still, the thermostat in the second floor will not help in making the lobby of the first floor much cooler that what it should be. The same thing applies for the heating. Another way I was doing it is by having one system for the entire house and run the fan continuously, but this system is also in efficient, because I can not zone the house. Is there a better way to do it and is there any research in this area?

Thank you.

H. Abaza

Bereket:

 

There are many other reasons could explain the differences:

 

1. "System-Sizing-Ratio". For many system, eQUEST uses 1.15 "System-Sizing-Ratio". 

2. Fan power. Different from space load calc, the system cooling capacity has to account for fan power heat as part of the cooling loads.

3. How about latent cooling? Have you accounted for latent cooling in your comparison?

4. Make sure the zones in LS-B and SV-A report are exactly the same. Has the loads from roof/ceiling be accounted for in the LS-B report?

 

I am surprised to see in your results that Minneapolis, MN has slightly higher cooling loads (20.3 kBtu/hr in LS-B) than Houston, TX (20.2 kBtu/hr in LS-B).

 

Jeff:

 

In your e-mail, you mentioned that "DOE-2 is known for doing a very bad job of sizing for residential". Is there any report/paper detailing this?

	Hi All,
	
	I am modeling a residential building with RESYS as a system, and using auto sizing for system sizing.
	
	The space temperature (space design temperature) for load calculation is set at 75 oF while the Design-Cool-T is set at 78 oF.  I believe that this has the effect of decreasing the system cooling capacity. There is no set-back or set-up applied.    No ventilation outdoor air is specified.  Infiltration, which is already captured in the building load calculation, is part of the building load.  
	
	How does the system cooling capacity increases by more than 50% (in the case of Minneapolis and Duluth, Minnesota) compared to the building peak load in the absence of any out door air load for ventilation?  
	
	Thanks,
	 
	Bereket

	Ellen, 

	 

	Not exactly. What you wrote is definitely true during the SYSTEMS simulation and peak loads reported in SS-F (?), but Bereket was referring to the SV-A, which is the systems sizing report. Assuming that he's doing "auto-sizing",  the DOE-2 sizing routine will take the peak loads from LOADS and compute the design cooling capacity at the COOLING-DESIGN-TEMPERATURE. (I may have the keyword wrong, since I don't have a DOE-2 manual handy).  Thus, the termperature discrepancy between the single LOADS temperature and the COOLING-DESIGN-TEMPERATURE does exist, as you've mentioned, but transient loads due to tempeature set-up or set-back or interzone heat flows are not reflected. That's why an autosized SYSTEM will often still result in a few undercooled or underheated hours.

	 

	My suggestion to Bereket in making sense of the numbers is to compare the TEMPERATURE under SPACE-CONDITIONS for the LOADS reference temperature, to the COOLING-DESIGN-TEMPERATURE (I may have this keyword wrong) is ZONE-CONDITIONS in SYSTEMS. What kind of HVAC are you modeling?  It sounds like a residential system (RESYS), but that system doesn't have any OUTSIDE-AIR, does it ?

		Another reason that the results are different is that the space temperature may be different in the "loads" part of the DOE-2 program than in the "systems" part of the program. In "loads", the space temperatures are set equal to the space design temperate. In "systems", the space temperature is based on the zone setpoint schedule and whatever temperature is actually achieved in the space. Thus, if you have a set up or a setback from the design space temperature, it will be different.

		I would not expect the values in SV-A and LS-B to agree for most buildings. There are many reasons for this.
		
		First, peak loads from LOADS do not include ventilation loads as would be the case in SYSTEMS, only infiltration. 
		Second, you may be looking at different days on the weather file between LOADS and SYSTEMS, so this would 
		need to be checked. 
		
		In addition, DOE-2 sizes for the absolute peak, whereas other methods, such as Manual J, have some undersizing
		built into the procedures, hence you'll almost always get a much larger system size in DOE-2. 
		
		Both the SV-A and LS-B lists you show seem reasonable, with the exception of the MN #s, which I suspect that you
		may have a fair bit of 24 hour infiltration in your input file...(i.e., low night time temps in MN?) 
		However, without looking at the file I can only guess. 
		
		There are 100s of reasons for the funny little differences you show.  You're probabloy better off running a Manual J 
		calculation on the house if it is residential. DOE-2 is known for doing a very bad job of sizing for residential.

		Hello All,
		
		I have a problem with DOE2.1E cooling system sizing.  The cooling capacity reported by DOE2.1e in SV-A and LS-B reports are quite different and shows different sensitivity trends depending locations.  
		
		Question 1
		For the case with out door air flow ratio input set to zero DOE2.1E calculated cooling capacity and the peak coolig load are shown below.   I assume that the out door air contribution to the system load is zero for zero out door air fraction and with this assumption the system cooling capacity will be different from the peak cooling load only due to difference in ARI and the peak cooling load hour weather conditions.  What else could cause the cooling capacity to be different from the peak load for zero out door air flow rate case?  I have looked into to DOE2.1E manual but wasn't able connect the steps from the peak cooling load to the system capacity?  
		
		Question 2
		Does the change from the peak cooling load to the  system cooling capacity seem a reasonable for the different loacations given below? 
		The building is 2100 sqft conditioned floor area, two story, single family house.  Each floor is modeled as a single zone.

We have a two story great room in Colorado. I will admit that the  
climate is mild and sunny here. This means that the hot air goes to  
the ceiling (20 feet 8 meters or so) during the the day and tries to  
sink as cold air at night. However, we find that our over sized, slow  
running Casablanca fan is perfect for setting up total comfort. It  
will push the air up or down, it is totally quite, comes in a wide  
variety of classic and contemporary designs (everything from Humphrey  
Bogart to the Jetsetsons), moves the air slowly without drafts. .

Hi all,

 

I would like to check my simulation results for fan power calculation for
system 7 (VAV w/ reheat) but not sure what the specific (w/ft/year) for a
typical baseline office building is. Can anyone share some values? 

 

Thank you for your input,

The word ?default? is unfortunate; the credit language should read ?at
least?.  If your project is under 25% simply submit justification for why
you are under 25%.  The best way to do that is with a table showing the
assumed plug loads or other process loads in the facility.

 

So if you are over 25% no worries; if you are under justify why you are
under.  Don?t add process loads until you reach precisely 25% as some
projects submitting for LEED have done.

 

Regarding facilities with very high process loads pursuing LEED
certification, James is correct that this poses a major problem which the
USGBC will hopefully address this year.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Spam:Re: Process Loads?

 

FYI 
 our take on this issue is to document the inputs that make up the misc
equipment.  In many cases, we find that misc equipment, or ?process loads?
come nowhere close to 25% of total costs.

 

For example, we are currently working on a library LEED project.  We have
very good estimates for the number of computers going into the facility, and
have estimates for students with notebook computers, printer/copiers,
breakroom equipment (refrigerator, coffee pot, etc.), etc.  You can get
energy estimates for all that stuff from EnergyStar?s website (they have
lots of good data), or take your own measurements of equipment over time
like I have ( using simple inexpensive equipment such as the ?KillaWatt?
plug in 120V plug load measurement device).

 

Anyway, we document it and add all that up ? comes to ~ 0.3 watts/SF, add a
schedule into our energy simulation program, and we come nowhere close to
25% of total energy costs.

 

What would we do at that point?  We have good wattage inputs based on sound
and reasonable data.  For example, a typical desktop computer will use ~ 65
watts on average.  A 22? flat panel LCD monitor will use ~ 45 watts.  So, do
you throw all those numbers out and arbitrarily increase the ?watts/SF?
values until process loads = 25%?

 

Our interpretation is no.

 

Based on the following from LEED NC 2.2

 

 

 

We interpret this as we can use less than 25% as long as we document, so we
document.  We document our assumptions for process loads anyway so if it
comes out less, we?re covered.

 

We did have a project that was a flight simulator building for the US Air
Force.  The simulator equipment used a ton of energy ? energy costs > 75% of
total building energy costs.  That blew the LEED savings out of the water.
Even if you assign the same load to the baseline, mathematically it?s very
difficult to achieve overall building energy savings of  14% if 75% of
energy ? you can?t do anything about.  J.  In fact, we could not.

 

Just some food for thought on how we approach this area.

 

Hope this helps.

 

Regards,

 

James

The process energy cost should compose at least 25% of the total energy
cost.

 

And yes, if you have a total cost of $1,333 then the process energy should
be >= $333.

Hi All,

 

According to the LEED NC v2.2 user manual, the default process energy cost
is 25% of the total energy cost for the baseline building. 

 

Example:

The total energy cost for a baseline building is T = (X + Process loads) 

Let?s assume that X = $1000.00 = 75% * T

 

To find the energy cost for a baseline building, we solve for T

Therefore T = $ 1000.00 / 75% = $ 1333.33

and the Process loads? cost = 25 % * $ 1333.33 = $ 333.33

This is how I understand the 25% process load calculation.

 

Can someone please confirm this approach? 

 

Thank you,

 

Anis

There is new research I have seen that points to air tightness as the  
real issue with temperature stratification in houses.  Tight houses  
seem to have much less temperature differences top to bottom, and the  
mechanical issues seem to get much simpler to deal with (certainly no  
over-sizing units needed).

Last year at NESEA, IBACOS, Building Science Corp and Steven Winter  
showed a batch of low-energy homes that had been monitored to check  
for stratification.

http://be07.org/documents/1-Wednesday/Track2-Residential_Bldgs_High_Perf_Homes/Sess1-Zero_Energy_Homes-This_Years_Crop/Zero_Energy_Homes_Prahl_IBACOS.pdf

Page 21 has temperature plots from a monitored Passivehouse in Urbana  
IL (air tightness below 0.6 ACH50) showing minor difference in  
temperature in cathedral ceiling spaces.

Test for air tightness throughout construction (especially before  
insulation is installed), set a target, hold the contractors to it...

For energy intensive environments, I have had LEED accept a lesser process
load, especially when the building in question is a renovation to an
existing building with poor original envelope.  If you had the process load
equal between the baseline and proposed, and the baseline is really
inefficient, then sometimes the process load completely dwarfs the load of
the proposed building.  It makes more sense to estimate the process load
based on reasonable power densities and use schedules for the space types.

I have successfully used the miscellaneous power densities given in the
90.1-2004 User's Manual to define process loads for LEED projects.

Marcus,

Hope you're doing well. A quick question as a follow up.

I have a campus building that is using district chilled water and steam - and the energy modeling is based on "Required Treatment of District Thermal Energy in LEED NC 2.2 and LEED for Schools". The project is seeking only 2 points and the model only includes downstream equipment keeping the district heating and cooling cost neutral in both the base case and the design case.

The cost of steam is around $44.2 per Mlb of Steam, cost of chilled water $0.18 while that of electricity only $0.09 base don campus rates.  Since the cost of steam and chilled water is way higher than that of electricity, there is no way that process energy cost which includes equipment, elevators, etc equates to 25%. Cost of space heating and cooling constitutes a bigger fraction compared to lighting, equipment, pumps and all others end uses that use the electric rate.

Would a narrative explaining the same justify why the minimum 25% requirement cannot be held for district heating and cooling systems that model only downstream equipment and are kept cost neutral due to the differential in the rate structure.

Thanks

The word "default" is unfortunate; the credit language should read "at least".  If your project is under 25% simply submit justification for why you are under 25%.  The best way to do that is with a table showing the assumed plug loads or other process loads in the facility.

So if you are over 25% no worries; if you are under justify why you are under.  Don't add process loads until you reach precisely 25% as some projects submitting for LEED have done.

Regarding facilities with very high process loads pursuing LEED certification, James is correct that this poses a major problem which the USGBC will hopefully address this year.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Spam:Re: Process Loads?

FYI ... our take on this issue is to document the inputs that make up the misc equipment.  In many cases, we find that misc equipment, or "process loads" come nowhere close to 25% of total costs.

For example, we are currently working on a library LEED project.  We have very good estimates for the number of computers going into the facility, and have estimates for students with notebook computers, printer/copiers, breakroom equipment (refrigerator, coffee pot, etc.), etc.  You can get energy estimates for all that stuff from EnergyStar's website (they have lots of good data), or take your own measurements of equipment over time like I have ( using simple inexpensive equipment such as the "KillaWatt" plug in 120V plug load measurement device).

Anyway, we document it and add all that up --> comes to ~ 0.3 watts/SF, add a schedule into our energy simulation program, and we come nowhere close to 25% of total energy costs.

What would we do at that point?  We have good wattage inputs based on sound and reasonable data.  For example, a typical desktop computer will use ~ 65 watts on average.  A 22" flat panel LCD monitor will use ~ 45 watts.  So, do you throw all those numbers out and arbitrarily increase the "watts/SF" values until process loads = 25%?

Our interpretation is no.

Based on the following from LEED NC 2.2

[cid:image001.jpg at 01C98784.EE340830]

We interpret this as we can use less than 25% as long as we document, so we document.  We document our assumptions for process loads anyway so if it comes out less, we're covered.

We did have a project that was a flight simulator building for the US Air Force.  The simulator equipment used a ton of energy --> energy costs > 75% of total building energy costs.  That blew the LEED savings out of the water.  Even if you assign the same load to the baseline, mathematically it's very difficult to achieve overall building energy savings of  14% if 75% of energy --> you can't do anything about.  :).  In fact, we could not.

Just some food for thought on how we approach this area.

Hope this helps.

James

The process energy cost should compose at least 25% of the total energy cost.

And yes, if you have a total cost of $1,333 then the process energy should be >= $333.

Hi All,

According to the LEED NC v2.2 user manual, the default process energy cost is 25% of the total energy cost for the baseline building.

Example:
The total energy cost for a baseline building is T = (X + Process loads)
Let's assume that X = $1000.00 = 75% * T

To find the energy cost for a baseline building, we solve for T
Therefore T = $ 1000.00 / 75% = $ 1333.33
and the Process loads' cost = 25 % * $ 1333.33 = $ 333.33
This is how I understand the 25% process load calculation.

Can someone please confirm this approach?

Thank you,

Anis

Yes just quantify the non-regulated or process loads in the model.  The
purpose behind the 25% was to try and make sure that folks were modeling
everything in the building which affects total energy use.

According to the LEED NC v2.2 user manual, the default process energy cost
is 25% of the total energy cost for the baseline building. 

 

Example:

The total energy cost for a baseline building is T = (X + Process loads) 

Let?s assume that X = $1000.00 = 75% * T

 

To find the energy cost for a baseline building, we solve for T

Therefore T = $ 1000.00 / 75% = $ 1333.33

and the Process loads? cost = 25 % * $ 1333.33 = $ 333.33

This is how I understand the 25% process load calculation.

 

Can someone please confirm this approach?

Howdy Bldg Sim peers!

While working on LEED Equest simulations I find that in an effort to simplify I end up deleting the P-Inf and C-Inf Infiltration Schedules all of the time and end just use "undefined" to simulate a constant infiltration rate.  I was curious to know if anyone uses the actual Infiltrations schedules, to emulate winds and or building pressurization, and if so do you typically achieve more energy savings, and do you find it worth the extra effort?

Thanks all and be well.

Assuming they have their own dedicated remote outdoor condensers or condensing units, I don't think they should effect you heating and cooling loads.? 
The energy they use though would need to be counted in your process loads though.

Greetings,

I'm wondering if anyone's firm would be interested in providing Rocky
Mountain Institute with some case studies and data for one of our research
initiatives, Next Generation Utility (NGU):
http://ert.rmi.org/research/ngu.html

To help prove the value of energy efficient design to major utilities, we're
compiling a database of case studies of various commercial building types in
different climate zones that have exceeded minimum codes by at least 40%
through efficiency measures alone. If any of you have worked on buildings
that meet this criteria, would you be willing to share your reports/case
studies with RMI? Ideally, we're looking for data on end use energy savings,
and case studies for Hospitals/Health Care Facilities,
Restaurants/Supermarkets, and Lodging or High Rising Housing.

Anything that is provided to RMI and use within our NGU research will cite
your firm and its involvement in achieving this design. If you would be
wiling to share your great work with us, please send reports and case
studies to Eric Bloom, at ebloom at rmi.org.

Thank you very much for your help!

Hi all:

 

We do building envelope consulting and are very curious as to what folks do
and what rates they use whatever approach.  When looking at buildings we
find that most  infiltrate much more in the real world than designers
estimate and that the fluctuations are far greater than predicted.  We would
also love it if anyone has any experiences which can be shared.

 

Thanks,

 

Andy

Howdy Bldg Sim peers!

 

While working on LEED Equest simulations I find that in an effort to
simplify I end up deleting the P-Inf and C-Inf Infiltration Schedules all of
the time and end just use "undefined" to simulate a constant infiltration
rate.  I was curious to know if anyone uses the actual Infiltrations
schedules, to emulate winds and or building pressurization, and if so do you
typically achieve more energy savings, and do you find it worth the extra
effort?

 

Thanks all and be well.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Passive Houses & Re: Resid. System for High Ceiling
In-Reply-To: <mailman.1.1233864068.16235.bldg-sim-onebuilding.org@lists.onebuilding.org>
References: <mailman.1.1233864068.16235.bldg-sim-onebuilding.org@lists.onebuilding.org>
Message-ID: <1233966787.3135.1298994757@webmail.messagingengine.com>

It is true that Passive houses with cathedral ceilings don't show much
temperature stratification, and that is due in part to their extreme
airtightness (max. 0.6 ACH at 50 pa). But air-tightness is only part of the
reason for very little stratification - the  extreme superinsulation and
the balanced ventilation through the ERV (or HRV) is the other half of
the story. 

If you were to retrofit a moderately insulated house to comply with the
Passive House air-tightness test without adding insulation, you would
still see the temperature stratification, because convection currents
would develop within the house due to the relatively high conductive
heat loss through building envelope cooling the adjacent air, which
would sink to the lowest point, to be replaced by the warmest air in the
middle of the house rising to the peak, to lose its heat through the
roof in turn. The Fairview Ave 2 Urbana IL House cited by Jesse below
has Nominal R54 wall and under-slab insulation and Nom. R82 roof
insulation, far exceeding the recommendations of LEED & Building Green
America. 

Katrin Klingenberg, founder of Passive House Institute US,
www.passivehouse.us, and designer of the house, got IBACOS to monitor
the house because they didn't buy her assertions about lack of
stratification and the necessity of all aspects of the Passive House
Standard requirements being met in order to achieve the high performance
levels these homes do. The P.H. Standard is an integrated system for
designing ultra low energy homes using only about a 10th of the energy
of a code compliant house, but you can't achieve the standard of
performance without doing the energy calculations and ensuring that the
building is built or retrofitted to the Passive House specifications
during construction down to the last detail. Many folks are inspired by
Passive Houses and try to get an untrained builder to do one for them
without paying to have the calculations done, and they may get a good
building out of it, but it is unlikely that they'll be able to heat it
with the minimum ventilation air requirement as any Certified Passive
House can. Though Passive Houses are relatively new in the US, the
standard has been refined and tested thoroughly in Europe over the past
decade, and there are now more than 15,000 buildings built or renovated
to this voluntary Standard worldwide, and growing exponentially. 

So if you are trying to retrofit a new heating/ cooling system into an
existing high-ceiling home that is not a Passive House and you want
minimal temp. stratification, there are two basic strategies that will
work, and you must decide what you want  to accomplish:
1. Retrofit to meet the Passive House Standard, including super
windows/doors, super-insulation, continuous air-tight layer, & ERV or
HRV, and enjoy superior comfort and reliably low energy costs into the
forseeable future, 
OR 
2. Put your money into mechanical systems and do only modest low-cost
building retrofits like air-tightening (make sure to get all the leaks
w/ multiple blower-door tests, and avoid cold condensation surfaces
within the structure), put in your ERV/ HRV and choose mechanical/
supplemental heating systems that can deal with the convection currents
and stratification that will remain, and budget for the higher energy
bills for the life of the building. Radiant floors in a moderately
insulated building can help minimize temp stratification and draftiness,
since the radiant heat is even throughout the building and is down in
the occupied zone. Ceiling fans or better yet a ducted fan can help move
warm air back down into the occupied zone, but if you don't keep the
airspeed down they can have a negative effect on your comfort through
evaporative cooling of your body in the airstream.

Having been to the Low-income/ affordable Fairview houses and other
Passive Houses in bitter winter weather as well as hot humid summers, I
choose to put my money into a Passive House building envelope, because
it is more comfortable, healthy, durable, and better for the planet. It
really gives you peace of mind to be in a building that can keep itself
warm in winter & cool in summer, even through unpredictable weather and
power outages. I encourage any of you on this list to go the
P.H.Institute's trainings, www.passivehouse.us, and learn how to design
to the P.H. Standard yourself - these are the only affordable buildings
that can meet the carbon emission reduction levels we need to do if we
are to avert run-away climate change in our lifetimes, so we need all
the designers and builders we can get on board.

Join up, I can use the competition and comradery!

FYI:
 
This can be done, but it requires "tricking" the simulation. 
 
First, DOE-2 has a lower limit on zone temperatures, which is hard to override. We did a paper in 1985 (ASHRAE Transactions) where we simulated an ice rink and a swimming pool with DOE-2 at a rec center. To trick DOE-2 into calculating the heat loss from the ice rink we bumped up the UA to compensate for the lower delta T. 
 
Another way to do this is to drop a (-) SOURCE into a zone...that has the equivalent cooling load as the freezer and/or cooler. However, you'd
need to know what the cooling load is on the unit...with most of the freezers I've seen the biggest load is in the cool down of product, and/or the 
infiltration into/out of the unit as employees go in/out all day long. Hard to tell what this would be. 
 
Finally, if the condenser to the unit is inside the restaurant, then you'll have a heat gain to the space equal to the condenser load plus the heat off the compressor.
 
I'm sure you'll find some other, more recent papers on modeling restaurants. For example, there were several excellent Seminar presentations 
at the Chicago meeting. Not exactly modeling, but very good presentations on reducing energy use in restaurants.
 
Good luck.

    I won an ASME regional design contest prize with my Solar House 
design, a graduating
    semester design project. It was later fully detailed and built in 
1986. We moved in Jan
   1987. It is basically a LEED Platinum building, one story with 
finished basement, 2x6
    studs 24 OC upstairs with 1" XPS sheathing, brick vernier 100%, etc.

    The main surprises vis a vis air infiltration  were / are

    1) The porosity of the above grade basement CMUs allowing air 
infiltration.
    2) The top or finish course of CMUs was not always sealed from an 
air infiltration
       point of view and many of these CMU cores were hidden behind 
finish dry wall
       for years.
    3)The air return duct through the attic even though sealed with 
metal tape and covered
       with R-25 batts was not sealed to the attic penetration / wood 
surround for years.
    4) One bathroom had an outside wall stud space with no insulation at 
all - it contained
       the plumbing  vent stack. The framing crew and insulation crews 
thought we were
       'over insulated' and just didn't need it.
    5) None of the plumbing stacks were sealed at the attic penetration 
on the outside
       by the work crews.
    6) The Active Solar plumbing penetrations were not sealed at the 
attic penetration
       by the work crews.
    7) Rodentia bent the clothes dryer outside vent flap so severely 
that it would not close
       completely on its own, but we never had mice enter the house via 
this access.
    8) Conventional plumbing stack boots, black rubber, were utterly 
destroyed by the
       heat from the Active Solar pipes. We made silicon rubber fittings 
to replace them.
       We run an oversquare ( more sq ft collector than gal of tankage ) 
system with 6/12
       slope 20 degrees W of S at  ~ 38:45 N. We use the active system 
for more than
       domestic hot water. Since we sabotaged the evil tempering valve =-O 
       we have all metal bodied valves through out the house and a 
stainless steel tub on the
       dishwasher.
    9) None of these problems was detected by a military grade IR video 
shot from outside
       the house in freezing cold weather.  IR shot inside the attic was 
extremely revealing.
    10) Leak testing has to be done during windy weather -- the leaks 
act in concert., and
       CFD considerations show that differing pressures exist at 
specific locations.

Our all electric bill for 4500 sq ft this last December was  $72.00

We are developing a new version of this house with architectural as well 
as energy improvements.

I tend to model an air exchange rate of 0.15 ACH in perimeter spaces during
unoccupied hours (e.g. outside air fans are off with dampers closed) for new
buildings (even if they have air barriers).  Vestibules, conditioned loading
docks, etc usually get higher air change rates.  Zones with no exterior
exposure should not be modeled as having any infiltration since there is not
a way for air at outside conditions to make it to these zones.  I assume no
infiltration into plenum zones.  

 

I am curious to know whether or not this seems reasonable based on real
world experience.  Andy, any thoughts?

 

Thanks,

 

Eric

Hi all:

 

We do building envelope consulting and are very curious as to what folks do
and what rates they use whatever approach.  When looking at buildings we
find that most  infiltrate much more in the real world than designers
estimate and that the fluctuations are far greater than predicted.  We would
also love it if anyone has any experiences which can be shared.

 

Thanks,

Dear Andy and Eric,
 
My past experience with industrial buildings (manufacturing, assembly,
warehouses, etc) indicates that a good building has an AVERAGE winter AC/hr
of ~0.2.  Poor buildings are on the order of 0.5 (or more!) 
 
This doesn't address residences (which often have much higher infiltration
rates) offices or high rises, but it may be helpful.  Most of the literature
I'm familiar with indicates that infiltration is normally a lot higher than
is generally assumed.  My experience confirms that.

Is the 0.2 to 0.5 ACH based on blower door testing?  Did you apply some
sort of conversion to get from the blower door pressure differential to
a typical real world pressure?

You don't really do blower door testing on 100,000 - 1,000,000 sq.ft factory
buildings, however we did something that was roughly equivalent.  My
company's air handler product normally used a control loop that monitored
differential pressure between the building and the outdoors, and then
controlled the outdoor air amount to maintain a slight (0.01") positive
pressure.  Since the controls were very often digital and we could obtain
data from the AHU performance, we knew what the outdoor air control was
doing over the course of a day, or weeks, or months.
 
>From that information, we created some "rules of thumb" that were applied to
new projects.

Hey folks:

 

We have done similar things to control outside air and create positive
pressure then look at the losses in a variety of ways and have seen reports
of work done by various labs and even reports on whole buildings with the
giant tractor trailer blower unit.  They always see much much higher than
predicted/designed infiltration and higher energy cost/comfort issues but
not always significantly (5% is significant to me but not to all) higher
cost in heavy cooling areas due to what seems to be both the infiltration
that occurs when the conditioned air is cooler/less humid on the interior
and the comparatively low cost to cool.  

 

We have very limited experience in industrial but in office, commercial,
retail, and similar have seen from James numbers (his range is mostly the
low end we have seen) to 5 times them and even more.   The numbers tend to
go completely crazy when we have tried to look at real world effects and
apply parameters such as actual in use conditions for office, commercial or
retail buildings.  We have never seen an existing building that was at the
'design parameters'.  I am not saying that as a negative toward anyone who
did or does design nor about the assumptions in the models but am saying
that it needs to be looked at as we need to end up saving most of our
energy, carbon, cost, whatever all you care about through work on existing
structures.  We can not build our way to enough savings of any type
particularly in a 10 to 30 year horizon.  

 

I would not presume no infiltration at plenums (2 years after a building is
up seal up an area, pressurize it and see what you get) and would assume
significant infiltration at penthouses, elevator rooms, and so on.  

 

Eric, my thought would be that if you are going to apply a number across the
board, so to speak, you may want to go to .20 bare minimum and I would
suggest .25.  My bet is James does a lot of .4 to .5 in design work with
very tight structures.

 

We have not yet done anything specifically following the letter of the newer
large building standards/suggestions for testing from ASTM/ASHRAE et al.

 

Thanks,

 

Andy

You don't really do blower door testing on 100,000 - 1,000,000 sq.ft factory
buildings, however we did something that was roughly equivalent.  My
company's air handler product normally used a control loop that monitored
differential pressure between the building and the outdoors, and then
controlled the outdoor air amount to maintain a slight (0.01") positive
pressure.  Since the controls were very often digital and we could obtain
data from the AHU performance, we knew what the outdoor air control was
doing over the course of a day, or weeks, or months.

Is the 0.2 to 0.5 ACH based on blower door testing?  Did you apply some sort
of conversion to get from the blower door pressure differential to a typical

Dear Andy and Eric,

 

My past experience with industrial buildings (manufacturing, assembly,
warehouses, etc) indicates that a good building has an AVERAGE winter AC/hr
of ~0.2.  Poor buildings are on the order of 0.5 (or more!) 

 

This doesn't address residences (which often have much higher infiltration
rates) offices or high rises, but it may be helpful.  Most of the literature
I'm familiar with indicates that infiltration is normally a lot higher than
is generally assumed.  My experience confirms that.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Infiltration Schedule

I tend to model an air exchange rate of 0.15 ACH in perimeter spaces during
unoccupied hours (e.g. outside air fans are off with dampers closed) for new
buildings (even if they have air barriers).  Vestibules, conditioned loading
docks, etc usually get higher air change rates.  Zones with no exterior
exposure should not be modeled as having any infiltration since there is not
a way for air at outside conditions to make it to these zones.  I assume no
infiltration into plenum zones.  

 

I am curious to know whether or not this seems reasonable based on real
world experience.  Andy, any thoughts?

 

Thanks,

Hi all:

 

We do building envelope consulting and are very curious as to what folks do
and what rates they use whatever approach.  When looking at buildings we
find that most  infiltrate much more in the real world than designers
estimate and that the fluctuations are far greater than predicted.  We would
also love it if anyone has any experiences which can be shared.

Howdy Bldg Sim peers!

 

While working on LEED Equest simulations I find that in an effort to
simplify I end up deleting the P-Inf and C-Inf Infiltration Schedules all of
the time and end just use "undefined" to simulate a constant infiltration
rate.  I was curious to know if anyone uses the actual Infiltrations
schedules, to emulate winds and or building pressurization, and if so do you
typically achieve more energy savings, and do you find it worth the extra
effort?

 

Thanks all and be well.

All,

Is there any place in the detailed output report that shows energy saved
in kBtu/hr if the system has heat recovery?  Specifically I have a DX
RTU, and I am adding an enthalpy wheel for heat recovery on the
ventilation air in the parametric runs.  I am showing a cost savings for
the ERV but I cannot find any load savings in the detailed reports to be
able to justify the cost savings.  Any help would be welcome.  

Thank you for your time.

Hi all,

 

Has anyone submitted for LEED EAc1 using the "Required Treatment of District
Heating?"  

How is the total number of points calculated? 

 

Is it the number of points calculated in step 2 as long as that number is
not 4 points above what was calculated in step 1?

 

Thank you,

Does anybody out there know how to reach the 2008 Building Energy Data
Book?
Its link (http://buildingsdatabook.eren.doe.gov/) doesn't seem to be
active anymore.
Thanks,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] convection coefficient for internal fluw in rectangular
	duct
Message-ID: <3cbed0ed0902120223t4a1afb71m91ea12933461b03d@mail.gmail.com>

Dear,

could anyone suggest me a correlation for the convection coefficient in a
rectangular duct valid for both laminar and turbulent flow? Or more in
particular I'm looking for a convection coefficient that describes the
effects for the hollow space in beteen two panels of a panel radiator with
convecter blades (type 22 radiator).

Thanks a lot!

How bizzare. I can open it from my iPhone but not from my desktop in IE,

Hello,

Has anyone attended one of the eQUEST Trainings through the Energy Center of Wisconson?  I'm interested in attending the upcoming March session but would like some feedback before committing.  Is this training beneficial to new eQuest users?

This takes me back a few years. Yes there is data on the different
output, convective and radiative for different radiators with and
without fins.(if this is what you require?)

I have an old Buderus handbook from about 1980 which has the different
values, I believe Recknagel-Sprenger carries different values. I think I
also have some values in my Masters thesis references, but this would
really be scraping the barrel and would require me taking a trip to the
garage and searching through a dozen carefully ignored archive boxes.

 

Is this what you are looking for?

Hello everybody:

Has any one experienced, used or heard about softwares that can run complete
mesoscale climate models!!
(i.e. fluid thermodynaimcs, water content, vegetation, built environment,
....etc). 
I wonder what a great, powerfull and superior creator who can operate such huge
issues in reality whilst We may spend days running only a small detailed
microscale climate simulation !! 

However, any guide would be appreciated.


Thanks,
Mohamad.

Dear All,

Can any one tell me how to incorporate the district cooling/heating system 
as I am not finding this provision in the equest 3.62b. Need to understand 
how to model a building in case if the building utilises district

Subject: [Bldg-sim] DX Cooling EIR Ratio Curve
Message-ID: <870055.61412.qm@web58102.mail.re3.yahoo.com>

Hi,
?
I used the default DX Cooling EIR Ratio Curve (DX-Cool-Cap-fEWB&OAT)?in eQUEST.?The variables are t entering wetbulb?and t enter condenser. I?assume these refer to outside air wet and dry bulb temperatures. After?exporting outside air wet and dry bulb temperatures in hourly report,?the value of "Temp correction to COOLING-EIR" I calculated is different to the one in the hourly report by using the curve coefficients. Can anyone point out if my understanding is correct?
?
Thanks a lot for your help

Shaojie,
 
I believe you should be concerned with the wetbulb temp of the mixed air
entering the coil (unless you are 100% OA). If I remember correctly, I
went through the same analysis once. It becomes a little difficult
because I don't believe the mixed air wetbulb is a variable that you'll
find available in the hourly reports. But if you do the manual
calculation things should start to come together.
 
Good luck,
 
  Jonathan M. Curtin, EIT, LEED(r) AP

Yes, our project which I had a previous posting regarding using
hydraulic elevators as the baseline and traction as the proposed case
did make it through LEED certification for a platinum building.

Following up on the topic of taking credit for the Elevator Efficiency
for the proposed case as compared to the LEED baseline, has anyone been
able to successfully document it and eventually gained approval from the
LEED reviewers. If so could you please share the methodology.

Jonathan and Glenn,
?
Thanks a lot?for your replies. However, the values I calculated by using return or mixing air wet bulb temperatures are still different to the number listed in the hourly report. 
?
Thanks

The wet bulb temperature refers to that entering the evaporator, which is the return air wet bulb temperature.

Hi,

?

I used the default DX Cooling EIR Ratio Curve (DX-Cool-Cap-fEWB&OAT)?in eQUEST.?The variables are t entering wetbulb?and t enter condenser. I?assume these refer to outside air wet and dry bulb temperatures. After?exporting outside air wet and dry bulb temperatures in hourly report,?the value of "Temp correction to COOLING-EIR" I calculated is different to the one in the hourly report by using the curve coefficients. Can anyone point out if my understanding is correct?

?

Thanks a lot for your help

Hi, 
I tried to open a file, which was finished in E+ 2.2, in the new version of 3.0. But a lot of warnings came out in the IDF Editor, saying "Object type not recognized" and then "Too many errors were found when working with the file". Then the program just stopped. The file worked in 2.2 quite well, but I don't know what happened in the new version.

Any suggestiongs or comments are highly appreciated.

Zhuolun,

This may help: Try opening the file in E+ 3.0 version again, but before running it or opening the .idf file, go to file tab and run it as 'transition version'
This should fix the errors.

Thanks,

Hi All,

I am trying to run the one zone example file for evaporative cooler.  The file is one of the example files "1ZoneEvapCooler.idf " that come with EnergyPlus version 3.0.
 Energy plus file crashes  while invoking the zone temperature predictor corrector.

Did any body run this example file successfully?

Best regards,

Message-ID: <20090218074902.443EA48008@diego.dreamhost.com>

 

Hi friends,

 

I am trying to model an Earth Air Tunnel (EAT) system that is being used in
a school for passive precooling.

During summer first the air is pre cooled using the EAT and then evaporative
cooling is done before being circulated into the zone.

During monsoon again precooling is done using EAT and then chillers are
being used for further cooling and dehumidification.

Does anyone have any idea as to how to calculate and incorporate the degree
of precooling that is achieved by the EAT into the eQuest model.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks

Message-ID: <2C3CF455489D6B4F95AFAB84847FA4131CF346B6DC@E2K7-MS2.ds.strath.ac.uk>

It is traditional for IBPSA Simulation conferences to offer
facilities for workshops by software vendors in conjunction
with the conference. This year we are expecting 300-350
people to come to the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow
in July and this audience may include many that are interested
in workshops, networking and user group activities.

The Building Simulation 2009 conference (http://www.bs2009.org.uk)
will be held in from the 27th to the 30th of July and will close
early in the afternoon on Thursday the 30th. Facilities will
be available up to and including Saturday the 1st of August
for software vendors who wish to offer workshops to their clients
or for user groups. Conference delegates will be able to register for
workshops during registration for the conference.

There are several types of rooms available for hosting workshops
with and without desktop PCs for half day, one day and two day
sessions. Coffees and lunches are provided. There will be standard
participant fees for the facilities depending on the room and duration. The
fees (after costs) will be split between the Conference and
the organizer (as was done in Montreal).

If your group or company would like more information please
email Jon Hand (jon at esru.strath.ac.uk) to discuss available
options.

Vishnuraj-

This is very difficult and may not lead to the correct results, but one
method would be to manually edit the weather file.  You would need to change
the temperatures so that the outdoor air that is pulled into the system
would be at the temperature of the earthduct preconditioned air.  However, I
would not recommend doing this without testing to see how it changes the
other aspects of the simulation.

I have seen earthducts modeled correctly in both MATLAB and TRNSYS but I
have not successfully modeled it within eQuest.

You could use OA from system, give the supply air a temperature schedule,
and put the equipment that conditions this air on a separate meter (as there
will be only fan energy required, not heating and cooling).

This, of course, assumes that you know what temperature the air will be
coming in at, but leaves everything else the same.

Message-ID: <99A2815FF4D295488E034407278B16A402970358@sacexm01.nexant.corp>

Based off of reviewing past archives on variable refrigerant flow, Trace
700 and Energy Pro appear to be the only 2 current programs that can
accurately model a VRF system.  
 
Has anyone had any success modeling a VRF system for a LEED project
using Trace 700 or Energy Pro?  If yes, do you have a preference on
which program is more user-friendly for this application and were there
any challenges, you would care to share, encountered while modeling this
type of system for LEED.
 
Any responses would be much appreciated.
 
Thanks
Jim

John,
 
I am guessing you are referring to AutoCAD Background files that you use to get the building geometry input. And, one crude way to get rid of these files is to change the location of referenced Autocad files and try opening the equest file, and message will pop up asking for the reference files, with in the options you will also see "remove all backgrounds". this should do it. Once the file is opened,  save and close it. and next time around the equest file will load faster. 
 
I hope this helps.

Jeff,
?
The system type is DX packaged single zone. From the hourly report, I found sometimes Temp correction to COOLING-EIR, Part load correction to COOLING-EIR and Operating EIR are zero when Cool on/off flag is on. Is there a specific condition?that?these parameters?can equal zero?

Thanks a lot

don't forget that the COOL-FT-MIN is used as a minimum
value for the curve input for the extering condenser temperture.
COOL-FT-MIN is also for the evap min temperature into
the curve. So low OA temps and low entering wetbulb will not be
fully reflected into the curve values.

COOL-FT-MIN default
(cond temp curve low limit)

The wet bulb temperature refers to that entering the evaporator, which is the return air wet bulb temperature.

Hi,

I used the default DX Cooling EIR Ratio Curve (DX-Cool-Cap-fEWB&OAT)?in eQUEST.?The variables are t entering wetbulb?and t enter condenser. I?assume these refer to outside air wet and dry bulb temperatures. After?exporting outside air wet and dry bulb temperatures in hourly report,?the value of "Temp correction to COOLING-EIR" I calculated is different to the one in the hourly report by using the curve coefficients. Can anyone point out if my understanding is correct?

Hi All,

Sorry for the multiple postings:

On the eQuest list-serve right now we're developing a wish-list of things we
wish the program could do, but doesn't.  It occurred to me that we should
start a master list of things that most programs can't do, or don't do well,
and make this info available to people developing modeling programs.

I'll volunteer to keep a list.  Please send me:

1.  your wishlist: proof-read please!  Please fully describe your wishes so
that anyone coming from any simulation program can understand.  Please
create three categories of comments:

            General: these requrests should be regarding navigation, ease of
use, and general program set-up
            Specific: these requests should be regarding program calculation
abilities, libraries, etc.
            Functionality: Please describe any attributes of a program you
use now that you find important or extremely useful
            Contact:  Please let me know if it's ok to put your name and
email address next to your comments.  This way if anyone reads your comment
and finds it useful or has more questions, they can contact you!

2.  If you are a program developer, please send me your contact info so that
I can send you the master list when I'm finished.

Hopefully if we can get a comprehensive list together, we'll get some much
needed functionality in the new programs coming out.

Feel free to send this on to other simulation list-serves

Thanks!!

Thank you all for the help.

One way that we are thinking of to model it is using the indirect and direct
evaporative cooling system both as a separate system.

Indirect system can then be made to the work of Earth Air Tunnel(EAT) of
sensibly precooling.

After this the direct evaporative cooler can further bring down the
temperature as well as humidify the air.

During the monsoon season the fan schedule for the direct cooling system can
be kept off and only indirect system will do the sensible precooling.

However one difficulty here is that we are not able to give the cooling
capacity for the indirect evaporative cooling system.eQuest accepts it only
for DX coils 

and cooling coils when chillers are being used.

 

We are trying to work along these lines and if anyone has any suggestion
please do share.

If we are able to come up with any solution, will certainly let you all
know.

Thanks again for your response.

Vishnuraj-

This is very difficult and may not lead to the correct results, but one
method would be to manually edit the weather file.  You would need to change
the temperatures so that the outdoor air that is pulled into the system
would be at the temperature of the earthduct preconditioned air.  However, I
would not recommend doing this without testing to see how it changes the
other aspects of the simulation.

I have seen earthducts modeled correctly in both MATLAB and TRNSYS but I
have not successfully modeled it within eQuest.

Hi friends,

 

I am trying to model an Earth Air Tunnel (EAT) system that is being used in
a school for passive precooling.

During summer first the air is pre cooled using the EAT and then evaporative
cooling is done before being circulated into the zone.

During monsoon again precooling is done using EAT and then chillers are
being used for further cooling and dehumidification.

Does anyone have any idea as to how to calculate and incorporate the degree
of precooling that is achieved by the EAT into the eQuest model.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks

Jim -
Unfortunately I don't yet have experience in modeling VRF systems, but I have some info... At the moment, the EnergyPro package would be the one to use for VRF.  Both of the major VRF manufacturers do stand behind the EnergyPro algorithm, and performance curves from current VRF equipment are used in that software.  You'll likely find it more cumbersome than TRACE, but TRACE's VRF system has not really been validated to my knowledge (anyone from CDS, please clarify if I'm mistaken).

eQUEST developer's do plan to introduce VRF in a version in the near future, but I haven't heard any recent updates on the schedule for that.

There are two versions of VE-ware one for revit and one for sketchup.
Go to the IES website and at the top find the revit pull down menu to

I have been asked by an ME/AE firm to check out IES-VE Energy.  This
firm makes extensive use of the Revit programs for design.

I downloaded the trial version of  'IES-VE-Ware/Toolkits 5.9 Setup' and
tried to run/install it and I got the following message:  "You require
an installation of Google Stetchup 6, etc., to install VE-Ware"

I downloaded 'IES<VE>5.9 SketchUp Plug-in Setup' and tried to install
this and got the following message:  "You must have a copy of
IES<Virtual Environment>5.9 installed before attempting to install this
plug-in"

I am interested in trying out IES-VE Energy component only.  Is there a
trial version for this?  Is there a tutorial that I can refer to when
trying to learn how to use this program?

The IES-VE website shows 2 engineering clients - Syska Hennessy and
Vanderweil Engineering.  How many building projects have been analyzed
with IES-VE for energy performance by US AE firms?  

Why use IES-VE-Energy when DOE2.1E and eQUEST are free and TRACE and HAP
are inexpensive with excellent customer support?

Is there statistical data by type & size of project, on the energy
programs used in the US for code compliance and LEED certification?

REVIT MEP comes with the IES VE load analysis built in. But I think you need to have the full version to analyze the energy consumption based on systems and lighting etc.
 
I have found that as long as the spaces have been set up correctly by the architect in Revit generating the geometry for the energy model is done by Revit and takes a couple of minutes to determine interior vs exterior walls/windows etc. (depending on the size of the building and the capacity of the computer doing the calculations).  The calculations will generate a room by room load calculation which can be imported back to the model and allocated to the individual spaces.
 
Vs doing an import of the Autocad drawing and tracing the shape, locating windows etc.  Time savings can be significant.
 
However, I have only yet used it for loads for equipment sizing and not for an energy simulation.

I strongly advise you not to use this option. If Revit, looses a room, it's likely that you'll not even notice it. I created a full model of a 50million project within Revit from the Architectural model. Loaded it into IES and lost 75% of all rooms, that's over 200 rooms, all lost. 
My solution is, purchase the software, draw all model from sratch within IES of Sketchup, Stay away from IES with Revit, it always falls over or is incorrect or requires 3 or 4 times of repetitive data entry e.g. construction properties.

Thanks for the responses and telephone calls.  Most of them were sent to me directly.  The general picture I got was that TRACE700 does a better job of importing Revit data than IESVE.  Importing and other problems can be fixed.  Is the IESVE program in metric only?.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] IES-VE Energy
Message-ID: <1ed6bcd10902231230m22e5e151q7b1443142f6b83a5@mail.gmail.com>

Varkie,
  IES-VE is a great program to use for energy simulations and
qualifies for LEED simulations (EA Credit 1). Why use IES-VE? IES-VE
is very good for in-depth analysis of HVAC systems and their controls
(not strong on the water side, but very good on the air side). Also,
IES-VE creates great outputs (large selection, nice graphs, charts,
and more). Also, IES-VE creates an actual 3-D model that is nice to
have to visualize the actual building.

As far as Revit to IES plug-in, this is a different story. I have
found it easier to take 2D Cad files and extrude the DXF files. This
creates a much cleaner model that is much easier to change later. The
Revit Plug-in will work, but the Revit model must be drawn perfectly
with no errors. Also, the Revit model might need some tweaking before
converting to IES (I.E. if the Revit model has a columns in the middle
of a room that are surrounded by walls (common), then IES-VE will
recognize this as a hole in the model).

Next, IES also has a great support staff. If you run into any
problems, they are easy to contact and respond pretty quickly with the
solution.

Finally, IES-VE can be used for more than just energy simulations.
Detailed daylighting analysis, CFD analysis, regular lighting/glare
analysis, and more can all be done within IES.

Hope this helps.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] La Jolla CA weather data
Message-ID: <cdf76d820902231237k3c46f426g6e25039264332658@mail.gmail.com>

All,

Does anyone know if because of being right on the shore, La Jolla's weather
is much different from San Diego's?

The Energy Plus Weather Data website has two of its 5 San Diego Locations 10
miles away from La Jolla. Should using one of these two files suffice for
climate analysis or is there more specific information for La Jolla
available out there?

Thanks,

The main determinant is the closeness of the site to the ocean, which 
has an  ameliorating effect on the climate. Therefore, I would use North 
Island (Station Number 722906) or even Imperial Beach (Station Number 
722909), in preference to the other three.

I also back Ban full heartily on all his points. We here are using
IES-VE in Australia to meet Australia's Green Star Credits. In addition
the IES support team in Melbourne is fantastic and always always do
their very best to solve/fix and review our models & problems.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] IES-VE Energy

Varkie,
  IES-VE is a great program to use for energy simulations and
qualifies for LEED simulations (EA Credit 1). Why use IES-VE? IES-VE
is very good for in-depth analysis of HVAC systems and their controls
(not strong on the water side, but very good on the air side). Also,
IES-VE creates great outputs (large selection, nice graphs, charts,
and more). Also, IES-VE creates an actual 3-D model that is nice to
have to visualize the actual building.

As far as Revit to IES plug-in, this is a different story. I have
found it easier to take 2D Cad files and extrude the DXF files. This
creates a much cleaner model that is much easier to change later. The
Revit Plug-in will work, but the Revit model must be drawn perfectly
with no errors. Also, the Revit model might need some tweaking before
converting to IES (I.E. if the Revit model has a columns in the middle
of a room that are surrounded by walls (common), then IES-VE will
recognize this as a hole in the model).

Next, IES also has a great support staff. If you run into any
problems, they are easy to contact and respond pretty quickly with the
solution.

Finally, IES-VE can be used for more than just energy simulations.
Detailed daylighting analysis, CFD analysis, regular lighting/glare
analysis, and more can all be done within IES.

Hope this helps.

Can anyone advise if there's a better way to switch the DX rooftop
air-handling units to chilled water and hot water systems with chillers
and boilers after detailed data editing in eQUEST? I used Wizard Data
Editing but all the detailed data input for hundreds zones could not be
saved. Is there any other way so I don't need to redo the detailed
editing all over again? Thanks.

Jim -
Unfortunately I don't yet have experience in modeling VRF systems, but I
have some info... At the moment, the EnergyPro package would be the one
to use for VRF.  Both of the major VRF manufacturers do stand behind the
EnergyPro algorithm, and performance curves from current VRF equipment
are used in that software.  You'll likely find it more cumbersome than
TRACE, but TRACE's VRF system has not really been validated to my
knowledge (anyone from CDS, please clarify if I'm mistaken).

eQUEST developer's do plan to introduce VRF in a version in the near
future, but I haven't heard any recent updates on the schedule for that.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] eQuest:  Modeling a Texas Multizone
Message-ID: <A649D1E68E0A43BB9D1ABE4D2F838DD8@AmandaPC>

I'm looking for information on how to model a Texas Multizone in eQuest.  

 

A Texas Multizone has a cold deck and a neutral deck (instead of a hot
deck).  There are hot water coils in the zone ducts.  

 

I'm currently modeling this system as a Multizone unit and have set the hot
deck leaving air temperature to 75F (room neutral air).  I'm getting a
tremendous amount of unmet load hours when I do this.  From what I can see,
eQuest doesn't have a good way to place hot water coils in zone ducts.  Our
best guess has been baseboard heat, but that isn't quite right.

 

If you have any insight on how to model this, or ideas on what could be
considered thermodynamically equivalent, please let me know.

 

Best Regards,

Amanda Bogner, PE LEED AP

Hello Mark,

For accurate airflow modeling in and around buildings CFD (Computational
Fluid Dynamics) tools would be most suitable. You can use commercial CFD
tools like Flovent, Fluent, Pheonix, CFX etc. or you can also use OpenSource
CFD libraries like OpenFaom.

Sophi,

My suggestion for major hvac changes is to save a new copy of the model by using the save as feature.  Then in the new file set up the new hvac system in the wizard mode.  Finally, open up both of the .inp files in notepad and copy in the chillers and boilers from the "wizard" file into the existing file.  Just make sure you don't copy over the input for the zones.  This gets tricky at times, because you need to know what actually needs to be copied over from the "wizard" file.  You will get errors opening the adjusted existing file if you copy either too much or too little.  I would suggest copying everything that you think needs to copied and then make sure that every U-name that is referenced (equipment names, schedules, loops, etc.) is now in the adjusted existing .inp file.

Does anybody know the best way to model an AHU with internal compressor that is water cooled with an external tower?  The AHU sits in a insulated mechanical room with return air and OA dumped directly into the Mech room.  I know eQuest has the capability to do this, however you do not have the ability to choose whether the VAVs are parallel or series boxes.   So I started a model in VisualDOE, and I think the water loop heat pump is the closest VisualDOE can get to this system, however I would like to see if anyone has successfully modeled this type of system.

Hello All,
I am struggling to iron out the workflow with my group as far as MEP design and compliance documentation.  We do design, high performance - sustainable modeling and compliance documentation for M, E and P.
>From the HVAC standpoint that involves Trace for loads, eQuest for modeling and LEED, and EnergyPro or eQuest for Title-24 documentaion.

1) eQuest Title-24 documentation has a LARGE HOLE.  The lighting, LTG, forms are not filled out by the software completely.  This is specifically related to the lighting schedule and controls credit worksheets. In EnergyPro, controls credits are picked from a list in the software depending on the application. The associated credit is listed on the credit worksheet by room.  eQuest has no drop down.  You enter a credit amount (ie 0.2 w/SF) on the compliance tab.  I merely prints a blank line on the form for you fill out "by hand"!  Are we cave men?

2) How do others (I hope you are out there!!) deal with this workflow?

Just scroll down the page a little bit and you will find the file.

I tried searching for the "eQuest variable name" for the outside air

We use DOE-2.2 (EQuest only for visual / tabular debugging as we work  
in SI in Australia) and IES VE.

If all you want is an energy program then stick with 2.2/EQuest you  
can't beat it and it will do 95%+ of what you want and quickly.  Its  
the other 5% that drives us (Lend Lease design in Australia) to use VE  
extensively plus the fact that VE is an integrated modelling  
environment allowing the assessment of thermal comfort, mixed mode  
systems, daylight an shading visualisation.  The latter it does poorly  
and we tend to build a separate Ecotect model for better visualisation  
and sun path diagrams with shadow masks - pretty nifty.

If you are just dealing with energy then VE is different from 2.2 /  
eQuest in the following key ways:
- Very limited waterside capability as previously noted.  To overcome  
this we use DOE-2.2 chiller curves etc and hourly VE loads in a big  
spreadsheet to model our cooling and heating plants.  I still haven't  
found anything Excel can't do given lots of RAM and MHz.  With the  
types of cogen and absorption systems we are looking at these days, I  
can't see DOE-2.2 being able to explicitly model some of the complex  
plant arrangements and generator controls we are seeing so  
spreadsheets do offer increased flexibility.

- DOE-2 has a template approach to systems where you tweak parameters  
and select from pre-determined control philosophies.  VE allows you to  
control almost any node in your air network from the properties of  
another node (leaving zone, return air etc).  Where this is handy is  
with dedicated outdoor air systems where you are seeking humidity  
control with the primary air not temperature control and the zones  
having an active or passive chilled beam.  You can also cascade  
airflows from a floor plenum or rock store into a supply duct or space  
and then into a relief or return air path.

- Temperature and comfort predictions are more reliable where airflows  
are being cascaded as above in VE, but the true reliablity is of  
course up to the modeller - garbage in gives garbage out.

- Solar tracking in VE is far more advanced than DOE-2 though still  
with some limitations - this is useful in projects where solar tracks  
deep into a space / building such as atria etc.

- Ability to split zones into a number of zones to allow  
stratification (underfloor / atria etc) and allow relief air from  
multiple systems into a space - DOE-2 allows a sunspace to be used as  
a return air path for one system ...

- Cooling coils in VE use a constant contact or bypass factor  
regardless of conditions.  DOE-2 uses an advanced coil model which  
dynamically changes the sensible and total cooling capacities  
depending on on-coil conditions.  I have never assessed how important  
this is but I suspect it is quite important for certain types of  
systems in cities such as Sydney and Brisbane where a lot of our work  
is.

- Reporting - all the data is there in VE and Vista is quite good for  
charting and binning heaps of data, but VE lacks standard template  
like reports which makes debugging / assessing a big model really tough.

- DOE-2.2 runs much quicker.  For comparable 30,000 m2 buildings I  
would say DOE-2 runs in 1 minute and IES VE with an APhvac network  
probably 1-2 hours.  If you through in Macroflo it probably adds  
another hour of simulation time.  As a result iterative trial and  
error debugging has to be done on a 1-2 week period.


Re Revit, our experience is the CAD model needs to be almost purpose  
built for thermal modelling to import cleanly.  Instead we use a DXF  
with only select layers turned on as an underlay to snap to in ModelIT  
- far quicker.  Also VE does not do IP units as far as I know.

Ultimately we still use both programs and we love them in their own  
unique ways - I don't think we will ever have one program that does all.

Graham Carter

Graham,
The comment below stands out which might also be the reason for not using EnergyPlus on large projects.
- DOE-2.2 runs much quicker.  For comparable 30,000 m2 buildings I would say DOE-2 runs in 1 minute and IES VE with an APhvac network probably 1-2 hours.  If you through in Macroflo it probably adds another hour of simulation time.  As a result iterative trial and error debugging has to be done on a 1-2 week period.
Large building projects (1 to 10 million sqft) with up to 1,000 zones and 70 systems ranging in size from 10,000 to 200,000 cfm (pardon the English units - the USA & the Bahamas are not going to switch to metric) require several iterative runs to get the input errors fixed.  Breaking up the project into small pieces is not a solution since it affects demand costs, central plants and other components.  I have worked on such projects using DOE2.1E and TRACE600/700.  
eQUEST is not suitable for such projects either.  One of its limitations is that you cannot enter the space names shown on architectural drawings. Others include assuming all the input data and making all the decisions for you when you enter the type of building.  1000 zones means 1000 infiltration schedules and multiples of other building components. It is unrealistic to check all the input created by eQUEST for errors. Fixing everything to match the exact project data has to be done in detailed edit.  Detailed edit means you lose access to the graphical method of creating the building model from AutoCAD drawings which is the main benefit of this program.

Epact 2005 tax credits were extended to 2013 in the recent "Stimulus
Package."

 

I'm looking at a page on the DOE web site that lists approved software
used obtain Epact 2005 tax credits, and I notice eQuest is not
specifically listed. DOE-2.1 is listed however. Does anyone know if
eQuest will be acceptable for EPact 2005 simulations?

 

The link to the list is given above.

Any help is appreciated.

As I remember, Green Building Studio (GBS) is on the list. Since GBS runs eQUEST (and other software?) behind the screen, can the tax credits be granted if the building performance simulation is conducted by eQUEST through GBS. I'm a bit confused here. Can anyone shed light on this issue?

Through Green Building Studio yes, except the current version of GBS 3.4 is not on the list either, although it is submitted for approval.  Same boat for EnergyPlus...version 3 is not listed.

Hopefully these will be reviewed soon!

For good, bad or indifferent.  

 

If the software (exact version) is not listed it is not accepted for Epact
so far as we know.

 

Chris, beware anyone who says something not listed is accepted, we have
heard of others who have done all the work only to have to do it again.

 

Thanks,

 

Andy

I frankly don't understand the criteria of acceptance for software 
approval.  It seems to accept any program that's self-described as 
capable of dynamic simulations with time-varying inputs and outputs, and 
has gone through the ASHRAE/ANSI Standard 140 comparisons. But Standard 
140 is just a cross-program comparison for very simplified cases, sort 
of digital hot-box experiments, if you will.  Does this mean that all 
simulations done with these programs are valid and credible ?  Any DOE-2 
simulation ? Any EnergyPlus simulation ? Of course not.  It's all in the 
inputs, and if the inputs or modeling are faulty, the results could be 
all over the map.   If we compare this criteria of acceptance to 
California's Title-24 Certification of compliance programs, the 
approaches are almost completely opposite.  Here, the criteria are 
whether the programs have the right fundamentals or "intentions" ; 
there, the criteria are whether the programs give the right results.  
I'm afraid we're leaving the barn door open for a lot of questionable 
claims backed up by the use (or abuse) of supposedly approved software.

Varkie,

I disagree with your statement that eQuest is not appropriate for large
buildings because you can't change space names to match architectural names
in wizard mode, and the inputs created from the wizard aren't appropriate
for all spaces.  The wizards are called "Schematic Design Wizard" and
"Design Development Wizard" for a reason.  They aren't desinged for detail,
they're designed to help you make big design decisions quickly.  If you want
the building to be modeled as closely as possible to the final design, this
takes some extra work.  Yeah, re-naming spaces is a pain, but at 5 seconds
per space, re-naming 1,000 spaces takes about 1.5 hours, well worth the
effort.  If you re-name zones too, maybe it's 3 hours total.

Yeah, some things about eQuest are clumsy, like why does it create one
underground wall (and floor) consturction for each surface, when only 4-5
are needed for the whole model?  Why does it re-create occupancy, lighting
and micellaneous equipment schedules for each shell, even if the use is the
same?  And why does it create tons of duplicate infiltration schedules?
BUT... this takes an hour or two to clean up, and then you have a decently
flexible model that gives you reasonable results in a matter of minutes.
Versus a program that takes 1-2 hours to run.  I've done a few LEED projects
in Trace700 and it's painful modeling a design case and four (rotated) base
cases at 1-2 hours each, especially if you then find you've left anything
out.

I definitely agree that there are some major things missing in all modeling
programs, which is why I'm putting together a "Master Wish List" of
modeler's desires.  If you have things that you would like to be able to
model, things you'd like to be able to model more easily, or things that you
can do that you feel are very important, please send me your list.  I
currently have contact info for about 10 people representing various
simulation programs who want to know what we want!  Now's our chance to have
some input!

Joe, thanks for shedding some light on the acceptance criteria and how
it compares to other approaches.
 
It is truly a shame that eQUEST has not been approved yet. I do not
know what the hold up is but I believe the program was submitted years
ago to DOE for acceptance. VisualDOE was accepted a couple of months
after its application was submitted. It makes you wonder what DOE 2.2 is
missing that DOE 2.1E has. Better submittal documentation?
 
eQUEST is probably the most widely used program for performing
simulation analysis in the U.S. With our current administration's
initiative to promote an energy-efficient economy and have Federal
Buildings achieve 30% better performance than 90.1-2004, it is
inconsistent that this program is not fast-tracked for acceptance. With
construction costs climbing dramatically, these tax incentives could go
a long way to help achieve what they were designed for - promoting
energy efficient buildings in the U.S. 
 
If anyone on BLDG-SIM can provide insights into why eQUEST has not been
accepted, please share this with the rest of us. And if no explanation
can be provided, perhaps we can use our BLDG-SIM critical mass to
encourage DOE and/or the software developers to push this through the
acceptance process.

I frankly don't understand the criteria of acceptance for software 
approval.  It seems to accept any program that's self-described as 
capable of dynamic simulations with time-varying inputs and outputs,
and 
has gone through the ASHRAE/ANSI Standard 140 comparisons. But Standard

140 is just a cross-program comparison for very simplified cases, sort

of digital hot-box experiments, if you will.  Does this mean that all 
simulations done with these programs are valid and credible ?  Any
DOE-2 
simulation ? Any EnergyPlus simulation ? Of course not.  It's all in
the 
inputs, and if the inputs or modeling are faulty, the results could be

all over the map.   If we compare this criteria of acceptance to 
California's Title-24 Certification of compliance programs, the 
approaches are almost completely opposite.  Here, the criteria are 
whether the programs have the right fundamentals or "intentions" ; 
there, the criteria are whether the programs give the right results.  
I'm afraid we're leaving the barn door open for a lot of questionable 
claims backed up by the use (or abuse) of supposedly approved
software.

I second that motion.

I am probably going to switch simulation tools just because of eQuest?s unapproved status.

These incentives are important to our clients.

The question is who can reach out and touch Dr. Chu, our new energy czar,
who arrived in DC from Berkeley?  A call or visit to the right office from
him will result in fast track review.

While I absolutely disagree with the one stop solution of LBL and some
others (basically, white is it) for many reasons and see the damage that
actually results in some locales to property and the environment and the
increased energy costs resulting from it I sure would support Hashem or
someone from his institution making the call about this approval :-).

Thanks,

Andy Hoover

I second that motion.

I am probably going to switch simulation tools just because of eQuest's
unapproved status.

These incentives are important to our clients.

Joe, thanks for shedding some light on the acceptance criteria and how it
compares to other approaches.

 

It is truly a shame that eQUEST has not been approved yet. I do not know
what the hold up is but I believe the program was submitted years ago to DOE
for acceptance. VisualDOE was accepted a couple of months after its
application was submitted. It makes you wonder what DOE 2.2 is missing that
DOE 2.1E has. Better submittal documentation?

 

eQUEST is probably the most widely used program for performing simulation
analysis in the U.S. With our current administration's initiative to promote
an energy-efficient economy and have Federal Buildings achieve 30% better
performance than 90.1-2004, it is inconsistent that this program is not
fast-tracked for acceptance. With construction costs climbing dramatically,
these tax incentives could go a long way to help achieve what they were
designed for - promoting energy efficient buildings in the U.S. 

 

If anyone on BLDG-SIM can provide insights into why eQUEST has not been
accepted, please share this with the rest of us. And if no explanation can
be provided, perhaps we can use our BLDG-SIM critical mass to encourage DOE
and/or the software developers to push this through the acceptance process.

I frankly don't understand the criteria of acceptance for software 
approval.  It seems to accept any program that's self-described as 
capable of dynamic simulations with time-varying inputs and outputs, and 
has gone through the ASHRAE/ANSI Standard 140 comparisons. But Standard 
140 is just a cross-program comparison for very simplified cases, sort 
of digital hot-box experiments, if you will.  Does this mean that all 
simulations done with these programs are valid and credible ?  Any DOE-2 
simulation ? Any EnergyPlus simulation ? Of course not.  It's all in the 
inputs, and if the inputs or modeling are faulty, the results could be 
all over the map.   If we compare this criteria of acceptance to 
California's Title-24 Certification of compliance programs, the 
approaches are almost completely opposite.  Here, the criteria are 
whether the programs have the right fundamentals or "intentions" ; 
there, the criteria are whether the programs give the right results.  
I'm afraid we're leaving the barn door open for a lot of questionable 
claims backed up by the use (or abuse) of supposedly approved software.

Keep in mind:
  1) those others are profitable software, eQuest is free. 
  2) EPACT05 was originally a 2 year program...and they didn't even 
figure out how to regulate the modeling until it was half over.  Only 
recently did it start to make sense to have it approved.

I asked the eQuest big cheese back in October...here was his reply:


We are looking into re-doing (updating) the last submission package 
(which was done
with the previous version of ASHRAE 140 but not submitted before the std 
was updated
this not able to be actually submitted)

    Hi Jeff,

    Is there something we can do to help get it approved?  Looks like we
    have another 5 years of EPACT tax deductions to figure out.

Any tool that has the required documentation is reviewed promptly by DOE and the results posted if the tool meets the qualification requirements. No documentation for eQuest has been submitted to DOE to date.

This is a good discussion.

Just a question, if eQuest is DOE 2.1E (which has been accepted) but  
with bug fixes and enhancements, why wouldn't it already be accepted,  
or acceptable? What documentation needs to be submitted?  I'm not  
understanding this discussion I guess. Are we not splitting hairs?

Another area I don't understand is why anybody is still using DOE2.1E,  
if DOE2.2 corrected many known errors present in DOE2.1E???

Maybe part of the reason eQuest is not being submitted/approved/ 
upgraded is lack of funding. I have never understood why the eQuest  
program is strictly tied to receiving funding only from the California  
energy commission.

Like Ellen said, eQuest is one of the most widely used energy analysis  
programs in the US. We use it because it works for the production  
environment we work in (which does not allow for runtimes of hours).   
It's fast, very capable, accurate, & enables us to generate acceptable  
results for 99% of our projects while staying within our cost budgets.  
Whatever we can't do in eQuest, we can generally do with Excel  
supplementing.

That said, the program could use some upgrades.  I'm guessing that  
there are users out here like myself that would gladly pay a general  
users fee if it meant getting upgrades to the program.  Upgrades that  
are relevant to the user base and delivered in a more timely fashion.  
I'm saying I don't understand why the funding has to come only from  
California Energy Cx. Not saying that the CEC funding isn't  
appreciated, but that alternative funding by the general users at  
large could allow more features to be integrated into the program.  
Currently, the features that get upgraded into the program are  
determined by the CEC and their limited funding. This is why important  
features such as exhaust air energy recovery for dedicated outdoor air  
systems are missing.

Appreciate any follow up thoughts by anybody.

Thanks everyone for the interesting discussion. I wanted to get to the bottom of the actual software requirements, so I dug around on the IRS website and found the following info (http://www.irs.gov/irb/2008-14_IRB/ar12.html#d0e4028). From what I can tell, equest meets all of the requirements below. It would seem as Drury said no one has submitted the documentation to the DOE for approval. This has huge implications for anybody involved in this business.

.01 In General. The Department of Energy creates and maintains a public list of software that may be used to calculate energy and power consumption and costs for purposes of providing a certification under section 4 of Notice 2006-52. This public list appears at http://www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/info/tax_incentives.html. Soft- ware will be included on the list if the software developer submits the following information to the Department of Energy: 

(1) The name, address, and (if applicable) web site of the software developer; 

(2) The name, email address, and telephone number of the person to contact for further information regarding the software; 

(3) The name, version, or other identifier of the software as it will appear on the list; 

(4) All test results, input files, output files, weather data, modeler reports, and the executable version of the software with which the tests were conducted; and 

(5) A declaration by the developer of the software made under penalties of perjury and containing all of the following information: 

(a) A statement that the software has been tested according to the American National Standards Institute/American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ANSI/ASHRAE) Standard 140-2007 Standard Method of Test for the Evaluation of Building Energy Analysis Computer Programs. 

(b) A statement that the software can model explicitly?

(i) 8,760 hours per year;

(ii) Calculation methodologies for the building components being modeled; 

(iii) Hourly variations in occupancy, lighting power, miscellaneous equipment power, thermostat setpoints, and HVAC system operation, defined separately for each day of the week and holidays; 

(iv) Thermal mass effects;

(v) Ten or more thermal zones;

(vi) Part-load performance curves for mechanical equipment;

(vii) Capacity and efficiency correction curves for mechanical heating and cooling equipment; and 

(viii) Air-side and water-side economizers with integrated control.

(c) A statement that the software can explicitly model each of the following HVAC systems listed in Appendix G of Standard 90.1-2004: 

(i) Packaged Terminal Air Conditioner (PTAC) (air source), single-zone package (through the wall), multi-zone hydronic loop, air-to-air DX coil cooling, central boiler, hot water coil. 

(ii) Packaged Terminal Heat Pump (PTHP) (air source), single-zone package (through the wall), air-to-air DX coil heat/cool. 

(iii) Packaged Single Zone Air Conditioner (PSZ-AC), single-zone air, air-to-air DX coil cool, gas coil, constant-speed fan. 

(iv) Packaged Single Zone Heat Pump (PSZ-HP), single-zone air, air-to-air DX coil cool/heat, constant-speed fan. 

(v) Packaged Variable-Air-Volume (PVAV) with reheat, multi-zone air; multi-zone hydronic loop, air-to-air DX coil, VAV fan, boiler, hot water VAV terminal boxes. 

(vi) Packaged Variable-Air-Volume with parallel fan powered boxes (PVAV with PFP boxes), multi-zone air, DX coil, VAV fan, fan-powered induction boxes, electric reheat. 

(vii) Variable-Air-Volume (VAV) with reheat, multi-zone air, multi-zone hydronic loop, air-handling unit, chilled water coil, hot water coil, VAV fan, chiller, boiler, hot water VAV boxes. 

(viii) Variable-Air-Volume with parallel fan powered boxes (VAV with PFP boxes), multi-zone air, air-handling unit, chilled water coil, hot water coil, VAV fan, chiller, fan-powered induction boxes, electric reheat. 

(d) A statement that the software can?

(i) Either directly determine energy and power costs or produce hourly reports of energy use by energy source suitable for determining energy and power costs separately; and 

(ii) Design load calculations to determine required HVAC equipment capacities and air and water flow rates. 

(e) A statement describing which, if any, of the following the software can explicitly model: 

(i) Natural ventilation.

(ii) Mixed mode (natural and mechanical) ventilation.

(iii) Earth tempering of outdoor air.

(iv) Displacement ventilation.

(v) Evaporative cooling.

(vi) Water use by occupants for cooking, cleaning or other domestic uses. 

(vii) Water use by heating, cooling, or other equipment, or for on-site landscaping. 

(viii) Automatic interior or exterior lighting controls (such as occupancy, photocells, or time clocks). 

(viii) Daylighting (sidelighting, skylights, or tubular daylight devices). 

(ix) Improved fan system efficiency through static pressure reset. 

(x) Radiant heating or cooling (low or high temperature).

(xi) Multiple or variable speed control for fans, cooling equipment, or cooling towers. 

(xii) On-site energy systems (such as combined heat and power systems, fuel cells, solar photovoltaic, solar thermal, or wind).

This is a good discussion.

 

Just a question, if eQuest is DOE 2.1E (which has been accepted) but with bug fixes and enhancements, why wouldn't it already be accepted, or acceptable? What documentation needs to be submitted?  I'm not understanding this discussion I guess. Are we not splitting hairs?

 

Another area I don't understand is why anybody is still using DOE2.1E, if DOE2.2 corrected many known errors present in DOE2.1E??? 

 

Maybe part of the reason eQuest is not being submitted/approved/upgraded is lack of funding. I have never understood why the eQuest program is strictly tied to receiving funding only from the California energy commission.

 

Like Ellen said, eQuest is one of the most widely used energy analysis programs in the US. We use it because it works for the production environment we work in (which does not allow for runtimes of hours).  It's fast, very capable, accurate, & enables us to generate acceptable results for 99% of our projects while staying within our cost budgets. Whatever we can't do in eQuest, we can generally do with Excel supplementing.  

 

That said, the program could use some upgrades.  I'm guessing that there are users out here like myself that would gladly pay a general users fee if it meant getting upgrades to the program.

Not saying that the CEC funding isn't appreciated, but that alternative funding by the general users at large could allow more features to be integrated into the program. Currently, the features that get upgraded into the program are determined by the CEC and their limited funding. This is why important features such as exhaust air energy recovery for dedicated outdoor air systems are missing.  

 

Appreciate any follow up thoughts by anybody.

	Joe, thanks for shedding some light on the acceptance criteria and how it compares to other approaches.

	 

	It is truly a shame that eQUEST has not been approved yet. I do not know what the hold up is but I believe the program was submitted years ago to DOE for acceptance. VisualDOE was accepted a couple of months after its application was submitted. It makes you wonder what DOE 2.2 is missing that DOE 2.1E has. Better submittal documentation?

	 

	eQUEST is probably the most widely used program for performing simulation analysis in the U.S. With our current administration's initiative to promote an energy-efficient economy and have Federal Buildings achieve 30% better performance than 90.1-2004, it is inconsistent that this program is not fast-tracked for acceptance. With construction costs climbing dramatically, these tax incentives could go a long way to help achieve what they were designed for - promoting energy efficient buildings in the U.S. 

	 

	If anyone on BLDG-SIM can provide insights into why eQUEST has not been accepted, please share this with the rest of us. And if no explanation can be provided, perhaps we can use our BLDG-SIM critical mass to encourage DOE and/or the software developers to push this through the acceptance process.

Probably a silly question, but can one of US submit eQuest for approval?

Does it have to come from the developers?

Thanks everyone for the interesting discussion. I wanted to get to the bottom of the actual software requirements, so I dug around on the IRS website and found the following info (http://www.irs.gov/irb/2008-14_IRB/ar12.html#d0e4028). From what I can tell, equest meets all of the requirements below. It would seem as Drury said no one has submitted the documentation to the DOE for approval. This has huge implications for anybody involved in this business.

.01 In General. The Department of Energy creates and maintains a public list of software that may be used to calculate energy and power consumption and costs for purposes of providing a certification under section 4 of Notice 2006-52. This public list appears at http://www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/info/tax_incentives.html. Soft- ware will be included on the list if the software developer submits the following information to the Department of Energy: 

(1) The name, address, and (if applicable) web site of the software developer; 

(2) The name, email address, and telephone number of the person to contact for further information regarding the software; 

(3) The name, version, or other identifier of the software as it will appear on the list;

This is a good discussion.

 

Just a question, if eQuest is DOE 2.1E (which has been accepted) but with bug fixes and enhancements, why wouldn't it already be accepted, or acceptable? What documentation needs to be submitted?  I'm not understanding this discussion I guess. Are we not splitting hairs?

 

Another area I don't understand is why anybody is still using DOE2.1E, if DOE2.2 corrected many known errors present in DOE2.1E??? 

 

Maybe part of the reason eQuest is not being submitted/approved/upgraded is lack of funding. I have never understood why the eQuest program is strictly tied to receiving funding only from the California energy commission.

 

Like Ellen said, eQuest is one of the most widely used energy analysis programs in the US. We use it because it works for the production environment we work in (which does not allow for runtimes of hours).  It's fast, very capable, accurate, & enables us to generate acceptable results for 99% of our projects while staying within our cost budgets. Whatever we can't do in eQuest, we can generally do with Excel supplementing.  

 

That said, the program could use some upgrades.  I'm guessing that there are users out here like myself that would gladly pay a general users fee if it meant getting upgrades to the program.  Upgrades that are relevant to the user base and delivered in a more timely fashion. I'm saying I don't understand why the funding has to come only from California Energy Cx. Not saying that the CEC funding isn't appreciated, but that alternative funding by the general users at large could allow more features to be integrated into the program. Currently, the features that get upgraded into the program are determined by the CEC and their limited funding. This is why important features such as exhaust air energy recovery for dedicated outdoor air systems are missing.  

 

Appreciate any follow up thoughts by anybody.

Joe, thanks for shedding some light on the acceptance criteria and how it compares to other approaches.

 

It is truly a shame that eQUEST has not been approved yet. I do not know what the hold up is but I believe the program was submitted years ago to DOE for acceptance. VisualDOE was accepted a couple of months after its application was submitted. It makes you wonder what DOE 2.2 is missing that DOE 2.1E has. Better submittal documentation?

 

eQUEST is probably the most widely used program for performing simulation analysis in the U.S. With our current administration's initiative to promote an energy-efficient economy and have Federal Buildings achieve 30% better performance than 90.1-2004, it is inconsistent that this program is not fast-tracked for acceptance. With construction costs climbing dramatically, these tax incentives could go a long way to help achieve what they were designed for - promoting energy efficient buildings in the U.S. 

 

If anyone on BLDG-SIM can provide insights into why eQUEST has not been accepted, please share this with the rest of us. And if no explanation can be provided, perhaps we can use our BLDG-SIM critical mass to encourage DOE and/or the software developers to push this through the acceptance process.

I frankly don't understand the criteria of acceptance for software 
approval.  It seems to accept any program that's self-described as 
capable of dynamic simulations with time-varying inputs and outputs, and 
has gone through the ASHRAE/ANSI Standard 140 comparisons. But Standard 
140 is just a cross-program comparison for very simplified cases, sort 
of digital hot-box experiments, if you will.  Does this mean that all 
simulations done with these programs are valid and credible ?  Any DOE-2 
simulation ? Any EnergyPlus simulation ? Of course not.  It's all in the 
inputs, and if the inputs or modeling are faulty, the results could be 
all over the map.   If we compare this criteria of acceptance to 
California's Title-24 Certification of compliance programs, the 
approaches are almost completely opposite.  Here, the criteria are 
whether the programs have the right fundamentals or "intentions" ; 
there, the criteria are whether the programs give the right results.  
I'm afraid we're leaving the barn door open for a lot of questionable 
claims backed up by the use (or abuse) of supposedly approved software.

Karen and all,

 

I'm confused here....how can a program that takes up to 3 hours to rename
the zones but then takes minutes to get results, be better than something
that takes a few minutes to rename, but then takes a couple of hours to run?
They are about the same surely?  The only advantage I can see is that
further iteration might be quicker in the former assuming your geometry
doesn't change.

 

I have been using various modelling tools such as IES VE, TAS and
DesignBuilder as well as a few other tools when necessary (Fluent & CHAM CFD
etc) since the late 90s.   IES is good, it's quick to produce models and
excellent for dynamic natural ventilation design.  TAS is better at the HVAC
and natural ventilation design aspects than IES and I think it's more
accurate, but it's front end still lacks some of the functionality of other
tools.  Hopefully that is being addressed by their links with Bentley.  My
colleague, Chris Yates (also on this list) has become a bit of a wiz with
the sketchup plug in for IES and this appears to be much better than relying
on the gbxml output of revit.  

 

DesignBuilder is the tool that I use most now in both SBEM (UK regulations
format) and EnergyPlus for dynamic modelling.  It takes a lot of the best
features of both IES and TAS and then adds some other nice touches in terms
of data application to speed up the process of setting up your models.  The
only sticking point with it is that EnergyPlus is painfully slow.  The main
thing I'd like is for that to be changed and improved.  Carrying out
simulations with all the lighting controls and calculated natural
ventilation turned on for buildings with over 100 zones is nigh on
impossible as I don't fancy leaving it running for a week or two.  I have to
carry out major sub-division of models or calculate individual zones then
schedule up the vent based on those results or just go with scheduled vent.
Thankfully the reporting methodology from DesignBuilder is pretty good,
though I have to admit I quite like some of the report wizard output by
equest.

 

The main advantage of the commercial tools as opposed to the free tools such
as DOE and equest, is that they use an interactive 3d model to input the
building and that you can interrogate much more easily for post-processing.
This means you gain an understanding of the building form much more easily
and many link with other tools for further analysis.  I like some of what
equest has to offer, but I much prefer the interactive model building tools
that IES, TAS and DeisgnBuilder offer.  They just make it...easier...and
generally quicker and more efficient when you consider the other studies
that you can do (e.g daylighting, CFD, etc).

 

In terms of asking for changes -  having worked for IES (and with many other
developers), the stock answer even to their own team was...yes it's on the
list.   My guess is that will still be the same.

Paul

Varkie,

I disagree with your statement that eQuest is not appropriate for large
buildings because you can't change space names to match architectural names
in wizard mode, and the inputs created from the wizard aren't appropriate
for all spaces.  The wizards are called "Schematic Design Wizard" and
"Design Development Wizard" for a reason.  They aren't desinged for detail,
they're designed to help you make big design decisions quickly.  If you want
the building to be modeled as closely as possible to the final design, this
takes some extra work.  Yeah, re-naming spaces is a pain, but at 5 seconds
per space, re-naming 1,000 spaces takes about 1.5 hours, well worth the
effort.  If you re-name zones too, maybe it's 3 hours total.

Yeah, some things about eQuest are clumsy, like why does it create one
underground wall (and floor) consturction for each surface, when only 4-5
are needed for the whole model?  Why does it re-create occupancy, lighting
and micellaneous equipment schedules for each shell, even if the use is the
same?  And why does it create tons of duplicate infiltration schedules?
BUT... this takes an hour or two to clean up, and then you have a decently
flexible model that gives you reasonable results in a matter of minutes.
Versus a program that takes 1-2 hours to run.  I've done a few LEED projects
in Trace700 and it's painful modeling a design case and four (rotated) base
cases at 1-2 hours each, especially if you then find you've left anything
out.

I definitely agree that there are some major things missing in all modeling
programs, which is why I'm putting together a "Master Wish List" of
modeler's desires.  If you have things that you would like to be able to
model, things you'd like to be able to model more easily, or things that you
can do that you feel are very important, please send me your list.  I
currently have contact info for about 10 people representing various
simulation programs who want to know what we want!  Now's our chance to have
some input!

Graham,

The comment below stands out which might also be the reason for not using
EnergyPlus on large projects.

- DOE-2.2 runs much quicker.  For comparable 30,000 m2 buildings I would say
DOE-2 runs in 1 minute and IES VE with an APhvac network probably 1-2 hours.
If you through in Macroflo it probably adds another hour of simulation time.
As a result iterative trial and error debugging has to be done on a 1-2 week
period.

Large building projects (1 to 10 million sqft) with up to 1,000 zones and 70
systems ranging in size from 10,000 to 200,000 cfm (pardon the English units
- the USA & the Bahamas are not going to switch to metric) require several
iterative runs to get the input errors fixed.  Breaking up the project into
small pieces is not a solution since it affects demand costs, central plants
and other components.  I have worked on such projects using DOE2.1E and
TRACE600/700.  

eQUEST is not suitable for such projects either.  One of its limitations is
that you cannot enter the space names shown on architectural drawings.
Others include assuming all the input data and making all the decisions for
you when you enter the type of building.  1000 zones means 1000 infiltration
schedules and multiples of other building components. It is unrealistic to
check all the input created by eQUEST for errors. Fixing everything to match
the exact project data has to be done in detailed edit.  Detailed edit means
you lose access to the graphical method of creating the building model from
AutoCAD drawings which is the main benefit of this program.

Hi Duke,

It has to come from the developer. I am actually trying to get this 
started by getting the effort funded and by working with the developers. 
I have their cooperation so far so I hope it's just a matter of time.

Cheers,

It can be better because you only have to do the renaming process once 
and then your done whereas you are going to have to do the rerunning way 
more than once: at least 4 orientation runs, a run for each energy 
efficiency measure, a run each time you realize you forgot to do the 
____(fill it in). You are way further ahead using eQUEST. I'm not sure 
what you mean by an interactive 3D viewer, I find eQUEST's 3D views 
really helpful but I get the impression you are talking about something 
else. At any rate, I have used IESVE and E+ and I think they both excel 
in ways that eQUEST doesn't but IESVE is just too expensive for a single 
shop person like me and E+ is just too slow so far. I don't rule them 
out for use when I'm rich and they're faster, though.

Message-ID: <9bf8eb3b0902261015u4fee76a7n95511e20833dce90@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am working on a base case energy simulation model using Visual DOE.
As per ASHRAE 90.1-2004, for this building it's a Centrifugal chiller
What curves are used for the base case centrifugal chiller? Does ASHRAE
90.1-2004 specify the performance curve for the  chillers?

Thanks & Regards,

Any tool that has the required documentation is reviewed promptly by DOE
and the results posted if the tool meets the qualification requirements.
No documentation for eQuest has been submitted to DOE to date.

Joe, thanks for shedding some light on the acceptance criteria and how
it compares to other approaches.

 

It is truly a shame that eQUEST has not been approved yet. I do not know
what the hold up is but I believe the program was submitted years ago to
DOE for acceptance. VisualDOE was accepted a couple of months after its
application was submitted. It makes you wonder what DOE 2.2 is missing
that DOE 2.1E has. Better submittal documentation?

 

eQUEST is probably the most widely used program for performing
simulation analysis in the U.S. With our current administration's
initiative to promote an energy-efficient economy and have Federal
Buildings achieve 30% better performance than 90.1-2004, it is
inconsistent that this program is not fast-tracked for acceptance. With
construction costs climbing dramatically, these tax incentives could go
a long way to help achieve what they were designed for - promoting
energy efficient buildings in the U.S. 

 

If anyone on BLDG-SIM can provide insights into why eQUEST has not been
accepted, please share this with the rest of us. And if no explanation
can be provided, perhaps we can use our BLDG-SIM critical mass to
encourage DOE and/or the software developers to push this through the
acceptance process.

I frankly don't understand the criteria of acceptance for software 
approval.  It seems to accept any program that's self-described as 
capable of dynamic simulations with time-varying inputs and outputs, and

has gone through the ASHRAE/ANSI Standard 140 comparisons. But Standard 
140 is just a cross-program comparison for very simplified cases, sort 
of digital hot-box experiments, if you will.  Does this mean that all 
simulations done with these programs are valid and credible ?  Any DOE-2

simulation ? Any EnergyPlus simulation ? Of course not.  It's all in the

inputs, and if the inputs or modeling are faulty, the results could be 
all over the map.   If we compare this criteria of acceptance to 
California's Title-24 Certification of compliance programs, the 
approaches are almost completely opposite.  Here, the criteria are 
whether the programs have the right fundamentals or "intentions" ; 
there, the criteria are whether the programs give the right results.  
I'm afraid we're leaving the barn door open for a lot of questionable 
claims backed up by the use (or abuse) of supposedly approved software.

Carol said most of it, and I definitely second the prohibitive cost for a
program like IES-VE for a small shop, but I've used Trace700, which I assume
uses an iterative algorithm (it took about 1-2 hours run-time).  So maybe
using an iterative algorithm gives a little more accuracy, I'd guess on the
order of 2-5%, BUT many of these programs don't allow you the flexibility in
your inputs to take advantage of the iterative nature of the program.  For
many systems, you don't need to use an iterative program, you just need to
know the hourly space loads, hourly ventilation loads, and equipment
operation efficiencies at the given conditions.  You need just a few layers:
component load (walls, windows, internal loads, etc), zone loads, hvac
system loads, loop loads and plant loads, in order to get pretty good
results.  You need a few additional levels when your systems get more
compliated, but it doesn't require a super-complicated algorithm.

Bottom line is, many programs have their drawbacks.  eQuest is not good at
modeling natural ventilation, precisely because it is not a CFD program.  If
it were good at modeling natural ventilation, it wouldn't be able to run in
1-2 minutes.

I'd love to see a program that could integrate into two simulation engines,
one quick engine for trouble-shooting, doing DD models and running lots of
alternatives, and then an interative simulation engine for more complex
stuff, natural ventilation, complicated HVAC system configurations, etc.
Add that one to the wish-list!  Maybe we'll see it in 20 years.

Just following the last sentence of Karen's massage: "Maybe we'll see it in 20 years..."

The waiting period may be shorten if more bright, innovative, and hard working people take the gun from the veterans and work around the clock to create the virtual reality of the buildings, mechanical systems, and even the behavior of occupants... It is definitely hard work! I guess, unless this hard work can be rewarded in some way, we still have to endure with the slow pace, or even slower pace due to the aging factor, of the development of energy analysis software.

Carol said most of it, and I definitely second the prohibitive cost for a program like IES-VE for a small shop, but I've used Trace700, which I assume uses an iterative algorithm (it took about 1-2 hours run-time).  So maybe using an iterative algorithm gives a little more accuracy, I'd guess on the order of 2-5%, BUT many of these programs don't allow you the flexibility in your inputs to take advantage of the iterative nature of the program.  For many systems, you don't need to use an iterative program, you just need to know the hourly space loads, hourly ventilation loads, and equipment operation efficiencies at the given conditions.  You need just a few layers: component load (walls, windows, internal loads, etc), zone loads, hvac system loads, loop loads and plant loads, in order to get pretty good results.  You need a few additional levels when your systems get more compliated, but it doesn't require a super-complicated algorithm.

Bottom line is, many programs have their drawbacks.  eQuest is not good at modeling natural ventilation, precisely because it is not a CFD program.  If it were good at modeling natural ventilation, it wouldn't be able to run in 1-2 minutes.

I'd love to see a program that could integrate into two simulation engines, one quick engine for trouble-shooting, doing DD models and running lots of alternatives, and then an interative simulation engine for more complex stuff, natural ventilation, complicated HVAC system configurations, etc.  Add that one to the wish-list!  Maybe we'll see it in 20 years.

At any rate, I have used IESVE and E+ and I think they both excel in ways that eQUEST doesn't but IESVE is just too expensive for a single shop person like me and E+ is just too slow so far. I don't rule them out for use when I'm rich and they're faster, though.

Karen and all,

I?m confused here....how can a program that takes up to 3 hours to rename the zones but then takes minutes to get results, be better than something that takes a few minutes to rename, but then takes a couple of hours to run? They are about the same surely? The only advantage I can see is that further iteration might be quicker in the former assuming your geometry doesn?t change.

I have been using various modelling tools such as IES VE, TAS and DesignBuilder as well as a few other tools when necessary (Fluent & CHAM CFD etc) since the late 90s. IES is good, it?s quick to produce models and excellent for dynamic natural ventilation design. TAS is better at the HVAC and natural ventilation design aspects than IES and I think it?s more accurate, but it?s front end still lacks some of the functionality of other tools. Hopefully that is being addressed by their links with Bentley. My colleague, Chris Yates (also on this list) has become a bit of a wiz with the sketchup plug in for IES and this appears to be much better than relying on the gbxml output of revit.

DesignBuilder is the tool that I use most now in both SBEM (UK regulations format) and EnergyPlus for dynamic modelling. It takes a lot of the best features of both IES and TAS and then adds some other nice touches in terms of data application to speed up the process of setting up your models. The only sticking point with it is that EnergyPlus is painfully slow. The main thing I?d like is for that to be changed and improved. Carrying out simulations with all the lighting controls and calculated natural ventilation turned on for buildings with over 100 zones is nigh on impossible as I don?t fancy leaving it running for a week or two. I have to carry out major sub-division of models or calculate individual zones then schedule up the vent based on those results or just go with scheduled vent. Thankfully the reporting methodology from DesignBuilder is pretty good, though I have to admit I quite like some of the report wizard output by equest.

The main advantage of the commercial tools as opposed to the free tools such as DOE and equest, is that they use an interactive 3d model to input the building and that you can interrogate much more easily for post-processing. This means you gain an understanding of the building form much more easily and many link with other tools for further analysis. I like some of what equest has to offer, but I much prefer the interactive model building tools that IES, TAS and DeisgnBuilder offer. They just make it...easier...and generally quicker and more efficient when you consider the other studies that you can do (e.g daylighting, CFD, etc).

In terms of asking for changes ? having worked for IES (and with many other developers), the stock answer even to their own team was...yes it?s on the list. My guess is that will still be the same.

Varkie,

I disagree with your statement that eQuest is not appropriate for large buildings because you can't change space names to match architectural names in wizard mode, and the inputs created from the wizard aren't appropriate for all spaces. The wizards are called "Schematic Design Wizard" and "Design Development Wizard" for a reason. They aren't desinged for detail, they're designed to help you make big design decisions quickly. If you want the building to be modeled as closely as possible to the final design, this takes some extra work. Yeah, re-naming spaces is a pain, but at 5 seconds per space, re-naming 1,000 spaces takes about 1.5 hours, well worth the effort. If you re-name zones too, maybe it's 3 hours total.

Yeah, some things about eQuest are clumsy, like why does it create one underground wall (and floor) consturction for each surface, when only 4-5 are needed for the whole model? Why does it re-create occupancy, lighting and micellaneous equipment schedules for each shell, even if the use is the same? And why does it create tons of duplicate infiltration schedules? BUT... this takes an hour or two to clean up, and then you have a decently flexible model that gives you reasonable results in a matter of minutes. Versus a program that takes 1-2 hours to run. I've done a few LEED projects in Trace700 and it's painful modeling a design case and four (rotated) base cases at 1-2 hours each, especially if you then find you've left anything out.

I definitely agree that there are some major things missing in all modeling programs, which is why I'm putting together a "Master Wish List" of modeler's desires. If you have things that you would like to be able to model, things you'd like to be able to model more easily, or things that you can do that you feel are very important, please send me your list. I currently have contact info for about 10 people representing various simulation programs who want to know what we want! Now's our chance to have some input!

Graham,

The comment below stands out which might also be the reason for not using EnergyPlus on large projects.

- DOE-2.2 runs much quicker. For comparable 30,000 m2 buildings I would say DOE-2 runs in 1 minute and IES VE with an APhvac network probably 1-2 hours. If you through in Macroflo it probably adds another hour of simulation time. As a result *iterative trial and error debugging* has to be done on a 1-2 week period.

Large building projects (1 to 10 million sqft) with up to 1,000 zones and 70 systems ranging in size from 10,000 to 200,000 cfm (pardon the English units - the USA & the Bahamas are not going to switch to metric) require several iterative runs to get the input errors fixed. Breaking up the project into small pieces is not a solution since it affects demand costs, central plants and other components. I have worked on such projects using DOE2.1E and TRACE600/700.

eQUEST is not suitable for such projects either. One of its limitations is that you cannot enter the space names shown on architectural drawings. Others include assuming all the input data and making all the decisions for you when you enter the type of building. 1000 zones means 1000 infiltration schedules and multiples of other building components. It is unrealistic to check all the input created by eQUEST for errors. Fixing everything to match the exact project data has to be done in detailed edit. Detailed edit means you lose access to the graphical method of creating the building model from AutoCAD drawings which is the main benefit of this program.

On the modeling of natural ventilation, I've not heard of anyone who's 
coupled thermal with CFD for annual simulations, and if they did I'd 
guess they're still waiting for the results!  There are, however, 
several programs (EnergyPlus, ESPr) that do link up with a multi-zone 
air-flow network program (EnergyPlus uses AirNET/CONTAM)  to  "ping 
pong" with the thermal
program.  My experience doing an earlier linking of COMIS into 
EnergyPlus showed increases in runtimes of  2-3 times (that's on top of 
the standard run times most people have seen). I also saw instabilities 
in the "ping pong" approach that made me think of more iterations 
(horrors!), but the funding got cut so I didn't pursue that.

As for eQuest handling of natural ventilation, its capabilities are 
probably the same as DOE-2.1E,  which does have a very simple one-zone 
natural ventilation model that would calculate outside air flow rates 
based on that zone's leakage are, outside temperature, and wind speed. 
This capability was available first only in the RESYS system, but later 
extended to the other systems. I wouldn't use it to design a commercial 
building with hybrid ventilation, but for rough estimates of natural 
ventilation potentials for operable windows in perimeter offices, how 
bad is it ?  Another nice thing about this natural ventilation feature 
in DOE-2 is that DOE-2 Systems first checks to see if NV can hold the 
setpoint temperature, and if not, it shuts off NV and turns on the 
mechanical system.  Voila!  The ideal natural ventilation control.  I've 
yet to see such a control available in other programs.

So, I get a little impatient when people talk about the capabilities of 
different programs in a yes-no context.

Dear all,


I am writing to you to ask for your personal preference on which CFD
software package I should use for all the following (as one) and your
reason why;
A) Large Scale City Analysis of wind turbulence and velocity
B) Internal and external analysis (combined)
C) CFD for Urban Design.

Currently we use IES-VE for CFD analysis but from what I've heard, the
general consensus is that, it may not be near accurate enough. In
addition, the computational time is far too long.

James and Ellen suggest that eQuest is one of the most widely used energy
analysis programs in the US.  I'm interested in getting hold of the user
numbers.  Could Ellen or James (or another Bldg-Sim-ist) provide a
reference?  Thanks!

This is a good discussion.

Just a question, if eQuest is DOE 2.1E (which has been accepted) but with
bug fixes and enhancements, why wouldn't it already be accepted, or
acceptable? What documentation needs to be submitted?  I'm not understanding
this discussion I guess. Are we not splitting hairs?

Another area I don't understand is why anybody is still using DOE2.1E, if
DOE2.2 corrected many known errors present in DOE2.1E??? 

Maybe part of the reason eQuest is not being submitted/approved/upgraded is
lack of funding. I have never understood why the eQuest program is strictly
tied to receiving funding only from the California energy commission.

Like Ellen said, eQuest is one of the most widely used energy analysis
programs in the US. We use it because it works for the production
environment we work in (which does not allow for runtimes of hours).  It's
fast, very capable, accurate, & enables us to generate acceptable results
for 99% of our projects while staying within our cost budgets. Whatever we
can't do in eQuest, we can generally do with Excel supplementing.  

That said, the program could use some upgrades.  I'm guessing that there are
users out here like myself that would gladly pay a general users fee if it
meant getting upgrades to the program.  Upgrades that are relevant to the
user base and delivered in a more timely fashion. I'm saying I don't
understand why the funding has to come only from California Energy Cx. Not
saying that the CEC funding isn't appreciated, but that alternative funding
by the general users at large could allow more features to be integrated
into the program. Currently, the features that get upgraded into the program
are determined by the CEC and their limited funding. This is why important
features such as exhaust air energy recovery for dedicated outdoor air
systems are missing.  

Appreciate any follow up thoughts by anybody.

Joe, thanks for shedding some light on the acceptance criteria and how it
compares to other approaches.
 
It is truly a shame that eQUEST has not been approved yet. I do not know
what the hold up is but I believe the program was submitted years ago to DOE
for acceptance. VisualDOE was accepted a couple of months after its
application was submitted. It makes you wonder what DOE 2.2 is missing that
DOE 2.1E has. Better submittal documentation?
 
eQUEST is probably the most widely used program for performing simulation
analysis in the U.S. With our current administration's initiative to promote
an energy-efficient economy and have Federal Buildings achieve 30% better
performance than 90.1-2004, it is inconsistent that this program is not
fast-tracked for acceptance. With construction costs climbing dramatically,
these tax incentives could go a long way to help achieve what they were
designed for - promoting energy efficient buildings in the U.S. 
 
If anyone on BLDG-SIM can provide insights into why eQUEST has not been
accepted, please share this with the rest of us. And if no explanation can
be provided, perhaps we can use our BLDG-SIM critical mass to encourage DOE
and/or the software developers to push this through the acceptance process.

I frankly don't understand the criteria of acceptance for software 
approval.  It seems to accept any program that's self-described as 
capable of dynamic simulations with time-varying inputs and outputs, and 
has gone through the ASHRAE/ANSI Standard 140 comparisons. But Standard 
140 is just a cross-program comparison for very simplified cases, sort 
of digital hot-box experiments, if you will.  Does this mean that all 
simulations done with these programs are valid and credible ?  Any DOE-2 
simulation ? Any EnergyPlus simulation ? Of course not.  It's all in the 
inputs, and if the inputs or modeling are faulty, the results could be 
all over the map.   If we compare this criteria of acceptance to 
California's Title-24 Certification of compliance programs, the 
approaches are almost completely opposite.  Here, the criteria are 
whether the programs have the right fundamentals or "intentions" ; 
there, the criteria are whether the programs give the right results.  
I'm afraid we're leaving the barn door open for a lot of questionable 
claims backed up by the use (or abuse) of supposedly approved software.

CFD AnalysisHi, Carney
If you want to do those jobs, you'd better to have a cluster or at least a work station to minize the computing time. There are a lot of commercial CFD software which can fulfill your purposes, like FLUENT and PHOENICS etc.. I do not ever try IES-VE though.

Hope this can help.

Dear all, 



I am writing to you to ask for your personal preference on which CFD software package I should use for all the following (as one) and your reason why;

A) Large Scale City Analysis of wind turbulence and velocity 
B) Internal and external analysis (combined) 
C) CFD for Urban Design. 

Currently we use IES-VE for CFD analysis but from what I've heard, the general consensus is that, it may not be near accurate enough. In addition, the computational time is far too long.

We are working on a natural ventilation program, CoolVent, that does 
zonal analysis for multiple zones such as multistory open plan zones 
connected to a central atrium. It simultaneously solves the energy and 
momentum equations for each zone and includes thermal mass effects for 
transient simulations. It is still under development.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] GenOpt 3.0.0 beta2 released
Message-ID: <49A82985.9010400@lbl.gov>

Dear Building Simulation Colleagues,

We are pleased to announce the release of GenOpt 3.0.0 beta2.

GenOpt is an optimization program for the minimization of a cost 
function, such as annual energy use, that is evaluated by a simulation 
program, such as EnergyPlus, TRNSYS, IDA, DOE-2, or any simulation 
program with text-based input and output. GenOpt can also be used to 
automate parametric studies.

GenOpt 3.0.0 will run multiple simulations in parallel. Depending on the 
number of processors that your computer has, GenOpt may start multiple 
simulations simultaneously in order to reduce the computing time for an 
optimization or a parametric study.

For free download and more information, please visit
http://SimulationResearch.lbl.gov/GO

Your sincerely,

Michael Wetter

Leon,

That's very interesting.  I know Jim Axley also worked with George 
Walton a decade or so ago to add heat conduction routines to CONTAM in 
order to simultaneously solve for heat and mass transport.  I don't know 
whatever became of that work, though.
Univ. of Colorado is now working on an ASHRAE project 1456-RP to 
evaluate methods to model natural ventilation, although so far they've 
only looked into coupled techniques, not simultaneous solutions.  Have 
you considered using an existing thermal program for the thermal side of 
the equations ?  I know that would be major surgery, but then you will 
have access to all the
effort that's already done in modeling heat transfer and radiation.

(I'm responding to this only because you had mentioned me by name, 
Ellen  (:-))

My main concern was not whether a specific program or tool has been 
approved (although I can sympathize
with some of the sentiments expressed), but with the lack of rigor in 
the acceptance criteria, which may in the
end bring down the credibility of simulations.   I see the use of 
simulations for ePack as a double-edged sword.
It's a powerful incentive for people to do simulations, but also a ripe 
situation for abusing simulations for
material benefit.

Carney,

I'm also among the group of people who are not too comfortable with CFD
results from tools like IES-VE and Designbuilder. These are primarily energy
modeling tools with built in CFD applications. However they provide a
seamless environment (for Energy modeling and CFD) and have easy to
understand user interface but I feel the main problem is with 'automatic
meshing' that these software offer. Meshing is a critical component of the
CFD process and it would be hard to automatically generate right kind of
mesh for infinite variations of geometry and operating conditions.

To obtain correct CFD results we must check mesh convergence, may be these
tools have algorithm which create very fine mesh to start with and hence
they take a long time to produce results. Improving hardware capacity like
JRR and Zhoulum suggested is essential but its also critical to create right
kind of mesh to get quick results. This is especially critical for building
application since the volume of analysis zone is usually huge, if we mesh it
improperly then we can end up waiting for an year even on 32 machine cluster
or a powerful Xeon server.

In my opinion also stand alone CFD tools like Fluent, Phoenics, CFX, StarCD
etc. are much better CFD tools than IES-VE. Even if you would like to
use IES-VE it would be prudent to test a few cases of your analysis and
compare results with established stand alone CFD tools.

There are also CFD tools specific for building applications like
Fluent-Airpak and Flovent which are customized for building applications.
These tools are easy to understand for building engineers and produce good
results. Another good option can be OpenSource CFD libraries like OpenFoam,
FDS etc. However the problem there is that learning curve with OpenSource
platforms is rather slow.

Shishir

Dear Dr. Huang and Dr. Glicksman:

Yes, the work ended with up a program called CONTAM97R, which can do both onion
and ping-pong type of thermal-air couplings. The program has been used
internally for several projects related to natural/hybrid ventilation. We are
looking for the potential of extending its capability. Besides
Energyplus+Airnet, TRANSYS has a new type to couple with CONTAM too, which is
also under further development. By the way, we have a new version of CONTAM 3.0
with CFD capability, which is under beta testing. Hopefully, the new version
will be released publicly soon.

Thanks,
Leon
