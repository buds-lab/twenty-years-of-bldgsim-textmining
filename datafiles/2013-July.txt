Is there any interest in developing the objectives in Building Energy
Performance Analysis Notes http://bepan.info/
For example: you can achieve percent energy savings for LEED, but ECM's
might make no practical financial sense.
It requires Life Cycle Cost Analysis and a first & operating cost database.
See

4 - Design-Standards Database (To be redeveloped, updated & maintained)
5 - Design-Criteria Database (To be redeveloped, updated & maintained)
6 ? Bldg-Cost-Database for LCCA (To be redeveloped, updated & maintained)

Hi wahid
Try the GBS (Green Building Studio). This is a web service provided by Autodesk that allows you to convert a gbxml file into an eQuest input file.
There are certain rules you need to follow and depends on preparing your revit file like bounding  your spaces so your gbxml file can be translated correctly. This will ultimately depend on the "quality" of your architectural revit file.
I haven't been successful yet in doing so.
If you are, it'll be good to share your findings with the list!

Message-ID: <3FBC99ECC946B340B8598009E790B2181C7B12@EXCHANGE1.cadd_group.ghtltd.com>

Hi everyone,

 

I wanted to do a gut check of whether I'm interpreting ASHRAE 90.1-2007
Section G3.1.3.13 correctly.

 

That section says:

 

G3.1.3.13     VAV Minimum Flow Setpoints (Systems 5 and 7). Minimum
volume setpoints for VAV reheat boxes shall be 0.4 cfm/ft2 of floor area
served or the minimum ventilation rate, whichever is larger.

 

I have a number of System 5s for a warehouse facility with very low
heating/cooling loads.

 

If I set the minimum flow for all zones to 0.4 in this screen, it ends
up substantially over-supplying the baseline zones.

 

 

 

Since there are maximum cooling supply temperatures (60 degrees), I end
up overcooling the zones even at minimum load, so there is reheat.
There is also cooling energy to get the supply temps down to 60.

 

Am I doing anything "wrong"?

 

I seem to be following the requirements of 90.1, just want to make sure
there isn't an exception somewhere that I'm missing.

 

Thanks!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] PhD Studentship: A novel camera-based approach to
 measure daylight exposure for conservation/management of light-sensitive
 objects in heritage buildings
Message-ID: <DDF64A46-B367-4DC1-9A79-5BD4168935B2@lboro.ac.uk>

PhD Studentship: A novel camera-based approach to measure daylight exposure for conservation/management of light-sensitive objects in heritage buildings

Loughborough University - School of Civil and Building Engineering

http://www.jobs.ac.uk/job/AGV407/phd-studentship/

Background to the research
=================

Many heritage buildings contain light sensitive objects, e.g. paintings, fabrics, wallpapers, furnishings etc. Management of the long-term exposure of these objects to daylight is a key issue for the bodies that have responsibility for managing the buildings and preserving their contents, e.g. The National Trust. It is acknowledged that systematic monitoring of light exposure is very sparse, and also that many valuable objects are at risk. Monitoring, if carried out at all, is usually just at one or two points in a space. However, the spatial variation in long-term exposure is believed to be great- typically several orders of magnitude depending on the geometry and reflective properties of the space. The installation of commonly used measurement apparatus can be invasive, expensive and/or impractical.

Aim
===

This project will employ a novel combination of measurement, GPS, photogrammetry and modeling to quantify the spatial distribution of cumulative daylight exposure in spaces, with a particular application to the management and conservation of light sensitive objects in heritage buildings. The research will include the following tasks:

Demonstrate and validate in the laboratory that long-term cumulative light exposure can be determined by proxy means using automated high dynamic range (HDR) image capture.

Combine HDR and photogrammetry to recreate the full 3D illumination field from the 2D images.

Replicate and validate the approach ?in the field', i.e. in a suitable heritage space.

Develop visualisation tools to analyse, reduce and present cumulative illuminance data for conservators and building managers.

The position
========

The School of Civil and Building Engineering at Loughborough University invites applications for a PhD studentship from individuals interested in fusing light modelling with modern spatial measurement techniques. A background in physics/engineering/mathematics or related discipline will be required, combined with some expertise in software development using Matlab/IDL. As part of a large, growing and supportive research community within the School, the successful candidate will benefit from the University?s Graduate School and their extensive and targeted skills training for research students. The successful candidate will be joining a lively community of research students and staff, where doctoral students are given great academic and administrative support and are an integral part of the University's research culture.

Loughborough University

PhD Studentship: Applicability of climate-based daylight modelling - research into practice

Loughborough University -School of Civil and Building Engineering

http://www.jobs.ac.uk/job/AGV427/phd-studentship/

The position
========

Applications are invited for a PhD Studentship starting in October 2013 to undertake research in climate-based daylight modelling and its application to solve traditional, novel and emerging problems in the daylighting design of buildings at all scales from individual spaces to urban settings. The work will be supervised by Prof. John Mardaljevic (Loughborough University) and Dr. Francesco Anselmo (Arup, London).

To be of practical use in industry, the disparate strands of CBDM research need to be synthesised to create a robust and authoritative modelling framework - one that has well defined stages, methodologies, quality assurance procedures, etc. CBDM has been applied to a wide range of real-world projects, e.g., daylighting for museums. But it is still an unknown methodology for most practitioners.

CBDM is constantly evolving, so one of the challenges will be to capture this 'moving target' and give shape and coherence to the future development of CBDM. In addition to working closely with industry, the project is aligned with the aims of two International Commission for Illumination (CIE) Technical Committees on CBDM and Daylighting. Thus the project will have significant impact on the future use and development of CBDM in both research and practice.

The candidate will work in close collaboration with Arup, and be expected to undertake visits/internships at Arup offices in London lasting a minimum of approximately three months over the duration of the project.


Funding and eligibility
==============

The studentship is open to graduates from numerate disciplines who are interested in daylight simulation. The minimum entry qualification is a 2.1 Honours degree or equivalent. A lower qualification is acceptable if supplemented with an appropriate postgraduate (MSc) qualification and relevant experience.

The studentship, funded by an EPSRC CASE award, is for 3.5 years and covers fees and a tax-exempt stipend of ?13,726 (with additional top-up of approximately ?1,000 per year) for the 2013/2014 academic year with cost of living adjustments in years 2 and 3. Tuition fees will be paid at the UK/EU rate.

Additional Information
==============

Applications can be made on-line at:

http://www.lboro.ac.uk/study/apply/

Applicants are encouraged to make contact with the supervisor to discuss their interest in the subject area.

For an informal discussion on the subject area, please contact the supervisor Prof. John Mardaljevic on +44 1509 222630 or j.mardaljevic at lboro.ac.uk and Dr. Francesco Anselmo by email francesco.anselmo at arup.com.

Presentation 1

Title: A Demonstration of the latest DesignBuilder EnergyPlus Features

Andy Tindale, Director, DesignBuilder Software Ltd

DesignBuilder is a full-featured GUI to the EnergyPlus simulation engine.
Commercially available since 2005 DesignBuilder is the most mature
EnergyPlus interface available and includes a high quality building
modeller which allows building models to be easily created using 3-D
blocks. A wide range of HVAC systems (including ASHRAE 90.1 baselines) can
be defined using a powerful template-based HVAC interface. DesignBuilder
also provides integrated Radiance simulations for daylighting analysis and
internal and external CFD for detailed analysis of airflow distribution
within and around buildings. The demonstration will show how the
DesignBuilder modeler can be used to quickly and easily set up building
geometry as well as windows, vents, constructions and shading data. A model
will be imported from Revit to illustrate DesignBuilder's BIM links and a
CAD floor plan will be imported in DXF format for tracing over. Some of the
EnergyPlus HVAC systems supported by DesignBuilder will be demonstrated and
simulations run. The new DesignBuilder Results Viewer application for
viewing EnergyPlus outputs will also be demonstrated. It is freely
available for download for all EnergyPlus users.

About the Speaker: Dr Andy Tindale is a director and founder of
DesignBuilder, and together with Dr Steve Potter, has been leading the
development of the DesignBuilder software toolset since 2000. Andy has over
25 years? experience in the building energy simulation sector working in
academia, design consultancies and R&D groups. Passionate about removing
unnecessary barriers to widespread adoption of the latest building
simulation technology, Andy has recently been working on adding a powerful
new design optimization toolset to the software.

Howdy all,

Guess what's in five weeks? Yeah, that's right, the Radiance Workshop! 

http://www.nrel.gov/buildings/2013_radiance_workshop.html

NREL is thrilled to play host to you all, and we look forward to a nice turnout for the 12th annual celebration of that plucky ray tracer known as Radiance. Developed at LBNL and EPFL, Radiance continues to evolve, as do utilities and interfaces for the Radiance engine. Come out to NREL in sunny Golden, CO, USA August 12-14 2013, and share/see what's been going on in the Radiance community, meet your colleagues, and see some Radiance-influenced, daylit buildings on NREL's campus.

Day 1 will feature presentations and demos on core Radiance additions, and interfaces. *Please* consider giving a presentation on your own work/experience with Radiance during days 2 and 3. Participant presentations really are the heart of the workshop; I will post a preliminary schedule of speakers soon. Meanwhile, I need more speakers! Don't be shy. Your work with Radiance begets more funding for core development, after all. 

Registration is free, but dinner is on you this time around. This is what is known as a good deal. Please see the url above for details about the workshop, and see below for details on getting to and staying in Golden:

http://www.nrel.gov/about/golden_info.html

This is a not-so-subtle prod to get you to email me -- if you haven't already -- your intent to participate in the workshop. If you are a foreign national, please send me your email ASAP so we can get your visitor paperwork started. ASAP, as in NOW. 

Looking forward to seeing you here next month.

Cheers,
- Rob

Greetings simulationists, photon wranglers, et al.,

It is my pleasure and an honor to announce the 12th International Radiance Workshop, which will take place August 12-14th 2013 in Golden, CO, USA at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).  The format will be the same as in recent years, with the first day being full of tutorials and software demonstrations, and days two and three reserved for presentations of work you've done with Radiance over the last year.

On day one, we will have Greg Ward presenting on new features/functionality added to the Radiance code since last year's workshop, as well as a primer on BSDFs and their generation with, and use in, Radiance. Andy McNeil may even have a few words about an enhanced daylight coefficient method that Radiance is being adapted to utilize (those kooks at Berkeley decided three phases weren't enough). Jan Weinold (Fraunhofer ISE) will be talking about his glare metric (DGP) and his tool (Evalglare), while a mystery guest from Boise, ID will offer additional perspectives on glare metrics.  Kera Lagios (Solemma LLC / Lam Partners) will be giving a demo on DIVA, and members of NREL's Commercial Buildings Research Goup will be giving a demo on whole building energy simulations with Radiance and EnergyPlus, using the OpenStudio Application Suite and SDK.  

Days two and three are what *you* make of them, really.  Time slots for user presentations will be contingent on how many people we get to come out, but figure about 20 minutes per person. What has Radiance done for you lately? We all want to know/see! 

We will be webcasting the workshop, so if you can't make it out to Colorado, no worries, you can enjoy the proceedings from wherever you are, via the intertubes. We will also be recording the presentations and posting them online for future viewing.

This event will take place on NREL's main campus, in one of our newest buildings, the Research Support Facility (RSF) which is one of the largest net-zero energy facilities in the entire world. Daylighting was a core component of the integrated high-performance building design, and its performance was predicted with Radiance. Come see a real life example of the power of Radiance's predictive capability! We also have a nicely daylit cafeteria parking garage, and a new building (ESIF) housing first of its kind grid-level simulation and physical test facilities, and a rather zippy supercomputer which will be online by the time you all come out here. We'll try and tour as many of these facilities while you're here as well. More on the buildings, here:

http://www.nrel.gov/sustainable_nrel/rsf.html
http://www.nrel.gov/esi/esif.html
http://www.nrel.gov/sustainable_nrel/buildings_garage.html
http://www.nrel.gov/sustainable_nrel/buildings_cafe.html

Lastly, I am happy to announce that there will be no registration fee, for speakers and students. (!) The usual banquet/dinner will be an out of pocket expense, but hey, registration is free, so quit complaining. Seriously, we'll find a place that can feed us all and we'll have a good time and make inspiring speeches. 

We will be posting a web page with all this info and more, but I wanted to get the word out so you can mark your calendars and start planning. Oh, and to that end, NREL is located in Golden, CO, USA, which is about 15 miles west of Denver. If you're flying in, you'd want to fly into Denver International (KDEN). More on getting here, here:
http://www.nrel.gov/about/golden.html

More on staying here, here:
http://www.nrel.gov/about/golden_info.html

Since there is no registration fee, registration is simple. Send an email to me (robert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov).  If you are a foreign national, there is extra paperwork we need to do. If you are from Iran, Syria, Cuba, or , unfortunately you will not be able to attend in person. However, since we are webcasting the event, we will be able to support those of you from these countries who cannot attend in person by allowing you to present via webex. Please let me know ASAP if you will need this option.

Please do the following, ASAP:
- Email me your intent to participate in Golden: 
- Please indicate your citizenship status. 
- Please indicate whether you're coming for day one, two, three or some combination thereof.
- Please submit a brief abstract on your presentation.

Thanks for reading, and we're looking forward to seeing you all in beautiful Colorado in a few months! 

P.S.
Bring your hiking boots.

Hi James,

I'm no doctor, but I think your gut checks out =).

The minimum 0.4 cfm/ft2 is going to be more than necessary for some spaces, and will in turn cause reheat that wouldn't otherwise occur for such spaces.  If this is causing issues of unmet hours or other related headaches, I think you could turn the minimum down in select spaces and stay within the intent of the requirement.

It's my sense the intent of this requirement is to set a "floor" of sorts, (however arbitrary) to pick up the realities of VAV system minimum airflows to maintain ventilation requirements, minimize/prevent stratification, and to avoid cool air "dumping" from registers when velocities get too low.  This sets a bar so that actual designs addressing these realities/issues aren't put at an immediate disadvantage.

Regards,

~Nick

Hi everyone,

I wanted to do a gut check of whether I'm interpreting ASHRAE 90.1-2007 Section G3.1.3.13 correctly.

That section says:

G3.1.3.13     VAV Minimum Flow Setpoints (Systems 5 and 7). Minimum volume setpoints for VAV reheat boxes shall be 0.4 cfm/ft2 of floor area served or the minimum ventilation rate, whichever is larger.

I have a number of System 5s for a warehouse facility with very low heating/cooling loads.

If I set the minimum flow for all zones to 0.4 in this screen, it ends up substantially over-supplying the baseline zones.

[cid:image003.png at 01CE7BF3.E32427F0]

Since there are maximum cooling supply temperatures (60 degrees), I end up overcooling the zones even at minimum load, so there is reheat.  There is also cooling energy to get the supply temps down to 60.

Am I doing anything "wrong"?

I seem to be following the requirements of 90.1, just want to make sure there isn't an exception somewhere that I'm missing.

Thanks!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Help the Building Simulation Stack Exchange proposal by
 building up your reputation!
Message-ID: <CAEqKKtzMwGm+zjjxmOwv6zCRK2t2z1wsj=EWsB4M+KX0k0b9aQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,


As many of you already know, the Proposal for a Stack Exchange site on
Building Performance and Simulation made it to the Commitment phase. Thanks
to all that made it happen.


What is Stack Exchange?

According to Wikipedia, "The Stack Exchange Network (also called
StackExchange) is a group of question-and-answer Web sites on topics in
many different fields, each site covering a specific topic, where
questions, answers, and users are subject to a reputation award process.
The reputation system is designed to allow the sites to be self-moderating"

This would be beneficial to our community for several reasons including
having better usability, search capabilities, and probably more activity
due to the gamification induced by the reputation system.


What is the commitment phase?

Well, this is the second phase of a three step process in which people
'commit' to using the site if it makes it to the next step: the beta phase.

As I am writing this, we already have 121 out of 200 committers. But that's
not the only criteria: 100 committers need to have more than 200 reputation
on any other stack exchange site. This aims to ensure there is a solid
base, a core of avid users. Right now we only have 6 out of 100!


How can you help?

First, Commit here:
http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/45232/building-performance-simulation-analysis?referrer=RlRcJHs5Cn5GNOQAQVJC6g2

But more importantly, build your reputation, if need be, on another stack
exchange website! There are 104 of them out there, ranging from science to
art to home improvement, gardening, etc. You can see the full list here:
http://stackexchange.com/sites#<http://www.linkedin.com/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstackexchange%2Ecom%2Fsites%23&urlhash=6eTZ&_t=tracking_disc>.
I am sure one will fit you.

Building your reputation to 200 is really easy. Each vote on a question you
post or an answer you provide bumps you up 10 points. You usually get 3 or
4 votes each time.

I joined Stackoverflow, the programming site, about two weeks ago for that
same exact goal. In 3 or 4 hours of my time, spread over a week, I had
reached the 200 reputation threshold. And along the way I had helped people
that needed it. It's a win-win situation!


I really hope to see this small 6 turn into a big 100 in no time so we can
all start to benefit from a good Q&A website!


Thanks for your help,

Julien

Dear all,
In a LEED project, generally the design case needs to simulate the energy consumption as the designed HVAC system. However, if HVAC system does not be included in the design, how should I simulate to obtain the EAP2 and EAC1?
The HVAC system is left to the tenants to design and install.
Thanks!

I?m not sure if this is helpful or not, but in Table G3.1 (Modeling Requirements for Calculating Proposed and Baseline Performance), Parts 10 (c) and (d) state the following:

c.  Where no heating system exists or no heating system has been specified, the heating system classification shall be assumed to be electric, and the system characteristics shall be identical to the system modeled in the baseline building design.

d.  Where no cooling system exists or no cooling system has been specified, the cooling system shall be identical to the system modeled in the baseline building design.

Dear all, 
In a LEED project, generally the design case needs to simulate the energy consumption as the designed HVAC system. However, if HVAC system does not be included in the design, how should I simulate to obtain the EAP2 and EAC1?
The HVAC system is left to the tenants to design and install.
Thanks!

I think that the project team should consider the Core & Shell
certification. See the document "Rating system selection guidance"
and in the Green Building Design and Construction reference guide consider
Appendix 2. "Core & Shell Modelling Guidelines".

 weather files
Message-ID: <51E5CC65.5000005@whiteboxtechnologies.com>

I am reposting a recent reply I made on the eQuest_Users bulletin board 
explaining the status of California Energy Commission's new weather 
files for Title-24 compliance, because I thought it might be of interest 
to other modelers who might be doing work in California.

----------------------------------------------------
Michael,

Your first statement is not quite correct.  The California Energy 
Commission had commissioned in 2009 the creation of a new set of 
standard weather files to replace the pre-existing 16 CZXXRV2 weather 
files, for which I was the contractor.  This work, which was finished in 
December 2011, resulted in a set of 86 CZ2010 weather files and are 
available for public download on my company Web site at 
http://weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com, click on CZ2010  (all files 
contain the same weather file in three formats -  archival *.TM2,  
*.EPW, and *.BINM).

The California Energy Commission has yet to decide whether to allow the 
use of all 86 weather files in Title-24 calculations, or to limit it to 
a subset of 16, i.e., one standard file per Climate Zone as before.  
 From a technical point of view, I strongly support the former position, 
although there are administrative issues that need to be addressed to 
avoid creating confusion or "gaming the system" that I hope the 
Commission will address in the coming year.

As an interim place-holder, I worked with the Commission staff and 
consultants in late 2011 to assign representative locations out of the 
86 for each of the 16  Title-24 Climate Zones.  This list was shown at a 
Nov. 2011 workshop in Sacramento (see attached, full PPT available on 
the Commission Web site - search for "Huang Weather Data Presentation") 
and is probably the basis for what you've heard about the CZ08 file 
changing from El Toro to Fullerton.

Although I am not violently opposed to such an interpretation, I do wish 
to mention the following caveats:
1) the pre-existing CZXXRV2 weather files were adjusted in the early 
1990's (that's the reason for the RV2 designation) to be more 
representative of the climates within each Climate Zone; therefore, it's 
incorrect to refer to any of them as being from a specific location, 
i.e., CZ08RV2 != El Toro.
2) the new CZ2010 weather files have not undergone any such adjustment 
process (nor would I recommend so doing), and should be regarded as 
"representative" rather than "average" weather files for each Climate 
Zone, selected based primarily on population and only secondarily on 
climate considerations.

The last point I want to make is that the CZ2010 files are different 
from the TMY3 weather files for the same stations in many ways:
1) uniform period of record (1996-2009)
2) uniform typical months for all 86 stations
3) solar radiation from remotely-sensed data, i.e., satellite-derived
4) different software used to fill missing data

So, to make a long story short, if you're concerned about the 
Commission's change in standard weather data,  please download the new 
CZ2010 weather files at http://weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com/CZ2010

OK, this is not EQuest and it is not specifically building simulation, 
but there are a lot of experts on these lists who might have opinions 
that I value highly.  So here goes...

I work with a new college graduate in Urban Planning from UC Davis. I am 
recommending that he pursue LEED AP status.  I have also recommended 
that he take some courses, probably on line.  Do any of you have a 
favorite provider of such training?  I have used GreenCE for some 
continuing education credits, but I don't know about their more 
comprehensive training in preparation for the AP exam.

Is anyone willing to share their experience in this regard?

Thanks in advance!

HI Robert,

When I took my LEED GA/AP exam, I studied from the LEED reference guide and
material from this website called Studio4 (http://studio4llc.com/e-store/)

I bought the 2009 LEED BD+C Credit Summary Charts from the store and it was
by far the best investment for $10. I later found that this pdf was also
available on the internet for free but I am glad I bought it rather than
use the pirated one.

I also took practice tests from http://www.gbes.com/ and I do highly
recommend it. However, the classes were okay and I wouldn't say were all
that amazing.

There are many online classes and notes and flashcards and too much
information generally and can be overwhelming. For instance someone
recommended http://www.greenexamacademy.com/
But what I found was information was redundant or not updated and hence one
has to be careful when choosing the right study material.

On the whole studying the Reference guide, the summary chart and practice
tests is all that is required in my opinion.

Ramya Shivkumar

OK, this is not EQuest and it is not specifically building simulation, but there are a lot of experts on these lists who might have opinions that I value highly.  So here goes...

I work with a new college graduate in Urban Planning from UC Davis. I am recommending that he pursue LEED AP status.  I have also recommended that he take some courses, probably on line.  Do any of you have a favorite provider of such training?  I have used GreenCE for some continuing education credits, but I don't know about their more comprehensive training in preparation for the AP exam.

Is anyone willing to share their experience in this regard?

Thanks in advance!

Hello All,

During this progression of doing energy simulations, I have tried to acquire as much knowledge as possible with respect to Building thermodynamics, psychometrics, HVAC, ASHRAE etc. However, I still need to enhance my quest for this knowledge far beyond.

I have struggled quite a bit to understand difference between different baseline systems in ASHRAE 90.1 Appedix G. ASHRAE do mentions what each system is, however doesn't explain its working. I wanted to know if there is any material which explains these systems in details and importantly why and how one system is efficient over the other.

Anup,

 

In case you haven't done this already, the first thing I would do is take a
look at the 'Definitions' chapter in 90.1 for short descriptions of the
terminology.  

 

Trane publishes educational material which explains the different system
types clearly and with a fair amount of detail.  The material is purely
educational.there is no sales pitch attached, which is refreshing.  You can
purchase a number of booklets on various topics.  The booklet most relevant
to your needs right now would probably be the "Introduction to HVAC Systems"
booklet, which is part of the Air Conditioning Clinic set.  Here is a link
to all of the booklets:

 

http://www.trane.com/COMMERCIAL/DNA/View.aspx?i=446

 

I hope this helps,

Christian

Subject: [Bldg-sim] An alternative to the compute-server fan boys -
 numerical simulation on a Raspberry Pi
Message-ID: <2C3CF455489D6B4F95AFAB84847FA41301C9AC90BB8B@E2K7-MS2.ds.strath.ac.uk>

Business Card Simulation - Jon Hand, ESRU, Glasgow, Scotland, 19 July 2013

The Simulation Community is often seduced by the dark-side of speed and complexity.  Compute servers and thousand zone models have their fan-boys. And yet much of the work of creating and evolving simulation models takes a fraction of the computing power most machines deliver and lots of real-world simulation issues can be described via focused models and focused assessments. So lets open up our options, think outside of the box and explore a totally different scale of computing resource...

How about virtual physics via a full numerical simulation suite on a Raspberry Pi?  Lots of buzz around about these wee beasties. Pure-dead-brillient as we say in Scotland. It turns out that with a few tweaks in their setup and a few software tweaks on the simulation side they are also great platforms for exploring whole-building multi-domain simulation. 

A Raspberry Pi draws ~3W, is utterly silent, costs ~30 Dollars/Pounds, carries its OS on an 8GB SDHC card and has wee blinking lights that will keep you cat facenated. And it now runs ESP-r. ESP-r for Pi uses alternative header files that constrain model complexity (42 zones and 2K surfaces and lower CFD domain grid density and mass flow network nodes) but otherwise it has the same multi-doman feature set as the Enterprise/Linux/OSX/Windows versions. 

Blazing fast - not really. A normal 20 second assessment takes a couple of minutes.  Are you likely to be generating 2GB results sets or running massive parametric studies - not so often.  Coupled transient CFD on a Pi? Who knows, but at this cost point our current definition of deploying simulation is open for discussion.  I would certainly take a dozen of these beasties to a training workshop and plug them into local keyboards, mice and monitors rather than worry about software setup on unknown computers. I would certainly loan one to a student for project work. 

Folk used to any version of Debian Linux and/or OSX can just sit down and get to work on a Pi. The ESP-r Install script recognises the Pi as a build option if you want to make your own custom version or upgrade from the repository and re-compile.  Be warned though, building from scratch is going to take hours rather than minutes. Contact jon at esru.strath.ac.uk and I will send you instructions.

For those who have a Pi and want to avoid the hassles a pre-configured Raspbian with ESP-r distribution (pure-text, X11 and GTK interfaces), development tool-chain and source on an 8GB class 10 SDHC cards can be burned and shipped.  Contact Jon Hand at jon at esru.strath.ac.uk for details.

Hi Anup,

You can check out the DOE 2.2 Manual (Page 102) where you have simple
illustrations and explanation.

http://doe2.com/download/DOE-22/DOE22Vol1-Basics.pdf

After reading that you will be able to correlate those with the Baseline
systems. This is a quick guide only.

Also ASHRAE 90.1 users manual should be your friend. Lots of useful info
for a beginner.

There are lots of other resources like the Trane and ASHRAE that have in
depth courses or study material if you want to dive in deeper.

good luck

Regards
Ramya Shivkumar

Hi Eleni,

You could define exhaust fan through zone outdoor tab, you have to define
exhaust rates for exhausted zones along with fan power or system pressure
and fan efficiency.

In case you have heat recovery (reclaim) between exhaust air and outdoor
air streams, you could define the total exhaust rate along with total
outdoor rate at heat recovery level with their fans power or system
pressure and efficiency.

5 F supply air temperature reset could be defined at system cooling tab,
coil capacity/control tab. Define the cool control (Reset) then define the
cool reset schedule in which you will define 5 F reset for the supply
temperature (e.g. 55 F at high ambient temp. to 60 F at low ambient temp.)


Hope this help you!

Hi Anup,

The best answer to this is probably to have experience in designing the systems and a background in engineering. Without that, the ASHRAE Systems and Equipment handbook is pretty good ? i.e. it tells you how everything works together and gives an outline of the physical principles behind each system. It definitely assumes you know the basics, but it sounds like you?ve done some of the groundwork already, so you should be ok.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Help with understanding different Baseline Systems
 and efficiency of one over the other

When I read this question the first time, it seemed to me that Anup 
Rathi was asking "Why are the particular specific baseline systems 
chosen for the various specific building types?"  This is a much 
different question than what was answered.

In my opinion, the baseline systems were decided by committee, with much 
discussion and compromise, and so they are a bit controversial.  I know 
that I have many times wondered why a certain building type has a 
certain baseline system, since it is much different from what I am 
designing.  I also admit that this, for me, is more about the California 
Title-24 Energy Code baseline / standard systems, but I think that the 
same principles apply.

Not being in the room when those baseline system types were decided, I 
cannot say why they were picked, but we are stuck with them!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Simergy v1.0 released
Message-ID: <51EDA0D3.903@lbl.gov>

(with apologies for cross posting)

Simergy v1.0 was released today. Simergy is a free graphical user 
interface (GUI)  that enables DOE's whole-building energy modeling 
engine EnergyPlus to be used more easily and effectively. Simergy helps 
meet the advanced building energy modeling needs of architects, 
mechanical engineers, simulation consultants, energy analysts and 
sustainability consultants. Simergy can be downloaded from 
simergy.lbl.gov <mailto:simergy.lbl.gov>. (Note that the registration 
process is separate from the EnergyPlus registration process, though if 
you aren't already registered for EnergyPlus, you can download it with 
Simergy.)

Simergy features include:

?Ability to manage and evaluate design alternatives.

?Versatile geometry creation capabilities that include: standard shapes, 
extruded floor plans from 2-D CAD and 3-D import from Building 
Information Models (BIM) using industry-based standard schemas such as 
IFC-Design Concept BIM and Green Building XML (gbXML).

?Libraries of construction materials, default operating schedules and 
HVAC equipment and templates for both conventional and low-energy HVAC 
systems.

?Drag-and-drop HVAC schematic editing that can be used to both customize 
standard templates and to create innovative HVAC designs from scratch.

?Customized summary reports and interactive results visualization that 
allow simulation results explored individually in different levels of 
detail and across multiple design alternatives.

A series of video tutorials 
<http://simergy.lbl.gov/video-tutorials.html>and guides to Simergy's 
structure and capabilities is available on the Simergy website 
<http://simergy.lbl.gov/index.html>.

Simergy is funded by a private-public partnership between DOE's BTO, the 
California Energy Commission, Infosys, Trane, Hydro-Qu?bec and the 
Northwest Energy Efficiency Alliance. It is developed by a team led by 
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), supported by 
software developer Digital Alchemy.

I think you can do other way round using DrawBDL. It can convert eQuest inp
into EnergyPlus IDF. You can only get  the surfaces in IDF format, however.

Check this link http://www.drawbdl.com/

Hope this helps!

I haven't done such a project, but consider LEED for Neighborhoods as a similar concept - I think it makes sense to do several buildings as one project.

I would suggest very closely reviewing the USGBC's 'Minimum Program Requirements' document as well as the front end of the LEED Reference Guide where it deals with project boundaries.  There are always options when setting boundaries to a LEED project, but in general if it is by the same builder, owned by the same person, built at the same time and part of the same project site you should be able to combine them.  A LEED 'Multiple Buildings' application seems like it would work in this instance.  It can save certification fees, but at the end of the day you would only get one 'plaque'.  Depending on the owner / developer, either or may be more important to them.

Keep in mind there are various tradeoffs with other credits and you'll want to make sure it doesn't hurt the application in some other way - i.e. the LEED consultant will want to review how the site project boundaries come into play.

There are always options when setting boundaries to a LEED project, but in general if it is by the same builder, owned by the same person, built at the same time and part of the same project site you should be able to combine them.  A LEED 'Multiple Buildings' application seems like it would work in this instance.  It can save certification fees, but at the end of the day you would only get one 'plaque'.  Depending on the owner / developer, either or may be more important to them.

Yo:

We are less than one month away from the annual Radiance Workshop, and I for one am excited! Jennifer Scheib and I will be your warm and convivial hosts here at NREL, and we are planning the agenda now. For those of you who have been under a rock, here are the details once again: http://www.nrel.gov/buildings/2013_radiance_workshop.html

With the free registration this year, I must admit the registration process has been pretty informal. As a result, I feel the need to confirm the guest list. I apologize for having to do this publicly, but I don't really see any other way to ensure that everyone who is planning to attend is on our guest list (which we need to clear with security). Sooooo, please take a sec to look at the following list. If you don't see your name, and are planning on attending the workshop *in person*, please send me an email immediately.(!)

Otherwise, we'll see you in a few weeks. Please don't hesitate to let me (rob.guglielmetti at nrel.gov) or Jennifer Scheib (Jennifer.scheib at nrel.gov) know if you have any questions regarding travel or whatever, and by all means if you've decided last-minute to attend, let us know, as it's not too late (but that train is leaving the station)! 

We are planning the presentation agenda now and will post it -- along with the webcast access info -- as soon as that's been fleshed out. And don't forget, there will also be tours of NREL's campus buildings, software demos, a trip to Boulder, and possibly a feats of strength competition as well. Stay tuned! 

OK, here comes the list. Get back to us if you need to!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Baseline Fan Power with DOAS in proposed and not in
	baseline
Message-ID: <C4B3436E467E7447A5712837ED007A8430E527F7@MAIL.mdaengr.com>

I'm doing a LEED School simulation.  The proposed building has many water source heat pumps with a small fan in each that has 3/4" static pressure (typical 1000 CFM for example) and a dedicated outdoor air unit supplying a typical 200 CFM to a single WSHP zone direct to the space with its own supply and return fans with relatively large static pressures (4" Supply, 2" Return sp).  The baseline building system is 7, VAV with reheat.  The DOAS system is not necessary in the baseline system since it is an RTU.

When it comes to fan power in the baseline case, I am not sure how to keep the fans the same with such different arrangements and static pressures.  How do I apply the VAV with supply and return fans to represent the proper static pressure situation of the proposed building so that the fan power comparison is proper?  How do I calculate the baseline power for each unit?  I want to understand for hand calculations.

I am using the latest version of Trace and will be cross posting to the Trace list for program specific information on how to have Trace properly handle the calculations automatically.

Thanks for any help,
Nick

The baseline fan power is per 90.1-2007 G3.1.2.9. It is independent of the
proposed static pressure, other than the fan power adjustment factor, PD,
which makes allowances for certain additional devices you might have in the
proposed system. PD is used to solve for A... see 6.5.3.1.1. Trace will do
the calc for you once you put in the proper fan and the fan power adjustment
factor, PD.

Hi Nick,

For hand calcs and to avoid doubled-work, note the LEED EAp2 spreadsheet version updated in the end of 2012 already requires the inputs to arrive at your required baseline fan power, inclusive of the static "credits" which bump up baseline fan power to be on a more level playing field with your proposed systems.  If that spreadsheet is in play and you're still learning the procedure for hand calcs, It would probably be time-efficient to start there and to transpose/re-create those results as you may need to for other calculations.

G.1.2.9 outlines the entire baseline fan power calculation procedure, and the referenced sections and subtext will have you bouncing between here and chapters 6/10 to pull pressure drop adjustments and motor efficiencies.

Keep the system #7 specific passages at the last pages of Appendix G in mind - Your baseline and proposed models feature fundamentally different fan arrangements, so you want to ensure your proposed model is taking full advantage of the relative benefits of terminal fan powered boxes relative to a system with a central fan only.

I'm not personally intimate with what Trace automates these days, but applaud your efforts to understand what's going on "under the hood."  It's a sign of a quality energy modeler, and will assuredly lead you to better results and open doors for your energy analysis tool belt.

Hello,

I would like to start a discussion about where to earn free Continuing Education credits for BEMP certification. Trane offers free online continuing education courses (http://www.trane.com/COMMERCIAL/Cont...Education.aspx<http://www.trane.com/COMMERCIAL/ContinuingEducation/ContinuingEducation.aspx>). ASHRAE also offers seminars but they are not free. Please share information on other free continuing education seminars.

Thanks,

You can also submit new questions to the exam for a portion of the credit.

The USGBC has an extensive library of educational content, some of which are free. (Not everything from USGBC would apply to BEMP of course, but some might.)

Local ASHRAE, USGBC, or IBPSA-USA chapters might have live events for a nominal cost.

IBPSA-USA chapters also host online events, these should qualify.

If you are a PE or LEED AP with specialty the CEU credits you earn to support those will sometimes overlap with BEMP topics.

Hello,

I would like to start a discussion about where to earn free Continuing Education credits for BEMP certification. Trane offers free online continuing education courses (http://www.trane.com/COMMERCIAL/Cont...Education.aspx<http://www.trane.com/COMMERCIAL/ContinuingEducation/ContinuingEducation.aspx>). ASHRAE also offers seminars but they are not free. Please share information on other free continuing education seminars.

Thanks,

Subject: RE: ASHRAE BEMP recertification

Hi, Bill.

Last fall, I moved into a different position on ASHRAE staff and Jim Scarborough is now responsible for certification programs. Nonetheless, I'll respond to your query and will let Jim fill in and/or make corrections, as necessary.

ASHRAE does not pre-approve courses or activities for ACE credits. The courses and activities do *not* have to be ASHRAE-provided or -sponsored. (In fact, many courses and activities that would count toward renewal of PE licenses and/or LEED AP credentials are also likely to count toward BEMP renewal.)

The purpose of the renewal requirement is to ensure that someone who has earned the BEMP remains current in the field. The two primary criteria for renewal credits are that the course or activity must be technical in nature (for example, not a "tell-&-sell," not on general business topic) and must be directly related to the topic of the certification being renewed. Because energy modeling requires knowledge and understanding of a broad range of topics involving systems, equipment, and building sciences, many, MANY topics can be considered "directly related" to it.

I hope this explanation helps. If you have additional questions, Jim certainly will be able to answer them.

Kind regards,
Joyce

You can also submit new questions to the exam for a portion of the credit.

The USGBC has an extensive library of educational content, some of which are free. (Not everything from USGBC would apply to BEMP of course, but some might.)

Local ASHRAE, USGBC, or IBPSA-USA chapters might have live events for a nominal cost.

IBPSA-USA chapters also host online events, these should qualify.

If you are a PE or LEED AP with specialty the CEU credits you earn to support those will sometimes overlap with BEMP topics.

I think you can do other way round using DrawBDL. It can convert eQuest inp into EnergyPlus IDF. You can only get  the surfaces in IDF format, however.

Check this link http://www.drawbdl.com/

Hope this helps!

Dear Energy Modelers,


I am doing an office building simulation. The proposed building is VAV
system with electric heating source. While the baseline is system 6
Packaged VAV with PFP Boxes.

The simulation run for the proposed building came across results with very
strange unmet load hours "HOURS ANY ZONE ABOVE COOLING THROTTLING RANGE  =
8760". On other hand the baseline is ok.

I would like to know if there is a way to verify such strange result.
Furthermore, the proposed building has Zone Thermostat Throttle Range 5?R,
and Indoor Design Temp. 72 F/70 F Cooling/Heating.

I would greatly appreciate your thoughts on this matter.

I have had a R-Pi for 3 months and have been thinking about building EnergyPlus on it. I am a little disappointed for letting the ESP-r team announce it first, even though they've always been a few steps (sometimes decade-long strides) ahead of everyone else on simulation developments - open source, uncertainty analysis, stochastic behaviour models, to name but a few.

At least I can report that E+ CAN be built on R-Pi, although I had to disable all optimization options in the compiler, due to the memory limit. As a result, E+ is practically useless: a 20 second model on a decent laptop will take more than 12 hours to run on the R-Pi! I am sure the official build from the E+ team will be much faster, should they decide to support the platform. Still, what's the point of running simulation on inadequate hardware? Well, there are plenty of reasons, actually... ... 

Luckily, all jEPlus tools work flawlessly on R-Pi, including the full-blown optimisation package. You just need to connect your little R-Pi to the internet and send the simulation jobs to a proper computer...

Cheers,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] An alternative to the compute-server fan boys - numerical simulation on a Raspberry Pi

Business Card Simulation - Jon Hand, ESRU, Glasgow, Scotland, 19 July 2013

The Simulation Community is often seduced by the dark-side of speed and complexity.  Compute servers and thousand zone models have their fan-boys. And yet much of the work of creating and evolving simulation models takes a fraction of the computing power most machines deliver and lots of real-world simulation issues can be described via focused models and focused assessments. So lets open up our options, think outside of the box and explore a totally different scale of computing resource...

How about virtual physics via a full numerical simulation suite on a Raspberry Pi?  Lots of buzz around about these wee beasties. Pure-dead-brillient as we say in Scotland. It turns out that with a few tweaks in their setup and a few software tweaks on the simulation side they are also great platforms for exploring whole-building multi-domain simulation. 

A Raspberry Pi draws ~3W, is utterly silent, costs ~30 Dollars/Pounds, carries its OS on an 8GB SDHC card and has wee blinking lights that will keep you cat facenated. And it now runs ESP-r. ESP-r for Pi uses alternative header files that constrain model complexity (42 zones and 2K surfaces and lower CFD domain grid density and mass flow network nodes) but otherwise it has the same multi-doman feature set as the Enterprise/Linux/OSX/Windows versions. 

Blazing fast - not really. A normal 20 second assessment takes a couple of minutes.  Are you likely to be generating 2GB results sets or running massive parametric studies - not so often.  Coupled transient CFD on a Pi? Who knows, but at this cost point our current definition of deploying simulation is open for discussion.  I would certainly take a dozen of these beasties to a training workshop and plug them into local keyboards, mice and monitors rather than worry about software setup on unknown computers. I would certainly loan one to a student for project work. 

Folk used to any version of Debian Linux and/or OSX can just sit down and get to work on a Pi. The ESP-r Install script recognises the Pi as a build option if you want to make your own custom version or upgrade from the repository and re-compile.  Be warned though, building from scratch is going to take hours rather than minutes. Contact jon at esru.strath.ac.uk and I will send you instructions.

For those who have a Pi and want to avoid the hassles a pre-configured Raspbian with ESP-r distribution (pure-text, X11 and GTK interfaces), development tool-chain and source on an 8GB class 10 SDHC cards can be burned and shipped.  Contact Jon Hand at jon at esru.strath.ac.uk for details.

*New tool t**hat**transforms **o**riginal CAD building 
geometry **for import in EnergyPlus*
LBNL released the Space Boundary Tool, version 1 (SBT-1) 
which transforms building geometry created in 
IFC2x3-compatible CAD software into geometry input for 
simulation with EnergyPlus.  SBT imports building geometry 
in IFC format generated by model-based tools (such as Revit 
or ArchiCAD), transforms imported geometry into content, 
form and format (IDF) importable by EnergyPlus, defines 
thermal properties of construction materials specified as 
composite constructions in CAD, and sets up basic run 
control parameters for simulation with EnergyPlus.  The IDF 
file exported by SBT-1 can be directly imported into 
EnergyPlus to immediately run the simulation of building 
geometry, or can be appended with EnergyPlus definitions of 
internal loads and HVAC data for the simulated building, as 
well as with specifications of simulation output reports.

As EnergyPlus can accept only flat surface geometry, SBT-1 
does not accept and import definitions of curved objects and 
surfaces defined in CAD.  Such objects and surfaces must be 
segmented into series of flat objects and surfaces in CAD, 
and exported as such in IFC2x3 format for import into 
SBT-1.  The IFC2x3 file exported by CAD must be "clean:" It 
must contain the complete building geometry that is free of 
error.  If there are problems with the SBT-1 output or the 
resulting EnergyPlus simulation, the correctness of the 
IFC2x3 file can be verified with commercially available 
Solibri Model Checker using the SBT constraint set 
downloadable from the SBT-1 download site.

The download of the SBT-1 executable file and the current 
supporting information is available free of charge at 
gaia.lbl.gov/interoperability/SBT.  SBT-1 source code will 
be available shortly under an Open Source license.  For 
questions contact sbt-support at lbl.gov.

I think you can do other way round using DrawBDL. It can convert eQuest inp into EnergyPlus IDF. You can only get  the surfaces in IDF format, however.

 


Check this link http://www.drawbdl.com/

 


Hope this helps!

Hi Mariana, and others

 

Here is what SIMEB 3.0 beta 2 can do (available on https://www.simeb.ca/  after free registration) 

 

-          Import the geometry of IDF file (V5, V6,V7.X, need to verify 8.0). More success if the geometry has been created by the Open Studio plugin 

-          Import the geometry of inp file (DOE2.2), this feature has not been fully tested

-          Once the occupancy, system details, etc. have been entered in SIMEB interface

o   The DOE2.2 file created by SIMEB after launching DOE2.2 calculation can be exported in e-Quest V3-63 (need to verify V3-64). Also 

o   The IDF file created by SIMEB after launching EnergyPlus calculation (Using V 5.0) is available and can be edited. The release of a new version of SIMEB with EnergyPlus V7.2 engine is planned in November.

-          The weather data section on the website allow to create an EnergyPlus weather file (idf), a DOE2 weather file (bin) or a SIMEB weather file (swdf) by uploading an idf file or a bin file.

 

So you can probably import your IDF geometry in SIMEB using  the imported option of the "Geometric building Wizard", enter hypothetical load/systems details, launch the calculation using DOE2.2 engine, edit the inp file in e-Quest and enter the systems and loads. It is the best SIMEB can do for you specific need.

 

Regards

 

Simon

I think you can do other way round using DrawBDL. It can convert eQuest inp into EnergyPlus IDF. You can only get  the surfaces in IDF format, however.

Message-ID: <51F7D6D2.8030607@wichert.org>

I see that ASHRAE 90.1 requires a vestibule in most cases, but I don't 
know if it is modeled or if it is just mandatory.  It would seem to me 
that if it was modeled, showing compliance using modeling, without a 
vestibule, would be OK (you would make it up somewhere else in the 
envelope).  Does anybody know if the vestibule is modeled anywhere, and 
how to take it out or put it in?

Since LEED requires compliance with ASHRAE 90.1 Mandatory measures, this 
makes a vestibule a mandatory requirement unless I can model it with and 
without.  If this is even possible.

Otherwise we must put in a vestibule to comply with LEED.


Is this correct?  Does anybody have other thoughts or ideas?  We have a 
very efficient building, modeled without the vestibule in Climate Zone 
3B.  I would think that we could take a heating penalty and not install 
a vestibule AT EVERY DOOR.


I appreciate your thinking about this.

Hi Robert,

One strategy for modeling a vestibule would be to assume a reduction in building infiltration.  Here is a publication that may be helpful...

Robert,
Did you notice the 7 exceptions to section 5.4.3.4?  One of them may apply to you?
As far as modeling goes, a vestibule is principally an infiltration control technique, so I suppose that you could argue for reduced infiltration when vestibules are present.  I am unaware of any research or other information about how they may affect infiltration.  Since infiltration is such a guessing game, I never apply any special curves for vestibules.
p.s., the IECC 2012 (Int?l Energy Conservation Code) includes mandatory envelope and infiltration testing and criteria.  This will probably be a game changer for the construction industry in areas that adopt this code and will definitely affect the energy models prepared for those projects.

1. Should Tenant Spaces in LEED Core & Shell projects be modeled with Appendix G systems for the Baseline, and for the Proposed as well if there is no HVAC design?
-OR- Should Tenant Spaces be modeled as "unconditioned" in both the Baseline and Proposed? (-OR- some other option?)

2. What is the intent/purpose of the requirement to model separate electric meters for lighting, plug loads and process loads in the Tenant Spaces? Should the cost from these meters be removed from the building energy cost for EAc1 savings?

3. IF HVAC systems are modeled in the Tenant Spaces, should this energy be assigned to separate meters as well?

LEED Core & Shell Appendix 2<http://www.usgbc.org/resources/appendix-2-core-and-shell-energy-modeling-guidelines> describes how the HVAC systems should be modeled for the Core and Shell Building, but not for the Tenant Spaces. Appendix 2 also describes the requirement for modeling separate meters.

I concur with the advice to read the requirements more carefully ? in almost no case is a vestibule required at every door, when they are required.

Take care and recognize that an Appendix G model is NOT a method to show code compliance.  It?s a procedure for benchmarking the building performance for design which exceeds the minimum requirements of the standard.  The first sections of Appendix G provide a concise overview.

You can evaluate the effect a vestibule or not as already discussed ? in function this should simply reduce scheduled infiltration.  That said, I do not believe any Appendix G model should have the proposed and baseline models differing with respect to having a vestibule.  I think table G3.1 is pretty clear that the baseline model is to match the proposed with respect to space/thermal block configuration and arrangement.

Finally, just to drive an extra wedge into the commentary ? while the specified mandatory sections (#.4?) ARE required of the design for a LEED project, to pass EAp2, in my humble opinion it?s incorrect (or at least a stretch) to say LEED requires demonstrating compliance with 90.1.

In sum, to the extent vestibules are required (review the sections and exceptions carefully), a LEED project must by design include them in the proposed design.  In turn, the proposed model should incorporate the vestibule in the form of a distinct thermal block (zone/space), to match the actual design.  In turn, the same edits should be applied to the baseline model as it?s supposed to match the proposed model in this regard.

If the vestibules will be designed to be conditioned by the same systems handling the surrounding spaces, you might make the case that it?s a reasonable thing to not model them explicitly as a separated space (modeler has the prerogative to identify and assert where such spatial approximations are appropriate), but in preliminary LEED submission I?d advise making that decision and case clear to the reviewer in your documentation so if it isn?t acceptable you have the opportunity to make the corrections per above prior to final submission.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Vestibule Modeling


I see that ASHRAE 90.1 requires a vestibule in most cases, but I don't
know if it is modeled or if it is just mandatory.  It would seem to me
that if it was modeled, showing compliance using modeling, without a
vestibule, would be OK (you would make it up somewhere else in the
envelope).  Does anybody know if the vestibule is modeled anywhere, and
how to take it out or put it in?

Since LEED requires compliance with ASHRAE 90.1 Mandatory measures, this
makes a vestibule a mandatory requirement unless I can model it with and
without.  If this is even possible.

Otherwise we must put in a vestibule to comply with LEED.


Is this correct?  Does anybody have other thoughts or ideas?  We have a
very efficient building, modeled without the vestibule in Climate Zone
3B.  I would think that we could take a heating penalty and not install
a vestibule AT EVERY DOOR.


I appreciate your thinking about this.

Dear Sir:

  This may be common practice but, ASHRAE 90.1 requires vestibules at all entrances to buildings with some exception given that will not go into, being a Mechanical Engineer and not an Architect, if that matters.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Vestibule Modeling

I concur with the advice to read the requirements more carefully - in almost no case is a vestibule required at every door, when they are required.

Take care and recognize that an Appendix G model is NOT a method to show code compliance.  It's a procedure for benchmarking the building performance for design which exceeds the minimum requirements of the standard.  The first sections of Appendix G provide a concise overview.

You can evaluate the effect a vestibule or not as already discussed - in function this should simply reduce scheduled infiltration.  That said, I do not believe any Appendix G model should have the proposed and baseline models differing with respect to having a vestibule.  I think table G3.1 is pretty clear that the baseline model is to match the proposed with respect to space/thermal block configuration and arrangement.

Finally, just to drive an extra wedge into the commentary - while the specified mandatory sections (#.4...) ARE required of the design for a LEED project, to pass EAp2, in my humble opinion it's incorrect (or at least a stretch) to say LEED requires demonstrating compliance with 90.1.

In sum, to the extent vestibules are required (review the sections and exceptions carefully), a LEED project must by design include them in the proposed design.  In turn, the proposed model should incorporate the vestibule in the form of a distinct thermal block (zone/space), to match the actual design.  In turn, the same edits should be applied to the baseline model as it's supposed to match the proposed model in this regard.

If the vestibules will be designed to be conditioned by the same systems handling the surrounding spaces, you might make the case that it's a reasonable thing to not model them explicitly as a separated space (modeler has the prerogative to identify and assert where such spatial approximations are appropriate), but in preliminary LEED submission I'd advise making that decision and case clear to the reviewer in your documentation so if it isn't acceptable you have the opportunity to make the corrections per above prior to final submission.

Robert,
Did you notice the 7 exceptions to section 5.4.3.4?  One of them may apply to you...
As far as modeling goes, a vestibule is principally an infiltration control technique, so I suppose that you could argue for reduced infiltration when vestibules are present.  I am unaware of any research or other information about how they may affect infiltration.  Since infiltration is such a guessing game, I never apply any special curves for vestibules.
p.s., the IECC 2012 (Int'l Energy Conservation Code) includes mandatory envelope and infiltration testing and criteria.  This will probably be a game changer for the construction industry in areas that adopt this code and will definitely affect the energy models prepared for those projects.

Any of the mandatory requirements in Standard 90.1 must be included in your building design and cannot be traded off using a performance approach.

In my original post I said "Since LEED requires compliance with ASHRAE 
90.1 Mandatory measures...".  I believe this is correct, at least as far 
as Architectural, Mechanical and Electrical mandatory requirements are 
concerned.

And yes, I realize that there are exceptions for doors not used as 
entries (emergency only or exit only?) and for doors leading into spaces 
less than 3000 sq. ft.  Also for buildings less than four stories under 
10,000 sq. ft. in CZ 3 or 4.  And for mild climates.  I do not believe 
any of these would apply to the building I am working on, but I do 
appreciate the options. Including revolving doors!

 433 Business Case
Message-ID: <CANC0d110kFHnr=2OD-qD-jfMh6VD+YULCHnhyb5b2iOyNegFWw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Energy Modeling Community,

I understand this is not energy modeling related question, but is directly
related to our field. I have been asked to prepare a business case to
defend US Governement's initiative on Energy Efficiency in which all
federal buildings should meet 2030 Challenge (Section 433). There is a
resistance from a segment of Congress for Shaheen-Portman Energy Efficiency
Bill and are seeking an amendment to repeal section 433, thereby gutting
the federal commitment to 2030.

I am seeking fairly recent case-study examples which demonstrate that
'Federal Buildings' like courthouses/offices are meeting current 2030
target of 55% reduction from 2003 CBECS. This might be in the form of
modeling documentation or actual metered consumption. It would be then have
some basis to say that achieving next step of 70% reduction is very much
viable.

Any other 'recent' resources/documentation on benefits of energy
efficiency, increased productivity, successful energy efficiency strategies
implementation on larger scale (city/state/utility) are also welcome.

Thanks in advance.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED Core & Shell questions

1. Should Tenant Spaces in LEED Core & Shell projects be modeled with Appendix G systems for the Baseline, and for the Proposed as well if there is no HVAC design? ? Correct ? no profit or loss should be claimed for the HVAC in tenant spaces
-OR- Should Tenant Spaces be modeled as ?unconditioned? in both the Baseline and Proposed? (-OR- some other option?)

2. What is the intent/purpose of the requirement to model separate electric meters for lighting, plug loads and process loads in the Tenant Spaces? Should the cost from these meters be removed from the building energy cost for EAc1 savings? ? To ensure you?ve applied the same internal gains for the HVAC network to deal with. Arguably you could claim fewer meters would still give you the same information, it?s just gives the LEED reviewer all the info they need.

3. IF HVAC systems are modeled in the Tenant Spaces, should this energy be assigned to separate meters as well? ? Yes, particularly if you want to claim the benefit of Landlord controlled energy vs. tenant controlled energy using the Core & Shell Alternative Compliance Path (ACP) ? generally worthwhile if the tenant/landlord consumption is about 50/50.

LEED Core & Shell Appendix 2<http://www.usgbc.org/resources/appendix-2-core-and-shell-energy-modeling-guidelines> describes how the HVAC systems should be modeled for the Core and Shell Building, but not for the Tenant Spaces. Appendix 2 also describes the requirement for modeling separate meters.

Is there any interest in developing the objectives in Building Energy
Performance Analysis Notes http://bepan.info/
For example: you can achieve percent energy savings for LEED, but ECM's
might make no practical financial sense.
It requires Life Cycle Cost Analysis and a first & operating cost database.

Hi wahid
Try the GBS (Green Building Studio). This is a web service provided by Autodesk that allows you to convert a gbxml file into an eQuest input file.
There are certain rules you need to follow and depends on preparing your revit file like bounding  your spaces so your gbxml file can be translated correctly. This will ultimately depend on the "quality" of your architectural revit file.
I haven't been successful yet in doing so.
If you are, it'll be good to share your findings with the list!

Message-ID: <3FBC99ECC946B340B8598009E790B2181C7B12@EXCHANGE1.cadd_group.ghtltd.com>

Hi everyone,

 

I wanted to do a gut check of whether I'm interpreting ASHRAE 90.1-2007
Section G3.1.3.13 correctly.

 

That section says:

 

G3.1.3.13     VAV Minimum Flow Setpoints (Systems 5 and 7). Minimum
volume setpoints for VAV reheat boxes shall be 0.4 cfm/ft2 of floor area
served or the minimum ventilation rate, whichever is larger.

 

I have a number of System 5s for a warehouse facility with very low
heating/cooling loads.

 

If I set the minimum flow for all zones to 0.4 in this screen, it ends
up substantially over-supplying the baseline zones.

 

 

 

Since there are maximum cooling supply temperatures (60 degrees), I end
up overcooling the zones even at minimum load, so there is reheat.
There is also cooling energy to get the supply temps down to 60.

 

Am I doing anything "wrong"?

 

I seem to be following the requirements of 90.1, just want to make sure
there isn't an exception somewhere that I'm missing.

 

Thanks!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] PhD Studentship: A novel camera-based approach to
 measure daylight exposure for conservation/management of light-sensitive
 objects in heritage buildings
Message-ID: <DDF64A46-B367-4DC1-9A79-5BD4168935B2@lboro.ac.uk>

PhD Studentship: A novel camera-based approach to measure daylight exposure for conservation/management of light-sensitive objects in heritage buildings

Loughborough University - School of Civil and Building Engineering

http://www.jobs.ac.uk/job/AGV407/phd-studentship/

Background to the research
=================

Many heritage buildings contain light sensitive objects, e.g. paintings, fabrics, wallpapers, furnishings etc. Management of the long-term exposure of these objects to daylight is a key issue for the bodies that have responsibility for managing the buildings and preserving their contents, e.g. The National Trust. It is acknowledged that systematic monitoring of light exposure is very sparse, and also that many valuable objects are at risk. Monitoring, if carried out at all, is usually just at one or two points in a space. However, the spatial variation in long-term exposure is believed to be great- typically several orders of magnitude depending on the geometry and reflective properties of the space. The installation of commonly used measurement apparatus can be invasive, expensive and/or impractical.

Aim
===

This project will employ a novel combination of measurement, GPS, photogrammetry and modeling to quantify the spatial distribution of cumulative daylight exposure in spaces, with a particular application to the management and conservation of light sensitive objects in heritage buildings. The research will include the following tasks:

Demonstrate and validate in the laboratory that long-term cumulative light exposure can be determined by proxy means using automated high dynamic range (HDR) image capture.

Combine HDR and photogrammetry to recreate the full 3D illumination field from the 2D images.

Replicate and validate the approach ?in the field', i.e. in a suitable heritage space.

Develop visualisation tools to analyse, reduce and present cumulative illuminance data for conservators and building managers.

The position
========

The School of Civil and Building Engineering at Loughborough University invites applications for a PhD studentship from individuals interested in fusing light modelling with modern spatial measurement techniques. A background in physics/engineering/mathematics or related discipline will be required, combined with some expertise in software development using Matlab/IDL. As part of a large, growing and supportive research community within the School, the successful candidate will benefit from the University?s Graduate School and their extensive and targeted skills training for research students. The successful candidate will be joining a lively community of research students and staff, where doctoral students are given great academic and administrative support and are an integral part of the University's research culture.

Loughborough University

PhD Studentship: Applicability of climate-based daylight modelling - research into practice

Loughborough University -School of Civil and Building Engineering

http://www.jobs.ac.uk/job/AGV427/phd-studentship/

The position
========

Applications are invited for a PhD Studentship starting in October 2013 to undertake research in climate-based daylight modelling and its application to solve traditional, novel and emerging problems in the daylighting design of buildings at all scales from individual spaces to urban settings. The work will be supervised by Prof. John Mardaljevic (Loughborough University) and Dr. Francesco Anselmo (Arup, London).

To be of practical use in industry, the disparate strands of CBDM research need to be synthesised to create a robust and authoritative modelling framework - one that has well defined stages, methodologies, quality assurance procedures, etc. CBDM has been applied to a wide range of real-world projects, e.g., daylighting for museums. But it is still an unknown methodology for most practitioners.

CBDM is constantly evolving, so one of the challenges will be to capture this 'moving target' and give shape and coherence to the future development of CBDM. In addition to working closely with industry, the project is aligned with the aims of two International Commission for Illumination (CIE) Technical Committees on CBDM and Daylighting. Thus the project will have significant impact on the future use and development of CBDM in both research and practice.

The candidate will work in close collaboration with Arup, and be expected to undertake visits/internships at Arup offices in London lasting a minimum of approximately three months over the duration of the project.


Funding and eligibility
==============

The studentship is open to graduates from numerate disciplines who are interested in daylight simulation. The minimum entry qualification is a 2.1 Honours degree or equivalent. A lower qualification is acceptable if supplemented with an appropriate postgraduate (MSc) qualification and relevant experience.

The studentship, funded by an EPSRC CASE award, is for 3.5 years and covers fees and a tax-exempt stipend of ?13,726 (with additional top-up of approximately ?1,000 per year) for the 2013/2014 academic year with cost of living adjustments in years 2 and 3. Tuition fees will be paid at the UK/EU rate.

Additional Information
==============

Applications can be made on-line at:

Applicants are encouraged to make contact with the supervisor to discuss their interest in the subject area.

For an informal discussion on the subject area, please contact the supervisor Prof. John Mardaljevic on +44 1509 222630 or j.mardaljevic at lboro.ac.uk and Dr. Francesco Anselmo by email francesco.anselmo at arup.com.

Title: A Demonstration of the latest DesignBuilder EnergyPlus Features

Andy Tindale, Director, DesignBuilder Software Ltd

DesignBuilder is a full-featured GUI to the EnergyPlus simulation engine.
Commercially available since 2005 DesignBuilder is the most mature
EnergyPlus interface available and includes a high quality building
modeller which allows building models to be easily created using 3-D
blocks. A wide range of HVAC systems (including ASHRAE 90.1 baselines) can
be defined using a powerful template-based HVAC interface. DesignBuilder
also provides integrated Radiance simulations for daylighting analysis and
internal and external CFD for detailed analysis of airflow distribution
within and around buildings. The demonstration will show how the
DesignBuilder modeler can be used to quickly and easily set up building
geometry as well as windows, vents, constructions and shading data. A model
will be imported from Revit to illustrate DesignBuilder's BIM links and a
CAD floor plan will be imported in DXF format for tracing over. Some of the

Howdy all,

Guess what's in five weeks? Yeah, that's right, the Radiance Workshop! 

http://www.nrel.gov/buildings/2013_radiance_workshop.html

NREL is thrilled to play host to you all, and we look forward to a nice turnout for the 12th annual celebration of that plucky ray tracer known as Radiance. Developed at LBNL and EPFL, Radiance continues to evolve, as do utilities and interfaces for the Radiance engine. Come out to NREL in sunny Golden, CO, USA August 12-14 2013, and share/see what's been going on in the Radiance community, meet your colleagues, and see some Radiance-influenced, daylit buildings on NREL's campus.

Day 1 will feature presentations and demos on core Radiance additions, and interfaces. *Please* consider giving a presentation on your own work/experience with Radiance during days 2 and 3. Participant presentations really are the heart of the workshop; I will post a preliminary schedule of speakers soon. Meanwhile, I need more speakers! Don't be shy. Your work with Radiance begets more funding for core development, after all. 

Registration is free, but dinner is on you this time around. This is what is known as a good deal. Please see the url above for details about the workshop, and see below for details on getting to and staying in Golden:

http://www.nrel.gov/about/golden_info.html

This is a not-so-subtle prod to get you to email me -- if you haven't already -- your intent to participate in the workshop. If you are a foreign national, please send me your email ASAP so we can get your visitor paperwork started. ASAP, as in NOW. 

Looking forward to seeing you here next month.

Cheers,
- Rob

Greetings simulationists, photon wranglers, et al.,

It is my pleasure and an honor to announce the 12th International Radiance Workshop, which will take place August 12-14th 2013 in Golden, CO, USA at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).  The format will be the same as in recent years, with the first day being full of tutorials and software demonstrations, and days two and three reserved for presentations of work you've done with Radiance over the last year.

On day one, we will have Greg Ward presenting on new features/functionality added to the Radiance code since last year's workshop, as well as a primer on BSDFs and their generation with, and use in, Radiance. Andy McNeil may even have a few words about an enhanced daylight coefficient method that Radiance is being adapted to utilize (those kooks at Berkeley decided three phases weren't enough). Jan Weinold (Fraunhofer ISE) will be talking about his glare metric (DGP) and his tool (Evalglare), while a mystery guest from Boise, ID will offer additional perspectives on glare metrics.  Kera Lagios (Solemma LLC / Lam Partners) will be giving a demo on DIVA, and members of NREL's Commercial Buildings Research Goup will be giving a demo on whole building energy simulations with Radiance and EnergyPlus, using the OpenStudio Application Suite and SDK.  

Days two and three are what *you* make of them, really.  Time slots for user presentations will be contingent on how many people we get to come out, but figure about 20 minutes per person. What has Radiance done for you lately? We all want to know/see! 

We will be webcasting the workshop, so if you can't make it out to Colorado, no worries, you can enjoy the proceedings from wherever you are, via the intertubes. We will also be recording the presentations and posting them online for future viewing.

This event will take place on NREL's main campus, in one of our newest buildings, the Research Support Facility (RSF) which is one of the largest net-zero energy facilities in the entire world. Daylighting was a core component of the integrated high-performance building design, and its performance was predicted with Radiance. Come see a real life example of the power of Radiance's predictive capability! We also have a nicely daylit cafeteria parking garage, and a new building (ESIF) housing first of its kind grid-level simulation and physical test facilities, and a rather zippy supercomputer which will be online by the time you all come out here. We'll try and tour as many of these facilities while you're here as well. More on the buildings, here:

http://www.nrel.gov/sustainable_nrel/rsf.html
http://www.nrel.gov/esi/esif.html
http://www.nrel.gov/sustainable_nrel/buildings_garage.html
http://www.nrel.gov/sustainable_nrel/buildings_cafe.html

Lastly, I am happy to announce that there will be no registration fee, for speakers and students. (!) The usual banquet/dinner will be an out of pocket expense, but hey, registration is free, so quit complaining. Seriously, we'll find a place that can feed us all and we'll have a good time and make inspiring speeches. 

We will be posting a web page with all this info and more, but I wanted to get the word out so you can mark your calendars and start planning. Oh, and to that end, NREL is located in Golden, CO, USA, which is about 15 miles west of Denver. If you're flying in, you'd want to fly into Denver International (KDEN). More on getting here, here:
http://www.nrel.gov/about/golden.html

More on staying here, here:
http://www.nrel.gov/about/golden_info.html

Since there is no registration fee, registration is simple. Send an email to me (robert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov).  If you are a foreign national, there is extra paperwork we need to do. If you are from Iran, Syria, Cuba, or , unfortunately you will not be able to attend in person. However, since we are webcasting the event, we will be able to support those of you from these countries who cannot attend in person by allowing you to present via webex. Please let me know ASAP if you will need this option.

Please do the following, ASAP:
- Email me your intent to participate in Golden: 
- Please indicate your citizenship status. 
- Please indicate whether you're coming for day one, two, three or some combination thereof.
- Please submit a brief abstract on your presentation.

Thanks for reading, and we're looking forward to seeing you all in beautiful Colorado in a few months! 

P.S.
Bring your hiking boots.

Hi James,

I'm no doctor, but I think your gut checks out =).

The minimum 0.4 cfm/ft2 is going to be more than necessary for some spaces, and will in turn cause reheat that wouldn't otherwise occur for such spaces.  If this is causing issues of unmet hours or other related headaches, I think you could turn the minimum down in select spaces and stay within the intent of the requirement.

It's my sense the intent of this requirement is to set a "floor" of sorts, (however arbitrary) to pick up the realities of VAV system minimum airflows to maintain ventilation requirements, minimize/prevent stratification, and to avoid cool air "dumping" from registers when velocities get too low.  This sets a bar so that actual designs addressing these realities/issues aren't put at an immediate disadvantage.

Regards,

~Nick

Hi everyone,

I wanted to do a gut check of whether I'm interpreting ASHRAE 90.1-2007 Section G3.1.3.13 correctly.

That section says:

G3.1.3.13     VAV Minimum Flow Setpoints (Systems 5 and 7). Minimum volume setpoints for VAV reheat boxes shall be 0.4 cfm/ft2 of floor area served or the minimum ventilation rate, whichever is larger.

I have a number of System 5s for a warehouse facility with very low heating/cooling loads.

If I set the minimum flow for all zones to 0.4 in this screen, it ends up substantially over-supplying the baseline zones.

[cid:image003.png at 01CE7BF3.E32427F0]

Since there are maximum cooling supply temperatures (60 degrees), I end up overcooling the zones even at minimum load, so there is reheat.  There is also cooling energy to get the supply temps down to 60.

Am I doing anything "wrong"?

I seem to be following the requirements of 90.1, just want to make sure there isn't an exception somewhere that I'm missing.

Thanks!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Help the Building Simulation Stack Exchange proposal by
 building up your reputation!
Message-ID: <CAEqKKtzMwGm+zjjxmOwv6zCRK2t2z1wsj=EWsB4M+KX0k0b9aQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,


As many of you already know, the Proposal for a Stack Exchange site on
Building Performance and Simulation made it to the Commitment phase. Thanks
to all that made it happen.


What is Stack Exchange?

According to Wikipedia, "The Stack Exchange Network (also called
StackExchange) is a group of question-and-answer Web sites on topics in
many different fields, each site covering a specific topic, where
questions, answers, and users are subject to a reputation award process.
The reputation system is designed to allow the sites to be self-moderating"

This would be beneficial to our community for several reasons including
having better usability, search capabilities, and probably more activity
due to the gamification induced by the reputation system.


What is the commitment phase?

Well, this is the second phase of a three step process in which people
'commit' to using the site if it makes it to the next step: the beta phase.

As I am writing this, we already have 121 out of 200 committers. But that's
not the only criteria: 100 committers need to have more than 200 reputation
on any other stack exchange site. This aims to ensure there is a solid
base, a core of avid users. Right now we only have 6 out of 100!


How can you help?

First, Commit here:
http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/45232/building-performance-simulation-analysis?referrer=RlRcJHs5Cn5GNOQAQVJC6g2

But more importantly, build your reputation, if need be, on another stack
exchange website! There are 104 of them out there, ranging from science to
art to home improvement, gardening, etc. You can see the full list here:
http://stackexchange.com/sites#<http://www.linkedin.com/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstackexchange%2Ecom%2Fsites%23&urlhash=6eTZ&_t=tracking_disc>.
I am sure one will fit you.

Building your reputation to 200 is really easy. Each vote on a question you
post or an answer you provide bumps you up 10 points. You usually get 3 or
4 votes each time.

I joined Stackoverflow, the programming site, about two weeks ago for that
same exact goal. In 3 or 4 hours of my time, spread over a week, I had
reached the 200 reputation threshold. And along the way I had helped people
that needed it. It's a win-win situation!


I really hope to see this small 6 turn into a big 100 in no time so we can
all start to benefit from a good Q&A website!


Thanks for your help,

Julien

Dear all,
In a LEED project, generally the design case needs to simulate the energy consumption as the designed HVAC system. However, if HVAC system does not be included in the design, how should I simulate to obtain the EAP2 and EAC1?
The HVAC system is left to the tenants to design and install.
Thanks!

I?m not sure if this is helpful or not, but in Table G3.1 (Modeling Requirements for Calculating Proposed and Baseline Performance), Parts 10 (c) and (d) state the following:

c.  Where no heating system exists or no heating system has been specified, the heating system classification shall be assumed to be electric, and the system characteristics shall be identical to the system modeled in the baseline building design.

d.  Where no cooling system exists or no cooling system has been specified, the cooling system shall be identical to the system modeled in the baseline building design.

I think that the project team should consider the Core & Shell

and in the Green Building Design and Construction reference guide consider
Appendix 2. "Core & Shell Modelling Guidelines".

Message-ID: <51E5CC65.5000005@whiteboxtechnologies.com>

I am reposting a recent reply I made on the eQuest_Users bulletin board 
explaining the status of California Energy Commission's new weather 
files for Title-24 compliance, because I thought it might be of interest 
to other modelers who might be doing work in California.

----------------------------------------------------
Michael,

Your first statement is not quite correct.  The California Energy 
Commission had commissioned in 2009 the creation of a new set of 
standard weather files to replace the pre-existing 16 CZXXRV2 weather 
files, for which I was the contractor.  This work, which was finished in 
December 2011, resulted in a set of 86 CZ2010 weather files and are 
available for public download on my company Web site at 
http://weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com, click on CZ2010  (all files 
contain the same weather file in three formats -  archival *.TM2,  
*.EPW, and *.BINM).

The California Energy Commission has yet to decide whether to allow the 
use of all 86 weather files in Title-24 calculations, or to limit it to 
a subset of 16, i.e., one standard file per Climate Zone as before.  
 From a technical point of view, I strongly support the former position, 
although there are administrative issues that need to be addressed to 
avoid creating confusion or "gaming the system" that I hope the 
Commission will address in the coming year.

As an interim place-holder, I worked with the Commission staff and 
consultants in late 2011 to assign representative locations out of the 
86 for each of the 16  Title-24 Climate Zones.  This list was shown at a 
Nov. 2011 workshop in Sacramento (see attached, full PPT available on 
the Commission Web site - search for "Huang Weather Data Presentation") 
and is probably the basis for what you've heard about the CZ08 file 
changing from El Toro to Fullerton.

Although I am not violently opposed to such an interpretation, I do wish 
to mention the following caveats:
1) the pre-existing CZXXRV2 weather files were adjusted in the early 
1990's (that's the reason for the RV2 designation) to be more 
representative of the climates within each Climate Zone; therefore, it's 
incorrect to refer to any of them as being from a specific location, 
i.e., CZ08RV2 != El Toro.
2) the new CZ2010 weather files have not undergone any such adjustment 
process (nor would I recommend so doing), and should be regarded as 
"representative" rather than "average" weather files for each Climate 
Zone, selected based primarily on population and only secondarily on 
climate considerations.

The last point I want to make is that the CZ2010 files are different 
from the TMY3 weather files for the same stations in many ways:
1) uniform period of record (1996-2009)
2) uniform typical months for all 86 stations
3) solar radiation from remotely-sensed data, i.e., satellite-derived
4) different software used to fill missing data

So, to make a long story short, if you're concerned about the 
Commission's change in standard weather data,  please download the new 
CZ2010 weather files at http://weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com/CZ2010

OK, this is not EQuest and it is not specifically building simulation, 
but there are a lot of experts on these lists who might have opinions 
that I value highly.  So here goes...

I work with a new college graduate in Urban Planning from UC Davis. I am 
recommending that he pursue LEED AP status.  I have also recommended 
that he take some courses, probably on line.  Do any of you have a 
favorite provider of such training?  I have used GreenCE for some 
continuing education credits, but I don't know about their more 
comprehensive training in preparation for the AP exam.

Is anyone willing to share their experience in this regard?

Thanks in advance!

HI Robert,

When I took my LEED GA/AP exam, I studied from the LEED reference guide and
material from this website called Studio4 (http://studio4llc.com/e-store/)

I bought the 2009 LEED BD+C Credit Summary Charts from the store and it was
by far the best investment for $10. I later found that this pdf was also
available on the internet for free but I am glad I bought it rather than
use the pirated one.

I also took practice tests from http://www.gbes.com/ and I do highly
recommend it. However, the classes were okay and I wouldn't say were all
that amazing.

There are many online classes and notes and flashcards and too much
information generally and can be overwhelming. For instance someone
recommended http://www.greenexamacademy.com/
But what I found was information was redundant or not updated and hence one
has to be careful when choosing the right study material.

On the whole studying the Reference guide, the summary chart and practice
tests is all that is required in my opinion.

Ramya Shivkumar

OK, this is not EQuest and it is not specifically building simulation, but there are a lot of experts on these lists who might have opinions that I value highly.  So here goes...

I work with a new college graduate in Urban Planning from UC Davis. I am recommending that he pursue LEED AP status.  I have also recommended that he take some courses, probably on line.  Do any of you have a favorite provider of such training?  I have used GreenCE for some continuing education credits, but I don't know about their more comprehensive training in preparation for the AP exam.

Is anyone willing to share their experience in this regard?

Thanks in advance!

Hello All,

I am an Architect by training with my masters in Sustainable Buildings. I have been doing energy simulations for the past 2 years. During this progression of doing energy simulations, I have tried to acquire as much knowledge as possible with respect to Building thermodynamics, psychometrics, HVAC, ASHRAE etc. However, I still need to enhance my quest for this knowledge far beyond.

I have struggled quite a bit to understand difference between different baseline systems in ASHRAE 90.1 Appedix G. ASHRAE do mentions what each system is, however doesn't explain its working. I wanted to know if there is any material which explains these systems in details and importantly why and how one system is efficient over the other.

I would be grateful if someone can share some info on the same.

Thanks in advance.

Anup,

 

In case you haven't done this already, the first thing I would do is take a
look at the 'Definitions' chapter in 90.1 for short descriptions of the
terminology.  

 

Trane publishes educational material which explains the different system
types clearly and with a fair amount of detail.  The material is purely
educational.there is no sales pitch attached, which is refreshing.  You can
purchase a number of booklets on various topics.  The booklet most relevant
to your needs right now would probably be the "Introduction to HVAC Systems"
booklet, which is part of the Air Conditioning Clinic set.  Here is a link
to all of the booklets:

 

http://www.trane.com/COMMERCIAL/DNA/View.aspx?i=446

 

I hope this helps,

Christian

Subject: [Bldg-sim] An alternative to the compute-server fan boys -
 numerical simulation on a Raspberry Pi
Message-ID: <2C3CF455489D6B4F95AFAB84847FA41301C9AC90BB8B@E2K7-MS2.ds.strath.ac.uk>

Business Card Simulation - Jon Hand, ESRU, Glasgow, Scotland, 19 July 2013

The Simulation Community is often seduced by the dark-side of speed and complexity.  Compute servers and thousand zone models have their fan-boys. And yet much of the work of creating and evolving simulation models takes a fraction of the computing power most machines deliver and lots of real-world simulation issues can be described via focused models and focused assessments. So lets open up our options, think outside of the box and explore a totally different scale of computing resource...

How about virtual physics via a full numerical simulation suite on a Raspberry Pi?  Lots of buzz around about these wee beasties. Pure-dead-brillient as we say in Scotland. It turns out that with a few tweaks in their setup and a few software tweaks on the simulation side they are also great platforms for exploring whole-building multi-domain simulation. 

A Raspberry Pi draws ~3W, is utterly silent, costs ~30 Dollars/Pounds, carries its OS on an 8GB SDHC card and has wee blinking lights that will keep you cat facenated. And it now runs ESP-r. ESP-r for Pi uses alternative header files that constrain model complexity (42 zones and 2K surfaces and lower CFD domain grid density and mass flow network nodes) but otherwise it has the same multi-doman feature set as the Enterprise/Linux/OSX/Windows versions. 

Blazing fast - not really. A normal 20 second assessment takes a couple of minutes.  Are you likely to be generating 2GB results sets or running massive parametric studies - not so often.  Coupled transient CFD on a Pi? Who knows, but at this cost point our current definition of deploying simulation is open for discussion.  I would certainly take a dozen of these beasties to a training workshop and plug them into local keyboards, mice and monitors rather than worry about software setup on unknown computers. I would certainly loan one to a student for project work. 

Folk used to any version of Debian Linux and/or OSX can just sit down and get to work on a Pi. The ESP-r Install script recognises the Pi as a build option if you want to make your own custom version or upgrade from the repository and re-compile.  Be warned though, building from scratch is going to take hours rather than minutes. Contact jon at esru.strath.ac.uk and I will send you instructions.

For those who have a Pi and want to avoid the hassles a pre-configured Raspbian with ESP-r distribution (pure-text, X11 and GTK interfaces), development tool-chain and source on an 8GB class 10 SDHC cards can be burned and shipped.  Contact Jon Hand at jon at esru.strath.ac.uk for details.

Hi Anup,

You can check out the DOE 2.2 Manual (Page 102) where you have simple
illustrations and explanation.

http://doe2.com/download/DOE-22/DOE22Vol1-Basics.pdf

After reading that you will be able to correlate those with the Baseline
systems. This is a quick guide only.

Also ASHRAE 90.1 users manual should be your friend. Lots of useful info
for a beginner.

There are lots of other resources like the Trane and ASHRAE that have in
depth courses or study material if you want to dive in deeper.

good luck

Regards
Ramya Shivkumar

5 F supply air temperature reset could be defined at system cooling tab, c

Hi Eleni,

You could define exhaust fan through zone outdoor tab, you have to define
exhaust rates for exhausted zones along with fan power or system pressure
and fan efficiency.

In case you have heat recovery (reclaim) between exhaust air and outdoor
air streams, you could define the total exhaust rate along with total
outdoor rate at heat recovery level with their fans power or system
pressure and efficiency.

5 F supply air temperature reset could be defined at system cooling tab,
coil capacity/control tab. Define the cool control (Reset) then define the
cool reset schedule in which you will define 5 F reset for the supply
temperature (e.g. 55 F at high ambient temp. to 60 F at low ambient temp.)


Hope this help you!

Hi Anup,

The best answer to this is probably to have experience in designing the systems and a background in engineering. Without that, the ASHRAE Systems and Equipment handbook is pretty good ? i.e. it tells you how everything works together and gives an outline of the physical principles behind each system. It definitely assumes you know the basics, but it sounds like you?ve done some of the groundwork already, so you should be ok.

Hello All,

I am an Architect by training with my masters in Sustainable Buildings. I have been doing energy simulations for the past 2 years. During this progression of doing energy simulations, I have tried to acquire as much knowledge as possible with respect to Building thermodynamics, psychometrics, HVAC, ASHRAE etc. However, I still need to enhance my quest for this knowledge far beyond.

I have struggled quite a bit to understand difference between different baseline systems in ASHRAE 90.1 Appedix G. ASHRAE do mentions what each system is, however doesn?t explain its working. I wanted to know if there is any material which explains these systems in details and importantly why and how one system is efficient over the other.

I would be grateful if someone can share some info on the same.

Thanks in advance.

Anup

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Help with understanding different Baseline Systems

When I read this question the first time, it seemed to me that Anup 
Rathi was asking "Why are the particular specific baseline systems 
chosen for the various specific building types?"  This is a much 
different question than what was answered.

In my opinion, the baseline systems were decided by committee, with much 
discussion and compromise, and so they are a bit controversial.  I know 
that I have many times wondered why a certain building type has a 
certain baseline system, since it is much different from what I am 
designing.  I also admit that this, for me, is more about the California 
Title-24 Energy Code baseline / standard systems, but I think that the 
same principles apply.

Not being in the room when those baseline system types were decided, I 
cannot say why they were picked, but we are stuck with them!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Simergy v1.0 released
Message-ID: <51EDA0D3.903@lbl.gov>

(with apologies for cross posting)

Simergy v1.0 was released today. Simergy is a free graphical user 
interface (GUI)  that enables DOE's whole-building energy modeling 
engine EnergyPlus to be used more easily and effectively. Simergy helps 
meet the advanced building energy modeling needs of architects, 
mechanical engineers, simulation consultants, energy analysts and 
sustainability consultants. Simergy can be downloaded from 
simergy.lbl.gov <mailto:simergy.lbl.gov>. (Note that the registration 
process is separate from the EnergyPlus registration process, though if 
you aren't already registered for EnergyPlus, you can download it with 
Simergy.)

Simergy features include:

?Ability to manage and evaluate design alternatives.

?Versatile geometry creation capabilities that include: standard shapes, 
extruded floor plans from 2-D CAD and 3-D import from Building 
Information Models (BIM) using industry-based standard schemas such as 
IFC-Design Concept BIM and Green Building XML (gbXML).

?Libraries of construction materials, default operating schedules and 
HVAC equipment and templates for both conventional and low-energy HVAC 
systems.

?Drag-and-drop HVAC schematic editing that can be used to both customize 
standard templates and to create innovative HVAC designs from scratch.

?Customized summary reports and interactive results visualization that 
allow simulation results explored individually in different levels of 
detail and across multiple design alternatives.

A series of video tutorials 
<http://simergy.lbl.gov/video-tutorials.html>and guides to Simergy's 
structure and capabilities is available on the Simergy website 
<http://simergy.lbl.gov/index.html>.

Simergy is funded by a private-public partnership between DOE's BTO, the 
California Energy Commission, Infosys, Trane, Hydro-Qu?bec and the 
Northwest Energy Efficiency Alliance. It is developed by a team led by 
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), supported by 
software developer Digital Alchemy.

I think you can do other way round using DrawBDL. It can convert eQuest inp
into EnergyPlus IDF. You can only get  the surfaces in IDF format, however.

Check this link http://www.drawbdl.com/

Hope this helps!

I haven't done such a project, but consider LEED for Neighborhoods as a similar concept - I think it makes sense to do several buildings as one project.

I would suggest very closely reviewing the USGBC's 'Minimum Program Requirements' document as well as the front end of the LEED Reference Guide where it deals with project boundaries.  There are always options when setting boundaries to a LEED project, but in general if it is by the same builder, owned by the same person, built at the same time and part of the same project site you should be able to combine them.  A LEED 'Multiple Buildings' application seems like it would work in this instance.  It can save certification fees, but at the end of the day you would only get one 'plaque'.  Depending on the owner / developer, either or may be more important to them.

Keep in mind there are various tradeoffs with other credits and you'll want to make sure it doesn't hurt the application in some other way - i.e. the LEED consultant will want to review how the site project boundaries come into play.

Thanks Javed
I needed from EP to eQUEST. But it is nice to know about drawbdl. Probably in the future I will use it.

I think you can do other way round using DrawBDL. It can convert eQuest inp into EnergyPlus IDF. You can only get  the surfaces in IDF format, however.


Check this link http://www.drawbdl.com/



Hope this helps!

Hi everyone
I would like to know, if there is a way to convert an EnergyPlus archive into eQUEST, I need to model a building in both programs and it will help me. I?m working with EnergyPlus V8 and eQUEST V3-64

There are always options when setting boundaries to a LEED project, but in general if it is by the same builder, owned by the same person, built at the same time and part of the same project site you should be able to combine them.  A LEED 'Multiple Buildings' application seems like it would work in this instance.  It can save certification fees, but at the end of the day you would only get one 'plaque'.  Depending on the owner / developer, either or may be more important to them.

Yo:

We are less than one month away from the annual Radiance Workshop, and I for one am excited! Jennifer Scheib and I will be your warm and convivial hosts here at NREL, and we are planning the agenda now. For those of you who have been under a rock, here are the details once again: http://www.nrel.gov/buildings/2013_radiance_workshop.html

With the free registration this year, I must admit the registration process has been pretty informal. As a result, I feel the need to confirm the guest list. I apologize for having to do this publicly, but I don't really see any other way to ensure that everyone who is planning to attend is on our guest list (which we need to clear with security). Sooooo, please take a sec to look at the following list. If you don't see your name, and are planning on attending the workshop *in person*, please send me an email immediately.(!)

Otherwise, we'll see you in a few weeks. Please don't hesitate to let me (rob.guglielmetti at nrel.gov) or Jennifer Scheib (Jennifer.scheib at nrel.gov) know if you have any questions regarding travel or whatever, and by all means if you've decided last-minute to attend, let us know, as it's not too late (but that train is leaving the station)! 

We are planning the presentation agenda now and will post it -- along with the webcast access info -- as soon as that's been fleshed out. And don't forget, there will also be tours of NREL's campus buildings, software demos, a trip to Boulder, and possibly a feats of strength competition as well. Stay tuned! 

OK, here comes the list. Get back to us if you need to!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Baseline Fan Power with DOAS in proposed and not in
	baseline
Message-ID: <C4B3436E467E7447A5712837ED007A8430E527F7@MAIL.mdaengr.com>

I'm doing a LEED School simulation.  The proposed building has many water source heat pumps with a small fan in each that has 3/4" static pressure (typical 1000 CFM for example) and a dedicated outdoor air unit supplying a typical 200 CFM to a single WSHP zone direct to the space with its own supply and return fans with relatively large static pressures (4" Supply, 2" Return sp).  The baseline building system is 7, VAV with reheat.  The DOAS system is not necessary in the baseline system since it is an RTU.

When it comes to fan power in the baseline case, I am not sure how to keep the fans the same with such different arrangements and static pressures.  How do I apply the VAV with supply and return fans to represent the proper static pressure situation of the proposed building so that the fan power comparison is proper?  How do I calculate the baseline power for each unit?  I want to understand for hand calculations.

I am using the latest version of Trace and will be cross posting to the Trace list for program specific information on how to have Trace properly handle the calculations automatically.

Thanks for any help,
Nick

The baseline fan power is per 90.1-2007 G3.1.2.9. It is independent of the
proposed static pressure, other than the fan power adjustment factor, PD,
which makes allowances for certain additional devices you might have in the
proposed system. PD is used to solve for A... see 6.5.3.1.1. Trace will do
the calc for you once you put in the proper fan and the fan power adjustment
factor, PD.

Hi Nick,

For hand calcs and to avoid doubled-work, note the LEED EAp2 spreadsheet version updated in the end of 2012 already requires the inputs to arrive at your required baseline fan power, inclusive of the static "credits" which bump up baseline fan power to be on a more level playing field with your proposed systems.  If that spreadsheet is in play and you're still learning the procedure for hand calcs, It would probably be time-efficient to start there and to transpose/re-create those results as you may need to for other calculations.

G.1.2.9 outlines the entire baseline fan power calculation procedure, and the referenced sections and subtext will have you bouncing between here and chapters 6/10 to pull pressure drop adjustments and motor efficiencies.

Keep the system #7 specific passages at the last pages of Appendix G in mind - Your baseline and proposed models feature fundamentally different fan arrangements, so you want to ensure your proposed model is taking full advantage of the relative benefits of terminal fan powered boxes relative to a system with a central fan only.

I'm not personally intimate with what Trace automates these days, but applaud your efforts to understand what's going on "under the hood."  It's a sign of a quality energy modeler, and will assuredly lead you to better results and open doors for your energy analysis tool belt.

Hello,

I would like to start a discussion about where to earn free Continuing Education credits for BEMP certification. Trane offers free online continuing education courses (http://www.trane.com/COMMERCIAL/Cont...Education.aspx<http://www.trane.com/COMMERCIAL/ContinuingEducation/ContinuingEducation.aspx>). ASHRAE also offers seminars but they are not free. Please share information on other free continuing education seminars.

Thanks,

Otto

You can also submit new questions to the exam for a portion of the credit.

The USGBC has an extensive library of educational content, some of which are free. (Not everything from USGBC would apply to BEMP of course, but some might.)

Local ASHRAE, USGBC, or IBPSA-USA chapters might have live events for a nominal cost.

IBPSA-USA chapters also host online events, these should qualify.

If you are a PE or LEED AP with specialty the CEU credits you earn to support those will sometimes overlap with BEMP topics.

Subject: RE: ASHRAE BEMP recertification

Hi, Bill.

Last fall, I moved into a different position on ASHRAE staff and Jim Scarborough is now responsible for certification programs. Nonetheless, I'll respond to your query and will let Jim fill in and/or make corrections, as necessary.

ASHRAE does not pre-approve courses or activities for ACE credits. The courses and activities do *not* have to be ASHRAE-provided or -sponsored. (In fact, many courses and activities that would count toward renewal of PE licenses and/or LEED AP credentials are also likely to count toward BEMP renewal.)

The purpose of the renewal requirement is to ensure that someone who has earned the BEMP remains current in the field. The two primary criteria for renewal credits are that the course or activity must be technical in nature (for example, not a "tell-&-sell," not on general business topic) and must be directly related to the topic of the certification being renewed. Because energy modeling requires knowledge and understanding of a broad range of topics involving systems, equipment, and building sciences, many, MANY topics can be considered "directly related" to it.

I hope this explanation helps. If you have additional questions, Jim certainly will be able to answer them.

Kind regards,
Joyce

I think you can do other way round using DrawBDL. It can convert eQuest inp into EnergyPlus IDF. You can only get  the surfaces in IDF format, however.

Check this link http://www.drawbdl.com/

Hope this helps!

Dear Energy Modelers,


I am doing an office building simulation. The proposed building is VAV
system with electric heating source. While the baseline is system 6
Packaged VAV with PFP Boxes.

The simulation run for the proposed building came across results with very
strange unmet load hours "HOURS ANY ZONE ABOVE COOLING THROTTLING RANGE  =
8760". On other hand the baseline is ok.

I would like to know if there is a way to verify such strange result.
Furthermore, the proposed building has Zone Thermostat Throttle Range 5?R,
and Indoor Design Temp. 72 F/70 F Cooling/Heating.

I would greatly appreciate your thoughts on this matter.

8760". On other hand the baseline is ok.

I would like to know if there is a way to verify such strange result.
Furthermore, the proposed building has Zone Thermostat Throttle Range 5?R,
and Indoor Design Temp. 72 F/70 F Cooling/Heating.

I would greatly appreciate your thoughts on this matter.

Don't miss this opportunity to be trained in the easiest to use, most
powerful graphical user interface to EnergyPlus available! More colleges and
universities have selected DesignBuilder software to teach energy modeling
than any other package on the market. Our latest version 3.2 has built-in
templates for all eight ASHRAE Baseline HVAC System Types, as well as the
ASHRAE materials libraries and constructions.

I have had a R-Pi for 3 months and have been thinking about building EnergyPlus on it. I am a little disappointed for letting the ESP-r team announce it first, even though they've always been a few steps (sometimes decade-long strides) ahead of everyone else on simulation developments - open source, uncertainty analysis, stochastic behaviour models, to name but a few.

At least I can report that E+ CAN be built on R-Pi, although I had to disable all optimization options in the compiler, due to the memory limit. As a result, E+ is practically useless: a 20 second model on a decent laptop will take more than 12 hours to run on the R-Pi! I am sure the official build from the E+ team will be much faster, should they decide to support the platform. Still, what's the point of running simulation on inadequate hardware? Well, there are plenty of reasons, actually... ... 

Luckily, all jEPlus tools work flawlessly on R-Pi, including the full-blown optimisation package. You just need to connect your little R-Pi to the internet and send the simulation jobs to a proper computer...

Subject: [Bldg-sim] An alternative to the compute-server fan boys - numerical simulation on a Raspberry Pi

Business Card Simulation - Jon Hand, ESRU, Glasgow, Scotland, 19 July 2013

The Simulation Community is often seduced by the dark-side of speed and complexity.  Compute servers and thousand zone models have their fan-boys. And yet much of the work of creating and evolving simulation models takes a fraction of the computing power most machines deliver and lots of real-world simulation issues can be described via focused models and focused assessments. So lets open up our options, think outside of the box and explore a totally different scale of computing resource...

How about virtual physics via a full numerical simulation suite on a Raspberry Pi?  Lots of buzz around about these wee beasties. Pure-dead-brillient as we say in Scotland. It turns out that with a few tweaks in their setup and a few software tweaks on the simulation side they are also great platforms for exploring whole-building multi-domain simulation. 

A Raspberry Pi draws ~3W, is utterly silent, costs ~30 Dollars/Pounds, carries its OS on an 8GB SDHC card and has wee blinking lights that will keep you cat facenated. And it now runs ESP-r. ESP-r for Pi uses alternative header files that constrain model complexity (42 zones and 2K surfaces and lower CFD domain grid density and mass flow network nodes) but otherwise it has the same multi-doman feature set as the Enterprise/Linux/OSX/Windows versions. 

Blazing fast - not really. A normal 20 second assessment takes a couple of minutes.  Are you likely to be generating 2GB results sets or running massive parametric studies - not so often.  Coupled transient CFD on a Pi? Who knows, but at this cost point our current definition of deploying simulation is open for discussion.  I would certainly take a dozen of these beasties to a training workshop and plug them into local keyboards, mice and monitors rather than worry about software setup on unknown computers. I would certainly loan one to a student for project work. 

Folk used to any version of Debian Linux and/or OSX can just sit down and get to work on a Pi. The ESP-r Install script recognises the Pi as a build option if you want to make your own custom version or upgrade from the repository and re-compile.  Be warned though, building from scratch is going to take hours rather than minutes. Contact jon at esru.strath.ac.uk and I will send you instructions.

For those who have a Pi and want to avoid the hassles a pre-configured Raspbian with ESP-r distribution (pure-text, X11 and GTK interfaces), development tool-chain and source on an 8GB class 10 SDHC cards can be burned and shipped.  Contact Jon Hand at jon at esru.strath.ac.uk for details.

*New tool t**hat**transforms **o**riginal CAD building 
geometry **for import in EnergyPlus*
LBNL released the Space Boundary Tool, version 1 (SBT-1) 
which transforms building geometry created in 
IFC2x3-compatible CAD software into geometry input for 
simulation with EnergyPlus.  SBT imports building geometry 
in IFC format generated by model-based tools (such as Revit 
or ArchiCAD), transforms imported geometry into content, 
form and format (IDF) importable by EnergyPlus, defines 
thermal properties of construction materials specified as 
composite constructions in CAD, and sets up basic run 
control parameters for simulation with EnergyPlus.  The IDF 
file exported by SBT-1 can be directly imported into 
EnergyPlus to immediately run the simulation of building 
geometry, or can be appended with EnergyPlus definitions of 
internal loads and HVAC data for the simulated building, as 
well as with specifications of simulation output reports.

As EnergyPlus can accept only flat surface geometry, SBT-1 
does not accept and import definitions of curved objects and 
surfaces defined in CAD.  Such objects and surfaces must be 
segmented into series of flat objects and surfaces in CAD, 
and exported as such in IFC2x3 format for import into 
SBT-1.  The IFC2x3 file exported by CAD must be "clean:" It 
must contain the complete building geometry that is free of 
error.  If there are problems with the SBT-1 output or the 
resulting EnergyPlus simulation, the correctness of the 
IFC2x3 file can be verified with commercially available 
Solibri Model Checker using the SBT constraint set 
downloadable from the SBT-1 download site.

The download of the SBT-1 executable file and the current 
supporting information is available free of charge at 
gaia.lbl.gov/interoperability/SBT.  SBT-1 source code will 
be available shortly under an Open Source license.  For 
questions contact sbt-support at lbl.gov.

I think you can do other way round using DrawBDL. It can convert eQuest inp into EnergyPlus IDF. You can only get  the surfaces in IDF format, however.

 


Check this link http://www.drawbdl.com/

 


Hope this helps!

Hi Mariana, and others

 

Here is what SIMEB 3.0 beta 2 can do (available on https://www.simeb.ca/  after free registration) 

 

-          Import the geometry of IDF file (V5, V6,V7.X, need to verify 8.0). More success if the geometry has been created by the Open Studio plugin 

-          Import the geometry of inp file (DOE2.2), this feature has not been fully tested

-          Once the occupancy, system details, etc. have been entered in SIMEB interface

o   The DOE2.2 file created by SIMEB after launching DOE2.2 calculation can be exported in e-Quest V3-63 (need to verify V3-64). Also 

o   The IDF file created by SIMEB after launching EnergyPlus calculation (Using V 5.0) is available and can be edited. The release of a new version of SIMEB with EnergyPlus V7.2 engine is planned in November.

-          The weather data section on the website allow to create an EnergyPlus weather file (idf), a DOE2 weather file (bin) or a SIMEB weather file (swdf) by uploading an idf file or a bin file.

 

So you can probably import your IDF geometry in SIMEB using  the imported option of the "Geometric building Wizard", enter hypothetical load/systems details, launch the calculation using DOE2.2 engine, edit the inp file in e-Quest and enter the systems and loads. It is the best SIMEB can do for you specific need.

 

Regards

Hi Mariana, and others Here is what SIMEB 3.0 beta 2 can do (available on https://www.simeb.ca/  after free registration)  -          Import the geometry of IDF file (V5, V6,V7.X, need to verify 8.0). More success if the geometry has been created by the Open Studio plugin -          Import the geometry of inp file (DOE2.2), this feature has not been fully tested-          Once the occupancy, system details, etc. have been entered in SIMEB interfaceo   The DOE2.2 file created by SIMEB after launching DOE2.2 calculation can be exported in e-Quest V3-63 (need to verify V3-64). Also o   The IDF file created by SIMEB after launching EnergyPlus calculation (Using V 5.0) is available and can be edited. The release of a new version of SIMEB with EnergyPlus V7.2 engine is planned in November.-          The weather data section on the website allow to create an EnergyPlus weather file (idf), a DOE2 weather file (bin) or a SIMEB weather file (swdf) by uploading an idf file or a bin file. So you can probably import your IDF geometry in SIMEB using  the imported option of the ?Geometric building Wizard?, enter hypothetical load/systems details, launch the calculation using DOE2.2 engine, edit the inp file in e-Quest and enter the systems and loads. It is the best SIMEB can do for you specific need. Regards Simon Simon Sansregret, ing., M. Sc. A.ChercheurInstitut de Recherche d'Hydro-Qu?bec

I think you can do other way round using DrawBDL. It can convert eQuest inp into EnergyPlus IDF. You can only get  the surfaces in IDF format, however.

Message-ID: <51F7D6D2.8030607@wichert.org>

I see that ASHRAE 90.1 requires a vestibule in most cases, but I don't 
know if it is modeled or if it is just mandatory.  It would seem to me 
that if it was modeled, showing compliance using modeling, without a 
vestibule, would be OK (you would make it up somewhere else in the 
envelope).  Does anybody know if the vestibule is modeled anywhere, and 
how to take it out or put it in?

Since LEED requires compliance with ASHRAE 90.1 Mandatory measures, this 
makes a vestibule a mandatory requirement unless I can model it with and 
without.  If this is even possible.

Otherwise we must put in a vestibule to comply with LEED.


Is this correct?  Does anybody have other thoughts or ideas?  We have a 
very efficient building, modeled without the vestibule in Climate Zone 
3B.  I would think that we could take a heating penalty and not install 
a vestibule AT EVERY DOOR.


I appreciate your thinking about this.

Hi Robert,

One strategy for modeling a vestibule would be to assume a reduction in building infiltration.  Here is a publication that may be helpful...

Robert,
Did you notice the 7 exceptions to section 5.4.3.4?  One of them may apply to you?
As far as modeling goes, a vestibule is principally an infiltration control technique, so I suppose that you could argue for reduced infiltration when vestibules are present.  I am unaware of any research or other information about how they may affect infiltration.  Since infiltration is such a guessing game, I never apply any special curves for vestibules.
p.s., the IECC 2012 (Int?l Energy Conservation Code) includes mandatory envelope and infiltration testing and criteria.  This will probably be a game changer for the construction industry in areas that adopt this code and will definitely affect the energy models prepared for those projects.

1. Should Tenant Spaces in LEED Core & Shell projects be modeled with Appendix G systems for the Baseline, and for the Proposed as well if there is no HVAC design?
-OR- Should Tenant Spaces be modeled as "unconditioned" in both the Baseline and Proposed? (-OR- some other option?)

2. What is the intent/purpose of the requirement to model separate electric meters for lighting, plug loads and process loads in the Tenant Spaces? Should the cost from these meters be removed from the building energy cost for EAc1 savings?

3. IF HVAC systems are modeled in the Tenant Spaces, should this energy be assigned to separate meters as well?

LEED Core & Shell Appendix 2<http://www.usgbc.org/resources/appendix-2-core-and-shell-energy-modeling-guidelines> describes how the HVAC systems should be modeled for the Core and Shell Building, but not for the Tenant Spaces. Appendix 2 also describes the requirement for modeling separate meters.

I concur with the advice to read the requirements more carefully ? in almost no case is a vestibule required at every door, when they are required.

Take care and recognize that an Appendix G model is NOT a method to show code compliance.  It?s a procedure for benchmarking the building performance for design which exceeds the minimum requirements of the standard.  The first sections of Appendix G provide a concise overview.

You can evaluate the effect a vestibule or not as already discussed ? in function this should simply reduce scheduled infiltration.  That said, I do not believe any Appendix G model should have the proposed and baseline models differing with respect to having a vestibule.  I think table G3.1 is pretty clear that the baseline model is to match the proposed with respect to space/thermal block configuration and arrangement.

Finally, just to drive an extra wedge into the commentary ? while the specified mandatory sections (#.4?) ARE required of the design for a LEED project, to pass EAp2, in my humble opinion it?s incorrect (or at least a stretch) to say LEED requires demonstrating compliance with 90.1.

In sum, to the extent vestibules are required (review the sections and exceptions carefully), a LEED project must by design include them in the proposed design.  In turn, the proposed model should incorporate the vestibule in the form of a distinct thermal block (zone/space), to match the actual design.  In turn, the same edits should be applied to the baseline model as it?s supposed to match the proposed model in this regard.

If the vestibules will be designed to be conditioned by the same systems handling the surrounding spaces, you might make the case that it?s a reasonable thing to not model them explicitly as a separated space (modeler has the prerogative to identify and assert where such spatial approximations are appropriate), but in preliminary LEED submission I?d advise making that decision and case clear to the reviewer in your documentation so if it isn?t acceptable you have the opportunity to make the corrections per above prior to final submission.

Robert,
Did you notice the 7 exceptions to section 5.4.3.4?  One of them may apply to you?
As far as modeling goes, a vestibule is principally an infiltration control technique, so I suppose that you could argue for reduced infiltration when vestibules are present.  I am unaware of any research or other information about how they may affect infiltration.  Since infiltration is such a guessing game, I never apply any special curves for vestibules.
p.s., the IECC 2012 (Int?l Energy Conservation Code) includes mandatory envelope and infiltration testing and criteria.  This will probably be a game changer for the construction industry in areas that adopt this code and will definitely affect the energy models prepared for those projects.

Any of the mandatory requirements in Standard 90.1 must be included in your building design and cannot be traded off using a performance approach.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Vestibule Modeling


I see that ASHRAE 90.1 requires a vestibule in most cases, but I don't
know if it is modeled or if it is just mandatory.  It would seem to me
that if it was modeled, showing compliance using modeling, without a
vestibule, would be OK (you would make it up somewhere else in the
envelope).  Does anybody know if the vestibule is modeled anywhere, and
how to take it out or put it in?

Since LEED requires compliance with ASHRAE 90.1 Mandatory measures, this
makes a vestibule a mandatory requirement unless I can model it with and
without.  If this is even possible.

Otherwise we must put in a vestibule to comply with LEED.


Is this correct?  Does anybody have other thoughts or ideas?  We have a
very efficient building, modeled without the vestibule in Climate Zone
3B.  I would think that we could take a heating penalty and not install
a vestibule AT EVERY DOOR.


I appreciate your thinking about this.

Dear Sir:

  This may be common practice but, ASHRAE 90.1 requires vestibules at all entrances to buildings with some exception given that will not go into, being a Mechanical Engineer and not an Architect, if that matters.

I concur with the advice to read the requirements more carefully - in almost no case is a vestibule required at every door, when they are required.

Take care and recognize that an Appendix G model is NOT a method to show code compliance.  It's a procedure for benchmarking the building performance for design which exceeds the minimum requirements of the standard.  The first sections of Appendix G provide a concise overview.

You can evaluate the effect a vestibule or not as already discussed - in function this should simply reduce scheduled infiltration.  That said, I do not believe any Appendix G model should have the proposed and baseline models differing with respect to having a vestibule.  I think table G3.1 is pretty clear that the baseline model is to match the proposed with respect to space/thermal block configuration and arrangement.

In my original post I said "Since LEED requires compliance with ASHRAE 
90.1 Mandatory measures...".  I believe this is correct, at least as far 
as Architectural, Mechanical and Electrical mandatory requirements are 
concerned.

And yes, I realize that there are exceptions for doors not used as 
entries (emergency only or exit only?) and for doors leading into spaces 
less than 3000 sq. ft.  Also for buildings less than four stories under 
10,000 sq. ft. in CZ 3 or 4.  And for mild climates.  I do not believe 
any of these would apply to the building I am working on, but I do 
appreciate the options. Including revolving doors!

 433 Business Case
Message-ID: <CANC0d110kFHnr=2OD-qD-jfMh6VD+YULCHnhyb5b2iOyNegFWw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Energy Modeling Community,

I understand this is not energy modeling related question, but is directly
related to our field. I have been asked to prepare a business case to
defend US Governement's initiative on Energy Efficiency in which all
federal buildings should meet 2030 Challenge (Section 433). There is a
resistance from a segment of Congress for Shaheen-Portman Energy Efficiency
Bill and are seeking an amendment to repeal section 433, thereby gutting
the federal commitment to 2030.

I am seeking fairly recent case-study examples which demonstrate that
'Federal Buildings' like courthouses/offices are meeting current 2030
target of 55% reduction from 2003 CBECS. This might be in the form of
modeling documentation or actual metered consumption. It would be then have
some basis to say that achieving next step of 70% reduction is very much
viable.

Any other 'recent' resources/documentation on benefits of energy
efficiency, increased productivity, successful energy efficiency strategies
implementation on larger scale (city/state/utility) are also welcome.

Thanks in advance.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED Core & Shell questions

1. Should Tenant Spaces in LEED Core & Shell projects be modeled with Appendix G systems for the Baseline, and for the Proposed as well if there is no HVAC design? ? Correct ? no profit or loss should be claimed for the HVAC in tenant spaces
-OR- Should Tenant Spaces be modeled as ?unconditioned? in both the Baseline and Proposed? (-OR- some other option?)

2. What is the intent/purpose of the requirement to model separate electric meters for lighting, plug loads and process loads in the Tenant Spaces? Should the cost from these meters be removed from the building energy cost for EAc1 savings? ? To ensure you?ve applied the same internal gains for the HVAC network to deal with. Arguably you could claim fewer meters would still give you the same information, it?s just gives the LEED reviewer all the info they need.

3. IF HVAC systems are modeled in the Tenant Spaces, should this energy be assigned to separate meters as well? ? Yes, particularly if you want to claim the benefit of Landlord controlled energy vs. tenant controlled energy using the Core & Shell Alternative Compliance Path (ACP) ? generally worthwhile if the tenant/landlord consumption is about 50/50.

LEED Core & Shell Appendix 2<http://www.usgbc.org/resources/appendix-2-core-and-shell-energy-modeling-guidelines> describes how the HVAC systems should be modeled for the Core and Shell Building, but not for the Tenant Spaces. Appendix 2 also describes the requirement for modeling separate meters.

Thank you,
Bill
