Alec,

You might try either of these two organizations: 1)  The National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) , noaa.gov; answers at noaa.gov, and
phone--202/482-8090.

2)  The Woods Hole Research Center, Woods Hole, Massachusettes:508/540-9900;
info at whrc.org.

I think the first one is your best bet.  I would appreciate it if you could
tell me where you ultimately find the information.

Good luck.

Ted Pannkoke

Does anyone know a source for a TMY-type file for coastal ocean / bay water
temperatures in Massachusetts?
Ultimately, I am looking to correlate average water temperature to OA
temperature bins.

Thanks.

Greetings:

The Applications Subcommittee of the ASHRAE Energy Calculations Technical
Committee (TC 4.7) is planning a Seminar for the 2001 Annual Meeting in
Cincinnati, Ohio. The proposed title of the seminar is:

Commercial Use of Building Energy Simulation

Studies dealing with applications of building energy analysis software in
the commercial sector for the design and/or optimization of building energy
systems are all appropriate for the seminar. We are also looking for
contributions dealing with proposed improvements to further facilitate the
adoption of building energy analysis software in the commercial sector. In
addition, any other interesting and innovative applications of building
energy analysis in the commercial sector will be considered.

In case you are interested in being part of this event, please reply to the
address indicated below with a title and a description of your presentation.

If you will go to the ASHRAE web site and look under "Research" and
"Research Projects Ready to Bid", you will see the Title, Background,
Justification and Objective of five research projects for which ASHRAE will
be soliciting bids later this Fall. The complete RFPs and additional RFPs,
approved for bidding at the Fall RAC meeting, will be posted by the first
week of November. These partial RFPs are being listed now to give you a
preliminary look at some of the upcoming projects.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200009061712.AA122960MD63811@gard.com>



Calling all simulation educators:

DOE is seeking input from simulation educators that currently
teach building simulation using DOE-2, BLAST or other simulation
programs to assist in planning and developing curricula for
teaching building simulation in university classrooms. The
curricula would present basic simulation methodologies and
abstraction techniques and would be suitable for teaching either
as a one or two semester course in engineering or architecture
schools.  The curricula would be publicly available and posted
on the web. Of particular interest to DOE is extending a basic
curricula to include how to use the soon-to-be released EnergyPlus
simulation program in classrooms.

DOE proposes to facilitate development of buildng simulation
curricula through a series of conference calls of interested
simulation educators.  Information, existing curricula, and
newly developed curricula material (documentation, lectures,
etc) will be shared on a common web site.  Conference calls
will begin in Fall 2000--dates/times to be established.  These
conference calls will discuss the most effective way to develop
appropriate documentation for teaching building simulation (and
EnergyPlus).  (DOE will set up the conference calls.)

Interested educators should contact Jeff Haberl (JHaberl at esl.tamu.edu)
at Texas A&M University.  We will then try to arrange the
conference call times to accomodate the majority of educators.
Please include the phrase "EnergyPlus Educator Forum" in the
title to speed the assembly of the list of participants.

Any questions, please contact either Dru Crawley or Jeff Haberl.

We look forward to hearing from you.
