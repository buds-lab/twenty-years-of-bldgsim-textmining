Justin,



The condenser loop needs to be a "Lake/Well" type.  It is
described on page 205 of the eQuest Dictionary (Volume 2).

Pump



Greetings,



I am using eQuest and trying to model a loop-to-loop heat
pump.  The condensing water loop is a required input, but
upon selection of any loop type available an error message
occurs advising that the loop type is incompatible.  Has
anyone come across this or have any idea what the problem
is.



Thank You

Some comments from Japan.

I have sufficient experience on practical design as well as reserches,
including system simulation and economic analysis on water thermal
storage system. I am consulting for the Heat Pump and Thermal Storage
Technology Center of Japan and compiling manuals on thermal storage
technolgy design, control, maintenance, fault detection and diagnosis.  

First of all, energy efficiency and economy of thermal storage system
are surely verified, only if correct design and control system are
applied. Important points are as follows.

1. Storage tank shall have the pistow flow chacteristics as far as
possible. Several methods are available. (reference at the end)

2. Constant temperature of chilled water, in case of cooling for instant,
shall be output from the chiller to the loweest temperature part of the
tank using either mixing control valve or variable flow rate chiller.

3. Two-way valve controlled VWV system shall be applied to secondary, or
HVAC, water circuit.

4. In case of highrise building, the plate heat exchanger between
the primary circuit and secondary circuit is required, but highly care
shall be taken for the control system not to return low temperature
difference water into the highest temperature part of the tank. 

5. That means, high temperature difference, say more than 10 degree C,
between supply water and return water shall always kept using
appropreate control systems.

6. Optimal control system with daily cooling load prediction algorithm
is recommended to make sure the chiller operation to be shifted to night
as far as possible for part load season.

7. Chiller shall be always operated in full capacity, never to be
operated in part load mode. Capacity control of the chiller shall be
excluded. 

It is of course you must choose as higher COP chiller as possible. In
most case, water-cooled centrifugal or screw chiller is better than
air-cooled chiller.

One more thing I would like to add is that DOE2 as well as other popular
HVAC system simulation programs are not sufficiently able to  reproduce
high efficient thermal storage system as I have mentioned above.

I hope above information is of any use to you. Please refer my papers in
the following, if you are willing to.

On the energy savings potential of TES.  I do recall that with TES, there 
is an opportunity to save significantly on fan power if the AHU's are 
designed to take advantage of the colder supply air temperatures possible 
with certain types of TES systems.  There is also first cost savings from 
smaller fans and ducts.

The last TES I did was for a military base.  I think the base energy manager
must have gone to a seminar and picked up the buzz word, because he wanted
TES.  We tried to talk them out of it and just go with a new water-cooled
central chilled water plant to replace about 10 rotten air-cooled chillers.
We explained that TES requires the right combination of factors, including
high demand charge, high peak hour time of use kWh charge, low off peak TOU
kWh charge, and quite often a utility company or state rebate for demand
reduction programs to make the project economically viable.  Well they
wanted their TES and wanted ice storage versus chilled water storage.
Fortunately, as this was a super ESPC project, the customer was able to kick
in a few $$ to cover the incremental cost of the ice tanks and associated
equipment and the rest of the project funded as an energy savings perforance
contract.  Fortunate, because the electric rates were not conducive to TES.
Perhaps, the customer saw other value or intangible benefits from the TES.

As expected, between circulating glycol through the chillers and taking the
performance hit of recharging the ice tanks with an evaporator temperature
in the 22 deg.F - 26 deg.F range,kWh consumption during ice charging period
went up.    In the end, though, the difference in kW/ton between the old
air-cooled recips with corroded condensers and the new electric screw
chillers measurement and verification (and the few $ of buydown on the TES
portion) were sufficient and made for a successful project.  One final note
of interest.  We ran an analysis with and without the TES and as I recall,
the TES only contributed a couple of $thousand/year in savings with about
98% of the electric savings coming from the improved kW/ton of the electric
cooling.

So, don't believe all the buzz words, get the correct rate data and chiller
part-load data..........and the customer is always right.

Dear Martin,
I think the findings may be correct.
First, for a TES system the leaving chilled water temperature usually will be lower, so the COP will be deduced, but as the outside temperature is lower, it does not deduced alot.
Second, if the TES system using brine water, i think the efficiency will reduce more.
As our experience in some project in Hong Kong and Mainland, TES system can only reduce electricity cost due to tariff rate rather than consumption.
I hope these comment would help.

Sir:

Have you checked your tower fan and pumping energy?

It may be that the program kicks these items up during
charging time.

Sort of off topic but I have predicted energy savings via infloor radiant

operative temperature thermostats.  Does anyone know of a manufacture for a

Dear Bldg-sim Subscribers,
 
I recently simulated an air cooled chiller plant with cold water tank
thermal energy storage using DOE 2.2.  I originally expected some energy
saving due to improve chiller COP at night charging the storage when
compare it with a system without storage.  However, the results showed
an energy penalty of a few percentages even though hourly data actually

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200411221209.AA092031pd80000434775@gard.com>

Greetings, everyone:
 
I'm trying to nail down the source of the typical schedules
generated from eQUEST. After some years aware from
modeling, I'm back to working in the field. Currently, I'm modeling 
a 450,000sf medical facility, building a baseline for energy use.
 
I'm curious about the basis for the default profiles eQUEST uses
for occupancy, equipment, lighting, infiltration and mass.
 
Also, other than the eQUEST tutorial and online Help (and 
the 5 volume DOE-2 manuals) I'm wondering if there is 
additional documentation for eQUEST that might address
my question about defaults for various building types and
corresponding systems?
 
Any advice you all might offer would be very much appreciated.
Thanks.
 
..Tom

eQUEST (or DOE-2.2) freeware can handle windows that include
one bind layer (outside, between glass or inside) that is either
louvers blinds or a pull-down shade.  These blinds interact with the
hourly thermal as well as daylighting calculation; included is the
effect of the slat angle on an hourly basis.  You could test this
model using a simple test zone with a window to decide for
yourself if the approach used is adquate to answer your
performance questions.  Like all modeling programs, many
simplifications are used; you can consult the complete documentation
to get a better idea of how the calculation is performed and which
effects are tracked at the level of detail you require.

At this time there is a limit of defining up to only 40 windows,
in a building model, that are layer-by-layer specified (but a
total of  8192 windows of all types, such as window5 library
imported glazing)

Below are some relevant pages from the DOE-2 Dictionary
with some information on specifying windows layer-by-layer to
use the hourly window4/therm detail calculation within DOE-2
(yes, it uses an older single band window4 based hourly calc
rather than multi-band window5 style hourly calc - EnergyPlus,
I believe, uses a Window5 based hourly calc - check its
documentation to be sure - but I do not recall if it has the
same type of blind capability, probably does or will soon )

Describing a Window Using Layers
A window can be described layer by layer using the following WINDOW-LAYERS keyword.

Example input:  A window consists of a layer of glass named GLASS-1, a gap named GAP-1 and a blind named BLIND-1.

GLASS-1 = WINDOW-LAYER ....

GAP-1   = WINDOW-LAYER ....

BLIND-1 = WINDOW-LAYER ....

WIN-1   =  WINDOW
WIN-SPEC-METHOD    = LAYERS-INPUT 
WINDOW-LAYERS      = (GLASS-1, GAP-1, BLIND-1) 
....

WINDOW-LAYERS keyword
Takes a list of up to nine U-names of WINDOW-LAYER commands or of window layers from the Library. This is a required keyword when WIN-SPEC-METHOD=LAYERS-INPUT. A U-name corresponds to a glass layer, a gap layer or a blind layer (see WINDOW-LAYER command). Figure 25 shows examples of layered windows for single- and double-glazed windows. 

Glass layers in the Library are shown in "Glass Layer Library," in the DOE-2.2 Libraries & Reports. Gap layers in the library are shown in Table 31. Blind layers in the library are shown in Table 32. Pull-down shade layers (pull-down shades modeled as closed blinds) in the library are shown in Table 33.

Notes:

?       The layers are entered from outside to inside. 

?       There can be up to five solid (i.e., glass or blind) layers. 

?       There can be at most one blind layer.

?       If there is a blind layer there must also be one or more glass layers; i.e., a layered window consisting only of a blind is not allowed.

?       Adjacent solid layers are not allowed; i.e., solid layers must be separated by one, and only one, gap layer.

?       Adjacent gap layers are not allowed; i.e., gap layers must be separated by one, and only one, solid layer.

?       A blind layer can be the first layer (exterior blind), the last layer (interior blind), or an intermediate layer (between-glass blind).

?       The gas in the gap on the inside of an exterior blind or the outside of an interior blind must be air.

?       The gaps on either side of a between-glass blind must have the same gas (but this gas does not need to be air).



Window Blind Control
The following keywords are used to control slat-type window blinds. They apply only if WIN-SPEC-METHOD=LAYERS-INPUT and one of the layers is a blind. See WINDOW-LAYERS keyword, above, and WINDOW-LAYER command.

BLIND-ADJ-TYPE
Takes a code-word that indicates how the blind coverage (the fraction of the window covered by a blind) is adjusted if a blind is present.

    NONE                              There is no adjustment; the blind coverage is fixed at the value of BLIND-COVER in the blind's WINDOW-LAYER command. 

    SCHEDULE                      The blind coverage varies according to a user-defined schedule given by BLIND-SCHEDULE.

    SOLAR-INTENSITY         If the direct plus diffuse solar radiation incident on the window exceeds the value given by BLIND-TRIGG-SCH, the blind coverage is set to the value of BLIND-COVER-MAX in the blind's WINDOW-LAYER command. Otherwise, the blind coverage stays at BLIND-COVER.

    ROOM-TEMP                   If the room temperature at the beginning of the hour exceeds the value given by BLIND-TRIGG-SCH, the blind coverage is set to the value of BLIND-COVER-MAX in the blind's WINDOW-LAYER command. Otherwise, the blind coverage stays at BLIND-COVER. [FOR FUTURE IMPLEMENTAITON]

BLIND-SCHEDULE
Takes the U-name of a schedule that adjusts the blind coverage between the values of BLIND-COVER-MIN and BLIND-COVER-MAX in the blind's WINDOW-LAYER command. This schedule is used only if BLIND-ADJ-TYPE = SCHEDULE. It should have TYPE = FRACTION. A schedule value of f , which should be between 0.0 and 1.0, gives 

            blind coverage = f * [BLIND-COVER-MAX] + (1-f) * [BLIND-COVER-MIN]

BLIND-TRIGG-SCH
Takes the U-name of a schedule of solar intensity values (if BLIND-ADJ-TYPE = SOLAR-INTENSITY) or room temperature values (if BLIND-ADJ-TYPE = ROOM-TEMP) that are used to adjust blind coverage. For solar intensity, the schedule should have TYPE = RADIATION and the schedule value should be the sum of direct plus diffuse solar radiation incident on the window (after shading by overhangs and other obstructions) per unit window area (Btuh/ft2 or W/m2). For room temperature, the schedule should have TYPE = TEMPERATURE and the schedule value should be in ?F or ?C. 

SLAT-ADJ-TYPE
Takes a code-word indicating how the slat angle is adjusted if a blind is present.

NONE                              There is no adjustment; the slat angle is fixed at the value of SLAT-ANGLE in the blind's WINDOW-LAYER command.

SCHEDULE                      The slat angle varies according to a user-defined schedule given by SLAT-SCHEDULE, below.

SOLAR-INTENSITY         If the direct plus diffuse solar radiation incident on the window exceeds the value given by SLAT-TRIGG-SCH, then:

The slat angle is adjusted to a value that just blocks direct sun if the sun is in front of the window and SLAT-SEPARATION is less than or equal to SLAT-WIDTH (the usual case).?F

If the sun is in front of the window but SLAT-SEPARATION is greater than SLAT-WIDTH, then the sun cannot be fully blocked and the slat angle is set to 90o, which maximizes blockage.

If the sun is in back of the window, the slat angle is set to SLAT-ANGLE.

The above adjustments are made even on overcast days when there is no direct sun.

ROOM-TEMP                   If the room temperature at the beginning of the hour exceeds the value given by SLAT-TRIGG-SCH, then the slat angle is adjusted as described for SOLAR-INTENSITY. [FOR FUTURE IMPLEMENTAITON]

SLAT-SCHEDULE
Takes the U-name of a schedule that adjusts the slat angle to a fraction of SLAT-ANGLE-MAX or SLAT-ANGLE-MIN. This schedule is used only if SLAT-ADJ-TYPE = SCHEDULE. A schedule value of f gives 

            slat angle           = f  * [SLAT-ANGLE-MAX], if f > 0

            slat angle           = f * [SLAT-ANGLE-MIN], if f < 0

The schedule should have TYPE = FRACTION if only positive values of f are used, in which case f should be between 0 and 1. If positive and negative values of f are used than the schedule should have TYPE = EXP-FRACTION, in which case f should be between -1 and 1.

SLAT-TRIGG-SCH
Takes the U-name of a schedule of solar intensity values (if SLAT-ADJ-TYPE = SOLAR-INTENSITY) or room temperature values (if SLAT-ADJ-TYPE = ROOM-TEMP) that are used to adjust the slat angle. For solar intensity, the schedule should have TYPE = RADIATION and the schedule value should be the sum of direct plus diffuse solar radiation incident on the window (after shading by overhangs and other obstructions) per unit window area (Btuh/h-ft2 or W/m2). For room temperature, the schedule should have TYPE = TEMPERATURE and the schedule value should be a temperature (?F or ?C).

WINDOW-LAYER COMMAND
This command, and the associated WINDOW-LAYERS keyword in the WINDOW command, are used when you want to build up a window from layers, much as a wall can be built up from layers. Three types of window layer are allowed: glass, gap and blind. For example, a single-glazed window with no covering would have only a glass layer. A double-glazed window would have three layers: two glass layers separated by a gap of air or other gas. A single-glazed window with a blind would also have three layers: a glass layer and a blind layer separated by a gap. The WINDOW-LAYER command allows you to specify the type and properties of a layer.

U-name is required. To specify the set of one or more layers that comprise a window, you assign a list of WINDOW-LAYER U-names to the WINDOW-LAYERS keyword in the WINDOW command.

The program calculates the overall thermal and solar-optical properties of a window from the individual layer properties and the order of the layers in the window. Accounted for are the layer-to-layer interreflection of solar, visible and IR radiation and the dependence of transmittance, absorptance, and reflectance on the angle of incidence of solar and visible radiation on the window. For blind layers, the program accounts for the effect on transmittance of slat angle and other slat properties.

Table 37 shows all of the WINDOW-LAYER keywords and their default values by layer type. 

In the following:

 For a glass or gap layer, "front" means the outside of the layer (the side facing outdoors). For a horizontal blind in a vertical window, "front" means the side of the slat that faces up when the blind is fully open. For vertical blinds in a vertical window, "front" means the side of the slat that faces to the right when you look at the blind from the outside of the window and the blind is fully open.

For a glass or gap layer, "back" means the inside of a layer (the side facing the room). For a blind layer, "back" means the side of the slat that faces indoors when the slat points downwards (SLAT-ANGLE > 0).

 "Solar" means the full spectrum of radiation from the sun

"Visible" means the visible part of radiation from the sun

"Beam" means direct radiation

"Hemispherical" means diffuse radiation

TYPE
Takes a code-word indicating the type of layer.

GLASS                              is a layer of glass, plastic or other transparent material. 

GAP                                  is a layer of gas, usually air, but possibly argon or other gas, that separates two glass layers or a glass layer and a blind layer.

BLIND                              is a slatted shading device such as a venetian blind. The slats may be fixed or movable. A blind can be on the outside of the window, on the inside, or between glass layers.

Solar radiation keywords
TRANS-SOL-BB
For glass or blind layer: Beam-beam transmittance at normal incidence of solar radiation striking the front or back of a glass layer or slat in a blind layer. Although TRANS-SOL-BB can be defined for a blind (in the rare case that the slats are transparent or perforated), the program will calculate the transmitted radiation as diffuse.

TRANS-SOL-BH
For blind layer only: Beam-hemispherical transmittance of solar radiation striking the front or back of a slat at normal incidence. 

REFL-SOL-BH
For blind layer only: Beam-hemispherical reflectance of solar radiation striking the front of a slat at normal incidence.

BACKREFL-SOL-BH
For blind layer only: Beam-hemispherical reflectance of solar radiation striking the back of a slat at normal incidence.

TRANS-SOL-HH
For blind layer only: Hemispherical-hemispherical transmittance of solar radiation striking the front or back of a slat.

REFL-SOL-HH
For blind layer only: Hemispherical-hemispherical reflectance of solar radiation striking the front of a slat.

BACKREFL-SOL-HH
For blind layer only: Hemispherical-hemispherical reflectance of solar radiation striking the back of a slat.

Visible radiation keywords (blinds)
TRANS-VIS-BH
For blind layer only: Beam-hemispherical transmittance of visible radiation striking the front or back of a slat at normal incidence.

REFL-VIS-BH
For blind layer only: Beam-hemispherical reflectance of visible radiation striking the front of a slat at normal incidence.

BACKREFL-VIS-BH
For blind layer only: Beam-hemispherical reflectance of visible radiation striking the back of a slat at normal incidence.

TRANS-VIS-HH
For blind layer only: Hemispherical-hemispherical transmittance of visible radiation striking the front or back of a slat.

REFL-VIS-HH
For blind layer only: Hemispherical-hemispherical reflectance for visible radiation striking the front of a slat.

BACKREFL-VIS-HH
For blind layer only: Hemispherical-hemispherical reflectance for visible radiation striking the back of a slat.

Infrared radiation keywords (apply only to glass or blind layers)
TRANS-IR
The infrared transmittance of a glass layer or slat in a blind layer. Assumed independent of angle of incidence.

EMIS-IR
The hemispherical infrared emissivity of the front of a glass layer or the front of a slat in a blind layer.

BACKEMIS-IR
The hemispherical infrared emissivity of the back of a glass layer or the back of a slat in a blind layer.

Slat and blind keywords (apply only to blind layers)
SLAT-ORIENTATION
Takes a code-word that indicates the orientation of the slats in a blind layer.

HORIZONTAL                 indicates that the slats are parallel to the X-axis of the window. For a vertical window, the slats are horizontal (parallel to the ground).

VERTICAL                        indicates that the slats are parallel to the Y-axis of the window. For a vertical window, the slats are vertical (perpendicular to the ground).

SLAT-ANGLE
The angle between the plane of the slat and the window outward normal (see Figure 29). For horizontal slats in a vertical window, this is the angle between the slat and a horizontal plane; in this case SLAT-ANGLE is positive when the front of the slat points down and negative when the front of the slat points up. For vertical slats in a vertical window, this is the angle between the front of the slat and vertical plane normal to the window; in this case SLAT-ANGLE is positive when the front of the slat points to the right and negative when the front of the slat points to the left when you are facing the outside of the window.

SLAT-ANGLE-MIN
The minimum slat angle for angle-adjustable slats (due to limitations in the blind construction or control).

SLAT-ANGLE-MAX
The maximum slat angle for angle-adjustable slats (due to limitations in the blind construction or control). SLAT-ANGLE-MAX should be greater than SLAT-ANGLE-MIN.

SLAT-WIDTH
The width of the slat, as shown in Figure 29. The default value corresponds to slats that are 1.0 in wide.

SLAT-SEPARATION
The distance between slats. See Figure 29. The default value corresponds to slats that are 0.75 in apart.

BLIND-COVER
Fraction of the glazed area covered by the blind. Used only when the blind coverage is fixed (i.e., blinds cannot move up and down). It is assumed that a blind,if present, covers all or part of the glazed area of the window. It does not cover any of the framed portion of the window if the window has a frame.

BLIND-COVER-MIN
Minimum fraction of glazed area covered by blind (used when blind coverage is variable). If all of the retracted slats remain over the glazed opening (e.g., there is no recess above the window to accept retracted slats), then BLIND-COVER-MIN should be greater than

            (THICKNESS + ?) / (THICKNESS + [SLAT-SEPARATION]),

which is the fraction of the window covered by the blind when the blind is fully retracted. (Here, ? is the separation between adjacent slat faces when the blinds are fully retracted.)

BLIND-COVER-MAX
Maximum fraction of window area covered by blind (used when blind coverage is variable). BLIND-COVER-MAX should be greater than BLIND-COVER-MIN.

Keywords for a glass, blind, or gap layer
THICKNESS
The thickness of a glass layer, a gap layer, or the slats in a blind layer. For a glass layer, THICKNESS is the surface-to-surface thickness. 

For a gap between two glass layers, THICKNESS is the distance between the inside surface of one glass layer and the outside surface of the other glass layer. 

For a gap between a glass layer and a blind layer, THICKNESS is the distance between the center plane of the blinds and the glass surface. In this case, the gap THICKNESS should be greater than SLAT-WIDTH/2 to allow room for the slats when fully open. 

For a blind layer, THICKNESS is the surface-to-surface thickness of the slats. 

The default thickness for glass and gap corresponds to 1/4 in (6.3 mm) and for blinds corresponds to 0.04 in (1.0 mm).

CONDUCTIVITY
For a glass or gap layer, the conductance of the layer times its THICKNESS. For a blind layer, the conductance of the slat times its THICKNESS.

How to Model Pull-Down Shades

You can model a translucent pull-down shade by entering it as a blind with closed slats in the WINDOW-LAYERS list. In this case, you should not specify SLAT-ADJ-TYPE, SLAT-SCHEDULE, or SLAT-TRIGG-SCH. Shades that are input this way will give a more accurate calculation of solar gain than if modeled using SHADING-SCHEDULE and VIS-TRANS-SCH because inter-reflections between the shade and glass layers are properly taken into account in the calculation. 

Table 33 shows the pull-down shade layers that are in the Library. To describe your own pull-down shade layer, your input might look like the following for a shade with a solar and visible transmittance of 20% and a solar and visible reflectance of 70%:

Shade-T20-R70 = WINDOW-LAYER
TYPE               = BLIND
THICKNESS          = 0.00066
CONDUCTIVITY       = 0.0667
SLAT-ANGLE         = 89.95
SLAT-ORIENTATION   = HORIZONTAL
SLAT-WIDTH         = 0.0840
SLAT-SEPARATION    = 0.0833
TRANS-SOL-BH       = 0.20
TRANS-SOL-HH       = 0.20
REFL-SOL-BH        = 0.70
REFL-SOL-HH        = 0.70
BACKREFL-SOL-BH    = 0.70
BACKREFL-SOL-HH    = 0.70
TRANS-VIS-BH       = 0.20
TRANS-VIS-HH       = 0.20
REFL-VIS-BH        = 0.70
REFL-VIS-HH        = 0.70 
BACKREFL-VIS-BH    = 0.70
BACKREFL-VIS-HH    = 0.70 ..

Jeff, Vic,

I was the PMS chair for Sue Reilly's project, which was on a topic somewhat
(or a lot) different from Vic's question. Sue's project was to model
secondary sources of solar gain, esp. solar gain reflected by adjoining
buildings on the building being studied.  Sue did this by combining Radiance
with DOE-2.  The modeling method worked, but on a practical level, I doubt
very many people used it because the effort to build the daughter Radiance
input file and then run Radiance was an order of magnitude greater than the
mother DOE-2 run.

It seems Vic's problem can be solved by measurements or ray-tracing programs
that can then be simplified as effective Shading Coefficients dependent on
louver angle, and sun angle.  How much the louvers are drawn would be
difficult to model, as it would require splitting the window into two parts
that change in size dependent on the louver schedule.  I don't know if
there's any program that can model this.

Vic,

you have to split the simulation of external louvres into following two
parts:

1) Calculating the energetic properties of the louvers by special software:
The energetic properties - usually the angle dependant overall-transmission 
(over all single layers of the facade) and absorption (at each layer of the
transparent component) - must be calculated by a tool, which considers
multiple reflections between all layers (i.e. the external louvers and
usually two glaz panes) as well as the spectral distribution of
transmission,
reflectance and absorption of each layer. This means that the calculations
must be done for several wavelength intervalls (multiband calculations)
within
the wavelength-range of solar radiation (appr. 300 - 2500 nm) and at last a
weigted integration of the single-band results must be done.
These complex calculations are described in ISO 15099: Thermal performance 
of windows, doors and shading devices - Detailed calculations.
If you don?t want to code these complexe calculations for yourself, the
cost-free European software WIS can be recommended to you. See
http://windat.ucd.ie/wis/html/index.html

The American people from LBNL also are working on enhancing their
WINDOW-software
with a model for louvres. See
http://windows.lbl.gov/software/window/window.html

As results you will get integral energetic properies (integrated over the
complete range of solar radiation) as a function of incident angle; these
values take into account all multiple reflections between the layers as well

as the spectral distribution of all considered layers (i.e. glaz panes or 
inclined louvres). 

2) Using these angle dependant transmission and absorption at each layer of
the facade as input data for the simulation tool (condition: It is a high
quality simulation tool, which includes a model for heat conduction within
even the transparent components based upon 1-D-finite-Element heat
conduction)

You see multiple reflections (as well as spectral distributions) can
be taken into account for thermal simulations.

Regards,
Gunter

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] external louvres
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200411190552.AA5235921pd80000431367@gard.com>

Are there any simulation programs that handle external louvres by 
calculating multiple reflections, or is it normal to e.g. factor down 
the exposed area of glass?

The next release of our foAudits PDA and 
web-based audits is now available. 

foAudits provides a framework to handle 
energy audits, inspections and surveys for
the Palm OS, Pocket PC and various phones.

Your existing paper-based audit is modified
to utilize a PDA format.

Additions include new field types (such as 
support for very large lists); linked lists; 
customer signatures; pop-up tool tip-like help; 
and hardware support for Symbian phones. 

But most importantly -- we work with energy 
companies. See our site for examples.

District steam is not always waste energy from a power plant.  In the case 
that district steam is just for heating and cooling, then the ASHRAE 90.1 
states correctly that the heating and/or cooling should be modelled as 
purchased using the applicable rate.  For situations were the building uses 
steam that can't be used by the power plant I would suggest that the 
proposed would only get credit if the overall steam efficiency (work out/ 
fuel in) is greater than 75% AFUE.  This is the budget building 
perscriptive requirement for steam boilers.  LEED should not give credit 
for using a convenient heat/cool source if that source is inefficient overall.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200411171810.AA1030890pd80000429558@gard.com>

eQuest shade schedules

 

Individual window overhangs or fins can be assigned directly from the window properties menu (attached shade). 

External shades and building shades can also be created that are independent of any specific window geometry. Blinds-Slats-Drapes Tab allows a shading schedule to be introduced.

 

Another way is to use Building Shades (see DOE 2.2 Dictionary p.45). These can also be used to represent overhangs or fins or they even can be crudely shaped to roughly simulate a tree or adjacent wall, etc. 

 

Shading schedules are created in the schedule section (see the component tree-Annual, Weekly and Daily Schedules are available creation and editing) of eQuest and then assigned within the property menus. The eQuest help index will identify what schedule type is appropriate. Shade schedules add a time-dependant element to the transmittance. Thus you could simulate times of year when the "tree" losses it's leaves.

 

Hope that helps some.

Where and how does one enter a "shade" schedule in eQUEST? For example for deciduous trees or louvers detached from the facade. Where do you enter its properties. Would it be entered as a building shade or a fixed shade? If as a building shade then does it get assigned to a window or a fa?ade?

Thank you,

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200411161445.AA4549718pd80000427926@gard.com>

Joint frequency tables for DB/WB, DB/DP, DB/enthalpy, and DB/WS are
available on the ASHRAE Weather Data Viewer (WDVIEW) CD-ROM product. The
cumulative frequencies and joint frequencies of these parameters are given
by month or for the entire year for each of the 1400+ locations that are
listed in the ASHRAE Handbook - Fundamentals. A description of the CD can be
found on the ASHRAE TC4.2 website or at
http://www.bae.uky.edu/~colliver/Programs/wdview_21.htm 

 

The joint frequency data presented in the CD will then have to be imported
into a program than can plot the 3-D data. I used Excel but other packages
may be used.

 

Hope this helps.

Dear Building Simulation List, 

I think that I've seen joint frequency binned weather data (drybulb,
wetbulb) plotted on a psychrometric chart. Colors may have been used to
indicate the number of hours in each bin.

It may well have been a custom application, but if there is a commercial
product that does this, I would be interested in knowing who to contact.

Thank you,

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200411151617.AA1714500pd80000426610@gard.com>

This question is regarding brick masonry facades for high-rise buildings 
(more than 3 stories).   I am looking for "plastic" ties/masonry anchors 
for use in masonry facades to reduce the heat loss usually seen through the 
steel ties.  The ties will bind a 4" thick brick veneer facade to a 6" 
thick CMU block backing. The assembly includes insulation (3") and an air 
cavity (1") between the brick and block. I'd appreciate if you could let me 
know of any manufacturers/suppliers of plastic ties that you may be 
familiar with, even if they are based outside the US.

Thank you.

Sincerely,
Smita

One has to be careful about defining the shading factor. The shaded portion of the window in PREBID is treated as the opaque part of the window which may have a very different U-value than that of the glass (glazing). The heat conducted across the window will be affected if a glazing forms significantly large portion of the wall.

Let me explain by the following example (a single glazed window with wooden frame).

If the shading coefficient is 0.5, beam and diffuse radiation will pass through 50% of the area of the glass. The remaining 50% of glass area would be treated as wood.

In reality, heat conduction will take place through the remaining 50% of the glass area (it should not be treated as wood).  (Imagine the difference when the conductivity of glass = 2.88 kJ/m-K and the conductivity of wood = 0.54 kJ/m-K).

A better method to model shading would be to treat the beam and diffuse radiation with the shading coefficients in IISiBat before it is given as input to Type 56.

Caution: The modified radiation to be given separately for windows, it should not affect the radiation incident on the walls. This would require creating a separate surface to contain the windows only. Same caution is required also when Types 34 and 68 are used as suggested by David.

David: pl confirm the above statement.

  Dear Maurizio,


    1) I'm currently modelling in PREBID a residential building for which the montly Shading Coefficients on the windows have been calculated with the software ECOTECT. I insert the SC in the appropriate field ("external shading coefficient") as an input and set the "view factor" to 0,5 (vertical surfaces). It's the exact way? My doubt is that the solar incident radiation is halved (view factor = 0,5) and then reduced of the SC...

  It is correct, provided that the shading coefficient from Ecotect is the opaque fraction of the window (i.e. 1 = completely shaded).
  The view factor to the sky (FSky) is only used for longwave radiation so it will not interfere with shading.

  The one thing to bear in mind about PREBID's external and internal shading coefficient is that the entered fraction effects both beam and diffuse radiation equally. Thus if you enter a value of 0.5 for the external shading factor, half of the incident diffuse radiation and half of the incident beam radiation will enter the space. If you want to treat beam and diffuse radiation separately, you can use one of the external shading models (Type34, or Type68).


    2) It's possible to use old TESS libraries with TRNSYS 16 or are they already comprised in the new version?

  Because of the change in coding standards for components between version 15 and 16, the TESS Libraries v. 1.x are not directly useable with TRNSYS v 16. We have, however, expanded the libraries and released version 2.0, which are not only compatible with TRNSYS 16 but are also backwards compatible with TRNSYS 15. If you are interested in upgrading, you will be credited the full amount that you paid for your version 1.x libraries toward the purchase of version 2.x libraries. If you do not wish to upgrade then you can follow the steps laid out in the TRNSYS 16 documentation that show you how to modify a TRNSYS 15 Type to make it accessible from TRNSYS 16. I will send along a second email containing a document that lists the contents of the 12 version 2.0 libraries as well as an order form that contains the pricing information. I would be happy to answer any questions that you might have about them.

  Kind regards,
    David

Nesen,
I have been working in collaboration with Victor Olgyay on a design tool that runs off Microsoft Excel, that uses a building's balance point temperature to determine optimum shading angles (profile angles) for different facades. Its still in the beta test version, and I am working on getting it done within the next 3 months. I would be happy to let you, (and anyone else who is interested) try it out. I would love feedback. I'm not sure if I am allowed to send a 2+ megabyte attachment to this list, so if anyone is interested, I will be happy to reply individually with the attachment.
 
good luck

Hi all, 

I need a tool to analyze performance of the sun shading elements on the facade of a 42.000 m. square building. Any recommendations (calculation method or software) would be very helpfull... :)

Varkie, I don't know where you got the idea that steam
distributed through a district system is "waste
energy."  While about 2/3 of the energy going out the
cooling tower is from condensing steam back into
water, turbine discharge pressures at a typical power
plant are sub-atmospheric (relatively low
temperatures).  Bleed steam taken out of a point on
the turbine and put into a district system is steam
that is not generating all the electric power that it
could.  

Keith

PS The likely reason that summer rates are being
offered is to boost sales and improve load factor in
the non-heating season.

At the end of this message is the part load performance of steam turbine
chillers.  As you can see from the response from Rob Firnstein of York,
energy software developers can incorporate this data into their
programs. 

 

Steam turbine chillers have recently been specified for buildings in
NYC.  ConEd has low summer rates for steam.  Cities like Boston,
Minneapolis and Philadelphia also provide district steam.  Since
district steam is waste energy from a power plant perhaps there should
be LEED credits for using this waste energy although the ECB method
might show higher costs over electric centrifugal.

Subject: RE: Steam Turbine YK rating

 

Varkie,

 

Feel free to forward on the information. Recently, York re-designed the

software for selecting our steam turbine chillers so that we now have

greater capability to pair compressors and steam turbines for optimum

performance. If you are interested in seeing any generic selections for

additional chillers please let me know.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200411111724.AA244215pd80000421465@gard.com>

We are involved in a statewide study of higher education energy use,
efficiency and energy management. One of the (rather minor) tasks is to
identify exemplary programs in other higher education systems and
facility groups that could be used for education of the facility
managers and/or policy and financial interests (re: Legislature, Board
of Regents, ...).  We know of a few but don't want to assume we know
them all, or even know all about the ones we know of. 
 
Particular areas of interest are:
Energy Master Planning (campus wide interaction of energy with other
master plan activities)
Innovative procurement (supply side - not performance contracting)
Energy management (bill tracking, prioritizing, cost management,
budgeting, etc.)
Greyware management (training, outreach, student involvement,
behavioral, etc.)
 
 
If any of you know of, or are involved in something like this, I'd
appreciate a quick note. Thanks.

There are a number of tools available which
deal specifically with sun shading elements.

(from the Building Tools Directory:  www.energytoolsdirectory.gov ):

LESO-SHADE:  http://lesowww.epfl.ch/
Solar Tool: http://www.squ1.com/

ShadowFX:   http://www.shadowfx.co.uk/
Overhang:   http://www.susdesign.com/
Awnshade:   http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/

More introductory information on each tool is given in the Tools Directory.

Also, all of the energy simulation programs calculate the impact of sun
shading devices.

I need a tool to analyze performance of the sun shading elements on the
facade of a 42.000 m. square building. Any recommendations (calculation
method or software) would be very helpfull... :)

Nesen,

Please elaborate. If you need just visual analysis a 3D tool like SketchUp 
would be great or on a little more  involved level the Sun Tool module of 
Ecotect.

If you need thermal performance you might consider a whole building analysis 
tool like eQuest.

Hope this helps.

I have another article coming up, and would

where phone apps are being used, especially in 
energy-related situations. 

Not the Nextel phone-to-phone communication
stuff, but Java/C/etc apps on phones, or similar

Please contact me by email if you have an
experience to share.

Hello,

 

I am trying to simulate (using DOE2) the effect of nighttime pre-cooling of underfloor air plenum with outside air to take advantage of the thermal mass of the floor slab to reduce space peak cooling load and annual cooling energy consumption. There is no direct way to model this in DOE2. Any idea on what is the best way to emulate this effect using DOE2?

 

Thank you

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] LEED Measurement and Verification Credit
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200411301633.AA3358296pd80000444007@gard.com>

Hopefully this is not straying too far away from simulation discussions,
but....
 
Is anyone familiar, or had any experience, with the USGBC's LEED Energy
and Atmosphere Measurement and Verification Credit?  I am aware that
there is much written out there about the IPMVP, but I was looking for
specific information from people who have done M&V work specifically to
achieve the LEED credit.  I am wondering if any US LEED projects have
actually obtained this credit besides the Chicago Center for Green
Technology and the Donald Bren School of Environmental Science &
Management.  I am going to give a presentation to the local USGBC
chapter on the credit and I wondered if any other Bldg-Sim listers have
experiences that I could refer to in my presentation.  Any information
on costs to meet the credit would be especially appreciated.

I would like to sincerely thank all those who provided leads and
information in response to my recent request. I've received well over 20
replies and am overwhelmed by  your assistance. If things work out, I'll
take the relative information we include in our report, repackage it and
and maybe add to it and send it to the lists servers. It promises to be
an interesting compilation.
