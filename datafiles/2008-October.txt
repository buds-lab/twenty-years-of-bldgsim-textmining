At first glance, I would double check your insulation and window
values....you've got glass with a U-value of 1.2, exterior wall
insulation of R-3, and roof insulation of LESS than R-1.  This is partly
why your heating energy consumption is so large.

In addition, values like this will mean that your max zone supply
temperature of 95, and max reheat of 42 degrees, are probably not going
to be sufficient to heat the space to 70 degrees at all times.

I've been beating my head against the wall trying to figure this out.
The attached inp and pd2 file are the 90.1 baseline for a model which
works.  I have many many unmet heating hours.  The ctrls options were
not changed between my design and the baseline, only the system type.
Can someone with more equest experience help me?

Hello my Energy Modeling Friends:

I had a question about defining the baseline with respect to a LEED energy model.  My local state code has a slightly more stringent energy code then 90.1 for our region, but I haven't found anywhere in LEED NC v2.2 that my baseline has to be defined with respect to my Local Energy code.  I know in other LEED credits that they require you to use the more stringent code when showing LEED compliance, but I can't find that same instruction with respect to defining the Baseline model per Appendix G.  Have any of you had experience with this, and can say whether I have to meet my Local Code with the baseline or just Appendix G?

Thank you for your help and input.

Sincerely,
Josh

Hi, everyone!

I need to model an office building with one package terminal for each

Please, I need your help.

Dear Josh

There is in general no single answer to your question. The energy
performance rating method and Appendix G is concerned with establishing a
benchmark you can compare your building with. The benchmark is the baseline
building. As a benchmark building, there is no goal from a LEED perspective
to make this a quality building with the strictest building code possible
applied. Rather, the rating authorities seek to make it a standardized
benchmark to which all buildings can be compared, across all parts of the
world regardless of local standards. Other parts of the LEED certification
seeks to improve the quality of your building as much as possible, and
forces you to apply the strictest code possible, as you point out.

Generally, local code must be met in your baseline building if it is met in
your proposed building, but there are many exceptions. Appendix G first
states that the proposed and baseline building should be identical. Appendix
G then proceeds to describe the only ways you are allowed to let the two
models differ. This means that given that you are designing your proposed
building in accordance with local code, your baseline building will also
have to comply with this code except for the parameters which Appendix G
lets differ between the proposed and baseline buildings. There are therefore
times you will have to let your baseline model comply with local code, and
times where you do not have to. I am listing a few examples:

Cases where baseline building must comply with local code:

Many times, your baseline building must comply with local codes. For
instance if your local code forces you to limit vertical fenestration to 35%
of your building gross above-grade wall area, then this will also be the
case for the baseline building, in accordance with Table G3.1, No. 5 in
ASHRAE 90.1-2004. Another aspect of your baseline building that will have to
comply with local code is any regulation on dimensions. Appendix G clearly
states that the baseline building dimensions must be equivalent to the
proposed design in the same section as mentioned above.

Note also that the prerequisite of applying Appendix G is to comply with
sections 5.4, 6.4, 7.4, 8.4, 9.4, and 10.4 of 90.1. In at least one
instance, these requirements force you to apply local code (see section
6.4.3.8). I don't know these standards by heart, so you will have to read
through them and find out exactly where local code might be prescribed.

Cases where your baseline building does not have to comply with local code:

However, Table G3.1 lists parameters that will be different in the baseline
and proposed buildings. In these instances, if local code places
restrictions on lighting power, for example, then your baseline building
will not have to meet local standards. Instead, you will be rewarded for
complying with local regulations stricter than 90.1, as the baseline
building will have lighting power determined by section 9.2 of ASHRAE
90.1-2004.

Another example is if local code places restrictions on efficiencies of HVAC
equipment. In this case you model equipment in accordance with Appendix G
for the baseline building, which might be less stringent than local
requirements used in your proposed building. You will then be rewarded for
complying with local code as the energy consumption of the proposed building
will be lower than for the baseline building.

So keep in mind that in general baseline and proposed building should be
modeled identically. Then, let your baseline building differ only in the
ways stipulated by Appendix G, which sometimes allow you to let your
baseline building perform worse than what local code requires.

Good luck with your model and feel free to contact me for any further
clarification.

Message-ID: <343a1a270810020555h1b2a61a0qa4246f0b62e71d4b@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I have trouble interpreting this section of Appendix G, ASHRAE 90.1-2004 for
my application.

My application is 4 million square feet and uses district cooling. The
cooling load is met by fan coils which are placed in nearly every room
throughout the building. There is also a small fan coil near each air
intake. There are many (more than 50) separate air intakes, some of which
draw less than 5000 cfm. There is no mixing of return air. All the air
provided to the spaces is 100% outdoor air, and the air removed from the
spaces is exhausted directly to the outside.

Here are my questions:

1 - Does the term "Individual fan systems" in the text of this section refer
to the fan system in the proposed or baseline building?

2 - In my case, where there are many small fans serving a very large
building, does the limit of 5000 cfm refer to the capacity of each of these
individual fans, or the sum total of the capacities in the entire building?

3 - It seems the limit of 70% or greater of outdoor air in supply air is
meant for a system like VAV. In my system it is impractical to mix air,
since the cooling happens locally at each fan coil, and the supply air is
equal to the outdoor air provided. Even though I don't draw more air than an
equivalent VAV system with less than 70% of outdoor air in the supply air,
must I still model a recovery wheel?

4 - Is the 70% limit discussed above referring to the system in the proposed
or baseline building?

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely yours,

Hi, all:

 

I remember seeing a post on this list about a year ago that mentioned a

Thanks,

	Built-Up Area
Message-ID: <343a1a270810050926vcc55b40i1044da7d67d415f3@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all:

The sum of the areas of all the rooms in my building does not match the
architect's reported built-up area. I know this stems from the fact that I
am measuring the floor area of each room, not including the walls. I am also
excluding mechanical risers.

Here are my questions:

1 - Has anyone had problems using a different total area for the energy
simulation report (in EAc1) than for the built-up area stated elsewhere in
the LEED submittal documents?

2 - Has the USGBC ever rejected an application because of this?

3 - If yes to any of the above, how did you deal with this issue?

4 - How do you measure the area of the rooms in your buildings, do you
measure mid-wall-to-mid-wall or do you trace the walls in each room
(excluding the area the walls cover)?

Thank you for any help!

Sincerely yours,

We've been corrected by the USGBC when using different area numbers 
throughout the online submission templates. To correct the problem we 
changed the areas to match the energy model because it was already 
completed, with much work done in eQuest's detailed interface. We 
re-submitted after the Design Submittal comments and were given the 
green light...

I measure from the exterior wall perimeter as that is what I can recall 
Marlin Addison recommending, though I could be wrong in my recollection. 
I also include all areas and mark unconditioned areas as such.

Hope this helps!

The USGBC reviewers do look for consistency across the entire LEED
submission.  Inconsistencies in reported square footage of the project has
certainly been questioned but usually only if the reported values are far
different from one another.  It is not expected that the square footage
reported in the energy model matches precisely the square footage reported
for other credits; it is expected that the square footage values reported
throughout the submission are fairly close to one another.  There are
certainly valid reasons why the square footages would differ slightly as
mentioned below.

 

A disparity in square footages may be a reason to reject an individual
credit (SSc5.2, Option 2 achievement depends upon the building square
footage) but it would not be a valid reason for rejecting an entire
submission.

All energy use in a building must be modeled according to the modeling
protocols.  It does not matter whether it is regulated or not by 90.1.
Cooking would be applicable to a commercial cooking facility like in a
school or restaurant.

All,

 

I'm a newbie to eQuest and not that familiar with the warnings.

 

After re-entering the wizard mode and creating additional floor plates
to my current model, I got a "0 delayed floor and 0 delayed ceiling"
warning when exiting the Building Creation Wizard. Any ideas whether
this is a problem and/or how I could go about fixing it!?

 

Many thanks,

 

Alexej

Message-ID: <3BBCBF3E24390749A2059774C10007A202C40AF7@HMP107.hilson_moran.local>

Dear all,
has anyone ever tried to do a LEED energy modeling using the software
IES VE?
I am modelling the baseline building with it (with the ApacheHVAC
module) and I don't know how to input the part-load performance of the
supply fan for a system 8 (VAV with reheat).
I cannot simply input the coefficients given in table G3.1.3.15 of
ASHRAE 90.1  for part-load ratio and fraction of full-load power as IES
VE requires to define the fan curve with flow, pressure and efficiency
for each point. 
I tried with a fixed pressure and applying the relation Power=(Flow x
Pressure)/Efficiency, but this is not correct because the pressure also
varies! So I have 2 unknown quantities and only 1 equation!
How can I work out the pressure and efficiency for each point in the
curve given the flow at each point, the full-load power of the fan and
table G3.1.3.15? 
Has anyone ever had this problem before?

Lixing,
I will be creating a case study that demos central (perhaps cogen) plant with district heating and cooling.   I have done this with DOE2.1E at SOM.  I need to create a generic model (in DOE2.1E and eQUEST) for public distribution.  You can open and look at 3 other case study PDF reports based on real projects from the IIT energy seminar website below.  Attached is a summary of the seminar. There might still be a few seats left.  I now live in Minneapolis.

Aaron,
 
The loop to loop heat pump chiller works only with a lake/well type condenser water loop.  Have you considered using a heat recovery chiller for your application?

Message-ID: <94590C9AC072E74A8CFCFB5014B2CD278FFAE4@bdspserver04.BDSPUK02.local>

Hi all,

 

I'm doing a LEED EAc1/ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G calculation where the
building is served by a district cooling scheme and the basecase
building is serviced by PTHP (ASHRAE 90.1 table G3.1.1A), i.e. the
basecase building is uses electrically powered DX coils compared to
purchased chilled water coils for the proposed building.  

 

The problem I have is that the price per kWh of chilled water is very
close to the local price per kWh of electricity, which means that the
cooling energy cost of the proposed building ends up much larger - for
the PTHP system 1kWh of electricity gives something like 3kWh of
cooling, but the same money only gets 1kWh of cooling from the district
scheme, which makes it virtually impossible to get any LEED EAc1
credits.  Has anyone else encountered this issue?

 

Thanks for your help,

 

Andy

If the condenser and recovery loop are in series, it is probably done to
protect the system from having the condensing loop oversized. I had to
address this concern in the supermarket industry a number of years ago.
A particular supermarket chain purchased the same model of heat recovery
for every store regardless of the size and amount of refrigeration in
each store. This resulted in some smaller stores having an oversized
heat recovery system. This is primarily a concern for part load
operation.

 

If the refrigerant changes to liquid before it hits the condenser, the
condenser becomes a refrigerant tank. What effectively happens is that
the system's volume of refrigerant (as liquid phase in the condenser)
starves the evaporators. In the case I spoke of, the maintenance people
then added refrigerant to the system which worked until the system
neared design load again and then the system tripped on high head. This
produced an endless cycle of adding/removing refrigerant until we had
the owner resize the heat recovery loop.

 

And, our standard as refrigeration engineers, was to size the heat
recovery system for no more than 50% credit for this very reason.

I have a similar scenario although mine is on the heating side.  In my case the proposed building is using purchased heat via a low-temp geothermal water source that can be purchased from the local District.  The baseline is required by App G to be VAV w/ reheat using design supply hot water temp = 180 deg F.  The geothermal source is 110 deg, so it can't be used in the baseline scheme with standard hot water heating coils.  This situation is different than Andy's in that using the geothermal source results in a tremendous cost savings to the owner.  The proposed system will use Water-Water Heat Pumps to take about a 65 degree temperature drop out of the 110 deg source.  The cost of the source is based on gallons usage, with no regard for heat transfer.  The rate schedule is set to be equivalent to the cost of natural gas assuming a 20 deg temperature drop.  So in essence, every degree the system can take out past 20 deg is free heating energy, which I'm hoping the modeling protocol allows credit for.

So, I am interested if there is any insight out there on what to do when the baseline and proposed systems utilize separate utilities.

Thanks,

 Dan Russell, EIT

I received an off-list reply to my query which pointed me towards the
following LEED document:

http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=4176

 

The document describes an alternative procedure for cases where you have
district thermal energy schemes (it covers both heating and cooling).  

 

Hope that helps,

 

Andy

supply hot water temp = 180 deg F.  The geothermal source is 110 deg, so
it can't be used in the baseline scheme with standard hot water heating
coils.  This situation is different than Andy's in that using the
geothermal source results in a tremendous cost savings to the owner.
The proposed system will use Water-Water Heat Pumps to take about a 65
degree temperature drop out of the 110 deg source.  The cost of the
source is based on gallons usage, with no regard for heat transfer.  The
rate schedule is set to be equivalent to the cost of natural gas
assuming a 20 deg temperature drop.  So in essence, every degree the
system can take out past 20 deg is free heating energy, which I'm hoping
the modeling protocol allows credit for.

 

So, I am interested if there is any insight out there on what to do when
the baseline and proposed systems utilize separate utilities.

 

Thanks,

 

 Dan Russell, EIT

Subject: [Bldg-sim] ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Purchased Chilled Water

 

Hi all,

 

I'm doing a LEED EAc1/ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G calculation where the
building is served by a district cooling scheme and the basecase
building is serviced by PTHP (ASHRAE 90.1 table G3.1.1A), i.e. the
basecase building is uses electrically powered DX coils compared to
purchased chilled water coils for the proposed building.  

 

The problem I have is that the price per kWh of chilled water is very
close to the local price per kWh of electricity, which means that the
cooling energy cost of the proposed building ends up much larger - for
the PTHP system 1kWh of electricity gives something like 3kWh of
cooling, but the same money only gets 1kWh of cooling from the district
scheme, which makes it virtually impossible to get any LEED EAc1
credits.  Has anyone else encountered this issue?

 

Thanks for your help,

 

Andy

Hi all,
         I was trying to incorporate a turbocor chiller model in eQUEST,
since it does not have one. I have calculated the coefficients for this
chiller.

Any help would be appreciated.

Is there any way to model a water cooled refrigeration condenser in the eQuest 3.61 version.

When you create the condenser there are only three options, Air Cooled, Evaporative, and Cascaded.  Is there a work around to model it as water cooled?

Is just the addition going for LEED certification?  Also, make sure no hvac
systems are connected with the existing building.  Then probably system3.

Well - actually the existing building is also going for certification
and is in the final processes. This is really its own separate building
- except for the fact that it sits directly above the other building.

Hi all,

I'm using parametric runs to create an efficiency package based on prioritizing select energy efficiency measures in order of greatest energy savings when compared to a baseline building. Some of my efficiency measures are modeled using a new INP file, which the parametric run references in 3.63. My results are not coming out as expected, and even the baseline run is being modified with characteristics of a reference INP file. Has anyone else had buggy issues related to this feature in the latest version of eQUEST? I'm looking for guidance on how I can model the desired package of EEMs.

Thanks,

Allison

Message-ID: <D65B59C368485A40A6F4C90ADE06B8C7356B7036D1@exchange01.dynamix-ltd.com>

Hello all,

I've been beating my head in trying to get my design heating load down. I have been looking at the neat little summary tab for the air side hvac. Having been unable to get the heating load to be lower than ~60 (Btu/h per sf) or even lower that the cooling load, I decided to look at the detailed report. Looking at the  SS-D report I see that the maximum heating load works out to be approximately 34(Btu/h per sf)! Is that correct? Where does the summery tab get its information?

Another way to check whether my heating is reasonable is to check the annual use, I assume. The only problem is I have no idea what that is. Currently the system uses 830 MBtu. Any help would be great!

thanks

Allison,

Are you using the Energy Efficiency Measures Wizard?

I have experienced a bug with eQUEST 3.63 while using the EEM Wizard.  When
I change my Air-Side System Type for a Whole Site/Building EEM, eQUEST
automatically closes.

Can anyone duplicate this?

Message-ID: <19d90a140810160135p57a7b6bdmd7db66d2c68f0571@mail.gmail.com>

Hi:



I'm working on putting together a project for the boy scout troop that I
lead.  We are attempting to teach them about living in a sustainable future,
and prepare the troop for the real world with real job skills.  We want to
use eQuest to simulate a building that we already have a bunch of data
collected, including end uses of all the end uses in the building, which we
collected ourselves using sensors and data collectors.  We have a weather
station, and so also have a lot of real-time weather data that we'd like to
convert into .bin files for eQuest to properly read.  In order to produce an
accurate modelling scenario, we will need to use this real time weather data
in our simulation.  Does anyone have any experience making custom weather
files?  I have tried to follow the advice in the sections of the
downloadable content, but am having trouble making it work.  Getting pesky
errors, without much information about the cause.



Sincerely,
Pedro

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Fraction of Hour Chiller Operates calculation
Message-ID: <C05DB12F67CF7B4EA1021A1E8E7EF0FE02639A99@servus-exch1.main.root.tac.com>

I am trying to sift through how eQuest calculates a chiller's end
electrical usage and I am stuck on the fraction of hour the chiller
operates. 
The DOE-2 engineers manual says it is calculated as follows:
 
FRAC = PL / RMIN,
 
where PL is the average part load ratio over the hour, calculated as:
 
PL = ALOAD / CAP,
 
where ALOAD is the assigned hourly load and CAP is the corrected
operating capacity.
 
RMIN is the part load ratio of rated load at which the chiller can
operate continuously.
 
I have used some of the calculated values in the hourly report and
cannot verify how eQuest is calculating this FRAC amount.
 
Does anyone have some insight? 
 

Thanks,

Well it takes about 628 Watt-hours (2260 kJ) to evaporate one kg of
water. One kg = 2.2 lb. So 285 Wh/lb water evaporation. Divide your
W/person by 285 Wh/lb and you should get lb/[hr*person]. Right? It's
friday afternoon, I could be wrong...

Message-ID: <e70580c60810171555m59c29e2bt7033780da331019b@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,
              I am modelling an 124,000sqft five storied building in eQUEST
3.61. I am benchmarking the model's electricity, demand and gas use using
the actual billing usage. I am able to benchmark the electricity and demand
use  but not the gas usage. I am able to get pretty good streamlining in
summer but not in winter. In winter the total therms is up by 154% of the
normal billing usage.

Does eQUEST overestimates the gas usage.

Any clue, help or direction would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

What type of HVAC system do you have?  If it is a VAV, it sounds like
your system is functioning fine (summer is when VAV matching wreaks
havoc).
 
Check your winter outside air, window type, operating hours (do you heat
at night ??).

Message-ID: <29CC4E9A12696047AE18D685250EA2A10484CE@msi1.corp.mullinaxsolutions.com>

On three or four occasions I have used equest to compare traditional,
small split systems (three to five ton) to a water source heat pump
system in the same building.  The WSHP system uses a cooling tower and a
small boiler.  

 

I tried to make everything else identical by creating the first model
and saving a copy of that model and changing the HVAC type from split
system to WSHP.

 

On every occasion, split systems end up using significantly less energy
than water source heat pumps systems.

The WSHPs are typically 16 SEER, the Splits 13 SEER.

 

 

I know there is additional energy associated with pumps and cooling
towers. Is this a typical result?  

It seems I've heard a lot of high about the efficiency of water source
heat pumps.

It may depend on the pumping and controls you have for the WSHP loop.  If
you are not using a variable speed drive pump, (and three-way valves) for
the WSHP system, then this would account for additional pumping energy.
What program are you using?  Using eQuest, I've had good results with WSHP
systems, it's possible that when you change the system type, it's not
changing over very well.

Can you send results (or if you're using eQuest, your inp and pd2 files).

The energy end-use comparison report should show where the two runs
are using energy differently.

This would help you determine if the difference is cooling, heating,
pumps or towers.

Also check that your models performed equally in terms of unmet hours.

The comparison also depends on climate condition (mild winter?) and building type and zoning pattern (potential for recovering heat among different zones?). If you use air source heat pump, check the defrosting control, winter shut-off temperature set point, etc. Make sure the operation of the simulated air source heat pump is realistic.

Ensure your fan operation is consistently "constant".  If fans are 
"intermittent", OA is only introduced when the fan is on -- and the fan 
run hours are likely different between the two system types depending on 
capacity & control -- which will skew your results.

Has anyone tried to model an external green wall? If so, any help on how
to do this would be great.

 

Thanks

Hi Patrick,

In general, green walls can be modeled as a wall with a shading device. Make
sure the shading is very close to the wall. There will be very little
insulating effect from the leaves, and they are not an efficient wind
breakers. Make sure the vegetation for the plant type specified is dense
enough to shade the entire wall. Else, you might want to shade only parts of
the wall proportionally to the density of the vegetation. Make sure you are
not shading the windows, as these are usually kept free from vegetation.

Also, you must pay attention to whether the wall itself is significantly
altered due to the vegetation. The most common green walls have the plant
rooted in the ground with only minor attachment points on the wall. In this
case you model the wall like any other wall. However, sometimes plants are
grown on the wall itself, with small shelves filled with earth. If this is
the case, you must make sure you model the areas filled with earth if they
occupy significant parts of the wall.

Lastly, the attachment points for the plant may in some instances have
significant effects on the thermal performance of the wall. Make sure you
incorporate this in your model if it applies to your building.

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Sincerely yours,

Message-ID: <25F2BDB6656B8F40A1289ED906D6B5CF038E117F@EXCHANGE1.cadd_group.ghtltd.com>

I'm working on a project where I am pursuing LEED EAc1 for an existing
building.  As I understand it from the LEED-NC reference guide, as well
as from some snippets of 90.1, I actually model the baseline building as
is currently exists.  The reference guide says:
 
"For existing buildings that are being renovated, the building envelope
design parameters for the Baseline Design should be modeled using the
existing (pre-retrofit) building envelope thermal parameters rather than
the ASHRAE 90.1 prescriptive building envelope requirements for the
specified climate."
 
So I'm using actual window areas, actual insulation values, etc.
 
My question is:  if I'm using this exception, do I also no longer have
to do a simulation at the four different azimuth required by the LEED
EAc1 template?
 
I find 90.1, as well as the user's manual, fairly lacking in describing
how to apply Appendix G to existing buildings in general....
 
Thanks in advance!

James,

It is my understanding that it is not necessary to do the rotation on an
existing building.  I am also working on an existing building, and I
plan to submit without rotating.  This topic has been debated on the
forum in the past with opposing opinions, each side having reasonable
arguments, but if my memory is correct the best/last argument was that
existing buildings do not need to be rotated.  I think this position
makes more intuitive sense, too.

I don't believe a definitive resource exists for this question, which is

Kevin,

I have since reversed my stance; Eric O'Neill was kind enough to provide
me with the following link:

http://lists.onebuilding.org/htdig.cgi/bldg-sim-onebuilding.org/2007-Nov
ember/005709.html

I had not come across this thread before, and it sounds like existing
buildings need to be rotated regardless of the situation.

as from some snippets of 90.1, I actually model the baseline building as
is currently exists.  The reference guide says:
 
"For existing buildings that are being renovated, the building envelope
design parameters for the Baseline Design should be modeled using the
existing (pre-retrofit) building envelope thermal parameters rather than
the ASHRAE 90.1 prescriptive building envelope requirements for the
specified climate."
 
So I'm using actual window areas, actual insulation values, etc.
 
My question is:  if I'm using this exception, do I also no longer have
to do a simulation at the four different azimuth required by the LEED
EAc1 template?
 
I find 90.1, as well as the user's manual, fairly lacking in describing
how to apply Appendix G to existing buildings in general....
 
Thanks in advance!

Hello everybody:

Has any one got an idea about how to compile or generate weather data
files of
EPW or TMY extensions for example from simulation raw data output files,
i.e.
*.txt, *.DAT, *.STAT?

A help would be appreciated.
Best regards,
Mohamad.

Shaojie,

Check to make sure that you are not recovering heat during hours that
you can be using the economizer.  Choose the Control Sequences:
Operation: "When Minimum OA" so that the heat recovery device will only
operate when you cannot benefit from free cooling.

Gary,

A dual enthalpy type economizer would be recommended rather than a dry
bulb type.  In either case the number of econmizer hours would be less
for a warm/humid climate than for a temperate northern climate.  My
response to Shaojie was aimed at trying to troubleshoot why his cooling
load increased with the heat recovery.  Extra fan heat doesn't seem to
be the cause because fan energy consumption was forced to not increase
with the heat recovery.

Mike

Mike,
 
I agree with you. "Free Cooling" via Economizer is a great concept for
the Northern Climates.
 
The Florida / Texas Coast line however have a major problem with
Humidity.
 
Once the structure is balanced, the humidity removed, I question even
the Moderate or Mild Climate periods of the year for economizer use in
some climates.  Can Mechanical ventilation allow a dry bulb controller
to be  set at a higher temperature in the summer months?  Logic is that
structure is sealed so that zero infiltration occurs and grains per
pound are removed via a wet evaporator coil? 
 
What is the solution for ERV and Economizer use for the Humid climates?

 
 
Thanks,
Gary

The eQUEST default for temperature control is FLOAT whereby the heat 
recovery device aims to maximize heat recovery for all ambient 
conditions.  This leads to heat recovery when economizer free cooling 
would be preferable.

With "Mixed Air Reset", the device is modulated, either by bypassing air 
or by modulating the heat exchanger (slowing the wheel), to maintain the 
mixed air temperature at the mixed air temperature setpoint -- which is 
typically the supply air temperature setpoint less a couple of degrees 
for fan pick-up.  This is definitely a common building automation system 
strategy.

 my 2 cents..
 
I can attest first hand to having witnessed ERV systems operating in a
"FLOAT" mode that were using chilled water for cooling on a 50-degree day
because heat recovery increased SAT to ~67F and they then proceeded to cool
SA back down to 55F.
 
I believe equest folks made the ERV default "FLOAT" so that people would at
least stop and think about the fact that an improperly designed ERV system
will actually increase energy use.

The eQUEST default for temperature control is FLOAT whereby the heat
recovery device aims to maximize heat recovery for all ambient conditions.
This leads to heat recovery when economizer free cooling would be
preferable.

With "Mixed Air Reset", the device is modulated, either by bypassing air or
by modulating the heat exchanger (slowing the wheel), to maintain the mixed
air temperature at the mixed air temperature setpoint -- which is typically
the supply air temperature setpoint less a couple of degrees for fan
pick-up.  This is definitely a common building automation system strategy.

Shaojie,



Check to make sure that you are not recovering heat during hours that

you can be using the economizer.  Choose the Control Sequences:

Operation: "When Minimum OA" so that the heat recovery device will

only

operate when you cannot benefit from free cooling.

Hi,

 

I model a PSZ system with exhaust air heat recovery. I set the static

pressures of supply/exhaust fans as zero in ERV tab. Therefore, the fan

energy is the same with or without ERV. However, there is an increasing

cooling load in the cooling model. I changed the hourly report and

didn't find the reason. Any suggestions are highly appreciated.

 

Thanks

I have recently tried to create a model of a arbitrary building for a

However, the rendering shows only the top floor, the first floor and
only 1 middle floor. The top floor is suspended above the first floor
presumably by the floor to floor height value I entered. Does anyone
have any ideas to why this happens.

Yes -

In the first screen of the shell wizard the "Floor Multiplier" check box 
is selected.  This will create a top floor, a bottom floor and a middle 
floor with a multiplier for the number of storeys of the shell less 2 
(for the top & bottom).  This speeds calculations (especially for 
many-storey structures) and looks silly.  If you clear the check box, 
all floors will be created (which looks better and simulates slower).

You have the "floor multiplier" checkbox enabled in the Wizard.  It
simplifies the analysis by not creating multiples of the middle floors
which are identical to each other.  If you want to show the whole
building make sure that box is unchecked.  I would not suggest this for
tall buildings as the simulation really tends to slow down.

Hi Rick,

 

Here?s my methodology for making custom shapes using polygons:

 

1.	Imagine you are standing outside of the building looking squarely at
the surface.  Your first point (0,0) will be at the bottom left hand corner
? this corner will eventually correspond to the floor polygon vertex that
anchors your custom shape to the rest of the building.  
2.	Now enter the coordinates for each additional point as you travel
counter-clockwise around the shape.  All of the coordinate values will be
expressed in terms of how far away they are from the first point, (0,0), and
the actual surface (not the dimension indicated in plan views).  You will
need to use dusty geometry skills to convert plan dimensions, specifically:
Cosine = Adjacent / Hypotenuse.  You want to solve for the hypotenuse and
you get the adjacent length from plan view dimensions; measure the angle of
roof tilt with a protractor on the exterior elevations or building cross
sections.
3.	Now that you have a polygon, use it to make an exterior wall.  Under
?Location & Geometry?, set the Location as the vertex of the parent space
polygon that is located closest to the (0,0) point of the new child surface
polygon.  
4.	For non-square walls, the Tilt will be 90? and there is likely to
not be a reason to change the X, Y, or Z offsets or the Azimuth.  All of
these offsets are relative to the vertex of the parent space polygon that
anchors the child polygon.  Changing the X offset moves the child surface
along the plane defined by the parent polygon anchor point and the next
parent polygon point (counter-clockwise as viewed from above).  Changing the
Y offset moves the child surface along a plane that is normal to the X
offset.  The azimuth of the child polygon is the angle between the lower
edge of the child polygon relative to the wall defined by the parent polygon
anchor vertex.
5.	For simple sloped roofs with no eaves, change the Z offset to be the
height of the vertical walls, leave the Azimuth at 0, and make the Tilt the
angle of pitch relative to horizontal.  
6.	If a sloped roof has eaves, then the X and Y offsets need to be
changed to be sure that the (0,0) point of the child polygon is located the
correct distance from the parent space polygon anchor vertex.  The Z offset
will probably need to be slightly shorter than the height of the wall. 

 

Sorry if this is more detail than what you were looking for, but the
procedure may be helpful for others who are new to custom mode model
development.

 

I have never run across that error message - it is quite opaque.  It would
be great if eQuest were to generate more insightful error messages!

Dear delegates,

I would like to ask a favor for an urgent task.  Is there anyone could
give me some ideas on the typical energy consumption data for
residential / retail /commercial in Dubai?  In kwh/m2/yr? or break
down, if possible (e.g. Cooling load?, lighting?.. etc).

Prompt reply will be highly appreciated.

Hi Rick,

 

Here?s my methodology for making custom shapes using polygons:

 

1.	Imagine you are standing outside of the building looking squarely at
the surface.  Your first point (0,0) will be at the bottom left hand corner
? this corner will eventually correspond to the floor polygon vertex that
anchors your custom shape to the rest of the building.  
2.	Now enter the coordinates for each additional point as you travel
counter-clockwise around the shape.  All of the coordinate values will be
expressed in terms of how far away they are from the first point, (0,0), and
the actual surface (not the dimension indicated in plan views).  You will
need to use dusty geometry skills to convert plan dimensions, specifically:
Cosine = Adjacent / Hypotenuse.  You want to solve for the hypotenuse and
you get the adjacent length from plan view dimensions; measure the angle of
roof tilt with a protractor on the exterior elevations or building cross
sections.
3.	Now that you have a polygon, use it to make an exterior wall.  Under
?Location & Geometry?, set the Location as the vertex of the parent space
polygon that is located closest to the (0,0) point of the new child surface
polygon.  
4.	For non-square walls, the Tilt will be 90? and there is likely to
not be a reason to change the X, Y, or Z offsets or the Azimuth.  All of
these offsets are relative to the vertex of the parent space polygon that
anchors the child polygon.  Changing the X offset moves the child surface
along the plane defined by the parent polygon anchor point and the next
parent polygon point (counter-clockwise as viewed from above).  Changing the
Y offset moves the child surface along a plane that is normal to the X
offset.  The azimuth of the child polygon is the angle between the lower
edge of the child polygon relative to the wall defined by the parent polygon
anchor vertex.
5.	For simple sloped roofs with no eaves, change the Z offset to be the
height of the vertical walls, leave the Azimuth at 0, and make the Tilt the
angle of pitch relative to horizontal.  
6.	If a sloped roof has eaves, then the X and Y offsets need to be
changed to be sure that the (0,0) point of the child polygon is located the
correct distance from the parent space polygon anchor vertex.  The Z offset
will probably need to be slightly shorter than the height of the wall. 

 

Sorry if this is more detail than what you were looking for, but the
procedure may be helpful for others who are new to custom mode model
development.

 

I have never run across that error message - it is quite opaque.  It would
be great if eQuest were to generate more insightful error messages!

Rick,

 

I've gotten this error before too. I don't think you're doing anything
wrong, it might be a bug in the interface. I got around it by copying an
existing polygon instead of "creating from scratch", then deleting all the
existing vertices or just modifying them to what I want. For whatever
reason, when you select "Copy an Existing Object" instead of "Create from
Scratch" the error doesn't come up and it accomplishes the same thing.

 

Hope this helps,

Mike Karpman

Hello Kevin,

 

I have not yet modeled this but here is what I am planning to do:

 

1.	Determine the total floor area of zones with occupancy sensor
control.  Let's call it "Area X"
2.	Estimate the amount of time that any one zone would be unoccupied.
For purposes of this explanation, assume it is 15% (per the ASHRAE 90.1-2004
Table G3.2). 
3.	Multiply "Area X" by 15% to determine an equivalent floor area that
would be unoccupied continuously.  Let's call this "Area Y"
4.	Look at all of your zones used to develop "Area X" and determine the
relative proportion of areas that have north, east, south, west exposures
and are in the core of the building.  Let's call the proportion of area in
the north exposure "N"
5.	Multiply "Area Y" by each of these different proportions (e.g. "Area
Y" x "N") to determine how much unoccupied space needs to be represented.
Review your list of "Area X" zones to find the ones with approximately the
correct floor area corresponding to the requirements for the different
exposures - these will be normally unoccupied spaces.  Depending on how the
zones were initially modeled, you may need to split some zones to make
specialized "unoccupied" zones (this could get pretty time intensive unless
you anticipate having to do this when the model geometry is assembled).  The
purpose of going through the hassle of identifying zones in each of the
different exposures is to model the impact of occupancy sensor control on
the average space.  
6.	Within the normally unoccupied zones, set the minimum airflow in the
Airside Systems/Zone/Airflow tab to 0 cfm and change the occupancy, plug,
lighting, heating, and cooling schedules to use an unoccupied schedule (use
the "FRACTION ALWAYS OFF YEAR", "COOLING SETBACK YEAR", and "HEATING SETBACK
YEAR" schedules you have already made).

 

It seems like this approach could potentially work and would be fairly
accurate for a building where the aggregate unoccupied periods are
distributed randomly throughout the typical workday.  If there are separate
mechanical systems, the procedure above would need to be replicated for each
system.  This approach would probably work for a typical office but may not
work for an operation with mandatory lunch hours.  In reality, the typical
zone would probably not float all the way back to its unoccupied setpoint
since the unoccupied periods during normal building hours will be fairly
brief (<1 hr?).  Assuming that some zones are always at setback temperatures
does decrease conduction gain/losses, however, this component of space load
is generally small relative to solar, equipment, and lighting loads during
occupied periods in  non-residential spaces.  The most significant
uncertainty in this approach is the guesstimate of the fraction of time that
the typical space will be unoccupied.

 

If there are periods when many zones are likely to be unoccupied at the same
time, things can get a bit more complicated.  Specialized schedules can be
made for occupancy, plug, lighting, heating and cooling, and you would need
to use the minimum airflow schedule option in Airside Systems/Zone/Airflow.


 

Is this what others have done?  Does it seem reasonable?

 

Eric

for determining energy cost savings for LEED. The building is in NY. I
searched the eia.doe.gov site but couldn't find anything.

 

Thanks,

Bill

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Dubai Ecotect Weather File?
Message-ID: <65F57AB7CE4C4DCE8365F56ED477ECD6@ads.Kasianroot.com>

I know this has been asked before, but I can not find any working link: I am
looking for a weather file for Dubai that is either WEA format or some other
format that I can easily convert to be used in Ecotect.

I found the file for Abu Dhabi 100 km north on the EnergyPlus Weather Data
site but I suspect there might be differences in the local weather that will
affect our preliminary design studies.

Bill-

I have worked on alot of university projects that have their own central
plants and from my experience the price of chilled water and hot water will
vary from university to university---especially if schools are using co- or
tri-gen central plants.  You should ask the client to provide you with the
rates.  Sorry I could not be of any more help.

Hello,

 

I asked a question a few weeks ago about whether or not you have to rotate the Baseline building in a LEED-NC EAc1 calculation (or Appendix G calculation for some other reason).  Thank you everyone for your replies (see below)...it appears that yes, you do need to perform the four (4) separate runs for each direction.

 

However, I have a more general question about modeling renovations to existing buildings.  According to the LEED-NC reference guide, you are to model the Baseline building (if it is existing) with the same "thermal parameters" as the existing building.  Appendix G, Table G3.1 Section 5f) says that "For Existing building envelopes, the baseline building design shall reflect existing conditions prior to any revisions that are part of the scope of work...".  

 

Futhermore, the reference guide goes on to say that "For projects served by existing HVAC systems, such as a central plant on a campus, Section 10(a) of Table G3.1 states that when there is an existing HVAC system, the model shall reflect the actual system type using actual component capacities and efficiencies."

 

But this section is actually under the "Proposed" column, and I can't find anywhere where it specifically says that the Baseline system should be modeled as the existing building currently stands.

 

So I have two questions:

 

1)       If you have an existing building, is the HVAC system supposed to be modeled as it currently exists in the Baseline model, as well as things like the thermal parameters, etc?  What about the lighting?  If you have an existing building that you KNOW has a lighting density of 2.0 Watts / sq ft pre-retrofit, is that how you should model the Baseline building?

 

2)      If I have an existing building that happens to have one exposure with NO windows, and part of the renovation is to install windows on that side of the building, while STILL BEING BELOW 40% total window area.  How do I model the baseline building?  With windows there or not?  If not, then that is a major penalty, and in reality, I may want to compare my Proposed building to a Baseline model that is 90.1-2004 compliant.  Can you even do that if it is an existing building?  Can you choose whether to model the Baseline building it as it exists, or model it per minimum ASHRAE standards?  

 

I haven't yet received a copy of 90.1-2007.  Does Appendix G in that version clarify any of this?  

 

Thanks in advance!

Kevin,

I have since reversed my stance; Eric O'Neill was kind enough to provide
me with the following link:

http://lists.onebuilding.org/htdig.cgi/bldg-sim-onebuilding.org/2007-Nov
ember/005709.html

I had not come across this thread before, and it sounds like existing
buildings need to be rotated regardless of the situation.

James,

It is my understanding that it is not necessary to do the rotation on an
existing building.  I am also working on an existing building, and I
plan to submit without rotating.  This topic has been debated on the
forum in the past with opposing opinions, each side having reasonable
arguments, but if my memory is correct the best/last argument was that
existing buildings do not need to be rotated.  I think this position
makes more intuitive sense, too.

I don't believe a definitive resource exists for this question, which is
why I plan to "learn the hard way" on my project.  I have heard that
2009 LEED revisions will address questions specific to existing
buildings; hopefully this will be one of them.  In the interim, I would
ask that anyone with a differing opinion specify the resource guiding
them.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I'm working on a project where I am pursuing LEED EAc1 for an existing
building.  As I understand it from the LEED-NC reference guide, as well
as from some snippets of 90.1, I actually model the baseline building as
is currently exists.  The reference guide says:

"For existing buildings that are being renovated, the building envelope
design parameters for the Baseline Design should be modeled using the
existing (pre-retrofit) building envelope thermal parameters rather than
the ASHRAE 90.1 prescriptive building envelope requirements for the
specified climate."

So I'm using actual window areas, actual insulation values, etc.

My question is:  if I'm using this exception, do I also no longer have
to do a simulation at the four different azimuth required by the LEED
EAc1 template?

I find 90.1, as well as the user's manual, fairly lacking in describing
how to apply Appendix G to existing buildings in general....

Thanks in advance!

Message-ID: <490B80A0.4080904@edi-arch.com>

I am simulating a mixed-use building for LEED certification which uses 
solar thermal panels for radiant in-floor heating. There is a gas fired 
back up, but I'm curious as to whether I should use System 1 with gas 
heat or System 2 with electric heat from ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G 
Table G3.1.1A for the baseline model. System 2 is required when heating 
type is "Electric and Other," Other indicitive of Solar, but should I 
select my baseline system based on the back up fuel?

Thoughts and experience is much appreciated.
