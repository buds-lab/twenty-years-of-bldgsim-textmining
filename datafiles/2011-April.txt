Hi all,
          In my building basement which is a car parking the
ventilation fans haveCO sensors means which varies the fan cfm
according to CO lovels in the parking area and the fan have VFD contol
how can i show these savings

Is there any way to model it

There is no such module in eQuest, you can calculate this saving by
exceptional calculation.method.

Back in March of 2008, Kevin Madison presented a clever way to model CO
sensors in a parking garage in eQUEST by using the demand control
ventilation algorithm on a parking garage HVAC unit.  See the attached
excerpt from that presentation for the basic setup.

hi Varun thanks for your reply! I have another question though based on your statement that the system should be based on the 'design results'; I thought the whole point of using simulations is to predict the peak capacity required and then base your design on this? (possibly by applying safety factors according to real life experience).And how can you have unmet loads when you design based on the peak load? In that case the 'peak load' is not the maximum load?Further comments anybody? best regardsMilda

Milda,
I think if you are performorming energy simulations for the baseline, it doesnt matter what is this 25% and 15% upsizing is used for, as it used only as much capacity it needs. And your system size should be based on the design results and not simulation results (that also proposed model).


But nevertheless I always interpret this as you said in your first point, to cover uncertainity in building simulation. 
I also think it helps baseline to reduce its unmet load hours.
 
I hope this helps.

It is stated that the equipment should be oversized by a factor of 1.25 for heating and 1.15 for cooling. Are these "safety factors" based on the uncertainty associated with building energy simulations or a requirement that makes sure that the system can respond quickly enough during startup? Why are there different factors applied for heating and cooling?

Milda,

If you did notice, HAP uses two different weather files. one for design and
other for simulation. And if you dig into it you'll find out that they both
are different. The simulation weather is the real time (actual) temperature
and other data recorded at the airports for an extended period, which cannot
be overridden, while design weather data is based on extreme or peak
weather as defined by ASHRAE which you can change in the program.

Now if you are looking at LEED unmet load hours they may not be necessarily
due to air sytem size, but may also be due to your plant insufficient
capacity. Download HAP e help 014 from here :
http://www.commercial.carrier.com/commercial/hvac/general/0,,CLI1_DIV12_ETI3906_MID1738,00.html
.
In here you will find a pdf saying understanding the LEED unmet load hours
in HAP.

Simulation results is just for us to know how the building would run in real
time when sized on the design results. In simulation , HAP takes credit of
internal heat gains, which reduces your heating load, which is OK in real
time. While in design , internal heat gain is ignored in heating load
calcualtions. This is just one of the difference in simulation and design in
HAP.

I hope this helps Milda.

If there someone can define/agree upon a solution to the ?different weather data used for design and simulation? problem, we are happy to help.  We have the detailed historical data from which we can calculate the design to numbers and we have both raw observations and localized current conditions/forecasts plus an engine to post process this on the fly and deliver it specific to a site.  We are happy to work with anyone who wants to tackle this.

In simulation , HAP takes credit of internal heat gains, which reduces your heating load, which is OK in real time. While in design , internal heat gain is ignored in heating load calcualtions. This is just one of the difference in simulation and design in HAP.

I hope this helps Milda.

  And how can you have unmet loads when you design based on the peak load? In that case the 'peak load' is not the maximum load?
  Further comments anybody?

  Milda,
  I think if you are performorming energy simulations for the baseline, it doesnt matter what is this 25% and 15% upsizing is used for, as it used only as much capacity it needs. And your system size should be based on the design results and not simulation results (that also proposed model).
  But nevertheless I always interpret this as you said in your first point, to cover uncertainity in building simulation. 
  I also think it helps baseline to reduce its unmet load hours.

  I hope this helps.

Milda,

 

Just as you can use a hammer to both drive nails and extract them, all building energy simulation software is simply a tool that can be used for very different means.  

 

If you wish to use such software to aid in design/selection of HVAC equipment, then fundamentally you are arriving at design capacities by calculating design heating/cooling loads.  These use design heating/cooling weather conditions which are fundamentally different from the hourly averaged (over decades) conditions in a TMY weather file.

 

If you wish to use such software to evaluate system behavior over time, that?s a very different endgame.  A system that is 100% properly sized for capacity at design conditions can easily have ?unmet hours? as a result of something beyond capacity.  Many factors independent of capacity come into play for hourly simulations including system setback/warmup functions, economizer operation, load schedules of all sorts, part-load performance curves and sensor/thermostat settings.  These all can determine whether a zone?s conditions are met or not for the hour, in spite of whether a system is properly sized for design conditions.

 

Some software is specific to load calculations and assisting in HVAC sizing.  Some software is specifically targeted at energy modeling to simulate system behavior over time.  Some software is intended/appropriate for both functions, to varying degrees.  It?s up to the end-user to define what she/he is trying to accomplish, and what tool of choice is best for the job at hand.

 

~Nick

 

PS:  It appears you may have missed my response following Varun?s specific to 90.1 and ?safety factors? last week ? I?ve attached just in case ;).

If there someone can define/agree upon a solution to the ?different weather data used for design and simulation? problem, we are happy to help.  We have the detailed historical data from which we can calculate the design to numbers and we have both raw observations and localized current conditions/forecasts plus an engine to post process this on the fly and deliver it specific to a site.

Milda,

 

If you did notice, HAP uses two different weather files. one for design and other for simulation. And if you dig into it you'll find out that they both are different. The simulation weather is the real time (actual) temperature and other data recorded at the airports for an extended period, which cannot be overridden, while design weather data is based on extreme or peak weather as defined by ASHRAE which you can change in the program.


Now if you are looking at LEED unmet load hours they may not be necessarily due to air sytem size, but may also be due to your plant insufficient capacity. Download HAP e help 014 from here :http://www.commercial.carrier.com/commercial/hvac/general/0,,CLI1_DIV12_ETI3906_MID1738,00.html.

In here you will find a pdf saying understanding the LEED unmet load hours in HAP.

It is a guide and not a standard that has to be followed.  It is used to size equipment.  ASHRAE 99% winter design -16 degF but it can go down to -40 degF.  Actual weather data can result in overestimating and underestimating.

I am simulating a core and shell office building with system 6 for my baseline. 
The?design case is?a two pipe fan coil units at common areas and all tenants 
will have chilled water pipe provision for them to?tap their fan coil units. 
Based in CS Appendix 6?under step 1, model the HVAC system as described in the 
design documents. My question is:
1. Does that mean I will be modeling only the common since it only the areas 
that were designed?
2. Do I need to also include the tenant areas?
3. Since the tenant areas have FCU pipe provision, do I model it as FCU or do I 
have to model it as system 6 which is my baseline case?

Thank you all in advance.

Hello Jaigath,
My suggested answers follow your questions.

1. Does that mean I will be modeling only the common since it only the areas that were designed? No. You must model the whole building and site.
2. Do I need to also include the tenant areas? Yes, include the tenant spaces.
3. Since the tenant areas have FCU pipe provision, do I model it as FCU or do I have to model it as system 6 which is my baseline case? You may model the tenant spaces with FCU's in the proposed model so long as you have an engineering drawing for a typical floor showing this; if you don't have this I suggest that you ask for it. If that is not possible to obtain, perhaps a narrative from the engineer of record or the tenant lease would suffice, but I'm not 100% sure if it would. In my opinion,  you'll need to provide some documentation that the tenants must install the FCU's in order to help the GBCI reviewers understand the argument why you are modeling FCU's and not system 6.

I am simulating a core and shell office building with system 6 for my baseline. The design case is a two pipe fan coil units at common areas and all tenants will have chilled water pipe provision for them to tap their fan coil units. Based in CS Appendix 6 under step 1, model the HVAC system as described in the design documents. My question is:
1. Does that mean I will be modeling only the common since it only the areas that were designed?
2. Do I need to also include the tenant areas?
3. Since the tenant areas have FCU pipe provision, do I model it as FCU or do I have to model it as system 6 which is my baseline case?

Thank you all in advance.

To further what Shanta said:  unless you have a legally binding lease
agreement that lists specific efficiencies of the fan coil units that
the tenants must buy (or a requirement that the tenants must purchase
FCUs that match the basis of design on the contract drawings), then I
believe the fan power of those FCUs must unfortunately match the
Appendix G requirements.  In other words, you can't model an ECM motor
tenant FCU in your proposed design unless there is some enforceable
document that requires tenants to purchase them in this arrangement.

Thank you James.

That is my next question. Where to base the fcu efficiency? You said Appendix G 
but the constant volume fans are for dx units, will it be acceptable? Should I 
use system 1&2 formula or system 3&4??

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Effect of building size on energy use intensity
Message-ID: <801806.56804.qm@web24003.mail.ird.yahoo.com>

Dear all,

Building size (or floor area)  should have some influences on energy use 
intensity (Btu per sq ft). Roughly speaking, heating energy use intensity may 
decrease if the building size increases due to less surface area exposed to the 
outside. However, cooling and lighting energy intensity (usually electricity) 
may increase for the same reason.  This sounds the case from a report below 
except for small buildings (less than 5000 sq ft),
?A Look at Commercial Buildings in 1995: Characteristics, Energy Consumption, 
and Energy Expenditures? 


Anyone know there are some reports or research about detailed analysis about 
influenences of floorspace on energy use intensity?

Thanks,

Jim

Have you seen the Energy Star Technical Methodologies?

http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=evaluate_performance.bus_portfoliomanager_model_tech_desc

It shows the regressions they ran on the CBECS database to determine the Energy Star predicted Source EUI.

This delves into similar issues ? for example, in the Office Tech Description, they discuss the correlation between the natural log of Building Area and Source EUI.

Determining the occupants thermal comfort levels and the air indoor quality would be beneficial but not essential for the methodology.

Richard,



The most current publication that covers all aspects of how to rate a building's performance would be the ASHRAE Performance Metric Protocols or PMP. The PMP has three levels of evaluating the energy, water, IEQ (thermal comfort and IAQ), acoustics and lighting performance. In the PMP special emphasis was given to references for both North American and European Standards where the reader could go to learn more.



Unfortunately, assessing the thermal performance of a real building is a bit more difficult because of the compounding errors that occur when one tries to unravel the performance of the various heat transfer pathways, (i.e., the windows, walls, roof, occupants, infiltration, internal loads, etc. Furthermore, to make matters worse, the smaller  the building (i.e., residential), the worse it is to decompose the thermal components, i.e., the window SHGC from the U-value, or the infiltration.



There have been some worthy attempts that have shown certain things can be coaxed out of the data. The earliest one that I'm aware of was the PSTAR by Kris Subbarao in the early 80s. This was later picked up by folks at SERI, now NREL and carried into newer analysis, for example, the recent work with BESTEST EX by Judkoff and Neymark for residential. There was also the mid 90s work by Manke and Hittle that demonstrated the use of empirical parameters, sometimes that were physically unreasonable but gave the best fit. There was also a bit of work done by Palmiter on black and gray box methods, and the "test-hut" work published by Yaeger in the late 1980s. Other works include Mazzucchi, and Kaplan, and of course the work by Hsieh et al. at Princeton. You can pick up the thread on these by reading the literature searches in one or more of the thesis on our web site by Bronson, Bou Saada, Abbas, Song, Kim and others on calibrated simulation.



Hope this helps.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Existing building thermal performance assessment methodology?

G'day,

Can anyone suggest other then a software program  a 'methodology' for the assessment of the thermal performance of existing commercial buildings?

Determining the occupants thermal comfort levels and the air indoor quality would be beneficial but not essential for the methodology.

Thanks in advance.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Central Ground Source Heat Pump
Message-ID: <238133.38824.qm@web111814.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hello,

I am trying to simulate a ground source heat pump system where the ground loop 
is attached to a central?water source four pipe heat pump system. The heat pump 
provides both chilled and hot water simultaneously?to the air handling units in 
the building as required.
?
The chiller type loop to loop heat pump?serves my purpose well. However the 
condenser loop of this system can only be connected to a lake/Well. I need to 
connect this system to a closed?ground loop which I am unable to do so.
?
The chiller type Heat Pump allows connection to the ground loop. But, 
unfortunately this is only a two pipe system and does not allow simultaneous 
heating and cooling.
?
Could any one one please advice me on how to model this.
?

There was a presentation at the SimBuild 2010 in NYC for an office building
that was otherwise the same, identifying changes in energy usage due to the
shape of the floor plan and quantity of window area.

Have you seen the Energy Star Technical Methodologies?



http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=evaluate_performance.bus_portfoliomanager_model_tech_desc



It shows the regressions they ran on the CBECS database to determine the
Energy Star predicted Source EUI.



This delves into similar issues ? for example, in the Office Tech

Building Area and Source EUI.

Dear all,

Building size (or floor area)  should have some influences on energy use
intensity (Btu per sq ft). Roughly speaking, heating energy use intensity
may decrease if the building size increases due to less surface area exposed
to the outside. However, cooling and lighting energy intensity (usually
electricity) may increase for the same reason.  This sounds the case from a
report below except for small buildings (less than 5000 sq ft),
?A Look at Commercial Buildings in 1995: Characteristics, Energy
Consumption, and Energy Expenditures?

Anyone know there are some reports or research about detailed analysis about
influenences of floorspace on energy use intensity?

Thanks,

Jim

Thanks Jeff for the great references for this 'overview' information. I thought you (or someone) might also be able to point to some overview reading regarding schematic energy analysis tools and M&V as a service.

I'm assuming that the mid-sized firm where I work is not unique regarding our challenge to learn more about actual building performance (signed the 2030 carbon challenge). We consult with engineers and in house focus primarily on architecture and landscape. So we use tools like Vasari, Revit, and Green Building Studio to approximate EUI at a massing level, then hand off the energy analysis to the pros (our engineers tend to use HAP or Trace). Our goal with these tools is to understand the relative energy performance of different massing and fenestration designs. While they are nice and simple for us architects, they don't seem to produce detailed reports that we can share with our engineers to accomplish a sense of confidence in the model. However, we are also concerned that learning more sophisticated software (IES, Ecotect, EnergyPlus, eQuest) might not actually improve our design. My question is if there is a relatively recent summary of energy analysis tools available and how they relate to schematic design? Bigger picture, what really needs to occur in the AEC industry to execute competent energy design?

The second question is similar, but regarding M&V. We have seen how third-party commissioning can have a huge impact on performance. We have also started to collect utility information from some of our clients with the intent to better understand actual performance. While we specify numerous meters to track energy consumption, we have not actually had a client follow through with M&V at the level of IPMVP (due to the cost of this service). So we are struggling to gain experience with calibrated energy models and what they can tell us about our initial design assumptions. Is M&V a service that really helps someone operating a 30,000 sf building, or is it more a way to close the loop on design in the hope of doing better next time? Is there a summary of the rationale for M&V, and best practices for delivering this service?

I appreciate that these are pretty broad questions - any reading suggestions are greatly appreciated.

Richard,



The most current publication that covers all aspects of how to rate a building's performance would be the ASHRAE Performance Metric Protocols or PMP. The PMP has three levels of evaluating the energy, water, IEQ (thermal comfort and IAQ), acoustics and lighting performance. In the PMP special emphasis was given to references for both North American and European Standards where the reader could go to learn more.



Unfortunately, assessing the thermal performance of a real building is a bit more difficult because of the compounding errors that occur when one tries to unravel the performance of the various heat transfer pathways, (i.e., the windows, walls, roof, occupants, infiltration, internal loads, etc. Furthermore, to make matters worse, the smaller  the building (i.e., residential), the worse it is to decompose the thermal components, i.e., the window SHGC from the U-value, or the infiltration.



There have been some worthy attempts that have shown certain things can be coaxed out of the data. The earliest one that I'm aware of was the PSTAR by Kris Subbarao in the early 80s. This was later picked up by folks at SERI, now NREL and carried into newer analysis, for example, the recent work with BESTEST EX by Judkoff and Neymark for residential. There was also the mid 90s work by Manke and Hittle that demonstrated the use of empirical parameters, sometimes that were physically unreasonable but gave the best fit. There was also a bit of work done by Palmiter on black and gray box methods, and the "test-hut" work published by Yaeger in the late 1980s. Other works include Mazzucchi, and Kaplan, and of course the work by Hsieh et al. at Princeton. You can pick up the thread on these by reading the literature searches in one or more of the thesis on our web site by Bronson, Bou Saada, Abbas, Song, Kim and others on calibrated simulation.



Hope this helps.

Arpan,



I think you're wasting your money on the IR camera. One drop and its gone...also, although it takes fun photos, you money may be better spent buying portable T/RH data loggers, light meters, acoustics meters, air flow sensors, IR temperature sensors, etc. Then, you'll need specific experiments for them to use (LBNL has quite a bit on this for educators, as does the USDOE, NREL, ORNL). Les Norford and a few others also have some nice on-line experiments they use for students like his "Elf House".



I use about 1 doz Hobos in my classroom for them to take home and record their indoor T/RH for a week, then plot on the psych chart along with outdoor T/RH and comment, after using the Climate consultant software in class. This really gets the point across about psychrometrics.



Also, try getting your hands on an old Vital Signs kit. This contained a list of instruments, experiments, etc. You'll also need software to decompose the T/RH onto the psych chart, etc. I think the price tag was about $5 to $10k for all the instruments in the kit...a really neat toolbox.

If you want to take a look at another course in which architecture students design, build and test smal scale buildings take a look at the open group inside facebook called: arc331 2011

http://www.facebook.com/home.php#!/home.php?sk=group_145994008788777

Students had to design and evaluate an emergency shelter in california. Scroll down to the videos of their work and their boards to get a sense of the project.

A bit on the assignement:

You will design and build a very small pod with a volume of approximately 100 cubic ft (for example 4*4*6.25ft) that can be used as an emergency shelter. In this pod you will be temporarily protected from outdoor conditions in disaster situations in which no services are available. Thus, the main objective is that it must provide thermal comfort without any energy use. The pod should be designed and tested for Pomona (Climate Zone 9) so that it can operate autonomously in this climate without any heating and cooling. Because materials might also be scarce you can use any material that you desire in its construction, preferable those that help to provide a very small carbon footprint (low embodied energy, recycled or recyclable). You can use operable systems (manual or electrical if you use renewable energy). Water and waste don?t have to ?but can- be considered in this project.

There are four environmental variables that determine our level of physical thermal comfort: air temperature, mean radiant temperature, relative humidity and air velocity. To determine comfort you are going to measure air temperature and relative humidity. This means that you will make the following assumptions: mean radiant temperature is equal to air temperature, air velocity is below 0.5 m/s, clothing level is 1 Clo and metabolic rate is 1 met. 

To determine thermal performance of the capsule you must use your thermometer / hygrometer and you must measure temperature and relative humidity inside and outside your comfort cell for a period of at least 18 hours, between 6 AM and 12 Midnight. Your objective is to achieve more hours in comfort inside your cell than outdoors and have 80% of the measured hours in comfort during the 18 hour period. You should explain why comfort was or was not achieved during this period. This explanation is as important as the results achieved.

To increase the understanding of the relationship between environmental controls and structural systems, this project will be developed together with your structures course. Before construction you must submit appropriate drawings for approval to your structures instructor.

A recent question about Phase Change materials....

If you are interested in Phase Change in building components the simulation tool
ESP-r has in-built methods for representing PCM with different performance 
characteristics (and if you do not like the in-built methods you can add a
new method).  

The ESRU group in Glasgow have past and present PhD working on this topic 
who might be able to help.  Note that manufacturers do not always publish the 
full set of properties of PCM that are required for simulation but you might be lucky.

project.

There are four environmental variables that determine our level of physical 
thermal comfort: air temperature, mean radiant temperature, relative 
humidity and air velocity. To determine comfort you are going to measure air 
temperature and relative humidity. This means that you will make the 
following assumptions: mean radiant temperature is equal to air temperature, 
air velocity is below 0.5 m/s, clothing level is 1 Clo and metabolic rate is 
1 met.

To determine thermal performance of the capsule you must use your 
thermometer / hygrometer and you must measure temperature and relative 
humidity inside and outside your comfort cell for a period of at least 18 
hours, between 6 AM and 12 Midnight. Your objective is to achieve more hours 
in comfort inside your cell than outdoors and have 80% of the measured hours 
in comfort during the 18 hour period. You should explain why comfort was or 
was not achieved during this period. This explanation is as important as the 
results achieved.

To increase the understanding of the relationship between environmental 
controls and structural systems, this project will be developed together 
with your structures course. Before construction you must submit appropriate 
drawings for approval to your structures instructor.

Arpan,



I think you're wasting your money on the IR camera. One drop and its 
gone...also, although it takes fun photos, you money may be better spent 
buying portable T/RH data loggers, light meters, acoustics meters, air flow 
sensors, IR temperature sensors, etc. Then, you'll need specific experiments 
for them to use (LBNL has quite a bit on this for educators, as does the 
USDOE, NREL, ORNL). Les Norford and a few others also have some nice on-line 
experiments they use for students like his "Elf House".



I use about 1 doz Hobos in my classroom for them to take home and record 
their indoor T/RH for a week, then plot on the psych chart along with 
outdoor T/RH and comment, after using the Climate consultant software in 
class. This really gets the point across about psychrometrics.



Also, try getting your hands on an old Vital Signs kit. This contained a 
list of instruments, experiments, etc. You'll also need software to 
decompose the T/RH onto the psych chart, etc. I think the price tag was 
about $5 to $10k for all the instruments in the kit...a really neat toolbox.

 and Operation"
Message-ID: <CD91BC49A883474EAC61C23BC0F0071B015DA85EF3D2@EXCHANGE10.campus.tue.nl>

Dear all,

This is just to make you aware of the recently published book "Building Performance Simulation for Design and Operation"  (Spon Press, London, 2011).

The book begins with an introduction to the concepts of performance indicators and targets, followed by a discussion on the role of building simulation in performance-based building design and operation. This sets the ground for in-depth discussion of performance prediction for energy demand, indoor environmental quality (including thermal, visual, indoor air quality and moisture phenomena), HVAC and renewable system performance, urban level modeling, building operational optimization and automation, and future outlook.

Produced in cooperation with IBPSA, and featuring contributions from 21 co-authors, this 536 pages book provides a unique and comprehensive overview of building performance simulation for the complete building life-cycle from conception to demolition. It is primarily intended for advanced students in building services engineering, and in architectural, environmental or mechanical engineering; and will be useful for building and systems designers and operators.

The table of contents is as follows:

Then you'd have a nifty plot along with all the things that Climate consultant does.

Hi,

The building i am modeling has steel frame floor which separates the
conditioned space from unconditioned basement. There are hot water tubes
running underneath between the steel joists for radiant heating. There is no
use of insulation except for v thin aluminium foil below radiant tubes which
is fixed to the steel joists using magnets. This foil helps with high
reflectivity and low thermal absorption prevents heat transfer to the
unconditioned basement.

Can somebody give me ideas how to model this ? I am using eQUEST

Thanks,

Based on all of the feedback we received at the ASHRAE Energy Modeling conference last week...in sum ?Weather files need to be accurate and local but also inexpensive and simple to get and use?, we dramatically reduced our prices for weather files (both 30 yr TMY and single, actual years) to $75 each.  Plus we are adding a very simple interface to go get them at the location you need. Hope this helps and thank you all.

Hi,

I doubt you are able to simulate it by using eQuest. However, it is possible
to simulate it in IES VE (I guess TAS and Energy+ can do the same thing).
Radiant floor can be simulated by 1. top concrete (e.g. 2" of concrete); 2.
radiant piping zone; 3. floor assembly below the radiant piping. For your
case, reflectivity, emiissivity (probably conductivity) should be modified
accordingly between layer 2 and 3.

Cheney

Message-ID: <7be1ab.46a8.12f4d5fcc93.Coremail.foolishstar@163.com>

All my dear,
 
To simulate the district cooling project, if I choose to use the option 2, according to the "treatment of district or campus thermal energy in LEED V2 and LEED 2009-Design&Construction", the baseline building shall follow the minimum efficiency requirement of 6.8.1. My question is, which kind of the chiller I shall choose to use.
The proposed building will buy cold water from an adjacent energy center, which comprises several centrifugal units and screw units. The energy center also use the cold thermal storage system to save the operation fee.
So in the baseline building, which system shall I choose? Shall I refer to the actual energy center when deciding the baseline building AC source? If not, the air cooled is the best choice for its relative low efficiency requirement. Shall the thermal storage be reflected in the baseline building?
If I would like to use the default efficiencies for the proposed building (cooling plant COP4.4), can I also add a thermal storage system in it?
Thanks!
 
Regards,
Han Xing

Message-ID: <931103.26540.qm@web24005.mail.ird.yahoo.com>

Thanks a lot for the information. 

The method used in Energy Star is very interesting. Source energy  may be the 
most equiable arrpoach to provide a fair comparison if buildings use different 
secondary energy sources. However, it may provide more clear relationship 
between heaing or cooling site energ use intensity and independent variables 
(HDD, CDD, floor area, etc.) if the regression is implemented for the buidlings 
of using the same primary and secondary energy form.

Dear all,

Building size (or floor area)  should have some influences on energy use 
intensity (Btu per sq ft). Roughly speaking, heating energy use intensity may 
decrease if the building size increases due to less surface area exposed to the 
outside. However, cooling and lighting energy intensity (usually electricity) 
may increase for the same reason.  This sounds the case from a report below 
except for small buildings (less than 5000 sq ft),
?A Look at Commercial Buildings in 1995: Characteristics, Energy Consumption, 
and Energy Expenditures? 


Anyone know there are some reports or research about detailed analysis about 
influenences of floorspace on energy use intensity?

Thanks,

Jim

Thanks Cheney,

This project uses Heat pumps for cooling and radiant floors for heating. So
to model this i have used Heat pumps ( with just cooling) as my primary
system and attached baseboards to them to simulate radiant floors.

Do u think this would work?

A radiant floor performs vastly different to hydronic baseboards and that
workaround is not a valid approach in my opinion. Having an understanding of
the physics involved in the performance of radiant slabs and their influence
on space heating is essential before any modeling takes palce.

Hi Shubha

I agree with Chris that you could not simply use baseboard to represent
radiant heating floor, especially when you will have to further modify the
physical properties of the material (your high reflectivity and low
absorptivity foil) below hot water tubes. Modeling radiant floor in IES VE
is way more complicated than some general workaround such as using 4 pipe
fan coil without fan power. However it does trace the complicacy of the
physical performance of radiant slab. I guess the hypothesis of such
simulation is that the radiant floor with the foil can effectively 'move'
more heat to the above space? The interaction between the foil and the
radiant slab will be seamless and they can't be modelled separately in your
case. Any workaround or simplification should respect the interaction and
physical performance of radiant slab.

CMU has many professionals who know Energy Plus and other simulation
tools very well. Probably you may seek their help in the area of radiant
slab first. Good luck!

Regards,

Cheney

Message-ID: <13aef548.6652.12f577a7e70.Coremail.foolishstar@163.com>

Dear all,
 
In LEED certification energy consumption modelling, the baseline building AC system is VAV+reheat. There is a fan for each VAV system. I wonder how shall I determine the input data for the fan pressure rise. (There is no autosize.)
You know, in different projects with different single floor area, the VAV fan pressure rise differ a lot. So, shall I do a hydraulic calculation to decide?( It will be very time-consuming) Or is there any recommended value for it in 90.1 or other standards?
Thanks!

Raj,

You can simulate a ground loop as a lake/well loop by applying a temperature schedule to the lake/well loop.  Your annual schedule will have 12 weekly schedules set for each month of the year.  Then each weekly schedule will have a daily schedule.  Each daily schedule will have all 24 hours at the same temperature. I typically make weekly (monthly) schedules that follow the anticipated loop temperatures (heating design temp in March and cooling design temp in September and average ground temperature in shoulder months).  Your geothermal sizing software can give you this temperature profile for your particular situation. If you don't do this, then the program assumes you have water available at the average ground temperature all year from the lake/well loop.

The bigger issue is that the loop-to-loop heat pump library part load curves are not correct and WAY overestimate cooling/heating savings.  For example, using the same size/efficiency water-source chiller will use ~5 times more cooling energy than a loop-to-loop heat pump, mostly independent, of the condenser temperatures.  Try it out and let me know if you see the same thing in your model as it probably depends on how much simultaneous heat/cool you have.  You need to develop your own equipment part load curves/curves that are a stronger function of condenser temperature and not rely on the ones provided with eQUEST for loop-to-loop heat pumps connected to a geothermal field.

Best of luck... -Jon

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Central Ground Source Heat Pump

Hello,
I am trying to simulate a ground source heat pump system where the ground loop is attached to a central water source four pipe heat pump system. The heat pump provides both chilled and hot water simultaneously to the air handling units in the building as required.

The chiller type loop to loop heat pump serves my purpose well. However the condenser loop of this system can only be connected to a lake/Well. I need to connect this system to a closed ground loop which I am unable to do so.

The chiller type Heat Pump allows connection to the ground loop. But, unfortunately this is only a two pipe system and does not allow simultaneous heating and cooling.

Could any one one please advice me on how to model this.

Thank you everyone, Professor Haberl, La Roche and others for all of your
responses!

In addition to the remote sensing equipment, it looks like my friend is
applying for a grant to build *"an interdisciplinary STEM (Science,
Technology, Engineering and Math) LAB"*.

This question may be more for the educators in the group. If you had an
opportunity to build a dream lab, what equipment would you purchase? What
would the exercises look like? Sounds like an exciting project!

Hi All,
           I have two buildings in site plan at some distance and both
are in one facility, and  in system mapping of 90.1 where it mentions
the baseline HVAC system on no of floors and conditioned area, so if
it is no of floors then i have to consider the some of both buildings
means  1st building is 5 floors and second is 3 floors so my baseline
no of floors wil be 8 or i have to map the system separately for the
two buildings and what about conditioned area the system mapping a per
conditioned area also has to be done on basis of some of conditioned
area or for individual ones.

Thanks

Dear All,

Can you please suggest the best modeling tool which has the capabilities to perform Daylight simulation, Thermal comfort analysis in non AC spaces of a building and Energy simulation.

I am using dialux for daylight simulation, Visual Doe for Energy simulation and Transys for Thermal comfort analysis. I am inputting the same details thrice in different softwares. So is there any software which can perform all the 3 analysis in one go.

Regards,
Rathnashree

Rathna,

I've been led to believe that Trnsys users were like the "Jedi knights" 
of building simulation and never thought - if you'll excuse the 
observation - that I'd ever hear one ask such a simple question! Time to 
hang up the light sabre perhaps and resort to something simpler such as 
IES or Designbuilder... ;)

IES is modular and you can share project assumptions and boundaries  
between the ApacheSim module for comfort and energy and tie into IES  
Radiance for daylight. Those results can also feed back into Apache  
for lighting power reductions.

... Or EnergyPlus.

It can evaluate thermal comfort parameters, or output mean radiant
temperatures and space temperatures so that you can do your own
calculations.

You can also get footcandles for daylighting (easily visualized with
openstudio results viewer)

If you are using TRNSYS for your comfort analysis, why not use it for your
energy analysis as well?

Did anyone mention esp-r? Free software, so no limitations and available 
from

http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk/Programs/ESP-r.htm

Still, "best modeling tool" tends to be a rather subjective grading 
scheme. Having an all-in-one solution is nice to reuse information that 
you would need to convert or input several times with specialized 
solutions. The specialized ones usually are more powerful for 
complicated use-cases. E.g. almost all solutions (including above 
mentioned esp-r) somehow integrate an interface to Radiance for 
(day)lighting.

Cheers, Lars.

Message-ID: <1AF72AA22F6D1B4CBA603B402ED47F046F799684D6@AMXEXC02.global.arup.com>

I'm trying to run the Title 24 Savings By Design Compliance Engine for eQuest but am encountering a problem with errors that seem "buggy" to me.
This is the sequence of the run::


1)      I hit the Compliance Analysis Engine button and in the Options window, I select:
Energy Code & Version: Savings by Design - T24, 2008 - v1 (Title24-08.bin)
Compliance Analysis Type: Preliminary
Simulation Output: Minimal Reporting (fastest)
And I check "Store Intermediate Simulation Models".

2)      After evaluating the rule set, a User Prompt pops up that says: "The ruleset processor has posted the following user prompts: --At least on SPACE in the building has DOE 2.2 inputs for automatic daylighting controls.  These will be ignored for Title 24 compliance analysis  Use prescriptive lighting control credits instead. -At least one HVAC system has minimum ventilation properties assigned.  These will be ignored for compliance analysis.  Enter ventilation rates using SPACE and ZONE properties.  -Circulation loop: All user input process loads will be removed for compliance analysis.

Would you like to Continue performing the analysis, or Abort?

3)      I click "Continue"

4)      The program runs through the compliance engine steps and gets to "Step 2".  It runs through "Initializing Ruleset and Examining Inputs", "Generating Proposed Building Description", "Performing Proposed HVAC Sizing Run", Runs the BDL Load File

5)      The Error window appears and reads: "Compliance Analysis Error: Error(s) encountered Performing Proposed HVAC-Sizing Simulation..."

6)      I hit "OK"

7)      And that's it.  No other messages, no more engine running.

8)      When I look in the project folder, eQuest has generated both the T24 Proposed.inp and the SBD Propsed.inp


Bottomline:  Has anyone encountered something similar to this?  If Yes, how did you proceed?



Thanks in advance for any help, suggestions, or comments.

Dear All,

Can you please suggest the best modeling tool which has the  
capabilities to perform Daylight simulation, Thermal comfort analysis  
in non AC spaces of a building and Energy simulation.

I am using dialux for daylight simulation, Visual Doe for Energy  
simulation and Transys for Thermal comfort analysis. I am inputting  
the same details thrice in different softwares. So is there any  
software which can perform all the 3 analysis in one go.

------------------------------------------------------------

Hello Rathmashree,

I suggest you use CODYRUN. Is a french software dedicated to both  
research and consulting firms. You can make the 3 studies (Energy  
simulation, Daylight and thermal confort).that you want at the same  
time. For more information about this software, you can write to   
Professor Harry Boyer (Founder of the software) to this mail : harry.boyer at univ-reunion.fr

Best regards,

PhD / Engineer A. H. Fakra

Wet soil has no insulation value in the winter.  Most studies on 
green roof savings concentrate on cooling savings - this may be true 
for large single storey buildings but for multi-storey buildings, I 
haven't seen any evidence that a green roof will save significant 
energy over a well insulated, light colored roof.

I have made 12 parametric runs in eQUEST-Refrigeration. The program  crashes 
after the 3rd run, although the input doesn't cause a crash when executed  
individually. I have to do 90 such runs so the parametric option (if it  works) 
would be extremely convenient.
Can anybody advise me as to what to do?
Thanks
Jaya

Hamada,

Unfortunately, you've chosen the worst possible building for analysis. There are several reasons for this.

First, there is no single U.S. tool that does an accurate analysis of what you are asking for. There are some that perform simplified analysis of most of the parameters you are looking for, but none do it all right (that I?m aware of). Some of the European codes are getting close, for example ESPr and/or IES/VE, but each has its limitations.

To estimate the thermal analysis with Visual DOE (i.e., DOE-2.1e) or EQUEST (i.e., DOE-2.2) you?d need to have at least one zone that is conditioned in order to simulate conditions in an unconditioned space. So, although it is possible to perform such a simulation, you have to go to great lengths to do this with canned simulations such as DOE-2.1e and DOE-2.2. One successful project that did this for a Buddhist temple was done by Dr. Sreshthaputra, which you can read about in:

Sreshthaputra, A., Haberl, J., Andrews, M. 2004. ?Improving Building Design and Operation .of a Thai Buddhist Temple,? Energy and Buildings, Vol. 36, pp. 481-494.

Or in his thesis:

Atch Sreshthaputra, 2004. ?Building Design and Operation for Improving Thermal Comfort in Naturally Ventilated Buildings in a Hot and Humid Climate,? Department of Architecture, Texas A&M University.

In this work, which was calibrated to real data from the temple, Atch created a fictitious zone that did nothing, then proceeded to model the temple as a unconditioned zone, which worked with one exception that it did not handle the air flows. To get around this Atch ran CFD with a program that used a 3D model from the CHAM engine, then passed the airflows back to DOE-2 each hour to do the run, which calculated the dynamic heat transfer, then back to the CFD for the next hour?s airflow, etc., (taking 24 hours to simulate 24 hours on 2003ish Pentium, not exactly fast).

Second, you can probably get an estimate of the daylighting using DOE-2.1e or DOE-2.2 that should be accurate for and sidelights if you know the internal geometry, including surface characteristics, since they use the split-flux method. More accurate daylighting simulations can be done with RADIANCE or annual simulations with DAYSIM, or perhaps one of the new annual variants of RADIANCE.

Third, true calculations of thermal comfort would require CFD and a internal radiation network (should interior surfaces get hot or cold), which further complicate things.

So, it can be done, but there are only a few efforts in the literature that give solid advice on how to do this, probably more as time goes on. Getting all this in one package is probably not there yet. Probably still a good topic for a Ph.D. thesis.

Dear All,

Can you please suggest the best modeling tool which has the capabilities to perform Daylight simulation, Thermal comfort analysis in non AC spaces of a building and Energy simulation.

I am using dialux for daylight simulation, Visual Doe for Energy simulation and Transys for Thermal comfort analysis. I am inputting the same details thrice in different softwares. So is there any software which can perform all the 3 analysis in one go.

Regards,
Rathnashree


------------------------------------------------------------

Hello Rathmashree,

I suggest you use CODYRUN. Is a french software dedicated to both research and consulting firms. You can make the 3 studies (Energy simulation, Daylight and thermal confort).that you want at the same time. For more information about this software, you can write to  Professor Harry Boyer (Founder of the software) to this mail : harry.boyer at univ-reunion.fr<mailto:harry.boyer at univ-reunion.fr>

Best regards,

PhD / Engineer A. H. Fakra

Thanks Doug,



My oversight. You can certainly put EnergyPlus on the list. This would help some things, yet cause pain for others. It would help for the internal radiation network, better convection models, and might be useful for its nodal air flow analysis.



However, I believe the daylighting model in DOE-2 is a stronger model, but not as strong as DAYSIM. Second, the Winklemann-Huang ground coupling in DOE-2 is still hard to beat, which would be important for an unconditioned building. Finally, if it took 24 hours to ping-pong CFD and DOE-2, it would take much longer to ping-pong EnergyPlus with CFD (perhaps Wangda's graphics processsor would help this).



Perhaps I should have said, in the U.S. one could start with a legacy DOE-2 code and modify it as a warm up. Either way, there still remains no single code in the U.S. that does it all with the most accurate algorithms, including DOE-2,
TRNSYS or EnergyPlus and/or their derivatives. I can't speak for ESPr or IES/VE, but I suspect they have their warts as well.

Hi,
as Python (not PYTHON) user, one is accustomed using sniplets from the web. Regarding the modeling of solar fed hot water systems I would like to cody myself in python. Regarding one-dimensional cubical storage tanks and polymeric absorbers are there some friends publishing their code in python libraries .py?

thanks a lot in advance

Le 25 avr. 11 ? 06:49, Jeff Haberl a ?crit :

Hamada,

Unfortunately, you've chosen the worst possible building for analysis. There are several reasons for this.

First, there is no single U.S. tool that does an accurate analysis of what you are asking for. There are some that perform simplified analysis of most of the parameters you are looking for, but none do it all right (that I?m aware of). Some of the European codes are getting close, for example ESPr and/or IES/VE, but each has its limitations.

To estimate the thermal analysis with Visual DOE (i.e., DOE-2.1e) or EQUEST (i.e., DOE-2.2) you?d need to have at least one zone that is conditioned in order to simulate conditions in an unconditioned space. So, although it is possible to perform such a simulation, you have to go to great lengths to do this with canned simulations such as DOE-2.1e and DOE-2.2. One successful project that did this for a Buddhist temple was done by Dr. Sreshthaputra, which you can read about in:

Sreshthaputra, A., Haberl, J., Andrews, M. 2004. ?Improving Building Design and Operation .of a Thai Buddhist Temple,? Energy and Buildings, Vol. 36, pp. 481-494.

Or in his thesis:

Atch Sreshthaputra, 2004. ?Building Design and Operation for Improving Thermal Comfort in Naturally Ventilated Buildings in a Hot and Humid Climate,? Department of Architecture, Texas A&M University.

In this work, which was calibrated to real data from the temple, Atch created a fictitious zone that did nothing, then proceeded to model the temple as a unconditioned zone, which worked with one exception that it did not handle the air flows. To get around this Atch ran CFD with a program that used a 3D model from the CHAM engine, then passed the airflows back to DOE-2 each hour to do the run, which calculated the dynamic heat transfer, then back to the CFD for the next hour?s airflow, etc., (taking 24 hours to simulate 24 hours on 2003ish Pentium, not exactly fast).

Second, you can probably get an estimate of the daylighting using DOE-2.1e or DOE-2.2 that should be accurate for and sidelights if you know the internal geometry, including surface characteristics, since they use the split-flux method. More accurate daylighting simulations can be done with RADIANCE or annual simulations with DAYSIM, or perhaps one of the new annual variants of RADIANCE.

Third, true calculations of thermal comfort would require CFD and a internal radiation network (should interior surfaces get hot or cold), which further complicate things.

So, it can be done, but there are only a few efforts in the literature that give solid advice on how to do this, probably more as time goes on. Getting all this in one package is probably not there yet. Probably still a good topic for a Ph.D. thesis.

I am using dialux for daylight simulation, Visual Doe for Energy simulation and Transys for Thermal comfort analysis. I am inputting the same details thrice in different softwares. So is there any software which can perform all the 3 analysis in one go.

Hello,

we tried out a software named PARASOL, developed by LTH SWEDEN. but since we wanted to model rollable blinds with PV-included, adding also a special control agorithm, we did our own model in python.
by using PARASOL you may do some postprocessing for the  comfort factors.  also may point you to Mathcad which allows to do all at a macroscopic level with the help of some existing code and WYSIWYG coding.

best regards

To get around this Atch ran CFD with a program that used a 3D model from the CHAM engine, then passed the airflows back to DOE-2 each hour to do the run, which calculated the dynamic heat transfer, then back to the CFD for the next hour?s airflow, etc., (taking 24 hours to simulate 24 hours on 2003ish Pentium, not exactly fast).

  Second, you can probably get an estimate of the daylighting using DOE-2.1e or DOE-2.2 that should be accurate for and sidelights if you know the internal geometry, including surface characteristics, since they use the split-flux method.

 Hi Rathnashree?  

We have developed a tool for this, see .?Please note that it is a
simple?tool mainly appropriate for parametric studies?in the early design
stages. But it is however?pretty accurate for many scenarios.

Hi Gerfried,

Do you mean KTH Sweden? You said LTH! KTH do some work with Equa 
Simulation AB and their system IDA ICE is very promising. The only item 
on the list it doesn't tick is the daylighting - and only then if you 
want output similar to Radiance. However, if you aren't interested in a 
daylight map it does have a fully integrated window shading and daylight 
model that interacts with the thermal simulation at runtime - like E+. 
To my knowledge, I am not aware that IES satisfies window shading models 
that interact with daylight controls at runtime - perhaps Pete Murray 
could comment.

Best regards

Chris

Hello,

no actually LTH:

http://www.ebd.lth.se/english/software/parasol/

If you want to test your own control algorithm you are stuck with most packages...
Regarding daylighting the problem is complexity since there is a huge gap between lumen methods and Raytracing...
Python sniplets for all elements and apparatus would be nice....

cheers

          Hello,
           
          we tried out a software named PARASOL, developed by LTH

            our own model in python.
          by using PARASOL you may do some postprocessing for the

                Dear Prof. Haberl,
                   
                  Is that your remarks are addressed directlty to
                    me ? is what I do understand that you criticize the
                    software CODYRUN ? If this is not the case, I
                    apologize to you for that question.
                   
                  best regards.
                   
                  A. H. Fakra
                  
                     
                    
                      Le 25 avr. 11 ? 06:49, Jeff Haberl a ?crit :
                      
                      
                          
                            
                              Hamada,
                               
                              Unfortunately,
                                  you've chosen the worst possible
                                  building for analysis. There are
                                  several reasons for this.
                               
                              First, there is no
                                  single U.S. tool that does an accurate
                                  analysis of what you are asking for.
                                  There are some that perform simplified
                                  analysis of most of the parameters you
                                  are looking for, but none do it all
                                  right (that I?m aware of). Some of the
                                  European codes are getting close, for
                                  example ESPr and/or IES/VE, but each
                                  has its limitations.
                               
                              To estimate the
                                  thermal analysis with Visual DOE
                                  (i.e., DOE-2.1e) or EQUEST (i.e.,
                                  DOE-2.2) you?d need to have at least
                                  one zone that is conditioned in order
                                  to simulate conditions in an
                                  unconditioned space. So, although it
                                  is possible to perform such a
                                  simulation, you have to go to great
                                  lengths to do this with canned
                                  simulations such as DOE-2.1e and
                                  DOE-2.2. One successful project that
                                  did this for a Buddhist temple was
                                  done by Dr. Sreshthaputra, which you
                                  can read about in:

                              In this work, which
                                  was calibrated to real data from the
                                  temple, Atch created a fictitious zone
                                  that did nothing, then proceeded to
                                  model the temple as a unconditioned
                                  zone, which worked with one exception
                                  that it did not handle the air flows.
                                  To get around this Atch ran CFD with a
                                  program that used a 3D model from the
                                  CHAM engine, then passed the airflows
                                  back to DOE-2 each hour to do the run,
                                  which calculated the dynamic heat
                                  transfer, then back to the CFD for the
                                  next hour?s airflow, etc., (taking 24
                                  hours to simulate 24 hours on 2003ish
                                  Pentium, not exactly fast).
                               
                              Second, you can
                                  probably get an estimate of the
                                  daylighting using DOE-2.1e or DOE-2.2
                                  that should be accurate for and
                                  sidelights if you know the internal
                                  geometry, including surface
                                  characteristics, since they use the
                                  split-flux method. More accurate
                                  daylighting simulations can be done
                                  with RADIANCE or annual simulations
                                  with DAYSIM, or perhaps one of the new
                                  annual variants of RADIANCE.
                               
                              Third, true
                                  calculations of thermal comfort would
                                  require CFD and a internal radiation
                                  network (should interior surfaces get
                                  hot or cold), which further complicate
                                  things.
                               
                              So, it can be done,
                                  but there are only a few efforts in
                                  the literature that give solid advice
                                  on how to do this, probably more as
                                  time goes on. Getting all this in one
                                  package is probably not there yet.
                                  Probably still a good topic for a
                                  Ph.D. thesis.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] ASHRAE 90.2 Modelling for Estidama (Abu Dhabi)
Message-ID: <1AEDEECB91FA7646B3E635ED4CE8A83B09E12945@HLMAILSERVER2.hoarelea.local>

I am carrying out modelling in support of an Estidama (PVRS v1.0)
assessment for a residential development in Abu Dhabi. 

 

Estidama uses the use the Energy cost method in section 8 of ASHRAE
90.2. However, 90.2 requires the use of HVAC efficiencies in accordance
with federal law. There is currently no federal law regarding
efficiencies of HVAC in Abu Dhabi, although there is the Abu Dhabi
International Building code, which I believe is not yet mandatory but
does include minimum efficiencies.

 

My questions are:

 

*	What heating and cooling systems should be used in the baseline
(prescriptive) building?
*	What ventilation system/ fan powers should be used in the
baseline (prescriptive) building? 
*	What should the COPs/ EERs/ efficiencies be for these systems?

 

Thanks,

Claire

You are right, Estidama is still in a stage of infancy. When I work on  
an Estidama project I develop a baseline by identifying the climate to  
an ASHRAE climate zone based on the number of heating and cooling  
degree days. You can then make the case for ASHRAE climate zone 1  
efficiencies as the code compliance standard and governing minimum  
performance.

Does anyone have experience using Retscreen? I was hoping to evaluate it
based on its abilities to assess refrigeration loads. However, I've had
very little luck downloading anything from their website, and before I
attempt installing the software again I'd like some feedback from anyone
who has used it to evaluate refrigeration system ECMs.

 

Thanks

I've only done 90.1 modeling for Estidama PBRS, but I took a look into 90.2
out of interest.


   - What heating and cooling systems should be used in the baseline
   (prescriptive) building?
      - From 90.2-2007 sec. 8.8.4.1., "equipment of the same DOE product
      class shall be used in the proposed design and prescriptive..."
      - Therefore it depends on your proposed system...
      - What ventilation system/ fan powers should be used in the baseline
   (prescriptive) building?
      - 8.8.4.3., the prescriptive design shall have a similar system
      meeting the prescriptive requirements"
      - Also depends on system... I might use same fan powers for both or
      maybe try the 90.1 sec. G3.1.2.9. fan specs?
      - What should the COPs/ EERs/ efficiencies be for these systems?
      - From 90.2-2007 sec. 6.9., the equipment performance shall be "in
      accordance with federal law or as specified in Table 6.9"
      - Therefore if no federal law, use table 6.9

Hopefully someone with more experience can answer the question more directly
or correct me since I haven't submitted any PVRS, and I recommend raising a
CCR to UPC if you still have trouble.

Cheers, and I hope you report your eventual solution!

Hi Claire

We've just done a job in IES-VE 90.1 Ashrae toolkit which took a lot of the set up pain out of the picture for job there, which I imagine you will have access to at HL. As far as I can tell it should be acceptable to use that methodology for Estidama as we've proposed that on a few jobs and have never been told otherwise. I do of course stand to be corrected by all and sundry here.

Kind Regards

Paul

      - From 90.2-2007 sec. 6.9., the equipment performance shall be "in
      accordance with federal law or as specified in Table 6.9"
      - Therefore if no federal law, use table 6.9

Hopefully someone with more experience can answer the question more directly
or correct me since I haven't submitted any PVRS, and I recommend raising a
CCR to UPC if you still have trouble.

Cheers, and I hope you report your eventual solution!

Hello,

I'm told by a good authority that these files were created originally as DOE-2.1e files and then converted to Energyplus. However, the only versions available are EnergyPlus. There might be a possibility that these could be made available if enough people could use them.

It is true that there was a set of DOE2.1E files to start with, but only 3 of the original 15 building models were carried forward to EnergyPlus and they were changed significantly. The other models were created from different sources.  I am not aware of any conversions of the existing files to DOE2.

Since this topic has been brought to my attention from four separate 
sources in the last two months, I've decided to
post a little history about my role in the development of what's now 
called the DOE Commercial Building Benchmarks
(CBB) which may answer some of your questions

When I was still working at LBNL, I had worked for over ten years, 
mostly for the Gas Research Institute but later for
DOE, in developing prototypical buildings first for 60 multi-family 
(1988), 128 single-family (1990), and then 481` commercial buildings 
(1992), all implemented in DOE-2.1E.

In 2004, I was asked by DOE to update the commercial building 
prototypes  (16 building types x 2 vintages x 5 climate zones) to then 
current ASHRAE 90.1 requirements, refine the building geometry or 
architectural layout to "real" buildings (something I wanted to do), 
convert the files from DOE-2 to EnergyPlus (something that DOE wanted me 
to do), and then share them with NREL and PNNL. That project lasted for 
two years (2005-2007), and resulted in the first version of what's now 
called the DOE Commercial Building Benchmarks, which were turned over to 
DOE, NREL, and PNNL in June 2007, just at which time I retired from LBNL 
(no cause and effect implied here, by any means!).

I've heard from others that NREL has continued to work on them, which is 
good because my modeling of the HVAC system and plant in EnergyPlus was 
shaky (more about why this was so later). However, since I've had 
virtually no  communications with NREL about this since my retirement,  
I have no idea of what NREL has done with the (EnergyPlus) files since 
then. I suppose my retirement was a  convenient excuse  for keeping me 
out of the loop,
although any of my friends or acquaintances know well that I'm still 
quite active in the field.

Most of the enquires I get about the CBB, like this current post, ask 
whether there are DOE-2 or eQUEST  versions.
This strikes me as very ironic, since my original work was all in 
DOE-2.1E, and even when I converted them to EnergyPlus, all the 
development work was done in DOE-2 and then converted to EnergyPlus 
using doe2ep, a
DOE-2.1E to EnergyPlus conversion program that I'm also responsible for 
a Californiia Energy Commission project.
In fact, on my deliverables to DOE, NREL, and PNNL, there were always 
two subdirectories - DOE-2 and EnergyPlus,
although  unsurprisingly the DOE-2 files were always ignored.

To tell the truth, I was never comfortable with the CBB released only as 
EnergyPlus files, because I felt that the real value of the CBB lie in 
the building characterizations, which should be independent of the 
simulation program used.  I'm also
not thrilled that the CBB exist as a hundred-some separate EnergyPlus 
IDF files (please correct me if that has changed. That's fine if one 
wants to simply rerun the files, but what would be the point of doing 
that?  In most cases, people want the files as templates  to explore 
various alternatives.

So, what is the current status of  the DOE-2 files that I created for 
the CBB Version 1?  They are publicly available on my  Web site as

(BTW: in the spirit of full disclosure I'm probably  the "good 
authority" to which Jeff referred....

(finishing up on my previous e-mail....)
Since this topic has been brought to my attention from four separate 
sources in the last two months, I've decided to
post a little history about my role in the development of what's now 
called the DOE Commercial Building Benchmarks

IDF files (please correct me if that has changed. That's fine if one 
wants to simply rerun the files, but what would be the point of doing 
that?  In most cases, people want the files as templates  to explore 
various alternatives.

So, what is the current status of  the DOE-2 files that I created for 
the CBB Version 1?  They are publicly available on my  Web site at

 http://www.whiteboxtechnologies.com/Commercial_Prototypes_May7.htm

You'll notice that the file structure is the opposite of individual 
monolithic input files.There is a subdirectory for each building type, 
under which there are modules (actually *.inc include files) for 
construction, schedules, loads, systems, etc.,
that use extensively DOE-2 macros. When you want to do a run, you 
specify the general specifics of the building of interest (building 
type, location, vintage, etc.) in a batch script (example provided) that 
then composes the individual
DOE-2 input file, does a run, and then processes the output using an awk 
script. I've had a Research Associate at the Lab who once ported this 
system to Excel using VB, but I don't want to release that for fear of 
having to debug and
maintain something with which I'm unfamiliar!

A couple of caveats:
1. these files are in DOE-2.1E and date from May 2007, i.e., Version 1 
of the CBB.
2. I've had discussions with several people interested to update them to 
the current version of the CBB, as well as to migrate the files to 
eQUEST/DOE-2.2 . However, given that these have been volunteer efforts, 
there's no telling how much will be achieved (I've not had any 
motivation to seek funding to do this, but I'd be interested to explore 
this if others are interested).

A last note: the reason that the EnergyPlus IDF that I gave 
DOE/NREL/PNNL was weak in the system modeling was that I used doe2ep to 
translate the DOE-2 files to EnergyPlus. However, doe2ep could translate 
only 5 or 6 DOE-2
System Types,  so I made all system types either VAVS, PVAVS, or PSZ.  
Status of doe2ep?  It's also 4 years out of date, which is why I'm 
refraining from releasing it.

So that's the whole story. See, Jeff, now you've got me to finally write 
this down!

Thanks for the replies so far. I am using Tas 9.2.1 software for this
one, but we also have IES available.

 

Our approach at the moment is to use the same system type in the
prescriptive as in the proposed model but using limiting efficiencies
(etc.) in the prescriptive model. Lighting, equipment and occupancy
gains would be the same in each.

 

Not many limiting values are actually given in the 90.2 document - it
generally says to use federal law. Table 6.9 only gives values for GSHP
and split systems, which are considered to be 'non-federally covered'.
The nearest thing we have to federal law is the emerging Abu Dhabi
International Building Code, which is found on the Estidama website.
This has a section entitled 'International Energy Conservation Code'
giving specifications for the Standard Reference and Proposed Designs. 

 

I believe it would be acceptable to use this document for values not
explicitly given in the Estidama or 90.2 documents.

DFDD systems

Came across this article on the efficient use of a dual fan dual duct system
(DFDD).
Is this an isolated case, or do others propose DFDD systems as an EEM on
projects?

Message-ID: <0BA915866A92F542AA5018A148FE0323366990@FGSERVER.fgroup.local>

Hi All,

Our client would like us to produce an eQuest model that

a)      Can be easily adjusted to include current and recently recorded
weather data

b)      Can be easily adjusted to reflect space occupancies and lighting
loads

c)       Will reflect the actual building energy usage to within 1%

Do any of you have experience trying to validate models like this?  

My concern is that models are approximations, and will not account for
small changes in occupancy, outdoor weather, etc.  

I guess my questions are these:

1)      Even if I manage to put in daily occupant and fan schedules
based on actual use, will the model be accurate enough to take me within
1%?

2)      We have been asked to remove plug loads (both for consumption
purposes and cooling loads).  Will this be too big of an assumption to
get any accuracy out of the model in the future?

3)      How do I modify the weather input file?

4)      Are there any other ideas I'm missing that will help us validate
a model as an absolute measure of actual building energy consumption?

Thank you for your help,
Katherine

Katherine,

 

The questions I would have for you (or your client) are:

*         Is this an existing building, or something in the design
phase?

*         What is the model going to be used for?

*         Is there something magical about the 1% number?

*         1% of what? Annual electrical consumption? Annual gas
consumption? Both? Monthly electric/gas consumption? Monthly/annual
electrical demand?

*         Why remove the plug loads? Even if everything else is modeled
perfectly, plug loads are typically 10% or more of annual electrical
consumption but can be all over the place.

*         "Easily adjusted" by whom? Does your client want you to hand
them a model and let them make all subsequent adjustments?

 

Even if you are an expert energy modeler, and there is monitored energy
data available for the building down to the individual electrical panels
or broken out by end use (lighting, plug loads, individual HVAC units
etc.) you will be hard-pressed to get to within 1% on a month-by-month
basis. Even 5% month-by-month is difficult. Sure, you can tweak to your
heart's content to get a model to match annual electric consumption
within 1% based on prior year's utility bills but to maintain a
calibrated model to that tolerance after that would require a lot of
work.

 

I suggest searching the bldg-sim and equest-users archives for
information about weather files.

 

Oh, one more question - how much money does your client have?

 

Regards,

Bill

Bill summed it up really well, Katherine. Sometimes a client will think a
calibrated model must match the real building by an unrealistically high
number, like 1%. I really can't imagine an instance when that would be
desirable. It certainly would be costly to achieve.

Usually the plan is to use the calibrated model as a tool to examine various

Also, a model that is calibrated to actual building use and weather can help

from actual operating energy use that I was able to determine how the

In one case, I created a model of an existing building.  For this model, I
made an actual count of lighting fixtures and computers.  For most of the

lower electrical use, equivalent to 1/3 of the computers remaining on

Weighing in late on this..

If I get >80% R-squared correlation, I think I'm doing well!  

There are so many unknowns, including the normal situation that the client
doesn't know their own operating schedules, occupancy patterns, or
maintenance / calibration procedures..

Hi All,

Our client would like us to produce an eQuest model that

a)      Can be easily adjusted to include current and recently recorded
weather data

b)      Can be easily adjusted to reflect space occupancies and lighting
loads

c)       Will reflect the actual building energy usage to within 1%

Do any of you have experience trying to validate models like this?  

My concern is that models are approximations, and will not account for small
changes in occupancy, outdoor weather, etc.  

I guess my questions are these:

1)      Even if I manage to put in daily occupant and fan schedules based on
actual use, will the model be accurate enough to take me within 1%?

2)      We have been asked to remove plug loads (both for consumption
purposes and cooling loads).  Will this be too big of an assumption to get
any accuracy out of the model in the future?

3)      How do I modify the weather input file?

4)      Are there any other ideas I'm missing that will help us validate a
model as an absolute measure of actual building energy consumption?

Thank you for your help,

Dear all,

 

Starting from the trnsys manual I am trying to deeper understand the
transfer function coefficients (meaning and formula of the
coefficient,..) and the step of calculation for a wall.

 

Does anyone know literature, references, books that explain methods for
a better understanding of the calculation steps?

 

Thanks for your help,

Hi Stefano,

The TRNSYS building model is based on this work, it might be a good start;

Seem, J. E. (1987), 'Modeling of Heat Transfer in Buildings', PhD thesis,
University of Wisconsin-Madison.

If you can understand it, maybe you can explain it to me after ;)

Cheers from Vienna,

Marcus

Message-ID: <C5E1527F129BF545A250B5AD0B0C26EF08D05971@ENTWEXMB0000000.university.harvard.edu>

Dear colleagues, 

 

Some of you and/or your associates might be interested in a three day
executive education program on 'Daylighting Buildings' that we will
again be offering on July 6-8 2011 at Harvard University, Graduate
School of Design. Course participants will acquire a range of
daylighting design analysis techniques ranging from rules of thumb to
state-of-the-art computer simulations and high dynamic range photography
for glare analysis. The main simulation programs used will be Rhino
combined with our DIVA plug-in <http://www.diva-for-rhino.com/>  that
exports Rhino scenes into Radiance, Daysim, Evalglare and - starting
this summer-  EnergyPlus. Simulation outputs include:

-          Daylight factor and indoor illuminance distributions for LEED
IEQ Credit 8.1 Compliance (Radiance)

-          Annual radiation maps for urban studies

-          Climate-based metrics including daylight autonomy and useful
daylight illuminance (Radiance/Daysim)

-          Physically based scene visualizations (Radiance)

-          Glare analysis under selected sky
conditions(Radiance/Evalglare)

-          Annual glare maps (Daysim/Evalglare)

-          Thermal loads calculations (EnergyPlus and Radiance/Daysim)

 

The physical assumptions underlying these simulation programs and
performance metrics will be discussed in detail. The first two days will
consist of formal instructions, in-class discussions, hands-on software
tutorials, and exercises. Day two will start with a lecture on circadian
effects of light by Professor Stephen Lockley form the Harvard Medical
School. Participants will be given the opportunity to calibrate their
personal digital cameras to take HDR images and learn several ways of
how to quantitatively evaluate these images. During the last day,
participants will be given the opportunity to apply the newly acquired
analysis techniques to ongoing projects of their own and to go over
specific problems or simulation challenges with the instructor.

 

You can sign up for the program at
http://execed.gsd.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/exec_ed/details.cgi?offering_id=10
2042. Please direct any content-related questions to me.
Administrational/logistics questions can be answered by Ms. Margaret
Moore De Chicojay (margaret_moore_dechicojay at harvard.edu).

 

We are looking forward to welcoming some of you to Cambridge this July.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Do I Include Baseboards in the ASHRAE 90.1-1999 Budget
	Building?
Message-ID: <C9E04173.A285%greg@zonengineering.com>

Good morning,

I'm in the process of carrying out a simulation using a budget building based on ASHRAE 90.1-1999. In the proposed building, 75% of the annual heating load is met by single zone, gas-fired, constant volume roof top units (with DX cooling). The remaining 25% of the annual heating load is met using electric baseboard heaters. The budget building uses system types 11 (packaged rooftop air conditioner, CV, DX, fossil fuel furnace). I'm wondering what to do with the electric baseboards in the budget building. Do I keep them in just as they are in the proposed building (I.e. same capacities), or do I delete them altogether and force the rooftop units to meet 100% of the annual heating load? ASHRAE 90.1-1999 appears to be silent on this issue.

Thanks and kindest regards,

Yes you include them.  90.1-1999 11.4.3.k.(2) round about page 59 says if you have two sources use the primary source to determine your system type but the secondary one stays the same between the two models.
Now I have to get back to office bingo.  Happy modeling.

Thanks Paul! I looked up that clause and its very clear that I keep the electric baseboards in. When they say they "shall be modeled identically", I assume they also mean keep the capacities that same, correct?

I know I have less experience calibrating models than some other
respondents, but I'll share my perspectives as well:

 

It is easy to adjust occupancy schedules / lighting loads in eQuest, but
it requires the end-user knows the program.  If the end-user is
inexperienced with eQuest or any other simulation program, then there is
no "easily modifiable" model you can provide.

 

1)      Even if I manage to put in daily occupant and fan schedules
based on actual use, will the model be accurate enough to take me within
1%?

 

With regard to historical modeling, showing any deadband of accuracy to
known costs/consumptions is *technically* possible given enough
information and time...  That said, falling within 1% of any holistic
measure, even on an annual basis, before "refining the unknowns" would
probably happen only by very lucky/happy coincidence.  It's fair to say
that in a relative sense, some buildings operate much more regularly and
predictably than others, and for these cases you or a client might
reasonably expect a tighter deadband.  Asking what is "accurate enough"
is like asking "what's reasonable," and the answer is that it depends on
what info/time you have. There are always "unknowable" variables that
can play a big role in your end-results (example:  what is the actual
leakiness of a 35 year old envelope?).

 

2)      We have been asked to remove plug loads (both for consumption
purposes and cooling loads).  Will this be too big of an assumption to
get any accuracy out of the model in the future?

 

Depends on your building, but for most buildings plug loads are a
significant fraction of consumption/internal loads.  

 

3)      How do I modify the weather input file?

 

I saved the attached email from David Reddy for the next time I need to
tackle "actual weather."  My attempts thus far haven't been terribly
successful, so I have no "go-to" procedures to share just yet.  I have
heard reference from those who appear in the know to macro/VBA-heavy
excel spreadsheets which can automate the workflow to one extent or
another, but I've not yet seen one with my own eyes.  I have yet to hear
of any program that can "easily" incorporate recently recorded weather
data.  

 

4)       Are there any other ideas I'm missing that will help us
validate a model as an absolute measure of actual building energy
consumption?

 

Generally:  the only "absolute measure of actual building consumption"
will be the utility bills.  Something about the 1% number tells me you
or your client might be trying to hammer a nail with a screwdriver...
Energy models are great for looking to the past to make decisions that
acknowledge the unknowns of the future, but if the real goal is to know
the actual energy usage on an hourly basis - why not set up some
sub-meters and track them?  While meters/bills measure energy usage and
energy models can use that information to make predictions, models don't
determine bills - it doesn't work in reverse!

 

PS:  For all the work you might put into calibrating a model with
historical weather and other known data, keep perspective that your
model will only ever be that accurate for behaviour in that year.  The
moment anyone wants  to use this model predictively (for the future),
you probably should swap back to TMY weather data and embrace the
inherent unknowns.

Weighing in late on this....

If I get >80% R-squared correlation, I think I'm doing well!  

There are so many unknowns, including the normal situation that the
client doesn't know their own operating schedules, occupancy patterns,
or maintenance / calibration procedures....

Also, a model that is calibrated to actual building use and weather can
help to highlight building operation issues.  I have had models which
were off from actual operating energy use that I was able to determine
how the building was operating inefficiently.

 

In one case, I created a model of an existing building.  For this model,
I made an actual count of lighting fixtures and computers.  For most of
the year, there were few other electrical loads.  I based on their
occupancy and use schedules, I was not quite able to calibrate the
electrical energy use.  When I met with the client, I informed him that
my model showed somewhat lower electrical use, equivalent to 1/3 of the
computers remaining on 24-hours per day.  As it turned out, about 1/3 of
the employees DID leave their computers on at all times so that they
could log in remotely.

 

... I guess what I'm saying is that maybe the goal is not to get the
model within 1% of the building energy use, but get the building within
1% of the model.

Bill summed it up really well, Katherine. Sometimes a client will think
a calibrated model must match the real building by an unrealistically
high number, like 1%. I really can't imagine an instance when that would
be desirable. It certainly would be costly to achieve. 

 

Usually the plan is to use the calibrated model as a tool to examine
various energy saving measures/opportunities that the client may be
interested in implementing. It is important to remember, in this case
that you are looking at the usage between the calibrated model and the
ECM model, so the 1% deviation is consistent in both and not a worry.

	Katherine,

	 

	The questions I would have for you (or your client) are:

	*         Is this an existing building, or something in the
design phase?

	*         What is the model going to be used for?

	*         Is there something magical about the 1% number?

	*         1% of what? Annual electrical consumption? Annual gas
consumption? Both? Monthly electric/gas consumption? Monthly/annual
electrical demand?

	*         Why remove the plug loads? Even if everything else is
modeled perfectly, plug loads are typically 10% or more of annual
electrical consumption but can be all over the place.

	*         "Easily adjusted" by whom? Does your client want you
to hand them a model and let them make all subsequent adjustments?

	 

	Even if you are an expert energy modeler, and there is monitored
energy data available for the building down to the individual electrical
panels or broken out by end use (lighting, plug loads, individual HVAC
units etc.) you will be hard-pressed to get to within 1% on a
month-by-month basis. Even 5% month-by-month is difficult. Sure, you can
tweak to your heart's content to get a model to match annual electric
consumption within 1% based on prior year's utility bills but to
maintain a calibrated model to that tolerance after that would require a
lot of work.

	 

	I suggest searching the bldg-sim and equest-users archives for
information about weather files.

	 

	Oh, one more question - how much money does your client have?

	Our client would like us to produce an eQuest model that

	a)      Can be easily adjusted to include current and recently

	b)      Can be easily adjusted to reflect space occupancies and
lighting loads

	c)       Will reflect the actual building energy usage to within

5% is a really tight number we have been forced to work with on come retro
commissioning projects in the past, with 10% being the norm on an annual and
monthly basis for overall building energy use.  Anything stricter than those
numbers is unrealistic (again for the overall building).

Depends on your building, but for most buildings plug loads are a
significant fraction of consumption/internal loads.  

 

3)      How do I modify the weather input file?

 

I saved the attached email from David Reddy for the next time I need to
tackle "actual weather."  My attempts thus far haven't been terribly
successful, so I have no "go-to" procedures to share just yet.  I have heard
reference from those who appear in the know to macro/VBA-heavy excel
spreadsheets which can automate the workflow to one extent or another, but
I've not yet seen one with my own eyes.  I have yet to hear of any program
that can "easily" incorporate recently recorded weather data.  

 

4)       Are there any other ideas I'm missing that will help us validate a
model as an absolute measure of actual building energy consumption?

 

Generally:  the only "absolute measure of actual building consumption" will
be the utility bills.  Something about the 1% number tells me you or your
client might be trying to hammer a nail with a screwdriver. Energy models
are great for looking to the past to make decisions that acknowledge the
unknowns of the future, but if the real goal is to know the actual energy
usage on an hourly basis - why not set up some sub-meters and track them?
While meters/bills measure energy usage and energy models can use that
information to make predictions, models don't determine bills - it doesn't
work in reverse!

 

PS:  For all the work you might put into calibrating a model with historical
weather and other known data, keep perspective that your model will only
ever be that accurate for behaviour in that year.  The moment anyone wants
to use this model predictively (for the future), you probably should swap
back to TMY weather data and embrace the inherent unknowns.

Weighing in late on this..

If I get >80% R-squared correlation, I think I'm doing well!  

There are so many unknowns, including the normal situation that the client
doesn't know their own operating schedules, occupancy patterns, or
maintenance / calibration procedures..

Also, a model that is calibrated to actual building use and weather can help
to highlight building operation issues.  I have had models which were off
from actual operating energy use that I was able to determine how the
building was operating inefficiently.

 

In one case, I created a model of an existing building.  For this model, I
made an actual count of lighting fixtures and computers.  For most of the
year, there were few other electrical loads.  I based on their occupancy and
use schedules, I was not quite able to calibrate the electrical energy use.
When I met with the client, I informed him that my model showed somewhat
lower electrical use, equivalent to 1/3 of the computers remaining on
24-hours per day.  As it turned out, about 1/3 of the employees DID leave
their computers on at all times so that they could log in remotely.

 

... I guess what I'm saying is that maybe the goal is not to get the model
within 1% of the building energy use, but get the building within 1% of the
model.

Bill summed it up really well, Katherine. Sometimes a client will think a
calibrated model must match the real building by an unrealistically high
number, like 1%. I really can't imagine an instance when that would be
desirable. It certainly would be costly to achieve. 

 

Usually the plan is to use the calibrated model as a tool to examine various
energy saving measures/opportunities that the client may be interested in
implementing. It is important to remember, in this case that you are looking
at the usage between the calibrated model and the ECM model, so the 1%
deviation is consistent in both and not a worry.

Katherine,

 

The questions I would have for you (or your client) are:

*         Is this an existing building, or something in the design phase?

*         What is the model going to be used for?

*         Is there something magical about the 1% number?

*         1% of what? Annual electrical consumption? Annual gas consumption?
Both? Monthly electric/gas consumption? Monthly/annual electrical demand?

*         Why remove the plug loads? Even if everything else is modeled
perfectly, plug loads are typically 10% or more of annual electrical
consumption but can be all over the place.

*         "Easily adjusted" by whom? Does your client want you to hand them
a model and let them make all subsequent adjustments?

 

Even if you are an expert energy modeler, and there is monitored energy data
available for the building down to the individual electrical panels or
broken out by end use (lighting, plug loads, individual HVAC units etc.) you
will be hard-pressed to get to within 1% on a month-by-month basis. Even 5%
month-by-month is difficult. Sure, you can tweak to your heart's content to
get a model to match annual electric consumption within 1% based on prior
year's utility bills but to maintain a calibrated model to that tolerance
after that would require a lot of work.

 

I suggest searching the bldg-sim and equest-users archives for information
about weather files.

 

Oh, one more question - how much money does your client have?

Bill

Subject: [Bldg-sim] eQuest - Model verification

 

Hi All,

Our client would like us to produce an eQuest model that

a)      Can be easily adjusted to include current and recently recorded
weather data

b)      Can be easily adjusted to reflect space occupancies and lighting
loads

c)       Will reflect the actual building energy usage to within 1%

Do any of you have experience trying to validate models like this?  

My concern is that models are approximations, and will not account for small
changes in occupancy, outdoor weather, etc.  

I guess my questions are these:

1)      Even if I manage to put in daily occupant and fan schedules based on
actual use, will the model be accurate enough to take me within 1%?

2)      We have been asked to remove plug loads (both for consumption
purposes and cooling loads).  Will this be too big of an assumption to get
any accuracy out of the model in the future?

3)      How do I modify the weather input file?

4)      Are there any other ideas I'm missing that will help us validate a

Thank you for your help,

There is a ASHRAE guideline that outlines the metrics for deciding when the
model is calibrated - ASHRAE guideline 14. Also it is alluded to by the RMI
modelling workshop slides. The CVRMSE is around 10%, and the monthly ERR is
15%. I usually look at these numbers for electric and gas separately.
How many people follow the ASHRAE guideline for calibration and are there
any other metrics out there?

I would take 'identical' to mean same type, capacity, schedule, zone depth, and control method.  I do not read 'identical' to mean the absolute same electrical heating consumption values on your ECB form.  If you have thermostatic control of your baseboards, the numbers won't match.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Do I Include Baseboards in the ASHRAE 90.1-1999 Budget Building?

Good morning,

I'm in the process of carrying out a simulation using a budget building based on ASHRAE 90.1-1999. In the proposed building, 75% of the annual heating load is met by single zone, gas-fired, constant volume roof top units (with DX cooling). The remaining 25% of the annual heating load is met using electric baseboard heaters. The budget building uses system types 11 (packaged rooftop air conditioner, CV, DX, fossil fuel furnace). I'm wondering what to do with the electric baseboards in the budget building. Do I keep them in just as they are in the proposed building (I.e. same capacities), or do I delete them altogether and force the rooftop units to meet 100% of the annual heating load? ASHRAE 90.1-1999 appears to be silent on this issue.

Thanks and kindest regards,

5% is a really tight number we have been forced to work with on come retro
commissioning projects in the past, with 10% being the norm on an annual and

numbers is unrealistic (again for the overall building).

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] eQuest - Model verification

 

I know I have less experience calibrating models than some other
respondents, but I'll share my perspectives as well:

 

It is easy to adjust occupancy schedules / lighting loads in eQuest, but it
requires the end-user knows the program.  If the end-user is inexperienced
with eQuest or any other simulation program, then there is no "easily
modifiable" model you can provide.

 

1)      Even if I manage to put in daily occupant and fan schedules based on
actual use, will the model be accurate enough to take me within 1%?

 

With regard to historical modeling, showing any deadband of accuracy to
known costs/consumptions is *technically* possible given enough information
and time.  That said, falling within 1% of any holistic measure, even on an
annual basis, before "refining the unknowns" would probably happen only by
very lucky/happy coincidence.  It's fair to say that in a relative sense,
some buildings operate much more regularly and predictably than others, and
for these cases you or a client might reasonably expect a tighter deadband.
Asking what is "accurate enough" is like asking "what's reasonable," and the
answer is that it depends on what info/time you have. There are always
"unknowable" variables that can play a big role in your end-results
(example:  what is the actual leakiness of a 35 year old envelope?).

 

2)      We have been asked to remove plug loads (both for consumption
purposes and cooling loads).  Will this be too big of an assumption to get
any accuracy out of the model in the future?

 

Depends on your building, but for most buildings plug loads are a
significant fraction of consumption/internal loads.  

 

3)      How do I modify the weather input file?

 

I saved the attached email from David Reddy for the next time I need to
tackle "actual weather."  My attempts thus far haven't been terribly
successful, so I have no "go-to" procedures to share just yet.  I have heard
reference from those who appear in the know to macro/VBA-heavy excel
spreadsheets which can automate the workflow to one extent or another, but
I've not yet seen one with my own eyes.  I have yet to hear of any program
that can "easily" incorporate recently recorded weather data.  

 

4)       Are there any other ideas I'm missing that will help us validate a
model as an absolute measure of actual building energy consumption?

 

Generally:  the only "absolute measure of actual building consumption" will
be the utility bills.  Something about the 1% number tells me you or your
client might be trying to hammer a nail with a screwdriver. Energy models
are great for looking to the past to make decisions that acknowledge the
unknowns of the future, but if the real goal is to know the actual energy
usage on an hourly basis - why not set up some sub-meters and track them?
While meters/bills measure energy usage and energy models can use that
information to make predictions, models don't determine bills - it doesn't

back to TMY weather data and embrace the inherent unknowns.

Weighing in late on this..

If I get >80% R-squared correlation, I think I'm doing well!  

There are so many unknowns, including the normal situation that the client
doesn't know their own operating schedules, occupancy patterns, or
maintenance / calibration procedures..

Also, a model that is calibrated to actual building use and weather can help
to highlight building operation issues.  I have had models which were off
from actual operating energy use that I was able to determine how the
building was operating inefficiently.

 

In one case, I created a model of an existing building.  For this model, I
made an actual count of lighting fixtures and computers.  For most of the
year, there were few other electrical loads.  I based on their occupancy and
use schedules, I was not quite able to calibrate the electrical energy use.
When I met with the client, I informed him that my model showed somewhat
lower electrical use, equivalent to 1/3 of the computers remaining on
24-hours per day.  As it turned out, about 1/3 of the employees DID leave
their computers on at all times so that they could log in remotely.

 

... I guess what I'm saying is that maybe the goal is not to get the model
within 1% of the building energy use, but get the building within 1% of the
model.

Bill summed it up really well, Katherine. Sometimes a client will think a
calibrated model must match the real building by an unrealistically high
number, like 1%. I really can't imagine an instance when that would be
desirable. It certainly would be costly to achieve. 

 

Usually the plan is to use the calibrated model as a tool to examine various
energy saving measures/opportunities that the client may be interested in
implementing. It is important to remember, in this case that you are looking
at the usage between the calibrated model and the ECM model, so the 1%
deviation is consistent in both and not a worry.

Katherine,

 

The questions I would have for you (or your client) are:

.         Is this an existing building, or something in the design phase?

.         What is the model going to be used for?

.         Is there something magical about the 1% number?

.         1% of what? Annual electrical consumption? Annual gas consumption?
Both? Monthly electric/gas consumption? Monthly/annual electrical demand?

.         Why remove the plug loads? Even if everything else is modeled
perfectly, plug loads are typically 10% or more of annual electrical
consumption but can be all over the place.

.         "Easily adjusted" by whom? Does your client want you to hand them
a model and let them make all subsequent adjustments?

 

Even if you are an expert energy modeler, and there is monitored energy data
available for the building down to the individual electrical panels or
broken out by end use (lighting, plug loads, individual HVAC units etc.) you
will be hard-pressed to get to within 1% on a month-by-month basis. Even 5%
month-by-month is difficult. Sure, you can tweak to your heart's content to
get a model to match annual electric consumption within 1% based on prior
year's utility bills but to maintain a calibrated model to that tolerance
after that would require a lot of work.

 

I suggest searching the bldg-sim and equest-users archives for information
about weather files.

 

Oh, one more question - how much money does your client have?

Bill

Hi All,

Our client would like us to produce an eQuest model that

a)      Can be easily adjusted to include current and recently recorded
weather data

b)      Can be easily adjusted to reflect space occupancies and lighting
loads

c)       Will reflect the actual building energy usage to within 1%

Do any of you have experience trying to validate models like this?  

My concern is that models are approximations, and will not account for small
changes in occupancy, outdoor weather, etc.  

I guess my questions are these:

1)      Even if I manage to put in daily occupant and fan schedules based on
actual use, will the model be accurate enough to take me within 1%?

2)      We have been asked to remove plug loads (both for consumption
purposes and cooling loads).  Will this be too big of an assumption to get
any accuracy out of the model in the future?

3)      How do I modify the weather input file?

4)      Are there any other ideas I'm missing that will help us validate a
model as an absolute measure of actual building energy consumption?

Thank you for your help,

Rohini,

 

We require that models are calibrated following ASHRAE Guideline 14 for
projects that participate in several major (hundreds of buildings in the
pipeline) modeling-based incentive programs in North East. To support this
requirement, we developed a spreadsheet-based tool to verify achieved
calibration (via pass/fail flag). Statistical calculations and tolerances in
the tool are largely based on Guideline 14, which we had to tweak in few
places to better adapt it to real life scenarios that we ran into (e.g.
stored fuels with no clean monthly usage data, etc.). The process also uses
ETRACKER software, a free weather normalization tool from University of
Dayton http://academic.udayton.edu/kissock/http/Weather/default.htm. The
above mentioned incentive programs rely on network of approved providers
that are required to use the tool to document incentives. If you'd like to
get the tool, feel free to email me off the list (the file is rather large).


 

Thanks,  

 

Maria

There is a ASHRAE guideline that outlines the metrics for deciding when the
model is calibrated - ASHRAE guideline 14. Also it is alluded to by the RMI
modelling workshop slides. The CVRMSE is around 10%, and the monthly ERR is
15%. I usually look at these numbers for electric and gas separately.

How many people follow the ASHRAE guideline for calibration and are there
any other metrics out there?

Message-ID: <BANLkTi=fJdZKYtNvAJiBYHKyAKzWk8B1Ug@mail.gmail.com>

System 6 in ASHRAE 90.1 1999 is a Water-Source Heat Pump system with
constant volume fan control, DX cooling and Electric Heat Pump and Boiler
for heating.

My question is what is happening on the source side of the water-source heat
pump and how do the heat pump and boiler interact? Is the boiler for backup
only or is it providing hot water to the heat pumps continuously. This
system doesn't seem to make sense. If it were air-source then it would.

Any thoughts?

Dear friends in the larger Boston area (which of course includes NYC),

 

As previously announced by Holly and Diego, the IBPSA Boston Chapter is
organizing a series of 'research meets practice' type lectures during
which we want to discuss common problems related to building energy
modeling, the first one  being on setting occupancy and plug-load
schedules during design. While we have two speakers from the research
world, we would love to also hear how practice deals with the issue.
Please consider joining a 'civilized and friendly' discussion as a
speaker/panelist.

Maria, Rohini, and anyone else in the know,
You brought up an interesting point with ASHRAE 14. It suggests MBE and CVRMSE 
numbers, which seem pretty difficult to achieve. Are many practitioners hitting 
these numbers in the field??If so, what is the end purpose of these calibrated 
models? It seems like the IPMVP 2006 (referenced by the LEED M&V credit) 
*suggests* using ASHRAE 14; however, their own case studies do not seem to hit 
these ASHRAE targets, which makes me curious.

For those of you?using models for commissioning what level of calibration seems 
appropriate, being realistic about effort and model usefulness?? Is anyone in 
practice using calibrated models for on-going commissioning/fault detection?

Thank you for any information!!!

As to James posting on this issue the weather data platform we are just finishing has cleaned up and localized weather input and can deliver a continuously updated stream of recent history and current conditions with direct web services access to any and all data.  In other words, we have the weather data side of the client?s desire all set.  We are very happy to cooperate with any efforts to integrate, assimilate or utilize this in a model or models.  Indeed we are looking for partners here, as we believe this is going to be an increasingly important element in the solution to upgrading existing buildings.  So if anyone wants to take on this part of the problem for Katherine, we will supply the weather data portion for free.

5% is a really tight number we have been forced to work with on come retro commissioning projects in the past, with 10% being the norm on an annual and monthly basis for overall building energy use.  Anything stricter than those numbers is unrealistic (again for the overall building).

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] eQuest - Model verification

 

I know I have less experience calibrating models than some other respondents, but I?ll share my perspectives as well:

 

It is easy to adjust occupancy schedules / lighting loads in eQuest, but it requires the end-user knows the program.  If the end-user is inexperienced with eQuest or any other simulation program, then there is no ?easily modifiable? model you can provide.

 

1)      Even if I manage to put in daily occupant and fan schedules based on actual use, will the model be accurate enough to take me within 1%?

 

With regard to historical modeling, showing any deadband of accuracy to known costs/consumptions is *technically* possible given enough information and time?  That said, falling within 1% of any holistic measure, even on an annual basis, before ?refining the unknowns? would probably happen only by very lucky/happy coincidence.  It?s fair to say that in a relative sense, some buildings operate much more regularly and predictably than others, and for these cases you or a client might reasonably expect a tighter deadband.  Asking what is ?accurate enough? is like asking ?what?s reasonable,? and the answer is that it depends on what info/time you have. There are always ?unknowable? variables that can play a big role in your end-results (example:  what is the actual leakiness of a 35 year old envelope?).

 

2)      We have been asked to remove plug loads (both for consumption purposes and cooling loads).  Will this be too big of an assumption to get any accuracy out of the model in the future?

 

Depends on your building, but for most buildings plug loads are a significant fraction of consumption/internal loads.  

 

3)      How do I modify the weather input file?

 

I saved the attached email from David Reddy for the next time I need to tackle ?actual weather.?  My attempts thus far haven?t been terribly successful, so I have no ?go-to? procedures to share just yet.  I have heard reference from those who appear in the know to macro/VBA-heavy excel spreadsheets which can automate the workflow to one extent or another, but I?ve not yet seen one with my own eyes.  I have yet to hear of any program that can ?easily? incorporate recently recorded weather data.  

 

4)      Are there any other ideas I?m missing that will help us validate a model as an absolute measure of actual building energy consumption?

 

Generally:  the only ?absolute measure of actual building consumption? will be the utility bills.  Something about the 1% number tells me you or your client might be trying to hammer a nail with a screwdriver? Energy models are great for looking to the past to make decisions that acknowledge the unknowns of the future, but if the real goal is to know the actual energy usage on an hourly basis ? why not set up some sub-meters and track them?  While meters/bills measure energy usage and energy models can use that information to make predictions, models don?t determine bills ? it doesn?t work in reverse!

 

PS:  For all the work you might put into calibrating a model with historical weather and other known data, keep perspective that your model will only ever be that accurate for behaviour in that year.  The moment anyone wants  to use this model predictively (for the future), you probably should swap back to TMY weather data and embrace the inherent unknowns.

Also, a model that is calibrated to actual building use and weather can help to highlight building operation issues.  I have had models which were off from actual operating energy use that I was able to determine how the building was operating inefficiently.

 

In one case, I created a model of an existing building.  For this model, I made an actual count of lighting fixtures and computers.  For most of the year, there were few other electrical loads.  I based on their occupancy and use schedules, I was not quite able to calibrate the electrical energy use.  When I met with the client, I informed him that my model showed somewhat lower electrical use, equivalent to 1/3 of the computers remaining on 24-hours per day.  As it turned out, about 1/3 of the employees DID leave their computers on at all times so that they could log in remotely.

 

... I guess what I'm saying is that maybe the goal is not to get the model within 1% of the building energy use, but get the building within 1% of the model.

Bill summed it up really well, Katherine. Sometimes a client will think a calibrated model must match the real building by an unrealistically high number, like 1%. I really can't imagine an instance when that would be desirable. It certainly would be costly to achieve. 

 

Usually the plan is to use the calibrated model as a tool to examine various energy saving measures/opportunities that the client may be interested in implementing. It is important to remember, in this case that you are looking at the usage between the calibrated model and the ECM model, so the 1% deviation is consistent in both and not a worry.

  Katherine,

   

  The questions I would have for you (or your client) are:

  ?         Is this an existing building, or something in the design phase?

  ?         What is the model going to be used for?

  ?         Is there something magical about the 1% number?

  ?         1% of what? Annual electrical consumption? Annual gas consumption? Both? Monthly electric/gas consumption? Monthly/annual electrical demand?

  ?         Why remove the plug loads? Even if everything else is modeled perfectly, plug loads are typically 10% or more of annual electrical consumption but can be all over the place.

  ?         ?Easily adjusted? by whom? Does your client want you to hand them a model and let them make all subsequent adjustments?

   

  Even if you are an expert energy modeler, and there is monitored energy data available for the building down to the individual electrical panels or broken out by end use (lighting, plug loads, individual HVAC units etc.) you will be hard-pressed to get to within 1% on a month-by-month basis. Even 5% month-by-month is difficult. Sure, you can tweak to your heart?s content to get a model to match annual electric consumption within 1% based on prior year?s utility bills but to maintain a calibrated model to that tolerance after that would require a lot of work.

   

  I suggest searching the bldg-sim and equest-users archives for information about weather files.

   

  Oh, one more question ? how much money does your client have?

   

  Regards,

  Bill

  Hi All,

  Our client would like us to produce an eQuest model that

  a)      Can be easily adjusted to include current and recently recorded weather data

  b)      Can be easily adjusted to reflect space occupancies and lighting loads

  c)       Will reflect the actual building energy usage to within 1%

  Do any of you have experience trying to validate models like this?  

  My concern is that models are approximations, and will not account for small changes in occupancy, outdoor weather, etc.  

  I guess my questions are these:

  1)      Even if I manage to put in daily occupant and fan schedules based on actual use, will the model be accurate enough to take me within 1%?

  2)      We have been asked to remove plug loads (both for consumption purposes and cooling loads).  Will this be too big of an assumption to get any accuracy out of the model in the future?

  3)      How do I modify the weather input file?

  4)      Are there any other ideas I?m missing that will help us validate a model as an absolute measure of actual building energy consumption?

  Thank you for your help,
  Katherine
