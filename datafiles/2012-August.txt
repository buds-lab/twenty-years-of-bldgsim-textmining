Subject: [Bldg-sim] Soffit Leakage
Message-ID: <F8EC2129FFF9654EBB55C6DDE79B70751F2CC9F09A@exchange01.hosted.golden-tech.com>

Hello colleagues

I have a an air leakage question,
The problem is when the exterior soffit vents and fascia panels are open to interior ceiling spaces, can be to a plenum ceiling or non-plenum ceiling,
these openings at the soffit and fascia are allowing air infiltration above ceiling tile,

Does anybody know what method/formula to use to calculate these air infiltration energy losses, and how they load the HVAC units ?
Any reference/articles ?

Thank you

P.S I don?t use any software, I would like to do it in excel

See http://bepan.info/proj-bldgs/p-14-tall-bldg-press for leakage (infiltration) calculations in Excel. The CONTAM library gives leakage data. The energy estimate was with degree days. The soffit can also be analyzed in Excel with design conditions and with degree days.  Since it is a small model, you could try CONTAM.  See http://www.bfrl.nist.gov/IAQanalysis/software/index.htm

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Unexpected heating results and envelope sensitivity.
Message-ID: <5BA294AFBDCA9E4696F3F14ED7DA5C2502ADC3A6@catormsx02>

Hi all - we're encountering unexpected heating results and envelope sensitivity in our model of a typical Core & Shell office building in Montreal, Canada (ASHRAE Climate Zone 6A).

The building is modeled as fan powered underfloor air distribution from compartmental units fed by makeup air units on the roof. The heating plant has a modulating boiler, HRV, and the envelope has 53% WWR. We're using EE4 (DOE2.1E) vs the MNECB code. The proposed building has a worse envelope than the auto-generated baseline case.

Out two questions:


1.       We think our heating savings are lower than expected (only 10% savings) while are cooling/fans/pumps savings are as expected (60%-80% savings) vs the MNECB baseline case.

2.       We don't understand why reducing the envelope performance has a greater than expected impact on our overall savings (15% worse). Given our experience with similar eQuest models in similar climate zones, we would expect similar envelope performance reduction to have only an overall performance impact of around 3%.


To give a reasonable code comparison, LEED NC 2009 give EAc1 points for between 12% and 48% savings vs ASHRAE 90.1-2007 and 25% to 56% savings vs the MNECB.

I would appreciate your insight as to why the model may be performing as such. I can provide more information if it would help.

Thanks kindly,

Dear all,

in our case CHP-power is fed into the public grid because there is a good feed-in-tariff for it. Now we we would like to know how we should treat this under the headline of "Treatment of District or Campus Thermal Energy" for LEED certification.

Should we respect, that the electrical power is not consumed in the building or follow Appendix D of the document, page 25 "Proposed case: allocate the electricity generation to the building based on the fraction of thermal loads to the building for the DES sources that use recovered waste heat"


We would very much appreciate any comment on that!



Kind regards

Johannes

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Fast computer graphics techniques for calculating direct
	solar radiation on complex building surfaces - a paper from
	the official IBPSA Journal,
	the Journal of Building Performance Simulation
Message-ID: <4B0F9EF30FB8654F88EC762FF52FDA620AB57B26@UKEXBE02.UK.CorpLAN.net>

Direct solar radiation has a major influence on a building's thermal
behaviour. Current simulation engines are not up to the challenge of
accurately modelling solar gains for buildings with complex or curved
geometry and buildings sited in dense urban areas. Accurate thermal
performance prediction for buildings in early stages of design is
hindered by excessive computation time and incompatibility between
architectural models and building energy simulation software. This paper
proposes using a combination of modern computer graphics rendering
techniques and parametric B-spline interpolation methods to quickly and
accurately calculate solar gains over a full year based on sparse data
with a continuous interpolation method. These new procedures accommodate
complex building geometries and intricate shadow patterns and can
accelerate shading calculations by several orders of magnitude. Faster
calculations allow studies to be made at the early stages of design when
modifications can have the greatest impact on a building's thermal
behaviour.

Message-ID: <CALKTE9T-UTpsMzg+stEF_O56e_NizD5LDrQyRZ5WMfQc7G6TvA@mail.gmail.com>

Good day to all..

Working on modeling an existing building per 90.1 for LEED certification
and can not find clear answers in the standard or users guide- and seeking
of the advise of the Bidg-Sim community-
The building is basically a shell- the 6 inch tilt up concrete walls and
concrete floor are the only things remaining un-changed. The building is
installing new HVAC systems, a new roof, a new lighting systems, new
skylights, new doors, new windows and insulating the existing walls. The
space is 35,000 square feet, and beside another building. The building
owners bought out their former neighbor and are expanding into their space,
the space shares a wall with their current space.


   1. Adiabatic wall- Should it be Modeled with an adiabatic wall
   separating the "two" buildings (that are actually one building with a
   separating wall and separate address), or should the "other building" not
   seeking LEED certification be included in the model?
   2. Rotated average baseline- This is an existing building and
   orientation is set, so is this procedure still necessary or required by
   90.1/LEED
   3. Baseline Constructions- Should the baseline reflect the walls as they
   where before renovation (Un insulated tilt up concrete walls/R-5 roof
   deck?) or should it use the ASHRAE light weight constructions with 2007
   insulation for the climate, or should it use the actual constructions but
   add ASHRAE 2007 insulation?
   4. The HVAC system is a CAV, with convective natural gas heating and and
   DX cooling- roof top units, the baseline system for this should be system #
   5 PVAV- or should the baseline HVAC system be what ever system was in the
   building before the renovation?


An advanced thank you goes out to all that respond-

I also had this question sometime before, but didn't tried to download as
it was not urgent.

It seems that the distribution of Radiance installer is changed now (with
the new version), its not as straight forward as before. The how-to-install
text file in the new installer folder has explained the procedure. I
haven't read it, but you can explore. Also it would be great if you can
summarize your findings about this installation. Thanks!

Hi everyone,

 

We are modeling a VRF system with EE4.  Is there any workaround (4-pipe fan
coils or WLHP) that needs to be used in order to properly model these type
of systems.  I know that there is a power point presentation or a paper
about it for eQUEST.  If anyone have a copy, it would be much appreciated.

Arpan - This is nice to hear.  I also reached out to the site volunteering for guinea pig status.  I am assuming this is highly anticipated and should offer exceptional interface capacity.

Hi everyone,

 

We are modeling a VRF system with EE4.  Is there any workaround (4-pipe fan
coils or WLHP) that needs to be used in order to properly model these type
of systems.  I know that there is a power point presentation or a paper
about it for eQUEST.  If anyone have a copy, it would be much appreciated.

That is a very interesting paper.  The use of B-Splines is 
particularly of interest as I worked on a program for designing ships 
hulls with my old friend Rolf Oetter at the University of Victoria.

We used B-Splines and knots in a similar fashion.  That was ages ago 
and program is widely in use:

Part of the sustainable building practice is the life cycle costs of 
systems and materials used in the project.

I am looking for a source to help determine the environmental impact 
of importing things like natural beach stones and other materials 
that are gathered, washed sorted and shipped from other continents to 
North America.  So items that are not processed like cement, steel, 
etc.  Sort of like the embodied energy but the embodied environmental 
impact.  From disturbing a beach and the surrounding waters, to the 
fuel used for gathering, packing, shipping and transporting to the 
final destination.

This particular project is installing a large, natural beach stone 
mosaic at the main entrance to the building.  The stones are 
uniformly light and dark - a "black and white" motif.  The reference 
material is beach stones that could be gathered from beaches within 3 
miles - hand picked and transported by bicycle, wheel barrow,etc.

The material selected is shipped from Indonesia to Toronto.

Chris,
You might shoot an email over to the international living futures
institute-  here is my contact- jay.kosa at living-future.org
They have been working on standardisation of this type of environmental
impact lifecycle analysis.

Chris,
You might shoot an email over to the international living futures institute-  here is my contact- jay.kosa at living-future.org<mailto:jay.kosa at living-future.org>
They have been working on standardisation of this type of environmental impact lifecycle analysis.

Part of the sustainable building practice is the life cycle costs of systems and materials used in the project.

I am looking for a source to help determine the environmental impact of importing things like natural beach stones and other materials that are gathered, washed sorted and shipped from other continents to North America.  So items that are not processed like cement, steel, etc.  Sort of like the embodied energy but the embodied environmental impact.  From disturbing a beach and the surrounding waters, to the fuel used for gathering, packing, shipping and transporting to the final destination.

This particular project is installing a large, natural beach stone mosaic at the main entrance to the building.  The stones are uniformly light and dark - a "black and white" motif.  The reference material is beach stones that could be gathered from beaches within 3 miles - hand picked and transported by bicycle, wheel barrow,etc.

The material selected is shipped from Indonesia to Toronto.

1.      Not sure about this one. although I feel like I read a CIR about it
once.

2.      Rotating is not required for an existing building (although I did
rotate a building we put an addition on)

3.      Baseline walls are the existing walls.

4.      Baseline HVAC is per the table, not the existing HVAC system.

Good day to all..

 

Working on modeling an existing building per 90.1 for LEED certification and
can not find clear answers in the standard or users guide- and seeking of
the advise of the Bidg-Sim community- 

The building is basically a shell- the 6 inch tilt up concrete walls and
concrete floor are the only things remaining un-changed. The building is
installing new HVAC systems, a new roof, a new lighting systems, new
skylights, new doors, new windows and insulating the existing walls. The
space is 35,000 square feet, and beside another building. The building
owners bought out their former neighbor and are expanding into their space,
the space shares a wall with their current space. 

 

1.	Adiabatic wall- Should it be Modeled with an adiabatic wall
separating the "two" buildings (that are actually one building with a
separating wall and separate address), or should the "other building" not
seeking LEED certification be included in the model?
2.	Rotated average baseline- This is an existing building and
orientation is set, so is this procedure still necessary or required by
90.1/LEED
3.	Baseline Constructions- Should the baseline reflect the walls as
they where before renovation (Un insulated tilt up concrete walls/R-5 roof
deck?) or should it use the ASHRAE light weight constructions with 2007
insulation for the climate, or should it use the actual constructions but
add ASHRAE 2007 insulation?
4.	The HVAC system is a CAV, with convective natural gas heating and
and DX cooling- roof top units, the baseline system for this should be
system # 5 PVAV- or should the baseline HVAC system be what ever system was
in the building before the renovation?

 

An advanced thank you goes out to all that respond-

Anne,
Thanks- I will check with the Credit interpretation request database for
adiabatic walls, and thanks for the confirmation of my assumptions of the
other questions.

Hi,
I am working on a lifecycle cost study on advanced glazing. I am looking for a typical warm edge / premium spacer to use as a reference / baseline in the study. Does anyone have a suggestion, and any info such as a drawing (dxf etc) or THERM file that they could share?
Thanks,

I've specified super-spacer on windows before. Have to point out they
were dual glazed units for  a boat and I needed organic shapes so I
wasn't concerned about the warm edge benefit.

Not sure if the effective thermal conductivity is the right number for
eQuest but it is available on their technical info page.

Hi,

I am working on a lifecycle cost study on advanced glazing. I am looking for a typical warm edge / premium spacer to use as a reference / baseline in the study. Does anyone have a suggestion, and any info such as a drawing (dxf etc) or THERM file that they could share?

The Frameplus Online tool is great for analyzing different 
glazings.  You have the option of different spacers, argon or air 
fill, different thermal breaks in the aluminum curtainwall or window 
framing.  It offers curtain wall, fixed window, and 
casement/awning.  The report gives centre of glass U, overall Uvalue, 
etc.  The bottom of the report provides the equest performance values.

If you have already modeled in eQUEST you might try zeroing out all of the
HVAC components (compressors, fans, etc.) and perform an hourly report of
the indoor DB & WB.  Once you know what hours are compliant with ASHRAE 55
comfort window you can subtract those hours of energy related to HVAC from
the original design model.  

 

I am assuming you are doing this for LEED purposes

 

Other possibilities are to utilized Natural Ventilation Software in order to
do the same analysis.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] CO2 controller on energyplus - Zone Contaminant Balance
Message-ID: <track.BA50310012DB4@smtp-04.smtp.mandic.prv>

I am simulating (EnergyPlus 6) a 200+ zone building with 116 conditioned zones, with CO2 controlled external air using the IAQP procedure with the needed objects and an external 400 CO2ppm and internal limits from 400 to 1000, apparently it does model the mechanical ventilation but, when I look on the variables output I get CO2 concentrations as low as 90, frequently around 200.

How can I get contaminant concentrations lower than than of the outside air (without an internal CO2 sink) in these occupied conditioned zones? Is there any known issues or recommendations for this air contaminant balance procedure?

Thanks a lot for the attention,

i have been looking into it recently as well.  the full software 
(certified by acca) is $500 & there are only 4 authorized resellers. if 
your local authority lets you use the abridged version there is a free 
spreadsheet on the acca website but you still need the manual (about 
$90) for the constructions & associated values to enter.

Rasheed,

What we do is model the zones in eQuest as a PVVT system, and then use the air change method for the natural ventilation.

To determine the proper air change rate, we use an IES model of the space(s), and input those results into eQuest.

It's not perfect, but it has passed LEED review.

Ideally you would build the whole model in IES or an e+ variant, but that brings along other challenges.

Good luck.

the software programs but can only perform the Manual J calculations, the D

In California, we can use either Manual J or ASHRAE methods for loads.  
EnergyPro uses the ASHRAE methods, so that is OK to use.  I would ask 
how EQuest does loads, and if it's ASHRAE, I'd use that if you are 
familiar with it.  We are also allowed to use Manual D or ASHRAE methods 
for ducts and the ASHRAE methods are in the ASHRAE handbook.  For simple 
residential, it's a simple duct losses spreadsheet that you can make up 
yourself.

The University of Liechtenstein seeks candidates to fill the following vacancies at the Institute of Architecture and Planning with immediate effect:

Doctoral students
In the field of sustainable design

The Chair for Sustainable Design researches aspects related to buildings' energy technology. The interdisciplinary research team is positioned at the interface between architecture and technology. We are looking for two staff members for research projects on transparent, liquid-filled transparent facade elements and on the use of phase-change materials (PCM) in translucent building envelopes. Our research relies heavily on numerical simulations. Therefore, we are looking for candidates with knowledge in the areas of building simulation and heat transfer, who graduated with distinction from a Master's degree programme (MSc) in Architecture, Physics, Mechanical Engineering or a related discipline. Ideally, candidates should have already gained relevant methodical skills and be determined to expand their knowledge at a high academic level. Motivation, independence, flexibility and the ability to work in a team will prove indispensable qualities for the successful undertaking of the related tasks. Excellent German and/or English language skills are mandatory.
Successful applicants will be integrated in the doctoral degree programme in Architecture and Planning of the University of Liechtenstein's Graduate School.
The University of Liechtenstein offers an attractive environment in both the professional and private sphere. In addition to working in one of Europe's most agreeable regions, candidates will be presented with challenging projects in a motivating atmosphere boasting attractive research conditions.

The University of Liechtenstein aims to increase the number of women in research and academia. Therefore, we expressly encourage qualified women to apply.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Comparison of Text Editors for idf-file
Message-ID: <CAOEZ-cKqYjDW1ycUBYTATUcAtmTk5KRiALRjp9xS0-VzuOz6xw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

It might be useful for some of us who gets annoyed with notepad.

I did a quick comparison of three text editors: TextPad 6.1.3, Notepad++
6.1.5 and relatively new Sublime 2.1.

I have selected several features, some of which I found very useful, others
somehow useful.

*E.g. very useful:   *

   - Syntax highlighting,
   - Side by side file compare (someone may know this feature from Total
   Commander),
   - Text fold/unfold(collapse/uncollapse)


*Somehow useful: *

   - Save Copy As ... ,
   - Rectangular selection (used to be in the stone age qedit)


A picture in the attachment shows the results of this comparison.

In brief, NONE of these editors can claim having MORE THAN ONE useful
feature!

Your comments and personal experience are very welcome.


Thanks,

Pavel Dybskiy
Ryerson University,Toronto

I haven't ventured into Energyplus IDF file editing but for DOE2.1e 
and DOE2.2, UltraEdit works great.

UltraEdit includes:
Syntax highlighting for programming languages not build included is 
very easy to add - edit a text file.
Side by side file compare, file merge etc.
Text fold/unfold
Save Copy As
Rectangular selection and column summing - this is handy when 
examining the results files.

In addition UltraEdit has a fairly decent macro programming feature 
including Record Keystrokes which is very handy for extracting 
sections from the results files and copying them into another file.

One nice feature of UltraEdit is the ability to define Projects - a 
group of files that are to be opened together.

Also, you can run dos commands/programs - handy for command line 
compiling.  I use it for running DOE2 when debugging an input 
file.  You can also call Windows programs but I haven't had a need to 
do that as yet.

I have been using UltraEdit since 1996 - it replaced the dos based 
editor I had been using, "Brief", a Borland product.  I still use the 
Brief keystroke commands - UltraEdit allows you to redefine the 
keystroke commands.

Could I ask how to set the UltraEdit? it seems very slow to open a text
file compared to notepad++ and sublime.

Thanks,.

That's surprising - I've used UltraEdit for many years and don't see any 
slowness.  As far as I know I'm using mostly default settings. The only 
time it seems slow is with large files (on the order of 50MB and up).  
There is a setting to control this in Advanced --> Configuration -->File 
Handling -->Temporary Files.

By the way, EnergyPlus v7.1 syntax highlighting files are available for 
TextPad and UltraEdit (scroll to the bottom of the page).

http://energyplus.helpserve.com/Knowledgebase/List/Index/47

In UltraEdit, the settings for this are found in Advanced--> 
Configuration --> Editor Display--> Syntax Highlighting

I've been using UltraEdit since Jason (thanks Jason!) posted the following
syntax highlighting keyword list for DOE-2. (Dug out of the bldg-sim archive
from June 1999.)

 

 

 

BLD-SIMers,

 

I use a text editor to edit most of my DOE-2 input files (I 

know, its primitive but it works). One of the features that 

my text editor has is syntax coloring.  Over the last few 

years I have made a list of DOE-2 keywords so that the 

editor would show them as a different color.  The editor 

also has a way to show comment lines and numbers using 

different colors. The editor I used is called UltraEdit and 

below is the list and syntax needed.  

 

UltraEdit is shareware and runs on Windows 95 and NT.

 

   http://www.ultraedit.com

 

For UltraEdit, just add the text below to the WORDFILE.TXT 

file.  This may be useful to other text editors that do 

syntax coloring but the syntax will need to be modified.  

The list is far from complete, I add to it whenever I come 

across a keyword that isn't colored.  Anyone is welcome to 

use this but you should let me know so if it changes I can 

send you an update.  Also if you do use it and find missing 

keywords please send me an updated version.  

 

Jason

(remember to ignore my signature and the list signature on 

the bottom of the message)

 

============================================

Add the following to UltraEdits WORDFILE.TXT

============================================

 

/L5"DOE-2" Line Comment = $ File Extensions = INP //Nocase

/Delimiters = ~!@$%^&*()_+=|\{}[]:;"'<> ,?

That's surprising - I've used UltraEdit for many years and don't see any
slowness.  As far as I know I'm using mostly default settings.  The only
time it seems slow is with large files (on the order of 50MB and up).  There
is a setting to control this in Advanced --> Configuration -->File Handling
-->Temporary Files.

By the way, EnergyPlus v7.1 syntax highlighting files are available for
TextPad and UltraEdit (scroll to the bottom of the page).

http://energyplus.helpserve.com/Knowledgebase/List/Index/47

In UltraEdit, the settings for this are found in Advanced--> Configuration
--> Editor Display--> Syntax Highlighting

I haven't ventured into Energyplus IDF file editing but for DOE2.1e and
DOE2.2, UltraEdit works great.  

UltraEdit includes:
Syntax highlighting for programming languages not build included is very
easy to add - edit a text file.  
Side by side file compare, file merge etc.
Text fold/unfold
Save Copy As
Rectangular selection and column summing - this is handy when examining the
results files.

In addition UltraEdit has a fairly decent macro programming feature
including Record Keystrokes which is very handy for extracting sections from
the results files and copying them into another file.

One nice feature of UltraEdit is the ability to define Projects - a group of
files that are to be opened together.  

Also, you can run dos commands/programs - handy for command line compiling.
I use it for running DOE2 when debugging an input file.  You can also call
Windows programs but I haven't had a need to do that as yet.  

I have been using UltraEdit since 1996 - it replaced the dos based editor I
had been using, "Brief", a Borland product.  I still use the Brief keystroke
commands - UltraEdit allows you to redefine the keystroke commands.

Hi all,

It might be useful for some of us who gets annoyed with notepad.

I did a quick comparison of three text editors: TextPad 6.1.3, Notepad++
6.1.5 and relatively new Sublime 2.1.

I have selected several features, some of which I found very useful, others
somehow useful.

E.g. very useful:   

*	Syntax highlighting, 
*	Side by side file compare (someone may know this feature from Total
Commander),  
*	Text fold/unfold(collapse/uncollapse) 


Somehow useful: 

*	Save Copy As ... ,  
*	Rectangular selection (used to be in the stone age qedit) 


A picture in the attachment shows the results of this comparison.

In brief, NONE of these editors can claim having MORE THAN ONE useful
feature!   

Your comments and personal experience are very welcome.


Thanks,

I spend a fair amount of time comparing files.  For that I have an extremely
useful and inexpensive program called ExamDiff.  It's honestly light years
ahead of Textpad and UltraEdit.

I've been using UltraEdit since Jason (thanks Jason!) posted the following
syntax highlighting keyword list for DOE-2. (Dug out of the bldg-sim archive
from June 1999.)

 

 

 

BLD-SIMers,

 

I use a text editor to edit most of my DOE-2 input files (I 

know, its primitive but it works). One of the features that 

my text editor has is syntax coloring.  Over the last few 

years I have made a list of DOE-2 keywords so that the 

editor would show them as a different color.  The editor 

also has a way to show comment lines and numbers using 

different colors. The editor I used is called UltraEdit and 

below is the list and syntax needed.  

 

UltraEdit is shareware and runs on Windows 95 and NT.

 

   http://www.ultraedit.com

 

For UltraEdit, just add the text below to the WORDFILE.TXT 

file.  This may be useful to other text editors that do 

syntax coloring but the syntax will need to be modified.  

The list is far from complete, I add to it whenever I come 

across a keyword that isn't colored.  Anyone is welcome to 

use this but you should let me know so if it changes I can 

send you an update.  Also if you do use it and find missing 

keywords please send me an updated version.  

 

Jason

That's surprising - I've used UltraEdit for many years and don't see any
slowness.  As far as I know I'm using mostly default settings.  The only
time it seems slow is with large files (on the order of 50MB and up).  There
is a setting to control this in Advanced --> Configuration -->File Handling
-->Temporary Files.

By the way, EnergyPlus v7.1 syntax highlighting files are available for
TextPad and UltraEdit (scroll to the bottom of the page).

http://energyplus.helpserve.com/Knowledgebase/List/Index/47

In UltraEdit, the settings for this are found in Advanced--> Configuration
--> Editor Display--> Syntax Highlighting

In addition UltraEdit has a fairly decent macro programming feature

the results files and copying them into another file.

One nice feature of UltraEdit is the ability to define Projects - a group of
files that are to be opened together.  

Also, you can run dos commands/programs - handy for command line compiling.
I use it for running DOE2 when debugging an input file.  You can also call
Windows programs but I haven't had a need to do that as yet.  

I have been using UltraEdit since 1996 - it replaced the dos based editor I
had been using, "Brief", a Borland product.  I still use the Brief keystroke
commands - UltraEdit allows you to redefine the keystroke commands.

Hi all,

I did a quick comparison of three text editors: TextPad 6.1.3, Notepad++
6.1.5 and relatively new Sublime 2.1.

I have selected several features, some of which I found very useful, others
somehow useful.

E.g. very useful:   

*	Syntax highlighting, 
*	Side by side file compare (someone may know this feature from Total
Commander),  
*	Text fold/unfold(collapse/uncollapse) 


Somehow useful: 

*	Save Copy As ... ,  
*	Rectangular selection (used to be in the stone age qedit) 


A picture in the attachment shows the results of this comparison.

In brief, NONE of these editors can claim having MORE THAN ONE useful
feature!   

Your comments and personal experience are very welcome.

I have not used ExamDiff or UltraEdit, will try to check it out.
I use WinMerge (its free) and great for comparing files.

I spend a fair amount of time comparing files.  For that I have an extremely useful and inexpensive program called ExamDiff.  It's honestly light years ahead of Textpad and UltraEdit.

I've been using UltraEdit since Jason (thanks Jason!) posted the following syntax highlighting keyword list for DOE-2. (Dug out of the bldg-sim archive from June 1999.)



BLD-SIMers,

I use a text editor to edit most of my DOE-2 input files (I
know, its primitive but it works). One of the features that
my text editor has is syntax coloring.  Over the last few
years I have made a list of DOE-2 keywords so that the
editor would show them as a different color.  The editor
also has a way to show comment lines and numbers using
different colors. The editor I used is called UltraEdit and
below is the list and syntax needed.

UltraEdit is shareware and runs on Windows 95 and NT.

   http://www.ultraedit.com

For UltraEdit, just add the text below to the WORDFILE.TXT
file.  This may be useful to other text editors that do
syntax coloring but the syntax will need to be modified.
The list is far from complete, I add to it whenever I come
across a keyword that isn't colored.  Anyone is welcome to
use this but you should let me know so if it changes I can
send you an update.  Also if you do use it and find missing
keywords please send me an updated version.

Jason
(remember to ignore my signature and the list signature on
the bottom of the message)

I use vim <http://www.vim.org/>extensively. It has a good diff facility 
and I can find/ replace based on regular expressions 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression>. You can also execute 
commands (e.g. "find /text string/ and replace the Nth following line 
with /this string/") .

Vim & emacs are probably the most powerful, extensible text editors but 
have quite a leaning curve.

If you hack through text files a lot I recommend that you learn one of them.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Text Editor for idf-file
Message-ID: <track.B91C11000E37B@smtp-04.smtp.mandic.prv>

About the text editor issue, I use and recommend VIM (http://www.vim.org) for editing idf and viewing output files, it?s an open source editor that has a version for Windows (graphic interface GVIM) and does all the needed operations, beginning with the syntax highlighting (use FORTRAN mode, that is the idf closest file type) and passing thru lots of text tools like multiple file split comparison, searches, file comparisons and others.

This editor is also light, there is no need to install (no administrator/superuser priviledges needed) and it never freezes, complains or does something you do not expect.

I haven't ventured into Energyplus IDF file editing but for DOE2.1e
and DOE2.2, UltraEdit works great.

UltraEdit includes:
Syntax highlighting for programming languages not build included is
very easy to add - edit a text file.
Side by side file compare, file merge etc.
Text fold/unfold
Save Copy As
Rectangular selection and column summing - this is handy when
examining the results files.

In addition UltraEdit has a fairly decent macro programming feature
including Record Keystrokes which is very handy for extracting
sections from the results files and copying them into another file.

One nice feature of UltraEdit is the ability to define Projects - a
group of files that are to be opened together.

Also, you can run dos commands/programs - handy for command line
compiling.  I use it for running DOE2 when debugging an input
file.  You can also call Windows programs but I haven't had a need to
do that as yet.

I have been using UltraEdit since 1996 - it replaced the dos based
editor I had been using, "Brief", a Borland product.  I still use the
Brief keystroke commands - UltraEdit allows you to redefine the
keystroke commands.

Could I ask how to set the UltraEdit? it seems very slow to open a text
file compared to notepad++ and sublime.

Thanks,.

That's surprising - I've used UltraEdit for many years and don't see any
slowness.  As far as I know I'm using mostly default settings. The only
time it seems slow is with large files (on the order of 50MB and up).
There is a setting to control this in Advanced --> Configuration -->File
Handling -->Temporary Files.

By the way, EnergyPlus v7.1 syntax highlighting files are available for
TextPad and UltraEdit (scroll to the bottom of the page).

I've been using UltraEdit since Jason (thanks Jason!) posted the following
syntax highlighting keyword list for DOE-2. (Dug out of the bldg-sim archive
from June 1999.)







BLD-SIMers,



I use a text editor to edit most of my DOE-2 input files (I

know, its primitive but it works). One of the features that

my text editor has is syntax coloring.  Over the last few

years I have made a list of DOE-2 keywords so that the

editor would show them as a different color.  The editor

also has a way to show comment lines and numbers using

different colors. The editor I used is called UltraEdit and

below is the list and syntax needed.



UltraEdit is shareware and runs on Windows 95 and NT.



   http://www.ultraedit.com



For UltraEdit, just add the text below to the WORDFILE.TXT

file.  This may be useful to other text editors that do

syntax coloring but the syntax will need to be modified.

The list is far from complete, I add to it whenever I come

across a keyword that isn't colored.  Anyone is welcome to

use this but you should let me know so if it changes I can

send you an update.  Also if you do use it and find missing

keywords please send me an updated version.



Jason

(remember to ignore my signature and the list signature on

the bottom of the message)

Add the following to UltraEdits WORDFILE.TXT

UltraEdit includes:
Syntax highlighting for programming languages not build included is very
easy to add - edit a text file.
Side by side file compare, file merge etc.
Text fold/unfold
Save Copy As
Rectangular selection and column summing - this is handy when examining the
results files.

In addition UltraEdit has a fairly decent macro programming feature
including Record Keystrokes which is very handy for extracting sections from
the results files and copying them into another file.

One nice feature of UltraEdit is the ability to define Projects - a group of
files that are to be opened together.

Also, you can run dos commands/programs - handy for command line compiling.
I use it for running DOE2 when debugging an input file.  You can also call
Windows programs but I haven't had a need to do that as yet.

I have been using UltraEdit since 1996 - it replaced the dos based editor I
had been using, "Brief", a Borland product.  I still use the Brief keystroke
commands - UltraEdit allows you to redefine the keystroke commands.

Hi all,

It might be useful for some of us who gets annoyed with notepad.

I did a quick comparison of three text editors: TextPad 6.1.3, Notepad++
6.1.5 and relatively new Sublime 2.1.

I have selected several features, some of which I found very useful, others
somehow useful.

E.g. very useful:

*       Syntax highlighting,
*       Side by side file compare (someone may know this feature from Total
Commander),
*       Text fold/unfold(collapse/uncollapse)


Somehow useful:

*       Save Copy As ... ,
*       Rectangular selection (used to be in the stone age qedit)


A picture in the attachment shows the results of this comparison.

In brief, NONE of these editors can claim having MORE THAN ONE useful
feature!

Your comments and personal experience are very welcome.

I spend a fair amount of time comparing files.  For that I have an extremely
useful and inexpensive program called ExamDiff.  It's honestly light years
ahead of Textpad and UltraEdit.

I've been using UltraEdit since Jason (thanks Jason!) posted the following
syntax highlighting keyword list for DOE-2. (Dug out of the bldg-sim archive
from June 1999.)







BLD-SIMers,



I use a text editor to edit most of my DOE-2 input files (I

know, its primitive but it works). One of the features that

my text editor has is syntax coloring.  Over the last few

years I have made a list of DOE-2 keywords so that the

editor would show them as a different color.  The editor

also has a way to show comment lines and numbers using

different colors. The editor I used is called UltraEdit and

below is the list and syntax needed.



UltraEdit is shareware and runs on Windows 95 and NT.



   http://www.ultraedit.com



For UltraEdit, just add the text below to the WORDFILE.TXT

file.  This may be useful to other text editors that do

syntax coloring but the syntax will need to be modified.

The list is far from complete, I add to it whenever I come

across a keyword that isn't colored.  Anyone is welcome to

use this but you should let me know so if it changes I can

send you an update.  Also if you do use it and find missing

keywords please send me an updated version.

That's surprising - I've used UltraEdit for many years and don't see any
slowness.  As far as I know I'm using mostly default settings.  The only
time it seems slow is with large files (on the order of 50MB and up).  There
is a setting to control this in Advanced --> Configuration -->File Handling
-->Temporary Files.

By the way, EnergyPlus v7.1 syntax highlighting files are available for
TextPad and UltraEdit (scroll to the bottom of the page).

http://energyplus.helpserve.com/Knowledgebase/List/Index/47

In UltraEdit, the settings for this are found in Advanced--> Configuration
--> Editor Display--> Syntax Highlighting

I use WinMerge (its free) and great for comparing files.

That's surprising - I've used UltraEdit for many years and don't see any slowness.  As far as I know I'm using mostly default settings.  The only time it seems slow is with large files (on the order of 50MB and up).  There is a setting to control this in Advanced --> Configuration -->File Handling -->Temporary Files.

By the way, EnergyPlus v7.1 syntax highlighting files are available for TextPad and UltraEdit (scroll to the bottom of the page).

http://energyplus.helpserve.com/Knowledgebase/List/Index/47

In UltraEdit, the settings for this are found in Advanced--> Configuration --> Editor Display--> Syntax Highlighting

Could I ask how to set the UltraEdit? it seems very slow to open a text file compared to notepad++ and sublime.

Thanks,.

I haven't ventured into Energyplus IDF file editing but for DOE2.1e and DOE2.2, UltraEdit works great.

UltraEdit includes:
Syntax highlighting for programming languages not build included is very easy to add - edit a text file.
Side by side file compare, file merge etc.
Text fold/unfold
Save Copy As
Rectangular selection and column summing - this is handy when examining the results files.

In addition UltraEdit has a fairly decent macro programming feature including Record Keystrokes which is very handy for extracting sections from the results files and copying them into another file.

One nice feature of UltraEdit is the ability to define Projects - a group of files that are to be opened together.

Also, you can run dos commands/programs - handy for command line compiling.  I use it for running DOE2 when debugging an input file.  You can also call Windows programs but I haven't had a need to do that as yet.

I have been using UltraEdit since 1996 - it replaced the dos based editor I had been using, "Brief", a Borland product.  I still use the Brief keystroke commands - UltraEdit allows you to redefine the keystroke commands.

Hi all,

It might be useful for some of us who gets annoyed with notepad.

I did a quick comparison of three text editors: TextPad 6.1.3, Notepad++ 6.1.5 and relatively new Sublime 2.1.

I have selected several features, some of which I found very useful, others somehow useful.

E.g. very useful:

 *   Syntax highlighting,
 *   Side by side file compare (someone may know this feature from Total Commander),
 *   Text fold/unfold(collapse/uncollapse)

Somehow useful:

 *   Save Copy As ... ,
 *   Rectangular selection (used to be in the stone age qedit)

A picture in the attachment shows the results of this comparison.

In brief, NONE of these editors can claim having MORE THAN ONE useful feature!

Your comments and personal experience are very welcome.


Thanks,

I use vim <http://www.vim.org/>extensively. It has a good diff facility
and I can find/ replace based on regular expressions
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression>. You can also execute
commands (e.g. "find /text string/ and replace the Nth following line
with /this string/") .

Vim & emacs are probably the most powerful, extensible text editors but
have quite a leaning curve.

If you hack through text files a lot I recommend that you learn one of them.

Hi,

I have a space that meets the requirements of a "semi-heated" space.
 Question is - how do I model the baseline system?  I have found no
information in AppG, LEED, or any other resources.

Karen,

A "semi-heated" space is not a "conditioned space" per ASHRAE 90.1. For a LEED/Appendix G model, the baseline system type is based on conditioned floor area, and the requirement for modeling heating and cooling applies to conditioned spaces only. You could model the space as unconditioned in the baseline and proposed models, and capture the semi-heating as neutral process energy.

Alternatively, you could use System Type 9 or 10 from ASHRAE 90.1-2010. Systems 9 and 10 apply to "thermal zones designed with heating only systems in the proposed design, serving storage rooms, stairwells, vestibules, electrical/mechanical rooms, and restrooms not exhausting or transferring air from mechanically cooled thermal zones in the proposed design" per G3.1.1 Exception e. The ASHRAE definition for "zone, HVAC" is "a space or group of spaces...", not "a conditioned space...". So I think you could apply System 9 or 10 to a semi-heated space, if the space type is one of those listed.

Either of these options should be easy enough to change/undo if a LEED reviewer disagrees with your approach.

Regards,
Bill

Message-ID: <00e201cd7c83$24b0d0e0$6e1272a0$@com>

What combination of inputs do I need to use to set the outdoor air at a high
fixed ratio of the supply air?  My system is VAV, with a significant portion
that is CAV.  I would like to tie the outdoor airflow to a percentage of the
supply, not calculated by people or square footage.  I tried setting the
minimum outdoor air ratio to 0.85 fraction of design flow (on the system -
outdoor air tab), but it looks like to me that it's calculating 0.85 of
design outdoor airflow, not design supply airflow.  I tried also setting the
min flow ratio to 1.0 (ie CAV) in several zones, but the way that calculates
is (0.85*design outdoor airflow)*1.0.  Help, help.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] System 2 PTHP Compressor Lockout, G3.1.3.1, & MIN-HP-T
Message-ID: <005c01cd7c8e$fc4b83a0$f4e28ae0$@com>

I'm curious how others have been interpreting G3.1.3.1 and when to lock
out the compressors on PTHP units in the Baseline.  I have been setting
the minimum heat pump operational temperature (MIN-HP-T) in such a way as
to allow the heat pump to operate at all hours and allow eQUEST to adjust
the capacity of the heat pump with its own capacity curves.  This allows
the heat pump to run simultaneously with the supplementary electric heat,
albeit at a reduced capacity.



Realistically, no PTHP manufacturers allow their heat pumps to operate
much below 35 deg F.  I have heard from other modelers that they lockout
the compressors at 40 deg F in the baseline.  For those of you out there
who take this approach, how do you justify it?  Has the question come up
in any LEED reviews?



The following is my rationale for not locking out the compressors at 40
deg F:

ASHRAE 90.1-2007 section G3.1.3.1 states:

?G3.1.3.1 Heat Pumps (Systems 2 and 4). Electric air-source heat pumps
shall be modeled with electric auxiliary heat.  The systems shall be
controlled with multistage space thermostats and an outdoor air thermostat
wired to energize auxiliary heat only on the last thermostat stage and
when outdoor air temperature is less than 40?F.?

So the section clearly references System 2 ? PTHP?s.  Then the question
you could ask is what does ?energize auxiliary heat only on the last
thermostat stage? mean?  From USGBC?s Advanced Energy Modeling for LEED
guidelines, page 38:



The guideline says to operate the compressor as low as 17 ?F (low
temperature rating condition using heat pump ARI 340/360 test procedure).
Now PTHP?s are not rated per ARI 340/360 ? they use ARI 310/380.



>From ARI 310/380-2004:



17 ?F is also utilized for PTHP?s.

I've searched the CIR database and could not find any references to this
specific section.

Thanks Bill.  I didn't realize 90.1-2010 gave a little more info on this
topic.  The space is actually pretty large, and doesn't fall under one of
the types you listed in ASHRAE 90.1-2010.  It's a maintenance/garage area
and has less than the required btu/sf for space heating (but some
additional capacity to to temper ventilation air).  There is additional
capacity to make up for outdoor ventilation air, so not modeling the energy
use would be a mistake, I think.  What do you think about modeling the HVAC
systems for the spaces identically in the baseline and proposed?

Karen,

I'm not convinced it makes sense to break out the heating capacity into ventilation and non-ventilation. I would include the total heating capacity of all units serving the garage to determine if it falls under the 3.4 Btu/h-ft2 threshold per the semiheated space definition. If you still think it is a semiheated space then I think you could model the baseline and proposed with identical HVAC systems and consider it process energy. Garage ventilation should probably be considered process energy either way, as it is not just for meeting minimum occupant-based ventilation. If it ends up being a conditioned space, you should be able to apply a System 3 or 4 to the baseline per the other G3.1.1 exceptions (different process loads or schedules, code-required minimum circulation rates, etc.).

Karen and Bill,

 

One interesting caveat to this discussion is that ASHRAE definitions for
conditioned, unconditioned, and semi-heated spaces all apply only to
enclosed spaces, but definition of unconditional space included in 90.1
Section 3 suggests that garages should not be considered enclosed: 

 

unconditioned space: an enclosed space within a building

that is not a conditioned space or a semiheated space.

Crawlspaces, attics, and parking garages with natural or

mechanical ventilation are not considered enclosed spaces.

 

I like Karen's idea of modeling the same system type in the baseline and
proposed model for the garage. I would also look into using exceptional
calculations to claim credit for improvement in equipment efficiency, demand
control ventilation, and fan power relative to allowances in Table
6.5.3.1.1A/B.

Karen,

 

A "semi-heated" space is not a "conditioned space" per ASHRAE 90.1. For a
LEED/Appendix G model, the baseline system type is based on conditioned
floor area, and the requirement for modeling heating and cooling applies to
conditioned spaces only. You could model the space as unconditioned in the
baseline and proposed models, and capture the semi-heating as neutral
process energy.

 

Alternatively, you could use System Type 9 or 10 from ASHRAE 90.1-2010.
Systems 9 and 10 apply to "thermal zones designed with heating only systems
in the proposed design, serving storage rooms, stairwells, vestibules,
electrical/mechanical rooms, and restrooms not exhausting or transferring
air from mechanically cooled thermal zones in the proposed design" per
G3.1.1 Exception e. The ASHRAE definition for "zone, HVAC" is "a space or
group of spaces.", not "a conditioned space.". So I think you could apply
System 9 or 10 to a semi-heated space, if the space type is one of those
listed.

 

Either of these options should be easy enough to change/undo if a LEED
reviewer disagrees with your approach.

 

Regards,

Bill

Hi,

 

I have a space that meets the requirements of a "semi-heated" space.
Question is - how do I model the baseline system?  I have found no
information in AppG, LEED, or any other resources.

 

Thanks,

I?m not sure how much this is worth, but eQUEST?s LEED compliance analysis
module when set to residential with electric heat leaves the PTHP MIN-HP-T
at its default value of 40?F.

Subject: System 2 PTHP Compressor Lockout, G3.1.3.1, & MIN-HP-T



I'm curious how others have been interpreting G3.1.3.1 and when to lock
out the compressors on PTHP units in the Baseline.  I have been setting
the minimum heat pump operational temperature (MIN-HP-T) in such a way as
to allow the heat pump to operate at all hours and allow eQUEST to adjust
the capacity of the heat pump with its own capacity curves.  This allows
the heat pump to run simultaneously with the supplementary electric heat,
albeit at a reduced capacity.



Realistically, no PTHP manufacturers allow their heat pumps to operate
much below 35 deg F.  I have heard from other modelers that they lockout
the compressors at 40 deg F in the baseline.  For those of you out there
who take this approach, how do you justify it?  Has the question come up
in any LEED reviews?



The following is my rationale for not locking out the compressors at 40
deg F:

ASHRAE 90.1-2007 section G3.1.3.1 states:

?G3.1.3.1 Heat Pumps (Systems 2 and 4). Electric air-source heat pumps
shall be modeled with electric auxiliary heat.  The systems shall be
controlled with multistage space thermostats and an outdoor air thermostat
wired to energize auxiliary heat only on the last thermostat stage and
when outdoor air temperature is less than 40?F.?

So the section clearly references System 2 ? PTHP?s.  Then the question
you could ask is what does ?energize auxiliary heat only on the last
thermostat stage? mean?  From USGBC?s Advanced Energy Modeling for LEED
guidelines, page 38:



The guideline says to operate the compressor as low as 17 ?F (low
temperature rating condition using heat pump ARI 340/360 test procedure).
Now PTHP?s are not rated per ARI 340/360 ? they use ARI 310/380.



>From ARI 310/380-2004:



17 ?F is also utilized for PTHP?s.

I've searched the CIR database and could not find any references to this
specific section.

Howdy simulationists,

I'm pleased to announce the creation of two new mailing lists under the
radiance-online.org umbrella, "radiance-daysim", and
"radiance-openstudio". As Radiance integration efforts continue around
Daysim and OpenStudio, we thought it might be nice to offer these focused
mailing lists where users can post Radiance questions in the context of
these two applications. You can subscribe and browse the new lists here:

http://www.radiance-online.org/community/mailing-lists

I would encourage OpenStudio users to continue to post to the OpenStudio
Forums (https://openstudio.nrel.gov/forum) as well, but I believe these
new lists here could attract lots of Radiance folks and collectively
provide a richer knowledge base than I am currently capable of doing on
the OpenStudio forum. I can't speak for Christoph, but I expect he feels
the same way about his Daysim & DIVA forums.

Big thanks to Andy McNeil, Greg Ward, Christoph Reinhart, Rick Mistrick,
and Jan Wienold for coordinating this, and to Daniel Fuller and LBNL for
hosting the lists.

OK, bye.

- Rob

P.S.
When you do go to the radiance-online.org site, how about offering up some
props to Daniel and Andy once again, for the new improved look! =8-)

Sheelam,

You may use the variable refrigerant flow (VRF, VRV) example file that comes with the EnergyPlus
 install. This example demonstrates the use of five terminal units 
(Indoor Coils) connected to a single outdoor unit; each zone served with
 one terminal unit. Currently, EnergyPlus has a heat pump VRF system, 
i.e., it runs in either cooling-only or? heating-only mode. For further 
information refer to the EnergyPlus documentations.

VariableRefrigerantFlow_5Zone.idf

The VRF HVAC model is available in V7.0 and 7.1 EnergyPlus versions only.

This ASHRAE 90.1-2007 interpretation states that Appendix G does not
mandate heat pump compressor cutoff or defrost cycles, and recommends the
manufacturer's control recommendations be followed.  The consensus from
PTHP manufacturer's seems to be no compressors below 40 deg F.

I will put together an interpretation request to specifically address
System 2, but by extension of the logic used in this interpretation it
seems acceptable to set MIN-HP-T to 40 deg F.

*Description*

Modern buildings typically contain envelope systems that require specific
layers to control condensation due to moisture migration and/or air
leakage, dedicated waterproofing systems to protect moisture-sensitive
backup materials (e.g., wood and gypsum-based products), and thermal
insulation to control heat losses and gains. Consequently, building codes
include provisions for these systems in new construction, and in some
cases, renovation projects. As such, architecture and consulting firms
frequently turn to hygrothermal modeling to determine the optimal
arrangement of these layers. This presentation will introduce the
parameters to consider when setting up a model, and through several project
examples, demonstrate how hygrothermal modeling can be used to develop
assemblies with a low risk for moisture-related problems.  Also, critical
to the process, we will touch on some of the limitations and assumptions
made when developing a hygrothermal model.

*About the Speaker*

Cheryl Saldanha works with Simpson Gumpertz & Heger Inc. in New York City.
Cheryl specializes in building science and building-envelope performance,
including the simulation of heat, air, and moisture migration through
assemblies.  She has investigated building enclosure and mechanical system
failures, and designed remedial repairs.

*7:00-7:15 PM    Q & A

7:15-7:45 PM    Analyzing Moisture in Brick Masonry Walls*
*Pallavi Mantha, LEED AP BD+C ? Building Systems Analyst, Steven Winter
Associates, Inc.

Description*

The thermal resistance provided by un-insulated brick walls (R-3 to R-5) is
often insufficient for occupant thermal comfort and energy efficiency in
most climates. Retrofits to brick buildings are usually conducted from the
interior due to both financial and social pressure to preserve the exterior
fa?ade. This seminar will focus on the thermal and hygric behavior of brick
masonry walls with interior retrofit strategies. Key inputs that affect
results and a methodology to comply with failure criteria are discussed.
Analysis and results from research conducted by SWA will be shared.

*About the Speaker*

Pallavi Mantha works with Steven Winter Associates on high performance
buildings and research projects. Her body of work spans numerous
single-family, multifamily and commercial projects. She provides modeling
support for Building America, NYSERDA Multifamily Performance Program
(MPP), Energy Star Multifamily High-Rise (MFHR) and DOE - Commercial
Building Partnership (CBP).

With funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and
DOE?s Building America Program, she has conducted research and published
papers on topics such as internal moisture loads in homes, High-R walls and
hygrothermal performance of hybrid wall systems. Her areas of expertise
include whole building energy modeling, high performance component
modeling, daylighting, passive solar and renewable energy strategies,
building systems research, and data visualization.**

Message-ID: <CAGg=c=7cZgubWQHGxRz9GhUB+vsL3cRTUNO=W3YGDPvBYjoZGA@mail.gmail.com>

Building Simulators,

I'm writing from EcoFactor, a start-up that provides personalized and
real-time energy-efficiency algorithms for residential HVAC. We are
developing the next generation of our building models and looking for
building simulation experts who can contribute to the process.

We collect a vast swathe of data that describes the conditions inside and
outside each home over time. By data-mining a range of physical effects we
can use this data to infer the characteristics of each home without
detailed input from the homeowner. Our next generation algorithms will
further improve the scope and strength of these inferences.

The ideal candidate will be experienced with a wide range of building
models and have a strong intuition of which will work best on our data. The
working arrangement will depend on the candidate, but most likely involve
part-time consultation over several months. We explicitly welcome
applications from remote candidates.

If interested, please reply with your resume, an overview of previous
projects, and a brief description how you'd expect to contribute to
EcoFactor.

Sincerely,
Joe Kwiatkowski

Dear All,

Registration for the BSO12 held at Loughborough University, UK, is still open.

The conference programme and abstracts are available at http://www.bso12.org/-docs/BSO12_Abstract_Handbook.pdf.

As you will see, 57 papers originating from 14 different countries will be presented at the conference. The conference is perhaps the first to give some specific focus to both the development of simulation methods, and their use in model-based design and control optimization.

We hope that some of you will be able to attend what we are sure will be a success and rewarding conference for all.

Regards,

Jon

Message-ID: <CAAKAXiyAvJY4Q6C0YFE8cCi=SUWFCy8LfzOq=Q0v2Lv6UwgkaQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All..
I am working on the live project of the Institute building using Energy
Plus Software.The building have the three Floors(G+2) with total 48
Conditioned Zone. In this building I want to apply the VRF system.For that
i am facing the problem of connecting the Terminal Unit to the
condenser.The software shows the following comment-

** Severe  **ZoneHVAC:TerminalUnit:VariableRefrigerantFlow "TU21"
   **   ~~~   ** ... when checking COIL:Cooling:DX:VariableRefrigerantFlow
"TU21 VRF DX COOLING COIL"
   **   ~~~   ** ... terminal unit not connected to condenser.
   **   ~~~   ** ... check that terminal unit is specified in a terminal
unit list object.
   **   ~~~   ** ... also check that the terminal unit list name is
specified in an AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow object.

In the Variable Refrigerant Flow Equipment option the Zone terminal unit
List have the limitation of feeding only 20 names and I also want to
introduce rest of the terminal Units to the VRF Segment. Please suggest me
how can i add the other Terminal Units to the VRF segment.

All suggestions are appreciated.

[https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/images/cleardot.gif]
Good afternoon energy modelers!

Join us Tuesday, September 18 for the next meeting of the Rocky Mountain Energy Simulation Engineers (RMESE). Members of the NREL commercial building analysis tools team will be on hand to provide a sneak preview of the upcoming 0.9 release of OpenStudio including new tools to edit constructions, chilled and service water systems, and more.  You'll also get a better idea of what DOE is trying to accomplish with this free, analysis software development kit, and where we're heading in the next few months.

We will be meeting at The Tavern Downtown in downtown Denver at 6:00 pm on Tuesday, September 18 for a short presentation and drinks. The Tavern Downtown is located at 1949 Market St, Denver, CO 80202.

There will be a $10 fee associated with your attendance to cover the cost of the venue. You will receive one drink ticket and appetizers with your attendance fee. Please RSVP to Jessie Jones at jjones at rmhgroup.com<mailto:jjones at rmhgroup.com> or (303)312-4641<tel:%28303%29312-4641> so that we can reserve enough space to accommodate everyone. This is not invite only- so pass the word on to coworkers, colleagues, and other industry professionals who may be interested.

Thank you,

RMESE Steering Committee

Hi Jeff, we haven't done this before, so I'll have to investigate and get

? and I?d also be interested.

p.s., Will you address how OpenStudio works alongside or competes with Simergy?

Thanks to everyone who has expressed interest and/or offered to help us
stream the meeting.  We're still deciding what we will do.  However, I've
learned that NREL will be offering a two-day OpenStudio workshop on October
22-23.  The planners are aware that there is interest in streaming or
recording that workshop.  That might be a better option for everyone rather
than attempting to stream from a sports bar!

I think it would be extremely useful to have the OpenStudio workshop in
October available as a webinar on the days of the actual workshop as well as
a recording that could be viewed later.

Good afternoon energy modelers!

Join us Tuesday, September 18 for the next meeting of the Rocky Mountain
Energy Simulation Engineers (RMESE). Members of the NREL commercial building
analysis tools team will be on hand to provide a sneak preview of the
upcoming 0.9 release of OpenStudio including new tools to edit
constructions, chilled and service water systems, and more.  You'll also get
a better idea of what DOE is trying to accomplish with this free, analysis
software development kit, and where we're heading in the next few months. 

 

We will be meeting at The Tavern Downtown in downtown Denver at 6:00 pm on
Tuesday, September 18 for a short presentation and drinks. The Tavern
Downtown is located at 1949 Market St, Denver, CO 80202. 

 

There will be a $10 fee associated with your attendance to cover the cost of
the venue. You will receive one drink ticket and appetizers with your
attendance fee. Please RSVP to Jessie Jones at jjones at rmhgroup.com or
(303)312-4641 <tel:%28303%29312-4641>  so that we can reserve enough space
to accommodate everyone. This is not invite only- so pass the word on to
coworkers, colleagues, and other industry professionals who may be
interested. 

 

Thank you,

 

RMESE Steering Committee

Message-ID: <06c301cd857a$ee5785b0$cb069110$@com>

Hi - I've got an appendix G baseline system question.  Here's the
scenario, let me know what you think.  

 

Proposed Building:

 

1.       Multi-family residential, amenity/common space < 20,000 square
feet

2.       Electric baseboard heat in the units

3.       Condensing gas furnaces in the corridors and back of house spaces

4.       VRF in amenity common spaces

 

My understanding is that because my non-predominant condition
(common/amenity space) is less than 20,000 square feet, I use a single
system for the whole baseline building (G3.1.1a).  I've got a mix of gas
and electric heat in the baseline building,  does this mean that my base
system is PTAC with a hot water boiler?

 

Thanks!

Morgan,

I agree with Bill.  I find this LEED CIR (see below) to be helpful in
determining how fossil/electric hybrid systems should be handled.  Your
scenario sounds similar to item 5 under the examples of systems that would
be modeled with fossil fuel heating.

Ruling

Clarification is requested regarding when a building heat source in Table
G3.1.1A should be identified as "Fossil/Electric Hybrid" versus "Electric".

The ASHRAE 90.1-2007 User's Manual states that a fossil/electric hybrid
source "refers to a system with any combination of fossil and electric
heat, and the baseline system for this is a fossil fuel system". Therefore,
the heating source for the proposed building would be considered "Fossil
Fuel" or "Fossil/Electric Hybrid" if the building uses any fossil fuel
source for space heating (including backup heating or preheating), and the
baseline building heat source would be fossil fuel.

Exception: ASHRAE 90.1 Section G3.1.1 Exception (a) stipulates additional
system type(s) for non-predominant conditions (i.e.
residential/non-residential or heating source) if those conditions apply to
more than 20,000 square feet of conditioned floor area.

EXAMPLES OF BASELINE HEATING SOURCE DETERMINATION:

The Baseline heat source from Table G3.1.1A for the following Proposed Case
system types would be fossil fuel since the proposed system design includes
a combination of fossil and electric heat:

1. Variable air volume system with gas furnace preheat and electric reheat
2. Packaged terminal heat pumps with outside air tempered by fossil fuel
furnace
3. Water source heat pumps with fossil fuel boiler
4. Ground source heat pumps with backup fossil fuel boiler
5. 90,000 square feet is conditioned by a variable air volume system with
electric reheat, and 10,000 square feet is conditioned with fossil fuel
furnaces

The following buildings would be modeled with an additional system type
with a different Baseline heating source in accordance with Section G3.1.1
Exception (a):

1. 90,000 square feet is conditioned by a variable air volume system with
electric reheat, and 20,000 square feet is conditioned with Packaged DX
systems with fossil fuel furnaces. In this case, the 90,000 square feet of
area would be modeled with an electric heat source in the Baseline Case
(System Type #6 - Packaged VAV with Electric PFP Boxes), and the 20,000
square feet of area would be modeled with a fossil fuel heat source in the
Baseline Case (System Type #3 - Packaged Single Zone AC with fossil fuel
furnace).
2. 50,000 square feet is conditioned by water source heat pumps with a
fossil fuel boiler, and 25,000 square feet is conditioned by electric heat
pumps. In this case, the 50,000 square feet of area would be modeled with a
fossil fuel heat source in the Baseline Case (System Type #5 - Packaged VAV
with hot water reheat), and the 25,000 square feet of area would be modeled
with an electric heat source in the Baseline Case (System Type #4 -
Packaged Single Zone Heat Pump).

Applicable Internationally.
Formal Inquiry

Table G3.1.1A lists two possible categories for the building heating
source:
(1) Fossil fuel, fossil/electric hybrid, & purchased heat;
(2) Electric and other.

In cases where the proposed building design includes both a natural gas
heating source and an electric heating source, when should the heat source

I think that in Morgan's case using PTHP baseline is also justified. From
what I understand, the project is a residential buildings with electrically
heated living units and gas-heated common spaces. Applying G3.1.1 to the
project, predominant conditions are residential with electricity as heat
source; non-predominant conditions are non-residential with fossil fuel
heat. Based on G3.1.1 exception (a), non-predominant conditions accounting
for less than 20,000 SF may be ignored when selecting the baseline system
from Table G3.1.1A, thus the baseline for the project is PTHP. If
residential units were served by WSHP, then predominant conditions would be
residential with Fossil/Electric Hybrid heating source, and the baseline
system would by PTAC.

Morgan,

 

I agree with Bill.  I find this LEED CIR (see below) to be helpful in
determining how fossil/electric hybrid systems should be handled.  Your
scenario sounds similar to item 5 under the examples of systems that would
be modeled with fossil fuel heating.

Ruling


Clarification is requested regarding when a building heat source in Table
G3.1.1A should be identified as "Fossil/Electric Hybrid" versus "Electric". 

The ASHRAE 90.1-2007 User's Manual states that a fossil/electric hybrid
source "refers to a system with any combination of fossil and electric heat,
and the baseline system for this is a fossil fuel system". Therefore, the
heating source for the proposed building would be considered "Fossil Fuel"
or "Fossil/Electric Hybrid" if the building uses any fossil fuel source for
space heating (including backup heating or preheating), and the baseline
building heat source would be fossil fuel.

Exception: ASHRAE 90.1 Section G3.1.1 Exception (a) stipulates additional
system type(s) for non-predominant conditions (i.e.
residential/non-residential or heating source) if those conditions apply to
more than 20,000 square feet of conditioned floor area. 

EXAMPLES OF BASELINE HEATING SOURCE DETERMINATION: 

The Baseline heat source from Table G3.1.1A for the following Proposed Case
system types would be fossil fuel since the proposed system design includes
a combination of fossil and electric heat:

1. Variable air volume system with gas furnace preheat and electric reheat
2. Packaged terminal heat pumps with outside air tempered by fossil fuel
furnace
3. Water source heat pumps with fossil fuel boiler
4. Ground source heat pumps with backup fossil fuel boiler
5. 90,000 square feet is conditioned by a variable air volume system with
electric reheat, and 10,000 square feet is conditioned with fossil fuel
furnaces

The following buildings would be modeled with an additional system type with
a different Baseline heating source in accordance with Section G3.1.1
Exception (a):

1. 90,000 square feet is conditioned by a variable air volume system with
electric reheat, and 20,000 square feet is conditioned with Packaged DX
systems with fossil fuel furnaces. In this case, the 90,000 square feet of
area would be modeled with an electric heat source in the Baseline Case
(System Type #6 - Packaged VAV with Electric PFP Boxes), and the 20,000
square feet of area would be modeled with a fossil fuel heat source in the
Baseline Case (System Type #3 - Packaged Single Zone AC with fossil fuel
furnace).
2. 50,000 square feet is conditioned by water source heat pumps with a
fossil fuel boiler, and 25,000 square feet is conditioned by electric heat
pumps. In this case, the 50,000 square feet of area would be modeled with a
fossil fuel heat source in the Baseline Case (System Type #5 - Packaged VAV
with hot water reheat), and the 25,000 square feet of area would be modeled
with an electric heat source in the Baseline Case (System Type #4 - Packaged
Single Zone Heat Pump).

Applicable Internationally.


Formal Inquiry


Table G3.1.1A lists two possible categories for the building heating source:

(1) Fossil fuel, fossil/electric hybrid, & purchased heat; 
(2) Electric and other. 

In cases where the proposed building design includes both a natural gas
heating source and an electric heating source, when should the heat source
in Table G3.1.1A be identified as "Fossil/Electric Hybrid" versus
"Electric"?

Maria,

I'd have to disagree with you.  No where in G3.1.1 exception (a) does it
say that you can ignore non-predominant conditions.  In fact, if you read
the CIR I quoted it very clearly states an example where 90% of the
building is electric heat and the other 10% is gas-heat (less than 20,000
SF) and the baseline model is determined to be Fossil/Electric Hybrid.

You may be thinking of the footnote to Table G3.1.1A which states "Where
attributes make a building eligible for more than one baseline system type,
use the predominant condition to determine the system type for the entire
building."  However, the CIR is counter to this, and since Table G3.1.1A
includes a category for Fossil/Electric Hybrid, your building would only
fall into one category.

Vinany - the CIR addresses that exact scenario and states that gas
furnace-fired DOAS puts you into the Fossil/Electric Hybrid category and
your baseline would be System 1 PTAC with HW.

Morgan,

I agree with Bill.  I find this LEED CIR (see below) to be helpful in determining how fossil/electric hybrid systems should be handled.  Your scenario sounds similar to item 5 under the examples of systems that would be modeled with fossil fuel heating.

Ruling

Clarification is requested regarding when a building heat source in Table G3.1.1A should be identified as "Fossil/Electric Hybrid" versus "Electric".

The ASHRAE 90.1-2007 User's Manual states that a fossil/electric hybrid source "refers to a system with any combination of fossil and electric heat, and the baseline system for this is a fossil fuel system". Therefore, the heating source for the proposed building would be considered "Fossil Fuel" or "Fossil/Electric Hybrid" if the building uses any fossil fuel source for space heating (including backup heating or preheating), and the baseline building heat source would be fossil fuel.

Exception: ASHRAE 90.1 Section G3.1.1 Exception (a) stipulates additional system type(s) for non-predominant conditions (i.e. residential/non-residential or heating source) if those conditions apply to more than 20,000 square feet of conditioned floor area.

EXAMPLES OF BASELINE HEATING SOURCE DETERMINATION:

The Baseline heat source from Table G3.1.1A for the following Proposed Case system types would be fossil fuel since the proposed system design includes a combination of fossil and electric heat:

1. Variable air volume system with gas furnace preheat and electric reheat
2. Packaged terminal heat pumps with outside air tempered by fossil fuel furnace
3. Water source heat pumps with fossil fuel boiler
4. Ground source heat pumps with backup fossil fuel boiler
5. 90,000 square feet is conditioned by a variable air volume system with electric reheat, and 10,000 square feet is conditioned with fossil fuel furnaces

The following buildings would be modeled with an additional system type with a different Baseline heating source in accordance with Section G3.1.1 Exception (a):

1. 90,000 square feet is conditioned by a variable air volume system with electric reheat, and 20,000 square feet is conditioned with Packaged DX systems with fossil fuel furnaces. In this case, the 90,000 square feet of area would be modeled with an electric heat source in the Baseline Case (System Type #6 - Packaged VAV with Electric PFP Boxes), and the 20,000 square feet of area would be modeled with a fossil fuel heat source in the Baseline Case (System Type #3 - Packaged Single Zone AC with fossil fuel furnace).
2. 50,000 square feet is conditioned by water source heat pumps with a fossil fuel boiler, and 25,000 square feet is conditioned by electric heat pumps. In this case, the 50,000 square feet of area would be modeled with a fossil fuel heat source in the Baseline Case (System Type #5 - Packaged VAV with hot water reheat), and the 25,000 square feet of area would be modeled with an electric heat source in the Baseline Case (System Type #4 - Packaged Single Zone Heat Pump).

Applicable Internationally.

Formal Inquiry

Table G3.1.1A lists two possible categories for the building heating source:
(1) Fossil fuel, fossil/electric hybrid, & purchased heat;
(2) Electric and other.

In cases where the proposed building design includes both a natural gas heating source and an electric heating source, when should the heat source in Table G3.1.1A be identified as "Fossil/Electric Hybrid" versus "Electric"?

Hi - I've got an appendix G baseline system question.  Here's the scenario, let me know what you think.  <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>
 <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>
Proposed Building:<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>
 <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>

1.       Multi-family residential, amenity/common space < 20,000 square feet<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>

2.       Electric baseboard heat in the units<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>

3.       Condensing gas furnaces in the corridors and back of house spaces<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>

4.       VRF in amenity common spaces<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>
 <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>
My understanding is that because my non-predominant condition (common/amenity space) is less than 20,000 square feet, I use a single system for the whole baseline building (G3.1.1a).  I've got a mix of gas and electric heat in the baseline building,  does this mean that my base system is PTAC with a hot water boiler?<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>

Interesting.  That is obviously the more logical approach, however we now
have two conflicting interpretations.  The 90.1 interpretation is more
recent than the LEED CIR.  I'm not sure how one would go about challenging
an existing CIR to get it corrected.  Does anyone have any experience with
this?

Also, the interpretation does not shed any light on a fossil fuel
preheat/DOAS system serving an electric heating system.  I would assume
that this system would still be classified as Fossil/Electric hybhrid and
thus compare to a fossil fuel baseline.

Thanks for sharing this Michael! 

 

Robby, I don't believe LEED CIRs are precedent-setting. In addition, many
Appendix G models are developed for programs other than LEED (e.g. incentive
programs) where LEED rulings don't matter. I would use PTHP on a LEED
project for the situation described by Morgan, referencing G3.1.1 exception
(a), footnote to Table G3.1.1A, and the ASHRAE interpretation that Michael
brought up. I don't think CIR meant to change ASHRAE rules, it just
misinterpreted how they apply to this example . For Vinay's project, I would
use PTAC in the baseline since apartments use both gas and electricity as
heating source, so fall under Fossil/Electric Hybrid category.

Interesting.  That is obviously the more logical approach, however we now
have two conflicting interpretations.  The 90.1 interpretation is more
recent than the LEED CIR.  I'm not sure how one would go about challenging
an existing CIR to get it corrected.  Does anyone have any experience with
this?  

 

Also, the interpretation does not shed any light on a fossil fuel
preheat/DOAS system serving an electric heating system.  I would assume that
this system would still be classified as Fossil/Electric hybhrid and thus
compare to a fossil fuel baseline.

Maria,

 

I'd have to disagree with you.  No where in G3.1.1 exception (a) does it say
that you can ignore non-predominant conditions.  In fact, if you read the
CIR I quoted it very clearly states an example where 90% of the building is
electric heat and the other 10% is gas-heat (less than 20,000 SF) and the
baseline model is determined to be Fossil/Electric Hybrid.  

 

You may be thinking of the footnote to Table G3.1.1A which states "Where
attributes make a building eligible for more than one baseline system type,
use the predominant condition to determine the system type for the entire
building."  However, the CIR is counter to this, and since Table G3.1.1A
includes a category for Fossil/Electric Hybrid, your building would only
fall into one category.

 

Vinany - the CIR addresses that exact scenario and states that gas
furnace-fired DOAS puts you into the Fossil/Electric Hybrid category and
your baseline would be System 1 PTAC with HW.

I think that in Morgan's case using PTHP baseline is also justified. From
what I understand, the project is a residential buildings with electrically
heated living units and gas-heated common spaces. Applying G3.1.1 to the
project, predominant conditions are residential with electricity as heat
source; non-predominant conditions are non-residential with fossil fuel
heat. Based on G3.1.1 exception (a), non-predominant conditions accounting
for less than 20,000 SF may be ignored when selecting the baseline system
from Table G3.1.1A, thus the baseline for the project is PTHP. If
residential units were served by WSHP, then predominant conditions would be
residential with Fossil/Electric Hybrid heating source, and the baseline
system would by PTAC.

Morgan,

 

I agree with Bill.  I find this LEED CIR (see below) to be helpful in
determining how fossil/electric hybrid systems should be handled.  Your
scenario sounds similar to item 5 under the examples of systems that would
be modeled with fossil fuel heating.

Ruling


Clarification is requested regarding when a building heat source in Table
G3.1.1A should be identified as "Fossil/Electric Hybrid" versus "Electric". 

The ASHRAE 90.1-2007 User's Manual states that a fossil/electric hybrid
source "refers to a system with any combination of fossil and electric heat,
and the baseline system for this is a fossil fuel system". Therefore, the
heating source for the proposed building would be considered "Fossil Fuel"
or "Fossil/Electric Hybrid" if the building uses any fossil fuel source for
space heating (including backup heating or preheating), and the baseline
building heat source would be fossil fuel.

Exception: ASHRAE 90.1 Section G3.1.1 Exception (a) stipulates additional
system type(s) for non-predominant conditions (i.e.
residential/non-residential or heating source) if those conditions apply to
more than 20,000 square feet of conditioned floor area. 

EXAMPLES OF BASELINE HEATING SOURCE DETERMINATION: 

The Baseline heat source from Table G3.1.1A for the following Proposed Case
system types would be fossil fuel since the proposed system design includes
a combination of fossil and electric heat:

1. Variable air volume system with gas furnace preheat and electric reheat
2. Packaged terminal heat pumps with outside air tempered by fossil fuel
furnace
3. Water source heat pumps with fossil fuel boiler
4. Ground source heat pumps with backup fossil fuel boiler
5. 90,000 square feet is conditioned by a variable air volume system with
electric reheat, and 10,000 square feet is conditioned with fossil fuel
furnaces

The following buildings would be modeled with an additional system type with
a different Baseline heating source in accordance with Section G3.1.1
Exception (a):

1. 90,000 square feet is conditioned by a variable air volume system with
electric reheat, and 20,000 square feet is conditioned with Packaged DX
systems with fossil fuel furnaces. In this case, the 90,000 square feet of
area would be modeled with an electric heat source in the Baseline Case
(System Type #6 - Packaged VAV with Electric PFP Boxes), and the 20,000
square feet of area would be modeled with a fossil fuel heat source in the
Baseline Case (System Type #3 - Packaged Single Zone AC with fossil fuel
furnace).
2. 50,000 square feet is conditioned by water source heat pumps with a
fossil fuel boiler, and 25,000 square feet is conditioned by electric heat
pumps. In this case, the 50,000 square feet of area would be modeled with a
fossil fuel heat source in the Baseline Case (System Type #5 - Packaged VAV
with hot water reheat), and the 25,000 square feet of area would be modeled
with an electric heat source in the Baseline Case (System Type #4 - Packaged
Single Zone Heat Pump).

Applicable Internationally.


Formal Inquiry


Table G3.1.1A lists two possible categories for the building heating source:

(1) Fossil fuel, fossil/electric hybrid, & purchased heat; 
(2) Electric and other. 

In cases where the proposed building design includes both a natural gas
heating source and an electric heating source, when should the heat source
in Table G3.1.1A be identified as "Fossil/Electric Hybrid" versus
"Electric"?

 <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com> Hi - I've got an appendix G baseline
system question.  Here's the scenario, let me know what you think.  

 <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>  

 <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com> Proposed Building:

 <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>  

 <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com> 1.       Multi-family residential,

 <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com> 2.       Electric baseboard heat in the
units

 <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com> 3.       Condensing gas furnaces in the
corridors and back of house spaces

 <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com> 4.       VRF in amenity common spaces

 <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>  

 <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com> My understanding is that because my
non-predominant condition (common/amenity space) is less than 20,000 square
feet, I use a single system for the whole baseline building (G3.1.1a).  I've
got a mix of gas and electric heat in the baseline building,  does this mean
that my base system is PTAC with a hot water boiler?

Maria,

LEED CIRs are precedent setting under LEED.  Any CIR that gets posted to
the CIR database is considered precedent setting.  I agree, the group that
wrote that CIR was misinterpreting the standard, but without the
interpretation that Michael just posted we would've had no real way to
argue against it if it came up as a review comment.  Moving forward I would
proceed as you recommend for Morgan's scenario.

Either way it's unfortunate that the baseline exceptions are limited by
20,000 SF of floor area.  On a small project you can end up with some very
awkward fuel switching scenarios between baseline and proposed.  I would
appreciate a 20,000 SF OR X% of the total building area, whichever is
smaller.

Well that 90.1 Interpretation makes everything clear as mud. There is no formal definition for "hybrid" system in the Standard, and it is only explained in the User's manual. A "predominantly" electric-heated system with some fossil fuel is still a hybrid. Otherwise, what is a hybrid system?

Interesting.  That is obviously the more logical approach, however we now have two conflicting interpretations.  The 90.1 interpretation is more recent than the LEED CIR.  I'm not sure how one would go about challenging an existing CIR to get it corrected.  Does anyone have any experience with this?

Also, the interpretation does not shed any light on a fossil fuel preheat/DOAS system serving an electric heating system.  I would assume that this system would still be classified as Fossil/Electric hybhrid and thus compare to a fossil fuel baseline.

Maria,

I'd have to disagree with you.  No where in G3.1.1 exception (a) does it say that you can ignore non-predominant conditions.  In fact, if you read the CIR I quoted it very clearly states an example where 90% of the building is electric heat and the other 10% is gas-heat (less than 20,000 SF) and the baseline model is determined to be Fossil/Electric Hybrid.

You may be thinking of the footnote to Table G3.1.1A which states "Where attributes make a building eligible for more than one baseline system type, use the predominant condition to determine the system type for the entire building."  However, the CIR is counter to this, and since Table G3.1.1A includes a category for Fossil/Electric Hybrid, your building would only fall into one category.

Vinany - the CIR addresses that exact scenario and states that gas furnace-fired DOAS puts you into the Fossil/Electric Hybrid category and your baseline would be System 1 PTAC with HW.

I think that in Morgan's case using PTHP baseline is also justified. From what I understand, the project is a residential buildings with electrically heated living units and gas-heated common spaces. Applying G3.1.1 to the project, predominant conditions are residential with electricity as heat source; non-predominant conditions are non-residential with fossil fuel heat. Based on G3.1.1 exception (a), non-predominant conditions accounting for less than 20,000 SF may be ignored when selecting the baseline system from Table G3.1.1A, thus the baseline for the project is PTHP. If residential units were served by WSHP, then predominant conditions would be residential with Fossil/Electric Hybrid heating source, and the baseline system would by PTAC.

Morgan,

I agree with Bill.  I find this LEED CIR (see below) to be helpful in determining how fossil/electric hybrid systems should be handled.  Your scenario sounds similar to item 5 under the examples of systems that would be modeled with fossil fuel heating.

Ruling

Clarification is requested regarding when a building heat source in Table G3.1.1A should be identified as "Fossil/Electric Hybrid" versus "Electric".

The ASHRAE 90.1-2007 User's Manual states that a fossil/electric hybrid source "refers to a system with any combination of fossil and electric heat, and the baseline system for this is a fossil fuel system". Therefore, the heating source for the proposed building would be considered "Fossil Fuel" or "Fossil/Electric Hybrid" if the building uses any fossil fuel source for space heating (including backup heating or preheating), and the baseline building heat source would be fossil fuel.

Exception: ASHRAE 90.1 Section G3.1.1 Exception (a) stipulates additional system type(s) for non-predominant conditions (i.e. residential/non-residential or heating source) if those conditions apply to more than 20,000 square feet of conditioned floor area.

EXAMPLES OF BASELINE HEATING SOURCE DETERMINATION:

The Baseline heat source from Table G3.1.1A for the following Proposed Case system types would be fossil fuel since the proposed system design includes a combination of fossil and electric heat:

1. Variable air volume system with gas furnace preheat and electric reheat
2. Packaged terminal heat pumps with outside air tempered by fossil fuel furnace
3. Water source heat pumps with fossil fuel boiler
4. Ground source heat pumps with backup fossil fuel boiler
5. 90,000 square feet is conditioned by a variable air volume system with electric reheat, and 10,000 square feet is conditioned with fossil fuel furnaces

The following buildings would be modeled with an additional system type with a different Baseline heating source in accordance with Section G3.1.1 Exception (a):

1. 90,000 square feet is conditioned by a variable air volume system with electric reheat, and 20,000 square feet is conditioned with Packaged DX systems with fossil fuel furnaces. In this case, the 90,000 square feet of area would be modeled with an electric heat source in the Baseline Case (System Type #6 - Packaged VAV with Electric PFP Boxes), and the 20,000 square feet of area would be modeled with a fossil fuel heat source in the Baseline Case (System Type #3 - Packaged Single Zone AC with fossil fuel furnace).
2. 50,000 square feet is conditioned by water source heat pumps with a fossil fuel boiler, and 25,000 square feet is conditioned by electric heat pumps. In this case, the 50,000 square feet of area would be modeled with a fossil fuel heat source in the Baseline Case (System Type #5 - Packaged VAV with hot water reheat), and the 25,000 square feet of area would be modeled with an electric heat source in the Baseline Case (System Type #4 - Packaged Single Zone Heat Pump).

Applicable Internationally.

Formal Inquiry

Table G3.1.1A lists two possible categories for the building heating source:
(1) Fossil fuel, fossil/electric hybrid, & purchased heat;
(2) Electric and other.

In cases where the proposed building design includes both a natural gas heating source and an electric heating source, when should the heat source in Table G3.1.1A be identified as "Fossil/Electric Hybrid" versus "Electric"?

Hi - I've got an appendix G baseline system question.  Here's the scenario, let me know what you think.  <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>
 <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>
Proposed Building:<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>
 <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>

1.       Multi-family residential, amenity/common space < 20,000 square feet<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>

2.       Electric baseboard heat in the units<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>

3.       Condensing gas furnaces in the corridors and back of house spaces<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>

4.       VRF in amenity common spaces<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>
 <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>
My understanding is that because my non-predominant condition (common/amenity space) is less than 20,000 square feet, I use a single system for the whole baseline building (G3.1.1a).  I've got a mix of gas and electric heat in the baseline building,  does this mean that my base system is PTAC with a hot water boiler?<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>

It is worth noting there is a difference between LEED Interpretations and
LEED Project Credit Interpretation Rulings, as far as being precedent
setting.

Bill,

 

I did not dig for an official definition, but thought that hybrid means that
the same area is heated with both electricity and fossil fuel, such as with
WSHP or the system in Vinay's example. If some areas are heated only with
electricity, and others only with fossil fuels,  I would apply the
non-predominant condition rule to decide on the baseline HVAC.

Well that 90.1 Interpretation makes everything clear as mud. There is no
formal definition for "hybrid" system in the Standard, and it is only
explained in the User's manual. A "predominantly" electric-heated system
with some fossil fuel is still a hybrid. Otherwise, what is a hybrid system?

Interesting.  That is obviously the more logical approach, however we now
have two conflicting interpretations.  The 90.1 interpretation is more
recent than the LEED CIR.  I'm not sure how one would go about challenging
an existing CIR to get it corrected.  Does anyone have any experience with
this?  

 

Also, the interpretation does not shed any light on a fossil fuel
preheat/DOAS system serving an electric heating system.  I would assume that
this system would still be classified as Fossil/Electric hybhrid and thus
compare to a fossil fuel baseline.

Maria,

 

I'd have to disagree with you.  No where in G3.1.1 exception (a) does it say
that you can ignore non-predominant conditions.  In fact, if you read the
CIR I quoted it very clearly states an example where 90% of the building is
electric heat and the other 10% is gas-heat (less than 20,000 SF) and the
baseline model is determined to be Fossil/Electric Hybrid.  

 

You may be thinking of the footnote to Table G3.1.1A which states "Where
attributes make a building eligible for more than one baseline system type,
use the predominant condition to determine the system type for the entire
building."  However, the CIR is counter to this, and since Table G3.1.1A
includes a category for Fossil/Electric Hybrid, your building would only
fall into one category.

 

Vinany - the CIR addresses that exact scenario and states that gas
furnace-fired DOAS puts you into the Fossil/Electric Hybrid category and
your baseline would be System 1 PTAC with HW.

Morgan,

 

I agree with Bill.  I find this LEED CIR (see below) to be helpful in
determining how fossil/electric hybrid systems should be handled.  Your
scenario sounds similar to item 5 under the examples of systems that would
be modeled with fossil fuel heating.

Ruling


Clarification is requested regarding when a building heat source in Table
G3.1.1A should be identified as "Fossil/Electric Hybrid" versus "Electric". 

The ASHRAE 90.1-2007 User's Manual states that a fossil/electric hybrid
source "refers to a system with any combination of fossil and electric heat,
and the baseline system for this is a fossil fuel system". Therefore, the
heating source for the proposed building would be considered "Fossil Fuel"
or "Fossil/Electric Hybrid" if the building uses any fossil fuel source for
space heating (including backup heating or preheating), and the baseline
building heat source would be fossil fuel.

Exception: ASHRAE 90.1 Section G3.1.1 Exception (a) stipulates additional
system type(s) for non-predominant conditions (i.e.
residential/non-residential or heating source) if those conditions apply to
more than 20,000 square feet of conditioned floor area. 

EXAMPLES OF BASELINE HEATING SOURCE DETERMINATION: 

The Baseline heat source from Table G3.1.1A for the following Proposed Case
system types would be fossil fuel since the proposed system design includes
a combination of fossil and electric heat:

1. Variable air volume system with gas furnace preheat and electric reheat
2. Packaged terminal heat pumps with outside air tempered by fossil fuel
furnace
3. Water source heat pumps with fossil fuel boiler
4. Ground source heat pumps with backup fossil fuel boiler
5. 90,000 square feet is conditioned by a variable air volume system with
electric reheat, and 10,000 square feet is conditioned with fossil fuel
furnaces

The following buildings would be modeled with an additional system type with
a different Baseline heating source in accordance with Section G3.1.1
Exception (a):

1. 90,000 square feet is conditioned by a variable air volume system with
electric reheat, and 20,000 square feet is conditioned with Packaged DX
systems with fossil fuel furnaces. In this case, the 90,000 square feet of
area would be modeled with an electric heat source in the Baseline Case
(System Type #6 - Packaged VAV with Electric PFP Boxes), and the 20,000
square feet of area would be modeled with a fossil fuel heat source in the
Baseline Case (System Type #3 - Packaged Single Zone AC with fossil fuel
furnace).
2. 50,000 square feet is conditioned by water source heat pumps with a
fossil fuel boiler, and 25,000 square feet is conditioned by electric heat
pumps. In this case, the 50,000 square feet of area would be modeled with a
fossil fuel heat source in the Baseline Case (System Type #5 - Packaged VAV
with hot water reheat), and the 25,000 square feet of area would be modeled
with an electric heat source in the Baseline Case (System Type #4 - Packaged
Single Zone Heat Pump).

Applicable Internationally.


Formal Inquiry


Table G3.1.1A lists two possible categories for the building heating source:

(1) Fossil fuel, fossil/electric hybrid, & purchased heat; 
(2) Electric and other. 

In cases where the proposed building design includes both a natural gas
heating source and an electric heating source, when should the heat source
in Table G3.1.1A be identified as "Fossil/Electric Hybrid" versus
"Electric"?

In the ASHRAE interpretation that Mr. Rosenberg highlighted, the interesting thing that is missing is ventilation and exhaust. What if the questioner had said 'exhaust fans in the guestroom toilets, no ventilation at the PTAC, transferring air under the hallway door, outside air in rooftop unit determined based on needed guestroom toilet make up'?  Would that have made it a "hybrid"?

I suspect the design did that and thus heated outside air at the rooftop with natural gas.  And the interpretation let the project use the entirely electrically heated baseline with a good portion of electric resistance heating.  While USBGC/GBCI anticipated that (#2 in their list) and said "hybrid".

It is increasingly tougher problem to avoid crediting fuel switching.  We will all just keep doing the best we can.

Ruling

Clarification is requested regarding when a building heat source in Table G3.1.1A should be identified as "Fossil/Electric Hybrid" versus "Electric".

The ASHRAE 90.1-2007 User's Manual states that a fossil/electric hybrid source "refers to a system with any combination of fossil and electric heat, and the baseline system for this is a fossil fuel system". Therefore, the heating source for the proposed building would be considered "Fossil Fuel" or "Fossil/Electric Hybrid" if the building uses any fossil fuel source for space heating (including backup heating or preheating), and the baseline building heat source would be fossil fuel.

Exception: ASHRAE 90.1 Section G3.1.1 Exception (a) stipulates additional system type(s) for non-predominant conditions (i.e. residential/non-residential or heating source) if those conditions apply to more than 20,000 square feet of conditioned floor area.

EXAMPLES OF BASELINE HEATING SOURCE DETERMINATION:

The Baseline heat source from Table G3.1.1A for the following Proposed Case system types would be fossil fuel since the proposed system design includes a combination of fossil and electric heat:

1. Variable air volume system with gas furnace preheat and electric reheat
2. Packaged terminal heat pumps with outside air tempered by fossil fuel furnace
3. Water source heat pumps with fossil fuel boiler
4. Ground source heat pumps with backup fossil fuel boiler
5. 90,000 square feet is conditioned by a variable air volume system with electric reheat, and 10,000 square feet is conditioned with fossil fuel furnaces

The following buildings would be modeled with an additional system type with a different Baseline heating source in accordance with Section G3.1.1 Exception (a):

1. 90,000 square feet is conditioned by a variable air volume system with electric reheat, and 20,000 square feet is conditioned with Packaged DX systems with fossil fuel furnaces. In this case, the 90,000 square feet of area would be modeled with an electric heat source in the Baseline Case (System Type #6 - Packaged VAV with Electric PFP Boxes), and the 20,000 square feet of area would be modeled with a fossil fuel heat source in the Baseline Case (System Type #3 - Packaged Single Zone AC with fossil fuel furnace).
2. 50,000 square feet is conditioned by water source heat pumps with a fossil fuel boiler, and 25,000 square feet is conditioned by electric heat pumps. In this case, the 50,000 square feet of area would be modeled with a fossil fuel heat source in the Baseline Case (System Type #5 - Packaged VAV with hot water reheat), and the 25,000 square feet of area would be modeled with an electric heat source in the Baseline Case (System Type #4 - Packaged Single Zone Heat Pump).

Applicable Internationally.

Formal Inquiry

Table G3.1.1A lists two possible categories for the building heating source:
(1) Fossil fuel, fossil/electric hybrid, & purchased heat;
(2) Electric and other.

In cases where the proposed building design includes both a natural gas heating source and an electric heating source, when should the heat source in Table G3.1.1A be identified as "Fossil/Electric Hybrid" versus "Electric"?

Thanks for all the discussion.  I think a literal interpretation of the
code would actually define the baseline as PTAC with a hot water boiler
for heating.  The ASHRAE interpretation actually appears to be a
misinterpretation to me, but as the "misinterpretation" makes more sense
than the code, I'm going to go with it.  It is a little quirky, as the 80%
electric vrs 20% gas seems pretty arbitrary.  Can we use this on non-res
projects too?  

 

The ventilation scheme described by Mr. Riemer doesn't meet the IBC,
you're not allowed to use a corridor as a duct.  Dwelling unit or guest
room doors are supposed to be weather-stripped and make-up air is supposed
to come from the exterior through trickle vents or some other sort of
make-up opening.  This doesn't mean that many buildings aren't built that
way of course.

In the ASHRAE interpretation that Mr. Rosenberg highlighted, the
interesting thing that is missing is ventilation and exhaust. What if the
questioner had said 'exhaust fans in the guestroom toilets, no ventilation
at the PTAC, transferring air under the hallway door, outside air in
rooftop unit determined based on needed guestroom toilet make up'?  Would
that have made it a "hybrid"?  

 

I suspect the design did that and thus heated outside air at the rooftop
with natural gas.  And the interpretation let the project use the entirely
electrically heated baseline with a good portion of electric resistance
heating.  While USBGC/GBCI anticipated that (#2 in their list) and said
"hybrid".

 

It is increasingly tougher problem to avoid crediting fuel switching.  We
will all just keep doing the best we can.

Well that 90.1 Interpretation makes everything clear as mud. There is no
formal definition for "hybrid" system in the Standard, and it is only
explained in the User's manual. A "predominantly" electric-heated system
with some fossil fuel is still a hybrid. Otherwise, what is a hybrid
system?

Interesting.  That is obviously the more logical approach, however we now
have two conflicting interpretations.  The 90.1 interpretation is more
recent than the LEED CIR.  I'm not sure how one would go about challenging
an existing CIR to get it corrected.  Does anyone have any experience with
this?  

 

Also, the interpretation does not shed any light on a fossil fuel
preheat/DOAS system serving an electric heating system.  I would assume
that this system would still be classified as Fossil/Electric hybhrid and
thus compare to a fossil fuel baseline.

Maria,

 

I'd have to disagree with you.  No where in G3.1.1 exception (a) does it
say that you can ignore non-predominant conditions.  In fact, if you read
the CIR I quoted it very clearly states an example where 90% of the
building is electric heat and the other 10% is gas-heat (less than 20,000
SF) and the baseline model is determined to be Fossil/Electric Hybrid.  

 

You may be thinking of the footnote to Table G3.1.1A which states "Where
attributes make a building eligible for more than one baseline system
type, use the predominant condition to determine the system type for the
entire building."  However, the CIR is counter to this, and since Table
G3.1.1A includes a category for Fossil/Electric Hybrid, your building
would only fall into one category.

 

Vinany - the CIR addresses that exact scenario and states that gas
furnace-fired DOAS puts you into the Fossil/Electric Hybrid category and
your baseline would be System 1 PTAC with HW.

I think that in Morgan's case using PTHP baseline is also justified. From
what I understand, the project is a residential buildings with
electrically heated living units and gas-heated common spaces. Applying
G3.1.1 to the project, predominant conditions are residential with
electricity as heat source; non-predominant conditions are non-residential
with fossil fuel heat. Based on G3.1.1 exception (a), non-predominant
conditions accounting for less than 20,000 SF may be ignored when
selecting the baseline system from Table G3.1.1A, thus the baseline for
the project is PTHP. If residential units were served by WSHP, then
predominant conditions would be residential with Fossil/Electric Hybrid
heating source, and the baseline system would by PTAC.

Morgan,

 

I agree with Bill.  I find this LEED CIR (see below) to be helpful in
determining how fossil/electric hybrid systems should be handled.  Your
scenario sounds similar to item 5 under the examples of systems that would
be modeled with fossil fuel heating.

Ruling


Clarification is requested regarding when a building heat source in Table
G3.1.1A should be identified as "Fossil/Electric Hybrid" versus
"Electric". 

The ASHRAE 90.1-2007 User's Manual states that a fossil/electric hybrid
source "refers to a system with any combination of fossil and electric
heat, and the baseline system for this is a fossil fuel system".
Therefore, the heating source for the proposed building would be
considered "Fossil Fuel" or "Fossil/Electric Hybrid" if the building uses
any fossil fuel source for space heating (including backup heating or
preheating), and the baseline building heat source would be fossil fuel.

Exception: ASHRAE 90.1 Section G3.1.1 Exception (a) stipulates additional
system type(s) for non-predominant conditions (i.e.
residential/non-residential or heating source) if those conditions apply
to more than 20,000 square feet of conditioned floor area. 

EXAMPLES OF BASELINE HEATING SOURCE DETERMINATION: 

The Baseline heat source from Table G3.1.1A for the following Proposed
Case system types would be fossil fuel since the proposed system design
includes a combination of fossil and electric heat:

1. Variable air volume system with gas furnace preheat and electric reheat
2. Packaged terminal heat pumps with outside air tempered by fossil fuel
furnace
3. Water source heat pumps with fossil fuel boiler
4. Ground source heat pumps with backup fossil fuel boiler
5. 90,000 square feet is conditioned by a variable air volume system with
electric reheat, and 10,000 square feet is conditioned with fossil fuel
furnaces

The following buildings would be modeled with an additional system type
with a different Baseline heating source in accordance with Section G3.1.1
Exception (a):

1. 90,000 square feet is conditioned by a variable air volume system with
electric reheat, and 20,000 square feet is conditioned with Packaged DX
systems with fossil fuel furnaces. In this case, the 90,000 square feet of
area would be modeled with an electric heat source in the Baseline Case
(System Type #6 - Packaged VAV with Electric PFP Boxes), and the 20,000
square feet of area would be modeled with a fossil fuel heat source in the
Baseline Case (System Type #3 - Packaged Single Zone AC with fossil fuel
furnace).
2. 50,000 square feet is conditioned by water source heat pumps with a
fossil fuel boiler, and 25,000 square feet is conditioned by electric heat
pumps. In this case, the 50,000 square feet of area would be modeled with
a fossil fuel heat source in the Baseline Case (System Type #5 - Packaged
VAV with hot water reheat), and the 25,000 square feet of area would be
modeled with an electric heat source in the Baseline Case (System Type #4
- Packaged Single Zone Heat Pump).

Hello all,

Does anybody know of a way to generate hourly reports .csv files automatically (i.e. without having to hit the Hourly Reports button in the SIM Viewer)?

Thank you,

Please set ?Formatted? under System Reports as below. Then, you can find a
file named xxx_HourlyData2_01.DAT whenever you run models.

Hope it helps.

Thank you to all who responded. Just for clarification if anyone else was wondering, the answer I was looking for was that the Hourly Results data is stored in the .hsr file. Opening that in Excel using Delimited > Comma gives you the same thing as opening the Hourly Results.csv.

Thank you,
Joe
