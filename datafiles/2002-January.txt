Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Convective loop in passive solar building


Hello,
 
in order to developp a bioclimatic building in Ladakh, we are looking for
information about convective loop.
 
The building we try to design should have two storeys and one sunspace on
its south face. We already have information about convective heat transfer
inside passive solar buildings thanks to publications issued from the Los
Alamos National Laboratory. However these documents were published on 1985
and they only provide major principles and data providing from few examples.
 
Does anybody know one non numerical method to design convective loop, or a
document which could be used as a reference on this subject?
 
Thanks,
S?verin POUTREL.

Hi, Severin & other Bldg-Simmers,

By "non numerical" I assume you mean not computer-simulated?  I'd say it's
impossible to do any reasonable airflow design without some
number-crunching....

The venerable Duffie & Beckman's chapter 14 offers some guidance on "Trombe
wall" type collector design:
"Solar Energy Thermal Processes" (ISBN: 0-471-22371-9)

For more detailed aid with the calcs, and natural ventilation/cooling in
general, check out Baruch Givoni's books:
"Climate Considerations in Building and Urban Design" (ISBN: 0-471-29177-3)
"Passive and Low Energy Cooling of Buildings" (sorry, no ISBN; my copy was
lent & not returned - gnashing of teeth....)
"Man, Climate and Architecture, 2nd Edition" (ISBN: 0-85334-108-7)
Givoni has done decades of empirical research on full scale building
airflows at the University of Haifa; and developing simulation routines at
Haifa and UCLA.  *Excellent* texts, both non-numeric (in the form of clear,
simple graphics) and with the numbers/equations.

Another classic:
G. Z. Brown, et al
"Sun, Wind & Light: Architectural Design Strategies, 2nd Edition" (ISBN:
0-471-34877-5)


Be aware: at residential scales, convection-driven ("stack-effect") air
pressures are usually much smaller than wind-induced air pressures; so you
must have a *very* airtight building to ensure it operates as you intend.
Better to design for combined wind-stack airflows.


Good luck!
Ian Theaker, P.Eng.

Georgia Tech will be replacing a site built 120,000 pph watertube boiler
that was erected in 1944.  We intend to install a package boiler of
about 135,000 pph that uses low NOx burners.  In order to calculate the
Life Cycle Cost of the replacement boiler we need to estimate the
maintenance labor and materials costs.  Are there industry or government
guidelines that use a set percentage of the installation cost for
estimating these costs?  Are these cost ever estimated as a percentage
of the installation cost?

For example:
Maintenance labor and material costs equal 2% of installation cost per
year for the useful life of the boiler.

Please let me know where I might be able to obtain this information.

Dear all,

does any body know where to find simple climate data
(like temperature, precipitation, if possible sun
glazing) on specific areas of himalaya (Like Ladakh,
Spiti,Lahaul, Zanskar, Mustang, Sikkim...).
I'm interested by high altitude inhabited desert with
a lot of sun, to initialise the simulation of a solar

Thanks for your help

Steve,
Thanks for this update.
Two additional questions:
1) will the new version of DOE2.2 that models the screw chillers and the VFD chillers be incorporated into PowerDOE? (maybe a question for Jeff Hirsch)
2) are there / will there be any default curves for air-cooled screw chillers?  I have been trying to model this without much success so far.  I created my own curves, but the results don't appear to make sense.  When I created an output report, the modified values of EIR based on my curves made good sense, but the chiller kW that is being shown makes no sense at all.  I haven't finished debugging this yet, but wonder if anyone has any suggestions.


Sincerely,

Alec Stevens

  Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Screw chiller performance curves


  James Hirsch & Associates is currently implementing new chiller algorithms in DOE-2, and defaults performance curves for screw chillers will be included. 

  For both reciprocating and screw chillers, the program will use different performance curves depending on the number of compressors in the machine. The program will also model centrifugal chillers with variable-speed drives. Since some of these curves utilize new types of CURVE-FITS, they require a new version of DOE-2.2 which won't be released for another month or two.

  In the meantime, for current versions of DOE-2.2, the following models a water-cooled screw:

A screw chiller template of some sort would be most helpful.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] TRNSYS Training Course - reminder
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200201081517.AA170614pd80000107512@gard.com>

Dear Colleagues,
   This is just a reminder that although time is running out, there is 
still room for a few more participants in the TRNSYS Training Course 
scheduled for January 21-23 in Madison, Wisconsin. TRNSYS, commercially 
available since 1975, is a modular tool designed to simulate the transient 
performance of any energy system. The course will cover the following topics:

Introduction to Energy Simulations with TRNSYS
Simulating Building Energy Use with TRNSYS
Creating New Components
Creating Distributable TRNSYS Simulations with TRNSED
Performing Combined Thermal/Airflow Simulations with TRNSYS and COMIS
Using SimCad, the CAD Package for TRNSYS Building Simulations

Additionally, course participants will receive a free copy of TRNOPT, a 
tool that allows users to perform optimizations of TRNSYS input files. 
Anyone interested in more information about the course can email us or 
check out the course home page on the web at 
http://www.tess-inc.com/tess/training.htm. Please do not hesitate to 
contact us if you have any questions.

Cheers and Happy New Year,
   David
