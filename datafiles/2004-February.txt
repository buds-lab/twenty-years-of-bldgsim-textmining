Subject: [BLDG-SIM] research on the diffusion of energy simulation software in the design practice
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200402241316.AA1626359pd80000616460@gard.com>


Sorry for sending it again: this is the new right version, due to some problems with the hyperlinks to the questionnaires for engineers in the old one!!!!

(for the ones who have kindly already answered, we will provide to transfer their answers to the right version) 

http://sts.bwk.tue.nl/sim/architects.asp            for architectural designers

http://sts.bwk.tue.nl/sim/engineers.asp            for consultant engineers and researchers

 

 

 

 

Dear professional,

 

 

We are carrying out a survey on the employment of energy simulation software in the design of building systems. The research activity is made in collaboration between the Dipartimento di Energetica del Politecnico di Torino (prof. Marco Filippi) and the FAGO (Department of building physics) of the Technische Universiteit of Eindhoven (prof. Jan Hensen).

 

We kindly ask you to compile a questionnaire, mainly turned to consultant engineers, researchers and designers, sensitive to the principles of bioclimatic architecture. The aim is to understand how, in the design process, the building energy behaviour is estimated, in order to obtain its optimal energy performance. The main interest is turned to the reason why the energy simulation software is used or not during the normal design practice, what are their advantages and the obstacles that prevent their diffusion in the design and consultant engineers studios. 

 

We ask you to kindly compile the questionnaire, related to your professional interests, on Internet at the following addresses:

 

http://sts.bwk.tue.nl/sim/architects.asp   for architectural designers

http://sts.bwk.tue.nl/sim/engineers.asp   for consultant engineers and researchers

 

Below you can find a short explanation of some used terms.

 

 

Thanks for the attention, 

 

Kind regards

NOTES:

(1)   ENERGY SIMULATION:

Analysis of the energy performance of the building, dynamically using the computer science modelling and the simulation techniques. The energy calculation of thermal loads and the energy consumptions of the building are taken in consideration, in order to determine the energy behaviour of the building systems.

Creating a virtual building in which the user can specify in detail the parameters that influence the energy behaviour of the building, the energy simulation expands further the concept of performance prediction, being the obtained results as close as possible to the reality.

 

(2)   BIOCLIMATIC ARCHITECTURE 

The word "bioclimatic" wants to make a connection between the man, "bios", as the user of architecture, and the external atmosphere, the "climate", being the architecture the result of the interactions between them. 

Therefore "bioclimatic architecture" can be defined as the kind of architecture that optimizes the energy relations with the surrounding natural environment by means of its architectural design. The building adapts to the characteristics of the surrounding environment (vegetation, relieves, existing buildings, etc.) in order to obtain the greater advantage in thermal and lighting aspects, and improve its comfort conditions. 

The bioclimatic architecture therefore studies the typological solutions and the performances of the technological systems which better answer to the environmental and climatic characteristics of the site and which concur to obtain comfort conditions inside the buildings.

 

(3)   sustainable ARCHITECTURE 

According to a commonly accepted synthetic definition, it is possible to define sustainable those choices, concerning the development models, that concur to satisfy the actual needs without compromising the satisfaction of the future ones.

Therefore, the sustainable architecture tends to minimize, during its entire life cycle, the consumption of not renewable resources (employment of technologies which use renewable energy sources, environmental loads reduction, attention to the choice of building materials, building durability, eco-economic evaluation of the several phases of the building process, etc.) and the impact on the ecosystem, local and global, aiming to the protection of the human health (indoor air high quality, proper management of the project, etc.).

 

(4)   sustainable TECHNOLOGIES

Technologies that use the external climatic factors to control the indoor microclimate of the built environment, minimizing the consumption of exogenous energy.

 

(5)   ACTIVE TECHNOLOGIES

The active technologies are also called "indirect" because they operate a transformation of the energy (for example the solar collectors for water heating and the photovoltaic systems are active technologies, as they collect the solar radiation and transform it in other forms of energy). 

Between these technologies, it is possible to distinguish those that use renewable energy sources (e.g. photovoltaic panels); from those that use not renewable energy sources (e.g. national nets of distribution).

 

(6)   PASSIVE TECHNOLOGIES

In this group there are normally all the applications that use renewable energy, without any aid of engines, and distribute it by the natural phenomena of conduction, convection and radiation.

These technologies are also called "direct", because they use directly the energy, without further transformations; for instance glasshouses, wind towers, window systems, etc. are passive technologies.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200402231116.AA1643812pd80000614573@gard.com>

Dear List Serve Members,

I am a new user of eQuest. For a project we are currently modeling, we need
to define as a baseline project an ASHRAE 90.1-1999 facility.

The default baseline in eQuest version 3.4, which we just downloaded, is
California Title 24.

Is there a version of this program that has as a baseline project 90.1-1999?
If not, it looks like we can create our own, but it would just be more time
consuming. 

Alternately, is there a relatively short document that outlines the
differences between ASHRAE 90.1-1999 and Title 24?

Thanks,

Tom

FYI...the web site "eslsb5ec.tamu.edu" is running DOE-2 with parameters. Our
latest version, under development,runs with one command line...i.e., all
user inputs fit on one line of a spreadsheet, which makes it possible to
load and run 1,000s of runs. Creating this required carefully crafting an
input from scratch that tied all relevant commands to a limited set of
inputs.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200402191354.AA5451171pd80000608985@gard.com>

Does anyone out there have experience with simulating air to air heat
recovery in Doe2?
I would like to model a system with air to air heat recovery for a building
I have modeled in VisualDOE 3.1.  Is this even possible?  Or could I select
other options and tweak them  to achieve similar energy savings.

I was thinking that I might be able to select heat recovery which only
recovers sensible heat (preheat OSA) from the exhaust air.

And since heat recovery in Doe2 does not recover cool (precool OSA).

For the cooling season I was thinking of  selecting an indirect evaporative
pre cooler with return air for the indirect air stream, zero (or minimal)
fan power and inputting the efficiency that the actual air to air HX is
designed to achieve.

As I am unfamiliar with evaporative pre cooling and the effects that it may
have on the system I question the accuracy of the energy savings results
and how they would compare to air to air heat recovery.  Does this sound
like a logical tweak for Doe2?  Does anyone have any recommendations or
other similar tweaks they have made to model air to air.

Thanks.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] eQUEST summary reports
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200402181410.AA1049515pd80000607227@gard.com>

Is there a way to teach eQUEST to included chilled water meters and steam
meters in the graphical/summary reports it generates?

 

More correctly, I suppose - all meters are displayed in the single run
annual energy consumption report and the monthly utility bills report.  In
the comparison reports, only the annual utility bills by rate report shows
all meters.  There is, however, no comparison report which shows total
building energy use for all cases.  The   Most frustrating, the parametric
reports appear to be limited to electricity and natural gas (including cost
numbers).  It can be time consuming to extract the values for all meters
from the .sim files generated from each parametric run.

 

Also on the topic of the summary reports, is it possible to edit the
contents of the project/runs list appearing on the left-hand side of the
summary reports?

 

Regards,

Hello Kevin,

have you ever tried ESP-r from Prof. Joe Clark ?
See http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk/

It is shareware and is able to simulate a double
skin facade (we used it for several simulations
of a double skin facades).
In near future ESP-r capabilities of simulating
a double skin facade even will be enhanced .....

Hello All,
I would like to know if anyone has worked with IES
virtual environments
http://www.ies4d.com/content/?
If you have, can you offer a little incite into the
program and how it
compares to eQuest, Powerdoe, etc.
I was originally looking for a program that could
model a double skin fa?ade
and was easy to learn and work with. V.E. was
suggested to me since none of
the other programs could easily model that fa?ade
type. I have since then
obtained a free trial copy and am looking for
opinions. 
Regards,
Kevin Krudwig

Apologies for cross-posting ...

In 2000, an informal email group was initiated between professionals and academics working on various aspects of multiple skin technologies (active facades, double skin facades, airflow windows and facades, etc.). Forum topics included modelling and testing of various 'multiskin' systems, as well as a few 'practice-related' issues. Participants were mainly from the Netherlands, UK, US and Canada; mostly academics but several professionals from well-known facade engineering firms participated as well. Forum activity varied over time, some grad students moved to other things once their theses were submitted, new members popped in, etc. As this informal discussion group became increasingly difficult to maintain with time, a new Multiskin Yahoo Group was initiated ...

Those of you interested in multiskins are invited to join (multiskin-subscribe at yahoogroups.com). Some participants in other mailing lists have sent some interesting queries on multiskins lately and are encouraged to re-submit them in this forum ...

On the web site (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/multiskin/), you'll find a few useful bookmarks under the 'LINKS' tab - new bookmarks may be added by members. More useful to students in particular is a 'related publications list' found under the 'FILES' tab. All the references point to publications in English, yet many excellent publications have been published in Dutch, German and French. References are essentially limited to multiskin technologies - there are of course numerous indirectly-related publications out there, such as on heat transfer coefficient modelling, optics, solar energy, etc., but they have been omitted as the total number of publications would easily exceed the hundreds. If you wish to add new references, please post them! - they will be added ASAP ...

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200402111038.AA384946pd80000597019@gard.com>


Dear Friend,

I am working on an energy study for a building using eQUEST software and wondering if you can tell me how can I get the weather data file for Dhahran or Dammam City in Saudi Arabia? Also, could any one send me a sample file for energy rates that contains costs that vary with quantity to be computed, such as $0.05 for the first 5000 kWh, $0.035 for the next 10000 kWh, etc. To learn how to build these files using Building Description Language (BDL) needs time and actually my project doesn't has allot of time.

I appreciate your help

Thanks & Best Regards

 Ahmed Fraij

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200402101527.AA2732343pd80000595958@gard.com>


This information should be up on the EnergyPlus
web site soon (where we'll keep it up to date as
new tools are released):

EnergyPlus Interfaces and Utilities

A number of utilities and tools for creating, editing, and running input
files come with EnergyPlus, including IDF Editor, EP-Launch, and IFCtoIDF.
Third party tools for creating, editing, and displaying EnergyPlus input
files are also available, including DrawBDL, EzDrawPlus, TSe+, EzPlus-Parm,
A number of graphic user interfaces are also under development including
DesignBuilder and EcoTect.

EnergyPlus Utilities

EnergyPlus comes with a number of utilities to help create input files and
run simulations, including IDF Editor, EP-Launch, and IFCtoIDF.

EP-Launch
EP-Launch provides a simpler alternative for running EnergyPlus than batch
files.  EP-Launch allows the user to select the input file directly or from
a list of recent or sample files.  It also allows easy selection for
weather data files.  After the EnergyPlus run completes, EP-Launch reports
if any errors or warnings occurred.  In addition, EP-Launch acts as a file
manager for each run and can help open a text editor for any of the input
and output files, opens spreadsheet for several results files, and starts
up a viewer for the building drawing file.

IDF Editor
For users who want a simple way of creating or editing EnergyPlus input
data files (IDF), IDF Editor provides this service.  Any EnergyPlus object
may be viewed and edited using a spreadsheet-like grid.  For inputs with
several options, a list is provided.  When a numeric input has a range of
valid values, those values are displayed.  It also automatically provides a
list of object names when an object needs to be linked to another.  By
displaying all objects of the same kind next to each other in a grid, it is
easy to see how inputs are different across the building.  The IDF Editor
outputs an EnergyPlus input file with proper syntax and comments to help
the user understand the input values.  In addition, the IDF Editor converts
standard inch-pound units into SI units compatible with EnergyPlus.

Getting Building Geometry from CAD: IFCtoIDF
A utility for importing building geometry from commercial CAD tools into
EnergyPlus is bundled with the EnergyPlus package.  This utility is based
on the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) data model standard from the
International Alliance for Interoperability (IAI).  More information on
this utility can be found at (link here to existing IFCtoIDF page).  For
more information on the status and availability of IFC-compliant software
tools visit the IAI Implementation Support Group website and look under
International Overview of IFC-Implementation Activities.

Third-party EnergyPlus Tools

These tools are developed and provided through third-party vendors.
Contact the vendors for pricing and availability.

DrawBDL (www.drawbdl.com)
DrawBDL allows users to visually review the building geometry in EnergyPlus
and DOE-2 input files.  DrawBDL can export the DOE-2 surface data in
EnergyPlus IDF format?useful for those users who wish to convert their
DOE-2 input files into EnergyPlus input files.

DrawEzPlus and EzPlus-Parm (www.deringergroup.com/Software/EPlusTools.htm)
DrawEzPlus is a 3-D geometry rendering tool that displays the geometry
imbedded in an EnergyPlus file. Users can toggle between line and surface
(fill) presentation modes, and can select to draw any mix of key building
objects -- floor, walls, roof, windows, and attached and detached shading.
EzPlus-Parm simplifies running multiple parametric EnergyPlus simulations.
EzPlus-Parm helps a user to organize and edit all needed files.  Their
EcoAdvisor product also uses EnergyPlus to perform web-based building
energy simulations.

TSe+ (www.tse-inc.net/tseplus)
The first of a suite of tools to manage data for EnergyPlus is now
available free of charge from Taylor Systems Engineering.  TSe+Mat provides
an interface to the materials datasets that come bundled with EnergyPlus
and allows the user to add them to a personal database to maintain and
modify for later use.  Future tools under development include TSe+MatGlz
(for materials and glazings) and TSe+Con (for constructions).

EnergyPlus Interfaces

The first EnergyPlus user interfaces are under development.  One is
currently available in beta version while the second one produces an
EnergyPlus IDF file.

DesignBuilder ( www.designbuilder.co.uk )
Provides a range of environmental performance data such as: annual energy
consumption, maximum summertime temperatures and heating and cooling loads
as well as detailed feedback on temperatures and heat flows in the
building.  Featuring easy-to-use sketch screen, hierarchical defaults,
facades, customisable templates and data detail, DesignBuilder can be used
effectively at any stage of the design or evaluation process.
DesignBuilder provides an interface to the latest EnergyPlus version for
envelope, solar, ventilation and daylighting capabilities as well as
heating and cooling load modelling.  Users can export models created in
DesignBuilder as EnergyPlus input files. The software comes with summer and
winter design data for 1439 locations around the world and access to more
than 500 hourly simulation weather files. A fully functional beta version
has been available since April 2003.

Ecotect (www.squ1.com)
Ecotect from Square One couples an intuitive 3D design interface with a
comprehensive set of performance analysis functions (visualization, solar
and daylighting analysis, shadows and shading, lighting design, thermal
performance, UK building regulations, ventilation, and acoustic analysis)
with interactive information displays.  It also can export an EnergyPlus
IDF file.


Several other tools are under development?we will provide information as it
becomes available.

Daniel,

While you could use the TRNSYS/EES connection and/or the TESS delayed input 
controller, I would strongly recommend that you write your own component to 
model your fuzzy controller.  It's easy to add your own models to TRNSYS 
and in this way the controller does EXACTLY what you need it to do.  You 
could pass in the solar radiation, load profile, atmospheric pressure, and 
store any values you need from previous timesteps for your 
algorithm.  Refer to the source code of relevant components for hints and 
ideas on your model.

Good luck,

Jeff

David,

In eQuest, assign a schedule for the chilled water loop operation such that it is not available during the winter.  That may clear up the problem.  The chilled water loop may be providing a fixed quantity of chilled water demand just because it is on.

Hi everybody

I m trying to simulate a kind of Mall with eQUEST. I have 4 perimeter zones and a core. The HVAC system chosen is standard VAV reheat with baseboards in the perimeter zones (I m not very sure if it s suitable for the kind of building). I ve also set up an economizer. 

My question is this: I don t understand why in the output file I have a fixed quantity of chilled water demand in winter, when it s sure that the outdoor temperature is good enough to satisfy the core refrigeration load.

Can anybody explain me this?

thanks

A vane axial fan curve is now part of the DOE-2 cadre in eQuest/DOE-2.2.
Nifty.
 
Now what if I want to do a crazy thing like freeze the pitch of the vane
axial fan and put a VFD on it. Would the VFD recognize the frozen vane axial
curve, or would it become a VFD on a centrifugal fan (an incorrect
simulation of what I would want to see)?

The Institute of Energy and Sustainable Development at De Montfort
University (UK, www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk) is considering offering a new MSc
course 'Energy and Sustainable Building Design'. We are trying to gauge
interest in such a course.

The new MSc course would have a focus on sustainable approaches to
design and will have an emphasis on computer simulation techniques

Dear users,
 
Working on a solar hot water system, I have the project to manage the back-up use according to some external & evolutive conditions (solar irradiation, load profile of the last days & hours, atmospheric pressure...).
 
 A special algorithm (fuzzy logic) will be used with several equations, using values from the inputs (instantenous and older), to preventively start & stop the back up.
 
I would like to know whether a good idea is to model this controller with TRNSYS 15 using the TYPE 66 and the EES solver or to use any other way such as the "Delayed inputs controller" (taken from HVAC library (TESS)) ???
 
Thank you very much in advance for your help

	um
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200402060125.AA2520984pd80000590985@gard.com>

Dear Yu,

we have investigated several atria with glazed roof using
the well known software ESP-r from Joe Clark, ESRU
(see http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk/ fore more informations).
In comparison to TRNSYS or DOE-2 ESP-r enables thermal and
air flow simulations of much higher quality as it incorporates
a complete radiation model based upon real geometry and
using view factors for thermal radiation heat exchange.

Regarding your task I assume that it will be very difficult
to seperate the corridors from the atrium thermally; or in
other words: If you are cooling the corridors (i.e. 25 degC),
an intensive air exchange between the cooled corridors and
the (uncooled (?) and heated by solar gain) atrium will take 
place, which yields similar air temperatures in the corridor
and the atrium. Thus cooling the corridor you will also cool
the atrium.

For the simulation of such a system you have to define seperate zones
(corridors and atrium), which show heat exchange by thermal
radiation as well as convection (air flow). 
The heat exchange between the zones by thermal radiation should 
base upon the correct geometry (using view-factors); the heat
exchange between the zones by convection (air flow) requires
an air flow network (model of air nodes), which shows a flow
component with a bidirectional air flow, and which is coupled
with the thermal domain (solving zones energy balances) implicite.
ESP-r has these features; thus I can recommend it for your problem.

Regards,
Gunter

the atrium is of circular shape in the plan view and is located at the
interior of a builiding. There are corridors (air-conditioned spaces)

There is no physical separation between the corridors and the atrium except

I would like to know what is the best way to compute the cooling loads of
the corridors and atrium. The corridors may need to keep at 25 degC during

point for the atrium or whether I need to define these two types of area as
separate zones.

I would be grateful to anyone's help if he/she can provide some clues or

Hi folks,

I'm working on a study of the performance of heat-recovery wheels in 
various U.S. climates.  We will be using both eQuest and a custom 
spreadsheet using bin data.  Are any of you aware of generic plans for both 
an office building and school building upon which to base the analyses?  I 
recall that NBS (now NIST) once did this for residential but I can't put my 
finger on any other "standards."

If any of you would like to share your experiences with heat wheels, I 
invite you to reply to me with the answer to these questions.  Your 
responses will be confidential but I may use them in a future paper, with 
your anonymity:

1.  Approximately how many building projects have you worked on with heat 
recovery wheels?
2.  How many of these had an option to bypass the heat wheel to allow for 
an economizer with up to 100% outside air?
3.  Do you have any advice for applying heat wheels for best performance?

Thanks.

Mike,

I suggest looking at a recently published guideline available at the
California Energy Commission's website. The Advanced VAV System Design Guide
has quite a bit of information about supply pressure reset and even includes
some DOE2 fan curves developed to approximate the performance (see page
198). Note that the file size is about 4MB.

Although our company works with VisualDOE, this question is applicable to
DOE-2.1 in general.

If I model a VAV system with supply air temperature reset based on warmest
zone or an outside air schedule, this will at times cause the originally
satisfied VAV boxes to open further and increase fan power.

Is it possible to model static pressure reset where the static setpoint is
reduced if all boxes are satisfied?  I'd be curious to see how the cost of
fan energy and heating/cooling energy varies between the two control
strategies.

Thanks.

Dear colleagues

First of all, thanks everybody for your support. I know that sometimes I ask basic questions but I?m new in this and apart from the manuals, nobody can help me but you.

My question is this:

I don?t really understand how the thermostat in eQUEST work. What I?ve understood from the help is that when you are going to be over the cooling setpoint or down the heating one the HVAC says you need cool/hot . But for example, I?m using 4 pipe fan-coils in a residential building and even if I set the cooling setpoint to 100?F (It?s an example) The chilled water meter says to me that for some hours I need little cooling in the Winter months!!!!!!!!!!! How can it be possible? Why it?s not exactly zero?

Can anybody help me to understand how the thermostat works in order to understand my results? Are the indoor design temperatures (72-75?F) or the throttiling range (2?F)  maybe the responsible? 

Thank you

Dear list members,

Based on what I have learned from my recent Ph.D. thesis work on double-skin 
systems, please allow me to add my opinion to the discussion. 

1. Modeling  
As far as I know, there is no specific simulation tool developed for the 
system. That's part of the reasons that many researchers and scientists have 
developed so far their own simulation models which can be found in 
publications. For those who asked about the modeling, I want to mention some 
of publications within my reach as follows: 

  - Gratia, E. and Herde, A.D. (2004), Natural ventilation in a double-skin 
fa?ade, Energy and buildings, vol.36, no.2, pp.137-146
  - Gratia, E. and Herde, A.D. (2004), Optimal operation of a south double-
skin facade, Energy and buildings, vol.36, no.1 pp.41-60
  - Manz, H. (2004), Total solar energy transmittance of glass double fa?ades 
with free convection, Energy and buildings, vol.36, no.2, pp.127-136
  - Manz, H. (2003), Numerical simulation of heat transfer by natural 
convection in cavities of facade elements, Energy and buildings, vol.35, no.3, 
pp.305-311 
  - Park, C.S. (2003), Occupant Responsive Optimal Control of Smart Facade 
Systems, Ph.D. thesis, College of Architecture, Georgia Institute of 
Technology 
  - Saelens, D. (2002), Energy Performance Assessment of Single Storey 
Multiple-Skin Fa?ades, Ph.D. thesis, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven 
  - Grabe, J. (2002), A prediction tool for the temperature field of double 
facades, Energy and buildings, vol.34, no.9, pp.891-899 
  - Cho, S.H., Shin, K.S., and Zaheer-Uddin, M. (1995), The Effect of Slat 
Angle of Windows with Venetian Blinds on Heating and Cooling Loads of 
Buildings in South Korea, Energy, Vol.20, No.12, pp.1225-1236 
  - Rheault, S. and Bilgen, E. (1990), Experimental Study of Full-size 
Automated Venetian Blind Windows, Solar Energy, Vol.44, No.3, pp.157-160 
  - Rheault, S. and Bilgen, E. (1989), Heat Transfer Analysis in an Automated 
Venetian Blind Window System, Journal of Solar Energy Engineering, Vol.111, 
No.1, pp.89-95 

Some of the above models are very detailed and for instance developed with 3D 
CFD simulations, whereas others are simple and lumped. But, a higher level of 
detail is not always better and in many cases even counterproductive as the 
required level of model complexity is dependent on the user's need. In my 
thesis work, I developed a lumped model for determining optimal control (of 
louver slat angle and airflow regime in the cavity) applied in an on-line and 
real-time control system. Using full 3D CFD models for this purpose would be 
an example of "over-engineering". I found that the lumped model, calibrated 
through in-situ experiments, is surprisingly accurate, stable, and very 
adequate for optimal control and performance studies. 

2. Economic aspect of the double-skin facade systems
One chapter in my thesis discusses performance comparison of an optimally 
controlled double-skin system (System I), a static double-skin system (System 
II, louver angle and airflow regimes changed manually without any optimization 
algorithm), and a conventional double-pane window system (System III) in the 
climate of Atlanta and Chicago. For this comparative study, I developed a set 
of performance indicators in the areas of energy, visual and thermal comfort. 
It was concluded that System I is most advantageous, but much to my surprise, 
System II is not always superior to System III in terms of energy. Thus, it 
was concluded that when designing/operating a double-skin system, intelligence 
is not an option but a must if energy saving is the target. One other thing I 
would like to stress here is that the control system responds to user 
preferences and changes in weather and environmental inputs, leading to 
improvements in visual and thermal indoor comfort, the economic benefit from 
which is hard to translate in terms of dollars. 


An on-going Ph.D. thesis work at Georgia Tech conducts techno-economical 
feasibility studies on whole building scale. The study will also address the 
optimal design of the double-skin facade systems in different climates and 
constrained by characteristics of the buildings.  Please find more detailed 
information on the Georgia Tech double skin facade research group website: 
http://sfdu.arch.gatech.edu

Looking forward to sharing your experience and opinions, 

Best Regards

Go to the website
http://www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/weatherdata.html for hourly
data on a wide variety of cities.  I am a Mechanical Engineering grad
student at Virginia Tech.  Give me a call at 231-6801 if you want to come on
by and I could help you out with this.  I am doing building energy savings
analysis.

Ian

Ian,

This issue is very dependent on your asumptions for natural ventilation. If
you're seeing sensible cooling through infiltration, that would indicate the
natural ventilation has been turned off when it is beneficial. If you're
modeling the house without natural ventilation, then there will be times
when infiltration assumes that role, i.e., cooling the house with outside
air.

Joe

Ian,

You might want to look at what thermostat setpoint you are using in your
model.  If you look at TMY stats for the June-Sept. period, the average dry
bulb temperature ranges from 72.4 deg. - 76.9 deg.  If you have a setpoint
in your model of 78 deg., it's quite possible to get sensible cooling
calculated.  If you've ever lived there, the reality is that you'll probably
set the thermostat at 70-72 degrees in order to feel comfortable, run the
A/C most of the time, and be thankful that Georgia Power electric rates are
some of the cheapest in the country.

You might also look at how your bldg. mass is defined and run some hourly
reports on outside air 
drybulb temperatures nside space temperature, status of A/C system (on or
off),and compare.  You might find hours at night that are cooler than the
thermostat setpoint, but heat stored during the day might be causing your
A/C system to keep running, or if you shut off the A/C, the space temp. may
remain above setpoint.

Analyzing my summer component loads for Atlanta GA, I discover that the net
sensible effect of infiltration is negative.  In other words, infiltration
sensibly overall cools my house during the summer.  The infiltration latent
effect is as it should be, adding heat into the house.  When I view
pre-existing data on summer infiltration effects on homes the reported
effect is that it heats the house.  I am wondering if data showing sensible
cooling effect of infiltration during the summer is legitamate and that the
published summer effects of infiltration adds the latent and sensible
infiltration effects together to get a rough estimate of the overall
infiltration effect during the summer.

Thanks
Ian
