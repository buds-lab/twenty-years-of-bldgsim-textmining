Rob,
There multiple LEED manuals for multiple LEED programs.  LEED 2009 for Commercial Interiors credit EAc1.3 Optimize Energy Performance - HVAC does reference the Energy Cost Budget Method. Previous versions of LEED NC & CI have also referenced the ECB method.
I did not see if you stated which LEED version applies but that will be important.
Good luck,

The interpretation is worded for Chapter 11, which is another means to show compliance to the standard.

All,

This question pertains to a LEED energy model per the ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix
G. Occupancy sensors are required in spaces such as conference rooms and
employee lunch/break rooms per Section 9.4.1.2 and no lighting power
density credit can be taken for their use in the proposed design model.

My question is, do the baseline maximum LPDs prescribed by ASHRAE, say 1.3

adjustment for occupancy sensor use or does the credit have to be manually
applied on top of the 1.3 W/sf in the Baseline model?

Thank you,

IBPSA Seattle Chapter Brainstorming Meeting

Some of us local energy modelers are contemplating forming a Seattle area IBPSA-USA chapter. IBPSA-USA is the United States regional affiliate of the International Building Performance Simulation Association (IBPSA)<http://www.ibpsa.org/>. The mission of IBPSA-USA is to advance and promote the science of building simulation in order to improve the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of new and existing buildings in the United States. We are in contact with IBPSA national and are following their recommendations on initial organizing steps.

At this time we would like to hear from anyone interested in forming a local chapter. If there is a sufficient response, we will convene to brainstorm local topics of interest and start to shape the direction of a future local chapter. To get a count of people who are potentially interested in an IBPSA Seattle chapter, please lets us know you are interested by filling out the following one question survey: http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/SCWLQKN We have scheduled a brainstorming meeting for the evening of Friday, January 27th, 2012.  If you are interested in attending the brainstorming session, please RSVP at http://groupspaces.com/IBPSASeattle. You can also join the group at http://groupspaces.com/IBPSASeattle  We would keep you informed about upcoming events and presentations through occasional emails.

Ramana,

 

90.1-2007 Table G3.1 section 6 under Baseline Building Performance states: "
. . . No automatic lighting controls (e.g. programmable controls or
automatic controls for daylight utilitzation) shall be modeled in the
baseline building design, as the lighting schedules used are understood to
reflect the mandatory control requirements in this standard."

 

You should not be adjusting the power density number to simulate lighting
controls, but adjusting the schedules to reflect occupancy sensor operation.
For example, say there are a number of offices and conference rooms in the
proposed building that will have occupancy sensor controls.  This should be
simulated by inputting the LPD or actual connected load, and creating a
schedule with a 10% - 15% reduction for each hour of operation per Table
G3.2.  In the LEED baseline model, the schedule for the offices would be not
have the occupancy sensor reduction, but the conference room and other
spaces required by 90.1 to have occupancy sensor control would use the
reduced schedule.  Clear as mud?

Steven, see Table G3.2 of 90.1.  Ramana is correct that you can apply
reductions in connected lighting density for occupancy sensors in those
spaces that do not need them (but have them).

 

Ramana, to answer your question, the LPDs for the baseline model should
not be adjusted per Steven's quote of Table 3.1.

Reviewing Table G3.1.6.g., I see more than one right answer.  You can
revise either the installed lighting power (LPD) OR the associated
scheduling - I should think both approaches equally acceptable.  I
personally revise the LPD values.

 

This is inherently a "clear as mud" sort of topic since you need to
bounce between so many parts of 90.1 to get the full picture, so I'll
try to bullet the logic simply:

*         Prescribed LPD's from chapter 9 are representative of what
should be in the baseline.  

*         Prescribed baseline are representative of any applicable
required occ. sensors.  They should not be modified in any fashion in
the baseline model.

*         Proposed lighting LPD's as defined (using either the
space-by-space or whole building method), may apply the prescribed
reductions to the proposed installed LPD (10/15%) BUT ONLY against
fixtures in spaces containing such controls that are not otherwise
required to have them.

 

A simple example for illustration:

1.       Proposed office space and an employee lunch/break room each
have a designed LPD of 0.80

2.       Baseline model could use 1.0 W/SF for both spaces (whole
building / 90.1-2007)

3.       Since the break room is required to have an occ. sensor, the
proposed break room stays at 0.80 W/SF.

4.       Since an office space is not required to have an occ. sensor,
the proposed office space gets a reduction:  10% of 0.80 = 0.08, so the
revised LPD is 0.72 W/SF.

Hi Ramana,

 

Hope you are doing well. This is a tricky aspect of the ASHRAE90.1. But
if you are modeling for LEED, I would refer to the Advanced Energy
Modeling for LEED: Technical Manual where it explicitly says:

 

Baseline case: Do not take credit for automatic lighting controls, such
as daylight controls, occupancy controls, or programmable controls.

 

Proposed Case: Model any daylight-responsive lighting control systems in
proposed design. Also model occupant sensor lighting controls (Table
G3.1, No. 6) in spaces where they are not mandatory; note that such
controls are mandatory in

classrooms, conference rooms and employee lunch and break rooms (Section
9.4.1.2).

 

So, either I take credit for Occup. Sensors in both the cases for
conf/meeting rooms or not take it.

 

Hope this helps,

Jude.

Reviewing Table G3.1.6.g., I see more than one right answer.  You can
revise either the installed lighting power (LPD) OR the associated
scheduling - I should think both approaches equally acceptable.  I
personally revise the LPD values.

 

This is inherently a "clear as mud" sort of topic since you need to
bounce between so many parts of 90.1 to get the full picture, so I'll
try to bullet the logic simply:

*         Prescribed LPD's from chapter 9 are representative of what
should be in the baseline.  

*         Prescribed baseline are representative of any applicable
required occ. sensors.  They should not be modified in any fashion in
the baseline model.

*         Proposed lighting LPD's as defined (using either the
space-by-space or whole building method), may apply the prescribed
reductions to the proposed installed LPD (10/15%) BUT ONLY against
fixtures in spaces containing such controls that are not otherwise
required to have them.

 

A simple example for illustration:

1.       Proposed office space and an employee lunch/break room each
have a designed LPD of 0.80

2.       Baseline model could use 1.0 W/SF for both spaces (whole
building / 90.1-2007)

3.       Since the break room is required to have an occ. sensor, the
proposed break room stays at 0.80 W/SF.

4.       Since an office space is not required to have an occ. sensor,
the proposed office space gets a reduction:  10% of 0.80 = 0.08, so the
revised LPD is 0.72 W/SF.

Ramana,

 

90.1-2007 Table G3.1 section 6 under Baseline Building Performance
states: " . . . No automatic lighting controls (e.g. programmable
controls or automatic controls for daylight utilitzation) shall be
modeled in the baseline building design, as the lighting schedules used
are understood to reflect the mandatory control requirements in this
standard."

 

You should not be adjusting the power density number to simulate
lighting controls, but adjusting the schedules to reflect occupancy
sensor operation.  For example, say there are a number of offices and
conference rooms in the proposed building that will have occupancy
sensor controls.  This should be simulated by inputting the LPD or
actual connected load, and creating a schedule with a 10% - 15%
reduction for each hour of operation per Table G3.2.  In the LEED
baseline model, the schedule for the offices would be not have the
occupancy sensor reduction, but the conference room and other spaces
required by 90.1 to have occupancy sensor control would use the reduced
schedule.  Clear as mud?

All,

 

This question pertains to a LEED energy model per the ASHRAE 90.1
Appendix G. Occupancy sensors are required in spaces such as conference
rooms and employee lunch/break rooms per Section 9.4.1.2 and no lighting
power density credit can be taken for their use in the proposed design
model.

 

My question is, do the baseline maximum LPDs prescribed by ASHRAE, say
1.3 W/sf for conference rooms, already account for the power 10 or 15%
adjustment for occupancy sensor use or does the credit have to be
manually applied on top of the 1.3 W/sf in the Baseline model?

 

Thank you,

Ramana Koti.

Jim,

 

My reasoning for adjusting schedules instead of LPD or actual connected kW
is that it's more transparent for the reviewer, because:

The baseline LPDs == 90.1 required values

Proposed model LPDs or directly input kWs == what is on the drawings

 

You can then have identical "occupancy sensor" schedules in both the models
which is applied where occupancy sensors are required in the baseline
(classrooms, conference, etc), and where occupancy sensors are installed in
the proposed building model.

Out of curiosity, why do you think it matters that the schedule be adjusted
instead of the LPD? It seems that the end result will be the same.

Colleagues,
   The deadline for submitting abstracts for the IBPSA-USA SimBuild 2012 
Conference being held August 1-3, 2012 in Madison, Wisconsin is being 
extended one week until December 9, 2011. Abstracts should be submitted 
online by visiting:

***********************************************************

SimBuild 2012

5th National Conference of IBPSA-USA
August 1 - 3, 2012 -- Madison, WI

Call for Abstracts

IBPSA-USA is soliciting abstracts for its fifth biennial conference on 
building performance simulation, SimBuild 2012. Please note that 
December 1st, 2011 is the deadline for all abstracts.

The conference organizers are limiting the number of peer-reviewed oral 
presentations in order to maintain a high level of quality in the 
papers. Submissions will therefore be rigorously peer-reviewed. Paper 
submissions should deal with computer-based building performance 
simulation (BPS) with the scope ranging from individual building 
components to whole buildings and neighborhoods. Basic phenomena of 
interest include the modeling of heat and mass transfer, air movement, 
natural and electric light as well as controls and occupant behavior. 
Other suitable topics include new developments in tools for modeling and 
simulation, automated optimization during design and operations, 
stochastic modeling and data visualization, the generation of climate 
datasets and successful applications of BPS in design practice (case 
studies), incentive programs, building operations and education.

In addition to the technical papers, a limited number of 
non-peer-reviewed oral presentations will be sought in order to enable 
practitioners and researchers to address simulation-related issues such 
as: the future of BEM software; modeling controls in BEM software; use 
of simulation in real-time to support building operation; dealing with 
uncertainty in building performance simulation; validation, calibration 
and verification of simulation using real time data; model predictive 
control in buildings; use of BEM in a building system fault finding 
capacity; appropriate modeling for the different phases of a building 
design; and case studies of the application of modeling in building design.

The meeting is open to all, world-wide. Madison is located in the middle 
of the US near to Chicago and Minneapolis. The conference will be held 
at The Madison Concourse Hotel in downtown Madison.

Submission of Abstracts:

Abstracts are due by December 1st, 2011 and should be a maximum of 200 
words. Abstracts should be submitted through the SimBuild 2012 website.

Hi all,

can someone send me the publication of Weber, koschenz and Lehmann entitled
'A simplified RC-network algorithm for thermally activated building
component systems (tabs) for the use in building simulation programs', in
2005 that had been submitted for publication in applied thermal engineering

I would be a very happy person being able to read that paper ;-)

thanks already!

Dear Forum,
Feedback requested, please!  I've looked at some past posts on this general
topic and think I am asking about aspects not previously discussed..

>From previous posts and my own understanding:

.         If one or more zones is not meeting its setpoint in a given hour,
you have 1 unmet load hour.  If 500 zones all fail to meet their setpoint in
one hour, it's till one unmet load hour.

.         Add all such hours in a year to obtain your total unmet load
hours, which cannot exceed 8,760.

I am now modeling a hotel with:

.         "Massive" wall elements in the lower floors with moderate amounts
of glass, "lightweight" construction in the upper floors with a lot of glass

.         Occupancy schedules that are all over the map for Office, Assembly
/ Meeting Rooms, Kitchen & Restaurant, and Guest Rooms

.         Individual HVAC systems for almost every occupancy type.

.         Presentation to all points of the compass, especially the Guest
Tower, which is a 16-sided (roughly cylindrical) tower

This model is making my life very difficult trying to get unmet load hours
below 300!  As I think about why that is happening, it strikes me that the
combination of mass, schedules and orientations are spreading the unmet
loads around to different hours than is normal for many buildings.  Can any
of you share your thoughts about that perspective?

Thanks!

Hi james
Is it possible to relax your setpoints in proposed and baseline whilst
still meeting A55 requirements?
Would this help?

Jim,

 

I concur with your understanding of how to define unmet load hours. Your
hotel poses challenges for meeting the unmet load hours requirement, as
you described.

Unfortunately this can be a difficult problem to solve, especially in
the proposed design where the actual HVAC system design might not be
able to handle the diversity of loads.

There have been a lot of good suggestions in the forums about how to
reduce unmet hours. I have a few general suggestions (by no means an
exhaustive list).

 

*         For zones that are not controlled by a thermostat, or are only
loosely temperature-controlled by being next to a tightly-controlled
space, change to "unconditioned" or relax the thermostat setpoints as
Chris suggested.

*         Use a lower heating setpoint for spaces that are heating-only
and not kept "comfortable", like stairwells, mechanical/electrical
spaces etc.

*         Tweak the systems, especially at the zonal level - flowrates,
capacities, supply setpoints etc., while taking care not to deviate
substantially from the actual design.

*         Back off from aggressive nighttime setbacks and/or model a
warmup period in the MIN-AIR-SCH if the unmet hours are when the system
fans first come on.

*         Adjust space load amounts and schedules (occupancy, misc equip
and lighting).

*         Use air walls where appropriate to even out loads/temperatures
between zones.

 

These suggestions assume that your systems are operating in the model as
you intend, and that we're not talking about thousands of unmet hours.
Most of these suggestions need to be applied to both the baseline and
proposed models and it is easy to lose track of changes if you're not
careful.

Some people advocate increasing the throttling range in problem zones
(in both baseline and proposed models), which always works because you
are redefining what "unmet hours" are. My opinion is that this should be
done only as a last resort since you are not actually improving the
modeled system performance.

 

Regards,

Bill

Very well put, Bill!

 

To Bill's first two bullets, I'll concur and further add that there are
cases wherein a space is intentionally and rationally not designed to
achieve ordinary comfort parameters.  A clear example that springs to my
mind is auto-service garages, which I have seen commonly conditioned to
an extent, but not with the relatively tight deadbands expected inside
an office space.   In such cases, for the specific purpose of
determining unmet hours in an energy model (which itself is ultimately a
means of checking the intended performance of the system is being
modeled), it's may be entirely appropriate to revise the parameters
defining an unmet hour, or to effectively remove that space from the
tally entirely.

 

I'll simultaneously re-emphasize Bill's final point: A significant
amount of unmet hours should always be treated first as a symptom
indicating a potential problem to identify and correct within the
modeled system/building behavior.  Relaxing the parameters of what the
model is reporting for unmet hours should only be done judiciously and
on a space-by-space basis following the sort of logic we're discussing,
not liberally as a means of masking the symptom.

Jim,

 

I concur with your understanding of how to define unmet load hours. Your
hotel poses challenges for meeting the unmet load hours requirement, as
you described.

Unfortunately this can be a difficult problem to solve, especially in
the proposed design where the actual HVAC system design might not be
able to handle the diversity of loads.

There have been a lot of good suggestions in the forums about how to
reduce unmet hours. I have a few general suggestions (by no means an
exhaustive list).

 

*         For zones that are not controlled by a thermostat, or are only
loosely temperature-controlled by being next to a tightly-controlled
space, change to "unconditioned" or relax the thermostat setpoints as
Chris suggested.

*         Use a lower heating setpoint for spaces that are heating-only
and not kept "comfortable", like stairwells, mechanical/electrical
spaces etc.

*         Tweak the systems, especially at the zonal level - flowrates,
capacities, supply setpoints etc., while taking care not to deviate
substantially from the actual design.

*         Back off from aggressive nighttime setbacks and/or model a
warmup period in the MIN-AIR-SCH if the unmet hours are when the system
fans first come on.

*         Adjust space load amounts and schedules (occupancy, misc equip
and lighting).

*         Use air walls where appropriate to even out loads/temperatures
between zones.

 

These suggestions assume that your systems are operating in the model as
you intend, and that we're not talking about thousands of unmet hours.
Most of these suggestions need to be applied to both the baseline and
proposed models and it is easy to lose track of changes if you're not
careful.

Some people advocate increasing the throttling range in problem zones
(in both baseline and proposed models), which always works because you
are redefining what "unmet hours" are. My opinion is that this should be
done only as a last resort since you are not actually improving the
modeled system performance.

Thanks, Michael.

You are correct about throttling range in E+, and I have already tinkered
with the ReportingTolerance.

I am aware that there seems to be no official  definition of "reasonable",
but presumed that there was a consensus and it was reflected in the default
E+ value.

Maybe not..

Jim,

 

I think you are using E+, which does not have an input  throttling range. We
have found that loads not met are dependent on the E+ object
OutputControl:ReportingTolerances, which defaults to 0.2 deg. C ., which is
quite small. You might try increasing that to something more reasonable. 

 

Mike

Multi-Use Facility Energy Modeling: Lessons Learned

James V. Dirkes II, PE, LEED AP, BEMP

 

Multi-use facilities are everywhere.  I had never modeled one of them, but I
had modeled all of the component occupancy types, including a swimming pool;
how hard could it be? Harder than I thought; read on!  (Although I use
EnergyPlus and many of you do not, I think that some of what follows is
generic enough to apply to everyone.)

Lesson #1:  Heat Pumps are not very appropriate for certain occupancies

ASHRAE 90.1?s Baseline system selection does not care too much about the
specifics of an application.  In this case, an all-electric building in
Florida called for heat pumps (System #2 for guest rooms and System #4 for
most of the other occupancies.)   The project site in Florida meant that it
is in Climate Zone 2 and did not require an economizer control.

When you combine a heat pump with no economizer and a zone that is dominated
by internal loads, such as a ballroom or meeting room, two things happen:

?         The DX coil tries to operate during cold weather (There are lots
of internal loads that require cooling.)

?         Millions of warnings arise (200 million in this case), telling you
that your DX coil is producing sub-freezing outlet temperatures.  This is
guaranteed to win the favor and confidence of a LEED reviewer.

Without thinking this through completely, the first attempt at solving this
was to turn off the darn DX coils when the outdoor temperature was below 55F
using the EnergyPlus EMS controls.  That got rid of most of the warnings 

but the unmet load hours went up significantly.  After looking at output
variables, it became obvious: The DX coil is OFF and there?s no outdoor air
cooling assist from the economizer.  I solved 200 million warnings, but
created another problem which would not win any favor or confidence from a
reviewer.

The next attempt added an economizer for zones which were dominated by
internal loads.  Life was better, but not perfect.  I was chafing at the
fact that electricity was not being used by the DX coils to provide cooling
during cold weather, because it would reduce ?savings? compared to the
Proposed system, but could not figure out a better alternative.

Lesson #2:  EnergyPlus does not like to autosize systems with large outdoor
air loads

While autosizing is neither a new idea nor a difficult one, a wrinkle arises
for energy models that must comply with ASHRAE Standard 90.1?s Appendix G.
Because ASHRAE 90.1 requires outdoor air amounts to be identical for the
?Baseline? and ?Proposed? energy models, I specified the minimum amount of
outdoor air (to match the Proposed systems) instead of autosizing it.  

This resulted in several systems with a high outdoor air fraction (20-50% of
total flow).  With more outdoor air, the coil entering air is hotter and
more humid and requires a correspondingly large coil capacity compared to
the air flow rate.  EnergyPlus imposed its built-in flow / capacity limits
and it reduced the coil size for several zones in order to meet the limits.
Those down-sized DX coils failed to adequately cool the zones they served 

and unmet loads resulted.

I tried an assortment of tactics to convince EnergyPlus to size the coils
properly and failed rather miserably.  Increasing the sizing factor in
Sizing:Zone made some difference, but I was using 175% for some zones in
order to get noticeable improvement in unmet loads.  That meant much larger
fans and a corresponding larger energy use for the Baseline, which seemed
like cheating because it would be a false comparison to the Proposed system.

Experimentally, I told the Sizing:System object to consider those systems as
?100% outdoor air? and saw some improvement in the coil capacity.

Lesson #3:  Multiple Occupancy Start Times Breed Large Unmet Load Hours

I considered all of the occupancy schedules, HVAC system types, temperature
and humidity criteria, compass orientation and glazing when defining zones.
This facility is approximately 100,000 sq., ft. and one could have justified
50 zones; I used sixteen.  The key aspect of those 16 zones was that their
fan schedules, considering different days of the week, included nine
different starting hours.  In many buildings, it?s common and expected that
you will see an unmet load hour during the first hour of operation.  When
the entire building starts at the same time, even if several zones have
unmet loads, they all occur at the same time and result in 1 hour of unmet
load. Nine different starting times, on the other hand, opens the
possibility of an unmet load in each of those hours, for a total of 9 unmet
load hours.  This multiplication of unmet loads is, I suspect, not something
considered by the 90.1 authors.

One solution would be to make all of the schedules have uniform start times,
but I had other reasons for wanting to retain many of them (See the next
Lesson).  My thanks go out to several Bldg-Sim members, who suggested
relaxing the OutputControl:ReportingTolerances from 0.2C to something
larger.  The suggestion was based in the understanding that few HVAC systems
are expected to maintain ? 0.2C.  More commonly, ? 0.5C is perfectly
acceptable and that?s what I used for both heating and cooling.  Combined
with some sizing factor increase, unmet loads became manageable!

Lesson #4:  Hotels are not occupied 24/7

Hotels are 24/7/365 operations in many respects.  Their HVAC systems,
especially if they are PTAC or PTHP, are not operating in the occupied mode
24/7/365 if the hotel management has any clues about energy conservation.
They?re ON when the room is occupied and OFF or in a setback mode when
unoccupied.  On top of this, more sophisticated owners use a guest room
management system which controls HVAC based on room occupancy sensors and
the rental status.  My building has such a system and I wanted to represent
this in the energy comparison.

ASHRAE?s 90.1 User Manual and EnergyPlus?s Schedule dataset for a Hotel show
the fans as running 24 / 7 /365.  Occupancy, lighting and plug loads are
represented by typical sets of diversity fractions.  This approach
inherently:

?         Maintains the entire guest room area at a constant occupied
temperature (for the entire year).

?         Runs all of the fans constantly.

?         Might not account for slow seasons, during which a large fraction
of rooms may be un-rented.

?         Is very easy to model.

?         Misrepresents the actual energy consumption by what seemed an
unacceptable amount.

?         Does not allow the model to accurately represent additional
unoccupied periods made available by a guest room management system.

In order to capture something closer to the actual operation, you could
define a lot of zones and create schedules and diversity which reflect the
occupancy patterns.  This was not an attractive option for reasons of the
additional effort to create all of the zones and the additional computation
time that I anticipated would also result.

With input from the Bldg-Sim and EnergyPlus listserve communities, I elected
to continue using the reduced number of zones (16) and approach schedules in
a way that created several discrete occupied periods throughout the day,
similar to that shown in the table below.



ASHRAE?s 90.1 User Manual and its recommended schedules are equivalent to
about 210 fully occupied days per year.  The schedule above has the same
number of equivalent days, but has discrete, multi-hour periods where ?no
one is home?.  EnergyPlus treats these as unoccupied, begins cycling the fan
instead of running it constantly, and changes the temperature setpoint
accordingly.  Cooling, heating and fan energy are all reduced with greater
realism and life is good.

To model the guest room management system?s ability to do a better job of
controlling rooms, this schedule can be easily modified to add more
unoccupied hours.  Until I have a better idea, I plan to add 10% unoccupied
hours as a representation of this improved control, similar to the fraction
allowed for lighting occupancy sensors.

Lesson #5:  Outdoor swimming pools are different than indoor pools

Modeling indoor pools is a challenge, but at least there is reliable
information about how to calculate the major energy factor, evaporation.  An
outdoor pool?s evaporation rate is subject to constantly changing outdoor
temperature and humidity, as well as variable wind speed.  None of these is
true for an indoor pool and it does not appear that anyone has documented
their process for modeling energy consumption of an outdoor pool.  Little
did I know
.

Starting with a spreadsheet which calculates evaporation rates for indoor
pools using the Shah method, the TMY weather data, and adding spreadsheet
psychrometric functions from NREL, I calculated evaporation for every hour
of the year.  

Then I created a Schedule:File which shows the evaporation as a fraction of
maximum.  That Schedule is applied to the flow rate for a WaterHeater with a
fixed temperature rise and results in energy for pool heating.  At least it
results in something defensible; more work is needed.

This approach does not account for the effect of wind, but pools are
generally somewhat sheltered and I don?t yet have a method for adding wind?s
impact.  The pool also loses heat to the ground.  I have not addressed that
part yet.

Lesson #6:  My fellow energy modelers contribute substantial wisdom to this
growing industry


 and I am very grateful to them for sharing their wisdom and insights.  1+1
= 10 in this case!  This is not a finished work, but if I waited until it
was, you?d probably never see it.  So, I am posting it in hopes that some of
you benefit from my experience. You might also see a better way to approach
these problems than I did.  Admittedly, it?s an intertwined mess of factors
and I may have lost sight of important aspects as I scrambled to figure out
what was happening and how to fix it.  Comments always welcome!

But as per ASHRAE 90.1, the 300hours of unmet is w.r.t. a simulation for 8760 hours. If the building is only 8 hours working 5 days a week, then the fan on hours vary. Will the same 300 hours hold good for 3500 hours of operation also.

The maximum percentage of Unmet for 8760 hours of operation is 3.4% amounting to 300 hours. Do we have to take 3.4% of the total fan on hours to calculate maximum unmet hours if the fan on hours is anything other than 8760?

Rathna,

 

The simulation covers 8760 hours, but this does not imply 8760 hours of
fan operation. I don't see anything in Appendix G that requires you to
prorate the 300 unmet load hours based on the schedules of building
operation. So, just stick with the 300 hour threshold.

 

I suggest you follow your four-step procedure (in eQUEST or other
DOE-2), except that I've never had unmet plant loads so I'm not sure how
I would take that into account. I disagree with Ashu - adding up all the
unmet hours in all SS-R reports can double-count (or more) coincident
unmet hours.

Bill

Unmet hours for occupied hours only has been discussed but there was no good consensus on exactly how to do this. So, yes, unmet hours are of the entire (8,760) simulation and are building level, meaning one zone or all zones unmet that hour is still just one unmet hour.

Trane CDS has a good document for combating unmet hours in TRACE 700. I think it's probably generic enough to be used for any tool.

Rathna,

The simulation covers 8760 hours, but this does not imply 8760 hours of fan operation. I don't see anything in Appendix G that requires you to prorate the 300 unmet load hours based on the schedules of building operation. So, just stick with the 300 hour threshold.

I suggest you follow your four-step procedure (in eQUEST or other DOE-2), except that I've never had unmet plant loads so I'm not sure how I would take that into account. I disagree with Ashu - adding up all the unmet hours in all SS-R reports can double-count (or more) coincident unmet hours.

Regards,
Bill

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Number of unmet hours

Dear All,

The following is the procedure i use to calculate unmet hours:

1)    Percentage of Plant and system unmet is got from BEPU report.

2)    The number of hours fan is on is got from SS-E report.

3)    Percentage of system unmet(BEPU) multiplied by number of fan on hours(SS-E) gives the Unmet hours.

4)    Plant and system unmet together should not exceed 300 hours.

But as per ASHRAE 90.1, the 300hours of unmet is w.r.t. a simulation for 8760 hours. If the building is only 8 hours working 5 days a week, then the fan on hours vary. Will the same 300 hours hold good for 3500 hours of operation also.

The maximum percentage of Unmet for 8760 hours of operation is 3.4% amounting to 300 hours. Do we have to take 3.4% of the total fan on hours to calculate maximum unmet hours if the fan on hours is anything other than 8760?

Please help.

Rathnashree

Rathnashree and others,

 

I can further nail down the eQuest-specific procedural queries.

 

Summing the zone-level unmet hour reports (SS-R) can result in
"double-counting."  I personally started out doing exactly that, but
eventually learned better =).

 

For the record, SS-R reports remain very useful for identifying &
isolating the spaces/systems involved in a high-unmet hour situation.
It's also worth noting the same totals for each zone & system are much
more easily reviewed under the 'Summary' tab under 'Air-side HVAC'
following a simulation.

 

Some discussion on the topic in the archives may be misleading for those
using eQuest version 3.64 and onwards.   We used to follow a specific
"hunt and peck" procedure to correctly determine the number of unmet
hours using the "hours fans on" output in report SS-E.  Users of 3.64
onwards can enjoy a much more simplified approach:  Look to the summary
BEPS report!  

 

Here is an excerpt from the BEPS report of a dummy file I have handy:

 

TOTAL SITE ENERGY       988.49 MBTU     39.5 KBTU/SQFT-YR GROSS-AREA
39.5 KBTU/SQFT-YR NET-AREA

TOTAL SOURCE ENERGY    2860.57 MBTU    114.4 KBTU/SQFT-YR GROSS-AREA
114.4 KBTU/SQFT-YR NET-AREA

 

PERCENT OF HOURS ANY SYSTEM ZONE OUTSIDE OF THROTTLING RANGE = 15.68

PERCENT OF HOURS ANY PLANT LOAD NOT SATISFIED                =  0.00

HOURS ANY ZONE ABOVE COOLING THROTTLING RANGE                =     6

HOURS ANY ZONE BELOW HEATING THROTTLING RANGE                =   427

 

Here, you can clearly see the model has a total of 6 unmet cooling hours
and 427 unmet heating hours.  Those are what some of us on the list have
coined "coincidental unmet hours," so that's to say there is no
double-counting involved.  If this were the results of a model following
90.1 appendix G, one would need to identify and correct problems in the
model and/or system design to reduce that 427 figure to an acceptable
level.

 

Hope that helps clarify!

 

~Nick

Thanks everyone for the inputs.

Currently i am working on the visual Doe software and this does not generate SS-R report. Therefore, i will have to rely on my 4 step procedure.

With regards to plant unmet hours, the total number of unmet hours is got in PS-D (Plant load satisfied) report. I can add this with system unmet to arrive at the total unmet hours.

Regards,
Rathnashree

Dear Jan,

I hope you are fine.

In Turkey the demand to green building certificate and energy modelling is increasing. As being the only team which is expert on building simulations, sometimes we are having difficulty to meet this demand. So we are looking for a mechanical engineer who is espacially expert on energy modelling through Design Builder. We will employ him/her in our ITU Technocity R&D company, EKOMIM (www.ekomim.com<http://www.ekomim.com>). If you know any person who is willing to work in Istanbul could you please direct that person to us. We would also like to collaborate with you on this subject.

Thank you in advance.
With my best regards,
Zerrin

***********************************************************

SimBuild 2012

5th National Conference of IBPSA-USA
August 1 - 3, 2012 -- Madison, WI

Call for Abstracts

IBPSA-USA is soliciting abstracts for its fifth biennial conference on 
building performance simulation, SimBuild 2012. Please note that 
December 1st, 2011 is the deadline for all abstracts.

The conference organizers are limiting the number of peer-reviewed oral 
presentations in order to maintain a high level of quality in the 
papers. Submissions will therefore be rigorously peer-reviewed. Paper 
submissions should deal with computer-based building performance 
simulation (BPS) with the scope ranging from individual building 
components to whole buildings and neighborhoods. Basic phenomena of 
interest include the modeling of heat and mass transfer, air movement, 
natural and electric light as well as controls and occupant behavior. 
Other suitable topics include new developments in tools for modeling and 
simulation, automated optimization during design and operations, 
stochastic modeling and data visualization, the generation of climate 
datasets and successful applications of BPS in design practice (case 
studies), incentive programs, building operations and education.

In addition to the technical papers, a limited number of 
non-peer-reviewed oral presentations will be sought in order to enable 
practitioners and researchers to address simulation-related issues such 
as: the future of BEM software; modeling controls in BEM software; use 
of simulation in real-time to support building operation; dealing with 
uncertainty in building performance simulation; validation, calibration 
and verification of simulation using real time data; model predictive 
control in buildings; use of BEM in a building system fault finding 
capacity; appropriate modeling for the different phases of a building 
design; and case studies of the application of modeling in building design.

The meeting is open to all, world-wide. Madison is located in the middle 
of the US near to Chicago and Minneapolis. The conference will be held 
at The Madison Concourse Hotel in downtown Madison.

Submission of Abstracts:

Abstracts are due by December 1st, 2011 and should be a maximum of 200 
words. Abstracts should be submitted through the SimBuild 2012 website.

Colleagues,
   The deadline for submitting abstracts for the IBPSA-USA SimBuild 2012 
Conference being held August 1-3, 2012 in Madison, Wisconsin is today 
Friday, December 9, 2011. Abstracts should be submitted online by visiting:

***********************************************************

SimBuild 2012

5th National Conference of IBPSA-USA
August 1 - 3, 2012 -- Madison, WI

Call for Abstracts

IBPSA-USA is soliciting abstracts for its fifth biennial conference on 
building performance simulation, SimBuild 2012. Please note that 
December 1st, 2011 is the deadline for all abstracts.

The conference organizers are limiting the number of peer-reviewed oral 
presentations in order to maintain a high level of quality in the 
papers. Submissions will therefore be rigorously peer-reviewed. Paper 
submissions should deal with computer-based building performance 
simulation (BPS) with the scope ranging from individual building 
components to whole buildings and neighborhoods. Basic phenomena of 
interest include the modeling of heat and mass transfer, air movement, 
natural and electric light as well as controls and occupant behavior. 
Other suitable topics include new developments in tools for modeling and 
simulation, automated optimization during design and operations, 
stochastic modeling and data visualization, the generation of climate 
datasets and successful applications of BPS in design practice (case 
studies), incentive programs, building operations and education.

In addition to the technical papers, a limited number of 
non-peer-reviewed oral presentations will be sought in order to enable 
practitioners and researchers to address simulation-related issues such 
as: the future of BEM software; modeling controls in BEM software; use 
of simulation in real-time to support building operation; dealing with 
uncertainty in building performance simulation; validation, calibration 
and verification of simulation using real time data; model predictive 
control in buildings; use of BEM in a building system fault finding 
capacity; appropriate modeling for the different phases of a building 
design; and case studies of the application of modeling in building design.

The meeting is open to all, world-wide. Madison is located in the middle 
of the US near to Chicago and Minneapolis. The conference will be held 
at The Madison Concourse Hotel in downtown Madison.

Submission of Abstracts:

Abstracts are due by December 1st, 2011 and should be a maximum of 200 
words. Abstracts should be submitted through the SimBuild 2012 website. 
Please check back to the conference website for submission details at 
www.ibpsa.us/simbuild2012

Message-ID: <530d642e.46be.13432258ecb.Coremail.e2fye2@163.com>

Dear all,
According to the Table G3.1.3.7 of the ASHRAE90.1, the number and type of chillers could be determined. But I encountered a project of a industry factory, in which the industry process need a lot of cooling. I notice the Table G3.1.3.7 is for "Building Peak Cooling Load", I take it as the industry cooling will not be included in the Building Peak Cooling Load, is it correct? If so, is there any efficiency, number or type requirement of the industry chiller? Can I exclude the industry cooling energy in the building energy simulation?
Thanks!

Process cooling loads need to be modeled with a separate chiller in the baseline and modeled with the same size, number, and efficiency as the process cooling chiller. If, however, an exceptional calculation is pursued then the proposed is modeled as designed and the baseline as that which is standard practice, thus providing an opportunity to take credit for a more efficient chiller than what is standard practice. Same approach applies to the process cooling loads themselves (i.e. you can take credit for more efficient utilization of process loads and efficiency of rejecting the process heat). I would recommend searching LEED Interpretations & Addenda Database for the official ruling on similar approaches so that you can learn what LEED is looking for as justification of documenting the basis for standard practice. https://www.usgbc.org/leedinterpretations/LILanding.aspx

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Fan Power and EER
Message-ID: <4EE773AD.5080303@wichert.org>

Back about four years ago:
http://lists.onebuilding.org/pipermail/bldg-sim-onebuilding.org/2007-October/005973.html

There was  a long discussion of COP and EIR and fan power and many 
interesting points were made by many knowledgeable engineers and 
modelers on this list.  I learned a lot from this discussion, but now I 
have started using EnergyPro and the topic has reared its ugly head 
again for me.  If anybody wants to stir the old coals of that 
discussion, or point me to the definitive post on the topic, I'd be 
pleased to hear from you.  Brandon Nichols and Xiaobing Liu were 
especially helpful before.  Gentlemen, if you are still on this list, 
I'd love to hear from you.

Here goes:
EnergyPro asks for fan horsepower for the AC unit.  I have been entering 
the nominal horsepower and getting out-of-compliance results (fan power 
too high).  I have also computed actual horsepower using FLA and 
Voltage, but that doesn't drop it much at all.  When I put FLA x Voltage 
horsepower in, it's still out-of-compliance with CA T-24 CEC.

I reviewed ANSI/AHRI Standard 340/360-2007, which is the EER rating 
standard, and it says:
6.1.3.2 Indoor-Coil Airflow Rate. All Standard Ratings shall be 
determined at an indoor-coil airflow rate
as outlined below. All airflow rates shall be expressed in terms of 
Standard Air.
a. Equipment with indoor fans intended for use with field installed duct 
systems shall be rated at the
indoor-coil airflow rate (not to exceed 37.5 SCFM per 1000 Btu/h [0.06 
m3/s per 1000 W] of rated
capacity) delivered when operating against the minimum external 
resistance specified in Table 5 or at a
lower indoor-coil airflow rate if so specified by the manufacturer.

And then Table 5 says "0.75 in. H2O" for my size unit (25 tons).

So, I conclude from this that if I design the duct work to have NOT MORE 
THAN 0.75 in. H2O pressure drop to the supply register I can omit the 
fan power.  IS THIS CORRECT?

OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS:
1)    Is a rooftop unit "Equipment with indoor fans intended for use 
with field installed duct systems".
2)    If I did design for more than 0.75 in. H2O, how would I compute 
the extra horsepower?
3)    Or is this fan horsepower just for auxiliary fans, not associated 
with the equipment?


Sorry about the deja vu of this, but it's something I have to get a grip 
on today....

Cheers!

Dear colleagues,

This is a short note that I will be moving with parts of my group from Harvard to the Building Technology Program at MIT starting January 2012. We will be expanding our research focus to the awakening field of urban energy modeling, working on a coherent theory and toolset for architects, urban planners and policymakers. We have started this process last term in a class in which we developed a new Rhino based tool that calculates operational energy use for multiple buildings using E+ as well as walkscore and urban daylight availability distributions. I will be soon be sharing more information with this group.

There is a lot of exciting work to be done so, if you know any creative minds interested in doing graduate work at the interface between design and building science, please make them aware of our program.

Warm regards and season's greetings,

Christoph

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Are the eQUEST complience analysis and LEED export
	features trustworthy
Message-ID: <CAC92OQVNbpLsiPyKsy2=4AD7Yu_hCYm=vhxnhK=8DyjBHjO+sw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
This is my first post to the {SIM} thread, so please forgive any repetition
from previous posts that I may be unaware of.
I have a LEED compliance modeling job I am working on and have attempted to
use the "Compliance analysis" tool in eQUEST.
The results where at first encouraging, as it created the building
rotations as expected, but upon further analysis I lowered the that the
baseline buildings that should be at ASHRAE 2007 where using about 30% more
energy then a  building that has zero insulation, standard lighting
watts/sqft, standard hot water use, standard process loads etc... The
building that is not at code energy costs are in the sixty thousand range,
and the 0,90,180,270 average that should be at code is in
the ninety thousand range. This %30 savings for the building that has zero
insulation over the building that has been auto generated to be complaint
with ASHRAE/LEED shows that for some reason the building that is not at
code uses 30% less then the building that is suppose to be at code, and I
am sure that the software is wrong.
So I decided to not use the compliance analysis tool, in favor of creating
my proposed building in the D&D wizard, then making a copy that I then
specified ASHRAE compliance manually, and then copying my manually created
compliant building for each rotation. Then figuring that the "Export LEED
Results CSV" would be a simple way to average my manually created rotations
and compare them to my proposed building.
I made a google spreadsheet that I can copy/paste the Export LEED Results
CSV to for graphing of results.
This worked great at first, until I updated my proposed building with the
latest from the design team. Now when I Export LEED Results CSV it is
outputting zero costs for all of the buildings! The view simulation results
show costs, and the Export LEED Results CSV shows kWh usage, therms use,
and costs for Natural Gas, but leaves all of the costs of electric at ZERO,
also the feature in the Export LEED Results CSV there is a percentage cost
savings that produces results that are obviously out of whack. The first

Folks:

A quick survey:

Are people using the NRFC standard rating conditions (including standard window unit sizes per http://www.nfrc.org/documents/1997_NFRC100.pdf Table 1 p15) for assembly u-factors for windows in the Proposed Case?

I know the ASHRAE 5.8.2.4 references the NRFC 100 test, but I'm debating whether I should request custom calculations for my project's windows at their actual size, or accept manufacturer's standard literature based on the NRFC 100 rating sizes.

I know I can explicitly define the frame and glazing, which I prefer to do, but sometimes it isn't an option.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Does anyone have any experience eQUEST complience
 analysis and LEED export features?
Message-ID: <CAC92OQWdFH8N1t32LMxVUVBKhufYoj88b7fTgG8PtezWjJHQKQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
This is my first post to the {SIM} thread, so please forgive any repetition
from previous posts that I may be unaware of.

I have a LEED compliance modeling job I am working on and have attempted to
use the "Compliance analysis" tool in eQUEST.
The results where at first encouraging, as it created the building
rotations as expected, but upon further analysis I realized that the
baseline buildings that should be at ASHRAE 2007 where using about 30% more
energy then a building with has zero insulation, standard lighting
watts/sqft, standard hot water use, standard process loads etc...

The test building that is not at code energy costs are in the sixty
thousand range, and the 0,90,180,270 average that should be at code is in
the ninety thousand range. This %30 savings for the building that has zero
insulation over the building that has been auto generated to be complaint
with ASHRAE/LEED can not be correct.

So I decided to not use the compliance analysis tool, in favor of creating
my proposed building in the D&D wizard, then making a copy that I then
specified ASHRAE compliance manually, and then copying my manually created
compliant building for each rotation. Figuring that the "Export LEED
Results CSV" would be a simple way to average my manually created rotations
and compare them to my proposed building I used this feature. This worked
great at first, until I updated my proposed building with the latest from
the design team. Now when I Export LEED Results CSV it is outputting zero
electrical costs for all of the buildings! The view simulation results show
costs, and the Export LEED Results CSV shows kWh usage, therms use, and
costs for Natural Gas, but leaves all of the costs of electric at ZERO,
also the feature in the Export LEED Results CSV there is a percentage cost
savings that produces results that are obviously out of whack. The first
run I only had the percentage cost savings issue and figured I could work
around the one bug, but now that it is saying that electricity is "free" I
am very concerned with the accuracy of any of the LEED compliance tools in
eQUEST. I made a google spreadsheet that I can copy/paste the Export LEED
Results CSV to for graphing of results.

Here is the link to my google spreadsheet with the results.
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AkGqvJNjrYpldF9iTFlqb1F0dV9nRlpwSDJHbnBpcEE

I have read the PDF published on the subject, and am very curios if the
compliance analysis tool is something that is known to work correctly? (I

Aaron, 

 

It seems like the reviewers are just looking for SOME documentation of how
you established the U-Values for glazing. This is a LEED reviewer comment
from a recent project I was working on. Note that this was a LEED-NC v2.2
job, hence the reference to ASHRAE 90.1-2004:

 

"Please provide additional information to confirm that the framed assembly
U-value was used for the Proposed Case windows (e.g. showing that the
whole window assembly has been tested by NFRC, or verifying that LBNL
Window5 calculations have been provided for the whole assembly, or
verifying that the frame effects are captured within the energy modeling
software), or revise the model referencing ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Table A8.2 if
needed."

 

For this particular project, there was no NFRC or Window5 data available,
so we responded by giving them results both for the case where we entered
the center-of-glass U-value and defined the frame effect in eQUEST, and
then also the results for using the terrible default window assembly
U-values from 90.1 Appendix A. It made about a 5% swing in the energy
consumption, so obviously we hope they COG + frame effect results.

WINDOW5/6 is pretty easy to learn if you understand window systems.  
This is the same tool NFRC raters use - you can use it to get whole 
window U-factor and SHGC if you're not able to model the glass & frame 
explicitly in the whole building simulation tool you're using.  Also, 
modeling the actual window size in WINDOW is more accurate than assuming 
NFRC standard sizes, and is often a significant difference.
It'll take you 15 minutes after you get the hang of it.

i'm currently looking at the requirements for modeling a building to 
demonstrate energy savings per the epact 2005/irs 179d requirements & am 
trying to determine the proper method for calculating baseline fan 
power.  has anyone else done this yet?

per the NREL manual, Appendix G Section, Wording Changes and 
Corresponding Sections in Standard 90.1-2001:

"G3.1.2.9 Supply Fan Power:  The Reference Building model fan power 
shall be determined based on ? 6.3.3.1 in Standard 90.1-2001"

in 90.1-2001 section 6.6.3.1 is the section with the table that lists 
how to calculate the allowable system fan power.

my question is, "for epact 2005/irs 179d energy modeling is the correct 
supply fan power to use in the baseline building the same as the 
allowable fan system power?"  this seems odd when comparing it to 
90.1-2004 and having to calculate a baseline fan power (table g3.1.2.9) 
in lieu of using the fan power limitation (6.5.3.1) and plugging that 
number into the equation Pfan listed in section g.3.1.29.  it sort of 
just seems too easy.

patrick

Patrick,
For your fan power calc you may be able to use
http://energy-models.com/tools/leed-fan-calculator
Also the LEED tutorial provides good insight as to ASHRAE interpretation.

Patrick,
I found the NREL guidelines.  Here's my interpretation.  The guideline states EPAct 2005 specifies the use of 90.1-2001, but Appendix G was developed to work with 90.1-2004.  As a side note, didn't 90.1-2001 first get published without an Appendix G?  I have Appendix G has Addendum e to 90.1-2001.

Back to NREL.  Table 7 modifies 90.1-2004 so it is the equivalent to 90.1-2001.  It seems there is no option but to use the formula in Chapter 6.  When 90.1-2001 was first published there was no baseline fan power (table g3.1.2.9).  So does Chapter 6 help or hurt the energy savings?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] irs 179d guidelines

i'm currently looking at the requirements for modeling a building to demonstrate energy savings per the epact 2005/irs 179d requirements & am trying to determine the proper method for calculating baseline fan power.  has anyone else done this yet?

per the NREL manual, Appendix G Section, Wording Changes and Corresponding Sections in Standard 90.1-2001:

"G3.1.2.9 Supply Fan Power:  The Reference Building model fan power shall be determined based on ? 6.3.3.1 in Standard 90.1-2001"

in 90.1-2001 section 6.6.3.1 is the section with the table that lists how to calculate the allowable system fan power.

my question is, "for epact 2005/irs 179d energy modeling is the correct supply fan power to use in the baseline building the same as the allowable fan system power?"  this seems odd when comparing it to
90.1-2004 and having to calculate a baseline fan power (table g3.1.2.9) in lieu of using the fan power limitation (6.5.3.1) and plugging that number into the equation Pfan listed in section g.3.1.29.  it sort of just seems too easy.

regards,
patrick

Message-ID: <CAP9LdPOfB4FxZz4KOVFwkut6cTYmXoE-kFepAgmfx9FMo_CoVg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone

I began to learn TRNSYS a couple of days ago and I came across some
questions right now. I wonder if somebody happens to know TRNSYS well.The
questions are:
1. When Editing type 56, in the Ventilation lable, the Heating and Cooling
option can be set up by defining airchange rate and temperature & RH of air
flow; while in both the Cooling lable and Heating lable, the cooling and
heating option can be set up by defining cooling / heating power (does that
mean I need to estimate the cooling / heating load before set this block
up?), and the setpoint temperature & RH. As a result, type 56 provides two
methods to define HVAC system. Do I need to set up both the labes to get it
work?.

2. In addition to adding the information of HVAC in type 56, do I need to
creat the HVAC system in to get the information of energy consumption of
HVAC system?

Thanks!

Here's a brain puzzler for the list.

I'm assisting a team designing an addition (auditorium + rehearsal space) to an existing high school in Connecticut. As a public project receiving state funding, CT's High Performance Building Standard applies which requires a 21% energy cost savings (LEED for Schools Silver is also targeted for the new addition only).

The new space will have independent/new ventilation systems, but will most likely utilize the boiler and potentially chillers of the existing school building.

Buried in ASHRAE modeling guidelines, we discovered (long after project started and engineers "completed" the model) that  additions and alterations that share HVAC systems with existing spaces, are required to include those spaces in their energy model. The new space is designed for a 24% reduction - but if the existing spaces (approx. 3x the sf of new space) are included performance will fall way below the required threshold.

We can't understand how other  LEED projects in similar situations ever meet energy reduction requirements, has anyone dealt with this on a LEED project and found ways to circumvent? Has anyone come across a similar condition, and if so - how did you approach it?


Many Thanks in advance -

Hi Jeremiah,

 

To respond to your final query first:  It's my understanding the LEED
Compliance Analysis portion of eQuest is still very much a work in
progress.  I've dabbled with these new features enough to decide that,
for myself, it is presently more time-efficient to craft my baseline
models and assemble performance reports "manually."  I optimistically
look forward to future improvements, but caution anyone intending to use
these features under a deadline to first be comfortable performing the
performance rating method without such automated assistance.  You need
that experience/knowledge to effectively review and understand what
is/isn't being automated.  

 

That said, eQuest remains far and away my tool of choice for the
performance rating method - just not with the present compliance
automation.

 

>From your description I'm compelled to point out that when creating a
baseline model, you do not need to create or maintain separate copies
for each rotation.  Look into parametric runs in the archives and you'll
learn these 4 orientations can be defined and simulated within a single
project.  Much easier to manage, revise and document.

 

If I'm not mistaken, most (if not all) of what's tallied in the LEED csv
generator feature is accessible between the graphical reports for
monthly consumptions, the graphical report for annual utility costs, and
the front-end BEMP report when you look at the SIM output reports.  What
I submit for LEED documentation varies somewhat on a project-by-project
basis, but I always include those specific items.  If you're having
trouble finding anything else specifically, I would first check the
archives and otherwise feel free to ask here - though you might find a
quicker response inside the [equest-users] list ;).

 

In summary, I'd take anything produced by the LEED compliance analysis
tool and the associated CSV generator with a grain of salt.  One could
only speculate on a number of issues in the models that may have caused
the initial odd behavior where an uninsulated building beat out a
baseline-compliant building.  If it were my project, I'd likely start by
investigating whether the models are on even footing (same weather file,
qty of conditioned spaces, etc) and then ensuring neither model is
showing signs of dysfunctional systems (i.e. inordinate unmet hours),
but again I probably wouldn't rely on the baseline generator to start.

 

It sounds like you may still be struggling with "free" electricity.
First verify it isn't just the CSV feature acting wonky by checking
whether your model is in fact utilizing the utility rates you input
(check the graphical cost reports).  If you are seeing "free"
electricity there, I'd move on to check between your models to see
whether your utility rates are defined differently (or not at all) in
the "utility & economics" tree.  

 

Best of luck!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Does anyone have any experience eQUEST complience
analysis and LEED export features?

 

Hello, 

This is my first post to the {SIM} thread, so please forgive any
repetition from previous posts that I may be unaware of.

 

I have a LEED compliance modeling job I am working on and have attempted
to use the "Compliance analysis" tool in eQUEST.

The results where at first encouraging, as it created the building
rotations as expected, but upon further analysis I realized that the
baseline buildings that should be at ASHRAE 2007 where using about 30%
more energy then a building with has zero insulation, standard lighting
watts/sqft, standard hot water use, standard process loads etc... 

 

The test building that is not at code energy costs are in the sixty
thousand range, and the 0,90,180,270 average that should be at code is
in the ninety thousand range. This %30 savings for the building that has
zero insulation over the building that has been auto generated to be
complaint with ASHRAE/LEED can not be correct. 

 

So I decided to not use the compliance analysis tool, in favor of
creating my proposed building in the D&D wizard, then making a copy that
I then specified ASHRAE compliance manually, and then copying my
manually created compliant building for each rotation. Figuring that the
"Export LEED Results CSV" would be a simple way to average my manually
created rotations and compare them to my proposed building I used this
feature. This worked great at first, until I updated my proposed
building with the latest from the design team. Now when I Export LEED
Results CSV it is outputting zero electrical costs for all of the
buildings! The view simulation results show costs, and the Export LEED
Results CSV shows kWh usage, therms use, and costs for Natural Gas, but
leaves all of the costs of electric at ZERO, also the feature in the
Export LEED Results CSV there is a percentage cost savings that produces
results that are obviously out of whack. The first run I only had the
percentage cost savings issue and figured I could work around the one
bug, but now that it is saying that electricity is "free" I am very
concerned with the accuracy of any of the LEED compliance tools in
eQUEST. I made a google spreadsheet that I can copy/paste the Export
LEED Results CSV to for graphing of results. 

 

Here is the link to my google spreadsheet with the results. 

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AkGqvJNjrYpldF9iTFlqb1F0dV9
nRlpwSDJHbnBpcEE

 

I have read the PDF published on the subject, and am very curios if the
compliance analysis tool is something that is known to work correctly?
(I would be happy to find out I made some error, but can not find any
such errors on my part) 

If anyone has any insight it would be greatly appreciated.

Chou,
   In Type56/TRNBuild the term "VENTILATION" just means a flow of air 
whether it is hot, cold, or neutral. It isn't necessarily tied in any 
way to the HVAC system. The "HEATING" and "COOLING" types are used to 
calculate sensible loads for the space. Those types don't have anything 
to do with how that energy is delivered to the space.

   Typically, there are two kinds of simulations that I do with Type56:

Early on in a project, I need to determine the peak heating and cooling 
loads for the space and I need to get a very basic idea of how much 
energy the building will consume over the year. In order to do this, I 
use VENTILATION types to put the outdoor (fresh) air requirements into 
the zone. and I use HEATING and COOLING types to define set points. I 
allow the "system" to have unlimited power because all I really care 
about is the maximum hourly value and the annual sum. The annual sum 
gives a very rough idea of how much energy is required by the building. 
You have to do one of two things in order to get how much energy is 
required by the HVAC system: either define a simple COP for the heating 
and cooling system or use other TRNSYS models that take heating and 
cooling load as an input and return the power consumed (note, there are 
very few of these components)

The second kind of simulation is much more common in TRNSYS. In this, 
you use the VENTILATION type to deliver hot or cold air to the space and 
you use a thermostat model (such as Type108) to turn on and off 
equipment that controls the flow of air. In this case, you disable the 
HEATING and COOLING types because you don't care about loads. The 
equipment of the system (fans, pumps, heat pumps, furnaces, chillers, 
etc.) will compute their source energy requirements as a function of 
their inlet conditions and the building will simply react to the 
ventilation air that it receives.

Kind regards,
  David

Hey Vik,

 

Sounds something like a rock and a hard place, but then I've never
pursued LEED for only an addition.  It's my hope someone who has can
chime in with a tested position/approach.  I'm unfamiliar with the CT
standards but it seems worth nailing down whether they share the same
interpretations as well.  

 

I can offer a few scenarios/suggestions that may help work around the
situation instead of through it in any case:

 

*         If your target is to achieve LEED certification for the
addition only... I've seen auditorium and periphery spaces in large
schools effectively conditioned with their own independent packaged
systems... any chance that might be considered for the design?  If so
that might conveniently avoid the issue entirely, by not tying into the
existing boiler/chiller.  This assumes you won't have other issues
meeting the conditions for Table G3.1, part #2.

*         I have had the fortune to be involved in a similar high school
project which did not explicitly seek or require LEED certification, but
the district and design team were collectively very energy conscious and
pursued a unique approach without any such mandatory/enforced
regulations.  Budgets were arranged from the beginning to encompass both
a large new building addition in addition to targeted
retrofits/replacements of existing HVAC, envelope and lighting systems.
The cohesive goal was to identify and implement the most cost-effective
means to reduce and minimize the "whole building" EUI and utility bills
- only rarely focusing on the new addition in isolation of the "big
picture."  This was a very involved and satisfying process... and in the
end I think everyone came away feeling the right decisions were made for
the entire facility with the resources available.  With all that in mind
- are you too far along to consider re-allocating (or expanding) your
project budget, perhaps VE-ing portions of the present design, to put
those dollars to more effective use retrofitting/improving existing
systems?  

 

Still for what it's worth, this specific interpretation does come across
as very "by the book" and in practice unreasonably inflexible
considering LEED certification is being sought only for the addition.
On the flip side, the interpretation request language is not nearly so
clear as your more concise email just now - possibly the responder
hasn't fully grasped why you're asking.  If the individual(s) providing
this clarification are open to a discussion, I would propose extending
the conversation to recognize "the whole building must be modeled" and
"the whole building must be incorporated into the performance rating" as
two importantly distinct statements - and that's the clarification
you're driving towards.  

 

It would seem reasonable for the proposed model of a building addition
to incorporate and approximate the systems & building areas not involved
in the addition (modeling the whole building effectively), separately
meter all "existing to remain" loads and systems, and then calculate the
proposed performance rating specifically using a weighted fraction of
the energies consumed by shared & existing-to-remain systems (boilers
and chillers, in this case).  All other consumptions exclusive to the
addition could then be isolated and removed from the performance rating
calculation.  Adopting a procedure along these lines would have a number
of positive effects, including: 

*         Leveling the playing field for additions to small vs. large
buildings

*         Encourage designers to consider replacing, upgrading and/or
improving the operations of existing shared systems to remain

*         Not driving design teams to construct entirely independent
HVAC systems where it may make a lot more sense for the building
owner/environment to utilize existing systems of sufficient capacity.

 

Maybe some of this will help you plot a course with the powers that be,
though I sincerely hope there's a more definite answer/precedent to draw
upon.  

 

Best wishes,

 

~Nick

receiving state funding, CT's High Performance Building Standard applies
which requires a 21% energy cost savings (LEED for Schools Silver is
also targeted for the new addition only). 

 

The new space will have independent/new ventilation systems, but will
most likely utilize the boiler and potentially chillers of the existing
school building. 

 

Buried in ASHRAE modeling guidelines, we discovered (long after project
started and engineers "completed" the model) that  additions and
alterations that share HVAC systems with existing spaces, are required
to include those spaces in their energy model. The new space is designed
for a 24% reduction - but if the existing spaces (approx. 3x the sf of
new space) are included performance will fall way below the required
threshold. 

 

We can't understand how other  LEED projects in similar situations ever
meet energy reduction requirements, has anyone dealt with this on a LEED
project and found ways to circumvent? Has anyone come across a similar
condition, and if so - how did you approach it? 

 

 

Many Thanks in advance - 

 

Vikram

Most existing facilities I've worked with have included an envelope upgrade.
In that light App G allows for us to use the existing envelope for the
baseline.  Not sure if this will be your issue, but I find a lot of the
existing envelopes that I've dealt with are simply CMU.  If the envelope is
held consistent for both the proposed and baseline case, the efficiency of
the HVAC system should shine a little brighter.

Vikram - Is there any way the district thermal methods prescribed by LEED could help?  - Don't know if it will help, just a suggestion.
Perhaps a prescriptive approach is best.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Question: Table G3.1

Hey Vik,

Sounds something like a rock and a hard place, but then I've never pursued LEED for only an addition.  It's my hope someone who has can chime in with a tested position/approach.  I'm unfamiliar with the CT standards but it seems worth nailing down whether they share the same interpretations as well.

I can offer a few scenarios/suggestions that may help work around the situation instead of through it in any case:


*         If your target is to achieve LEED certification for the addition only... I've seen auditorium and periphery spaces in large schools effectively conditioned with their own independent packaged systems... any chance that might be considered for the design?  If so that might conveniently avoid the issue entirely, by not tying into the existing boiler/chiller.  This assumes you won't have other issues meeting the conditions for Table G3.1, part #2.

*         I have had the fortune to be involved in a similar high school project which did not explicitly seek or require LEED certification, but the district and design team were collectively very energy conscious and pursued a unique approach without any such mandatory/enforced regulations.  Budgets were arranged from the beginning to encompass both a large new building addition in addition to targeted retrofits/replacements of existing HVAC, envelope and lighting systems.  The cohesive goal was to identify and implement the most cost-effective means to reduce and minimize the "whole building" EUI and utility bills - only rarely focusing on the new addition in isolation of the "big picture."  This was a very involved and satisfying process... and in the end I think everyone came away feeling the right decisions were made for the entire facility with the resources available.  With all that in mind - are you too far along to consider re-allocating (or expanding) your project budget, perhaps VE-ing portions of the present design, to put those dollars to more effective use retrofitting/improving existing systems?

Still for what it's worth, this specific interpretation does come across as very "by the book" and in practice unreasonably inflexible considering LEED certification is being sought only for the addition.  On the flip side, the interpretation request language is not nearly so clear as your more concise email just now - possibly the responder hasn't fully grasped why you're asking.  If the individual(s) providing this clarification are open to a discussion, I would propose extending the conversation to recognize "the whole building must be modeled" and "the whole building must be incorporated into the performance rating" as two importantly distinct statements - and that's the clarification you're driving towards.

It would seem reasonable for the proposed model of a building addition to incorporate and approximate the systems & building areas not involved in the addition (modeling the whole building effectively), separately meter all "existing to remain" loads and systems, and then calculate the proposed performance rating specifically using a weighted fraction of the energies consumed by shared & existing-to-remain systems (boilers and chillers, in this case).  All other consumptions exclusive to the addition could then be isolated and removed from the performance rating calculation.  Adopting a procedure along these lines would have a number of positive effects, including:

*         Leveling the playing field for additions to small vs. large buildings

*         Encourage designers to consider replacing, upgrading and/or improving the operations of existing shared systems to remain

*         Not driving design teams to construct entirely independent HVAC systems where it may make a lot more sense for the building owner/environment to utilize existing systems of sufficient capacity.


Maybe some of this will help you plot a course with the powers that be, though I sincerely hope there's a more definite answer/precedent to draw upon.

Best wishes,

~Nick

Dear all,

regarding the modelling of curtains in a zone, I would like to know what
the general approach is. It seems logical to model a seperate zone with an
infiltration (to the main zone) of which the flow rate depends on the
opening or closing of the curtain. Mian issue is that such an approach
might affect the solar radiation into the main zone ...

Leen,
  I would think that the approach would differ depending on whether the 
curtains were right up against the window or if they were in a doorway 
between two zones. I would also guess that there would be some 
differences in approach depending on what simulation tool you are using. 
In TRNSYS, curtains up against windows can be handled as a window 
shading device. For curtains separating two zones, you could model the 
opening as an adjacent window (using the virtual /open window 
properties), which would then allow you to define a shading device and 
pass solar radiation from one zone to the other. You can also define 
coupling airflow depending on whether the curtain is open or closed.
best,
  David

Hello colleagues,

In Turkey the demand to green building certificates and its required component of energy modelling is increasing. As being the only team which is expert on building physics and simulations, we are having difficulty to meet this demand with our existing staff (engineers and architects). Since we are giving the other services such as green design, counseling and management, we wish to enlarge our firm with one more mechanical engineer who is especially expert on energy modelling through Design Builder and Energy Plus. 

We will employ him/her in our Istanbul Technical University-Technocity R&D company, EKOMIM (www.ekomim.com). However our web page is not English yet, you can look at our references (http://www.ekomim.com/referanslar.html) and also attaced information about us.

Candidates can apply to yilmazzer at itu.edu.tr or oguz at ekomim.com 

Sincerely,

Prof. Dr. A. Zerrin YILMAZ,

Dear Mr. Sharma,

You are correct that there are no outputs specific to the radiant loop objects or the "InternalSource" constructions that will give you a surface temperature. However, you should be able to grab any surface's temperature with:

Output:Variable,
	SURFACE NAME,
	Surface Inside Temperature,
	Daily OR Hourly;

Regards,
Peter
