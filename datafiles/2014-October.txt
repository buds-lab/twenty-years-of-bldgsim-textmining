Book Talk: Designing with the Sun<https://www.eventbrite.com/e/christoph-reinhart-designing-with-the-sun-tickets-12107145799>
October 16, 2014  |  6:00PM  |  Register here<https://www.eventbrite.com/e/christoph-reinhart-designing-with-the-sun-tickets-12107145799>
Join Green Light New York for a book presentation and dialogue with Christoph Reinhart. His book, Daylighting Handbook Volume 1, adeptly describes the physical characteristics of the sun and the human eye, lays out the design fundamentals of allowing daylight to guide the massing and shading of a project, and describes the tools available to guide analysis. This provides 1.5 AIA learning credits.

Daylight Simulation Workshop: Computer-based Daylight Design<https://www.eventbrite.com/e/daylight-simulation-workshop-tickets-13458435543>
October 17, 2014  |  9:00AM - 4:30PM  |  Register here<https://www.eventbrite.com/e/daylight-simulation-workshop-tickets-13458435543>
Join Christoph Reinhart of MIT, for a full-day technical workshop on daylighting simulation using Rhinoceros 3D 5.0. This workshop is specifically geared towards helping designers and sustainability consultants to learn the basic theory underlying daylight simulations and how to integrate such simulations within their practice. This workshop compliments his recently published book, Daylight Handbook I<http://www.daylightinghandbook.com/>, which introduces basic daylight concepts and rules of thumb for urban massing studies. It is geared towards designers and sustainability consultants.  Participants will learn how to conduct a series of simulation exercises including:
(1) Conducting a LEED 3.0 compliance analysis;
(2) Detecting glare at key positions within a building throughout a year; and
(3) Developing suitable automated electric lighting and shading controls to maximize daylight availability while controlling glare

Message-ID: <CADJFC-E9BrQzfirCfBfEq9QWSYv=ZBydo+wrkxkp3a1FhbBnrA@mail.gmail.com>

Has anyone used PMV (predicted mean vote) in the design of a building? We
are looking for examples where systems, setpoints etc are completely based
on PMV rather than dry bulb temperature. And any performance results - were
people comfortable?

Also, if you've used a different thermal comfort metric for such objectives
I'd be interested to hear about it as well.

Arup DC Projects - Nick Blanton ARUP
Nick Blanton will give a presentation about the design and simulation work completed for several local Arup projects. Specific modeling challenges will be discussed, as well as useful information for up-and-coming simulation consultants, based on experience gained from these projects.

Building Performance Benchmarking beyond Energy Star Portfolio Manager - Hyojin Kim Catholic University
Hyojin Kim will introduce new protocols on building performance measurement and benchmarking developed by ASHRAE, CIBSE, and USGBC: Performance Measurement Protocols (PMP) for Commercial Building. As the first integrated protocols on energy, water, and indoor environmental quality, the PMP is expected to be used as a tool to verify green building practice and to identify building performance-related problems, which will help diminish the observed discrepancy between predicted and actual performance of buildings. An application of the PMP will be demonstrated using a case-study building.

Hayes,

This tool is great, and works for LEED IEQc7 Thermal Comfort compliance as well.

Play around with it, there's lots of bells and whistles, but it's fairly intuitive.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] PMV for Design & Operation

 ASHRAE 55/ISO 7730 has a software program where you can input the air speed, DB/WB temps, clothing levels, occupant metabolic rate, etc and it will draw a comfort region on the psychrometric chart showing you the region with 80% occupant satisfaction (the max achievable value). ASHRAE Handbook shows a table with airspeed in the occupied zone and how you may change the effective draft temperature to maintain same comfort level. For example if you double the room air velocity in the occupied zone from 40 to 80 fpm you can set thermostat from 73 to 75F resulting in same 80% satisfaction level of comfort. This is why ceiling fans are such a good idea. Only downside of increasing room air motion much above 50 fpm is some occupants perceive air motion as drafts, especially those with lighter clothing.

Message-ID: <F35D0B69F4626C4BB7A5074B750F606D10F458E7@ITSMBX-4.lunet.lboro.ac.uk>

Dear all,

Good morning. My name is Eirini Mantesi and I am currently undertaking my doctorate of engineering degree (EngD) in Loughborough University UK. My research topic is about the thermal mass and its contribution to the overall building energy performance. Part of the project is focusing on ICF (Insulating Concrete Formwork). In essence I am trying to investigate the interaction between the concrete core of ICF and the internal environment. I would like to ask you if you know of any building case study, preferably in the UK, that is built in ICF, which has been monitored. And more importantly, if I could have access to the monitoring data.

Thank you in advance for your time and consideration.

Kind Regards,
Eirini Mantesi

Hayes,

This tool is great, and works for LEED IEQc7 Thermal Comfort compliance as well.

http://smap.cbe.berkeley.edu/comforttool

Play around with it, there's lots of bells and whistles, but it's fairly intuitive.

 ASHRAE 55/ISO 7730 has a software program where you can input the air speed, DB/WB temps, clothing levels, occupant metabolic rate, etc and it will draw a comfort region on the psychrometric chart showing you the region with 80% occupant satisfaction (the max achievable value). ASHRAE Handbook shows a table with airspeed in the occupied zone and how you may change the effective draft temperature to maintain same comfort level. For example if you double the room air velocity in the occupied zone from 40 to 80 fpm you can set thermostat from 73 to 75F resulting in same 80% satisfaction level of comfort. This is why ceiling fans are such a good idea. Only downside of increasing room air motion much above 50 fpm is some occupants perceive air motion as drafts, especially those with lighter clothing.

Craig J. Gann, P.E.; LEED AP

Has anyone used PMV (predicted mean vote) in the design of a building? We are looking for examples where systems, setpoints etc are completely based on PMV rather than dry bulb temperature. And any performance results - were people comfortable?

Also, if you've used a different thermal comfort metric for such objectives I'd be interested to hear about it as well.

Dear BLDG-SIM users,


Let me introduce you to the Adapt4EE
<http://www.adapt4ee.eu/adapt4ee/index.html>Project funded by the EU FP7.
Adapt4EE <http://www.adapt4ee.eu/adapt4ee/index.html> aims at augmenting
the contemporary architectural envelope by incorporating business and
occupancy related information thus providing a holistic approach to the
design and evaluation of the energy performance of construction products at
an early stage and prior to their realization.


Some tools have been developed in the context of the project to help
Designers and Engineers to decide among the proposed building designs. One
of these tools, Visual Analytics, is ready to be tested by the
professionals involved in building simulation. We invite you to download
the Visual Analytics tool
<http://www.adapt4ee.eu/adapt4ee/results/tools.html>. The user manual is
installed with the tool, it can be found under the help menu. After your
test we kindly request you to fulfill this questionnaire
<http://www.adapt4ee.eu/adapt4ee/evaluation/index.html>. This is of great
importance for our Project and we thank you in advance for you
participation.

	modeling
Message-ID: <CAOG8z52AVemWwLt0Y7WgPm5YOpCG0FPLgrtsHzd-D=r5UF=Eww@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Bldg-sim community,

IBPSA-USA <http://ibpsa.us/> and Big Ladder Software
<http://bigladdersoftware.com/> are pleased to announce a new, free online
community resource called Unmet Hours (https://unmethours.com/), a
question-and-answer (Q+A) website for building energy modelers.

What is a question-and-answer website? It?s a new type of resource that has
emerged from the programming world as an alternative to mailing lists or
forums. But it?s super simple. You ask a question. Other modelers answer
it. The best answer gets voted to the top. Or you can search on your topic
and you might find that your question has already been asked and answered.
And it?s always good to give back to the community (while showing off your
expertise and earning good ?karma?) by helping other modelers with their
questions.

At Unmet Hours, you can ask questions about any modeling topic or software
tool, including eQUEST
<https://unmethours.com/questions/scope:all/sort:activity-desc/tags:equest/page:1/>,
OpenStudio
<https://unmethours.com/questions/scope:all/sort:activity-desc/tags:openstudio/page:1/>,
EnergyPlus
<https://unmethours.com/questions/scope:all/sort:activity-desc/tags:energyplus/page:1/>,
and many more. Numerous experts are standing by, eager to help, and ready
to answer your questions--big or small. There are already more than 180
registered users, more than 50 questions, and more than 100 answers on the
website.

Unmet Hours offers many capabilities that make it a powerful resource for
the building energy modeling community:


   -

   Each individual question is kept together with its answers on one web
   page that can be easily referenced with a unique URL.
   -

   Answers are peer reviewed and voted on by the community to reach a
   consensus on which ones are most likely to be helpful or ?correct?.
   -

   Questions are easily searchable on the website. All content is indexed
   by Google and other search engines.
   -

   Questions are tagged with category labels such as ?infiltration
   <https://unmethours.com/questions/scope:all/sort:activity-desc/tags:infiltration/page:1/>?,
   ?daylighting
   <https://unmethours.com/questions/scope:all/sort:activity-desc/tags:daylighting/page:1/>?,
   or ?energyplus
   <https://unmethours.com/questions/scope:all/sort:activity-desc/tags:energyplus/page:1/>?
   making it easy to find topics of interest.
   -

   Questions can be tagged across multiple categories for cross-cutting
   problems, for example, ?ashrae-90.1
   <https://unmethours.com/questions/scope:all/sort:activity-desc/tags:ashrae-90.1/page:1/>?,
   ?hvac
   <https://unmethours.com/questions/scope:all/sort:activity-desc/tags:hvac/page:1/>?,
   and ?equest
   <https://unmethours.com/questions/scope:all/sort:activity-desc/tags:equest/page:1/>
   ?.
   -

   Tags or individual questions can be ?followed? to receive email updates
   when there is new or changed content. You control your email update
   preferences.
   -

   Comments are used to discuss or make suggestions about a question or
   answer without distracting from the main content.
   -

   All content is actively moderated and curated by the community.
   Questions and answers can be revised at any time to be clearer and more
   helpful, or to be updated as new information becomes available. It?s a
   living knowledge base.
   -

   And it all works conveniently in the web browser on your smartphone!


You can find Unmet Hours at https://unmethours.com/ It?s a resource for the
building energy modeling community, built by the community. We are counting
on your support and participation to continue its success.

?        Demonstrated experience with sustainable building design.

?        A solid understanding of building construction and environmental science.

?        An ability to read and understand project specifications and drawings.

?        Be a LEED Accredited Professional.

?        Demonstrate proficiency with the US and Canadian LEED Green Building Rating System and Living Building Challenge.

?        Ability to conduct self-directed research and analysis with limited degree of supervision.

?        Have strong oral and written communication skills, and an ability to communicate technical results graphically to architectural project teams.

?        Ability to travel in Canada, United States and internationally.
This position offers a competitive compensation and benefits package.

I have 5 models given to me in eQuest 3.65. They appear well developed and they certainly run.

But I cannot get the 3-D rendering to show the buildings.

Anyone else have this problem and a resolution to this issue?

Thank you.

IBPSA-USA San Francisco Chapter welcomes you all to the October 2014 event.
This month we are excited to have David Scheer from Autodesk to present about their new building performance analysis tools.
Autodesk has had a busy year with intensive investments in building performance analysis tools to integrate information into the Architect's design process, make the job of the professional analyst easier and more consistent by automating tedious tasks, and to create an seamless environment where designers and technical consultants can collaborate more easily.
At this presentation, David Scheer, Sr Product Manager for BPA Integration, will discuss a number of new and improved tools from Autodesk in 2014 and 2015, including Lighting Analysis for Revit, a plugin that helps to automate and speed up the processes of generating valid and useful daylighting analysis results; Solar Analysis for Revit, a plugin that brings the Vasari solar radiation tool and a new, NREL validated algorithm to Revit;  automated EAM (Energy analysis Model) creation from a standard revit architectural model; and Solon Dashboards, RunSets and Energy Cost Range tools, bringing powerful analysis results to the architect like 2030 benchmark, sensitivity results, and interactive parametric tools that can be customized in a collaborative work environment for architects and analysts.
Please RSVP Chris Hughes at chughes at aeieng.com if you are planning to attend in person.
Thanks and best regards,
Jude.

Think we are barking up the wrong tree. Yes, I see the 3-D tab, and the models are 1 to 9 stories. Again, I have 4 gB in RAM. Memory is NOT the issue.

Hi John,
Do you see the 3D tab beside the 2D tab in the building envelope section? If not, then you would need to free more memory on your computer, or view it in a faster computer. 
If it's a tall building and you only need a visual representation (say for showing in a report), save the model in a new name, change the program to go back to wizard mode, and put a check mark for "floor multiplier" in the first window of the building shell that has the most floors. This makes the model to use much less memory and enable you to see it. Just remember that going back to wizard mode would result in all your changes in the details mode to be lost. So if the window sizes were edited in DD mode, you won't see those anymore.

Description:
As design decisions become more data driven, quick and accurate energy calculations become crucial to a project's success.  Traditional energy modeling can be a long, resource intensive process that isn't nimble enough to influence design as it happens.  This session will focus on energy calculation strategies and tools to equip building owners, designers, and energy analysts to make informed decisions in a timely manner.  Energy specialists from CTA Architects Engineers will review and demonstrate several useful tools for energy modeling, benchmarking, renewable energy calculations, and quality control.

Does anyone have experience with both Trane Trace and DesignBuilder?

I am researching the advantages my firm will gain from DesignBuilder. The 3D, Revit compatibility, Daylighting, Optimization and CFD are very appealing and I can see how these would allow us to help client's in new ways. DesignBuilder seems to be relatively new as a full-fledged EnergyPlus interface. I am having trouble finding 3rd party reviews or comparisons of this software. Really just having trouble finding anything bad about it at all except for bloggers complaining about it not being as user friendly as they thought(I can't imagine it being any worse than Trace). I am also skeptical about its ability to transfer geometry from Revit - Especially since generally our Revit models are not full BIM models.

A little background:
I work for a full service A&E firm. We are primarily a "production" firm and work with a lot of Commercial - Retail building. We are looking to expand what we do with our energy services. We currently run all of our HVAC loads, LEED and Code compliance models with Trane Trace. We use Revit for almost all of our projects.

Thanks everyone!

My experience is that Design builder is much more intuitive than TRACE, and
that GBXML is possible with design builder so long as you enclose your
zones. Since your firm is a Revit user, you have a real advantage with
Design Builder over Trace if you use their Revit plugin.  Design Builder
recently added a lot of ASHRAE 90.1 templates etc so your LEED projects
will be easier.

Hello bldg-sim community!

My name is Alex and I am a graduate student at City College of New York.
If possible I would like to ask you about EnergyPlus (EP) and the weather
file inter-work.

By reading the EP manual I understood that EP only uses *dirnorrad *(direct
normal radiation), *difhorrad *(diffuse horizontal radiation) and
*horirsky* (horizontal_infrared_radiation_intensity_from_sky)
to handle all calculations.

Why EP has this specific 'horirsky' (only IR spectrum) since EP already has
the 'dirnorrad' and 'difhorrad' inputs; that both include the whole EM
spectrum?

Thank you in advance.

Best,
Alex

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Building materials data import to Energy plus
Message-ID: <CACj692GfBD97-RQegqtovQzNckKJXS_BH5A1_-PeHZLYSGw99g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear colleagues,

I am writing my Master thesis about the interoperability between ArchiCAD,
Revit and Allplan on one side and Energy plus on the other side.

My research is particularly focused on importing the correct materials data
into IDF. (Materials should contain roughness, thickness, thermal
conductivity, density, specific heat; be composed into constructions and
attached to the correct surfaces in the geometry.)

I am collecting data on the following aspects:

1. *Is there a tool that imports IFC to Energy plus?*

Simergy has announced that they are removing the import features because of
many bugs and Ecotect is not fully supported by Autodesk anymore. On the
official EP website it is stated that such tool does not exist.
http://energyplus.helpserve.com/knowledgebase/article/View/25/34/importing-ifc-geometry-into-energyplus

2. *Any experiences in the seamless import of the materials?*

3.
*Do you generally use the import/export, or do you normally redraw the
simplified geometry in Sketchup for your projects?*
My findings at the present moment are the following:

*- *gbxML preserves the most of material parameters for Energy plus but
only Revit supports the advanced export to the gbXML. ArchiCAD works via
the Cadimage plugin (available only for the 17th version at the moment).
This plug-in does not preserve the material properties. And Allplan does
not export gbXML, only IFCs. All of the architectural software producers
seem to work more in the area of integrated energy analysis rather than on
improving their export.

- two plug-ins for exporting gbXML to Energy plus were tested: Green
Building studio and Open studio for Sketchup. GBS assigns its own
constructions instead of mine (I am working on it) and OS imports
everything but does not assign the constructions to the surfaces.

Please share your experiences, comments and opinions on this topic. Any
suggestions are welcomed.

Thank you in advance,

 Anna,

Shearing my experience with GBXML and IFC:

I have not used the latest open studio or Simergy GBXML imports, as they in
general just do not seem to work as well for me as Design Builder
or legacy open studio. However my usage of a UI is really to author an
energy plus IDF, and most of the models I do is to demonstrate the use of
our PCM and are done as quickly as possible.

My experience with GBXML has been with Design Builder, I note that in v4
Design Builder can also import materials.  For IFC there is the space
boundary tool that I have attempted to use gaia.lbl.gov/interoperability/SBT
.

The main problem I have had with GBXML is that 3d cad models are not
normally setup so that the user can just export their GBXML file. The cad
designer typically are only drawing for export into 2d sheets, and as such
have really messy 3d cad models that do not connect the walls to the
ceilings or other problems.

For the space boundary tool it does not seem to work on files that do not
seem to have any real problems. I tried it out on a couple projects and got
nice a looking 3d IFC model, but then the import to SBT failed. The error
messages are unclear and the tutorial seems to assume that the user
also has the
Solbri model checker. There is an IDF that maps ArchiCAD and
Revit materials to Energy Plus objects that comes with the
space boundary tool that you may find useful.

>From my experience, asking an architect to export either file is risky as I
may be asking them to do a lot of work only to provide a file that may not
import, or may import but not run or it has lots of unnecessary surfaces.

The best way I have found to make GBXML useful has been to have the cad
user provide only the shell of the building with no internal walls.  (The
materials import is not something I have tried, as Design Builder just
recently added this feature.) The reason is that the model may
have different zoning and other simplifications that are used to make a
clean E+ model that is close enough to the project geometry and because I
tend use my own materials database.

I keep thinking of developing a python script that generates IDF objects
from IFC, GBXML or 3D Cad file for only the external walls and roofs and
floors, only internal floors and ceilings and only the external windows.
Material properties could be useful, but the time needed to setup
some materials and construction layers is null compared to the time it
takes to get the windows drawn on for each elevation or for the geometry in
general.

Please keep in mind that this is my experience and may not represent
the experiences of other users.  Hope this is helpful, and best of luck
with your project.

Hi Shane,



We use DesignBuilder for our energy models, and find it quite user
friendly. Although I may just be used to it.



In regards to Revit importing, we don?t do it based on the advice of the
support guys, as the general feeling at the moment is that its more effort
to clean up a Revit model than to just build a new simplified one for the
energy model.



The CFD capability is quite new, and in my opinion still very basic. For
anything beyond simple analysis I would look at other, CFD specific
software. The meshing tools and boundary condition options are quite
limited.



And again for optimization, after having a play with it we determined it
didn?t provide us the value for the cost. But that would again depend on
the user.



The HVAC is good, but like many software options doesn?t utilise the ePlus
capability to do VRV. This is a bit of a limitation.



In terms of energy models however we still use it and rate it quite well.
Relatively simple to change things, setup templates for quick model setup
etc.



All in all definitely worth downloading the trial and spending some time on
it to see if you like it.



Cheers,

Mike

Does anyone have experience with both Trane Trace and DesignBuilder?



I am researching the advantages my firm will gain from DesignBuilder. The
3D, Revit compatibility, Daylighting, Optimization and CFD are very
appealing and I can see how these would allow us to help client?s in new
ways. DesignBuilder seems to be relatively new as a full-fledged EnergyPlus
interface. I am having trouble finding 3rd party reviews or comparisons of
this software. Really just having trouble finding anything bad about it at
all except for bloggers complaining about it not being as user friendly as
they thought(I can?t imagine it being any worse than Trace). I am also
skeptical about its ability to transfer geometry from Revit - Especially
since generally our Revit models are not full BIM models.



A little background:

I work for a full service A&E firm. We are primarily a ?production? firm
and work with a lot of Commercial ? Retail building. We are looking to
expand what we do with our energy services. We currently run all of our
HVAC loads, LEED and Code compliance models with Trane Trace. We use Revit
for almost all of our projects.



Thanks everyone!

You know when your looking for something on the internet and find something completely unrelated but more interesting.

That just happened to me, and it is related to buildings.

Here is the closest I found to "modeling":

Sorry for being so off-topic.

I've used DesignBuilder for a few years, with a bit of experience with
Trace. I have a mixed experience with DB, difficult to recommend outright,
but worth a trial.

When DesignBuilder works, it works great. However there are many instances
where it is unclear how to model something or interpret results. It's much
more complex, and the effort in learning how to overcome a problem will
typically occur exactly when I have a deadline. The

Maybe this is due to the newer version, but on the plus side the gbXML
import for geometry went smoothly for me. I just finished a project last
week where I drew geometry in Revit, added spaces and zones, client
reviewed internal gains on my A0 printouts, and imported geometry into DB.
The zone and construction parameters didn't transfer, so this was done in
DB templates by naming the zones in Revit with their space types. The
internal DB geometry editor is also nice, but it can be cumbersome for
complex buildings, especially if you need to change zoning later. So if you
have experience in Revit I would recommend gbXML route instead.

I used DB to analyze the effects of automatically controlled shading, and
was optimizing the angle of external blind slats and reporting results on
an hourly basis, very detailed with nice results. However for the final
cooling loads I still used Trace! (Trace also imports gbXML)

And I concur with Mike - please leave the CFD to CFD experts.

Message-ID: <001001cff1e6$6a7d91a0$3f78b4e0$@simulaciebudov.sk>

Dear All,

 

Should the humidification system be included in the Baseline building if it
is present in the Propose building?

 

It is common practice to include humidification system in the 5A Climate
zone here in Europe to keep relative

humidity above at least 35% in winter.

Hi Milan,

Yes, if you have it included in the Proposed building you should have it included in the Baseline as well. See Table G3.1, 1b. which requires the humidity control setpoints to be the same for proposed and baseline design. However, you can alter the humidification system to demonstrate energy savings (e.g., atomizing humidifiers, etc.).

S pozdravom,
Norbert Repka

My name is Georgios Kazas and I am Early Stage Researcher , member of the

I simulate a model in energyplus. I noticed in the HTML report a district
heating conversion factor equal to 3.613. Do you know please, how I could
change this district heating conversion factor?

Thanking you in advance.

Georgios,

For all others fuells, you'd set that in FuelFactors.

But for district heating and cooling, you want to play with
EnvironmentalImpactFactors. You'll be able to adjust the heating efficiency
and the cooling COP, in order to get the conversion factors you want from
site to source.
"Object Description: Used to help convert district and ideal energy use to
a fuel type and provide total carbon equivalent with coefficients
Also used in Source=>Site conversions."

I suggest you take a look at the Input/output reference manual, in the
section "EnvironmentalImpactFactors" (in the I/O reference for v8.2, it's
on page 2162/2234)

Cheers,
Julien

Message-ID: <4ed37b4e99024c8296590d50487a22f6@S05-MBX03-04.S05.local>

Hello group.

I'm looking for insight on (and potentially a sample) of standard disclaimer text for an energy modeling study done during the design phase.

You, the kind of thing that would say something like "while all efforts have been made to create an accurate energy model, software limitations, actual final design parameters and real-life operation may result in a significantly different energy consumption than the one predicted" or something to this effect.

If there is none on the market currently, developing one could be a good "safety valve", no?

Thanks and regards,

Frederic,
You could use the following language from ASHRAE Standard 90.1, Appendix G, Note 2 to G1.2, as a basis for your standard disclaimer:
"Neither the proposed building performance nor the baseline building performance are predictions of actual energy consumption or costs for the proposed design after construction. Actual experience will differ from these calculations due to variations such as occupancy, building operation and maintenance, weather, energy use not covered by this procedure, changes in energy rates between design of the building and occupancy, and the precision of the calculation tool."
Regards,
Bill

Message-ID: <92B4D0F578AB284AAD350E3D3C74795C495D1948@TIS104.uopnet.plymouth.ac.uk>

The Board of Directors of IBPSA is seeking nominations for the 2015 Class of Fellows. The IBPSA membership grade of Fellow recognizes individuals who are:

"A member who has attained distinction in the field of building performance simulation, or in the allied arts or sciences, or in teaching of major courses in said arts and sciences, or who by way of research, simulation code development, original work, or application of building simulation on projects of a significant scope, has made substantial contribution to said arts and sciences, and has been active in the field for at least ten (10) years".

The IBPSA Board of Directors elects new Fellows on a two-year cycle, culminating with recognition at the biennial Building Simulation conference, which will take place in Hyderabad, India next year.
Nominations may be made by IBPSA members other than the nominee. The application package will include details of the nominee's qualifications, a CV, supporting letters, and other relevant materials. The details of the nominee's qualifications shall include summaries of accomplishments in one or more of the following categories: industrial leadership, research, simulation code development, application of building simulation on projects of significant scope, educational leadership, and significant technical contributions to the allied arts and sciences. The application form and instructions are available on the web at:

  *   http://www.ibpsa.org/downloads/fellow_nomination_application.pdf
  *   http://www.ibpsa.org/downloads/fellow_application_instructions.pdf

Nominations must be submitted via email to the Chair of the Awards and Fellows Committee, Pieter de Wilde, at pieter.dewilde at plymouth.ac.uk. The deadline for nominations is 31 January 2015. Please contact Pieter de Wilde to discuss a possible nomination if required.


Note that IBPSA will, at a later stage, also call for nominations for the three main IPBSA Awards as well as Student Travel Awards. In order for the committee to process all nominations, we have phased these over three deadlines. Nominations for the IBPSA Awards will be due on 14 March 2015, and nominations for the Student Travel Awards will be due on 15 April 2015. Details on these other categories can be found at www.ibpsa.org<http://www.ibpsa.org> through the 'awards' page. Calls for nomination for these categories will be posted on the this mailing list 3 months in advance.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED Energy Model - 90.1-2004 Appendix G and Local
 Code
Message-ID: <F5CF4382CED3CD40853C46D7E23808B13AE8BC22@GE-MAIL.GE.Adir>

I came across this old post regarding LEED energy modeling versus local code.

http://lists.onebuilding.org/pipermail/bldg-sim-onebuilding.org/2008-October/037274.html

I have been searching for an answer as to whether LEED will accept the local code lighting power density allowable using the building area method using an ASHRAE 90.1-2007 baseline. The local jurisdiction adopted IECC 2012 as of July 2012 but the projects is registered under LEED 2009, using the ASHRAE 90.1-2007 baseline. Per IECC 2012 either the IECC lighting densities can be used, or there is an alternative compliance path that allows ASHRAE 90.1-2010 to be used. Both of those have a building area lighting allowance of 0.90 W/SF for an office building versus 1.0 W/SF for ASHRAE 90.1-2007.

Has anyone attempted to claim a lighting power reduction when the local code requires a stricter lighting density than the current LEED version being used for a project? This seems to be a reasonable justification since the proposed building will be required to meet a more strict standard than the baseline standard.

I've successfully claimed lighting energy savings for tenant improvement
areas of Core & Shell projects subject to the Seattle Energy Code which
would require the tenant improvements to be subject to a LPD that was more
stringent than ASHRAE 90.1.  Your approach sounds reasonable.
