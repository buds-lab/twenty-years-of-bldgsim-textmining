Subject: [Bldg-sim] Common loop distributed heat pump system
Message-ID: <CACMLFkwYFk00KhPfCYYxAWHvJrzUgmeDFr4uXaj0Kp_bHknixQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am trying to model a system involving water source heat pumps using
eQuest.  If someone can please help me by providing modelling guidelines, I
will really be thankful.  Here is the description of the system.

Load Information:  The building will be a commercial space, which will have
a balanced heating and cooling load in winder and shoulder season.  During
winter, the heating load in the perimeter zones will be offset by the
cooling load in the core zones.  To explain further, I will have one common
supply loop supplying to both the perimeter and the core zones.  Heat pumps
in the perimeter zones will extract heat from the common supply loop and
return colder water to the same supply loop; where as heat pumps in the
core zones will use the cooler water in the common supply loop to reject
heat from the space and return hotter water to the same loop.  Basically
there will be only one supply loop which will keep on circulating water
within itself; there is no return loop at all.

How would I model this in eQest.  Is there any way I can trick the system
to model it?  Also, in case if there is extra heat in the loop, I am trying
to store that in a thermal storage.  How do I model a thermal storage
system in eQuest?

Thank you in advance for your help.

Regards,

Hassan Quazi, P.Eng.

condenser refrigerant flowing through the building, exchanging heat with
the heat pumps in the perimeter zone, whereas the evaporator loop will
collect heat from the core zones.

Hi Hassan,



I feel I summarized the present status of VRF/VRV system simulation with
eQuest pretty well in the attached thread from a few months ago.  I?d
advise you to review/understand my response first, then acquire the
manufacturer?s guidance for the system you are referencing.  For heat
recovery, you will need to do ?Post-processing? of the results to determine
how much free heating/cooling is occurring by way of refrigerant heat
recovery.  Approximating thermal storage from the VRF/VRV system will
require a more fundamental & intimate understanding of how the systems
operate together, as you will need to modify/expand upon the recommended
post-processing calculations.



FWIW, VRF/VRV thermal storage is to my knowledge a step beyond the
boundaries of what?s been documented procedurally by anybody (and shared
with the greater simulation community), at least for eQuest/DOE2.  Some
degree of innovation is probably on-tap to complete the job on your own =).



More broadly, be mindful of the onebuilding.org archives for these mailing
lists ? they continually build as a primary resource of answers and
information, and every end-user of eQuest ought to bookmarked/favorite
these links, at minimum.

http://lists.onebuilding.org/pipermail/equest-users-onebuilding.org/

http://lists.onebuilding.org/pipermail/bldg-sim-onebuilding.org/



Also, a reminder that your queries and the resulting discussion(s) can be
more difficult/fragmented for yourself and others to follow when you
cross-post to separate mailing lists.  Sometimes cross-posting is the
correct choice based on circumstance, but for  an eQuest-specific query you
are probably better of posting only to [eQuest-users] first.



Kind regards,



~Nick

Subject: [Bldg-sim] The calculated ground temperature exceeds -100 C
Message-ID: <013801d03ff6$eec5f5c0$cc51e140$@gmail.com>

Hi All:

 

I am trying to run the residential prototype downloaded from the EnergyPlus
website with the TMY3 weather data. But there was a fatal error that caused
termination of the simulation. The prototype file is
"SF_Arizona_Winslow.Muni.AP.723740_elecres_slab_IECC_2012.idf" (I converted
it from version 5 to version 7.2, so that I can run it with Energyplus 7.2),
and the weather file is "USA_AZ_Show.Low.Muni.AP.723747_TMY3.epw". 

I have attached both file in the email, in case anyone want to reproduce the
error message.  

 

Here is the error message:

 

Program Version,EnergyPlus-Windows-OMP-64 7.2.0.006, YMD=2015.02.03
14:07,IDD_Version 7.2.0.006

   ** Warning ** Output:PreprocessorMessage="GroundTempCalc - Slab" has the
following Warning condition:

   **   ~~~   ** Slab thickness [0.100 m] reset to 0.122 m  for

   ** Severe  ** Output:PreprocessorMessage="GroundTempCalc - Slab" has the
following Severe condition:

   **   ~~~   ** The calculated ground temperature exceeds -100 C [-389.47
C]

   ** Severe  ** Output:PreprocessorMessage="GroundTempCalc - Slab" has the
following Fatal condition:

   **   ~~~   ** Program terminates due to preceding condition.

   **  Fatal  ** Preprocessor condition(s) cause termination.

   ...Summary of Errors that led to program termination:

   ..... Reference severe error count=2

   ..... Last severe error=Output:PreprocessorMessage="GroundTempCalc -
Slab" has the following Fatal condition:

   ************* Warning:  Node connection errors not checked - most system
input has not been read (see previous warning).

   ************* Fatal error -- final processing.  Program exited before
simulations began.  See previous error messages.

   ************* EnergyPlus Warmup Error Summary. During Warmup: 0 Warning;
0 Severe Errors.

   ************* EnergyPlus Sizing Error Summary. During Sizing: 0 Warning;
0 Severe Errors.

   ************* EnergyPlus Terminated--Fatal Error Detected. 1 Warning; 2
Severe Errors; Elapsed Time=00hr 00min  0.67sec

 

I think the major problem is that "The calculated ground temperature exceeds
-100 C [-389.47 C]". I don't know why this will happen. I didn't modify the
prototype and weather file, except the conversion of idf version. 

 

Thanks very much for any suggestion.

 

Sincerely,

 

Jianhua

Dear simulators,

The time is here again to submit articles and announcements for the upcoming issue of IBPSA News (April 2015).  As usual, it would be good to receive an announcement from each IBPSA Affiliate as to activities that have taken place in their region, including conferences and meetings. Items related to software news are also encouraged: new releases, updates, new versions, training seminars, notable projects, etc. - all gratefully received.

Please send the article(s) to me at your earliest convenience so they arrive before 13th March 2015, if possible.

Many thanks for your assistance and contributions.

Best regards,

Christina Hopfe
IBPSA News Editor-in-Chief

The EnergyPlus Slab preprocessor fails with some weather files when 
Evapotranspiration= TRUE.  A fix was made to get around this in v8.1.  
With v7.2, if you change Evapotranspiration to FALSE, it should run 
successfully.  EnergyPlus is now at v8.2.

Hi Mike:

Thanks for the information. I just checked the idf file, and it looks that
the evapotranspiration is set to FALSE by default. (I found two
evapotranspiration parameters in the file, and they are both set to FALSE)

  GroundHeatTransfer:Slab:BoundConds,
    FALSE,                   !- EVTR: Is surface evapotranspiration modeled
    TRUE,                    !- FIXBC: is the lower boundary at a fixed
temperature
    10,                      !- TDEEPin {C}
    FALSE;                   !- USRHflag: Is the ground surface h specified
by the user?

  GroundHeatTransfer:Basement:SurfaceProps,
    0.16,                    !- ALBEDO: Surface albedo for No snow
conditions
    0.4,                     !- ALBEDO: Surface albedo for snow conditions
    0.94,                    !- EPSLN: Surface emissivity No Snow
    0.86,                    !- EPSLN: Surface emissivity with Snow
    6,                       !- VEGHT: Surface roughness No snow conditions
{cm}
    0.25,                    !- VEGHT: Surface roughness Snow conditions
{cm}
    False;                   !- PET: Flag, Potential evapotranspiration on?

I also tried to update the EnergyPlus to V8.1 and V8.2. Unfortunately, none
of them work, and I still get the same errors. 

Any other idea what happened? Thanks for any suggestion!

Sincerely,

Jianhua

These weather files are great, thanks for the info, but I am trying to 
get wet bulb temperature too, and they do not seem to give wet bulb 
temperatures.

Any ideas on that, perhaps?

Wet Bulb is not part of the weather files I'm familiar with.  Dry Bulb and
Dewpoint are normally goven, though, and you can derive WB from those two
values.

Wet-bulb is not generally measured in weather stations, but can be derived from other 
measured climatic variables, such as dry-bulb temperature, dew-point temperature, and 
atmospheric pressure.  Unfortunately, the derivation requires several equations and 
trial-and-error iteration (see Chapter 1 of the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals).  If you 
don't relish writing a script or program to do this, you can look at the unpacked DOE-2 
format (*.FMT or *.FMTM)  of the weather file, which does contain the calculated wet-bulb 
temperatures in the first data column (see attached sample snippet).  However,  you will 
need a utility Fortran program wthfmt2.f or wthfmt3.f  to convert the packed (*.BIN or 
*.BINM) DOE-2 file to a humanly -readable text  *.FMT or *.FMTM file.

E-mail me for details.

Robert,

There are a number of free plugins and libraries to do such calculations.
That's includes some in Excel (VBA-based), such as Numerical Logic
<http://www.numlog.ca/psychrometrics/psychrometrics.html> (I've used this
one succesfully-avaliable both in SI or IP units) or Psych
<http://wcec.ucdavis.edu/resources/software-resource-applications/>.

I've used one in Python too called CoolProp <http://www.coolprop.org/>
(also has other wrappers and interfaces in other languages)

Hope this helps
Julien

Forgot to attach the snippet, but it seems like others have mentioned various tools that 
can calculate the Wetbulb.

Robert,
Once you get two psychrometric data points of moist air, you should be able to derive the other properties that you desire.  A lot of the hourly weather files just happen to provide humidity in DP.  Obviously if you have more than a few data points to evaluate (like a full TMY3 file), looking them up on a psych chart isn?t very practical.  Unless you?re particularly interested in evaluating partial pressure equations, I would recommend using readily available software as a data filtering tool.  I recommend ClimateConsultant which is a free software produced by UCLA:
http://www.energy-design-tools.aud.ucla.edu/climate-consultant/request-climate-consultant.php

The software can be used for visualizing weather data and evaluating heating and cooling strategies.  It?s great for that, but I often simply use it to filter raw weather files and then export to Excel.  The whole process takes 5 minutes once you have the software installed.  You simply find the appropriate EPW weather file (EnergyPlus format) from the web (link provided in the software) and import it into ClimateConsultant.  You can then export to csv.  I like how the software will automatically convert from SI to IP units.  You can choose other ways of representing humidity like RH and WB.  You can also use it to quickly construct daily or monthly averages if desired.

[cid:image001.png at 01D04490.51334BC0]

Anyway, that?s my plug for ClimateConsultant for those of us that can?t program good data filters (or are too lazy).  I hope it?s helpful.

These weather files are great, thanks for the info, but I am trying to get wet bulb temperature too, and they do not seem to give wet bulb temperatures.

Any ideas on that, perhaps?

To add to the list of tools that already does this for you:

IES VE does this for you in the Vista application.  Whether you?ve run an annual simulation or not, you can plot multiple variables overlaid on one another:

[cid:image002.jpg at 01D044B8.F4201980]

[cid:image003.jpg at 01D044B8.F4201980]

3D graphs:

?Heat Maps?:

[cid:image008.jpg at 01D044B8.F4201980]

You can also create your own custom variables in the VE (so you could create an enthalpy variable from the other variables and plot it on a graph or export to a spreadsheet, etc.):

[cid:image012.png at 01D044B6.3B232500]

This is a .EPW file format from: http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/cfm/weather_data3.cfm/region=4_north_and_central_america_wmo_region_4/country=1_usa/cname=USA
For those of you still tuned in ? a bit of a digression:

Note the values that are errors in June and August (the DB is well below freezing 10 F) ? that?s never happened in the recorded history of the area ? let alone in the timeframe that TMY3 files are comprised of).  The coldest value EVER for the entire state in the month of August is 21 F.  That occurred in Kelliher which is more than 200 miles north of this location.

I?d suggest opening any of the climate files you get and ensuring they aren?t full of invalid data points.  I?ve found far too many of them to be too error-filled to be useful for simulation.  Eden Prairie, MN (still spelled incorrectly on the DOE website ? ?Edin?) is also rife with sub-zero temperatures in May (also never happened in recorded history).  The Portland, OR TMY3 has 114 F days in late October (ditto).  I think you get the idea.

The revised TMY3 files in EPW and BINM formats are available for free download on the White Box Technologies web site at  http://weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com/wd-TMY3 or by selecting File Type as "TMY3" at http:/weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com/search<http://weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com/search> to search using GoogleEarth. The zip file names are unchanged, but the underlying EPW and DDY files will have the *TYA designation to distinguish them from the previous TMY3 versions.

Hi Christopher,



We had a relatively thorough discussion on this issue over on the
[eQuest-users] mailing list in the spring and fall of last year.  See
attached emails.  (I?ve had a few reports of my attachments not getting
through lately ? let me know off-list if you have the same problem and I?ll
copy-paste the text).



Note the same problem of how to arrive at thermal efficiency (rather than
combustion less flue/jacket losses) exists in 90.1-2007.  At one point, I
laid out a series of logical approaches to the matter in order of
increasing difficulty & increasing performance in one of those threads.
?Easiest? approach would be to do as you suggest and treat Ec = Et (and in
turn to treat the Proposed in a similar fashion, deliberately EXCLUDING
flue/jacket losses in the simulation).

Nathan,
After you pointed this out, we started exploring this issue and did find significant differences in current weather files and 30 year average/EPW files.
As IBPSA members, we should take this issue up on a national level to come up with a resolution.

To add to the list of tools that already does this for you:

IES VE does this for you in the Vista application.  Whether you?ve run an annual simulation or not, you can plot multiple variables overlaid on one another:

[cid:image001.jpg at 01D04557.6EF89300]

[cid:image002.jpg at 01D04557.6EF89300]

?Heat Maps?:

[cid:image006.jpg at 01D04557.6EF89300]

You can also create your own custom variables in the VE (so you could create an enthalpy variable from the other variables and plot it on a graph or export to a spreadsheet, etc.):

[cid:image007.png at 01D04557.6EF89300]

This is a .EPW file format from: http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/cfm/weather_data3.cfm/region=4_north_and_central_america_wmo_region_4/country=1_usa/cname=USA
For those of you still tuned in ? a bit of a digression:

Note the values that are errors in June and August (the DB is well below freezing 10 F) ? that?s never happened in the recorded history of the area ? let alone in the timeframe that TMY3 files are comprised of).  The coldest value EVER for the entire state in the month of August is 21 F.  That occurred in Kelliher which is more than 200 miles north of this location.

I?d suggest opening any of the climate files you get and ensuring they aren?t full of invalid data points.  I?ve found far too many of them to be too error-filled to be useful for simulation.  Eden Prairie, MN (still spelled incorrectly on the DOE website ? ?Edin?) is also rife with sub-zero temperatures in May (also never happened in recorded history).  The Portland, OR TMY3 has 114 F days in late October (ditto).  I think you get the idea.

Robert,
Once you get two psychrometric data points of moist air, you should be able to derive the other properties that you desire.  A lot of the hourly weather files just happen to provide humidity in DP.  Obviously if you have more than a few data points to evaluate (like a full TMY3 file), looking them up on a psych chart isn?t very practical.  Unless you?re particularly interested in evaluating partial pressure equations, I would recommend using readily available software as a data filtering tool.  I recommend ClimateConsultant which is a free software produced by UCLA:
http://www.energy-design-tools.aud.ucla.edu/climate-consultant/request-climate-consultant.php

The software can be used for visualizing weather data and evaluating heating and cooling strategies.  It?s great for that, but I often simply use it to filter raw weather files and then export to Excel.  The whole process takes 5 minutes once you have the software installed.  You simply find the appropriate EPW weather file (EnergyPlus format) from the web (link provided in the software) and import it into ClimateConsultant.  You can then export to csv.  I like how the software will automatically convert from SI to IP units.  You can choose other ways of representing humidity like RH and WB.  You can also use it to quickly construct daily or monthly averages if desired.

[cid:image009.png at 01D04557.6EF89300]

Anyway, that?s my plug for ClimateConsultant for those of us that can?t program good data filters (or are too lazy).  I hope it?s helpful.

These weather files are great, thanks for the info, but I am trying to get wet bulb temperature too, and they do not seem to give wet bulb temperatures.

Any ideas on that, perhaps?

White Box Technologies (WBT), in collaboration with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), has revised the TMY3 weather files to correct inconsistencies in units for illuminances, improve the reporting of Liquid Precipitation, replace all missing records with interpolated or filled values (chiefly for visibility, ceiling height, aerosol optical depth, and albedo), and add a new variable for Present Weather.

Since their release in 2005, the TMY3 weather files covering 1,020 locations in the US and dependencies has become the standard set of weather files for use in computer simulations of solar energy conversion systems and buildings. The intent of this revision is not to redo the fundamental analysis, but correct some known errors and make modest improvements in the reporting of subsidiary climate variables.

The only impact from these corrections and changes are for daylighting simulations that use the illuminance values, and for building simulations that use the liquid precipitation to model green roofs or moisture transport through the building envelope. The added Present Weather variable is not directly used in any simulation program, but allows the DOE-2 BINM files to have correct IRAIN and ISNOW flags, although these two variables are not being used in DOE-2.  Filling in missing data for Visibility, Ceiling Height, etc., should have no impact on the use of the TMY3s, but improves their overall record-keeping.

The revised TMY3 files in their native CSV format have been provided back to NREL and are available here:    http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/1991-2005/tmy3

The revised TMY3 files in EPW and BINM formats are available for free download on the White Box Technologies web site at  http://weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com/wd-TMY3 or by selecting File Type as "TMY3" at http:/weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com/search<http://weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com/search> to search using GoogleEarth. The zip file names are unchanged, but the underlying EPW and DDY files will have the *TYA designation to distinguish them from the previous TMY3 versions.

For a more detailed description and full documentation of the revision,  please see the attached memorandum.

Hi Kapil,

Several people have emailed me off the list to express a similar sentiment.  I?ll let them remain anonymous unless they choose to chime in.

Two parts to this email: further exploration of the problems in part 1 and some ideas for solutions in part 2.

Part 1.

I?ve presented on this topic at ASHRAE conferences as well as whenever I do a training on doing LEED or code compliance energy simulation.  I?ve done my own sensitivity analysis of many of the free Minneapolis area climate files and found I can vary the EUI of an office building with a VAV system by 14% just by selecting a different climate file that?s 12 miles away.  Even more interesting (at least to me) was that I could change which design decision was best by changing the climate file.  For example, the MSP climate file resulted in glazing X being the lowest EUI while selecting the Eden Prairie file (12 miles away) resulted in glazing Y being the best.  There?s no micro climates involved and both of these files ?bin out? to CZ6.  However, neither of them are particularly ?representative?.  Eden Prairie has -12 F hours in May while the MSP file has 92 F degree hours in April.  A quick check of the historical records show that -12F has never happened in recorded history in May in the Minneapolis area.  Anyone who lives in Minneapolis can tell you that 90+ in April isn?t common.  Even 70+ in April isn?t that common.  A quick check of the historical record shows one time in nearly 200 years of records where above 90 was recorded before April 15.  The third file, Crystal, was documented as having sub-freezing temps in the summer months in my previous reply to this thread.  So that?s not representative, either.  If there were no other options (which there are), I?d go with MSP as the best of a bad hand of climate files.

Appendix G only requires in G2.3 (90.1-2010): ?The simulation program shall perform the simulation using hourly values of climatic data, such as temperature and humidity from representative climatic data, for the site in which the proposed design is to be located.  For cities or urban regions with several climatic data entries, and for locations where weather data are not available, the designer shall select available weather data that best represent the climate at the construction site.  The selected weather data shall be approved by the rating authority.?

The way this is written, I can literally pick any weather file ? even if it is known to be filled with errors ? and use it for LEED compliance and/or code as long as its nearby my proposed building.  It?s up to the rating authority to question it.

I?ve gotten many LEED review and code review comments in doing simulation.  I?ve never once been asked about the quality of the climate data that was used in the simulation.  Yet it impacts everything in the simulation: envelope, equipment performance (as many equipment performance curves are dependent on ambient conditions), and glazing selection just to name a few.

The mentality of ?plug and chug?, or worse, not even bothering to know which climate file your simulation program is actually using when it spits out results, is a very dangerous game if you?re at all concerned about a reliable result ? and by extension ? providing your customers with sound recommendations on how to spend their money.

While nothing is perfect, I?ve had good experiences with using www.weatheranalytics.com<http://www.weatheranalytics.com> as a source for both TMY and AMY files.  If there?s a problem with a file they create, they?ve been really good about making it right quickly.

Another big problem with the free TMY3 files is they aren?t very up to date (2005 was ten years ago).  Which is another reason why I like weatheranalytics.com ? I can get more up-to-date weather data to help make a more informed decision.

Part 2.

In my opinion, Appendix G needs a new section for compliance: Pre-simulation Climate Analysis (call it Table G3.09).


1.       Perform analysis on at least 1 TMY and 3 AMY (within the last 10 years) climate files near your site.  If three aren?t available, document where you looked and what process was done to select the climate file used in simulation.  (Although with services like Weather Analytics now available, this shouldn?t really be a problem for pretty much any project anywhere).  Submit plots of dry-bulb temperatures and provide a narrative describing the process used in selecting the climate file used in the simulation.  Include metrics like climate zone, bin analysis, and numerical justifications as well as local knowledge from trusted data sets in either the public or private domain.

2.       Document both the ASHRAE defined climate zone from 90.1/169 and perform your own BIN analysis in accordance with ASHRAE methodology for non-defined locations.  Submit both the defined climate zone and the derived climate zone.  If they are different, advise as to which climate zone is being used in the simulation for baseline building generation.

?       Fun facts (using TMY3 data sets): Dallas is defined at CZ 3A, it bins out to 2A.  Nashville is defined as CZ 4A, it bins out to 3A.  Toronto is defined as 6A, it bins out to 4A.  All these are listed in 90.1-2010 which is the referenced standard in LEED v4 as well as an approved compliance path in IECC 2012.  This is another potential design quandary: to get code approval and/or LEED points, I use a defined list in a table.  However, the building is being built and will never actually see the weather that was used to define the climate zone.

Better yet ? get rid of defined climate zones altogether when taking a performance path.  Require professionals who do simulation to understand how to open and analyze a climate file and derive the climate zone.  Require review of that process by the AHJ and agreement that the analysis is valid and the CZ selected makes sense for the project.

Nathan,
After you pointed this out, we started exploring this issue and did find significant differences in current weather files and 30 year average/EPW files.
As IBPSA members, we should take this issue up on a national level to come up with a resolution.

To add to the list of tools that already does this for you:

IES VE does this for you in the Vista application.  Whether you?ve run an annual simulation or not, you can plot multiple variables overlaid on one another:

[cid:image005.jpg at 01D04589.45775930]

[cid:image008.jpg at 01D04589.45775930]

?Heat Maps?:

[cid:image011.jpg at 01D04589.45775930]

You can also create your own custom variables in the VE (so you could create an enthalpy variable from the other variables and plot it on a graph or export to a spreadsheet, etc.):

[cid:image012.png at 01D04589.45775930]

This is a .EPW file format from: http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/cfm/weather_data3.cfm/region=4_north_and_central_america_wmo_region_4/country=1_usa/cname=USA
For those of you still tuned in ? a bit of a digression:

Note the values that are errors in June and August (the DB is well below freezing 10 F) ? that?s never happened in the recorded history of the area ? let alone in the timeframe that TMY3 files are comprised of).  The coldest value EVER for the entire state in the month of August is 21 F.  That occurred in Kelliher which is more than 200 miles north of this location.

I?d suggest opening any of the climate files you get and ensuring they aren?t full of invalid data points.  I?ve found far too many of them to be too error-filled to be useful for simulation.  Eden Prairie, MN (still spelled incorrectly on the DOE website ? ?Edin?) is also rife with sub-zero temperatures in May (also never happened in recorded history).  The Portland, OR TMY3 has 114 F days in late October (ditto).  I think you get the idea.

Robert,
Once you get two psychrometric data points of moist air, you should be able to derive the other properties that you desire.  A lot of the hourly weather files just happen to provide humidity in DP.  Obviously if you have more than a few data points to evaluate (like a full TMY3 file), looking them up on a psych chart isn?t very practical.  Unless you?re particularly interested in evaluating partial pressure equations, I would recommend using readily available software as a data filtering tool.  I recommend ClimateConsultant which is a free software produced by UCLA:
http://www.energy-design-tools.aud.ucla.edu/climate-consultant/request-climate-consultant.php

The software can be used for visualizing weather data and evaluating heating and cooling strategies.  It?s great for that, but I often simply use it to filter raw weather files and then export to Excel.  The whole process takes 5 minutes once you have the software installed.  You simply find the appropriate EPW weather file (EnergyPlus format) from the web (link provided in the software) and import it into ClimateConsultant.  You can then export to csv.  I like how the software will automatically convert from SI to IP units.  You can choose other ways of representing humidity like RH and WB.  You can also use it to quickly construct daily or monthly averages if desired.

[cid:image013.png at 01D04589.45775930]

Anyway, that?s my plug for ClimateConsultant for those of us that can?t program good data filters (or are too lazy).  I hope it?s helpful.

These weather files are great, thanks for the info, but I am trying to get wet bulb temperature too, and they do not seem to give wet bulb temperatures.

Any ideas on that, perhaps?

White Box Technologies (WBT), in collaboration with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), has revised the TMY3 weather files to correct inconsistencies in units for illuminances, improve the reporting of Liquid Precipitation, replace all missing records with interpolated or filled values (chiefly for visibility, ceiling height, aerosol optical depth, and albedo), and add a new variable for Present Weather.

Since their release in 2005, the TMY3 weather files covering 1,020 locations in the US and dependencies has become the standard set of weather files for use in computer simulations of solar energy conversion systems and buildings. The intent of this revision is not to redo the fundamental analysis, but correct some known errors and make modest improvements in the reporting of subsidiary climate variables.

The only impact from these corrections and changes are for daylighting simulations that use the illuminance values, and for building simulations that use the liquid precipitation to model green roofs or moisture transport through the building envelope. The added Present Weather variable is not directly used in any simulation program, but allows the DOE-2 BINM files to have correct IRAIN and ISNOW flags, although these two variables are not being used in DOE-2.  Filling in missing data for Visibility, Ceiling Height, etc., should have no impact on the use of the TMY3s, but improves their overall record-keeping.

The revised TMY3 files in their native CSV format have been provided back to NREL and are available here:    http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/1991-2005/tmy3

The revised TMY3 files in EPW and BINM formats are available for free download on the White Box Technologies web site at  http://weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com/wd-TMY3 or by selecting File Type as "TMY3" at http:/weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com/search<http://weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com/search> to search using GoogleEarth. The zip file names are unchanged, but the underlying EPW and DDY files will have the *TYA designation to distinguish them from the previous TMY3 versions.

For a more detailed description and full documentation of the revision,  please see the attached memorandum.

Nathan,

Looks like you have been thinking about a way to improve 
Appendix G. Anyone can submit proposals to improve Appendix 
G using the procedure described on:

https://ashrae.org/standards-research--technology/standards--guidelines/continuous-maintenance

If you do decide to submit a proposal, please think about 
the proposed language carefully and the direct and indirect 
implication of the proposed requirements.

Thanks

Jason

?Kapil,


Speaking on behalf of the Chicago Chapter of IBPSA-USA, we are planning a webinar for later this year on weather data for energy modeling.  We will make an announcement on the BLDG-SIM and IBPSA-USA listservs, as well as our LinkedIn group page:  https://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=5130922&trk=nmp_rec_act_group_photo


And a tip of the hat to Nathan Kegel--he got me thinking about this topic when he spoke to our group last summer and mentioned inconsistencies in weather data files.


Best regards,

Nathan,
After you pointed this out, we started exploring this issue and did find significant differences in current weather files and 30 year average/EPW files.
As IBPSA members, we should take this issue up on a national level to come up with a resolution.

To add to the list of tools that already does this for you:

IES VE does this for you in the Vista application.  Whether you?ve run an annual simulation or not, you can plot multiple variables overlaid on one another:

[cid:image001.jpg at 01D04557.6EF89300]

[cid:image002.jpg at 01D04557.6EF89300]

3D graphs:

?Heat Maps?:

[cid:image006.jpg at 01D04557.6EF89300]

You can also create your own custom variables in the VE (so you could create an enthalpy variable from the other variables and plot it on a graph or export to a spreadsheet, etc.):

[cid:image007.png at 01D04557.6EF89300]

This is a .EPW file format from: http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/cfm/weather_data3.cfm/region=4_north_and_central_america_wmo_region_4/country=1_usa/cname=USA
For those of you still tuned in ? a bit of a digression:

Note the values that are errors in June and August (the DB is well below freezing 10 F) ? that?s never happened in the recorded history of the area ? let alone in the timeframe that TMY3 files are comprised of).  The coldest value EVER for the entire state in the month of August is 21 F.  That occurred in Kelliher which is more than 200 miles north of this location.

I?d suggest opening any of the climate files you get and ensuring they aren?t full of invalid data points.  I?ve found far too many of them to be too error-filled to be useful for simulation.  Eden Prairie, MN (still spelled incorrectly on the DOE website ? ?Edin?) is also rife with sub-zero temperatures in May (also never happened in recorded history).  The Portland, OR TMY3 has 114 F days in late October (ditto).  I think you get the idea.

Robert,
Once you get two psychrometric data points of moist air, you should be able to derive the other properties that you desire.  A lot of the hourly weather files just happen to provide humidity in DP.  Obviously if you have more than a few data points to evaluate (like a full TMY3 file), looking them up on a psych chart isn?t very practical.  Unless you?re particularly interested in evaluating partial pressure equations, I would recommend using readily available software as a data filtering tool.  I recommend ClimateConsultant which is a free software produced by UCLA:
http://www.energy-design-tools.aud.ucla.edu/climate-consultant/request-climate-consultant.php

The software can be used for visualizing weather data and evaluating heating and cooling strategies.  It?s great for that, but I often simply use it to filter raw weather files and then export to Excel.  The whole process takes 5 minutes once you have the software installed.  You simply find the appropriate EPW weather file (EnergyPlus format) from the web (link provided in the software) and import it into ClimateConsultant.  You can then export to csv.  I like how the software will automatically convert from SI to IP units.  You can choose other ways of representing humidity like RH and WB.  You can also use it to quickly construct daily or monthly averages if desired.

[cid:image009.png at 01D04557.6EF89300]

Anyway, that?s my plug for ClimateConsultant for those of us that can?t program good data filters (or are too lazy).  I hope it?s helpful.

These weather files are great, thanks for the info, but I am trying to get wet bulb temperature too, and they do not seem to give wet bulb temperatures.

Any ideas on that, perhaps?

White Box Technologies (WBT), in collaboration with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), has revised the TMY3 weather files to correct inconsistencies in units for illuminances, improve the reporting of Liquid Precipitation, replace all missing records with interpolated or filled values (chiefly for visibility, ceiling height, aerosol optical depth, and albedo), and add a new variable for Present Weather.

Since their release in 2005, the TMY3 weather files covering 1,020 locations in the US and dependencies has become the standard set of weather files for use in computer simulations of solar energy conversion systems and buildings. The intent of this revision is not to redo the fundamental analysis, but correct some known errors and make modest improvements in the reporting of subsidiary climate variables.

The only impact from these corrections and changes are for daylighting simulations that use the illuminance values, and for building simulations that use the liquid precipitation to model green roofs or moisture transport through the building envelope. The added Present Weather variable is not directly used in any simulation program, but allows the DOE-2 BINM files to have correct IRAIN and ISNOW flags, although these two variables are not being used in DOE-2.  Filling in missing data for Visibility, Ceiling Height, etc., should have no impact on the use of the TMY3s, but improves their overall record-keeping.

The revised TMY3 files in their native CSV format have been provided back to NREL and are available here:    http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/1991-2005/tmy3

The revised TMY3 files in EPW and BINM formats are available for free download on the White Box Technologies web site at  http://weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com/wd-TMY3 or by selecting File Type as "TMY3" at http:/weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com/search<http://weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com/search> to search using GoogleEarth. The zip file names are unchanged, but the underlying EPW and DDY files will have the *TYA designation to distinguish them from the previous TMY3 versions.

For a more detailed description and full documentation of the revision,  please see the attached memorandum.

Nathan,

I would encourage you and others interested in this topic to participate in ASHRAE Technical Committee 4.2 Climatic Information. We are always looking for new research (including creating high quality weather files ? we created the IWEC2 and others) and for new members.  Joe Huang and I are members.

If you?re interested, let me know and I can tell you who to contact to get on the committee.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Revised TMY3 Weather Files now available on the Web

Hi Kapil,

Several people have emailed me off the list to express a similar sentiment.  I?ll let them remain anonymous unless they choose to chime in.

Two parts to this email: further exploration of the problems in part 1 and some ideas for solutions in part 2.

Part 1.

I?ve presented on this topic at ASHRAE conferences as well as whenever I do a training on doing LEED or code compliance energy simulation.  I?ve done my own sensitivity analysis of many of the free Minneapolis area climate files and found I can vary the EUI of an office building with a VAV system by 14% just by selecting a different climate file that?s 12 miles away.  Even more interesting (at least to me) was that I could change which design decision was best by changing the climate file.  For example, the MSP climate file resulted in glazing X being the lowest EUI while selecting the Eden Prairie file (12 miles away) resulted in glazing Y being the best.  There?s no micro climates involved and both of these files ?bin out? to CZ6.  However, neither of them are particularly ?representative?.  Eden Prairie has -12 F hours in May while the MSP file has 92 F degree hours in April.  A quick check of the historical records show that -12F has never happened in recorded history in May in the Minneapolis area.  Anyone who lives in Minneapolis can tell you that 90+ in April isn?t common.  Even 70+ in April isn?t that common.  A quick check of the historical record shows one time in nearly 200 years of records where above 90 was recorded before April 15.  The third file, Crystal, was documented as having sub-freezing temps in the summer months in my previous reply to this thread.  So that?s not representative, either.  If there were no other options (which there are), I?d go with MSP as the best of a bad hand of climate files.

Appendix G only requires in G2.3 (90.1-2010): ?The simulation program shall perform the simulation using hourly values of climatic data, such as temperature and humidity from representative climatic data, for the site in which the proposed design is to be located.  For cities or urban regions with several climatic data entries, and for locations where weather data are not available, the designer shall select available weather data that best represent the climate at the construction site.  The selected weather data shall be approved by the rating authority.?

The way this is written, I can literally pick any weather file ? even if it is known to be filled with errors ? and use it for LEED compliance and/or code as long as its nearby my proposed building.  It?s up to the rating authority to question it.

I?ve gotten many LEED review and code review comments in doing simulation.  I?ve never once been asked about the quality of the climate data that was used in the simulation.  Yet it impacts everything in the simulation: envelope, equipment performance (as many equipment performance curves are dependent on ambient conditions), and glazing selection just to name a few.

The mentality of ?plug and chug?, or worse, not even bothering to know which climate file your simulation program is actually using when it spits out results, is a very dangerous game if you?re at all concerned about a reliable result ? and by extension ? providing your customers with sound recommendations on how to spend their money.

While nothing is perfect, I?ve had good experiences with using www.weatheranalytics.com<http://www.weatheranalytics.com> as a source for both TMY and AMY files.  If there?s a problem with a file they create, they?ve been really good about making it right quickly.

Another big problem with the free TMY3 files is they aren?t very up to date (2005 was ten years ago).  Which is another reason why I like weatheranalytics.com ? I can get more up-to-date weather data to help make a more informed decision.

Part 2.

In my opinion, Appendix G needs a new section for compliance: Pre-simulation Climate Analysis (call it Table G3.09).


1.       Perform analysis on at least 1 TMY and 3 AMY (within the last 10 years) climate files near your site.  If three aren?t available, document where you looked and what process was done to select the climate file used in simulation.  (Although with services like Weather Analytics now available, this shouldn?t really be a problem for pretty much any project anywhere).  Submit plots of dry-bulb temperatures and provide a narrative describing the process used in selecting the climate file used in the simulation.  Include metrics like climate zone, bin analysis, and numerical justifications as well as local knowledge from trusted data sets in either the public or private domain.

2.       Document both the ASHRAE defined climate zone from 90.1/169 and perform your own BIN analysis in accordance with ASHRAE methodology for non-defined locations.  Submit both the defined climate zone and the derived climate zone.  If they are different, advise as to which climate zone is being used in the simulation for baseline building generation.

?         Fun facts (using TMY3 data sets): Dallas is defined at CZ 3A, it bins out to 2A.  Nashville is defined as CZ 4A, it bins out to 3A.  Toronto is defined as 6A, it bins out to 4A.  All these are listed in 90.1-2010 which is the referenced standard in LEED v4 as well as an approved compliance path in IECC 2012.  This is another potential design quandary: to get code approval and/or LEED points, I use a defined list in a table.  However, the building is being built and will never actually see the weather that was used to define the climate zone.

Better yet ? get rid of defined climate zones altogether when taking a performance path.  Require professionals who do simulation to understand how to open and analyze a climate file and derive the climate zone.  Require review of that process by the AHJ and agreement that the analysis is valid and the CZ selected makes sense for the project.

Nathan,
After you pointed this out, we started exploring this issue and did find significant differences in current weather files and 30 year average/EPW files.
As IBPSA members, we should take this issue up on a national level to come up with a resolution.

To add to the list of tools that already does this for you:

IES VE does this for you in the Vista application.  Whether you?ve run an annual simulation or not, you can plot multiple variables overlaid on one another:

?Heat Maps?:

[cid:image005.jpg at 01D045E9.FBF972F0]

You can also create your own custom variables in the VE (so you could create an enthalpy variable from the other variables and plot it on a graph or export to a spreadsheet, etc.):

[cid:image006.png at 01D045E9.FBF972F0]

This is a .EPW file format from: http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/cfm/weather_data3.cfm/region=4_north_and_central_america_wmo_region_4/country=1_usa/cname=USA
For those of you still tuned in ? a bit of a digression:

Note the values that are errors in June and August (the DB is well below freezing 10 F) ? that?s never happened in the recorded history of the area ? let alone in the timeframe that TMY3 files are comprised of).  The coldest value EVER for the entire state in the month of August is 21 F.  That occurred in Kelliher which is more than 200 miles north of this location.

I?d suggest opening any of the climate files you get and ensuring they aren?t full of invalid data points.  I?ve found far too many of them to be too error-filled to be useful for simulation.  Eden Prairie, MN (still spelled incorrectly on the DOE website ? ?Edin?) is also rife with sub-zero temperatures in May (also never happened in recorded history).  The Portland, OR TMY3 has 114 F days in late October (ditto).  I think you get the idea.

Robert,
Once you get two psychrometric data points of moist air, you should be able to derive the other properties that you desire.  A lot of the hourly weather files just happen to provide humidity in DP.  Obviously if you have more than a few data points to evaluate (like a full TMY3 file), looking them up on a psych chart isn?t very practical.  Unless you?re particularly interested in evaluating partial pressure equations, I would recommend using readily available software as a data filtering tool.  I recommend ClimateConsultant which is a free software produced by UCLA:
http://www.energy-design-tools.aud.ucla.edu/climate-consultant/request-climate-consultant.php

The software can be used for visualizing weather data and evaluating heating and cooling strategies.  It?s great for that, but I often simply use it to filter raw weather files and then export to Excel.  The whole process takes 5 minutes once you have the software installed.  You simply find the appropriate EPW weather file (EnergyPlus format) from the web (link provided in the software) and import it into ClimateConsultant.  You can then export to csv.  I like how the software will automatically convert from SI to IP units.  You can choose other ways of representing humidity like RH and WB.  You can also use it to quickly construct daily or monthly averages if desired.

[cid:image007.png at 01D045E9.FBF972F0]

Anyway, that?s my plug for ClimateConsultant for those of us that can?t program good data filters (or are too lazy).  I hope it?s helpful.

These weather files are great, thanks for the info, but I am trying to get wet bulb temperature too, and they do not seem to give wet bulb temperatures.

Any ideas on that, perhaps?

White Box Technologies (WBT), in collaboration with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), has revised the TMY3 weather files to correct inconsistencies in units for illuminances, improve the reporting of Liquid Precipitation, replace all missing records with interpolated or filled values (chiefly for visibility, ceiling height, aerosol optical depth, and albedo), and add a new variable for Present Weather.

Since their release in 2005, the TMY3 weather files covering 1,020 locations in the US and dependencies has become the standard set of weather files for use in computer simulations of solar energy conversion systems and buildings. The intent of this revision is not to redo the fundamental analysis, but correct some known errors and make modest improvements in the reporting of subsidiary climate variables.

The only impact from these corrections and changes are for daylighting simulations that use the illuminance values, and for building simulations that use the liquid precipitation to model green roofs or moisture transport through the building envelope. The added Present Weather variable is not directly used in any simulation program, but allows the DOE-2 BINM files to have correct IRAIN and ISNOW flags, although these two variables are not being used in DOE-2.  Filling in missing data for Visibility, Ceiling Height, etc., should have no impact on the use of the TMY3s, but improves their overall record-keeping.

The revised TMY3 files in their native CSV format have been provided back to NREL and are available here:    http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/1991-2005/tmy3

The revised TMY3 files in EPW and BINM formats are available for free download on the White Box Technologies web site at  http://weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com/wd-TMY3 or by selecting File Type as "TMY3" at http:/weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com/search<http://weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com/search> to search using GoogleEarth. The zip file names are unchanged, but the underlying EPW and DDY files will have the *TYA designation to distinguish them from the previous TMY3 versions.

For a more detailed description and full documentation of the revision,  please see the attached memorandum.

To amplify Dru's recommendation to get involved with ASHRAE -- an
additional route would be to develop a weather file quality standard via
the ASHRAE consensus process.  This would specify algorithmic tests applied
to a file.  Then any simulation-based compliance method could specify
"shall use a weather file that conforms to ASHRAE Std XXX."

Many software developers, including me, have developed weather file QC
checkers (half-baked at best in my case).  Getting everyone around one
table and agreeing on exactly what is "good enough" would be very helpful
to the industry.

The standard could be an addendum to Std 169 perhaps (with a suitable
extension of Scope) or a new Standard.  TC 4.2 is the cognizant TC for Std.
169.

Hi Chris and Nick,
For some reason the emails Nick forwarded did not come through properly, 
so perhaps he covered this.  If not, I can say this same question has 
come up in developing compliance software, and an equation is published 
in the 2013 T24 NACM:

Et = Ec ? 0.015  (Where Ec and Et are fractions)

For background, this equation was informed by comparing the thermal and 
combustion efficiencies published for large boilers in the AHRI database.

If there is evidence that using the standard and publicly-available weather files for LEED energy modeling or code compliance results in unreasonable energy performance comparisons, or gives unreliable feedback regarding evaluation of energy conservation measures, than by all means lets support research projects that quantify this, and then determine a path forward. (I suspect this has already been done, but I?m not a weather file expert. I?m not familiar with the IWEC2 format that Dru mentions.) Let?s also support the work of ASHRAE TC 4.2 as Dru suggests. Without research that quantifies weather-file-related impacts on modeling results as a major source of inaccuracy, I?m reluctant to support a new Appendix G requirement for modelers to perform detailed weather/climate analysis.

Seeing Nathan?s email, my devil?s advocate instincts kicked in and I did my own energy modeling test using some Minneapolis area weather files on a project I am working on located in New York State near the St. Lawrence River, which is also Zone 6A. Here are the results of an eQUEST simulation of a 48,000 ft2 office building using the NY weather file and three files from the Minneapolis area (downloaded from doe2.com):
eQUEST simulation of a sample office building Zone 6A

TMY3\MN_St_Paul_Downtown_AP

75.8

This is a sample size of one project, so YMMV. Could I game the system by picking the best weather file? I suppose. Though there is only a 2% difference in energy savings between the extremes of these four weather files. And this is for an exceptional design. Note also that the NY TMY2 file gives baseline results in between the values of the three Minneapolis TMY3 files. Another interesting take-away as that the more energy efficient a building is, the less sensitive it is to weather effects. These numbers seem fairly robust, in an unscientific-eyeballing-no-statistical-analysis way. Again, n=1.

If any particular weather file is error-riddled, shouldn?t that be apparent from the unmet load hours?
It?d be hard to be unaware of which file you are using, or to hide it from a reviewer (at least when using DOE-2/eQUEST) as the weather file name is at the top of every page of the output report.

The game changes when calibrating models to existing utility bills, or for design system sizing. Actual weather data and ASHRAE design temperatures should be considered in these circumstances.

Bill

To amplify Dru's recommendation to get involved with ASHRAE -- an additional route would be to develop a weather file quality standard via the ASHRAE consensus process.  This would specify algorithmic tests applied to a file.  Then any simulation-based compliance method could specify "shall use a weather file that conforms to ASHRAE Std XXX."

Many software developers, including me, have developed weather file QC checkers (half-baked at best in my case).  Getting everyone around one table and agreeing on exactly what is "good enough" would be very helpful to the industry.

The standard could be an addendum to Std 169 perhaps (with a suitable extension of Scope) or a new Standard.  TC 4.2 is the cognizant TC for Std. 169.

I would encourage you and others interested in this topic to participate in ASHRAE Technical Committee 4.2 Climatic Information. We are always looking for new research (including creating high quality weather files ? we created the IWEC2 and others) and for new members.  Joe Huang and I are members.

If you?re interested, let me know and I can tell you who to contact to get on the committee.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Revised TMY3 Weather Files now available on the Web

Hi Kapil,

Several people have emailed me off the list to express a similar sentiment.  I?ll let them remain anonymous unless they choose to chime in.

Two parts to this email: further exploration of the problems in part 1 and some ideas for solutions in part 2.

Part 1.

I?ve presented on this topic at ASHRAE conferences as well as whenever I do a training on doing LEED or code compliance energy simulation.  I?ve done my own sensitivity analysis of many of the free Minneapolis area climate files and found I can vary the EUI of an office building with a VAV system by 14% just by selecting a different climate file that?s 12 miles away.  Even more interesting (at least to me) was that I could change which design decision was best by changing the climate file.  For example, the MSP climate file resulted in glazing X being the lowest EUI while selecting the Eden Prairie file (12 miles away) resulted in glazing Y being the best.  There?s no micro climates involved and both of these files ?bin out? to CZ6.  However, neither of them are particularly ?representative?.  Eden Prairie has -12 F hours in May while the MSP file has 92 F degree hours in April.  A quick check of the historical records show that -12F has never happened in recorded history in May in the Minneapolis area.  Anyone who lives in Minneapolis can tell you that 90+ in April isn?t common.  Even 70+ in April isn?t that common.  A quick check of the historical record shows one time in nearly 200 years of records where above 90 was recorded before April 15.  The third file, Crystal, was documented as having sub-freezing temps in the summer months in my previous reply to this thread.  So that?s not representative, either.  If there were no other options (which there are), I?d go with MSP as the best of a bad hand of climate files.

Appendix G only requires in G2.3 (90.1-2010): ?The simulation program shall perform the simulation using hourly values of climatic data, such as temperature and humidity from representative climatic data, for the site in which the proposed design is to be located.  For cities or urban regions with several climatic data entries, and for locations where weather data are not available, the designer shall select available weather data that best represent the climate at the construction site.  The selected weather data shall be approved by the rating authority.?

The way this is written, I can literally pick any weather file ? even if it is known to be filled with errors ? and use it for LEED compliance and/or code as long as its nearby my proposed building.  It?s up to the rating authority to question it.

I?ve gotten many LEED review and code review comments in doing simulation.  I?ve never once been asked about the quality of the climate data that was used in the simulation.  Yet it impacts everything in the simulation: envelope, equipment performance (as many equipment performance curves are dependent on ambient conditions), and glazing selection just to name a few.

The mentality of ?plug and chug?, or worse, not even bothering to know which climate file your simulation program is actually using when it spits out results, is a very dangerous game if you?re at all concerned about a reliable result ? and by extension ? providing your customers with sound recommendations on how to spend their money.

While nothing is perfect, I?ve had good experiences with using www.weatheranalytics.com<http://www.weatheranalytics.com> as a source for both TMY and AMY files.  If there?s a problem with a file they create, they?ve been really good about making it right quickly.

Another big problem with the free TMY3 files is they aren?t very up to date (2005 was ten years ago).  Which is another reason why I like weatheranalytics.com<http://weatheranalytics.com> ? I can get more up-to-date weather data to help make a more informed decision.

Part 2.

In my opinion, Appendix G needs a new section for compliance: Pre-simulation Climate Analysis (call it Table G3.09).


1.       Perform analysis on at least 1 TMY and 3 AMY (within the last 10 years) climate files near your site.  If three aren?t available, document where you looked and what process was done to select the climate file used in simulation.  (Although with services like Weather Analytics now available, this shouldn?t really be a problem for pretty much any project anywhere).  Submit plots of dry-bulb temperatures and provide a narrative describing the process used in selecting the climate file used in the simulation.  Include metrics like climate zone, bin analysis, and numerical justifications as well as local knowledge from trusted data sets in either the public or private domain.

2.       Document both the ASHRAE defined climate zone from 90.1/169 and perform your own BIN analysis in accordance with ASHRAE methodology for non-defined locations.  Submit both the defined climate zone and the derived climate zone.  If they are different, advise as to which climate zone is being used in the simulation for baseline building generation.

?         Fun facts (using TMY3 data sets): Dallas is defined at CZ 3A, it bins out to 2A.  Nashville is defined as CZ 4A, it bins out to 3A.  Toronto is defined as 6A, it bins out to 4A.  All these are listed in 90.1-2010 which is the referenced standard in LEED v4 as well as an approved compliance path in IECC 2012.  This is another potential design quandary: to get code approval and/or LEED points, I use a defined list in a table.  However, the building is being built and will never actually see the weather that was used to define the climate zone.

Better yet ? get rid of defined climate zones altogether when taking a performance path.  Require professionals who do simulation to understand how to open and analyze a climate file and derive the climate zone.  Require review of that process by the AHJ and agreement that the analysis is valid and the CZ selected makes sense for the project.

After you pointed this out, we started exploring this issue and did find significant differences in current weather files and 30 year average/EPW files.
As IBPSA members, we should take this issue up on a national level to come up with a resolution.

To add to the list of tools that already does this for you:

IES VE does this for you in the Vista application.  Whether you?ve run an annual simulation or not, you can plot multiple variables overlaid on one another:

[cid:image012.jpg at 01D045FB.6E3ACEC0]

[cid:image013.jpg at 01D045FB.6E3ACEC0]

[cid:image014.jpg at 01D045FB.6E3ACEC0]

?Heat Maps?:

[cid:image015.jpg at 01D045FB.6E3ACEC0]

You can also create your own custom variables in the VE (so you could create an enthalpy variable from the other variables and plot it on a graph or export to a spreadsheet, etc.):

[cid:image016.png at 01D045FB.6E3ACEC0]

This is a .EPW file format from: http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/cfm/weather_data3.cfm/region=4_north_and_central_america_wmo_region_4/country=1_usa/cname=USA
For those of you still tuned in ? a bit of a digression:

Note the values that are errors in June and August (the DB is well below freezing 10 F) ? that?s never happened in the recorded history of the area ? let alone in the timeframe that TMY3 files are comprised of).  The coldest value EVER for the entire state in the month of August is 21 F.  That occurred in Kelliher which is more than 200 miles north of this location.

I?d suggest opening any of the climate files you get and ensuring they aren?t full of invalid data points.  I?ve found far too many of them to be too error-filled to be useful for simulation.  Eden Prairie, MN (still spelled incorrectly on the DOE website ? ?Edin?) is also rife with sub-zero temperatures in May (also never happened in recorded history).  The Portland, OR TMY3 has 114 F days in late October (ditto).  I think you get the idea.

Robert,
Once you get two psychrometric data points of moist air, you should be able to derive the other properties that you desire.  A lot of the hourly weather files just happen to provide humidity in DP.  Obviously if you have more than a few data points to evaluate (like a full TMY3 file), looking them up on a psych chart isn?t very practical.  Unless you?re particularly interested in evaluating partial pressure equations, I would recommend using readily available software as a data filtering tool.  I recommend ClimateConsultant which is a free software produced by UCLA:
http://www.energy-design-tools.aud.ucla.edu/climate-consultant/request-climate-consultant.php

The software can be used for visualizing weather data and evaluating heating and cooling strategies.  It?s great for that, but I often simply use it to filter raw weather files and then export to Excel.  The whole process takes 5 minutes once you have the software installed.  You simply find the appropriate EPW weather file (EnergyPlus format) from the web (link provided in the software) and import it into ClimateConsultant.  You can then export to csv.  I like how the software will automatically convert from SI to IP units.  You can choose other ways of representing humidity like RH and WB.  You can also use it to quickly construct daily or monthly averages if desired.

[cid:image017.png at 01D045FB.6E3ACEC0]

Anyway, that?s my plug for ClimateConsultant for those of us that can?t program good data filters (or are too lazy).  I hope it?s helpful.

These weather files are great, thanks for the info, but I am trying to get wet bulb temperature too, and they do not seem to give wet bulb temperatures.

Any ideas on that, perhaps?

White Box Technologies (WBT), in collaboration with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), has revised the TMY3 weather files to correct inconsistencies in units for illuminances, improve the reporting of Liquid Precipitation, replace all missing records with interpolated or filled values (chiefly for visibility, ceiling height, aerosol optical depth, and albedo), and add a new variable for Present Weather.

Since their release in 2005, the TMY3 weather files covering 1,020 locations in the US and dependencies has become the standard set of weather files for use in computer simulations of solar energy conversion systems and buildings. The intent of this revision is not to redo the fundamental analysis, but correct some known errors and make modest improvements in the reporting of subsidiary climate variables.

The only impact from these corrections and changes are for daylighting simulations that use the illuminance values, and for building simulations that use the liquid precipitation to model green roofs or moisture transport through the building envelope. The added Present Weather variable is not directly used in any simulation program, but allows the DOE-2 BINM files to have correct IRAIN and ISNOW flags, although these two variables are not being used in DOE-2.  Filling in missing data for Visibility, Ceiling Height, etc., should have no impact on the use of the TMY3s, but improves their overall record-keeping.

The revised TMY3 files in their native CSV format have been provided back to NREL and are available here:    http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/1991-2005/tmy3

The revised TMY3 files in EPW and BINM formats are available for free download on the White Box Technologies web site at  http://weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com/wd-TMY3 or by selecting File Type as "TMY3" at http:/weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com/search<http://weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com/search> to search using GoogleEarth. The zip file names are unchanged, but the underlying EPW and DDY files will have the *TYA designation to distinguish them from the previous TMY3 versions.

For a more detailed description and full documentation of the revision,  please see the attached memorandum.

Hi Bill,

You missed the Eden Prairie file which is the one that causes the most variation in EUI as it?s the most extreme.  Below is a graph showing 3 different climate files for a 120,000 SF office in Minneapolis with loads of glass (it?s a LEED Gold building FWIW).

[cid:image002.jpg at 01D045F6.1A42C840]

Since there?s a lot of glass on this project, you can also see the impact of changing glass type as well.  Similar colors use the same glass and vary the climate file.  The TMY7 file is one that was purchased from Weather Analytics and contains the most reasonable climate data I could find at the time.  I used IES VE for this analysis for a variety of reasons including system type, details of the solar model, and ability to plot data from the climate files to ensure it wasn?t going to be GIGO.

Your note on unmet hours would have a varying impact in providing insight into this depending how the systems are sized in the tool you?re using.  My guess is the baseline would have unmet hours in it but the proposed would not given that most proposed buildings are sized with more extreme values than in the climate files and we input the actual equipment sizes into the proposed building as opposed to the baseline building.

If there is evidence that using the standard and publicly-available weather files for LEED energy modeling or code compliance results in unreasonable energy performance comparisons, or gives unreliable feedback regarding evaluation of energy conservation measures, than by all means lets support research projects that quantify this, and then determine a path forward. (I suspect this has already been done, but I?m not a weather file expert. I?m not familiar with the IWEC2 format that Dru mentions.) Let?s also support the work of ASHRAE TC 4.2 as Dru suggests. Without research that quantifies weather-file-related impacts on modeling results as a major source of inaccuracy, I?m reluctant to support a new Appendix G requirement for modelers to perform detailed weather/climate analysis.

Seeing Nathan?s email, my devil?s advocate instincts kicked in and I did my own energy modeling test using some Minneapolis area weather files on a project I am working on located in New York State near the St. Lawrence River, which is also Zone 6A. Here are the results of an eQUEST simulation of a 48,000 ft2 office building using the NY weather file and three files from the Minneapolis area (downloaded from doe2.com):

This is a sample size of one project, so YMMV. Could I game the system by picking the best weather file? I suppose. Though there is only a 2% difference in energy savings between the extremes of these four weather files. And this is for an exceptional design. Note also that the NY TMY2 file gives baseline results in between the values of the three Minneapolis TMY3 files. Another interesting take-away as that the more energy efficient a building is, the less sensitive it is to weather effects. These numbers seem fairly robust, in an unscientific-eyeballing-no-statistical-analysis way. Again, n=1.

If any particular weather file is error-riddled, shouldn?t that be apparent from the unmet load hours?
It?d be hard to be unaware of which file you are using, or to hide it from a reviewer (at least when using DOE-2/eQUEST) as the weather file name is at the top of every page of the output report.

The game changes when calibrating models to existing utility bills, or for design system sizing. Actual weather data and ASHRAE design temperatures should be considered in these circumstances.

To amplify Dru's recommendation to get involved with ASHRAE -- an additional route would be to develop a weather file quality standard via the ASHRAE consensus process.  This would specify algorithmic tests applied to a file.  Then any simulation-based compliance method could specify "shall use a weather file that conforms to ASHRAE Std XXX."

Many software developers, including me, have developed weather file QC checkers (half-baked at best in my case).  Getting everyone around one table and agreeing on exactly what is "good enough" would be very helpful to the industry.

The standard could be an addendum to Std 169 perhaps (with a suitable extension of Scope) or a new Standard.  TC 4.2 is the cognizant TC for Std. 169.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Revised TMY3 Weather Files now available on the Web

Hi Kapil,

Several people have emailed me off the list to express a similar sentiment.  I?ll let them remain anonymous unless they choose to chime in.

Two parts to this email: further exploration of the problems in part 1 and some ideas for solutions in part 2.

Part 1.

I?ve presented on this topic at ASHRAE conferences as well as whenever I do a training on doing LEED or code compliance energy simulation.  I?ve done my own sensitivity analysis of many of the free Minneapolis area climate files and found I can vary the EUI of an office building with a VAV system by 14% just by selecting a different climate file that?s 12 miles away.  Even more interesting (at least to me) was that I could change which design decision was best by changing the climate file.  For example, the MSP climate file resulted in glazing X being the lowest EUI while selecting the Eden Prairie file (12 miles away) resulted in glazing Y being the best.  There?s no micro climates involved and both of these files ?bin out? to CZ6.  However, neither of them are particularly ?representative?.  Eden Prairie has -12 F hours in May while the MSP file has 92 F degree hours in April.  A quick check of the historical records show that -12F has never happened in recorded history in May in the Minneapolis area.  Anyone who lives in Minneapolis can tell you that 90+ in April isn?t common.  Even 70+ in April isn?t that common.  A quick check of the historical record shows one time in nearly 200 years of records where above 90 was recorded before April 15.  The third file, Crystal, was documented as having sub-freezing temps in the summer months in my previous reply to this thread.  So that?s not representative, either.  If there were no other options (which there are), I?d go with MSP as the best of a bad hand of climate files.

Appendix G only requires in G2.3 (90.1-2010): ?The simulation program shall perform the simulation using hourly values of climatic data, such as temperature and humidity from representative climatic data, for the site in which the proposed design is to be located.  For cities or urban regions with several climatic data entries, and for locations where weather data are not available, the designer shall select available weather data that best represent the climate at the construction site.  The selected weather data shall be approved by the rating authority.?

The way this is written, I can literally pick any weather file ? even if it is known to be filled with errors ? and use it for LEED compliance and/or code as long as its nearby my proposed building.  It?s up to the rating authority to question it.

I?ve gotten many LEED review and code review comments in doing simulation.  I?ve never once been asked about the quality of the climate data that was used in the simulation.  Yet it impacts everything in the simulation: envelope, equipment performance (as many equipment performance curves are dependent on ambient conditions), and glazing selection just to name a few.

The mentality of ?plug and chug?, or worse, not even bothering to know which climate file your simulation program is actually using when it spits out results, is a very dangerous game if you?re at all concerned about a reliable result ? and by extension ? providing your customers with sound recommendations on how to spend their money.

While nothing is perfect, I?ve had good experiences with using www.weatheranalytics.com<http://www.weatheranalytics.com> as a source for both TMY and AMY files.  If there?s a problem with a file they create, they?ve been really good about making it right quickly.

Another big problem with the free TMY3 files is they aren?t very up to date (2005 was ten years ago).  Which is another reason why I like weatheranalytics.com<http://weatheranalytics.com> ? I can get more up-to-date weather data to help make a more informed decision.

Part 2.

In my opinion, Appendix G needs a new section for compliance: Pre-simulation Climate Analysis (call it Table G3.09).


1.       Perform analysis on at least 1 TMY and 3 AMY (within the last 10 years) climate files near your site.  If three aren?t available, document where you looked and what process was done to select the climate file used in simulation.  (Although with services like Weather Analytics now available, this shouldn?t really be a problem for pretty much any project anywhere).  Submit plots of dry-bulb temperatures and provide a narrative describing the process used in selecting the climate file used in the simulation.  Include metrics like climate zone, bin analysis, and numerical justifications as well as local knowledge from trusted data sets in either the public or private domain.

2.       Document both the ASHRAE defined climate zone from 90.1/169 and perform your own BIN analysis in accordance with ASHRAE methodology for non-defined locations.  Submit both the defined climate zone and the derived climate zone.  If they are different, advise as to which climate zone is being used in the simulation for baseline building generation.

?         Fun facts (using TMY3 data sets): Dallas is defined at CZ 3A, it bins out to 2A.  Nashville is defined as CZ 4A, it bins out to 3A.  Toronto is defined as 6A, it bins out to 4A.  All these are listed in 90.1-2010 which is the referenced standard in LEED v4 as well as an approved compliance path in IECC 2012.  This is another potential design quandary: to get code approval and/or LEED points, I use a defined list in a table.  However, the building is being built and will never actually see the weather that was used to define the climate zone.

Better yet ? get rid of defined climate zones altogether when taking a performance path.  Require professionals who do simulation to understand how to open and analyze a climate file and derive the climate zone.  Require review of that process by the AHJ and agreement that the analysis is valid and the CZ selected makes sense for the project.

Nathan,
After you pointed this out, we started exploring this issue and did find significant differences in current weather files and 30 year average/EPW files.
As IBPSA members, we should take this issue up on a national level to come up with a resolution.

To add to the list of tools that already does this for you:

IES VE does this for you in the Vista application.  Whether you?ve run an annual simulation or not, you can plot multiple variables overlaid on one another:

?Heat Maps?:

[cid:image008.jpg at 01D045F4.6B1E77C0]

You can also create your own custom variables in the VE (so you could create an enthalpy variable from the other variables and plot it on a graph or export to a spreadsheet, etc.):

[cid:image009.png at 01D045F4.6B1E77C0]

This is a .EPW file format from: http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/cfm/weather_data3.cfm/region=4_north_and_central_america_wmo_region_4/country=1_usa/cname=USA
For those of you still tuned in ? a bit of a digression:

Note the values that are errors in June and August (the DB is well below freezing 10 F) ? that?s never happened in the recorded history of the area ? let alone in the timeframe that TMY3 files are comprised of).  The coldest value EVER for the entire state in the month of August is 21 F.  That occurred in Kelliher which is more than 200 miles north of this location.

I?d suggest opening any of the climate files you get and ensuring they aren?t full of invalid data points.  I?ve found far too many of them to be too error-filled to be useful for simulation.  Eden Prairie, MN (still spelled incorrectly on the DOE website ? ?Edin?) is also rife with sub-zero temperatures in May (also never happened in recorded history).  The Portland, OR TMY3 has 114 F days in late October (ditto).  I think you get the idea.

Robert,
Once you get two psychrometric data points of moist air, you should be able to derive the other properties that you desire.  A lot of the hourly weather files just happen to provide humidity in DP.  Obviously if you have more than a few data points to evaluate (like a full TMY3 file), looking them up on a psych chart isn?t very practical.  Unless you?re particularly interested in evaluating partial pressure equations, I would recommend using readily available software as a data filtering tool.  I recommend ClimateConsultant which is a free software produced by UCLA:
http://www.energy-design-tools.aud.ucla.edu/climate-consultant/request-climate-consultant.php

The software can be used for visualizing weather data and evaluating heating and cooling strategies.  It?s great for that, but I often simply use it to filter raw weather files and then export to Excel.  The whole process takes 5 minutes once you have the software installed.  You simply find the appropriate EPW weather file (EnergyPlus format) from the web (link provided in the software) and import it into ClimateConsultant.  You can then export to csv.  I like how the software will automatically convert from SI to IP units.  You can choose other ways of representing humidity like RH and WB.  You can also use it to quickly construct daily or monthly averages if desired.

[cid:image010.png at 01D045F4.6B1E77C0]

Anyway, that?s my plug for ClimateConsultant for those of us that can?t program good data filters (or are too lazy).  I hope it?s helpful.

These weather files are great, thanks for the info, but I am trying to get wet bulb temperature too, and they do not seem to give wet bulb temperatures.

Any ideas on that, perhaps?

White Box Technologies (WBT), in collaboration with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), has revised the TMY3 weather files to correct inconsistencies in units for illuminances, improve the reporting of Liquid Precipitation, replace all missing records with interpolated or filled values (chiefly for visibility, ceiling height, aerosol optical depth, and albedo), and add a new variable for Present Weather.

Since their release in 2005, the TMY3 weather files covering 1,020 locations in the US and dependencies has become the standard set of weather files for use in computer simulations of solar energy conversion systems and buildings. The intent of this revision is not to redo the fundamental analysis, but correct some known errors and make modest improvements in the reporting of subsidiary climate variables.

The only impact from these corrections and changes are for daylighting simulations that use the illuminance values, and for building simulations that use the liquid precipitation to model green roofs or moisture transport through the building envelope. The added Present Weather variable is not directly used in any simulation program, but allows the DOE-2 BINM files to have correct IRAIN and ISNOW flags, although these two variables are not being used in DOE-2.  Filling in missing data for Visibility, Ceiling Height, etc., should have no impact on the use of the TMY3s, but improves their overall record-keeping.

The revised TMY3 files in their native CSV format have been provided back to NREL and are available here:    http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/1991-2005/tmy3

The revised TMY3 files in EPW and BINM formats are available for free download on the White Box Technologies web site at  http://weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com/wd-TMY3 or by selecting File Type as "TMY3" at http:/weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com/search<http://weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com/search> to search using GoogleEarth. The zip file names are unchanged, but the underlying EPW and DDY files will have the *TYA designation to distinguish them from the previous TMY3 versions.

For a more detailed description and full documentation of the revision,  please see the attached memorandum.

Hi Nathan,
I couldn?t find an Eden Prairie file at doe2.com in the TMY, TMY2 or TMY3 format. I also don?t see one at the links that Joe Huang forwarded on 1/30.
Using your graph, wouldn?t you make similar recommendations, regardless of the weather file used? Option 2 is better than Option 1. Options 3 and 4 are a close tie for best choice. As long as you are comparing options (proposed to baseline, glazing 1 to glazing 2 etc.) you should see similar comparative performance as long as you don?t switch weather files mid-stream. Granted, energy modeling results due to differences between weather files will be most pronounced for buildings dominated by envelope or ventilation loads, and you show why running different files can be a useful exercise.
Trying to predict the exact EUI of a new design, or replicate the performance of an existing building, are two things that are very challenging with energy modeling programs at this time. A ?perfect? weather file still only represents one year of conditions. I can see how challenging it must be to develop the format for a ?Typical Meteorological Year?.

Best regards,
Bill

Hi Bill,

You missed the Eden Prairie file which is the one that causes the most variation in EUI as it?s the most extreme.  Below is a graph showing 3 different climate files for a 120,000 SF office in Minneapolis with loads of glass (it?s a LEED Gold building FWIW).

[cid:image019.jpg at 01D04600.7F148560]

Since there?s a lot of glass on this project, you can also see the impact of changing glass type as well.  Similar colors use the same glass and vary the climate file.  The TMY7 file is one that was purchased from Weather Analytics and contains the most reasonable climate data I could find at the time.  I used IES VE for this analysis for a variety of reasons including system type, details of the solar model, and ability to plot data from the climate files to ensure it wasn?t going to be GIGO.

Your note on unmet hours would have a varying impact in providing insight into this depending how the systems are sized in the tool you?re using.  My guess is the baseline would have unmet hours in it but the proposed would not given that most proposed buildings are sized with more extreme values than in the climate files and we input the actual equipment sizes into the proposed building as opposed to the baseline building.

If there is evidence that using the standard and publicly-available weather files for LEED energy modeling or code compliance results in unreasonable energy performance comparisons, or gives unreliable feedback regarding evaluation of energy conservation measures, than by all means lets support research projects that quantify this, and then determine a path forward. (I suspect this has already been done, but I?m not a weather file expert. I?m not familiar with the IWEC2 format that Dru mentions.) Let?s also support the work of ASHRAE TC 4.2 as Dru suggests. Without research that quantifies weather-file-related impacts on modeling results as a major source of inaccuracy, I?m reluctant to support a new Appendix G requirement for modelers to perform detailed weather/climate analysis.

Seeing Nathan?s email, my devil?s advocate instincts kicked in and I did my own energy modeling test using some Minneapolis area weather files on a project I am working on located in New York State near the St. Lawrence River, which is also Zone 6A. Here are the results of an eQUEST simulation of a 48,000 ft2 office building using the NY weather file and three files from the Minneapolis area (downloaded from doe2.com):

This is a sample size of one project, so YMMV. Could I game the system by picking the best weather file? I suppose. Though there is only a 2% difference in energy savings between the extremes of these four weather files. And this is for an exceptional design. Note also that the NY TMY2 file gives baseline results in between the values of the three Minneapolis TMY3 files. Another interesting take-away as that the more energy efficient a building is, the less sensitive it is to weather effects. These numbers seem fairly robust, in an unscientific-eyeballing-no-statistical-analysis way. Again, n=1.

If any particular weather file is error-riddled, shouldn?t that be apparent from the unmet load hours?
It?d be hard to be unaware of which file you are using, or to hide it from a reviewer (at least when using DOE-2/eQUEST) as the weather file name is at the top of every page of the output report.

The game changes when calibrating models to existing utility bills, or for design system sizing. Actual weather data and ASHRAE design temperatures should be considered in these circumstances.

To amplify Dru's recommendation to get involved with ASHRAE -- an additional route would be to develop a weather file quality standard via the ASHRAE consensus process.  This would specify algorithmic tests applied to a file.  Then any simulation-based compliance method could specify "shall use a weather file that conforms to ASHRAE Std XXX."

Many software developers, including me, have developed weather file QC checkers (half-baked at best in my case).  Getting everyone around one table and agreeing on exactly what is "good enough" would be very helpful to the industry.

The standard could be an addendum to Std 169 perhaps (with a suitable extension of Scope) or a new Standard.  TC 4.2 is the cognizant TC for Std. 169.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Revised TMY3 Weather Files now available on the Web

Hi Kapil,

Several people have emailed me off the list to express a similar sentiment.  I?ll let them remain anonymous unless they choose to chime in.

Two parts to this email: further exploration of the problems in part 1 and some ideas for solutions in part 2.

Part 1.

I?ve presented on this topic at ASHRAE conferences as well as whenever I do a training on doing LEED or code compliance energy simulation.  I?ve done my own sensitivity analysis of many of the free Minneapolis area climate files and found I can vary the EUI of an office building with a VAV system by 14% just by selecting a different climate file that?s 12 miles away.  Even more interesting (at least to me) was that I could change which design decision was best by changing the climate file.  For example, the MSP climate file resulted in glazing X being the lowest EUI while selecting the Eden Prairie file (12 miles away) resulted in glazing Y being the best.  There?s no micro climates involved and both of these files ?bin out? to CZ6.  However, neither of them are particularly ?representative?.  Eden Prairie has -12 F hours in May while the MSP file has 92 F degree hours in April.  A quick check of the historical records show that -12F has never happened in recorded history in May in the Minneapolis area.  Anyone who lives in Minneapolis can tell you that 90+ in April isn?t common.  Even 70+ in April isn?t that common.  A quick check of the historical record shows one time in nearly 200 years of records where above 90 was recorded before April 15.  The third file, Crystal, was documented as having sub-freezing temps in the summer months in my previous reply to this thread.  So that?s not representative, either.  If there were no other options (which there are), I?d go with MSP as the best of a bad hand of climate files.

Appendix G only requires in G2.3 (90.1-2010): ?The simulation program shall perform the simulation using hourly values of climatic data, such as temperature and humidity from representative climatic data, for the site in which the proposed design is to be located.  For cities or urban regions with several climatic data entries, and for locations where weather data are not available, the designer shall select available weather data that best represent the climate at the construction site.  The selected weather data shall be approved by the rating authority.?

The way this is written, I can literally pick any weather file ? even if it is known to be filled with errors ? and use it for LEED compliance and/or code as long as its nearby my proposed building.  It?s up to the rating authority to question it.

I?ve gotten many LEED review and code review comments in doing simulation.  I?ve never once been asked about the quality of the climate data that was used in the simulation.  Yet it impacts everything in the simulation: envelope, equipment performance (as many equipment performance curves are dependent on ambient conditions), and glazing selection just to name a few.

The mentality of ?plug and chug?, or worse, not even bothering to know which climate file your simulation program is actually using when it spits out results, is a very dangerous game if you?re at all concerned about a reliable result ? and by extension ? providing your customers with sound recommendations on how to spend their money.

While nothing is perfect, I?ve had good experiences with using www.weatheranalytics.com<http://www.weatheranalytics.com> as a source for both TMY and AMY files.  If there?s a problem with a file they create, they?ve been really good about making it right quickly.

Another big problem with the free TMY3 files is they aren?t very up to date (2005 was ten years ago).  Which is another reason why I like weatheranalytics.com<http://weatheranalytics.com> ? I can get more up-to-date weather data to help make a more informed decision.

Part 2.

In my opinion, Appendix G needs a new section for compliance: Pre-simulation Climate Analysis (call it Table G3.09).


1.       Perform analysis on at least 1 TMY and 3 AMY (within the last 10 years) climate files near your site.  If three aren?t available, document where you looked and what process was done to select the climate file used in simulation.  (Although with services like Weather Analytics now available, this shouldn?t really be a problem for pretty much any project anywhere).  Submit plots of dry-bulb temperatures and provide a narrative describing the process used in selecting the climate file used in the simulation.  Include metrics like climate zone, bin analysis, and numerical justifications as well as local knowledge from trusted data sets in either the public or private domain.

2.       Document both the ASHRAE defined climate zone from 90.1/169 and perform your own BIN analysis in accordance with ASHRAE methodology for non-defined locations.  Submit both the defined climate zone and the derived climate zone.  If they are different, advise as to which climate zone is being used in the simulation for baseline building generation.

?         Fun facts (using TMY3 data sets): Dallas is defined at CZ 3A, it bins out to 2A.  Nashville is defined as CZ 4A, it bins out to 3A.  Toronto is defined as 6A, it bins out to 4A.  All these are listed in 90.1-2010 which is the referenced standard in LEED v4 as well as an approved compliance path in IECC 2012.  This is another potential design quandary: to get code approval and/or LEED points, I use a defined list in a table.  However, the building is being built and will never actually see the weather that was used to define the climate zone.

Better yet ? get rid of defined climate zones altogether when taking a performance path.  Require professionals who do simulation to understand how to open and analyze a climate file and derive the climate zone.  Require review of that process by the AHJ and agreement that the analysis is valid and the CZ selected makes sense for the project.

After you pointed this out, we started exploring this issue and did find significant differences in current weather files and 30 year average/EPW files.
As IBPSA members, we should take this issue up on a national level to come up with a resolution.

To add to the list of tools that already does this for you:

IES VE does this for you in the Vista application.  Whether you?ve run an annual simulation or not, you can plot multiple variables overlaid on one another:

You can also create your own custom variables in the VE (so you could create an enthalpy variable from the other variables and plot it on a graph or export to a spreadsheet, etc.):

[cid:image009.png at 01D045F4.6B1E77C0]

This is a .EPW file format from: http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/cfm/weather_data3.cfm/region=4_north_and_central_america_wmo_region_4/country=1_usa/cname=USA
For those of you still tuned in ? a bit of a digression:

Note the values that are errors in June and August (the DB is well below freezing 10 F) ? that?s never happened in the recorded history of the area ? let alone in the timeframe that TMY3 files are comprised of).  The coldest value EVER for the entire state in the month of August is 21 F.  That occurred in Kelliher which is more than 200 miles north of this location.

I?d suggest opening any of the climate files you get and ensuring they aren?t full of invalid data points.  I?ve found far too many of them to be too error-filled to be useful for simulation.  Eden Prairie, MN (still spelled incorrectly on the DOE website ? ?Edin?) is also rife with sub-zero temperatures in May (also never happened in recorded history).  The Portland, OR TMY3 has 114 F days in late October (ditto).  I think you get the idea.

Robert,
Once you get two psychrometric data points of moist air, you should be able to derive the other properties that you desire.  A lot of the hourly weather files just happen to provide humidity in DP.  Obviously if you have more than a few data points to evaluate (like a full TMY3 file), looking them up on a psych chart isn?t very practical.  Unless you?re particularly interested in evaluating partial pressure equations, I would recommend using readily available software as a data filtering tool.  I recommend ClimateConsultant which is a free software produced by UCLA:
http://www.energy-design-tools.aud.ucla.edu/climate-consultant/request-climate-consultant.php

The software can be used for visualizing weather data and evaluating heating and cooling strategies.  It?s great for that, but I often simply use it to filter raw weather files and then export to Excel.  The whole process takes 5 minutes once you have the software installed.  You simply find the appropriate EPW weather file (EnergyPlus format) from the web (link provided in the software) and import it into ClimateConsultant.  You can then export to csv.  I like how the software will automatically convert from SI to IP units.  You can choose other ways of representing humidity like RH and WB.  You can also use it to quickly construct daily or monthly averages if desired.

[cid:image010.png at 01D045F4.6B1E77C0]

Anyway, that?s my plug for ClimateConsultant for those of us that can?t program good data filters (or are too lazy).  I hope it?s helpful.

White Box Technologies (WBT), in collaboration with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), has revised the TMY3 weather files to correct inconsistencies in units for illuminances, improve the reporting of Liquid Precipitation, replace all missing records with interpolated or filled values (chiefly for visibility, ceiling height, aerosol optical depth, and albedo), and add a new variable for Present Weather.

Since their release in 2005, the TMY3 weather files covering 1,020 locations in the US and dependencies has become the standard set of weather files for use in computer simulations of solar energy conversion systems and buildings. The intent of this revision is not to redo the fundamental analysis, but correct some known errors and make modest improvements in the reporting of subsidiary climate variables.

The only impact from these corrections and changes are for daylighting simulations that use the illuminance values, and for building simulations that use the liquid precipitation to model green roofs or moisture transport through the building envelope. The added Present Weather variable is not directly used in any simulation program, but allows the DOE-2 BINM files to have correct IRAIN and ISNOW flags, although these two variables are not being used in DOE-2.  Filling in missing data for Visibility, Ceiling Height, etc., should have no impact on the use of the TMY3s, but improves their overall record-keeping.

The revised TMY3 files in their native CSV format have been provided back to NREL and are available here:    http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/1991-2005/tmy3

The revised TMY3 files in EPW and BINM formats are available for free download on the White Box Technologies web site at  http://weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com/wd-TMY3 or by selecting File Type as "TMY3" at http:/weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com/search<http://weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com/search> to search using GoogleEarth. The zip file names are unchanged, but the underlying EPW and DDY files will have the *TYA designation to distinguish them from the previous TMY3 versions.

I just opened up a couple of the CSV files of the TMY3 data sets and found exactly what I suspected: the TMY3 data reports the incorrect values.  So the errors aren?t in the conversions from TMY3 to EPW.  It?s a problem with the raw data.

Hi Nathan,
I couldn?t find an Eden Prairie file at doe2.com in the TMY, TMY2 or TMY3 format. I also don?t see one at the links that Joe Huang forwarded on 1/30.
Using your graph, wouldn?t you make similar recommendations, regardless of the weather file used? Option 2 is better than Option 1. Options 3 and 4 are a close tie for best choice. As long as you are comparing options (proposed to baseline, glazing 1 to glazing 2 etc.) you should see similar comparative performance as long as you don?t switch weather files mid-stream. Granted, energy modeling results due to differences between weather files will be most pronounced for buildings dominated by envelope or ventilation loads, and you show why running different files can be a useful exercise.
Trying to predict the exact EUI of a new design, or replicate the performance of an existing building, are two things that are very challenging with energy modeling programs at this time. A ?perfect? weather file still only represents one year of conditions. I can see how challenging it must be to develop the format for a ?Typical Meteorological Year?.

Best regards,
Bill

Hi Bill,

You missed the Eden Prairie file which is the one that causes the most variation in EUI as it?s the most extreme.  Below is a graph showing 3 different climate files for a 120,000 SF office in Minneapolis with loads of glass (it?s a LEED Gold building FWIW).



Since there?s a lot of glass on this project, you can also see the impact of changing glass type as well.  Similar colors use the same glass and vary the climate file.  The TMY7 file is one that was purchased from Weather Analytics and contains the most reasonable climate data I could find at the time.  I used IES VE for this analysis for a variety of reasons including system type, details of the solar model, and ability to plot data from the climate files to ensure it wasn?t going to be GIGO.

Your note on unmet hours would have a varying impact in providing insight into this depending how the systems are sized in the tool you?re using.  My guess is the baseline would have unmet hours in it but the proposed would not given that most proposed buildings are sized with more extreme values than in the climate files and we input the actual equipment sizes into the proposed building as opposed to the baseline building.

If there is evidence that using the standard and publicly-available weather files for LEED energy modeling or code compliance results in unreasonable energy performance comparisons, or gives unreliable feedback regarding evaluation of energy conservation measures, than by all means lets support research projects that quantify this, and then determine a path forward. (I suspect this has already been done, but I?m not a weather file expert. I?m not familiar with the IWEC2 format that Dru mentions.) Let?s also support the work of ASHRAE TC 4.2 as Dru suggests. Without research that quantifies weather-file-related impacts on modeling results as a major source of inaccuracy, I?m reluctant to support a new Appendix G requirement for modelers to perform detailed weather/climate analysis.

Seeing Nathan?s email, my devil?s advocate instincts kicked in and I did my own energy modeling test using some Minneapolis area weather files on a project I am working on located in New York State near the St. Lawrence River, which is also Zone 6A. Here are the results of an eQUEST simulation of a 48,000 ft2 office building using the NY weather file and three files from the Minneapolis area (downloaded from doe2.com):

eQUEST simulation of a sample office building Zone 6A

This is a sample size of one project, so YMMV. Could I game the system by picking the best weather file? I suppose. Though there is only a 2% difference in energy savings between the extremes of these four weather files. And this is for an exceptional design. Note also that the NY TMY2 file gives baseline results in between the values of the three Minneapolis TMY3 files. Another interesting take-away as that the more energy efficient a building is, the less sensitive it is to weather effects. These numbers seem fairly robust, in an unscientific-eyeballing-no-statistical-analysis way. Again, n=1.

If any particular weather file is error-riddled, shouldn?t that be apparent from the unmet load hours?
It?d be hard to be unaware of which file you are using, or to hide it from a reviewer (at least when using DOE-2/eQUEST) as the weather file name is at the top of every page of the output report.

The game changes when calibrating models to existing utility bills, or for design system sizing. Actual weather data and ASHRAE design temperatures should be considered in these circumstances.

To amplify Dru's recommendation to get involved with ASHRAE -- an additional route would be to develop a weather file quality standard via the ASHRAE consensus process.  This would specify algorithmic tests applied to a file.  Then any simulation-based compliance method could specify "shall use a weather file that conforms to ASHRAE Std XXX."

Many software developers, including me, have developed weather file QC checkers (half-baked at best in my case).  Getting everyone around one table and agreeing on exactly what is "good enough" would be very helpful to the industry.

The standard could be an addendum to Std 169 perhaps (with a suitable extension of Scope) or a new Standard.  TC 4.2 is the cognizant TC for Std. 169.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Revised TMY3 Weather Files now available on the Web

Hi Kapil,

Several people have emailed me off the list to express a similar sentiment.  I?ll let them remain anonymous unless they choose to chime in.

Two parts to this email: further exploration of the problems in part 1 and some ideas for solutions in part 2.

Part 1.

I?ve presented on this topic at ASHRAE conferences as well as whenever I do a training on doing LEED or code compliance energy simulation.  I?ve done my own sensitivity analysis of many of the free Minneapolis area climate files and found I can vary the EUI of an office building with a VAV system by 14% just by selecting a different climate file that?s 12 miles away.  Even more interesting (at least to me) was that I could change which design decision was best by changing the climate file.  For example, the MSP climate file resulted in glazing X being the lowest EUI while selecting the Eden Prairie file (12 miles away) resulted in glazing Y being the best.  There?s no micro climates involved and both of these files ?bin out? to CZ6.  However, neither of them are particularly ?representative?.  Eden Prairie has -12 F hours in May while the MSP file has 92 F degree hours in April.  A quick check of the historical records show that -12F has never happened in recorded history in May in the Minneapolis area.  Anyone who lives in Minneapolis can tell you that 90+ in April isn?t common.  Even 70+ in April isn?t that common.  A quick check of the historical record shows one time in nearly 200 years of records where above 90 was recorded before April 15.  The third file, Crystal, was documented as having sub-freezing temps in the summer months in my previous reply to this thread.  So that?s not representative, either.  If there were no other options (which there are), I?d go with MSP as the best of a bad hand of climate files.

Appendix G only requires in G2.3 (90.1-2010): ?The simulation program shall perform the simulation using hourly values of climatic data, such as temperature and humidity from representative climatic data, for the site in which the proposed design is to be located.  For cities or urban regions with several climatic data entries, and for locations where weather data are not available, the designer shall select available weather data that best represent the climate at the construction site.  The selected weather data shall be approved by the rating authority.?

The way this is written, I can literally pick any weather file ? even if it is known to be filled with errors ? and use it for LEED compliance and/or code as long as its nearby my proposed building.  It?s up to the rating authority to question it.

I?ve gotten many LEED review and code review comments in doing simulation.  I?ve never once been asked about the quality of the climate data that was used in the simulation.  Yet it impacts everything in the simulation: envelope, equipment performance (as many equipment performance curves are dependent on ambient conditions), and glazing selection just to name a few.

The mentality of ?plug and chug?, or worse, not even bothering to know which climate file your simulation program is actually using when it spits out results, is a very dangerous game if you?re at all concerned about a reliable result ? and by extension ? providing your customers with sound recommendations on how to spend their money.

While nothing is perfect, I?ve had good experiences with using www.weatheranalytics.com<http://www.weatheranalytics.com> as a source for both TMY and AMY files.  If there?s a problem with a file they create, they?ve been really good about making it right quickly.

Another big problem with the free TMY3 files is they aren?t very up to date (2005 was ten years ago).  Which is another reason why I like weatheranalytics.com<http://weatheranalytics.com> ? I can get more up-to-date weather data to help make a more informed decision.

Part 2.

In my opinion, Appendix G needs a new section for compliance: Pre-simulation Climate Analysis (call it Table G3.09).


1.       Perform analysis on at least 1 TMY and 3 AMY (within the last 10 years) climate files near your site.  If three aren?t available, document where you looked and what process was done to select the climate file used in simulation.  (Although with services like Weather Analytics now available, this shouldn?t really be a problem for pretty much any project anywhere).  Submit plots of dry-bulb temperatures and provide a narrative describing the process used in selecting the climate file used in the simulation.  Include metrics like climate zone, bin analysis, and numerical justifications as well as local knowledge from trusted data sets in either the public or private domain.

2.       Document both the ASHRAE defined climate zone from 90.1/169 and perform your own BIN analysis in accordance with ASHRAE methodology for non-defined locations.  Submit both the defined climate zone and the derived climate zone.  If they are different, advise as to which climate zone is being used in the simulation for baseline building generation.

?         Fun facts (using TMY3 data sets): Dallas is defined at CZ 3A, it bins out to 2A.  Nashville is defined as CZ 4A, it bins out to 3A.  Toronto is defined as 6A, it bins out to 4A.  All these are listed in 90.1-2010 which is the referenced standard in LEED v4 as well as an approved compliance path in IECC 2012.  This is another potential design quandary: to get code approval and/or LEED points, I use a defined list in a table.  However, the building is being built and will never actually see the weather that was used to define the climate zone.

Better yet ? get rid of defined climate zones altogether when taking a performance path.  Require professionals who do simulation to understand how to open and analyze a climate file and derive the climate zone.  Require review of that process by the AHJ and agreement that the analysis is valid and the CZ selected makes sense for the project.

After you pointed this out, we started exploring this issue and did find significant differences in current weather files and 30 year average/EPW files.
As IBPSA members, we should take this issue up on a national level to come up with a resolution.

To add to the list of tools that already does this for you:

IES VE does this for you in the Vista application.  Whether you?ve run an annual simulation or not, you can plot multiple variables overlaid on one another:





3D graphs:


?Heat Maps?:



You can also create your own custom variables in the VE (so you could create an enthalpy variable from the other variables and plot it on a graph or export to a spreadsheet, etc.):



This is a .EPW file format from: http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/cfm/weather_data3.cfm/region=4_north_and_central_america_wmo_region_4/country=1_usa/cname=USA
For those of you still tuned in ? a bit of a digression:

Note the values that are errors in June and August (the DB is well below freezing 10 F) ? that?s never happened in the recorded history of the area ? let alone in the timeframe that TMY3 files are comprised of).  The coldest value EVER for the entire state in the month of August is 21 F.  That occurred in Kelliher which is more than 200 miles north of this location.

I?d suggest opening any of the climate files you get and ensuring they aren?t full of invalid data points.  I?ve found far too many of them to be too error-filled to be useful for simulation.  Eden Prairie, MN (still spelled incorrectly on the DOE website ? ?Edin?) is also rife with sub-zero temperatures in May (also never happened in recorded history).  The Portland, OR TMY3 has 114 F days in late October (ditto).  I think you get the idea.

Robert,
Once you get two psychrometric data points of moist air, you should be able to derive the other properties that you desire.  A lot of the hourly weather files just happen to provide humidity in DP.  Obviously if you have more than a few data points to evaluate (like a full TMY3 file), looking them up on a psych chart isn?t very practical.  Unless you?re particularly interested in evaluating partial pressure equations, I would recommend using readily available software as a data filtering tool.  I recommend ClimateConsultant which is a free software produced by UCLA:
http://www.energy-design-tools.aud.ucla.edu/climate-consultant/request-climate-consultant.php

The software can be used for visualizing weather data and evaluating heating and cooling strategies.  It?s great for that, but I often simply use it to filter raw weather files and then export to Excel.  The whole process takes 5 minutes once you have the software installed.  You simply find the appropriate EPW weather file (EnergyPlus format) from the web (link provided in the software) and import it into ClimateConsultant.  You can then export to csv.  I like how the software will automatically convert from SI to IP units.  You can choose other ways of representing humidity like RH and WB.  You can also use it to quickly construct daily or monthly averages if desired.



Anyway, that?s my plug for ClimateConsultant for those of us that can?t program good data filters (or are too lazy).  I hope it?s helpful.

White Box Technologies (WBT), in collaboration with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), has revised the TMY3 weather files to correct inconsistencies in units for illuminances, improve the reporting of Liquid Precipitation, replace all missing records with interpolated or filled values (chiefly for visibility, ceiling height, aerosol optical depth, and albedo), and add a new variable for Present Weather.

Since their release in 2005, the TMY3 weather files covering 1,020 locations in the US and dependencies has become the standard set of weather files for use in computer simulations of solar energy conversion systems and buildings. The intent of this revision is not to redo the fundamental analysis, but correct some known errors and make modest improvements in the reporting of subsidiary climate variables.

The only impact from these corrections and changes are for daylighting simulations that use the illuminance values, and for building simulations that use the liquid precipitation to model green roofs or moisture transport through the building envelope. The added Present Weather variable is not directly used in any simulation program, but allows the DOE-2 BINM files to have correct IRAIN and ISNOW flags, although these two variables are not being used in DOE-2.  Filling in missing data for Visibility, Ceiling Height, etc., should have no impact on the use of the TMY3s, but improves their overall record-keeping.

The revised TMY3 files in their native CSV format have been provided back to NREL and are available here:    http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/1991-2005/tmy3

The revised TMY3 files in EPW and BINM formats are available for free download on the White Box Technologies web site at  http://weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com/wd-TMY3 or by selecting File Type as "TMY3" at http:/weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com/search<http://weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com/search> to search using GoogleEarth. The zip file names are unchanged, but the underlying EPW and DDY files will have the *TYA designation to distinguish them from the previous TMY3 versions.

For a more detailed description and full documentation of the revision,  please see the attached memorandum.

Hi Bill,

I?m referencing .EPW file formats ? so perhaps the error is in there (although I doubt it ? more on that in a bit).  Have you investigated the dry bulb temperatures and other psychrometrics in the files you?re using to ensure they show the same things appear in the .EPW files I?m using (at least for the files that are common between the formats)?  I know there?s a significant difference in the solar models in the VE and eQuest  and since solar data is something that?s used from the climate files, this also likely plays a role (like I said, the climate file affects everything).  Based on the randomness and frequency of the errors, I think the raw TMY3 data was the source of the data problems ? but perhaps it?s a conversion error (or maybe even some combination of the two).  I?ve looked at hundreds of these climate files doing training for projects all over the world and there?s lots of errors in them.  Anyone can plot the dry bulbs from these files and see them for themselves.  And the errors aren?t consistently occurring in the same time or place in the climate files ? they appear to be random.  Plus, it?s not one or two files.  So I assumed the raw data set was the trouble rather than some conversion.  Since we?re using two different file sets in different formats, this may well be why I show a large discrepancy in EUI while your simulations show a smaller discrepancy.  Which reinforces my point about ?plugging and chugging? being a dangerous game.

I had to re-size the graph so it?s hard to read ? but the results show a small flip of which glazing has the lowest EUI between climate files.  My hunch is that if I were to reduce the EUI further for this building the flip would become more pronounced.  Based on the responses to this thread, seems like I?m going to have to do that and make it a research paper.

Other questions I have about the work I?ve done to this point:

Is this flip ?real??  In other words, does using old data from over a decade ago actually help me understand how this building might perform in the future given the climate is rapidly changing?  Is data that is that old even useful for compliance for projects in the future?  If so, how far back is the data valuable to include?  If not, what other options are there that might be better?  Which of these climate files is the right one to use when considering future climate impacts that this building will see that will never be captured in TMY data sets?  Is TMY really that valuable or are we better off using multiple AMY data sets to develop trends for use in simulation?  I?m also recalling conversations about Bayesian calibration from the last couple ASHRAE conferences and wondering if there might be an application of that to creating climate files.

The larger point of the presentation (which is available through ASHRAE) was that using only EUI or weighting EUI as ?most important? to evaluate design decisions is often insufficient.  For example, the results of ASHRAE 55 comfort simulations in this same building along with peak load calculations using ASHRAE Heat Balance Method showed that the lowest EUI glazing was a poor choice for satisfying occupant comfort as well as requiring the owner to purchase larger equipment than if they went with a slightly higher EUI number.

No, I wouldn?t recommend the lowest EUI glass in this particular instance even if the climate files didn?t present such a problem.  I would recommend an option that balanced EUI with occupant comfort and peak loads among other considerations.  ?Best choice? from an EUI perspective would have been a disaster from the perspective of first cost and thermal comfort ? not to mention visual comfort (daylight and glare).  Every project is different ? but it seems that the industry trend lately has been to make decisions on simulation with EUI as the comparison metric and largely not consider other equally important metrics in building simulation.

You also noted that a more energy efficient building seems less sensitive to climate variation.  Perhaps, but there are at least three things that need further exploration before we can safely arrive at that conclusion (two of which you mentioned directly already and the third you alluded to):


1.       Is there a ?tipping point? of an EUI where a super-low EUI building becomes more sensitive than a merely ?average? low-energy building?  Think about a more passive building ? one with natural ventilation or hybrid ventilation.  I?d expect that building to be more sensitive to climate than one that?s focused solely on HVAC systems to provide comfort.

2.       The sample size of comparing one building in Minneapolis to another that is in upstate NY is a sum of two.

3.       Building type.  If your office became a school, lab, or hospital, what happens then?

I?m on the fence about adding more standards.  In theory, they make things similar for valid comparisons.  In practice, they often restrict reasonable people with sound knowledge from doing things that would be good because the standard easily becomes too restrictive.  It?s extremely difficult (if not impossible) to write a standard that allows for adequate flexibility while making things similar enough to be valid comparisons.  To put it another way, a standard is as much of a floor as it is a ceiling.

Kind regards,

Nathan

Hi Nathan,
I couldn?t find an Eden Prairie file at doe2.com in the TMY, TMY2 or TMY3 format. I also don?t see one at the links that Joe Huang forwarded on 1/30.
Using your graph, wouldn?t you make similar recommendations, regardless of the weather file used? Option 2 is better than Option 1. Options 3 and 4 are a close tie for best choice. As long as you are comparing options (proposed to baseline, glazing 1 to glazing 2 etc.) you should see similar comparative performance as long as you don?t switch weather files mid-stream. Granted, energy modeling results due to differences between weather files will be most pronounced for buildings dominated by envelope or ventilation loads, and you show why running different files can be a useful exercise.
Trying to predict the exact EUI of a new design, or replicate the performance of an existing building, are two things that are very challenging with energy modeling programs at this time. A ?perfect? weather file still only represents one year of conditions. I can see how challenging it must be to develop the format for a ?Typical Meteorological Year?.

Best regards,
Bill

Hi Bill,

You missed the Eden Prairie file which is the one that causes the most variation in EUI as it?s the most extreme.  Below is a graph showing 3 different climate files for a 120,000 SF office in Minneapolis with loads of glass (it?s a LEED Gold building FWIW).

[cid:image002.jpg at 01D04610.80AC4920]

Since there?s a lot of glass on this project, you can also see the impact of changing glass type as well.  Similar colors use the same glass and vary the climate file.  The TMY7 file is one that was purchased from Weather Analytics and contains the most reasonable climate data I could find at the time.  I used IES VE for this analysis for a variety of reasons including system type, details of the solar model, and ability to plot data from the climate files to ensure it wasn?t going to be GIGO.

Your note on unmet hours would have a varying impact in providing insight into this depending how the systems are sized in the tool you?re using.  My guess is the baseline would have unmet hours in it but the proposed would not given that most proposed buildings are sized with more extreme values than in the climate files and we input the actual equipment sizes into the proposed building as opposed to the baseline building.

If there is evidence that using the standard and publicly-available weather files for LEED energy modeling or code compliance results in unreasonable energy performance comparisons, or gives unreliable feedback regarding evaluation of energy conservation measures, than by all means lets support research projects that quantify this, and then determine a path forward. (I suspect this has already been done, but I?m not a weather file expert. I?m not familiar with the IWEC2 format that Dru mentions.) Let?s also support the work of ASHRAE TC 4.2 as Dru suggests. Without research that quantifies weather-file-related impacts on modeling results as a major source of inaccuracy, I?m reluctant to support a new Appendix G requirement for modelers to perform detailed weather/climate analysis.

Seeing Nathan?s email, my devil?s advocate instincts kicked in and I did my own energy modeling test using some Minneapolis area weather files on a project I am working on located in New York State near the St. Lawrence River, which is also Zone 6A. Here are the results of an eQUEST simulation of a 48,000 ft2 office building using the NY weather file and three files from the Minneapolis area (downloaded from doe2.com):

This is a sample size of one project, so YMMV. Could I game the system by picking the best weather file? I suppose. Though there is only a 2% difference in energy savings between the extremes of these four weather files. And this is for an exceptional design. Note also that the NY TMY2 file gives baseline results in between the values of the three Minneapolis TMY3 files. Another interesting take-away as that the more energy efficient a building is, the less sensitive it is to weather effects. These numbers seem fairly robust, in an unscientific-eyeballing-no-statistical-analysis way. Again, n=1.

If any particular weather file is error-riddled, shouldn?t that be apparent from the unmet load hours?
It?d be hard to be unaware of which file you are using, or to hide it from a reviewer (at least when using DOE-2/eQUEST) as the weather file name is at the top of every page of the output report.

The game changes when calibrating models to existing utility bills, or for design system sizing. Actual weather data and ASHRAE design temperatures should be considered in these circumstances.

To amplify Dru's recommendation to get involved with ASHRAE -- an additional route would be to develop a weather file quality standard via the ASHRAE consensus process.  This would specify algorithmic tests applied to a file.  Then any simulation-based compliance method could specify "shall use a weather file that conforms to ASHRAE Std XXX."

Many software developers, including me, have developed weather file QC checkers (half-baked at best in my case).  Getting everyone around one table and agreeing on exactly what is "good enough" would be very helpful to the industry.

The standard could be an addendum to Std 169 perhaps (with a suitable extension of Scope) or a new Standard.  TC 4.2 is the cognizant TC for Std. 169.

Hi Kapil,

Several people have emailed me off the list to express a similar sentiment.  I?ll let them remain anonymous unless they choose to chime in.

Two parts to this email: further exploration of the problems in part 1 and some ideas for solutions in part 2.

Part 1.

I?ve presented on this topic at ASHRAE conferences as well as whenever I do a training on doing LEED or code compliance energy simulation.  I?ve done my own sensitivity analysis of many of the free Minneapolis area climate files and found I can vary the EUI of an office building with a VAV system by 14% just by selecting a different climate file that?s 12 miles away.  Even more interesting (at least to me) was that I could change which design decision was best by changing the climate file.  For example, the MSP climate file resulted in glazing X being the lowest EUI while selecting the Eden Prairie file (12 miles away) resulted in glazing Y being the best.  There?s no micro climates involved and both of these files ?bin out? to CZ6.  However, neither of them are particularly ?representative?.  Eden Prairie has -12 F hours in May while the MSP file has 92 F degree hours in April.  A quick check of the historical records show that -12F has never happened in recorded history in May in the Minneapolis area.  Anyone who lives in Minneapolis can tell you that 90+ in April isn?t common.  Even 70+ in April isn?t that common.  A quick check of the historical record shows one time in nearly 200 years of records where above 90 was recorded before April 15.  The third file, Crystal, was documented as having sub-freezing temps in the summer months in my previous reply to this thread.  So that?s not representative, either.  If there were no other options (which there are), I?d go with MSP as the best of a bad hand of climate files.

Appendix G only requires in G2.3 (90.1-2010): ?The simulation program shall perform the simulation using hourly values of climatic data, such as temperature and humidity from representative climatic data, for the site in which the proposed design is to be located.  For cities or urban regions with several climatic data entries, and for locations where weather data are not available, the designer shall select available weather data that best represent the climate at the construction site.  The selected weather data shall be approved by the rating authority.?

The way this is written, I can literally pick any weather file ? even if it is known to be filled with errors ? and use it for LEED compliance and/or code as long as its nearby my proposed building.  It?s up to the rating authority to question it.

I?ve gotten many LEED review and code review comments in doing simulation.  I?ve never once been asked about the quality of the climate data that was used in the simulation.  Yet it impacts everything in the simulation: envelope, equipment performance (as many equipment performance curves are dependent on ambient conditions), and glazing selection just to name a few.

The mentality of ?plug and chug?, or worse, not even bothering to know which climate file your simulation program is actually using when it spits out results, is a very dangerous game if you?re at all concerned about a reliable result ? and by extension ? providing your customers with sound recommendations on how to spend their money.

While nothing is perfect, I?ve had good experiences with using www.weatheranalytics.com<http://www.weatheranalytics.com> as a source for both TMY and AMY files.  If there?s a problem with a file they create, they?ve been really good about making it right quickly.

Another big problem with the free TMY3 files is they aren?t very up to date (2005 was ten years ago).  Which is another reason why I like weatheranalytics.com<http://weatheranalytics.com> ? I can get more up-to-date weather data to help make a more informed decision.

Part 2.

In my opinion, Appendix G needs a new section for compliance: Pre-simulation Climate Analysis (call it Table G3.09).


1.       Perform analysis on at least 1 TMY and 3 AMY (within the last 10 years) climate files near your site.  If three aren?t available, document where you looked and what process was done to select the climate file used in simulation.  (Although with services like Weather Analytics now available, this shouldn?t really be a problem for pretty much any project anywhere).  Submit plots of dry-bulb temperatures and provide a narrative describing the process used in selecting the climate file used in the simulation.  Include metrics like climate zone, bin analysis, and numerical justifications as well as local knowledge from trusted data sets in either the public or private domain.

2.       Document both the ASHRAE defined climate zone from 90.1/169 and perform your own BIN analysis in accordance with ASHRAE methodology for non-defined locations.  Submit both the defined climate zone and the derived climate zone.  If they are different, advise as to which climate zone is being used in the simulation for baseline building generation.

?         Fun facts (using TMY3 data sets): Dallas is defined at CZ 3A, it bins out to 2A.  Nashville is defined as CZ 4A, it bins out to 3A.  Toronto is defined as 6A, it bins out to 4A.  All these are listed in 90.1-2010 which is the referenced standard in LEED v4 as well as an approved compliance path in IECC 2012.  This is another potential design quandary: to get code approval and/or LEED points, I use a defined list in a table.  However, the building is being built and will never actually see the weather that was used to define the climate zone.

Better yet ? get rid of defined climate zones altogether when taking a performance path.  Require professionals who do simulation to understand how to open and analyze a climate file and derive the climate zone.  Require review of that process by the AHJ and agreement that the analysis is valid and the CZ selected makes sense for the project.

Nathan,
After you pointed this out, we started exploring this issue and did find significant differences in current weather files and 30 year average/EPW files.
As IBPSA members, we should take this issue up on a national level to come up with a resolution.

To add to the list of tools that already does this for you:

IES VE does this for you in the Vista application.  Whether you?ve run an annual simulation or not, you can plot multiple variables overlaid on one another:

[cid:image005.jpg at 01D045F4.6B1E77C0]

[cid:image006.jpg at 01D045F4.6B1E77C0]

?Heat Maps?:

[cid:image008.jpg at 01D045F4.6B1E77C0]

You can also create your own custom variables in the VE (so you could create an enthalpy variable from the other variables and plot it on a graph or export to a spreadsheet, etc.):

[cid:image009.png at 01D045F4.6B1E77C0]

This is a .EPW file format from: http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/cfm/weather_data3.cfm/region=4_north_and_central_america_wmo_region_4/country=1_usa/cname=USA
For those of you still tuned in ? a bit of a digression:

Note the values that are errors in June and August (the DB is well below freezing 10 F) ? that?s never happened in the recorded history of the area ? let alone in the timeframe that TMY3 files are comprised of).  The coldest value EVER for the entire state in the month of August is 21 F.  That occurred in Kelliher which is more than 200 miles north of this location.

I?d suggest opening any of the climate files you get and ensuring they aren?t full of invalid data points.  I?ve found far too many of them to be too error-filled to be useful for simulation.  Eden Prairie, MN (still spelled incorrectly on the DOE website ? ?Edin?) is also rife with sub-zero temperatures in May (also never happened in recorded history).  The Portland, OR TMY3 has 114 F days in late October (ditto).  I think you get the idea.

Robert,
Once you get two psychrometric data points of moist air, you should be able to derive the other properties that you desire.  A lot of the hourly weather files just happen to provide humidity in DP.  Obviously if you have more than a few data points to evaluate (like a full TMY3 file), looking them up on a psych chart isn?t very practical.  Unless you?re particularly interested in evaluating partial pressure equations, I would recommend using readily available software as a data filtering tool.  I recommend ClimateConsultant which is a free software produced by UCLA:
http://www.energy-design-tools.aud.ucla.edu/climate-consultant/request-climate-consultant.php

The software can be used for visualizing weather data and evaluating heating and cooling strategies.  It?s great for that, but I often simply use it to filter raw weather files and then export to Excel.  The whole process takes 5 minutes once you have the software installed.  You simply find the appropriate EPW weather file (EnergyPlus format) from the web (link provided in the software) and import it into ClimateConsultant.  You can then export to csv.  I like how the software will automatically convert from SI to IP units.  You can choose other ways of representing humidity like RH and WB.  You can also use it to quickly construct daily or monthly averages if desired.

[cid:image010.png at 01D045F4.6B1E77C0]

Anyway, that?s my plug for ClimateConsultant for those of us that can?t program good data filters (or are too lazy).  I hope it?s helpful.

These weather files are great, thanks for the info, but I am trying to get wet bulb temperature too, and they do not seem to give wet bulb temperatures.

Any ideas on that, perhaps?

White Box Technologies (WBT), in collaboration with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), has revised the TMY3 weather files to correct inconsistencies in units for illuminances, improve the reporting of Liquid Precipitation, replace all missing records with interpolated or filled values (chiefly for visibility, ceiling height, aerosol optical depth, and albedo), and add a new variable for Present Weather.

Since their release in 2005, the TMY3 weather files covering 1,020 locations in the US and dependencies has become the standard set of weather files for use in computer simulations of solar energy conversion systems and buildings. The intent of this revision is not to redo the fundamental analysis, but correct some known errors and make modest improvements in the reporting of subsidiary climate variables.

The only impact from these corrections and changes are for daylighting simulations that use the illuminance values, and for building simulations that use the liquid precipitation to model green roofs or moisture transport through the building envelope. The added Present Weather variable is not directly used in any simulation program, but allows the DOE-2 BINM files to have correct IRAIN and ISNOW flags, although these two variables are not being used in DOE-2.  Filling in missing data for Visibility, Ceiling Height, etc., should have no impact on the use of the TMY3s, but improves their overall record-keeping.

The revised TMY3 files in their native CSV format have been provided back to NREL and are available here:    http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/1991-2005/tmy3

The revised TMY3 files in EPW and BINM formats are available for free download on the White Box Technologies web site at  http://weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com/wd-TMY3 or by selecting File Type as "TMY3" at http:/weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com/search<http://weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com/search> to search using GoogleEarth. The zip file names are unchanged, but the underlying EPW and DDY files will have the *TYA designation to distinguish them from the previous TMY3 versions.

For a more detailed description and full documentation of the revision,  please see the attached memorandum.

Thanks Scott,

This application is running well on my computer right now.  The link in 
the application did not work, but the White Box Technologies web site 
gave me the EPW format in CSV and ClimateConsultant did the conversion 
beautifully.

I owe you a <virtual beer>.

Robert,

Are you sure that you got the TMY3 file from the White Box Technologies web site in CSV 
format?  I think those files have only the EPW and BINM formats, the CSV formats were 
given back to NREL and are available on their Web site 
http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/1991-2005/tmy3/ . Maybe that's why 
ClimateConsultant did the conversion so beautifully ? :-) :-)

	Training
Message-ID: <016a01d04714$2d8010b0$88803210$@naturalintelligence.us>

Southern California DesignBuilder/EnergyPlus Training

The training will be run using version 4 of DesignBuilder and will cover many of the new and enhanced features such as the new geometric modeller with enhanced block geometry editing, the ability to mirror blocks, add individual surfaces, and produce cut-away/section visualizations.

The training is suitable for new and experienced users alike. It is fully modular so that people can attend just one or any number of the days. 

The course is organized so that architects could attend only the first 2-3 days and the last 2 days are specific to engineers. The focus on day 3 is low energy and passive design modelling and it would therefore be valuable for both architects and engineers.

Dates: March 30 - April 3, 2015

Location: Southern California Edison Energy Education Center, 6090 N. Irwindale Avenue, Irwindale, CA 91702

Discounts are available for students/researchers/faculty and multiple company attendees booking 4 or more days. 

Space is limited so we encourage early registration.

Additional course information and registration <http://designbuilderusa.com/training/designbuilder-simulation-training-days> .

Don't miss this opportunity to be trained in the easiest to use, most powerful graphical user interface to EnergyPlus available and includes ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G Baseline HVAC System templates, materials, and construction libraries.

Description:
Manual blind controls are typically not included in energy modelling and often not considered in daylight modelling. This is in part because there is no consensus in the research or practice community about the way users operate manual blinds. However, researchers have recently proposed multiple algorithms for this purpose. Blind control patterns affect the energy consumption (interior lighting loads and space heating and cooling loads) of buildings but a deeper understanding of the range of effects is needed before widespread adoption of manual blind control algorithms in daylighting and energy simulation will occur or consensus about appropriate algorithms reached. Preliminary results show annual lighting end-use variances up to more than 6% and other end-uses up to more than 20% depending on the blind control algorithm. This presentation will briefly discuss and compare the proposed algorithms, and describe the process for inclusion of blind control within the simulation programs EnergyPlus and Radiance.

Learning Objectives:

1.       Understand the effect blind control algorithms can have on simulation results.

2.       Discuss the differences between 3 proposed blind control algorithms.

3.       Learn the process of blind control inclusion in EnergyPlus and Radiance.

4.       Integrate blind control results between EnergyPlus and Radiance.
Bio(s):

From yjhuang at whiteboxtechnologies.com  Thu Feb 19 22:24:18 2015

Subject: [Bldg-sim] WEATHER DATA -
Message-ID: <54E6D312.9080607@whiteboxtechnologies.com>

White Box Technologies makes available year 2014 weather files for over 8,600 locations
around the world (2,200 US, 290 Canadian, 6,110 international). Added to the weather files
previously generated going back to 2001, the WBT Weather web site now contains 14-year
time series of hourly weather for 6,500 locations, and shorter time series for another
3,500 locations.  WBT can also create "typical year" weather files for any of these
locations, although one should check first whether there's already a TMY3 for a US location,
or a IWEC2 file for an international location.

For a complete list of all 2014 files, please see
http://www.whiteboxtechnologies.com/ISH2014_USACan_locations.txt or
http://www.whiteboxtechnologies.com/ISH2014_Intern_locations.txt . To search for a weather
file on the WBT Weather web site, please go to: http://weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com
and use either "Search by Google Earth" or "Search by List".

There have also been two new features added to the WBT Web site over the past year:

1) Of special interest to eQUEST users, a feature has been added allowing users to create
a composite weather file with data from two different years, e.g., Jan. 1 - Apr. 30 of
2013, followed by May 1 - Dec. 31 of 2012. This is handy when calibrating simulations to
monitored data, which rarely begin and end in the same calendar year. (see
http://www.whiteboxtechnologies.com/creating_a_composite_year_wthrfile.pdf for details).

2) Of interest to EnergyPlus users, all WBT weather files now come with Design Day files
(*.DDY), either taken from the 2013 ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals, or
calculated from the historical record of that weather station. This second
method has become increasingly important, as the number of WBT weather stations is now
40% larger than that in the ASHRAE HOF. To avoid confusion, these calculated DDY files
are given the extension *.DDY2.

A final note: if you don't find your location of interest on the WBT web site, that
doesn't mean there's no data , just that the data need further processing or extracted
from other sources. This is particularly true for North America, where there
are at least ten times as many unofficial weather stations as there are official stations.
So, if you can't find the weather data you want, please send us an e-mail.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] WEATHER DATA - 2014  weather data now available for 8,
 600 locations around the world

Reposted with correct subject line.

White Box Technologies makes available year 2014 weather files for over 8,600 locations
around the world (2,200 US, 290 Canadian, 6,110 international). Added to the weather files
previously generated going back to 2001, the WBT Weather web site now contains 14-year
time series of hourly weather for 6,500 locations, and shorter time series for another
3,500 locations. WBT can also create "typical year" weather files for any of these
locations, although one should check first whether there's already a TMY3 for a US
location, or a IWEC2 file for an international location.

For a complete list of all 2014 files, please see
http://www.whiteboxtechnologies.com/ISH2014_USACan_locations.txt or
http://www.whiteboxtechnologies.com/ISH2014_Intern_locations.txt . To search for a weather
file on the WBT Weather web site, please go to: http://weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com
and use either "Search by Google Earth" or "Search by List".

There have also been two new features added to the WBT Web site over the past year:

1) Of special interest to eQUEST users, a feature has been added allowing users to create
a composite weather file with data from two different years, e.g., Jan. 1 - Apr. 30 of
2013, followed by May 1 - Dec. 31 of 2012. This is handy when calibrating simulations to
monitored data, which rarely begin and end in the same calendar year. (see
http://www.whiteboxtechnologies.com/creating_a_composite_year_wthrfile.pdf for details).

2) Of interest to EnergyPlus users, all WBT weather files now come with Design Day files
(*.DDY), either taken from the 2013 ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals, or calculated from
the historical record of that weather station. This second method has become increasingly
important, as the number of WBT weather stations is now 40% larger than that in the ASHRAE
HOF. To avoid confusion, these calculated DDY files are given the extension *.DDY2.

A final note: if you don't find your location of interest on the WBT web site, that
doesn't mean there's no data , just that the data need further processing or extracted
from other sources. This is particularly true for North America, where there are at least
ten times as many unofficial weather stations as there are official stations. So, if you
can't find the weather data you want, please send us an e-mail.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] WEATHER DATA - updated CZ2010 weather files for 86
	California locations
Message-ID: <54EB0D1F.1050208@whiteboxtechnologies.com>

The 86 CZ2010 weather files were developed by White Box Technologies on contract to the 
California Energy Commission in 2011 for use in Title-24 compliance calculations as well 
as other solar applications, and replace the previous set of 16 CZ02 weather files that 
date back to the late 1970's.  The period of record was kept short at 12 years (1998-2009) 
to better reflect the current climate, combining surface observations from NCDC's 
Integrated Surface Hourly Database (ISH) with satellite-derived solar radiation from Clean 
Power Research.  The CZ2010 weather files are available at no cost at 
weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com and come in four formats: *.CSV, *.FIN4, *.EPW, and 
*.BINM.   Recently, the design day files for EnergyPlus have been updated and expanded to 
include both annual (*.DDY) as well as monthly (*.DDM) design days. 
weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com/wd-CZ2010  uses GoogleEarth?to search for CZ2010 file 
locations.  Search  by List is also available at weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com/search .

Hi all,

Hope you are doing well,

I have two specific questions concerning the interpretation of ASHRAE standard 90.1-2010 for LEED v4, mandatory provisions for lighting and I hope you can help me. (my project is a classic LEED CS office building in the center of Paris)

The first one is concerning space control. The standard states that each manual devices should have the a) requirement (see below). So my doubt is concerning the "manual" word. It seems that it should be a control step with the "manual interrupters" to three levels (on/middle/off) instead of the classic two levels interruptors? (on/off)? Because, specifically in my project we have natural light dimming/occupant sensor and BMS so I didn't see the interest of put three levels interrupters if the light will be graded with natural light after the lighting device turn on. I'm obliged then to put three levels interrupters in all my project even that I have dimming/occupancy sensors and BMS?

[cid:image001.png at 01D05018.421EDB20]

The second question is concerning Parking garage lighting control (point 9.4.1.3.b. of Ashrae standard 90.1-2010)

[cid:image003.png at 01D05018.FDDD99A0]

In our project we have 1/3 2/3 rule for parking areas. It means that all time at least 1/3 of total luminaires are always ON (the rest are off) unless an occupant is detected within the area, in that case the rest 2/3 of luminaires turns ON. Which is stated in the point b of previous mandatory provisions is that "each" luminaire power should be reduced. Which is impossible with previous system that is very common in France for security reasons. So I need to change my system conception or I can do something? Or I misunderstood the point?

Thanks in advance for all your answers,

Regards,

Thanks for your answer,

I didn?t saw the definition of ? luminaire ? in the standard before, since it state that it consist of a lamp or lamps together I suppose that at the moment  that the reduction of 30% is achieved and my group of lamps is less than 3 600 ft2 I?m ok ?

Vu !

C'est bon pour le 9.4.1.2. What it says it that you have at least one control device (not 24 hrs operation...) and that you need one control step between 30% and 70% (Off/mid/on). Also, IF you happen to have manual devices, they need to be readily accessible.

In your case, the primary control is daylight/occupancy dimming, and you do have more than one control step between 30% and 70%, so I think you're good.
As far as the parking garage goes, not sure.

This mandatory provision seems to be a little tricky. A new question came to my mind.

For example, in the case of meeting rooms (In my project I have most of my meetings rooms in the basement). This means that I need to have a control device ON/middle/OFF in those space who doesn?t have any window or natural daylight.

But,?. Since we doesn?t have daylighting entering into the space?  the ?medium? position will be never used? it doesn?t have any sense. The meeting rooms spaces will be even Off or ON?.

Thanks in advance for your answers,

Best,
David GARCIA-SANCHEZ

To confirm:  I would describe a luminaire as the combination of lamp(s),
fixture, socket(s), drivers/ballasts.  A lighting system is any combination
of luminaires + controls + power/wiring.



I personally read ?manual? to essentially mean ?user-initiated? control, as
opposed to ?automatic? controls.  9.4.1.2 applies to both automatic and
manual controls.  I think that?s in line with the discussion so far.



To explain by way of examples, assuming a basic conference room, here are
some simple solutions meeting the requirements of 9.4.1.2:

?         Two identical luminaires in the space, each capable of providing
sufficient general illumination.  Two ON/OFF toggle switches at the entry,
each controlling a separate fixture.

?         Any number of fixtures on a continuous dimmer

?         Any number of fixtures on a ?stepped? (fixed levels of
illumination) dimmer with one setting resulting in a power draw between 30
and 70% of full load

?         A conference room without manual controls (I realize I?m
stretching, bear with me), but rather illuminated via some combination of
fully automatic control including continuous daylight sensors, timer
control, and occupancy sensors



Each of these scenarios poses a means by which the user can manually
control or the control system can automatically have the lights consume
something between 30 and 70% of the full lighting load.  Note this energy
standard doesn?t push too hard with respect to quality of light delivery,
but be mindful of the glossary entry for ?lighting, general.?



As to parking, you might be in the clear with the system you?ve described.
Before focusing on the automatic reduction passage below, consider section
9.4.1.3 leads with allowances to exempt automatic controls for security
reasons or intended 24-hr operation (?comply with 9.4.1.1?, *and its
exceptions!*).  That said, beyond the other requirements for
perimeter/ramp/entry controls and safety/security exemptions, my reading is
that the intent is to generally require automatic power reduction of at
least 30% via occupancy sensors.



The chosen wording ?each fixture? implies a combination of luminaires and
controls more sophisticated (yes, expensive) than ON/OFF control, and that
wording is most likely intended to ensure the reduced lighting level is
uniform, and thereby maximally safe and adequate for the purposes of
avoiding liability for those enforcing this standard as code or referencing
it for design.  If the engineer responsible for the lighting design is
comfortable making a written case to the appropriate authorities &
concerned parties (in this instance, inclusive of your LEED reviewers) that
an alternate energy reduction approach is sufficiently safe in the reduced
state and otherwise is in keeping with the requirements for automatic power
reduction, then including such supporting documentation alongside your
other model documentation *ought* to be sufficient.



? But that?s just my opinion.  Another correct answer would be to design to
the applicable energy standard from the start ;).



Another correct answer is nobody may be looking as hard at these minutiae
as we are, and long email discussions won?t change that reality... such is
the curse of being passionate about your job!



I hope that?s helpful!

This mandatory provision seems to be a little tricky. A new question came
to my mind.



For example, in the case of meeting rooms (In my project I have most of my
meetings rooms in the basement). This means that I need to have a control
device ON/middle/OFF in those space who doesn?t have any window or natural
daylight.



But,?. Since we doesn?t have daylighting entering into the space?  the
?medium? position will be never used? it doesn?t have any sense. The
meeting rooms spaces will be even Off or ON?.



Thanks in advance for your answers,



Best,

Thanks for your answer,



I didn?t saw the definition of ? luminaire ? in the standard before, since
it state that it consist of a lamp or *lamps together *I suppose that at
the moment  that the reduction of 30% is achieved and my group of lamps is
less than 3 600 ft2 I?m ok J





Thanks again for your answer!

Vu !

C'est bon pour le 9.4.1.2. What it says it that you have at least one
control device (not 24 hrs operation...) and that you need one control step
between 30% and 70% (Off/mid/on). Also, IF you happen to have manual
devices, they need to be readily accessible.



In your case, the primary control is daylight/occupancy dimming, and you do
have more than one control step between 30% and 70%, so I think you're good.

As far as the parking garage goes, not sure.

Hi all,



Hope you are doing well,



I have two specific questions concerning the interpretation of ASHRAE
standard 90.1-2010 for LEED v4, mandatory provisions for lighting and I
hope you can help me. (my project is a classic LEED CS office building in
the center of Paris)



The first one is concerning space control. The standard states that each
*manual* devices should have the a) requirement (see below). So my doubt is
concerning the ?manual? word. It seems that it should be a control step
with the ?manual interrupters? to three levels (on/middle/off) instead of
the classic two levels interruptors? (on/off)? Because, specifically in my
project we have natural light dimming/occupant sensor and BMS so I didn?t
see the interest of put three levels interrupters if the light will be
graded with natural light after the lighting device turn on. I?m obliged
then to put three levels interrupters in all my project even that I have
dimming/occupancy sensors and BMS?





The second question is concerning Parking garage lighting control (point
9.4.1.3.b. of Ashrae standard 90.1-2010)





In our project we have 1/3 2/3 rule for parking areas. It means that all
time at least 1/3 of total luminaires are always ON (the rest are off)
unless an occupant is detected within the area, in that case the rest 2/3
of luminaires turns ON. Which is stated in the point b of previous
mandatory provisions is that *?each?* luminaire power should be reduced.
Which is impossible with previous system that is very common in France for
security reasons. So I need to change my system conception or I can do
something? Or I misunderstood the point?



Thanks in advance for all your answers,


Regards,

Hi there,

I am working on an energy model for a LEED new building project. There is a crawl space in the  building that will be conditioned from an existing steam distribution system. Do I have to model this space as this is un-occupiable. The proposed design consists of all electrical HVAC system. The baseline is modeled as system 4. And if i do have to model the crawlspace with existing steam, will this impact the baseline HVAC system type? Will the baseline system be all electric?  

Thanks.

Attiq
