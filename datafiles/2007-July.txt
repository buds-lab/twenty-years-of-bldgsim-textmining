I would think that for the base building, its ok to do just one (since
you have to run each orientation and average it, and since you discount
self shading). The designed building will self shade though, so you
might want to build that into the study. Might not be that significant
though (might not be worth the effort of modeling all buildings).

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] appartment complex energy model for LEED



This is an apartment building complex with identical buildings in
different orientations. To do energy analysis for LEED in eQUEST does
one need to model the entire complex (all buildings together)? Or can
one just model one of the typical buildings and run that model in the
various orientations and sum up energy use?

Is there a certain requirement for LEED?

Thanks

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200707301533.AA3324390pd80001463002@gard.com>

Dear all,

I'm facing some challenges with Ecotect, partly because of my limited
familiarity with the tool. Specifically with a US building in mind, I need
your input on the following:

1. Is it possible to get a Btu number for whole building energy consumption
directly out of the software? (as opposed to the exclusive heating and
cooling Btus output in the thermal analysis tab)
2. Is it possible to associate a utility rate, time of use or linear, and
get a total dollar number for annual utility cost - for instance as required
by ASHRAE energy cost budget/Appendix G?
3. Is it possible to get a number for peak electric demand as opposed to
just peak cooling load?

Thanks,

Ramana Koti, LEED AP

Has anyone tried using EnergyPlus in a multi-cpu / shared memory system
environment? Most new CPUs are dual core or quad core. So running a
simulation on these computers will only use, at best 50% of the CPU
resources. So this is a great way to speed up the simulation run-time.
 
I'm spec-ing out the requirements to get ESP-r to take advantage of this
since both the Intel and gcc 4.2 compilers support the OpenMP standard,
and was wondering if EnergyPlus already allows for this.

I ran into this once on  lab project in the northwest (mild climate).  Turned out the higher performance glazing was trapping the high internal heat gains. Higher cooling energy and lower heating energy.

And the cooling energy of Glass type II is a little highter. It make me confused. Why the load due to  due to occupancy /lighting/euqipment  was different when Glass type changed. 
 
And I doubt if the problem has something to do with OA load .

If cooling load is increasing with decreasing SC that would seem to
suggest that your lights are going on for more hours, check your day
lighting settings (if on).  Also, with such high U-factors, the ambient
air ( I am assuming a warm hot climate ) may be also adding to your
cooling load.
 
Try adding some exterior shades and see what happens.

Just a theory, but do you have the daylighting option turned on? If so -
the visible transmittance (I am assuming Glass 2 is darker) will make a
difference. It will increase your lighting load, and in turn your
cooling load.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200707300848.AA4816296pd80001462450@gard.com>

Hello All,

Has anyone modeled a pool in eQuest?  I am modeling a space that contains a
24 X 44 foot pool.  I'm estimating 55 lbs/hr of evaporation per sf of
surface area (for any period of time when the pool is uncoverd).  At a
minimum I need to model space dehumidification and the energy needed to heat
the pool and replacement water.  I checked the help files and am using a
reheat fan system, as suggested.

I can simply input a latent load into the space to simmulate the humidity,
and manually calculate and input an energy load for pool heat, but I'd like
to do better.

Thanks,

What I did is define a new glass type with simplied method in detailed
model. Then replace the old glass with the new defined one. Can this do? How
to avoid the defauls percolate through the program? I check again and find
that there was no wrong with the conduction heat and solar radiation through
window .But the load due to occupancy /lighting/euqipment of Glass Type II
is higher than Glass Type I . And the cooling energy of Glass type II is a
little highter. It make me confused. Why the load due to  due to occupancy
/lighting/euqipment  was different when Glass type changed.

And I doubt if the problem has something to do with OA load .

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200707290052.AA5216984pd80001462081@gard.com>

Dear all

I have tried to compare the energy consumption between two different glass
types and got a curious result. The parameters of these two glasses are
listed below:

1) Coated U=2.5 SC=0.45
2) low-e U=1.76 SC=0.44

I thought the energy consumption of Glass Type II would be lower than that
of Glass Type I . But the result is the cooling energy of Glass Type II is
higher than  that of Glass Type I , and the heating energy lower than that
of Glass Type I.

I have no idea of this. And I checked LS-F/ SS-D / BEPS and found some
points listed below

1) in LS-F annual sensible  cooling load of Glass Type II is lower than that
of Glass Type I , latent cooling load of Glass Type II is higher. The total
annual cooling load of Glass Type II is a little higher

2) in SS-D monthly cooling energy of Glass Type II is  higher

3) dencity and schedule of occupancy /lighting /euqipment are the same in
the two models , but cooling load and heating load due to these indoor
factors are different , why?

4) monthly schedule of occupancy /lighting /euqipment  is all the same
during the year, but cooling load and heating load due to these indoor
factors are different every month, why?

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200707271721.AA2151859pd80001461815@gard.com>

Hello,
 
I'm using BEOpt to model packed earth structures as part of my masters project with walls up to 3' thick.  For walls over 2', I get a DOE 2 error that says the wall is "too thick or too dense" and then the simulation ceases  Is there a way to prevent this from happening?  
 
A compromise I am considering is using a maximum 2' thickness, but increasing the specific heat or density of the material to simulate thicker walls.  Is there a better way?

Thanks,
Jon

Well, the use of the elevators becomes an assumption of energy use.
Recently we had a project where each cubicle had a motion sensor that
controlled the local up-lighting, task lighting, and computer monitors.
A diversity factor was used that accounted for a good bit of this, but
didn't completely include things like bathroom/smoke breaks,
vacation/sick days, or employees attending meetings elsewhere in the
building.  Elevators, like many other factors, are hard to estimate
exact use, and working with a code that acknowledges this for energy use
is currently far more tedious than we'd like to work with.

AAHH, Graham,

I agree, the DESIGN of the building, ie if it has pleasant stairs
(filled with daylight and open, etcc..) and the ORGANIZATION of program
elements are important aspects of a truly sustainable building.  (ps
engineers, talk to your architects on this, get engaged) How to capture
these things in the simulation, however, as you all know can be risky
and if so I would recommend it be well documented to the client you are
doing so.

The only recent building (and subsequent study) on this I know, is on a
new office building for the GSA (our national general services agency)
in LA with more communicating stairs and skipstop elevators.

Subject: Re: [BLDG-SIM] Energy use for elevators

I don't disagree that VT is important.  In fact we find it can  
represent 15% of base building energy use in some buildings.  We also  
find that you can put the exact same generation of lift gear into two  
similar buildings and have lift energy use that is 5 times different  
because it is all dependent on how people move through the building  
and whether the business is internally focussed or externally where  
more people come and go on a daily basis leading to high energy  
use ...  As a result I am sceptical of predictions.

In Australia Green Star, our equivalent of LEED, nominates an energy  
budget for the purposes of energy simulation.  For fairness I would  
have thought Appendix G should nominate a similar budget that should  
only be departed from if there are compelling reasons to do so;  
otherwise, don't you risk creating inequity in ASHRAE 90.1  
comparisons depending on whether the modeller has been optimistic or  
conservative in their lift duty assumptions?

Our head office uses less than half the lift energy use of other  
buildings because we have open communication stairs with a main entry  
at Level 4 so people use the stairs up and down 2-3 floors.  How does  
ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G factor that in?

Well, the use of the elevators becomes an assumption of energy use.
Recently we had a project where each cubicle had a motion sensor that
controlled the local up-lighting, task lighting, and computer monitors.
A diversity factor was used that accounted for a good bit of this, but
didn't completely include things like bathroom/smoke breaks,
vacation/sick days, or employees attending meetings elsewhere in the
building.  Elevators, like many other factors, are hard to estimate
exact use, and working with a code that acknowledges this for energy use
is currently far more tedious than we'd like to work with.

AAHH, Graham,

I agree, the DESIGN of the building, ie if it has pleasant stairs
(filled with daylight and open, etcc..) and the ORGANIZATION of program
elements are important aspects of a truly sustainable building.  (ps
engineers, talk to your architects on this, get engaged) How to capture
these things in the simulation, however, as you all know can be risky
and if so I would recommend it be well documented to the client you are
doing so.

The only recent building (and subsequent study) on this I know, is on a
new office building for the GSA (our national general services agency)
in LA with more communicating stairs and skipstop elevators.

Subject: Re: [BLDG-SIM] Energy use for elevators

I don't disagree that VT is important.  In fact we find it can  
represent 15% of base building energy use in some buildings.  We also  
find that you can put the exact same generation of lift gear into two  
similar buildings and have lift energy use that is 5 times different  
because it is all dependent on how people move through the building  
and whether the business is internally focussed or externally where  
more people come and go on a daily basis leading to high energy  
use ...  As a result I am sceptical of predictions.

In Australia Green Star, our equivalent of LEED, nominates an energy  
budget for the purposes of energy simulation.  For fairness I would  
have thought Appendix G should nominate a similar budget that should  
only be departed from if there are compelling reasons to do so;  
otherwise, don't you risk creating inequity in ASHRAE 90.1  
comparisons depending on whether the modeller has been optimistic or  
conservative in their lift duty assumptions?

Our head office uses less than half the lift energy use of other  
buildings because we have open communication stairs with a main entry  
at Level 4 so people use the stairs up and down 2-3 floors.  How does  
ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G factor that in?

I don't disagree that VT is important.  In fact we find it can  
represent 15% of base building energy use in some buildings.  We also  
find that you can put the exact same generation of lift gear into two  
similar buildings and have lift energy use that is 5 times different  
because it is all dependent on how people move through the building  
and whether the business is internally focussed or externally where  
more people come and go on a daily basis leading to high energy  
use ...  As a result I am sceptical of predictions.

In Australia Green Star, our equivalent of LEED, nominates an energy  
budget for the purposes of energy simulation.  For fairness I would  
have thought Appendix G should nominate a similar budget that should  
only be departed from if there are compelling reasons to do so;  
otherwise, don't you risk creating inequity in ASHRAE 90.1  
comparisons depending on whether the modeller has been optimistic or  
conservative in their lift duty assumptions?

Our head office uses less than half the lift energy use of other  
buildings because we have open communication stairs with a main entry  
at Level 4 so people use the stairs up and down 2-3 floors.  How does  
ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G factor that in?

although, for a truly sustainable building, not all elevators are
created equal, and one should look for those manufacturers that are

Question:


What is the relative energy efficiency of various elevator drive
mechanisms? For example, some elevators use "regenerative" motors (when
the carriage goes down, the motor acts as a generator and pumps current
back into the electrical network, producing energy savings). 


Answer:


The following describes various types of elevators.  

Low-rise buildings may use an elevator driven and supported by a
telescoping jack powered by a hydraulic motor. These units operate at a
low, fixed-speed, do not feature regenerative braking, and have a
limited travel or lift of approximately 25-feet. 

For a building with seven or fewer floors, a variation of the hydraulic
elevator may be specified that features a constant speed hydraulic pump
which imparts pressurized hydraulic fluid onto a hydraulic elevator
drive motor. Varying the control valve setting provides the ability to
vary the elevator speed. These hydraulic elevators are equipped with
counterbalances, but do not have regenerative braking. These units are
often found in mid-rise facilities with "residential" usage
characteristics, such as apartments, condominiums, or nursing homes.

High-rise buildings are served by geared or gearless traction elevators.
These elevators are driven by DC MG sets, silicon controlled rectified
(SCR) DC motors, or variable voltage variable frequency (VVVF) drives
coupled to AC motors. All of these configurations provide variable and
high-speed operation and provide regeneration, but exhibit different
operating efficiencies. 

Dover Elevators has calculated the average kWh required per day for a
single elevator equipped with MG, SCR, and VVVF drives (see table
below). Elevators with hydraulic drives would be expected to use about
25% more energy than the SCR drive. The average energy use values are
given for elevators of various capacities, serving from 3 to 32 floors,
and are based upon an 8-hour operating day and an elevator with a
maximum full-load mass of 19,000 pounds. 

Average Energy Consumption (kWh) Per Day

	
Number of 

Floors

	2500 # Capacity

	4000# Capacity

	
VVVF

	SCR 

	MG

	VVVF

	SCR

	MG

	92

	151

	
30

	58

	67

	102

	92

	108

	164

	

Note: Average energy consumption values are based on 8 hours of elevator
operation per day. If energy consumption for 10-hour operation is
desired, multiply the numbers in the table by 1.25 

In general, traction elevators, or elevators with regeneration
capability, initially cost twice as much as hydraulic units, and are
typically found in office buildings with heights of 5 stories or
greater.

It does because it makes the percentage energy saved smaller.

Does it really matter that this end use is included if the Base Case
vertical transportation energy use is the same as the Design Case?

		Eric,

		Thanks a lot for your reply.

		I have a further question. If we have the elevator power
data, what appropriate schedule should we use to approximately to get
the elevator annual energy use?

		I checked the ASHREAE Appendix G but cannot find
appropriate schedule for elevators.

	I think the schedule of elevators are quite diffent from other
schedules like occupancy scheule. One example, supposing people work
from 8am to 6pm continuously, I guess that elevator working schedule
should not be the same. Do you have any ideas what appropriate schedule
should we use?

		Thanks a lot.

		Dear All,
		
		I have seen some messages these days asking the energy
use of elevators. But it seems that there is no very accurate way of
modeling annual lift energy use.
		
		If we need to simulate building energy use according to
ASHRAE 90.1-2004 for LEED accrediation in e-QUEST, do we need to
simulate elevator energy use or not? Is it a must do? Could somebody
with experience with this topic give me some hints?
		
		Thanks a lot in advance.

It does because it makes the percentage energy saved smaller.

Does it really matter that this end use is included if the Base Case
vertical transportation energy use is the same as the Design Case?

	Eric,

	

	Thanks a lot for your reply.

	

	I have a further question. If we have the elevator power data,
what appropriate schedule should we use to approximately to get the
elevator annual energy use?

	

	I checked the ASHREAE Appendix G but cannot find appropriate
schedule for elevators.

	I think the schedule of elevators are quite diffent from other
schedules like occupancy scheule. One example, supposing people work
from 8am to 6pm continuously, I guess that elevator working schedule
should not be the same. Do you have any ideas what appropriate schedule
should we use?

	

	Thanks a lot.

	

	Regards,

		Dear All,
		
		I have seen some messages these days asking the energy
use of elevators. But it seems that there is no very accurate way of
modeling annual lift energy use.
		
		If we need to simulate building energy use according to
ASHRAE 90.1-2004 for LEED accrediation in e-QUEST, do we need to
simulate elevator energy use or not? Is it a must do? Could somebody
with experience with this topic give me some hints?

Try playing with night purge.  I suspect the lower U-Value is  
penalising you by trapping heat at night that is then retained for  
the morning to become an AC load.  If you look at peak loads and have  
simulated using a design day you should see an improvement in peak  
loads by lowering the U-Value.  A thermally massive building would  
make the % change between glasses appear even less.

Hi Anna,

Pitched roofs can be a pain.  If your geometry is complicated, the program
will not be able to calculate the pitched roof geometry.  Simple rectangles,
L-shapes and T-shapes work the best for pitched roofs.  You may be able to
simplify the geometry a little bit and have the program calculate the
pitched roof.

The other way to handle it is to break the building into a couple of shells
and then do the pitched roof.  The program will always locate the main
peak along the longer dimension of a rectangle.  Sometimes you can also
approximate using flat roofs, depending on what info you are after.

If it's a really complicated roof, I usually get as close as I can using the
wizard, and then make edits in detailed edit mode.

One thing I haven't been able to figure out is how to get the wizard to do
knee walls or cathedral ceilings--anyone know?

Hope this helps.

Looking at the 1997 & 2005 ASHRAE Fundamentals chapter on Thermal Comfort (Ch. 8), it appears that the data is based on various studies that have been done ranging from the years 1955 through 1994 (the bibliography is over two pages long for this chapter alone). Table 4, Typical Metabolic Heat Generation for Various Activities lists "Sources: Compiled from various sources. For additional information, see Buskirk (1960), Passmore and Durnin (1967), and Webb (1964)." The bibliography lists those source documents as:

Dear all,

I am a PhD Student working on the interdependencies of thermal comfort, user behaviour and architecture.
For my simulations I am looking for measured data for heat loads of persons.
International literature (like ashrae fundamentals) agrees, that in offices in a seated position one average person has about 70W, and I don't know if this value is theoretical or already based on measurements. Does anybody know about any measurements to support or disprove this value?

Thank you in advance and kind regards,

BLDG-SIM,

Recently, Kathy Bash of DMS Architects gave a presentation 
to BSUG titled "Architecture As a Second Language -- 
collaboration between architects and engineers" that I 
thought many of you would find interesting. I have posted a 
copy of the presentation at:

http://www.gard.com/ml/ASL.pdf

Below is Tom White's original posting about it. 

Please take a look at it and let me know what you think.

Thanks,

Jason

Greetings BSUGgers:

We have just posted the handout for Kathy Bash's BSUG 
presentation: "Architecture As a Second Language -- 
Effective collaboration between architects and engineers"  

To retrieve a copy, point your Internet browser to:

http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/BSUG/files/

and download the file under the 070718 - BSUG July 2007
folder.

You might find Kathy's presentation especially interesting.
A few highlights include:

- A graph of six variables showing Napoleon's march to 
Moscow and how the Grand Arm?e  of 500,000 soldiers was 
decimated piecemeal by the Russians and the winter before 
their return.  

- When a pie chart makes sense and a table can be 
invaluable.  

- A new take on the definitions of the standard 
construction phases of programming, SD, DD, and CD 
(reminiscent of Mike Hatten's integrated design language).  

- An overview of simplified design tools, like Google's 
SketchUp, and when they make sense to use.  

- There are three languages in a project: architect-speak, 
engineering-speak, and owner-speak. Owner-speak is the 
language of decision-making.  

- What if designing buildings were top-down instead of 
bottom up? Code is bottom-up: setting minimum threshold 
criteria. But top-down would be to set a standard or target 
for a sustainable design, then see whether you could meet 
or exceed the target.  

How are all these points related? You'll just have to get 
Kathy's presentation to find out.

Neither 2.1E nor 2.2 reports OA loads separately. What I have done in the past is to make two runs: one with OA, the other with no OA by setting OA to zero or a very small number (be careful about the economizer), then compare the results to get OA loads and other impacts.

EnergyPlus does have an OA report.

Subject: RE:  eQuest Outside Air Load Report


Brandon,
 
I agree that there needs to be better reporting of OA loads in equest.  OA
loads only show up in the system reports so you would have to subtract the
building loads from the load reports to get an approximation of the hourly
OA loads.  Notice I said approximation.  The system reports also include
pipe and duct losses, pump & fan heat and any other system level effects on
your heating/cooling.  The best way I have found to check outside air is to
use the hourly reports.  Remember you can set the hourly report output to a
format that can be easily opened in Excel if you need to do any additional
calculations.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] eQuest Outside Air Load Report


Thanks to all for answers to previous question,
 
Here's one more... I think it has been asked before although I
Google-scanned the archives could not seem to find it.  Namely, where is the
eQuest outside air load reported?  I see lots disclaimers for "The above
loads do not include outside air ventilation loads", but no outside air load
ventilation summary.
 
Do I really have to take a differential between the total load and all other
loads to back-into an outside air load for each space and system? There's
needs to be a better way...!
 
Thanks in advance,

Subject: Question About Equest - Space Peak Load Calculations

I have a question about how Equest calculates the space peak load =

Subject: RE:  Question About Equest - Space Peak Load Calculations

Before equest will use the Design Day information in the schedules you need
to setup actual design days for the simulation to use.

You need to do this in the detailed edit under the Project & Site tab.  You
need to create both a heating and cooling design day and then input the
desired temperature extremes and duration that you wish to simulate.
Reference the climate design data in the ASHRAE Fundamentals Handbook for
your location.  Once you create the design days equest will use them for
equipment sizing rather than the peak heating & cooling loads calculated
from the TMY weather data.

I'll also add that when you simulate a building using a California
climate zone, it automatically creates a Design Day report along with
the standard reports.  This is a nice feature that seems to only be
incorporated with the CZ climate zones.

Subject: Re:  Gas Fireplace

The tricky thing is the schedule of fireplace use.  Then you need to 
determine how much heat is transferred into the space versus how much 
goes up the chimney.  Then define a process load and schedule.  Set 
the sensible gain appropriately.  In the zone you need to define an 
exhaust fan, fan power and schedule to match the source use schedule.

It is from Table G-1 of the "User's Manual of ASHRAE 90.1 2004".   The
schedule has a different percentage for each business hour. I believe
there have been several discussions on this topic, and you can search in
this mailing list.  Drury Crawley previously recommended a white paper
from ACEEE about the actual energy consumptions of elevator usage.
http://www.aceee.org/buildings/coml_equp/elevators.pdf   If you use
Energyplus, the schedule is already combined in its standard schedule
library. 

Hope this helps.

Eric

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200707250506.AA0646531pd80001459876@gard.com>

Dear all,

I am a PhD Student working on the interdependencies of thermal comfort, user
behaviour and architecture.
For my simulations I am looking for measured data for heat loads of persons.
International literature (like ashrae fundamentals) agrees, that in offices in a
seated position one average person has about 70W, and I don't know if this value
is theoretical or already based on measurements. Does anybody know about any
measurements to support or disprove this value?

Thank you in advance and kind regards,

Astrid

I have not made a comparison, but they might be a bit different from the schedules provided in the User Manual. 

Furthermore, you can assign the elevator power data (in kW) directly to the Electric Meter using the 'Interior Direct Loads' tab and then selecting the elevator schedule from the drop down menu. This enduse can be assigned to Misc Equipment and will show up in addition to the plug loads in the BEPU and BEPS report.

    Dear All,

    I have seen some messages these days asking the energy use of elevators. But it seems that there is no very accurate way of modeling annual lift energy use.

    If we need to simulate building energy use according to ASHRAE 90.1-2004 for LEED accrediation in e-QUEST, do we need to simulate elevator energy use or not? Is it a must do? Could somebody with experience with this topic give me some hints?

    Thanks a lot in advance.

Eric,
   
  Thanks a lot for your reply.
   
  I have a further question. If we have the elevator power data, what appropriate schedule should we use to approximately to get the elevator annual energy use?
   
  I checked the ASHREAE Appendix G but cannot find appropriate schedule for elevators.
  I think the schedule of elevators are quite diffent from other schedules like occupancy scheule. One example, supposing people work from 8am to 6pm continuously, I guess that elevator working schedule should not be the same. Do you have any ideas what appropriate schedule should we use?
   
  Thanks a lot.
   
  Regards,

The tricky thing is the schedule of fireplace use.  Then you need to 
determine how much heat is transferred into the space versus how much 
goes up the chimney.  Then define a process load and schedule.  Set 
the sensible gain appropriately.  In the zone you need to define an 
exhaust fan, fan power and schedule to match the source use schedule.

I'll also add that when you simulate a building using a California
climate zone, it automatically creates a Design Day report along with
the standard reports.  This is a nice feature that seems to only be
incorporated with the CZ climate zones.

Before equest will use the Design Day information in the schedules you

You need to do this in the detailed edit under the Project & Site tab.
You
need to create both a heating and cooling design day and then input the

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Question About Equest - Space Peak Load Calculations

I have a question about how Equest calculates the space peak load
calculation.

For all of my internal heat gains (people, lights, equipment) I have
schedules.  When you create a schedule, it not only asks for utilization
for
Sunday through Saturday, but it also asks for a schedule for Design
Cooling
and schedule for Design Heating.  I assume that the Design Cooling
Schedule/Design Heating Schedule is used by Equest to calculate the peak
cooling and heating load for the space.

For instance, lets say I have a laboratory with 8 watts/square foot of
equipment load.  From an energy standpoint, this equipment load really
never
gets higher than 50% throughout the year.  So I create my Sunday through
Saturday schedules with a peak utilization of 0.5000.  However, there
will
be sometimes where 8 watts/square foot will be generated in the
laboratory,
and I need to size my zone supply airflow for this 8 watts/square foot.
Therefore, I create my design cooling schedule to require a peak
utilization
of 1.000.  However, when I run the simulation and go to the "LS-B Space
Peak
Load Component" report the peak cooling load is using the 50%
diversified
load.  Why is this happening?  Shouldn't Equest be using the Design
Cooling
schedule which has a peak utilization of 1.000 all the time?

Brandon,
 
I agree that there needs to be better reporting of OA loads in equest.  OA
loads only show up in the system reports so you would have to subtract the
building loads from the load reports to get an approximation of the hourly
OA loads.  Notice I said approximation.  The system reports also include
pipe and duct losses, pump & fan heat and any other system level effects on
your heating/cooling.  The best way I have found to check outside air is to
use the hourly reports.  Remember you can set the hourly report output to a
format that can be easily opened in Excel if you need to do any additional
calculations.

eQuest outside air load reported?  I see lots disclaimers for "The above

Do I really have to take a differential between the total load and all other

Yes, ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G requires modeling elevator energy as long as it is designed in the project.  You can come up a realistic schedule or stick to a standard schedule in Appendix G if necessary.

Brandon,
 
The first thing that I would do is open up the SIM file and look at the
LS-C report (Building Peak Load Components). This report tells you what
the total building envelope loads and internal heat gains are for peak
cooling and heating conditions. Here are the categories provided:
 
WALL CONDUCTION

ROOF CONDUCTION

WINDOW GLASS+FRM COND

WINDOW GLASS SOLAR

DOOR CONDUCTION

INTERNAL SURFACE COND

UNDERGROUND SURF COND

INFILTRATION 

Since your building appears very insensitive to changes in glazing
U-value my guess is that this report will show that "WINDOW GLASS+FRM
COND" is small compared to the other loads or that one of these other
loads is much larger than the rest. This result may be correct,
especially if the gazing fraction of the facade is low. However, if
"UNDERGROUND SURF COND" is the largest conduction load then you may need
to set U-EFFECTIVE for the slab floors (reasonable values are between
0.01 and 0.02). 
 
You may also find that the building is much more sensitive to changes in
window solar heat gain coefficient than changes in U-value.

All,
 
I have a 3-story historic building, with circa-1920's windows on all
four exposures.  Big, beautiful, clear-glass single-pane architectural
masterpieces.  So while doing an optimization study, it became apparent
to me that substantially changing the U-value and infiltration
coefficients was having very little effect at all on the loads.
 
For example, varying the U-value from 1.27 to 0.55, 0.45 and at last
0.30 in the parametric runs using the 'simplified method' produced a
0.5% total (over all runs) change in the total energy consumption.
Selecting representative glass types using the 'library method' produced
essentially equivalent.  Superimposing upon either of these a change in
the infiltration coefficient from 1/4" to 1/8" to 1/16" to 1/32"
produced no additional effect at all (the INF-METHOD = CRACK keyword is
specified) on the annual energy consumption.
 
Lastly, I changed the baseline glass to "unglazed opening", again with a
mystifying zero net effect on the overall energy consumption.  It's as
if the glass is not being calculated at all, but I see no errors or
warnings in the SIM file.
 
Anyone have an idea on how to debug this?
 
Thanks in advance...

Brandon,
Mysterious. 
 
What's you overall building use (BTU/sf)? Is the glazing are
significant? Where is this building located? (I have done a similar
study in Hawaii where I found that single glazing performs better than
double, because the weather was good for it. 
A good quick gut check  is to look at the LS-F reports and see what
percentage of the loads are coming from window conductance.

Dana
 
I haven't simulated any hospitals under Appendix G, but I have done a
number of pharmaceutical and bio-research labs, which had similar specs
and requirements. 
 
My assumption is that the project intends to seek LEED certification
under LEED-NC 2.2 since you are doing an Appendix G baseline.
 
I also assume that the CUP currently exists and its capacity will not be
expanded to meet the demands of the addition, therefore you will treat
the chilled and hot water from the CUP as purchased cooling and heating
in the proposed design consistent with G3.1.1.1 (this section only
mentions purchased heat, but I think it is reasonable to apply the same
approach to campus chilled water).
 
I would classify the building type as Nonresidential and 3 Floors or
Less & < 75,000 sf, which would require System 3 to be used. Even if you
consider the addition to be part of the larger building, this approach
is still consistent with Section G3.1.1 Exception (a).  
 
I'm not sure why you don't consider this to be a fair comparison since
clearly there is a design decision to be made about connecting the
addition to the existing CUP versus independent cooling and heating
systems.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] ASHRAE 90.1-2004 App. G, Hospital Baseline


Hello all,
 
I am currently working on the ASHRAE 90.1-2004, Appendix G baseline
model of a hospital in Oregon. The part of the building being analyzed
is a 40,000 sf, 3 story addition to an already existing building of
approximately 90,000 sf. I am having some issues determining what to use
for the baseline HVAC system. Here are some key details of the current
as-designed building:

*	Reheat fan system 
*	Constant volume, 60,000 cfm 
*	100% outside air 
*	Draws heat from two boilers and two chiller in a central utility
plant that also serves the rest of the building

These design parameters lead to some confusion when selecting the HVAC
baseline systems. For example:

*	Since the addition is served by a system that serves the entire
building, should building be modeled as an ~130,000 sf building? This
would make it System 5 under Table G3.1.1A. Problems with this are that
it calls it out to be a PVAV w/ reheat, which is not a legitimate
comparison. If the baseline is supposed to be PVAV, the OSA requirements
need to be the same anyways (G3.1.2.5), therefore effectively making it
a constant volume system. 
*	Should the sf be taken relative to only the addition (40,000
sf)? This is also not a fair comparison between the two systems because
the addition draws heating and cooling from a system designed for a much
larger square footage. 

I guess my main questions are if anyone has dealt with large, constant
volume, 100% OSA systems and their baseline HVAC systems and if anyone
has modeled additions that are served by a larger CUP.
 
Thanks for any help in advance.

Thanks for all the replies this morning.  I can now read errors (turns out
they are in the simulation output file readable by D2SimViewer--who would've
guessed?).

The error I currently have is: "LOOP: WELL has no attached primary heating

Loop Well is a loop type lake/well.  Attached is a chiller of type: loop to
loop heat pump.

Any thoughts?  Thanks for everyone's help.

Robert---

What kind of HVAC system are you specifying?  Clearly whatever it is,
the program is having trouble finding an input for this parameter.  You
can probably fix the error by inputting the value in the 'detailed edit'
mode, if you are familiar yet with that term.  

Save trying to go to a class, I would recommend going through a few of
the eQUEST tutorials that are on the internet as a starting point to
learn some of the basics.  Here are some links...

Basic eQUEST tutorial that covers the basics:

http://www.doe2.com/download/equest/eQUESTv3-40_Tutorial.exe

Here's a pdf of a training workbook that Energy Design Resources put out
in Sept. 2004.  Just a heads up, it's a large file (602 pages) but
there's some good info.

Here is a zip file of the examples referenced in the training workbook:

This is my first post.  I hope it gets through to the list.

I just installed eQUEST and I am trying to evaluate a simple two zone / 
two system single floor (with basement) 1500 sq. ft. building.  I keep 
getting errors asking for input as follows: "Hot Deck Supply Flow 
(HSUPPLY-FLOW) (no default)".  When I go to the input screen, everything

is filled in, and the error will not clear.

If I bypass this error, the results are bad.  It will give a screen with

"---PRELIMINARY DESIGN DOES NOT MEET TITLE 24--- ... Hours outside 
throttling range >10 Percent".  The Title 24 printout has "0" for the 
heating standard design, and basically everything is out of compliance.

I would be happy to buy a book, call an expert, or go to a class on 
eQUEST, but none of that seems to be quickly available.  This list is 
the only resource given, so I am giving it a try.

Any ideas?   Anybody?

Karen---

 

I'm assuming you're talking about the '.sim' file that is created by
eQUEST for each model.  It contains the model inputs in a text file that
can be opened with any text editor (Notepad, Crimson Editor, etc.).  The
.sim file can be found in the project directory, with the same name that
you used to save your model.  Good luck.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] loop to loop heat pump

 

Hi all,

I wrote about a week ago how to model a radiant floor system heated by a
heat-pump & ground loop.

I received some answers--thanks! and have set up a test model with a
loop-to-loop heat pump type chiller, lake/well loop and induction coils.
However, when I run the program, it crashes.  I get an error message
stating that details are in a .sin file, but I can't find software to
open or read the file, so I have no idea why the file won't run. 

Any assistance on how to read the .sin file, or changing the file so
that it will run would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Sean, we have found 2 options - one being EnergyPro from Gabel Dodd in
CA - it is CA Title 24 energy code compliance software but can be
manipulated for other regions with some work in DOE2. The other ooption
is Trace 700 (though how they model it is unknown to me - they could not
give me a satisfactory answer when queried.)
 
as an aside, we are currently getting push back from some code officials
regarding refrigerant volume calculations with this system and if they
cannot be resolved by the manufacturer then I would suggest a long hard
look at the viability of this system for certain applications.
 
Peter

Kevin,

Centrifugal chillers have fewer rubbing parts and usually have a
higher airflow than reciprocating chillers.  As a result, they usually
operate at a higher COP than reciprocating chillers do.  For example,
the minimum ASHRAE (90.1-2004) COP for a reciprocating chiller is 4.2
while for a centrifugal chiller it is in the 5.0 - 6.1 range
(depending on the size of your chiller).  You should try running your
model using the higher COP and see if that helps.

Hi Jimmy:

You can use the Equipment Controls and Load Management buttons in the
lower right hand corner of the Controls Tab under Hot Water Loop under
Water Side Tab in eQuest (Detailed Edit Mode). 

You need to put in a annual schedule (as well as week and day schedule)
for the boiler sequence you want, by season. You might for example, say
(for a annual schedule BOILER-SCHED) January thru April is Boiler-Seq-1
Week-Sch), May thru Sept is Boiler-Seq-2 (Week-Sch), and Boiler Seq-1
(Week-Sch)for October thru December. Make Boiler-Seq-1 the same Day-Sch
every day (Mon-Sun+Hol) and the same for Boiler-Seq-2. The Day-Sch for
Boiler-Seq-1 will have a Flag of 1 every hour of the day (if boiler is
to be available every hour), and Boiler-Seq-2 and Flag of 2 for every
hour of the Day-Sch.

The flag is input in the day schedule. The Day-Sch with Flag = 2 will
have ONLY your summer boiler scheduled. The day-Sch with Flag = 1 will
have only your winter boiler scheduled.  The equipment annual schedule
will be input in the Qualification Schedule entry on the General Tab of
the Load management inputs.

Hope this isn't too confusing. All BLDG-SIM members, make sure I said
this correctly.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200707181651.AA5148703pd80001456280@gard.com>

Karen,
I just modeled a similar system in eQuest.  The central loop to loop heat
pump worked out pretty well for me.  You have to set up the model (with all
the necessary loops and pumps) in the detailed mode in eQuest.  I ran into a
few quirks....I've been meaning to send them on to Jeff, but I'll just post
them here instead.  They are only interface issues.


   - When creating a second HP type chiller by copying my first one, it
   asks me to create a new pump.  After I create that pump it never lets
   me out of the 'Required Chiller Data' dialogue box.  I ended up having
   to close eQuest with the task manager and couldn't save my file.


   - When creating a HP chiller from scratch, eQuest asks for a CHW loop,
   HW loop, and CW loop.  The CW loop must be a lake/well loop but that
   isn't one of the options you're given to create.  It's possible to get
   through this issue without things crashing, but it involved randomly
   clicking on cancel a half-dozen times.


   - When I try to change the pump 'motor class' and 'capacity control'
   in the spreadsheet tab, I get errors.

The other thing that it sounds like you'll run into is that you can't put a
boiler on the same loop as your heat pump.  I had to create a separate HW
loop to model back-up energy use from a boiler for the building I was
modeling.  I modeled the radiant system as induction units with fan power
set to zero.

Good luck,
Aleka


Hi All,

I have a question regarding eQuest:

I'm modeling a house that will use a ground source heat pump with boiler
backup as a heat source.  The heat pumps will heat water that is circulated
through radiant tubing in the floor.  Is a loop-to-loop heat pump a good way
to model this?  I've done some research on it, but am not sure whether this
can be modeled in eQuest either in the wizards or parametric runs without
changing the BDL file directly.

How are my options for modeling cooling systems limited with the heating
system described above?

Any help is appreciated.

Thank You,

~Karen~

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] What does ADJUST-LOADS adjust?
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200707181306.AA0618703pd80001456077@gard.com>

All;

I should have known this already, but Jeff Hirsch clarified that DOE-2
users may need to adjust (carefully) the relative
COOLING/HEATING-DESIGN-Ts in buffer zones if auto-sizing airflows. I
USUALLY find the default minimum design airflows and safety factors
result in adequate airflows in the conditioned zones. However:

 

--- 
Jeff Hirsch responded:

Relative to the dT used for the interior wall heat transfer ... 

  

The hourly simulated heat transfer across an interior wall is based on
the hourly 

simulated temperatures on either side of the wall.  The design
calculation heat transfer 

across an interior wall is governed ONLY be the design temperatures of
the zones on 

either side of the wall. 

  

The "adjust loads" feature controls if the peak load arising from the
hourly fixed temperature

load calculation for each SPACE is "adjusted" during the HVAC sizing
calculation based

upon the specified heat/cool design temperatures for the ZONE that
represents that SPACE

for the HVAC simulation. 

  

The unconditioned and plenum design temperatures can start as a "guess"
and then be 

adjusted based upon simulation values.  There is no automated "capture"
of design day 

unconditioned/plenum zone temperatures at the time of each connected
conditioned 

zone peak load to feed into the calculation.  This is not unique to
DOE-2/eQUEST, but 

we are adding a better method to handle this and other sizing issues
automatically in 

the next version of DOE-2 (expected next year) 

  

From JJH's response above, if the design temperatures are the same for a
"plenum" and the space below, there will be no heat transfer during the
sizing calculation; that's why changing "plenum" roof characteristics
did not change design airflow in the conditioned space below the
ceiling.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] What does ADJUST-LOADS adjust?

 

All;
When simulating (eQ v3-61, DOE-2.2 v44e4) a building with a "plenum"
(unconditioned or plenum), and changing the roof absorptance greatly,
the auto-sized design air flow does NOT seem to change in the zone
below, even though the ZONE SIZING-OPTION = ADJUST-LOADS. After
observing this in a big model, I tested this in a simple single zone
model (eQ Wiz). I made sure airflow sizing was driven by cooling loads,
and created a parametric run that changed the ABSORPTANCE of the roof
construction between 90% and 10%. Hourly cooling loads vary as expected,
but design airflow remains the same between both models. 

Raising the DESIGN-COOL-T (from the default 75F, same for all zones) in
the "plenum" increases the design airflow in the zone below (for both
absorptances), but I thought ADJUST-LOADS did more than just recognize
this input. The problem seems to persist whether I have a cooling design
day or not, and whatever I do with the LOADS SPACE "TEMPERATUREs" and
ZONE DESIGN-COOL-Ts. 

Any insights out there? Anyone else notice this behavior? Is this a bug,
or did I expect too much of the program? Unless the DESIGN-COOL-T is
raised (to a value one must estimate or find by inspection of hourly
reports), it appears the program under-sizes airflow to zones where a
significant fraction of the heat gain is through a ceiling
cavity/plenum/attic, or I suppose any "un-conditioned" buffer space.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200707181015.AA1503234pd80001455958@gard.com>

Hi All,

I have a question regarding eQuest:

I'm modeling a house that will use a ground source heat pump with boiler
backup as a heat source.  The heat pumps will heat water that is circulated
through radiant tubing in the floor.  Is a loop-to-loop heat pump a good way
to model this?  I've done some research on it, but am not sure whether this
can be modeled in eQuest either in the wizards or parametric runs without
changing the BDL file directly.

How are my options for modeling cooling systems limited with the heating
system described above?

Any help is appreciated.

Thank You,

~Karen~

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] eQUEST warning messages: HSUPPLY, DHW Loop Pump, CURINV
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200707171125.AA2549203pd80001455497@gard.com>

I am modeling a building in eQUEST with the following HVAC system types:
PTAC, UVT, MZS, PMZS.  The building is situated in New York City, where code
ventilation requirements for the baseline model require exhaust rates
roughly triple ASHRAE 62 guidelines (those requirements will be changing
shortly).  It is a 15 story multifamily building comprised of 5 shells due
to different floor shapes and zoning patterns.  I am having difficulty
understanding three of the warning messages and thought I would see if other
have experienced/solved these problems before.  Thanks in advance!

1)  I am pretty sure this warning message pertains to the MZS or PMZS
because they are the only two air-side systems with HSUPPLY specified in the
INP file.

**WARNING**********************************************************************

             User-specified HSUPPLY-CFM is larger than
             available return air.  Heating capacity may
             be inadequate.
I checked the BEPS report and it shows that
"PERCENT OF HOURS ANY SYSTEM ZONE OUTSIDE OF THROTTLING RANGE = 86.0
PERCENT OF HOURS ANY PLANT LOAD NOT SATISFIED                =  0.0"

2)  I tried increasing the "Pump Head" under "Domestic Water
Heater/Attachments" in the DDI from the default of 1 to several other
values, but the warning message always spits back a number that is 5 ft
greater than whatever I enter under "Pump Head".  E.g., I enter Pump Head =
100, it spits back a loop head of 105 in the warning message.
 **WARNING**********************************************************************
             Pump: DHW Loop Pump                    has a user-specified
head
             of         1. feet, but the loop head is       6. feet.

3)  Per a recommendation from Mike Tillou on the BLDG-SIM archive, I tried
changing all curves in the model to "default", but that did not remove the
following error message (which repeats for literally hundreds of pages).
CURINV: No real root for CURVE:
 1  1.353483  0.015932 -0.369414  0.000000  0.000000  0.000000
CURINV: No real root for CURVE:
 1  1.353483  0.015932 -0.369414  0.000000  0.000000  0.000000
CURINV: No real root for CURVE:
 1  1.353483  0.015932 -0.369414  0.000000  0.000000  0.000000


(Background):
Even though I think I've figured out the source of this warning message, I
thought I'd include it in case it's relevant to understanding the warning
messages above.

This warning is coming from the exhaust rates being specified higher than
outdoor air intake rates.
**WARNING**********************************************************************
             ZONE EL1 ESE Perim Zn ( G.ESE1)        in SYSTEM EL1 Sys1
(PTAC) (G.ESE1)
             has unused EXHAUST-CFM specified.
             This has been converted to outside air.

Thank you so much!  Looking forward to hearing back from those with
thoughts/insights/experiences on this.

Best,
Andy

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200707170427.AA2753343pd80001455246@gard.com>

Dear All,

 

Recently I requested help (and got it, thank you very much) with regard to the heating and cooling demand of a 20 sqm zone representing a room in a building with one fa?ade fully glazed and a fan coil unit specified. After consideration it was concluded that the heating demand calculated with eQuest was reasonable however the cooling demand was very very small. The chiller chosen was an electric-hermetic-reciprocating chiller (at random because I didn't know any better) with an EIR of 0.25 (COP=4.0) and after a long time investigating I changed the chiller to a electric-hermetic-centrifugal chiller and kept the EIR at 0.25. This resulted in the cooling load quadrupling! Does anybody know why this should be the case when every other parameter remained the same?

 

Kevin Burke

If return air is via plenum then the volume connected to the return  
air is the same.  My guess is that EQuest/2.2 does not try to do a  
CO2 balance and is thus working off occupant density and outdoor air  
(probably from mechanical systems only) so volume may be  
inconsequential.  For large spaces with transient occupancy this  
could be inaccurate - codes in Australia allow us to take advantage  
of this large volume of unvitiated air for theatre foyers etc.  If  
EQuest/2.2 did do a transient CO2 balance then the inaccurracies of  
modelling with no plenum would be limited to transient conditions  
which for offices would be morning, evening and lunch.  In this case  
I gues your simulation would be slightly optimistic.  I assume Steve  
Gates / Jeff Hirsch can clarify anything that isn't stated in the 2.2  
Dictionary.
Regards,
Graham

Lynn:
 
My interpretation of the NEW FEATURES section in DOE-2.2 explanation of
DCV is that it responds to the outside air requirement. The User decides
whether that is base on outside air per person or per square foot. So I
believe outside air has to be established on a CFM/person basis. The OSA
would not have any tie between to people if it was stated on a CFM/sf
basis.

Thanks to everyone who responded to the threads that came from the
original question. With respect to the note immediately below, how is
the demand for outside air determined when DCV is modeled in eQuest? I
was assuming the inputs would be the number of occupants (and their
activity levels) and the volume of the space. If deleted plenum volumes
are re-assigned to occupied spaces, the CO2 concentration (and
presumably OA fraction) should clearly be reduced in a real-life DCV
situation. Does the eQuest model of DCV take this into account or is it
more simplified?

John, that is a good point if your program is modeling the CO2
concentration explicitly.

 

If you (or simulation program) are using the scheduled quantity of
people as the surrogate for CO2 measurements then it would be the same
amount of OA with or without plenums.

 

(How ironic is that?  Using number of people in the model as the
surrogate for CO2 measurements...which in the real building is the
surrogate for the number of people...)

The plenums subtract from the total room volume.  If the return is
ducted, this makes a large difference.  Also while the plenum & room may
have the same or nearly the same temp/humidity, ventilation rates for
the room might be calculated based on a CO2 level difference.  The CO2
calculation is based on the room volume, which relates directly with OA
needed, and hence the energy to condition that OA.  The plenum can mean
a big difference in room volume flows when extrapolated across an entire
building.

Valid concerns, to be sure.  But are there not simpler ways to account
for the additional air and energy than carrying the additional
'overhead' (no pun intended) of plenums in a simulation?  And wouldn't
additional outside air tend to 'err' (no homophone intended) on the side
of conservancy when projecting energy consumption?  Lastly, when doing
comparative analyses, wouldn't the additional air (and energy) for the
plenums tend to 'cancel out'?
 
Am not suggesting omitting plenums for final, dialed-in load
calculations.  But for schematic design or design development-level
comparative energy analyses, dropping the plenums can save the analyst
significant speculative busy-work when extrapolated across a large
building.  
 
Just our methodology for the above types of projects, FWIW.

Lynn,

 

Do you really need the plenums?  Personally I find them non-value-added
for most of our energy study work.  Suggest specifying ceiling height
equal to floor-to-floor height in the DD wizard to make them disappear.

I am using eQuest to model an office building with 3 unique floors, many
spaces (with diff't use types) per floor and plenums between floors. I
have already defined the appropriate footprints for each floor and
imported them into a single model. NBD. Because there are many spaces
per floor and plenums assume the shape of the space they sit over, it
seemed like a good idea to import the plenums as separate, floor-shaped
spaces. This was to allow internal floors and ceilings of the non-plenum
spaces to be specified as NEXT-TO the appropriate plenum without any
concern for the shape of the plenum. If each space on, say, Floor1 had
an associated plenum reflecting the space shape, the spaces on Floor2
would not line up with those plenums. I defined neither a floor or
ceiling for the plenums so that interior floors and ceilings would be
part of the occupied spaces. As I'm sure many of you are thinking, DOE2
doesn't like that arrangement and requires at least two TILTs among the
interior surfaces, i.e. walls + floor, walls + ceiling or floor +
ceiling. If I put a floor in the 1st-floor plenum, I need to specify
which space it is NEXT-TO and the approach falls apart. Obviously, the
same deal applies to plenum ceilings. Has anyone got any ideas of how to
work around this? Is it better to just associate the plenums with the
spaces below them and let the chips fall where they may when the
separate floors are imported (i.e. can heat transfer from/to plenums be
ignored?)? Am I missing something really obvious?

 

Thanks in advance.

Hi Aleka,
 
A different sort of question comes to mind.  Once heated to 180F, what is
the fluid return temperature?  If above 110F it seems like it will heat the
geothermal loop from the boiler.  Another possibility is to select the
fan-coils units to work using the 110F supply.  Otherwise, the
fan-coil/boiler loop may need to be completely separate.
 
Good luck,

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] central heat pumps and circulation loops


Hi all,
I'm trying to model a central ground water source heat pump serving hot &
cold water loops for a radiant heating & cooling system in eQuest.  The 110
F hot water loop from the heat pump (loop to loop HP type chiller) serves
the radiant system directly, and has a secondary loop with a boiler attached
to it to bring the temperature up from 110 F to 180 F to serve some fan coil
units.  
I'm having a hard time configuring the loops and plant equipment to even
approximate this system.  Has anyone tried to model something like this in
eQuest?  From what I understanding, you can't put a boiler on a secondary
loop, and I'm hitting a wall with that.  If I put the boiler and the HP on
the same primary loop, I get errors that tell me 180 F is too high a
temperature for a GSHP water loop.  The closest I seem to be able to get is
to model the system with two separate HW loops - one for the fan coils with
only a boiler and one for the radiant system with the HP.  But, then I can't
use the heat pump to preheat for the FCU loop with this model.  

Any thoughts?

Thanks,
Aleka

As another example (since "a" is early in the series) if you chose to
use one of the most recent addenda such as "av", you do not have to use
all of the ones between "a" and "av".

The way it is written (and the way we've been instructed to review it as
USGBC LEED reviewers), you are permitted to apply any of the addenda to
your project.  However, for each addendum you choose to apply, the
entire addendum applies, and it applies to any other relevant LEED
points.  Paul's example is correct: since both the 25,000 square foot
threshold and the normalized glazing revision are included as part of
addendum a, you would have to follow both of these requirements if you
choose to apply that addendum to the project.  However, you are not
required to apply other addenda to the project just because you chose to
follow addendum a.

Paul,

My interpretation of the USGBC ruling is the same as yours, I think.
You 
cannot pick and choose which items in ASHRAE addenda to use on your LEED
project.  You have to choose either 90.1-2004 with no addenda or
90.1-2004
with addenda which would include ALL the published adddenda that apply
to 
ALL chapters of 90.1-2004 not just Appendix G.  There are currently 42
addenda to ASHRAE 90.1-2004 (a-v,x,y,aa-ae,ag-ar,av...I hope I didn't
miss
any) This decision would also impact your compliance with the EA energy 
performance pre-requisite.

As you said "messy".

I think that all the 90.1-2004 addenda will eventually be published as
ASHRAE 90.1-2007 which will simplify keeping track of all the changes.

Mike

Has anyone read the fine print referenced in these strings to reach this
conclusion:

If you are modeling under 90.1-2004 Appendix G for LEED and opt to not 
normalize the glazing by orientation under addendum a, then you must
also
except the other portions of addendum a, most notably the revised area
threshold of 25,000 sf for the base HVAC system in Table G3.1.1A.

It seems like a messy and perhaps unintentional convergence of standard
and
policy adoption but it also seems like it is there in black and white.
Any
other conclusions?

Thanks,

The requirement to  distribute fenestration uniformly in horizontal
bands
across the four orientations has been removed from Appendix G in the 
published Addenda Supplement to 90.1, 2004. See the ASHRAE website for
the
supplement.

>>> Chris Jones <cj at cr-jay.ca> 5/16/2007 9:56:02 AM >>> 
Appendix G notes that for the Baseline building: "Vertical fenestration
areas for new buildings and additions shall equal that in the proposed
design or 40% of gross above grade wall area, whichever is smaller, and 
shall be distributed uniformly in horizontal bands across the four
orientations."
Does this mean that the Baseline building gets windows on all walls on
each
orientation whether or not the Design case has a window in all walls on
each 
orientation.  For example, if the west orientation has 30% glazing
overall
but many spaces have no windows - some walls on the west face have more
that
30%.  Do those spaces in the Baseline case get 30% glazing?  Or do I
only 
put windows in the Baseline case where there are windows in the Design
case.

Thanks for any help!

Thanks Gail very much for the notification,

And thanks to whomever was responsible for convincing USGBC to amend the

process.  Seems like just a month ago I was railing on about this very
topic; now I'm out of excuses for not drafting up an ASHRAE 90.1
Appendix G
amendment to address shortcomings in the baseline building rotation 
exercise.

Decision impacting EAc1 Credit )


Dear Fellow Energy modelers,

The following posting has been placed on the USGBC website (
http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=2664 ), which allows the
use of
ASHRAE Addenda for all credits referencing ASHRAE standards.


Use of approved Addenda for ASHRAE Standards referenced in LEED

Background:
ASHRAE currently publishes Continuous Maintenance standards every three 
years, with a Supplement published eighteen months after the Standard is
published. In rare cases, addenda are published in between the
eighteen-month periods. LEED development and ASHRAE standards
development
are not aligned and many addenda have been approved that would be useful
for
LEED project teams.

Action:
LEED project teams are required to use the ASHRAE Standard referenced in
the
applicable Reference Guide and are permitted to use addenda within the
most 
recent Supplement to that Standard, as well as any approved addenda
published in between the eighteen-month periods. Project teams are
responsible for notifying LEED reviewers of the use of ASHRAE addenda
utilized at the time of project documentation submission. 
If a project team elects to use an addendum to an ASHRAE Standard, this
addendum must be applied to the entire LEED submittal.
This should make fenestration modeling much easier for the Baseline Case
for
projects opting to follow the Addendum.

Lynn,
 
Do you really need the plenums?  Personally I find them non-value-added
for most of our energy study work.  Suggest specifying ceiling height
equal to floor-to-floor height in the DD wizard to make them disappear.

I am using eQuest to model an office building with 3 unique floors, many
spaces (with diff't use types) per floor and plenums between floors. I
have already defined the appropriate footprints for each floor and
imported them into a single model. NBD. Because there are many spaces
per floor and plenums assume the shape of the space they sit over, it
seemed like a good idea to import the plenums as separate, floor-shaped
spaces. This was to allow internal floors and ceilings of the non-plenum
spaces to be specified as NEXT-TO the appropriate plenum without any
concern for the shape of the plenum. If each space on, say, Floor1 had
an associated plenum reflecting the space shape, the spaces on Floor2
would not line up with those plenums. I defined neither a floor or
ceiling for the plenums so that interior floors and ceilings would be
part of the occupied spaces. As I'm sure many of you are thinking, DOE2
doesn't like that arrangement and requires at least two TILTs among the
interior surfaces, i.e. walls + floor, walls + ceiling or floor +
ceiling. If I put a floor in the 1st-floor plenum, I need to specify
which space it is NEXT-TO and the approach falls apart. Obviously, the
same deal applies to plenum ceilings. Has anyone got any ideas of how to
work around this? Is it better to just associate the plenums with the
spaces below them and let the chips fall where they may when the
separate floors are imported (i.e. can heat transfer from/to plenums be
ignored?)? Am I missing something really obvious?
 
Thanks in advance.

Paul,

My interpretation of the USGBC ruling is the same as yours, I think.  You
cannot pick and choose which items in ASHRAE addenda to use on your LEED
project.  You have to choose either 90.1-2004 with no addenda or 90.1-2004
with addenda which would include ALL the published adddenda that apply to
ALL chapters of 90.1-2004 not just Appendix G.  There are currently 42
addenda to ASHRAE 90.1-2004 (a-v,x,y,aa-ae,ag-ar,av...I hope I didn't miss
any) This decision would also impact your compliance with the EA energy
performance pre-requisite. 

As you said "messy".

I think that all the 90.1-2004 addenda will eventually be published as
ASHRAE 90.1-2007 which will simplify keeping track of all the changes.  

Regards,

Mike

Has anyone read the fine print referenced in these strings to reach this

If you are modeling under 90.1-2004 Appendix G for LEED and opt to not
normalize the glazing by orientation under addendum a, then you must also
except the other portions of addendum a, most notably the revised area
threshold of 25,000 sf for the base HVAC system in Table G3.1.1A.

It seems like a messy and perhaps unintentional convergence of standard and

Dear Fellow Energy modelers,

The following posting has been placed on the USGBC website (
http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=2664), which allows the use of
ASHRAE Addenda for all credits referencing ASHRAE standards.


Use of approved Addenda for ASHRAE Standards referenced in LEED

Background:
ASHRAE currently publishes Continuous Maintenance standards every three
years, with a Supplement published eighteen months after the Standard is
published. In rare cases, addenda are published in between the
eighteen-month periods. LEED development and ASHRAE standards development
are not aligned and many addenda have been approved that would be useful for
LEED project teams.

Action:
LEED project teams are required to use the ASHRAE Standard referenced in the
applicable Reference Guide and are permitted to use addenda within the most
recent Supplement to that Standard, as well as any approved addenda
published in between the eighteen-month periods. Project teams are
responsible for notifying LEED reviewers of the use of ASHRAE addenda
utilized at the time of project documentation submission.
If a project team elects to use an addendum to an ASHRAE Standard, this
addendum must be applied to the entire LEED submittal.
This should make fenestration modeling much easier for the Baseline Case for
projects opting to follow the Addendum.




Best Regards,

Gail Stranske

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] central heat pumps and circulation loops
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200707121202.AA0259828pd80001452992@gard.com>

Hi all,
I'm trying to model a central ground water source heat pump serving hot &
cold water loops for a radiant heating & cooling system in eQuest.  The 110
F hot water loop from the heat pump (loop to loop HP type chiller) serves
the radiant system directly, and has a secondary loop with a boiler attached
to it to bring the temperature up from 110 F to 180 F to serve some fan coil
units.
I'm having a hard time configuring the loops and plant equipment to even
approximate this system.  Has anyone tried to model something like this in
eQuest?  From what I understanding, you can't put a boiler on a secondary
loop, and I'm hitting a wall with that.  If I put the boiler and the HP on
the same primary loop, I get errors that tell me 180 F is too high a
temperature for a GSHP water loop.  The closest I seem to be able to get is
to model the system with two separate HW loops - one for the fan coils with
only a boiler and one for the radiant system with the HP.  But, then I can't
use the heat pump to preheat for the FCU loop with this model.

Any thoughts?

Thanks,
Aleka

FYI

ASHRAE has developed a toolkit for calculating loadshapes from 8760 data, RP1093. You can get a copy of the toolkit by contacting Mike Vaughn at ASHRAE. The toolkit uses an interquartile analysis to calc the load shapes and also produces a snippet of DOE-2, BLAST and EP code with the coded loadshape. The final report and 2 papers also have a literature search that contains refs to other studies.

All, 

 

We are trying to verify if its possible to smooth out 8760 load shape in eQUEST to represent the a wider population versus a single building. DOE2 is this an option (I believe), but it is still possible in eQUEST. Our issue is this, when generating 8760 load shape profile, the output file produces a load shape that reflects the load shape associated with a single structure. However, what we want would be a load shape that captures the variability in the operating schedules associated with buildings in the population.  We would be very interested to know how and if this is possible to smooth the load shape generated in eQUEST.  Thank you,

Thanks Gail very much for the notification,

And thanks to whomever was responsible for convincing USGBC to amend the
process.  Seems like just a month ago I was railing on about this very
topic; now I'm out of excuses for not drafting up an ASHRAE 90.1
Appendix G amendment to address shortcomings in the baseline building
rotation exercise.

Dear Fellow Energy modelers,

The following posting has been placed on the USGBC website (
http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=2664), which allows the
use of ASHRAE Addenda for all credits referencing ASHRAE standards.


Use of approved Addenda for ASHRAE Standards referenced in LEED

Background:
ASHRAE currently publishes Continuous Maintenance standards every three
years,
with a Supplement published eighteen months after the Standard is
published. In rare
cases, addenda are published in between the eighteen-month periods. LEED
development and ASHRAE standards development are not aligned and many
addenda
have been approved that would be useful for LEED project teams.

Action:
LEED project teams are required to use the ASHRAE Standard referenced in
the
applicable Reference Guide and are permitted to use addenda within the
most recent
Supplement to that Standard, as well as any approved addenda published
in between the
eighteen-month periods. Project teams are responsible for notifying LEED
reviewers of
the use of ASHRAE addenda utilized at the time of project documentation
submission.
If a project team elects to use an addendum to an ASHRAE Standard, this
addendum
must be applied to the entire LEED submittal.
This should make fenestration modeling much easier for the Baseline Case
for projects opting to follow the Addendum.




Best Regards,

Gail Stranske

I would have thought the 300 of 8,760 would be on a zone by zone  
basis and then system by system basis so number of zones shouldn't  
impact it.  But I practice in Australia and I haven't looked through  
90.1 since the 1989 revision when I was in Canada ... so just an  
opinion.

Also the SS-R report is very useful, particularly for VAV systems.   
It will show you how the zone air volumes are distributed as a % of  
design and reports loads under-cooled and under-heated by zone.   
However a few years back I came across a lot of hours under-heated or  
under-cooled and couldn't work out why.  Turns out it includes any  
hours the fans run which could be for night purge when setpoints are  
not being held.  To my knowledge this hasn't been changed.  I am  
unsure whether loads not met works the same way (i.e. includes night  
purge hours) ...

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200707101649.AA4903546pd80001452028@gard.com>

FYI...

 

This would be really tricky...in EQUEST, as in DOE-2, one would need to
make sure the CWFs are turned on, and all walls, roofs, etc. are
layered. In addition, one would need proper framing-factors for the
walls, and if the building is slab on grade, effective u-values
following Winklemann's method. One would need to look at the BDL to
ascertain this.

 

Then comes the fun part...since a simulation like DOE-2 or EQUEST might
not really be simulating what is going on, one need to have "effective
parameters" for the coupling of the thermal mass to the interior node,
etc. 

 

For example, see the paper by Janet Manke and Doug Hittle in the 1985
ASME Conference proceedings that used "effective" parameters to best
represent the thermal mass, convection and radiation exchange within a
building. There are other papers that have addressed this issue using
TRNSYS by Jim Braun, et al. in the ASHRAE literature. I believe there
was also an ASHRAE Research Project on this as well.

 

Beware....

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Modeling Thermal Mass in eQUEST

 

All,

 

We're trying to model thermal mass effects on load shifting for a
non-residential building for the Savings By Design program.

 

Title-24 references tables for thermal mass savings for low-rise
residential depending on the constructions present.  From my
understanding, EnergyPro follows the ways of the T-24 energy code, and
really doesn't model thermal mass for what it is.  

 

I know eQUEST requires the "Layers Input" for the program to assign a
mass to the construction (and not the "U-Value Input").  

 

Does eQUEST also reference tables (similar to the T-24 energy code), or
are there some genuine calculations made?

 

Thanks again,

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200707101631.AA311178pd80001451995@gard.com>

All, 

 

We are trying to verify if its possible to smooth out 8760 load shape in
eQUEST to represent the a wider population versus a single building.
DOE2 is this an option (I believe), but it is still possible in eQUEST.
Our issue is this, when generating 8760 load shape profile, the output
file produces a load shape that reflects the load shape associated with
a single structure. However, what we want would be a load shape that
captures the variability in the operating schedules associated with
buildings in the population.  We would be very interested to know how
and if this is possible to smooth the load shape generated in eQUEST.
Thank you,

Greetings BLDG-SIMmers,
 
Has anyone run across an explanation/quantification of how an effective thermal break might be provided for metal studs installed for furring on the inside of existing concrete walls? 
 
An architect's detail from outside to inside, shows an existing 8" concrete walls abutted against a 3-5/8" metal studs with furring installed 24" o/c with batt insulation, and gyp board for the finished side. The overall U-value is certainly a lot better than the bare concrete, but it would be improved if the metal studs weren't in direct contact with the concrete. 
 
Any thoughts on how to quantify this arrangements?

In DOE2.1E and in DOE2.2/eQuest, you can view the number of unmet loads
hours on a zone-by-zone basis in the SS-F report. This reports the
number of hours that the zone loads were not met broken down by month
and by category (i.e. heating or cooling).

In addition, the BEPU report gives you the total of unmet loads hours as
a percentage for the system simulation and the central plant simulation.
Be aware that the system unmet loads fraction can be misleading as it is
the number of zone loads not met by the system summed over all the
zones. Therefore, if one zone has unmet loads for 8760 hours then the
fraction will be reported as 100% even if all the other zones have zero
unmet loads. 

With regard to the loads not met by the plant in the BEPU report, if
these occur at the same time as an unmet system load there will be
double counting of loads not met by the simulation.

My own view is that the Appendix G definition of unmet loads unfairly
penalises simulations with large numbers of zones. For example, in a 10
zone simulation, each zone would need to have 30 hours with unmet loads
to reach the 300 hour limit. But in a simulation with 100 zones each
zone would only need 3 hours of unmet loads to reach 300 unmet loads
hours. 

If I were to rewrite the relevant section of Appendix G to correct this
problem I would multiply the number of hours of unmet load for each zone
by that zone's fraction of building floor area. This would normalise the
measurement of unmet loads to the size of the building and the number of
zones in the simulation so that the maximum possible percentage of unmet
loads would be 100%.

You can click on the building level in the left-hand panel explorer when
you are in the air-side module of eQuest, and then go to the summary
tab.  It will summarize the zones and systems that have unmet loads.

(If you have selected a particular air system in the explorer you will
get the summary for only that system rather than all of the systems.)

I haven't experimented enough to know how it calculates the "building
total" unmet hours...if simultaneous unmet zones/systems count double or
not.  It does provide an overall project system unmet hours for you to
use.

The temperature and humidity reports are also useful in the full output
-- in the sim viewer program you can scroll through the zones with the
down arrow once you've selected the desired report to spot any irregular
temperatures.  This might be hard to spot that one spurious hour, but it
will help you see if you are getting a lot of unmet hours at a time you
thought the system was supposed to off for example, or if the unmet
hours are at start-up.  Or perhaps there is a zone that has high
temperatures in winter due to a west facing window and the cooling is
off.

Last idea, make sure you have consistent zone setpoint schedules and
zone design heating and cooling temperatures.  Maybe you have changed
the setpoint schedules during the project and not gone back to the
design setpoint to make the corresponding change.

 Hello,

 

I have been trying to model water-to-water gshp in a heating only
residential building, supplemented with a boiler and feeds into baseboard
heating and a rooftop make up air unit for air-side.  The system has heat
recovery and there is no cooling.

 

Thus far I have only been able to connect a lake/well ground source heat
exchanger to a chiller via cold water loop.  I have the chiller equipment
capacity at zero to resemble no cooling.  The airside rooftop unit I am
using is of type packaged single zone and has the hot water loop connected
to the heating coil and baseboard.

 

I have confirmed with a colleague who is also modeling water-to-water heat
pumps from a ground source heat exchanger that this would be the way to do
it.

 

Would psz be appropriate for the airside system type, the only compliable
choices or PVAV PVVT and PSZ and this is not a variable volume?

 

Please let me know if I need to clarify anything further.  I would
appreciate hearing any insight on this situation and modeling water-to-water
gshp. Thank you.

 

 

Kevin

Kristin:

Thanks for your reply. I will forward your response to the list.

If the standards only address sensible load, I'm wondering whether the Unmet Load Hours is sufficient to evaluate the performance of a HVAC system, especially in humid climate where indoor humidity control is an essential part of the HVAC system. Since indoor humidity control may consume significant energy depending on the equipment/system used, I think the unmet latent load or the indoor humidity level should also be accounted for in the building energy performance evaluation to get fair comparison between proposed and baseline building designs.

Xiaobing,

I tried to send this email to the list, but there's a
glitch that doesn't allow my messages to get through. 
Anyway, here's my response for you at least:

My interpretation is that the standard is addressing
sensible load only and that it is for building-wide
hours of load unmet, not by zone.  Anyone disagree?

For eQUEST/DOE-2.2, this would mean that I'd say to
use the number on the BEPS report instead of from the
SS-R reports (although those are very helpful to look
at for other reasons).

Elliot:
 
Simple as pie.
 
The Design Development Wizard (DD Wizard) allows one to draw different
shell (floors, if you will) shapes, which can be either separate
buildings or separate floors. You can also import AutoCAD .DWG files to
trace each floor from.
 
I believe eQuest Tutorial Item Tab 3 (Example: 7th and Lane) outlines a
bit of how to approach the DD Wizard route.
 
Any building I have now usually starts in the Schematic design Wizard,
then goes to the DD Wizard to traces the floors and/or multiple
buildings. Once I have the building "cookie cuttered" out, I dive
straight to the Detailed Interface to finalize my inputs.
 
You'll get the hang of it.

The few LEED projects I've modeled for (3), we've used unmet load for
hours for the whole building.  I like to use the Summary Tab under the
Air-Side HVAC screen to view details about my systems including unmet
load hours.  The only thing is that it's only available for the baseline
design and can't compare with any parametric runs.

I usually look through the zone report (SS-H? - the one which shows the
undercooled or underheated hours for each zone) to see if any zone has
unreasonably high numbers. Fixing these zones usually gets me a very low
number for unmet hours for the total of all zones. I would be curious to

overall wall. Uavg = U1A1 + U2A2+U3A3+... See ASHRAE 2005
Fundamentals?CH25. Depending on the level of analysis you are looking
at?UA calcs v potential moisture issues, a computer model may be
necessary.
 
Any further input on this is appreciated...

I usually look through the zone report (SS-H? - the one which shows the undercooled or underheated hours for each zone) to see if any zone has unreasonably high numbers. Fixing these zones usually gets me a very low number for unmet hours for the total of all zones. I would be curious to see what others have to suggest. In your case, going through 76 zones would be quite tedious.

ASHRAE 90.1-2004 has design criteria for Equipment capacities on Page 176 of the Standard (G3.1.2.2). It talks about Unmet load hours on the proposed design AND the baseline design not exceeding 300 hrs (of 8,760 Hrs), and the delta between base and proposed not differing more than 50 hours.
 
Is this WHOLE BUILDING, or BY ZONE? I have 76 zones in my building, and to play the Unmet loads game between these two models is harder than trying to hold water in my hands.
 
Any thoughts, interpretations, or suggestions?

Greetings BLDG-SIMmers,
 
Has anyone run across an explanation/quantification of how an effective thermal break might be provided for metal studs installed for furring on the inside of existing concrete walls? 
 
An architect's detail from outside to inside, shows an existing 8" concrete walls abutted against a 3-5/8" metal studs with furring installed 24" o/c with batt insulation, and gyp board for the finished side. The overall U-value is certainly a lot better than the bare concrete, but it would be improved if the metal studs weren't in direct contact with the concrete. 
 
Any thoughts on how to quantify this arrangements?

Dear All,
  I am trying to do a building complex in Equest but run into some sort of a visualization problem. The program is not able to refresh the 3dmode hence making me impossible to edit the building envelope.
   
  -Can any of you suggest the maximum input file lengths that Equest can successfuly handle. (Its presently processing some 20000 lines)
  I am working on a P4,dual core processor with 2GB RAM- can the computer speed be a factor here?

Hello Tara,
 
See screen 23 of the eQuest DD wizard.  There is an input for exterior
lighting in watts per square foot for the selected shell.  This
unfortunately is not the way exterior power is more generally
characterized, namely as watts per linear foot of perimeter.  
 
The input number is stored in the pd2 file, and is multiplied by the
shell square footage to obtain the EXTERIOR-POWER value in kilowatts
found in the inp file.  The EXT-USAGE keyword looks like it's used only
to assign exterior power to a particular electric meter.
 
Generally I assign all the exterior lighting load to the first floor
Shell.  You might try entering the data as described above into the
wizard, then saving the file and searching for the keywords you're
looking for in the inp file to see the syntax of how they're used.
 
HTH...

Hello Analyst/Engineers,

 

Need input on how to model fireplace and the dedicated exhaust fan.

It is 300,000Btu/h gas fire place that is used for esthetical only. All
heat is being exhausted through the chimney with 3200cfm VSD exhaust
fan.  

1.	Can somebody point me how to model this in eQuest?
2.	Since it is not used for heating purposes, I assume it should be

Any input is greatly appreciated.

Vikram,

The second answer is correct, i.e. the bhp goes in as a numerator. (746*BHP)/(1-EXP{[-0.243789*LN(BHP)]-1.685541})

I figured it out by trial and error. In one case that when I used the bhp in the denominator, the fan power increased 3 to 4 times. That immediately added heat to the supply air stream and terminated my simulation run due to an error. I hope the equation is clarified better in the next version of the document.

bests,
Neeraj

Question about Fan Power


 
 




So I'm trying to calculate fan power, and came across this mindbender



Pfan = 746 / (1 - e[ -0.2437839 ? ln( bhp ) - 1.685541 ]) ? bhp



Having done the hard part (I figured out how to automate the process in XL with just the CFM input using the natural log function ), I have only one question - does the bhp (highlighted at the end) go in the numerator or denominator of the equation?


i.e. - Should the equation read



Pfan = 746 / [(1 - e[ -0.2437839 ? ln( bhp ) - 1.685541 ]) ? bhp]



Or



Pfan = [746 / (1 - e[ -0.2437839 ? ln( bhp ) - 1.685541 ])] ? bhp



Any help is much appreciated.



Thanks

Assuming an approximate conversion at 746 W per BHP - numerator, which is divided by some motor efficiency corrections (all the logarithmic stuff) to get your Pfan in Watts.

 

For instance with 50 BHP, your numbers might give you something similar to:  746 / 0.929 x 50 = Pfan = 40.2 kW

So I'm trying to calculate fan power, and came across this mindbender 

Pfan = 746 / (1 - e[ -0.2437839 ? ln( bhp ) - 1.685541 ]) ? bhp 

Having done the hard part (I figured out how to automate the process in XL with just the CFM input using the natural log function ), I have only one question - does the bhp (highlighted at the end) go in the numerator or denominator of the equation?

i.e. - Should the equation read 

Pfan = 746 / [(1 - e[ -0.2437839 ? ln( bhp ) - 1.685541 ]) ? bhp] 

Or 

Pfan = [746 / (1 - e[ -0.2437839 ? ln( bhp ) - 1.685541 ])] ? bhp

BHP must be in the numerator else it would take less power to run motors of increasing horsepower, QED?

Dear all,

How is an overhead plenum zone (unconditioned) accommodated in Ecotect? I
see that when I draw a zone, unlike in eQUEST, there's no distinction
between floor-to-floor height and floor-to-ceiling height.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200707051004.AA0440578pd80001449096@gard.com>

I am having a problem modeling a dedicated outside air handling unit in
Equest. I have followed past advice from this mailing list and also the
DOE2.2 manuals, but the OAHU is not sized correctly in my simulation
runs.
 
I have specified a constant OAcfm/sqft in each zone to simulate a
constant volume unit, and the air handling units served by the OAHU link
to it with the OA-From command. But there appears to be a problem in
that the OAHU will fail to recognize the zone OA requirements from zones
defined by floor multipliers, and therefore it is not sized properly.
For example, my 10 story building (Ground, Mid (x8), Top) will have the
OAHU sized for 3 floors only (Ground, Mid, Top).
 
Has anyone out there experienced this same problem, or know of any way
to resolve it?
 
Thanks in advance,

Dear colleagues,
 
It is my pleasure to announce to you the release of Daylight 1-2-3, a
new daylighting/energy analysis software developed jointly by the
National Research Council Canada and Natural Resources Canada. The tool
predicts the daylighting and energy performance of sidelit and/or toplit
private offices, open plan offices, and classrooms. Daylight 1-2-3 comes
with an intuitive graphical user interface and extensive help files and
should take you less than 30 minutes to learn. 
 
Daylight 1-2-3 uses a customized version of ESP-r that reads in
RADIANCE/DAYSIM-based daylight coefficients and uses the occupant
behavior model Lightswitch to predict the energy saving potential of
automated lighting controls such as occupancy sensors and
photocell-controlled dimming. Simulation outputs include the latest
generation of climate-based daylight performance metrics such as
continuous daylight autonomy, useful daylight index, and daylight
saturation percentage as well as monthly energy loads for heating,
lighting, and cooling. The effect of venetian blinds is modeled using
the SKYVISION software. For a full overview of the software please refer
to http://lightswitch.irc.nrc.ca/website/p233v1.pdf.
 
You can download the software free-of-charge from www.daylight1-2-3.com.
The software is currently available under WINDOWS only.
 
Your comments and suggestions are welcome. 
 
Happy simulations,
 

The Daylight 1-2-3 Development Team

While elevator energy use is somewhat a function of installed  
connected load it is all a function of how people move through the  
building.  Vertical transporartion is by far the most uncertain base  
building energy end use in office buildings.

We have seen a wide variation in energy use on a m2 NLA pa basis.  On  
the low end a government building with small floorplates and tenants  
who tend not to move around the building vertically other than to eat  
and go to and from work could be around 2 kWh/m2 NLA pa.  On the high  
end a CBD location with small floorplates and a tenant who is  
externally focussed (i.e. has clients / customers regularly coming  
and going) with the coffee shop at ground level could be 10 kWh/m2  
NLA pa or more.  I have heard of buildings with older control gear  
and drives that can use far more than this.

Our Lend Lease headquarters at 30 The Bond in Sydney has open  
staircases that we use to go 2-3 floors up or down.  Most people walk  
to work and arrive at the L4 entrance and thus rarely use the lifts.  
As a result while we meet a lot and have a lot of visitors our lift  
energy use is actually very low.

Richard Peters in the UK and others have been doing a lot of research  
into predicting lift energy use - interesting stuff.  Some of the  
lift manufacturers have software now that they will either use in a  
consultancy role or license to consultants to allow annual energy sue  
to be estimated from lift simulations and empirical data of how  
people typically move through buildings.

Graham

Vikram---

 

The horsepower input to an elevator can vary quite a bit depending on
the building.  For a high rise building, elevators will typically be
rated at 50 hp each (37 kW).  This goes down incrementally with the size
of the building to about 10 hp for small elevators (7.5 kW).  These are
just numbers I have seen on projects in-house. You should try to contact
the electrical engineer for your project and they should be able to give
you a better idea of how the elevators are rated.

Regarding your elevator question, eQUEST has a set of library schedules
for elevator usage in several types of buildings (office, apartments,
etc.)  These seem reasonable and appear to be based off of the ASHRAE
schedules that are found in the 90.1-2004 User's Manual.

Going through the LEED 2.2 requirements, I see that site lighting needs
to be modeled as well. Has anyone done this in eQUEST? If so - how is it
modeled? Do you set up another lighting source with schedule? I looked
in the project & site requirements and didn't see a site lighting
option.

Also - I am assuming you model elevators in the internal loads/equipment
tab. Does anyone have experience scheduling elevator usage? What kind of
schedule do you set for them?

Lastly - the baseline requirements for Appendix G requires that there is
no self shading. Can you set that in eQUEST?

David,

I am struggling with modeling ice storage correctly as well.

But to get a fair understanding of how to go about it, refer to the
example in the DOE2 docs available in the eQUEST download area (DOE22
topics has an example input, also the DOE22 dictionary talks about
thermal storage and how its to be modeled)

The trick really lies in how you control the ice storage after having
defined it! In my case, even though the ice storage seems to be working
(not the way I would have imagined it to work though!) the chiller usage
is not going down!! Which is definitely an anomaly..

See if you can understand and use the example to your benefit....do let
me know if it works for you.

 

For the GSHP system as well, look up an example input in the DOE22
documents, though I am not sure if you still need to import the curves
for gshp systems in the latest eQUEST version. Maybe someone has
answers?

 

Good luck

Alpana

Dear all,

 

I need to model a ice storage system and a ground souce heat pump system
in eQUEST. I have been trying to model these two systems for quite a
while but I could find enough information to model these two features.
Does someone has detail information about how to model these two systems
or someone has some example files that I take as a reference.

 

Thank you very much in advance. I really appreciate your help.

Hi Gang:
 
I am modeling a brand new multi story museum in eQuest in a 4 season
climate. The Museum has several atriums, some two story and some three
story. I have been making the atriums vertically multizoned, removing
the floors and ceilings, and creating airwalls between the atriums
levels.  I have conditioned all bottom atrium floors, conditioned the
2nd floors of the 3 story atriums, but have left the top floors of ALL
atriums unconditioned.
 
My difficulties are twofold:
 
1) This is to be an eventual LEED application, so ASHRAE 90.1-2004 is
the base building. This requires eQuest sized airflows for a 20 Deg
delta T, coil to room temperature.
 
This is resulting in airflows that are 60% down to 30% of what the
Design shows.
 
2) I also seem to undercooking many of the spaces, including the
atriums.
 
Am I modeling these atriums correctly?
 
I don't have much time to make changes, so any help is greatly
appreciated.

John,
 
My thought was that we're not so much cooling and heating the entire
space as treating it as a contiguous entity.  Can anyone outside of
Scott Criswell say with certainty that air floors and air ceilings
permit connected multifloor spaces to behave thermodynamically
equivalent to multilevel spaces?  If so, or Scott if you're out there,
please advise.  Since shells can be placed anywhere, it seems to me
there would have to be sophisticated geometrical checking between spaces
within shells to make it work.
 
Admittedly I'm usually modeling two-level spaces -- gymnasiums
cafeterias etc. so perhaps when I say the method I use produces results
that are within expectations, my expectation bar is set rather low.
 
As for underheating, on several projects I have added baseboards to
eliminate the underheating warnings/errors in the simulation report.
While it get the heating load up in the ballpark of where it needs to
be, its not a perfect solution -- but as you say... deadlines!
 
Brandon

That should be "under heating."
 
I have seen your Atrium suggestions before. You seem to be cooling and
heating the entire atrium, which I do not believe is the case,
especially in the 3 story set up.
 
I don't have the time to rebuild my model, sad to say. deadlines..

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Museum with multi Story Atriums - Low airflows..

Hi Gang:
 
I am modeling a brand new multi story museum in eQuest in a 4 season
climate. The Museum has several atriums, some two story and some three
story. I have been making the atriums vertically multizoned, removing
the floors and ceilings, and creating airwalls between the atriums
levels.  I have conditioned all bottom atrium floors, conditioned the
2nd floors of the 3 story atriums, but have left the top floors of ALL
atriums unconditioned.
 
My difficulties are twofold:
 
1) This is to be an eventual LEED application, so ASHRAE 90.1-2004 is
the base building. This requires eQuest sized airflows for a 20 Deg
delta T, coil to room temperature.
 
This is resulting in airflows that are 60% down to 30% of what the
Design shows.
 
2) I also seem to undercooking many of the spaces, including the
atriums.
 
Am I modeling these atriums correctly?
 
I don't have much time to make changes, so any help is greatly
appreciated.

I would think that for the base building, its ok to do just one (since
you have to run each orientation and average it, and since you discount
self shading). The designed building will self shade though, so you
might want to build that into the study. Might not be that significant
though (might not be worth the effort of modeling all buildings).

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] appartment complex energy model for LEED



This is an apartment building complex with identical buildings in
different orientations. To do energy analysis for LEED in eQUEST does
one need to model the entire complex (all buildings together)? Or can
one just model one of the typical buildings and run that model in the
various orientations and sum up energy use?

Is there a certain requirement for LEED?

Thanks

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200707301533.AA3324390pd80001463002@gard.com>

Dear all,

I'm facing some challenges with Ecotect, partly because of my limited
familiarity with the tool. Specifically with a US building in mind, I need
your input on the following:

1. Is it possible to get a Btu number for whole building energy consumption
directly out of the software? (as opposed to the exclusive heating and
cooling Btus output in the thermal analysis tab)
2. Is it possible to associate a utility rate, time of use or linear, and
get a total dollar number for annual utility cost - for instance as required
by ASHRAE energy cost budget/Appendix G?
3. Is it possible to get a number for peak electric demand as opposed to
just peak cooling load?

Thanks,

Ramana Koti, LEED AP

Has anyone tried using EnergyPlus in a multi-cpu / shared memory system
environment? Most new CPUs are dual core or quad core. So running a
simulation on these computers will only use, at best 50% of the CPU
resources. So this is a great way to speed up the simulation run-time.
 
I'm spec-ing out the requirements to get ESP-r to take advantage of this
since both the Intel and gcc 4.2 compilers support the OpenMP standard,
and was wondering if EnergyPlus already allows for this.

I ran into this once on  lab project in the northwest (mild climate).  Turned out the higher performance glazing was trapping the high internal heat gains. Higher cooling energy and lower heating energy.

If cooling load is increasing with decreasing SC that would seem to
suggest that your lights are going on for more hours, check your day
lighting settings (if on).  Also, with such high U-factors, the ambient
air ( I am assuming a warm hot climate ) may be also adding to your
cooling load.
 
Try adding some exterior shades and see what happens.

Just a theory, but do you have the daylighting option turned on? If so -
the visible transmittance (I am assuming Glass 2 is darker) will make a
difference. It will increase your lighting load, and in turn your
cooling load.

Oos.  That's 55 lbs/hr total, not per sf.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200707300848.AA4816296pd80001462450@gard.com>

Hello All,

Has anyone modeled a pool in eQuest?  I am modeling a space that contains a
24 X 44 foot pool.  I'm estimating 55 lbs/hr of evaporation per sf of
surface area (for any period of time when the pool is uncoverd).  At a
minimum I need to model space dehumidification and the energy needed to heat
the pool and replacement water.  I checked the help files and am using a
reheat fan system, as suggested.

I can simply input a latent load into the space to simmulate the humidity,
and manually calculate and input an energy load for pool heat, but I'd like
to do better.

Thanks,

What I did is define a new glass type with simplied method in detailed
model. Then replace the old glass with the new defined one. Can this do? How
to avoid the defauls percolate through the program? I check again and find
that there was no wrong with the conduction heat and solar radiation through
window .But the load due to occupancy /lighting/euqipment of Glass Type II
is higher than Glass Type I . And the cooling energy of Glass type II is a
little highter. It make me confused. Why the load due to  due to occupancy
/lighting/euqipment  was different when Glass type changed.

And I doubt if the problem has something to do with OA load .

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200707290052.AA5216984pd80001462081@gard.com>

Dear all

I have tried to compare the energy consumption between two different glass
types and got a curious result. The parameters of these two glasses are
listed below:

1) Coated U=2.5 SC=0.45
2) low-e U=1.76 SC=0.44

I thought the energy consumption of Glass Type II would be lower than that
of Glass Type I . But the result is the cooling energy of Glass Type II is
higher than  that of Glass Type I , and the heating energy lower than that
of Glass Type I.

I have no idea of this. And I checked LS-F/ SS-D / BEPS and found some
points listed below

1) in LS-F annual sensible  cooling load of Glass Type II is lower than that
of Glass Type I , latent cooling load of Glass Type II is higher. The total
annual cooling load of Glass Type II is a little higher

2) in SS-D monthly cooling energy of Glass Type II is  higher

3) dencity and schedule of occupancy /lighting /euqipment are the same in
the two models , but cooling load and heating load due to these indoor
factors are different , why?

4) monthly schedule of occupancy /lighting /euqipment  is all the same
during the year, but cooling load and heating load due to these indoor
factors are different every month, why?

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200707271721.AA2151859pd80001461815@gard.com>

Hello,
 
I'm using BEOpt to model packed earth structures as part of my masters project with walls up to 3' thick.  For walls over 2', I get a DOE 2 error that says the wall is "too thick or too dense" and then the simulation ceases  Is there a way to prevent this from happening?  
 
A compromise I am considering is using a maximum 2' thickness, but increasing the specific heat or density of the material to simulate thicker walls.  Is there a better way?

Thanks,
Jon

Well, the use of the elevators becomes an assumption of energy use.
Recently we had a project where each cubicle had a motion sensor that
controlled the local up-lighting, task lighting, and computer monitors.
A diversity factor was used that accounted for a good bit of this, but
didn't completely include things like bathroom/smoke breaks,
vacation/sick days, or employees attending meetings elsewhere in the
building.  Elevators, like many other factors, are hard to estimate
exact use, and working with a code that acknowledges this for energy use
is currently far more tedious than we'd like to work with.

AAHH, Graham,

I agree, the DESIGN of the building, ie if it has pleasant stairs
(filled with daylight and open, etcc..) and the ORGANIZATION of program
elements are important aspects of a truly sustainable building.  (ps
engineers, talk to your architects on this, get engaged) How to capture
these things in the simulation, however, as you all know can be risky
and if so I would recommend it be well documented to the client you are
doing so.

The only recent building (and subsequent study) on this I know, is on a
new office building for the GSA (our national general services agency)
in LA with more communicating stairs and skipstop elevators.

Subject: Re: [BLDG-SIM] Energy use for elevators

I don't disagree that VT is important.  In fact we find it can  
represent 15% of base building energy use in some buildings.  We also  
find that you can put the exact same generation of lift gear into two  
similar buildings and have lift energy use that is 5 times different  
because it is all dependent on how people move through the building  
and whether the business is internally focussed or externally where  
more people come and go on a daily basis leading to high energy  
use ...  As a result I am sceptical of predictions.

In Australia Green Star, our equivalent of LEED, nominates an energy  
budget for the purposes of energy simulation.  For fairness I would  
have thought Appendix G should nominate a similar budget that should  
only be departed from if there are compelling reasons to do so;  
otherwise, don't you risk creating inequity in ASHRAE 90.1  
comparisons depending on whether the modeller has been optimistic or  
conservative in their lift duty assumptions?

Our head office uses less than half the lift energy use of other  
buildings because we have open communication stairs with a main entry  
at Level 4 so people use the stairs up and down 2-3 floors.  How does  
ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G factor that in?

Well, the use of the elevators becomes an assumption of energy use.
Recently we had a project where each cubicle had a motion sensor that
controlled the local up-lighting, task lighting, and computer monitors.
A diversity factor was used that accounted for a good bit of this, but
didn't completely include things like bathroom/smoke breaks,
vacation/sick days, or employees attending meetings elsewhere in the
building.  Elevators, like many other factors, are hard to estimate
exact use, and working with a code that acknowledges this for energy use
is currently far more tedious than we'd like to work with.

AAHH, Graham,

I agree, the DESIGN of the building, ie if it has pleasant stairs
(filled with daylight and open, etcc..) and the ORGANIZATION of program
elements are important aspects of a truly sustainable building.  (ps
engineers, talk to your architects on this, get engaged) How to capture
these things in the simulation, however, as you all know can be risky
and if so I would recommend it be well documented to the client you are
doing so.

The only recent building (and subsequent study) on this I know, is on a
new office building for the GSA (our national general services agency)
in LA with more communicating stairs and skipstop elevators.

Subject: Re: [BLDG-SIM] Energy use for elevators

I don't disagree that VT is important.  In fact we find it can  
represent 15% of base building energy use in some buildings.  We also  
find that you can put the exact same generation of lift gear into two  
similar buildings and have lift energy use that is 5 times different  
because it is all dependent on how people move through the building  
and whether the business is internally focussed or externally where  
more people come and go on a daily basis leading to high energy  
use ...  As a result I am sceptical of predictions.

In Australia Green Star, our equivalent of LEED, nominates an energy  
budget for the purposes of energy simulation.  For fairness I would  
have thought Appendix G should nominate a similar budget that should  
only be departed from if there are compelling reasons to do so;  
otherwise, don't you risk creating inequity in ASHRAE 90.1  
comparisons depending on whether the modeller has been optimistic or  
conservative in their lift duty assumptions?

Our head office uses less than half the lift energy use of other  
buildings because we have open communication stairs with a main entry  
at Level 4 so people use the stairs up and down 2-3 floors.  How does  
ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G factor that in?

I don't disagree that VT is important.  In fact we find it can  
represent 15% of base building energy use in some buildings.  We also  
find that you can put the exact same generation of lift gear into two  
similar buildings and have lift energy use that is 5 times different  
because it is all dependent on how people move through the building  
and whether the business is internally focussed or externally where  
more people come and go on a daily basis leading to high energy  
use ...  As a result I am sceptical of predictions.

In Australia Green Star, our equivalent of LEED, nominates an energy  
budget for the purposes of energy simulation.  For fairness I would  
have thought Appendix G should nominate a similar budget that should  
only be departed from if there are compelling reasons to do so;  
otherwise, don't you risk creating inequity in ASHRAE 90.1  
comparisons depending on whether the modeller has been optimistic or  
conservative in their lift duty assumptions?

Our head office uses less than half the lift energy use of other  
buildings because we have open communication stairs with a main entry  
at Level 4 so people use the stairs up and down 2-3 floors.  How does  
ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G factor that in?

although, for a truly sustainable building, not all elevators are
created equal, and one should look for those manufacturers that are
making more efficient motors

Question:


What is the relative energy efficiency of various elevator drive
mechanisms? For example, some elevators use "regenerative" motors (when
the carriage goes down, the motor acts as a generator and pumps current
back into the electrical network, producing energy savings). 


Answer:


The following describes various types of elevators.  

Low-rise buildings may use an elevator driven and supported by a
telescoping jack powered by a hydraulic motor. These units operate at a
low, fixed-speed, do not feature regenerative braking, and have a
limited travel or lift of approximately 25-feet. 

For a building with seven or fewer floors, a variation of the hydraulic
elevator may be specified that features a constant speed hydraulic pump
which imparts pressurized hydraulic fluid onto a hydraulic elevator
drive motor. Varying the control valve setting provides the ability to
vary the elevator speed. These hydraulic elevators are equipped with
counterbalances, but do not have regenerative braking. These units are
often found in mid-rise facilities with "residential" usage
characteristics, such as apartments, condominiums, or nursing homes.

High-rise buildings are served by geared or gearless traction elevators.
These elevators are driven by DC MG sets, silicon controlled rectified
(SCR) DC motors, or variable voltage variable frequency (VVVF) drives
coupled to AC motors. All of these configurations provide variable and
high-speed operation and provide regeneration, but exhibit different
operating efficiencies. 

Dover Elevators has calculated the average kWh required per day for a
single elevator equipped with MG, SCR, and VVVF drives (see table
below). Elevators with hydraulic drives would be expected to use about
25% more energy than the SCR drive. The average energy use values are
given for elevators of various capacities, serving from 3 to 32 floors,
and are based upon an 8-hour operating day and an elevator with a
maximum full-load mass of 19,000 pounds. 

Average Energy Consumption (kWh) Per Day

	
Number of 

Floors

	2500 # Capacity

	4000# Capacity

	
VVVF

	SCR 

	MG

	VVVF

	SCR

	MG

	
5

	31

	53

	72

	49

	84

	115

	
10

	92

	151

	
30

	58

	67

	102

	92

	108

	164

	

Note: Average energy consumption values are based on 8 hours of elevator
operation per day. If energy consumption for 10-hour operation is
desired, multiply the numbers in the table by 1.25 

In general, traction elevators, or elevators with regeneration
capability, initially cost twice as much as hydraulic units, and are
typically found in office buildings with heights of 5 stories or
greater.

It does because it makes the percentage energy saved smaller.

Does it really matter that this end use is included if the Base Case
vertical transportation energy use is the same as the Design Case?

		Eric,

		Thanks a lot for your reply.

		I have a further question. If we have the elevator power
data, what appropriate schedule should we use to approximately to get
the elevator annual energy use?

		I checked the ASHREAE Appendix G but cannot find
appropriate schedule for elevators.

	I think the schedule of elevators are quite diffent from other
schedules like occupancy scheule. One example, supposing people work
from 8am to 6pm continuously, I guess that elevator working schedule
should not be the same. Do you have any ideas what appropriate schedule
should we use?

		Thanks a lot.

		Dear All,
		
		I have seen some messages these days asking the energy
use of elevators. But it seems that there is no very accurate way of
modeling annual lift energy use.
		
		If we need to simulate building energy use according to
ASHRAE 90.1-2004 for LEED accrediation in e-QUEST, do we need to
simulate elevator energy use or not? Is it a must do? Could somebody
with experience with this topic give me some hints?

It does because it makes the percentage energy saved smaller.

Try playing with night purge.  I suspect the lower U-Value is  
penalising you by trapping heat at night that is then retained for  
the morning to become an AC load.  If you look at peak loads and have  
simulated using a design day you should see an improvement in peak  
loads by lowering the U-Value.  A thermally massive building would  
make the % change between glasses appear even less.

Hi Anna,

Pitched roofs can be a pain.  If your geometry is complicated, the program
will not be able to calculate the pitched roof geometry.  Simple rectangles,
L-shapes and T-shapes work the best for pitched roofs.  You may be able to
simplify the geometry a little bit and have the program calculate the
pitched roof.

The other way to handle it is to break the building into a couple of shells
and then do the pitched roof.  The program will always locate the main
peak along the longer dimension of a rectangle.  Sometimes you can also
approximate using flat roofs, depending on what info you are after.

If it's a really complicated roof, I usually get as close as I can using the
wizard, and then make edits in detailed edit mode.

One thing I haven't been able to figure out is how to get the wizard to do
knee walls or cathedral ceilings--anyone know?

Hope this helps.

Looking at the 1997 & 2005 ASHRAE Fundamentals chapter on Thermal Comfort (Ch. 8), it appears that the data is based on various studies that have been done ranging from the years 1955 through 1994 (the bibliography is over two pages long for this chapter alone). Table 4, Typical Metabolic Heat Generation for Various Activities lists "Sources: Compiled from various sources. For additional information, see Buskirk (1960), Passmore and Durnin (1967), and Webb (1964)." The bibliography lists those source documents as:

Buskirk, E.R. 1960. Problems related to the caloric cost of living. Bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine 26:365.

Dear all,

I am a PhD Student working on the interdependencies of thermal comfort, user behaviour and architecture.
For my simulations I am looking for measured data for heat loads of persons.
International literature (like ashrae fundamentals) agrees, that in offices in a seated position one average person has about 70W, and I don't know if this value is theoretical or already based on measurements. Does anybody know about any measurements to support or disprove this value?

Thank you in advance and kind regards,

Astrid

Greetings BSUGgers:

We have just posted the handout for Kathy Bash's BSUG 
presentation: "Architecture As a Second Language -- 
Effective collaboration between architects and engineers"  

To retrieve a copy, point your Internet browser to:

http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/BSUG/files/

and download the file under the 070718 - BSUG July 2007
folder.

You might find Kathy's presentation especially interesting.
A few highlights include:

- A graph of six variables showing Napoleon's march to 
Moscow and how the Grand Arm?e  of 500,000 soldiers was 
decimated piecemeal by the Russians and the winter before 
their return.  

- When a pie chart makes sense and a table can be 
invaluable.  

- A new take on the definitions of the standard 
construction phases of programming, SD, DD, and CD 
(reminiscent of Mike Hatten's integrated design language).  

- An overview of simplified design tools, like Google's 
SketchUp, and when they make sense to use.  

- There are three languages in a project: architect-speak, 
engineering-speak, and owner-speak. Owner-speak is the 
language of decision-making.  

- What if designing buildings were top-down instead of 
bottom up? Code is bottom-up: setting minimum threshold 
criteria. But top-down would be to set a standard or target 
for a sustainable design, then see whether you could meet 
or exceed the target.  

How are all these points related? You'll just have to get 
Kathy's presentation to find out.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] OA Loads
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200707251234.AA3450671pd80001460136@gard.com>

Neither 2.1E nor 2.2 reports OA loads separately. What I have done in the past is to make two runs: one with OA, the other with no OA by setting OA to zero or a very small number (be careful about the economizer), then compare the results to get OA loads and other impacts.

EnergyPlus does have an OA report.

Subject: RE:  eQuest Outside Air Load Report


Brandon,
 
I agree that there needs to be better reporting of OA loads in equest.  OA
loads only show up in the system reports so you would have to subtract the
building loads from the load reports to get an approximation of the hourly
OA loads.  Notice I said approximation.  The system reports also include
pipe and duct losses, pump & fan heat and any other system level effects on
your heating/cooling.  The best way I have found to check outside air is to
use the hourly reports.  Remember you can set the hourly report output to a
format that can be easily opened in Excel if you need to do any additional
calculations.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] eQuest Outside Air Load Report


Thanks to all for answers to previous question,
 
Here's one more... I think it has been asked before although I
Google-scanned the archives could not seem to find it.  Namely, where is the
eQuest outside air load reported?  I see lots disclaimers for "The above
loads do not include outside air ventilation loads", but no outside air load
ventilation summary.
 
Do I really have to take a differential between the total load and all other
loads to back-into an outside air load for each space and system? There's
needs to be a better way...!
 
Thanks in advance,

Subject: RE:  Question About Equest - Space Peak Load Calculations

Before equest will use the Design Day information in the schedules you need
to setup actual design days for the simulation to use.

You need to do this in the detailed edit under the Project & Site tab.  You
need to create both a heating and cooling design day and then input the
desired temperature extremes and duration that you wish to simulate.
Reference the climate design data in the ASHRAE Fundamentals Handbook for
your location.  Once you create the design days equest will use them for
equipment sizing rather than the peak heating & cooling loads calculated
from the TMY weather data.

I'll also add that when you simulate a building using a California

the standard reports.  This is a nice feature that seems to only be
incorporated with the CZ climate zones.

Subject: Re:  Gas Fireplace

The tricky thing is the schedule of fireplace use.  Then you need to 
determine how much heat is transferred into the space versus how much 
goes up the chimney.  Then define a process load and schedule.  Set 
the sensible gain appropriately.  In the zone you need to define an 
exhaust fan, fan power and schedule to match the source use schedule.

It is from Table G-1 of the "User's Manual of ASHRAE 90.1 2004".   The
schedule has a different percentage for each business hour. I believe
there have been several discussions on this topic, and you can search in
this mailing list.  Drury Crawley previously recommended a white paper
from ACEEE about the actual energy consumptions of elevator usage.
http://www.aceee.org/buildings/coml_equp/elevators.pdf   If you use
Energyplus, the schedule is already combined in its standard schedule
library. 

Hope this helps.

Dear all,

I am a PhD Student working on the interdependencies of thermal comfort, user
behaviour and architecture.
For my simulations I am looking for measured data for heat loads of persons.
International literature (like ashrae fundamentals) agrees, that in offices in a
seated position one average person has about 70W, and I don't know if this value
is theoretical or already based on measurements. Does anybody know about any
measurements to support or disprove this value?

Thank you in advance and kind regards,

Astrid

David,

Table G-E to G-N in the User Manual for ASHRAE 90.1-2004 provides the default schedules (occupancy, lighting, HVAC, DHW and Elevator) which can be used for Appendix G analysis if the actual schedules are not known.

Moreover, if you are using eQuest then in the detail mode go to daily schedules and right click and select 'create daily schedules' and in the pop-up window click on 'Load Component from Library'. Form the drop down menu in the 'Category' select 'Elevator Schd' and from drop down menu in the 'Entry' select the appropriate schedule. And then go on to make weekly and annual schedules. 
I have not made a comparison, but they might be a bit different from the schedules provided in the User Manual. 

Furthermore, you can assign the elevator power data (in kW) directly to the Electric Meter using the 'Interior Direct Loads' tab and then selecting the elevator schedule from the drop down menu. This enduse can be assigned to Misc Equipment and will show up in addition to the plug loads in the BEPU and BEPS report.

  Eric,

  Thanks a lot for your reply.

  I have a further question. If we have the elevator power data, what appropriate schedule should we use to approximately to get the elevator annual energy use?

  I checked the ASHREAE Appendix G but cannot find appropriate schedule for elevators.
  I think the schedule of elevators are quite diffent from other schedules like occupancy scheule. One example, supposing people work from 8am to 6pm continuously, I guess that elevator working schedule should not be the same. Do you have any ideas what appropriate schedule should we use?

  Thanks a lot.

  David

The tricky thing is the schedule of fireplace use.  Then you need to 
determine how much heat is transferred into the space versus how much 
goes up the chimney.  Then define a process load and schedule.  Set 
the sensible gain appropriately.  In the zone you need to define an 
exhaust fan, fan power and schedule to match the source use schedule.

I'll also add that when you simulate a building using a California
climate zone, it automatically creates a Design Day report along with
the standard reports.  This is a nice feature that seems to only be
incorporated with the CZ climate zones.

Before equest will use the Design Day information in the schedules you
need
to setup actual design days for the simulation to use.

You need to do this in the detailed edit under the Project & Site tab.
You
need to create both a heating and cooling design day and then input the

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Question About Equest - Space Peak Load Calculations

I have a question about how Equest calculates the space peak load
calculation.

For all of my internal heat gains (people, lights, equipment) I have
schedules.  When you create a schedule, it not only asks for utilization
for
Sunday through Saturday, but it also asks for a schedule for Design
Cooling
and schedule for Design Heating.  I assume that the Design Cooling
Schedule/Design Heating Schedule is used by Equest to calculate the peak
cooling and heating load for the space.

For instance, lets say I have a laboratory with 8 watts/square foot of
equipment load.  From an energy standpoint, this equipment load really
never
gets higher than 50% throughout the year.  So I create my Sunday through
Saturday schedules with a peak utilization of 0.5000.  However, there
will
be sometimes where 8 watts/square foot will be generated in the
laboratory,
and I need to size my zone supply airflow for this 8 watts/square foot.
Therefore, I create my design cooling schedule to require a peak
utilization
of 1.000.  However, when I run the simulation and go to the "LS-B Space
Peak
Load Component" report the peak cooling load is using the 50%
diversified
load.  Why is this happening?  Shouldn't Equest be using the Design
Cooling
schedule which has a peak utilization of 1.000 all the time?

Sincerely,

Brandon,
 
I agree that there needs to be better reporting of OA loads in equest.  OA
loads only show up in the system reports so you would have to subtract the
building loads from the load reports to get an approximation of the hourly
OA loads.  Notice I said approximation.  The system reports also include
pipe and duct losses, pump & fan heat and any other system level effects on
your heating/cooling.  The best way I have found to check outside air is to
use the hourly reports.  Remember you can set the hourly report output to a
format that can be easily opened in Excel if you need to do any additional
calculations.

Thanks to all for answers to previous question,
 
Here's one more... I think it has been asked before although I
Google-scanned the archives could not seem to find it.  Namely, where is the
eQuest outside air load reported?  I see lots disclaimers for "The above
loads do not include outside air ventilation loads", but no outside air load
ventilation summary.
 
Do I really have to take a differential between the total load and all other
loads to back-into an outside air load for each space and system? There's
needs to be a better way...!
 
Thanks in advance,

Yes, ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G requires modeling elevator energy as long as it is designed in the project.  You can come up a realistic schedule or stick to a standard schedule in Appendix G if necessary.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] eQuest Outside Air Load Report
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200707231853.AA5354343pd80001458805@gard.com>

Thanks to all for answers to previous question,
 
Here's one more... I think it has been asked before although I
Google-scanned the archives could not seem to find it.  Namely, where is
the eQuest outside air load reported?  I see lots disclaimers for "The
above loads do not include outside air ventilation loads", but no
outside air load ventilation summary.
 
Do I really have to take a differential between the total load and all
other loads to back-into an outside air load for each space and system?
There's needs to be a better way...!
 
Thanks in advance,

Brandon,
 
The first thing that I would do is open up the SIM file and look at the
LS-C report (Building Peak Load Components). This report tells you what
the total building envelope loads and internal heat gains are for peak
cooling and heating conditions. Here are the categories provided:
 
WALL CONDUCTION

ROOF CONDUCTION

WINDOW GLASS+FRM COND

WINDOW GLASS SOLAR

DOOR CONDUCTION

INTERNAL SURFACE COND

UNDERGROUND SURF COND

OCCUPANTS TO SPACE

LIGHT TO SPACE

EQUIPMENT TO SPACE

PROCESS TO SPACE

INFILTRATION 

Since your building appears very insensitive to changes in glazing
U-value my guess is that this report will show that "WINDOW GLASS+FRM
COND" is small compared to the other loads or that one of these other
loads is much larger than the rest. This result may be correct,
especially if the gazing fraction of the facade is low. However, if
"UNDERGROUND SURF COND" is the largest conduction load then you may need
to set U-EFFECTIVE for the slab floors (reasonable values are between
0.01 and 0.02). 
 
You may also find that the building is much more sensitive to changes in
window solar heat gain coefficient than changes in U-value.

All,
 
I have a 3-story historic building, with circa-1920's windows on all
four exposures.  Big, beautiful, clear-glass single-pane architectural
masterpieces.  So while doing an optimization study, it became apparent
to me that substantially changing the U-value and infiltration
coefficients was having very little effect at all on the loads.
 
For example, varying the U-value from 1.27 to 0.55, 0.45 and at last
0.30 in the parametric runs using the 'simplified method' produced a
0.5% total (over all runs) change in the total energy consumption.
Selecting representative glass types using the 'library method' produced
essentially equivalent.  Superimposing upon either of these a change in
the infiltration coefficient from 1/4" to 1/8" to 1/16" to 1/32"
produced no additional effect at all (the INF-METHOD = CRACK keyword is
specified) on the annual energy consumption.
 
Lastly, I changed the baseline glass to "unglazed opening", again with a
mystifying zero net effect on the overall energy consumption.  It's as
if the glass is not being calculated at all, but I see no errors or
warnings in the SIM file.
 
Anyone have an idea on how to debug this?
 
Thanks in advance...

Brandon,
Mysterious. 
 
What's you overall building use (BTU/sf)? Is the glazing are
significant? Where is this building located? (I have done a similar
study in Hawaii where I found that single glazing performs better than
double, because the weather was good for it. 
A good quick gut check  is to look at the LS-F reports and see what
percentage of the loads are coming from window conductance.

Dana
 
I haven't simulated any hospitals under Appendix G, but I have done a
number of pharmaceutical and bio-research labs, which had similar specs
and requirements. 
 
My assumption is that the project intends to seek LEED certification
under LEED-NC 2.2 since you are doing an Appendix G baseline.
 
I also assume that the CUP currently exists and its capacity will not be
expanded to meet the demands of the addition, therefore you will treat
the chilled and hot water from the CUP as purchased cooling and heating
in the proposed design consistent with G3.1.1.1 (this section only
mentions purchased heat, but I think it is reasonable to apply the same
approach to campus chilled water).
 
I would classify the building type as Nonresidential and 3 Floors or
Less & < 75,000 sf, which would require System 3 to be used. Even if you
consider the addition to be part of the larger building, this approach
is still consistent with Section G3.1.1 Exception (a).  
 
I'm not sure why you don't consider this to be a fair comparison since
clearly there is a design decision to be made about connecting the
addition to the existing CUP versus independent cooling and heating
systems.

Hello all,
 
I am currently working on the ASHRAE 90.1-2004, Appendix G baseline
model of a hospital in Oregon. The part of the building being analyzed
is a 40,000 sf, 3 story addition to an already existing building of
approximately 90,000 sf. I am having some issues determining what to use
for the baseline HVAC system. Here are some key details of the current
as-designed building:

*	Reheat fan system 
*	Constant volume, 60,000 cfm 
*	100% outside air 
*	Draws heat from two boilers and two chiller in a central utility
plant that also serves the rest of the building

These design parameters lead to some confusion when selecting the HVAC
baseline systems. For example:

*	Since the addition is served by a system that serves the entire
building, should building be modeled as an ~130,000 sf building? This
would make it System 5 under Table G3.1.1A. Problems with this are that
it calls it out to be a PVAV w/ reheat, which is not a legitimate
comparison. If the baseline is supposed to be PVAV, the OSA requirements
need to be the same anyways (G3.1.2.5), therefore effectively making it
a constant volume system. 
*	Should the sf be taken relative to only the addition (40,000
sf)? This is also not a fair comparison between the two systems because
the addition draws heating and cooling from a system designed for a much
larger square footage. 

I guess my main questions are if anyone has dealt with large, constant
volume, 100% OSA systems and their baseline HVAC systems and if anyone
has modeled additions that are served by a larger CUP.
 
Thanks for any help in advance.

Thanks for all the replies this morning.  I can now read errors (turns out
they are in the simulation output file readable by D2SimViewer--who would've
guessed?).

The error I currently have is: "LOOP: WELL has no attached primary heating
equipment."

Loop Well is a loop type lake/well.  Attached is a chiller of type: loop to
loop heat pump.

Any thoughts?  Thanks for everyone's help.

Robert---

What kind of HVAC system are you specifying?  Clearly whatever it is,
the program is having trouble finding an input for this parameter.  You
can probably fix the error by inputting the value in the 'detailed edit'
mode, if you are familiar yet with that term.  

Save trying to go to a class, I would recommend going through a few of
the eQUEST tutorials that are on the internet as a starting point to
learn some of the basics.  Here are some links...

Basic eQUEST tutorial that covers the basics:

http://www.doe2.com/download/equest/eQUESTv3-40_Tutorial.exe

Here's a pdf of a training workbook that Energy Design Resources put out
in Sept. 2004.  Just a heads up, it's a large file (602 pages) but
there's some good info.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] eQUEST

This is my first post.  I hope it gets through to the list.

I just installed eQUEST and I am trying to evaluate a simple two zone / 
two system single floor (with basement) 1500 sq. ft. building.  I keep 
getting errors asking for input as follows: "Hot Deck Supply Flow 
(HSUPPLY-FLOW) (no default)".  When I go to the input screen, everything

is filled in, and the error will not clear.

If I bypass this error, the results are bad.  It will give a screen with

"---PRELIMINARY DESIGN DOES NOT MEET TITLE 24--- ... Hours outside 
throttling range >10 Percent".  The Title 24 printout has "0" for the 
heating standard design, and basically everything is out of compliance.

I would be happy to buy a book, call an expert, or go to a class on 
eQUEST, but none of that seems to be quickly available.  This list is 
the only resource given, so I am giving it a try.

Any ideas?   Anybody?


Thanks!

I'm assuming you're talking about the '.sim' file that is created by
eQUEST for each model.  It contains the model inputs in a text file that
can be opened with any text editor (Notepad, Crimson Editor, etc.).  The
.sim file can be found in the project directory, with the same name that
you used to save your model.  Good luck.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] loop to loop heat pump

 

Hi all,

I wrote about a week ago how to model a radiant floor system heated by a
heat-pump & ground loop.

I received some answers--thanks! and have set up a test model with a
loop-to-loop heat pump type chiller, lake/well loop and induction coils.
However, when I run the program, it crashes.  I get an error message
stating that details are in a .sin file, but I can't find software to
open or read the file, so I have no idea why the file won't run. 

Any assistance on how to read the .sin file, or changing the file so
that it will run would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Sean, we have found 2 options - one being EnergyPro from Gabel Dodd in
CA - it is CA Title 24 energy code compliance software but can be
manipulated for other regions with some work in DOE2. The other ooption
is Trace 700 (though how they model it is unknown to me - they could not
give me a satisfactory answer when queried.)
 
as an aside, we are currently getting push back from some code officials
regarding refrigerant volume calculations with this system and if they
cannot be resolved by the manufacturer then I would suggest a long hard
look at the viability of this system for certain applications.
 
Peter

Kevin,

Centrifugal chillers have fewer rubbing parts and usually have a
higher airflow than reciprocating chillers.  As a result, they usually
operate at a higher COP than reciprocating chillers do.  For example,
the minimum ASHRAE (90.1-2004) COP for a reciprocating chiller is 4.2
while for a centrifugal chiller it is in the 5.0 - 6.1 range
(depending on the size of your chiller).  You should try running your
model using the higher COP and see if that helps.

Hi Jimmy:

You can use the Equipment Controls and Load Management buttons in the
lower right hand corner of the Controls Tab under Hot Water Loop under
Water Side Tab in eQuest (Detailed Edit Mode). 

You need to put in a annual schedule (as well as week and day schedule)
for the boiler sequence you want, by season. You might for example, say
(for a annual schedule BOILER-SCHED) January thru April is Boiler-Seq-1
Week-Sch), May thru Sept is Boiler-Seq-2 (Week-Sch), and Boiler Seq-1
(Week-Sch)for October thru December. Make Boiler-Seq-1 the same Day-Sch
every day (Mon-Sun+Hol) and the same for Boiler-Seq-2. The Day-Sch for
Boiler-Seq-1 will have a Flag of 1 every hour of the day (if boiler is
to be available every hour), and Boiler-Seq-2 and Flag of 2 for every
hour of the Day-Sch.

The flag is input in the day schedule. The Day-Sch with Flag = 2 will
have ONLY your summer boiler scheduled. The day-Sch with Flag = 1 will
have only your winter boiler scheduled.  The equipment annual schedule
will be input in the Qualification Schedule entry on the General Tab of
the Load management inputs.

Hope this isn't too confusing. All BLDG-SIM members, make sure I said
this correctly.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200707181651.AA5148703pd80001456280@gard.com>

Karen,
I just modeled a similar system in eQuest.  The central loop to loop heat
pump worked out pretty well for me.  You have to set up the model (with all
the necessary loops and pumps) in the detailed mode in eQuest.  I ran into a
few quirks....I've been meaning to send them on to Jeff, but I'll just post
them here instead.  They are only interface issues.


   - When creating a second HP type chiller by copying my first one, it
   asks me to create a new pump.  After I create that pump it never lets
   me out of the 'Required Chiller Data' dialogue box.  I ended up having
   to close eQuest with the task manager and couldn't save my file.


   - When creating a HP chiller from scratch, eQuest asks for a CHW loop,
   HW loop, and CW loop.  The CW loop must be a lake/well loop but that
   isn't one of the options you're given to create.  It's possible to get
   through this issue without things crashing, but it involved randomly
   clicking on cancel a half-dozen times.


   - When I try to change the pump 'motor class' and 'capacity control'
   in the spreadsheet tab, I get errors.

The other thing that it sounds like you'll run into is that you can't put a
boiler on the same loop as your heat pump.  I had to create a separate HW
loop to model back-up energy use from a boiler for the building I was
modeling.  I modeled the radiant system as induction units with fan power
set to zero.

Good luck,
Aleka


Hi All,

I have a question regarding eQuest:

I'm modeling a house that will use a ground source heat pump with boiler
backup as a heat source.  The heat pumps will heat water that is circulated
through radiant tubing in the floor.  Is a loop-to-loop heat pump a good way
to model this?  I've done some research on it, but am not sure whether this
can be modeled in eQuest either in the wizards or parametric runs without
changing the BDL file directly.

How are my options for modeling cooling systems limited with the heating
system described above?

Any help is appreciated.

Thank You,

~Karen~

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] What does ADJUST-LOADS adjust?
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200707181306.AA0618703pd80001456077@gard.com>

All;

I should have known this already, but Jeff Hirsch clarified that DOE-2
users may need to adjust (carefully) the relative
COOLING/HEATING-DESIGN-Ts in buffer zones if auto-sizing airflows. I
USUALLY find the default minimum design airflows and safety factors
result in adequate airflows in the conditioned zones. However:

 

--- 
Jeff Hirsch responded:

Relative to the dT used for the interior wall heat transfer ... 

  

The hourly simulated heat transfer across an interior wall is based on
the hourly 

simulated temperatures on either side of the wall.  The design
calculation heat transfer 

across an interior wall is governed ONLY be the design temperatures of
the zones on 

either side of the wall. 

  

The "adjust loads" feature controls if the peak load arising from the
hourly fixed temperature

load calculation for each SPACE is "adjusted" during the HVAC sizing
calculation based

upon the specified heat/cool design temperatures for the ZONE that
represents that SPACE

for the HVAC simulation. 

  

The unconditioned and plenum design temperatures can start as a "guess"
and then be 

adjusted based upon simulation values.  There is no automated "capture"
of design day 

unconditioned/plenum zone temperatures at the time of each connected
conditioned 

zone peak load to feed into the calculation.  This is not unique to
DOE-2/eQUEST, but 

we are adding a better method to handle this and other sizing issues
automatically in 

the next version of DOE-2 (expected next year) 

  

From JJH's response above, if the design temperatures are the same for a
"plenum" and the space below, there will be no heat transfer during the
sizing calculation; that's why changing "plenum" roof characteristics
did not change design airflow in the conditioned space below the
ceiling.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] What does ADJUST-LOADS adjust?

 

All;
When simulating (eQ v3-61, DOE-2.2 v44e4) a building with a "plenum"
(unconditioned or plenum), and changing the roof absorptance greatly,
the auto-sized design air flow does NOT seem to change in the zone
below, even though the ZONE SIZING-OPTION = ADJUST-LOADS. After
observing this in a big model, I tested this in a simple single zone
model (eQ Wiz). I made sure airflow sizing was driven by cooling loads,
and created a parametric run that changed the ABSORPTANCE of the roof
construction between 90% and 10%. Hourly cooling loads vary as expected,
but design airflow remains the same between both models. 

Raising the DESIGN-COOL-T (from the default 75F, same for all zones) in
the "plenum" increases the design airflow in the zone below (for both
absorptances), but I thought ADJUST-LOADS did more than just recognize
this input. The problem seems to persist whether I have a cooling design
day or not, and whatever I do with the LOADS SPACE "TEMPERATUREs" and
ZONE DESIGN-COOL-Ts. 

Any insights out there? Anyone else notice this behavior? Is this a bug,
or did I expect too much of the program? Unless the DESIGN-COOL-T is
raised (to a value one must estimate or find by inspection of hourly
reports), it appears the program under-sizes airflow to zones where a
significant fraction of the heat gain is through a ceiling
cavity/plenum/attic, or I suppose any "un-conditioned" buffer space.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] eQUEST warning messages: HSUPPLY, DHW Loop Pump, CURINV
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200707171125.AA2549203pd80001455497@gard.com>

I am modeling a building in eQUEST with the following HVAC system types:
PTAC, UVT, MZS, PMZS.  The building is situated in New York City, where code
ventilation requirements for the baseline model require exhaust rates
roughly triple ASHRAE 62 guidelines (those requirements will be changing
shortly).  It is a 15 story multifamily building comprised of 5 shells due
to different floor shapes and zoning patterns.  I am having difficulty
understanding three of the warning messages and thought I would see if other
have experienced/solved these problems before.  Thanks in advance!

1)  I am pretty sure this warning message pertains to the MZS or PMZS
because they are the only two air-side systems with HSUPPLY specified in the
INP file.

**WARNING**********************************************************************

             User-specified HSUPPLY-CFM is larger than
             available return air.  Heating capacity may
             be inadequate.
I checked the BEPS report and it shows that
"PERCENT OF HOURS ANY SYSTEM ZONE OUTSIDE OF THROTTLING RANGE = 86.0
PERCENT OF HOURS ANY PLANT LOAD NOT SATISFIED                =  0.0"

2)  I tried increasing the "Pump Head" under "Domestic Water
Heater/Attachments" in the DDI from the default of 1 to several other
values, but the warning message always spits back a number that is 5 ft
greater than whatever I enter under "Pump Head".  E.g., I enter Pump Head =
100, it spits back a loop head of 105 in the warning message.
 **WARNING**********************************************************************
             Pump: DHW Loop Pump                    has a user-specified
head
             of         1. feet, but the loop head is       6. feet.

3)  Per a recommendation from Mike Tillou on the BLDG-SIM archive, I tried
changing all curves in the model to "default", but that did not remove the
following error message (which repeats for literally hundreds of pages).
CURINV: No real root for CURVE:
 1  1.353483  0.015932 -0.369414  0.000000  0.000000  0.000000
CURINV: No real root for CURVE:
 1  1.353483  0.015932 -0.369414  0.000000  0.000000  0.000000
CURINV: No real root for CURVE:
 1  1.353483  0.015932 -0.369414  0.000000  0.000000  0.000000


(Background):
Even though I think I've figured out the source of this warning message, I
thought I'd include it in case it's relevant to understanding the warning
messages above.

This warning is coming from the exhaust rates being specified higher than
outdoor air intake rates.
**WARNING**********************************************************************
             ZONE EL1 ESE Perim Zn ( G.ESE1)        in SYSTEM EL1 Sys1
(PTAC) (G.ESE1)
             has unused EXHAUST-CFM specified.
             This has been converted to outside air.

Thank you so much!  Looking forward to hearing back from those with
thoughts/insights/experiences on this.

Best,
Andy

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200707170427.AA2753343pd80001455246@gard.com>

Dear All,

 

Recently I requested help (and got it, thank you very much) with regard to the heating and cooling demand of a 20 sqm zone representing a room in a building with one fa?ade fully glazed and a fan coil unit specified. After consideration it was concluded that the heating demand calculated with eQuest was reasonable however the cooling demand was very very small. The chiller chosen was an electric-hermetic-reciprocating chiller (at random because I didn't know any better) with an EIR of 0.25 (COP=4.0) and after a long time investigating I changed the chiller to a electric-hermetic-centrifugal chiller and kept the EIR at 0.25. This resulted in the cooling load quadrupling! Does anybody know why this should be the case when every other parameter remained the same?

 

Kevin Burke

If return air is via plenum then the volume connected to the return  
air is the same.  My guess is that EQuest/2.2 does not try to do a  
CO2 balance and is thus working off occupant density and outdoor air  
(probably from mechanical systems only) so volume may be  
inconsequential.  For large spaces with transient occupancy this  
could be inaccurate - codes in Australia allow us to take advantage  
of this large volume of unvitiated air for theatre foyers etc.  If  
EQuest/2.2 did do a transient CO2 balance then the inaccurracies of  
modelling with no plenum would be limited to transient conditions  
which for offices would be morning, evening and lunch.  In this case  
I gues your simulation would be slightly optimistic.  I assume Steve  
Gates / Jeff Hirsch can clarify anything that isn't stated in the 2.2  
Dictionary.

Graham

Use cut nails 10p. I've never seen moisture problems with blue board but

Lynn:
 
My interpretation of the NEW FEATURES section in DOE-2.2 explanation of
DCV is that it responds to the outside air requirement. The User decides
whether that is base on outside air per person or per square foot. So I
believe outside air has to be established on a CFM/person basis. The OSA
would not have any tie between to people if it was stated on a CFM/sf
basis.

Thanks to everyone who responded to the threads that came from the
original question. With respect to the note immediately below, how is
the demand for outside air determined when DCV is modeled in eQuest? I
was assuming the inputs would be the number of occupants (and their
activity levels) and the volume of the space. If deleted plenum volumes
are re-assigned to occupied spaces, the CO2 concentration (and
presumably OA fraction) should clearly be reduced in a real-life DCV
situation. Does the eQuest model of DCV take this into account or is it
more simplified?

John, that is a good point if your program is modeling the CO2
concentration explicitly.

 

If you (or simulation program) are using the scheduled quantity of
people as the surrogate for CO2 measurements then it would be the same
amount of OA with or without plenums.

 

(How ironic is that?  Using number of people in the model as the
surrogate for CO2 measurements...which in the real building is the
surrogate for the number of people...)

The plenums subtract from the total room volume.  If the return is
ducted, this makes a large difference.  Also while the plenum & room may
have the same or nearly the same temp/humidity, ventilation rates for
the room might be calculated based on a CO2 level difference.  The CO2
calculation is based on the room volume, which relates directly with OA
needed, and hence the energy to condition that OA.  The plenum can mean
a big difference in room volume flows when extrapolated across an entire
building.

Valid concerns, to be sure.  But are there not simpler ways to account
for the additional air and energy than carrying the additional
'overhead' (no pun intended) of plenums in a simulation?  And wouldn't
additional outside air tend to 'err' (no homophone intended) on the side
of conservancy when projecting energy consumption?  Lastly, when doing
comparative analyses, wouldn't the additional air (and energy) for the
plenums tend to 'cancel out'?
 
Am not suggesting omitting plenums for final, dialed-in load
calculations.  But for schematic design or design development-level
comparative energy analyses, dropping the plenums can save the analyst
significant speculative busy-work when extrapolated across a large
building.  
 
Just our methodology for the above types of projects, FWIW.

Lynn,

 

Do you really need the plenums?  Personally I find them non-value-added
for most of our energy study work.  Suggest specifying ceiling height
equal to floor-to-floor height in the DD wizard to make them disappear.

I am using eQuest to model an office building with 3 unique floors, many
spaces (with diff't use types) per floor and plenums between floors. I
have already defined the appropriate footprints for each floor and
imported them into a single model. NBD. Because there are many spaces
per floor and plenums assume the shape of the space they sit over, it
seemed like a good idea to import the plenums as separate, floor-shaped
spaces. This was to allow internal floors and ceilings of the non-plenum
spaces to be specified as NEXT-TO the appropriate plenum without any
concern for the shape of the plenum. If each space on, say, Floor1 had
an associated plenum reflecting the space shape, the spaces on Floor2
would not line up with those plenums. I defined neither a floor or
ceiling for the plenums so that interior floors and ceilings would be
part of the occupied spaces. As I'm sure many of you are thinking, DOE2
doesn't like that arrangement and requires at least two TILTs among the
interior surfaces, i.e. walls + floor, walls + ceiling or floor +
ceiling. If I put a floor in the 1st-floor plenum, I need to specify
which space it is NEXT-TO and the approach falls apart. Obviously, the
same deal applies to plenum ceilings. Has anyone got any ideas of how to
work around this? Is it better to just associate the plenums with the
spaces below them and let the chips fall where they may when the
separate floors are imported (i.e. can heat transfer from/to plenums be
ignored?)? Am I missing something really obvious?

 

Thanks in advance.

Hi Aleka,
 
A different sort of question comes to mind.  Once heated to 180F, what is
the fluid return temperature?  If above 110F it seems like it will heat the
geothermal loop from the boiler.  Another possibility is to select the
fan-coils units to work using the 110F supply.  Otherwise, the
fan-coil/boiler loop may need to be completely separate.
 
Good luck,
 
Michael Haughey

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] central heat pumps and circulation loops


Hi all,
I'm trying to model a central ground water source heat pump serving hot &
cold water loops for a radiant heating & cooling system in eQuest.  The 110
F hot water loop from the heat pump (loop to loop HP type chiller) serves
the radiant system directly, and has a secondary loop with a boiler attached
to it to bring the temperature up from 110 F to 180 F to serve some fan coil
units.  
I'm having a hard time configuring the loops and plant equipment to even
approximate this system.  Has anyone tried to model something like this in
eQuest?  From what I understanding, you can't put a boiler on a secondary
loop, and I'm hitting a wall with that.  If I put the boiler and the HP on
the same primary loop, I get errors that tell me 180 F is too high a
temperature for a GSHP water loop.  The closest I seem to be able to get is
to model the system with two separate HW loops - one for the fan coils with
only a boiler and one for the radiant system with the HP.  But, then I can't
use the heat pump to preheat for the FCU loop with this model.  

Any thoughts?

Thanks,
Aleka

The way it is written (and the way we've been instructed to review it as
USGBC LEED reviewers), you are permitted to apply any of the addenda to
your project.  However, for each addendum you choose to apply, the
entire addendum applies, and it applies to any other relevant LEED
points.  Paul's example is correct: since both the 25,000 square foot
threshold and the normalized glazing revision are included as part of
addendum a, you would have to follow both of these requirements if you
choose to apply that addendum to the project.  However, you are not
required to apply other addenda to the project just because you chose to
follow addendum a.

Paul,

My interpretation of the USGBC ruling is the same as yours, I think.
You 
cannot pick and choose which items in ASHRAE addenda to use on your LEED
project.  You have to choose either 90.1-2004 with no addenda or
90.1-2004
with addenda which would include ALL the published adddenda that apply
to 
ALL chapters of 90.1-2004 not just Appendix G.  There are currently 42
addenda to ASHRAE 90.1-2004 (a-v,x,y,aa-ae,ag-ar,av...I hope I didn't
miss
any) This decision would also impact your compliance with the EA energy 
performance pre-requisite.

As you said "messy".

I think that all the 90.1-2004 addenda will eventually be published as
ASHRAE 90.1-2007 which will simplify keeping track of all the changes.

Has anyone read the fine print referenced in these strings to reach this
conclusion:

If you are modeling under 90.1-2004 Appendix G for LEED and opt to not 
normalize the glazing by orientation under addendum a, then you must
also
except the other portions of addendum a, most notably the revised area
threshold of 25,000 sf for the base HVAC system in Table G3.1.1A.

It seems like a messy and perhaps unintentional convergence of standard
and
policy adoption but it also seems like it is there in black and white.
Any
other conclusions?

The requirement to  distribute fenestration uniformly in horizontal

published Addenda Supplement to 90.1, 2004. See the ASHRAE website for
the

Appendix G notes that for the Baseline building: "Vertical fenestration
areas for new buildings and additions shall equal that in the proposed
design or 40% of gross above grade wall area, whichever is smaller, and 
shall be distributed uniformly in horizontal bands across the four
orientations."
Does this mean that the Baseline building gets windows on all walls on
each
orientation whether or not the Design case has a window in all walls on
each 
orientation.  For example, if the west orientation has 30% glazing
overall
but many spaces have no windows - some walls on the west face have more
that
30%.  Do those spaces in the Baseline case get 30% glazing?  Or do I
only 
put windows in the Baseline case where there are windows in the Design
case.

Thanks for any help!

Thanks Gail very much for the notification,

process.  Seems like just a month ago I was railing on about this very
topic; now I'm out of excuses for not drafting up an ASHRAE 90.1

Decision impacting EAc1 Credit )


Dear Fellow Energy modelers,

The following posting has been placed on the USGBC website (
http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=2664 ), which allows the
use of
ASHRAE Addenda for all credits referencing ASHRAE standards.


Use of approved Addenda for ASHRAE Standards referenced in LEED

Background:
ASHRAE currently publishes Continuous Maintenance standards every three 
years, with a Supplement published eighteen months after the Standard is
published. In rare cases, addenda are published in between the
eighteen-month periods. LEED development and ASHRAE standards
development
are not aligned and many addenda have been approved that would be useful
for
LEED project teams.

Action:
LEED project teams are required to use the ASHRAE Standard referenced in
the
applicable Reference Guide and are permitted to use addenda within the
most 
recent Supplement to that Standard, as well as any approved addenda
published in between the eighteen-month periods. Project teams are
responsible for notifying LEED reviewers of the use of ASHRAE addenda
utilized at the time of project documentation submission. 
If a project team elects to use an addendum to an ASHRAE Standard, this
addendum must be applied to the entire LEED submittal.
This should make fenestration modeling much easier for the Baseline Case
for
projects opting to follow the Addendum.

Lynn,
 
Do you really need the plenums?  Personally I find them non-value-added
for most of our energy study work.  Suggest specifying ceiling height
equal to floor-to-floor height in the DD wizard to make them disappear.

I am using eQuest to model an office building with 3 unique floors, many
spaces (with diff't use types) per floor and plenums between floors. I
have already defined the appropriate footprints for each floor and
imported them into a single model. NBD. Because there are many spaces
per floor and plenums assume the shape of the space they sit over, it
seemed like a good idea to import the plenums as separate, floor-shaped
spaces. This was to allow internal floors and ceilings of the non-plenum
spaces to be specified as NEXT-TO the appropriate plenum without any
concern for the shape of the plenum. If each space on, say, Floor1 had
an associated plenum reflecting the space shape, the spaces on Floor2
would not line up with those plenums. I defined neither a floor or
ceiling for the plenums so that interior floors and ceilings would be
part of the occupied spaces. As I'm sure many of you are thinking, DOE2
doesn't like that arrangement and requires at least two TILTs among the
interior surfaces, i.e. walls + floor, walls + ceiling or floor +
ceiling. If I put a floor in the 1st-floor plenum, I need to specify
which space it is NEXT-TO and the approach falls apart. Obviously, the
same deal applies to plenum ceilings. Has anyone got any ideas of how to
work around this? Is it better to just associate the plenums with the
spaces below them and let the chips fall where they may when the
separate floors are imported (i.e. can heat transfer from/to plenums be
ignored?)? Am I missing something really obvious?

Paul,

My interpretation of the USGBC ruling is the same as yours, I think.  You
cannot pick and choose which items in ASHRAE addenda to use on your LEED
project.  You have to choose either 90.1-2004 with no addenda or 90.1-2004
with addenda which would include ALL the published adddenda that apply to
ALL chapters of 90.1-2004 not just Appendix G.  There are currently 42
addenda to ASHRAE 90.1-2004 (a-v,x,y,aa-ae,ag-ar,av...I hope I didn't miss
any) This decision would also impact your compliance with the EA energy
performance pre-requisite. 

As you said "messy".

I think that all the 90.1-2004 addenda will eventually be published as
ASHRAE 90.1-2007 which will simplify keeping track of all the changes.  

Regards,

Mike

Has anyone read the fine print referenced in these strings to reach this
conclusion:

If you are modeling under 90.1-2004 Appendix G for LEED and opt to not
normalize the glazing by orientation under addendum a, then you must also
except the other portions of addendum a, most notably the revised area
threshold of 25,000 sf for the base HVAC system in Table G3.1.1A.

It seems like a messy and perhaps unintentional convergence of standard and
policy adoption but it also seems like it is there in black and white.  Any
other conclusions?

Appendix G notes that for the Baseline building: "Vertical fenestration
areas for new buildings and additions shall equal that in the proposed
design or 40% of gross above grade wall area, whichever is smaller, and
shall be distributed uniformly in horizontal bands across the four
orientations."
Does this mean that the Baseline building gets windows on all walls on each
orientation whether or not the Design case has a window in all walls on each
orientation.  For example, if the west orientation has 30% glazing overall
but many spaces have no windows - some walls on the west face have more that
30%.  Do those spaces in the Baseline case get 30% glazing?  Or do I only
put windows in the Baseline case where there are windows in the Design case.

Thanks for any help!

Dear Fellow Energy modelers,

The following posting has been placed on the USGBC website (
http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=2664), which allows the use of
ASHRAE Addenda for all credits referencing ASHRAE standards.


Use of approved Addenda for ASHRAE Standards referenced in LEED

Background:
ASHRAE currently publishes Continuous Maintenance standards every three
years, with a Supplement published eighteen months after the Standard is
published. In rare cases, addenda are published in between the
eighteen-month periods. LEED development and ASHRAE standards development
are not aligned and many addenda have been approved that would be useful for
LEED project teams.

Action:
LEED project teams are required to use the ASHRAE Standard referenced in the
applicable Reference Guide and are permitted to use addenda within the most
recent Supplement to that Standard, as well as any approved addenda
published in between the eighteen-month periods. Project teams are
responsible for notifying LEED reviewers of the use of ASHRAE addenda
utilized at the time of project documentation submission.
If a project team elects to use an addendum to an ASHRAE Standard, this
addendum must be applied to the entire LEED submittal.
This should make fenestration modeling much easier for the Baseline Case for
projects opting to follow the Addendum.




Best Regards,

Gail Stranske

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] central heat pumps and circulation loops
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200707121202.AA0259828pd80001452992@gard.com>

Hi all,
I'm trying to model a central ground water source heat pump serving hot &
cold water loops for a radiant heating & cooling system in eQuest.  The 110
F hot water loop from the heat pump (loop to loop HP type chiller) serves
the radiant system directly, and has a secondary loop with a boiler attached
to it to bring the temperature up from 110 F to 180 F to serve some fan coil
units.
I'm having a hard time configuring the loops and plant equipment to even
approximate this system.  Has anyone tried to model something like this in
eQuest?  From what I understanding, you can't put a boiler on a secondary
loop, and I'm hitting a wall with that.  If I put the boiler and the HP on
the same primary loop, I get errors that tell me 180 F is too high a
temperature for a GSHP water loop.  The closest I seem to be able to get is
to model the system with two separate HW loops - one for the fan coils with
only a boiler and one for the radiant system with the HP.  But, then I can't
use the heat pump to preheat for the FCU loop with this model.

Any thoughts?

Thanks,
Aleka

FYI

ASHRAE has developed a toolkit for calculating loadshapes from 8760 data, RP1093. You can get a copy of the toolkit by contacting Mike Vaughn at ASHRAE. The toolkit uses an interquartile analysis to calc the load shapes and also produces a snippet of DOE-2, BLAST and EP code with the coded loadshape. The final report and 2 papers also have a literature search that contains refs to other studies.

All, 

 

We are trying to verify if its possible to smooth out 8760 load shape in eQUEST to represent the a wider population versus a single building. DOE2 is this an option (I believe), but it is still possible in eQUEST. Our issue is this, when generating 8760 load shape profile, the output file produces a load shape that reflects the load shape associated with a single structure. However, what we want would be a load shape that captures the variability in the operating schedules associated with buildings in the population.  We would be very interested to know how and if this is possible to smooth the load shape generated in eQUEST.  Thank you,

Has anyone read the fine print referenced in these strings to reach this
conclusion:

If you are modeling under 90.1-2004 Appendix G for LEED and opt to not
normalize the glazing by orientation under addendum a, then you must
also except the other portions of addendum a, most notably the revised
area threshold of 25,000 sf for the base HVAC system in Table G3.1.1A.

It seems like a messy and perhaps unintentional convergence of standard
and policy adoption but it also seems like it is there in black and
white.  Any other conclusions?

Thanks,

The requirement to  distribute fenestration uniformly in horizontal
bands across the four orientations has been removed from Appendix G in
the published Addenda Supplement to 90.1, 2004. See the ASHRAE website
for the supplement.

Appendix G notes that for the Baseline building: "Vertical fenestration
areas for new buildings and additions shall equal that in the proposed
design or 40% of gross above grade wall area, whichever is smaller, and
shall be distributed uniformly in horizontal bands across the four
orientations."
Does this mean that the Baseline building gets windows on all walls on
each orientation whether or not the Design case has a window in all
walls on each orientation.  For example, if the west orientation has 30%
glazing overall but many spaces have no windows - some walls on the west
face have more that 30%.  Do those spaces in the Baseline case get 30%
glazing?  Or do I only put windows in the Baseline case where there are
windows in the Design case.

Thanks for any help!

Thanks Gail very much for the notification,

And thanks to whomever was responsible for convincing USGBC to amend the
process.  Seems like just a month ago I was railing on about this very
topic; now I'm out of excuses for not drafting up an ASHRAE 90.1
Appendix G amendment to address shortcomings in the baseline building
rotation exercise.

Dear Fellow Energy modelers,

The following posting has been placed on the USGBC website (
http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=2664), which allows the
use of ASHRAE Addenda for all credits referencing ASHRAE standards.


Use of approved Addenda for ASHRAE Standards referenced in LEED

Background:
ASHRAE currently publishes Continuous Maintenance standards every three
years,
with a Supplement published eighteen months after the Standard is
published. In rare
cases, addenda are published in between the eighteen-month periods. LEED
development and ASHRAE standards development are not aligned and many
addenda
have been approved that would be useful for LEED project teams.

Action:
LEED project teams are required to use the ASHRAE Standard referenced in
the
applicable Reference Guide and are permitted to use addenda within the
most recent
Supplement to that Standard, as well as any approved addenda published
in between the
eighteen-month periods. Project teams are responsible for notifying LEED
reviewers of
the use of ASHRAE addenda utilized at the time of project documentation
submission.
If a project team elects to use an addendum to an ASHRAE Standard, this
addendum
must be applied to the entire LEED submittal.
This should make fenestration modeling much easier for the Baseline Case
for projects opting to follow the Addendum.




Best Regards,

Gail Stranske

I would have thought the 300 of 8,760 would be on a zone by zone  
basis and then system by system basis so number of zones shouldn't  
impact it.  But I practice in Australia and I haven't looked through  
90.1 since the 1989 revision when I was in Canada ... so just an  
opinion.

Also the SS-R report is very useful, particularly for VAV systems.   
It will show you how the zone air volumes are distributed as a % of  
design and reports loads under-cooled and under-heated by zone.   
However a few years back I came across a lot of hours under-heated or  
under-cooled and couldn't work out why.  Turns out it includes any  
hours the fans run which could be for night purge when setpoints are  
not being held.  To my knowledge this hasn't been changed.  I am  
unsure whether loads not met works the same way (i.e. includes night  
purge hours) ...

FYI...

 

This would be really tricky...in EQUEST, as in DOE-2, one would need to
make sure the CWFs are turned on, and all walls, roofs, etc. are
layered. In addition, one would need proper framing-factors for the
walls, and if the building is slab on grade, effective u-values
following Winklemann's method. One would need to look at the BDL to
ascertain this.

 

Then comes the fun part...since a simulation like DOE-2 or EQUEST might
not really be simulating what is going on, one need to have "effective
parameters" for the coupling of the thermal mass to the interior node,
etc. 

 

For example, see the paper by Janet Manke and Doug Hittle in the 1985
ASME Conference proceedings that used "effective" parameters to best
represent the thermal mass, convection and radiation exchange within a
building. There are other papers that have addressed this issue using
TRNSYS by Jim Braun, et al. in the ASHRAE literature. I believe there
was also an ASHRAE Research Project on this as well.

 

Beware....

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Modeling Thermal Mass in eQUEST

 

All,

 

We're trying to model thermal mass effects on load shifting for a
non-residential building for the Savings By Design program.

 

Title-24 references tables for thermal mass savings for low-rise
residential depending on the constructions present.  From my
understanding, EnergyPro follows the ways of the T-24 energy code, and
really doesn't model thermal mass for what it is.  

 

I know eQUEST requires the "Layers Input" for the program to assign a
mass to the construction (and not the "U-Value Input").  

 

Does eQUEST also reference tables (similar to the T-24 energy code), or
are there some genuine calculations made?

 

Thanks again,

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200707101631.AA311178pd80001451995@gard.com>

All, 

 

We are trying to verify if its possible to smooth out 8760 load shape in
eQUEST to represent the a wider population versus a single building.
DOE2 is this an option (I believe), but it is still possible in eQUEST.
Our issue is this, when generating 8760 load shape profile, the output
file produces a load shape that reflects the load shape associated with
a single structure. However, what we want would be a load shape that
captures the variability in the operating schedules associated with
buildings in the population.  We would be very interested to know how
and if this is possible to smooth the load shape generated in eQUEST.
Thank you,

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] thermal breaks for metal studs inside concrete walls

Greetings BLDG-SIMmers,
 
Has anyone run across an explanation/quantification of how an effective thermal break might be provided for metal studs installed for furring on the inside of existing concrete walls? 
 
An architect's detail from outside to inside, shows an existing 8" concrete walls abutted against a 3-5/8" metal studs with furring installed 24" o/c with batt insulation, and gyp board for the finished side. The overall U-value is certainly a lot better than the bare concrete, but it would be improved if the metal studs weren't in direct contact with the concrete. 
 
Any thoughts on how to quantify this arrangements?

In DOE2.1E and in DOE2.2/eQuest, you can view the number of unmet loads
hours on a zone-by-zone basis in the SS-F report. This reports the
number of hours that the zone loads were not met broken down by month
and by category (i.e. heating or cooling).

In addition, the BEPU report gives you the total of unmet loads hours as
a percentage for the system simulation and the central plant simulation.
Be aware that the system unmet loads fraction can be misleading as it is
the number of zone loads not met by the system summed over all the
zones. Therefore, if one zone has unmet loads for 8760 hours then the
fraction will be reported as 100% even if all the other zones have zero
unmet loads. 

With regard to the loads not met by the plant in the BEPU report, if
these occur at the same time as an unmet system load there will be
double counting of loads not met by the simulation.

My own view is that the Appendix G definition of unmet loads unfairly
penalises simulations with large numbers of zones. For example, in a 10
zone simulation, each zone would need to have 30 hours with unmet loads
to reach the 300 hour limit. But in a simulation with 100 zones each
zone would only need 3 hours of unmet loads to reach 300 unmet loads
hours. 

If I were to rewrite the relevant section of Appendix G to correct this
problem I would multiply the number of hours of unmet load for each zone
by that zone's fraction of building floor area. This would normalise the
measurement of unmet loads to the size of the building and the number of
zones in the simulation so that the maximum possible percentage of unmet
loads would be 100%.

You can click on the building level in the left-hand panel explorer when
you are in the air-side module of eQuest, and then go to the summary
tab.  It will summarize the zones and systems that have unmet loads.

(If you have selected a particular air system in the explorer you will
get the summary for only that system rather than all of the systems.)

I haven't experimented enough to know how it calculates the "building
total" unmet hours...if simultaneous unmet zones/systems count double or
not.  It does provide an overall project system unmet hours for you to
use.

The temperature and humidity reports are also useful in the full output
-- in the sim viewer program you can scroll through the zones with the
down arrow once you've selected the desired report to spot any irregular
temperatures.  This might be hard to spot that one spurious hour, but it
will help you see if you are getting a lot of unmet hours at a time you
thought the system was supposed to off for example, or if the unmet
hours are at start-up.  Or perhaps there is a zone that has high
temperatures in winter due to a west facing window and the cooling is
off.

Last idea, make sure you have consistent zone setpoint schedules and
zone design heating and cooling temperatures.  Maybe you have changed
the setpoint schedules during the project and not gone back to the
design setpoint to make the corresponding change.

 Hello,

 

I have been trying to model water-to-water gshp in a heating only
residential building, supplemented with a boiler and feeds into baseboard
heating and a rooftop make up air unit for air-side.  The system has heat
recovery and there is no cooling.

 

Thus far I have only been able to connect a lake/well ground source heat
exchanger to a chiller via cold water loop.  I have the chiller equipment
capacity at zero to resemble no cooling.  The airside rooftop unit I am
using is of type packaged single zone and has the hot water loop connected
to the heating coil and baseboard.

 

I have confirmed with a colleague who is also modeling water-to-water heat
pumps from a ground source heat exchanger that this would be the way to do
it.

 

Would psz be appropriate for the airside system type, the only compliable
choices or PVAV PVVT and PSZ and this is not a variable volume?

 

Please let me know if I need to clarify anything further.  I would
appreciate hearing any insight on this situation and modeling water-to-water
gshp. Thank you.

 

 

Kevin

Kristin:

Thanks for your reply. I will forward your response to the list.

If the standards only address sensible load, I'm wondering whether the Unmet Load Hours is sufficient to evaluate the performance of a HVAC system, especially in humid climate where indoor humidity control is an essential part of the HVAC system. Since indoor humidity control may consume significant energy depending on the equipment/system used, I think the unmet latent load or the indoor humidity level should also be accounted for in the building energy performance evaluation to get fair comparison between proposed and baseline building designs.

Xiaobing,

I tried to send this email to the list, but there's a
glitch that doesn't allow my messages to get through. 
Anyway, here's my response for you at least:

My interpretation is that the standard is addressing
sensible load only and that it is for building-wide
hours of load unmet, not by zone.  Anyone disagree?

For eQUEST/DOE-2.2, this would mean that I'd say to
use the number on the BEPS report instead of from the
SS-R reports (although those are very helpful to look
at for other reasons).

Elliot:
 
Simple as pie.
 
The Design Development Wizard (DD Wizard) allows one to draw different
shell (floors, if you will) shapes, which can be either separate
buildings or separate floors. You can also import AutoCAD .DWG files to
trace each floor from.
 
I believe eQuest Tutorial Item Tab 3 (Example: 7th and Lane) outlines a
bit of how to approach the DD Wizard route.
 
Any building I have now usually starts in the Schematic design Wizard,
then goes to the DD Wizard to traces the floors and/or multiple
buildings. Once I have the building "cookie cuttered" out, I dive
straight to the Detailed Interface to finalize my inputs.
 
You'll get the hang of it.

John,
The few LEED projects I've modeled for (3), we've used unmet load for
hours for the whole building.  I like to use the Summary Tab under the
Air-Side HVAC screen to view details about my systems including unmet
load hours.  The only thing is that it's only available for the baseline
design and can't compare with any parametric runs.
Hope this helps,

I usually look through the zone report (SS-H? - the one which shows the
undercooled or underheated hours for each zone) to see if any zone has
unreasonably high numbers. Fixing these zones usually gets me a very low
number for unmet hours for the total of all zones. I would be curious to
see what others have to suggest. In your case, going through 76 zones
would be quite tedious.

All:
 
ASHRAE 90.1-2004 has design criteria for Equipment capacities on Page
176 of the Standard (G3.1.2.2). It talks about Unmet load hours on the
proposed design AND the baseline design not exceeding 300 hrs (of 8,760
Hrs), and the delta between base and proposed not differing more than 50
hours.
 
Is this WHOLE BUILDING, or BY ZONE? I have 76 zones in my building, and
to play the Unmet loads game between these two models is harder than
trying to hold water in my hands.
 
Any thoughts, interpretations, or suggestions?

John,
The few LEED projects I've modeled for (3), we've used unmet load for
hours for the whole building.  I like to use the Summary Tab under the
Air-Side HVAC screen to view details about my systems including unmet
load hours.  The only thing is that it's only available for the baseline
design and can't compare with any parametric runs.
Hope this helps, 
Brett

I usually look through the zone report (SS-H? - the one which shows the
undercooled or underheated hours for each zone) to see if any zone has
unreasonably high numbers. Fixing these zones usually gets me a very low
number for unmet hours for the total of all zones. I would be curious to
see what others have to suggest. In your case, going through 76 zones
would be quite tedious.

All:
 
ASHRAE 90.1-2004 has design criteria for Equipment capacities on Page
176 of the Standard (G3.1.2.2). It talks about Unmet load hours on the
proposed design AND the baseline design not exceeding 300 hrs (of 8,760
Hrs), and the delta between base and proposed not differing more than 50
hours.
 
Is this WHOLE BUILDING, or BY ZONE? I have 76 zones in my building, and
to play the Unmet loads game between these two models is harder than
trying to hold water in my hands.
 
Any thoughts, interpretations, or suggestions?

I recently completed a study on the effects of thermal bridging on a
residential project and approached this by looking at the average UA
value (heating) which accounts for this stud area component to the
overall wall. Uavg = U1A1 + U2A2+U3A3+... See ASHRAE 2005
Fundamentals?CH25. Depending on the level of analysis you are looking
at?UA calcs v potential moisture issues, a computer model may be
necessary.
 
Any further input on this is appreciated...

Greetings BLDG-SIMmers,
 
Has anyone run across an explanation/quantification of how an effective thermal break might be provided for metal studs installed for furring on the inside of existing concrete walls? 
 
An architect's detail from outside to inside, shows an existing 8" concrete walls abutted against a 3-5/8" metal studs with furring installed 24" o/c with batt insulation, and gyp board for the finished side. The overall U-value is certainly a lot better than the bare concrete, but it would be improved if the metal studs weren't in direct contact with the concrete. 
 
Any thoughts on how to quantify this arrangements?

Dear All,
  I am trying to do a building complex in Equest but run into some sort of a visualization problem. The program is not able to refresh the 3dmode hence making me impossible to edit the building envelope.
   
  -Can any of you suggest the maximum input file lengths that Equest can successfuly handle. (Its presently processing some 20000 lines)
  I am working on a P4,dual core processor with 2GB RAM- can the computer speed be a factor here?
   
   
  Thanks,

Hello Tara,
 
See screen 23 of the eQuest DD wizard.  There is an input for exterior
lighting in watts per square foot for the selected shell.  This
unfortunately is not the way exterior power is more generally
characterized, namely as watts per linear foot of perimeter.  
 
The input number is stored in the pd2 file, and is multiplied by the
shell square footage to obtain the EXTERIOR-POWER value in kilowatts
found in the inp file.  The EXT-USAGE keyword looks like it's used only
to assign exterior power to a particular electric meter.
 
Generally I assign all the exterior lighting load to the first floor
Shell.  You might try entering the data as described above into the
wizard, then saving the file and searching for the keywords you're
looking for in the inp file to see the syntax of how they're used.
 
HTH...

You can schedule both the gas and electric loads as processes directly

Hello Analyst/Engineers,

 

Need input on how to model fireplace and the dedicated exhaust fan.

It is 300,000Btu/h gas fire place that is used for esthetical only. All
heat is being exhausted through the chimney with 3200cfm VSD exhaust
fan.  

1.	Can somebody point me how to model this in eQuest?
2.	Since it is not used for heating purposes, I assume it should be
modeled both for baseline and proposed model?

Any input is greatly appreciated.

Thanks

Vikram,

The second answer is correct, i.e. the bhp goes in as a numerator. (746*BHP)/(1-EXP{[-0.243789*LN(BHP)]-1.685541})

I figured it out by trial and error. In one case that when I used the bhp in the denominator, the fan power increased 3 to 4 times. That immediately added heat to the supply air stream and terminated my simulation run due to an error. I hope the equation is clarified better in the next version of the document.

bests,
Neeraj

Question about Fan Power


 
 




So I'm trying to calculate fan power, and came across this mindbender



Pfan = 746 / (1 - e[ -0.2437839 ? ln( bhp ) - 1.685541 ]) ? bhp



Having done the hard part (I figured out how to automate the process in XL with just the CFM input using the natural log function ), I have only one question - does the bhp (highlighted at the end) go in the numerator or denominator of the equation?


i.e. - Should the equation read



Pfan = 746 / [(1 - e[ -0.2437839 ? ln( bhp ) - 1.685541 ]) ? bhp]



Or



Pfan = [746 / (1 - e[ -0.2437839 ? ln( bhp ) - 1.685541 ])] ? bhp



Any help is much appreciated.



Thanks

Assuming an approximate conversion at 746 W per BHP - numerator, which is divided by some motor efficiency corrections (all the logarithmic stuff) to get your Pfan in Watts.

 

For instance with 50 BHP, your numbers might give you something similar to:  746 / 0.929 x 50 = Pfan = 40.2 kW

Dear all,

How is an overhead plenum zone (unconditioned) accommodated in Ecotect? I
see that when I draw a zone, unlike in eQUEST, there's no distinction
between floor-to-floor height and floor-to-ceiling height.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200707051004.AA0440578pd80001449096@gard.com>

I am having a problem modeling a dedicated outside air handling unit in
Equest. I have followed past advice from this mailing list and also the
DOE2.2 manuals, but the OAHU is not sized correctly in my simulation
runs.
 
I have specified a constant OAcfm/sqft in each zone to simulate a
constant volume unit, and the air handling units served by the OAHU link
to it with the OA-From command. But there appears to be a problem in
that the OAHU will fail to recognize the zone OA requirements from zones
defined by floor multipliers, and therefore it is not sized properly.
For example, my 10 story building (Ground, Mid (x8), Top) will have the
OAHU sized for 3 floors only (Ground, Mid, Top).
 
Has anyone out there experienced this same problem, or know of any way
to resolve it?
 
Thanks in advance,

Dear colleagues,
 
It is my pleasure to announce to you the release of Daylight 1-2-3, a
new daylighting/energy analysis software developed jointly by the
National Research Council Canada and Natural Resources Canada. The tool
predicts the daylighting and energy performance of sidelit and/or toplit
private offices, open plan offices, and classrooms. Daylight 1-2-3 comes
with an intuitive graphical user interface and extensive help files and
should take you less than 30 minutes to learn. 
 
Daylight 1-2-3 uses a customized version of ESP-r that reads in
RADIANCE/DAYSIM-based daylight coefficients and uses the occupant
behavior model Lightswitch to predict the energy saving potential of
automated lighting controls such as occupancy sensors and
photocell-controlled dimming. Simulation outputs include the latest
generation of climate-based daylight performance metrics such as
continuous daylight autonomy, useful daylight index, and daylight
saturation percentage as well as monthly energy loads for heating,
lighting, and cooling. The effect of venetian blinds is modeled using
the SKYVISION software. For a full overview of the software please refer
to http://lightswitch.irc.nrc.ca/website/p233v1.pdf.
 
You can download the software free-of-charge from www.daylight1-2-3.com.
The software is currently available under WINDOWS only.
 
Your comments and suggestions are welcome. 
 
Happy simulations,
 

The Daylight 1-2-3 Development Team

While elevator energy use is somewhat a function of installed  
connected load it is all a function of how people move through the  
building.  Vertical transporartion is by far the most uncertain base  
building energy end use in office buildings.

We have seen a wide variation in energy use on a m2 NLA pa basis.  On  
the low end a government building with small floorplates and tenants  
who tend not to move around the building vertically other than to eat  
and go to and from work could be around 2 kWh/m2 NLA pa.  On the high  
end a CBD location with small floorplates and a tenant who is  
externally focussed (i.e. has clients / customers regularly coming  
and going) with the coffee shop at ground level could be 10 kWh/m2  
NLA pa or more.  I have heard of buildings with older control gear  
and drives that can use far more than this.

Our Lend Lease headquarters at 30 The Bond in Sydney has open  
staircases that we use to go 2-3 floors up or down.  Most people walk  
to work and arrive at the L4 entrance and thus rarely use the lifts.  
As a result while we meet a lot and have a lot of visitors our lift  
energy use is actually very low.

Richard Peters in the UK and others have been doing a lot of research  
into predicting lift energy use - interesting stuff.  Some of the  
lift manufacturers have software now that they will either use in a  
consultancy role or license to consultants to allow annual energy sue  
to be estimated from lift simulations and empirical data of how  
people typically move through buildings.

Regards,
Graham

The horsepower input to an elevator can vary quite a bit depending on
the building.  For a high rise building, elevators will typically be
rated at 50 hp each (37 kW).  This goes down incrementally with the size
of the building to about 10 hp for small elevators (7.5 kW).  These are
just numbers I have seen on projects in-house. You should try to contact
the electrical engineer for your project and they should be able to give
you a better idea of how the elevators are rated.

Going through the LEED 2.2 requirements, I see that site lighting needs
to be modeled as well. Has anyone done this in eQUEST? If so - how is it
modeled? Do you set up another lighting source with schedule? I looked
in the project & site requirements and didn't see a site lighting
option.

Also - I am assuming you model elevators in the internal loads/equipment
tab. Does anyone have experience scheduling elevator usage? What kind of
schedule do you set for them?

Lastly - the baseline requirements for Appendix G requires that there is
no self shading. Can you set that in eQUEST?

David,

I am struggling with modeling ice storage correctly as well.

But to get a fair understanding of how to go about it, refer to the
example in the DOE2 docs available in the eQUEST download area (DOE22
topics has an example input, also the DOE22 dictionary talks about
thermal storage and how its to be modeled)

The trick really lies in how you control the ice storage after having
defined it! In my case, even though the ice storage seems to be working
(not the way I would have imagined it to work though!) the chiller usage
is not going down!! Which is definitely an anomaly..

See if you can understand and use the example to your benefit....do let
me know if it works for you.

 

For the GSHP system as well, look up an example input in the DOE22
documents, though I am not sure if you still need to import the curves
for gshp systems in the latest eQUEST version. Maybe someone has
answers?

 

Good luck

Alpana

Dear all,

 

I need to model a ice storage system and a ground souce heat pump system

while but I could find enough information to model these two features.
Does someone has detail information about how to model these two systems
or someone has some example files that I take as a reference.

 

Thank you very much in advance. I really appreciate your help.

Hi Gang:
 
I am modeling a brand new multi story museum in eQuest in a 4 season
climate. The Museum has several atriums, some two story and some three
story. I have been making the atriums vertically multizoned, removing
the floors and ceilings, and creating airwalls between the atriums
levels.  I have conditioned all bottom atrium floors, conditioned the
2nd floors of the 3 story atriums, but have left the top floors of ALL
atriums unconditioned.
 
My difficulties are twofold:
 
1) This is to be an eventual LEED application, so ASHRAE 90.1-2004 is
the base building. This requires eQuest sized airflows for a 20 Deg
delta T, coil to room temperature.
 
This is resulting in airflows that are 60% down to 30% of what the
Design shows.
 
2) I also seem to undercooking many of the spaces, including the
atriums.
 
Am I modeling these atriums correctly?
 
I don't have much time to make changes, so any help is greatly
appreciated.

John,
 
My thought was that we're not so much cooling and heating the entire
space as treating it as a contiguous entity.  Can anyone outside of
Scott Criswell say with certainty that air floors and air ceilings
permit connected multifloor spaces to behave thermodynamically
equivalent to multilevel spaces?  If so, or Scott if you're out there,
please advise.  Since shells can be placed anywhere, it seems to me
there would have to be sophisticated geometrical checking between spaces
within shells to make it work.
 
Admittedly I'm usually modeling two-level spaces -- gymnasiums
cafeterias etc. so perhaps when I say the method I use produces results
that are within expectations, my expectation bar is set rather low.
 
As for underheating, on several projects I have added baseboards to
eliminate the underheating warnings/errors in the simulation report.
While it get the heating load up in the ballpark of where it needs to
be, its not a perfect solution -- but as you say... deadlines!

That should be "under heating."
 
I have seen your Atrium suggestions before. You seem to be cooling and
heating the entire atrium, which I do not believe is the case,
especially in the 3 story set up.
 
I don't have the time to rebuild my model, sad to say. deadlines..

levels.  I have conditioned all bottom atrium floors, conditioned the
2nd floors of the 3 story atriums, but have left the top floors of ALL
atriums unconditioned.
 
My difficulties are twofold:
 
1) This is to be an eventual LEED application, so ASHRAE 90.1-2004 is
the base building. This requires eQuest sized airflows for a 20 Deg
delta T, coil to room temperature.
 
This is resulting in airflows that are 60% down to 30% of what the
Design shows.
 
2) I also seem to undercooking many of the spaces, including the
atriums.
 
Am I modeling these atriums correctly?
 
I don't have much time to make changes, so any help is greatly
appreciated.

John,
 
eQuest underestimating airflows?  I suppose the next thing you're going
to tell us is that the polar ice caps are melting! ;-)  
 
FWIW, I build atriums (i.e. multilevel spaces) a bit differently, see
this post:
 
http://elcca-exchange.blogspot.com/2007/03/equest-multi-level-spaces.htm
l
 
 
They seem to work essentially as expected.
 
Also, I'm not clear on what you mean exactly by 'overcooking'.

Brandon,
 
The first thing that I would do is open up the SIM file and look at the
LS-C report (Building Peak Load Components). This report tells you what
the total building envelope loads and internal heat gains are for peak
cooling and heating conditions. Here are the categories provided:
 
WALL CONDUCTION

ROOF CONDUCTION

WINDOW GLASS+FRM COND

WINDOW GLASS SOLAR

DOOR CONDUCTION

INTERNAL SURFACE COND

UNDERGROUND SURF COND

OCCUPANTS TO SPACE

LIGHT TO SPACE

EQUIPMENT TO SPACE

PROCESS TO SPACE

INFILTRATION 

Since your building appears very insensitive to changes in glazing
U-value my guess is that this report will show that "WINDOW GLASS+FRM
COND" is small compared to the other loads or that one of these other
loads is much larger than the rest. This result may be correct,
especially if the gazing fraction of the facade is low. However, if
"UNDERGROUND SURF COND" is the largest conduction load then you may need
to set U-EFFECTIVE for the slab floors (reasonable values are between
0.01 and 0.02). 
 
You may also find that the building is much more sensitive to changes in
window solar heat gain coefficient than changes in U-value.

All,
 
I have a 3-story historic building, with circa-1920's windows on all
four exposures.  Big, beautiful, clear-glass single-pane architectural
masterpieces.  So while doing an optimization study, it became apparent
to me that substantially changing the U-value and infiltration
coefficients was having very little effect at all on the loads.
 
For example, varying the U-value from 1.27 to 0.55, 0.45 and at last
0.30 in the parametric runs using the 'simplified method' produced a
0.5% total (over all runs) change in the total energy consumption.
Selecting representative glass types using the 'library method' produced
essentially equivalent.  Superimposing upon either of these a change in
the infiltration coefficient from 1/4" to 1/8" to 1/16" to 1/32"
produced no additional effect at all (the INF-METHOD = CRACK keyword is
specified) on the annual energy consumption.
 
Lastly, I changed the baseline glass to "unglazed opening", again with a
mystifying zero net effect on the overall energy consumption.  It's as
if the glass is not being calculated at all, but I see no errors or
warnings in the SIM file.
 
Anyone have an idea on how to debug this?
 
Thanks in advance...

Brandon,
Mysterious. 
 
What's you overall building use (BTU/sf)? Is the glazing are
significant? Where is this building located? (I have done a similar
study in Hawaii where I found that single glazing performs better than
double, because the weather was good for it. 
A good quick gut check  is to look at the LS-F reports and see what
percentage of the loads are coming from window conductance.

I haven't simulated any hospitals under Appendix G, but I have done a
number of pharmaceutical and bio-research labs, which had similar specs
and requirements. 
 
My assumption is that the project intends to seek LEED certification
under LEED-NC 2.2 since you are doing an Appendix G baseline.
 
I also assume that the CUP currently exists and its capacity will not be
expanded to meet the demands of the addition, therefore you will treat
the chilled and hot water from the CUP as purchased cooling and heating
in the proposed design consistent with G3.1.1.1 (this section only
mentions purchased heat, but I think it is reasonable to apply the same
approach to campus chilled water).
 
I would classify the building type as Nonresidential and 3 Floors or
Less & < 75,000 sf, which would require System 3 to be used. Even if you
consider the addition to be part of the larger building, this approach
is still consistent with Section G3.1.1 Exception (a).  
 
I'm not sure why you don't consider this to be a fair comparison since
clearly there is a design decision to be made about connecting the
addition to the existing CUP versus independent cooling and heating
systems.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] ASHRAE 90.1-2004 App. G, Hospital Baseline


Hello all,
 
I am currently working on the ASHRAE 90.1-2004, Appendix G baseline
model of a hospital in Oregon. The part of the building being analyzed
is a 40,000 sf, 3 story addition to an already existing building of
approximately 90,000 sf. I am having some issues determining what to use
for the baseline HVAC system. Here are some key details of the current
as-designed building:

*	Reheat fan system 
*	Constant volume, 60,000 cfm 
*	100% outside air 
*	Draws heat from two boilers and two chiller in a central utility
plant that also serves the rest of the building

These design parameters lead to some confusion when selecting the HVAC
baseline systems. For example:

*	Since the addition is served by a system that serves the entire
building, should building be modeled as an ~130,000 sf building? This
would make it System 5 under Table G3.1.1A. Problems with this are that
it calls it out to be a PVAV w/ reheat, which is not a legitimate
comparison. If the baseline is supposed to be PVAV, the OSA requirements
need to be the same anyways (G3.1.2.5), therefore effectively making it
a constant volume system. 
*	Should the sf be taken relative to only the addition (40,000
sf)? This is also not a fair comparison between the two systems because
the addition draws heating and cooling from a system designed for a much
larger square footage. 

I guess my main questions are if anyone has dealt with large, constant
volume, 100% OSA systems and their baseline HVAC systems and if anyone
has modeled additions that are served by a larger CUP.
 
Thanks for any help in advance.

The part of the building being analyzed is a 40,000 sf, 3 story addition to an already existing building of approximately 90,000 sf. I am having some issues determining what to use for the baseline HVAC system. Here are some key details of the current as-designed building:

*	Reheat fan system
*	Constant volume, 60,000 cfm
*	100% outside air
*	Draws heat from two boilers and two chiller in a central utility plant that also serves the rest of the building

These design parameters lead to some confusion when selecting the HVAC baseline systems. For example:

*	Since the addition is served by a system that serves the entire building, should building be modeled as an ~130,000 sf building? This would make it System 5 under Table G3.1.1A. Problems with this are that it calls it out to be a PVAV w/ reheat, which is not a legitimate comparison. If the baseline is supposed to be PVAV, the OSA requirements need to be the same anyways (G3.1.2.5), therefore effectively making it a constant volume system.
*	Should the sf be taken relative to only the addition (40,000 sf)? This is also not a fair comparison between the two systems because the addition draws heating and cooling from a system designed for a much larger square footage. 

I guess my main questions are if anyone has dealt with large, constant volume, 100% OSA systems and their baseline HVAC systems and if anyone has modeled additions that are served by a larger CUP.
 
Thanks for any help in advance.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200707231022.AA2231328pd80001458095@gard.com>

Thanks for all the replies this morning.  I can now read errors (turns out
they are in the simulation output file readable by D2SimViewer--who would've
guessed?).

The error I currently have is: "LOOP: WELL has no attached primary heating
equipment."

Loop Well is a loop type lake/well.  Attached is a chiller of type: loop to
loop heat pump.

Any thoughts?  Thanks for everyone's help.

Robert---

What kind of HVAC system are you specifying?  Clearly whatever it is,
the program is having trouble finding an input for this parameter.  You
can probably fix the error by inputting the value in the 'detailed edit'
mode, if you are familiar yet with that term.  

Save trying to go to a class, I would recommend going through a few of
the eQUEST tutorials that are on the internet as a starting point to
learn some of the basics.  Here are some links...

Basic eQUEST tutorial that covers the basics:

http://www.doe2.com/download/equest/eQUESTv3-40_Tutorial.exe

Here's a pdf of a training workbook that Energy Design Resources put out
in Sept. 2004.  Just a heads up, it's a large file (602 pages) but
there's some good info.

http://doe2.com/download/equest/eQuestTrainingWorkbook.pdf

Here is a zip file of the examples referenced in the training workbook:

Hope that helps, good luck!

This is my first post.  I hope it gets through to the list.

I just installed eQUEST and I am trying to evaluate a simple two zone / 
two system single floor (with basement) 1500 sq. ft. building.  I keep 
getting errors asking for input as follows: "Hot Deck Supply Flow 
(HSUPPLY-FLOW) (no default)".  When I go to the input screen, everything

is filled in, and the error will not clear.

If I bypass this error, the results are bad.  It will give a screen with

"---PRELIMINARY DESIGN DOES NOT MEET TITLE 24--- ... Hours outside 
throttling range >10 Percent".  The Title 24 printout has "0" for the 
heating standard design, and basically everything is out of compliance.

I would be happy to buy a book, call an expert, or go to a class on 
eQUEST, but none of that seems to be quickly available.  This list is 
the only resource given, so I am giving it a try.

Any ideas?   Anybody?


Thanks!

I'm assuming you're talking about the '.sim' file that is created by
eQUEST for each model.  It contains the model inputs in a text file that
can be opened with any text editor (Notepad, Crimson Editor, etc.).  The
.sim file can be found in the project directory, with the same name that
you used to save your model.  Good luck.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] loop to loop heat pump

 

Hi all,

I wrote about a week ago how to model a radiant floor system heated by a
heat-pump & ground loop.

I received some answers--thanks! and have set up a test model with a
loop-to-loop heat pump type chiller, lake/well loop and induction coils.
However, when I run the program, it crashes.  I get an error message
stating that details are in a .sin file, but I can't find software to
open or read the file, so I have no idea why the file won't run. 

Any assistance on how to read the .sin file, or changing the file so
that it will run would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Sean, we have found 2 options - one being EnergyPro from Gabel Dodd in
CA - it is CA Title 24 energy code compliance software but can be
manipulated for other regions with some work in DOE2. The other ooption
is Trace 700 (though how they model it is unknown to me - they could not
give me a satisfactory answer when queried.)
 
as an aside, we are currently getting push back from some code officials
regarding refrigerant volume calculations with this system and if they
cannot be resolved by the manufacturer then I would suggest a long hard
look at the viability of this system for certain applications.
 
Peter

Kevin,

Centrifugal chillers have fewer rubbing parts and usually have a
higher airflow than reciprocating chillers.  As a result, they usually
operate at a higher COP than reciprocating chillers do.  For example,
the minimum ASHRAE (90.1-2004) COP for a reciprocating chiller is 4.2
while for a centrifugal chiller it is in the 5.0 - 6.1 range
(depending on the size of your chiller).  You should try running your
model using the higher COP and see if that helps.

Hi Jimmy:

You can use the Equipment Controls and Load Management buttons in the
lower right hand corner of the Controls Tab under Hot Water Loop under
Water Side Tab in eQuest (Detailed Edit Mode). 

You need to put in a annual schedule (as well as week and day schedule)
for the boiler sequence you want, by season. You might for example, say
(for a annual schedule BOILER-SCHED) January thru April is Boiler-Seq-1
Week-Sch), May thru Sept is Boiler-Seq-2 (Week-Sch), and Boiler Seq-1
(Week-Sch)for October thru December. Make Boiler-Seq-1 the same Day-Sch
every day (Mon-Sun+Hol) and the same for Boiler-Seq-2. The Day-Sch for
Boiler-Seq-1 will have a Flag of 1 every hour of the day (if boiler is
to be available every hour), and Boiler-Seq-2 and Flag of 2 for every
hour of the Day-Sch.

The flag is input in the day schedule. The Day-Sch with Flag = 2 will
have ONLY your summer boiler scheduled. The day-Sch with Flag = 1 will
have only your winter boiler scheduled.  The equipment annual schedule
will be input in the Qualification Schedule entry on the General Tab of
the Load management inputs.

Hope this isn't too confusing. All BLDG-SIM members, make sure I said
this correctly.

hi-
i'm trying to use 2 different boilers serving same hot water loop at
different times of the year.
i couldnt figure out if there's a simple method to schedule such that
one boiler is on for winter and the other kicks in  summer, if needed.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200707181651.AA5148703pd80001456280@gard.com>

Karen,
I just modeled a similar system in eQuest.  The central loop to loop heat
pump worked out pretty well for me.  You have to set up the model (with all
the necessary loops and pumps) in the detailed mode in eQuest.  I ran into a
few quirks....I've been meaning to send them on to Jeff, but I'll just post
them here instead.  They are only interface issues.


   - When creating a second HP type chiller by copying my first one, it
   asks me to create a new pump.  After I create that pump it never lets
   me out of the 'Required Chiller Data' dialogue box.  I ended up having
   to close eQuest with the task manager and couldn't save my file.


   - When creating a HP chiller from scratch, eQuest asks for a CHW loop,
   HW loop, and CW loop.  The CW loop must be a lake/well loop but that
   isn't one of the options you're given to create.  It's possible to get
   through this issue without things crashing, but it involved randomly
   clicking on cancel a half-dozen times.


   - When I try to change the pump 'motor class' and 'capacity control'
   in the spreadsheet tab, I get errors.

The other thing that it sounds like you'll run into is that you can't put a
boiler on the same loop as your heat pump.  I had to create a separate HW
loop to model back-up energy use from a boiler for the building I was
modeling.  I modeled the radiant system as induction units with fan power
set to zero.

Good luck,
Aleka


Hi All,

I have a question regarding eQuest:

I'm modeling a house that will use a ground source heat pump with boiler
backup as a heat source.  The heat pumps will heat water that is circulated
through radiant tubing in the floor.  Is a loop-to-loop heat pump a good way
to model this?  I've done some research on it, but am not sure whether this
can be modeled in eQuest either in the wizards or parametric runs without
changing the BDL file directly.

How are my options for modeling cooling systems limited with the heating
system described above?

Any help is appreciated.

Thank You,

~Karen~

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200707181306.AA0618703pd80001456077@gard.com>

All;

I should have known this already, but Jeff Hirsch clarified that DOE-2
users may need to adjust (carefully) the relative
COOLING/HEATING-DESIGN-Ts in buffer zones if auto-sizing airflows. I
USUALLY find the default minimum design airflows and safety factors
result in adequate airflows in the conditioned zones. However:

 

--- 
Jeff Hirsch responded:

Relative to the dT used for the interior wall heat transfer ... 

  

The hourly simulated heat transfer across an interior wall is based on
the hourly 

simulated temperatures on either side of the wall.  The design
calculation heat transfer 

across an interior wall is governed ONLY be the design temperatures of
the zones on 

either side of the wall. 

  

The "adjust loads" feature controls if the peak load arising from the
hourly fixed temperature

load calculation for each SPACE is "adjusted" during the HVAC sizing
calculation based

upon the specified heat/cool design temperatures for the ZONE that
represents that SPACE

for the HVAC simulation. 

  

The unconditioned and plenum design temperatures can start as a "guess"
and then be 

adjusted based upon simulation values.  There is no automated "capture"
of design day 

unconditioned/plenum zone temperatures at the time of each connected
conditioned 

zone peak load to feed into the calculation.  This is not unique to
DOE-2/eQUEST, but 

we are adding a better method to handle this and other sizing issues
automatically in 

the next version of DOE-2 (expected next year) 

  

From JJH's response above, if the design temperatures are the same for a
"plenum" and the space below, there will be no heat transfer during the
sizing calculation; that's why changing "plenum" roof characteristics
did not change design airflow in the conditioned space below the
ceiling.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] What does ADJUST-LOADS adjust?

 

All;
When simulating (eQ v3-61, DOE-2.2 v44e4) a building with a "plenum"
(unconditioned or plenum), and changing the roof absorptance greatly,
the auto-sized design air flow does NOT seem to change in the zone
below, even though the ZONE SIZING-OPTION = ADJUST-LOADS. After
observing this in a big model, I tested this in a simple single zone
model (eQ Wiz). I made sure airflow sizing was driven by cooling loads,
and created a parametric run that changed the ABSORPTANCE of the roof
construction between 90% and 10%. Hourly cooling loads vary as expected,
but design airflow remains the same between both models. 

Raising the DESIGN-COOL-T (from the default 75F, same for all zones) in
the "plenum" increases the design airflow in the zone below (for both
absorptances), but I thought ADJUST-LOADS did more than just recognize
this input. The problem seems to persist whether I have a cooling design
day or not, and whatever I do with the LOADS SPACE "TEMPERATUREs" and
ZONE DESIGN-COOL-Ts. 

Any insights out there? Anyone else notice this behavior? Is this a bug,
or did I expect too much of the program? Unless the DESIGN-COOL-T is
raised (to a value one must estimate or find by inspection of hourly
reports), it appears the program under-sizes airflow to zones where a
significant fraction of the heat gain is through a ceiling
cavity/plenum/attic, or I suppose any "un-conditioned" buffer space.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] eQUEST warning messages: HSUPPLY, DHW Loop Pump, CURINV
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200707171125.AA2549203pd80001455497@gard.com>

I am modeling a building in eQUEST with the following HVAC system types:
PTAC, UVT, MZS, PMZS.  The building is situated in New York City, where code
ventilation requirements for the baseline model require exhaust rates
roughly triple ASHRAE 62 guidelines (those requirements will be changing
shortly).  It is a 15 story multifamily building comprised of 5 shells due
to different floor shapes and zoning patterns.  I am having difficulty
understanding three of the warning messages and thought I would see if other
have experienced/solved these problems before.  Thanks in advance!

1)  I am pretty sure this warning message pertains to the MZS or PMZS
because they are the only two air-side systems with HSUPPLY specified in the
INP file.

**WARNING**********************************************************************

             User-specified HSUPPLY-CFM is larger than
             available return air.  Heating capacity may
             be inadequate.
I checked the BEPS report and it shows that
"PERCENT OF HOURS ANY SYSTEM ZONE OUTSIDE OF THROTTLING RANGE = 86.0
PERCENT OF HOURS ANY PLANT LOAD NOT SATISFIED                =  0.0"

2)  I tried increasing the "Pump Head" under "Domestic Water
Heater/Attachments" in the DDI from the default of 1 to several other
values, but the warning message always spits back a number that is 5 ft
greater than whatever I enter under "Pump Head".  E.g., I enter Pump Head =
100, it spits back a loop head of 105 in the warning message.
 **WARNING**********************************************************************
             Pump: DHW Loop Pump                    has a user-specified
head
             of         1. feet, but the loop head is       6. feet.

3)  Per a recommendation from Mike Tillou on the BLDG-SIM archive, I tried
changing all curves in the model to "default", but that did not remove the
following error message (which repeats for literally hundreds of pages).
CURINV: No real root for CURVE:
 1  1.353483  0.015932 -0.369414  0.000000  0.000000  0.000000
CURINV: No real root for CURVE:
 1  1.353483  0.015932 -0.369414  0.000000  0.000000  0.000000
CURINV: No real root for CURVE:
 1  1.353483  0.015932 -0.369414  0.000000  0.000000  0.000000


(Background):
Even though I think I've figured out the source of this warning message, I
thought I'd include it in case it's relevant to understanding the warning
messages above.

This warning is coming from the exhaust rates being specified higher than
outdoor air intake rates.
**WARNING**********************************************************************
             ZONE EL1 ESE Perim Zn ( G.ESE1)        in SYSTEM EL1 Sys1
(PTAC) (G.ESE1)
             has unused EXHAUST-CFM specified.
             This has been converted to outside air.

Thank you so much!  Looking forward to hearing back from those with
thoughts/insights/experiences on this.

Best,
Andy

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200707170427.AA2753343pd80001455246@gard.com>

Dear All,

 

Recently I requested help (and got it, thank you very much) with regard to the heating and cooling demand of a 20 sqm zone representing a room in a building with one fa?ade fully glazed and a fan coil unit specified. After consideration it was concluded that the heating demand calculated with eQuest was reasonable however the cooling demand was very very small. The chiller chosen was an electric-hermetic-reciprocating chiller (at random because I didn't know any better) with an EIR of 0.25 (COP=4.0) and after a long time investigating I changed the chiller to a electric-hermetic-centrifugal chiller and kept the EIR at 0.25. This resulted in the cooling load quadrupling! Does anybody know why this should be the case when every other parameter remained the same?

If return air is via plenum then the volume connected to the return  
air is the same.  My guess is that EQuest/2.2 does not try to do a  
CO2 balance and is thus working off occupant density and outdoor air  
(probably from mechanical systems only) so volume may be  
inconsequential.  For large spaces with transient occupancy this  
could be inaccurate - codes in Australia allow us to take advantage  
of this large volume of unvitiated air for theatre foyers etc.  If  
EQuest/2.2 did do a transient CO2 balance then the inaccurracies of  
modelling with no plenum would be limited to transient conditions  
which for offices would be morning, evening and lunch.  In this case  
I gues your simulation would be slightly optimistic.  I assume Steve  
Gates / Jeff Hirsch can clarify anything that isn't stated in the 2.2  
Dictionary.

Lynn:
 
My interpretation of the NEW FEATURES section in DOE-2.2 explanation of
DCV is that it responds to the outside air requirement. The User decides
whether that is base on outside air per person or per square foot. So I
believe outside air has to be established on a CFM/person basis. The OSA
would not have any tie between to people if it was stated on a CFM/sf
basis.

Thanks to everyone who responded to the threads that came from the
original question. With respect to the note immediately below, how is
the demand for outside air determined when DCV is modeled in eQuest? I
was assuming the inputs would be the number of occupants (and their
activity levels) and the volume of the space. If deleted plenum volumes
are re-assigned to occupied spaces, the CO2 concentration (and
presumably OA fraction) should clearly be reduced in a real-life DCV
situation. Does the eQuest model of DCV take this into account or is it
more simplified?

John, that is a good point if your program is modeling the CO2
concentration explicitly.

 

If you (or simulation program) are using the scheduled quantity of
people as the surrogate for CO2 measurements then it would be the same
amount of OA with or without plenums.

 

(How ironic is that?  Using number of people in the model as the
surrogate for CO2 measurements...which in the real building is the
surrogate for the number of people...)

The plenums subtract from the total room volume.  If the return is
ducted, this makes a large difference.  Also while the plenum & room may
have the same or nearly the same temp/humidity, ventilation rates for
the room might be calculated based on a CO2 level difference.  The CO2
calculation is based on the room volume, which relates directly with OA
needed, and hence the energy to condition that OA.  The plenum can mean
a big difference in room volume flows when extrapolated across an entire
building.

Valid concerns, to be sure.  But are there not simpler ways to account
for the additional air and energy than carrying the additional
'overhead' (no pun intended) of plenums in a simulation?  And wouldn't
additional outside air tend to 'err' (no homophone intended) on the side
of conservancy when projecting energy consumption?  Lastly, when doing
comparative analyses, wouldn't the additional air (and energy) for the
plenums tend to 'cancel out'?
 
Am not suggesting omitting plenums for final, dialed-in load
calculations.  But for schematic design or design development-level
comparative energy analyses, dropping the plenums can save the analyst
significant speculative busy-work when extrapolated across a large
building.  
 
Just our methodology for the above types of projects, FWIW.

Lynn,

 

Do you really need the plenums?  Personally I find them non-value-added
for most of our energy study work.  Suggest specifying ceiling height
equal to floor-to-floor height in the DD wizard to make them disappear.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Oh, what a tangled web we weave...

I am using eQuest to model an office building with 3 unique floors, many
spaces (with diff't use types) per floor and plenums between floors. I
have already defined the appropriate footprints for each floor and
imported them into a single model. NBD. Because there are many spaces
per floor and plenums assume the shape of the space they sit over, it
seemed like a good idea to import the plenums as separate, floor-shaped
spaces. This was to allow internal floors and ceilings of the non-plenum
spaces to be specified as NEXT-TO the appropriate plenum without any
concern for the shape of the plenum. If each space on, say, Floor1 had
an associated plenum reflecting the space shape, the spaces on Floor2
would not line up with those plenums. I defined neither a floor or
ceiling for the plenums so that interior floors and ceilings would be
part of the occupied spaces. As I'm sure many of you are thinking, DOE2
doesn't like that arrangement and requires at least two TILTs among the
interior surfaces, i.e. walls + floor, walls + ceiling or floor +
ceiling. If I put a floor in the 1st-floor plenum, I need to specify
which space it is NEXT-TO and the approach falls apart. Obviously, the
same deal applies to plenum ceilings. Has anyone got any ideas of how to
work around this? Is it better to just associate the plenums with the
spaces below them and let the chips fall where they may when the
separate floors are imported (i.e. can heat transfer from/to plenums be
ignored?)? Am I missing something really obvious?

 

Thanks in advance.

The plenums subtract from the total room volume.  If the return is
ducted, this makes a large difference.  Also while the plenum & room may
have the same or nearly the same temp/humidity, ventilation rates for
the room might be calculated based on a CO2 level difference.  The CO2
calculation is based on the room volume, which relates directly with OA
needed, and hence the energy to condition that OA.  The plenum can mean
a big difference in room volume flows when extrapolated across an entire
building.

I am using eQuest to model an office building with 3 unique floors, many
spaces (with diff't use types) per floor and plenums between floors. I
have already defined the appropriate footprints for each floor and
imported them into a single model. NBD. Because there are many spaces
per floor and plenums assume the shape of the space they sit over, it
seemed like a good idea to import the plenums as separate, floor-shaped
spaces. This was to allow internal floors and ceilings of the non-plenum
spaces to be specified as NEXT-TO the appropriate plenum without any

an associated plenum reflecting the space shape, the spaces on Floor2
would not line up with those plenums. I defined neither a floor or
ceiling for the plenums so that interior floors and ceilings would be
part of the occupied spaces. As I'm sure many of you are thinking, DOE2
doesn't like that arrangement and requires at least two TILTs among the
interior surfaces, i.e. walls + floor, walls + ceiling or floor +
ceiling. If I put a floor in the 1st-floor plenum, I need to specify
which space it is NEXT-TO and the approach falls apart. Obviously, the
same deal applies to plenum ceilings. Has anyone got any ideas of how to
work around this? Is it better to just associate the plenums with the

Hi Aleka,
 
A different sort of question comes to mind.  Once heated to 180F, what is
the fluid return temperature?  If above 110F it seems like it will heat the
geothermal loop from the boiler.  Another possibility is to select the
fan-coils units to work using the 110F supply.  Otherwise, the
fan-coil/boiler loop may need to be completely separate.
 
Good luck,

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] central heat pumps and circulation loops


Hi all,
I'm trying to model a central ground water source heat pump serving hot &
cold water loops for a radiant heating & cooling system in eQuest.  The 110
F hot water loop from the heat pump (loop to loop HP type chiller) serves
the radiant system directly, and has a secondary loop with a boiler attached
to it to bring the temperature up from 110 F to 180 F to serve some fan coil
units.  
I'm having a hard time configuring the loops and plant equipment to even
approximate this system.  Has anyone tried to model something like this in
eQuest?  From what I understanding, you can't put a boiler on a secondary
loop, and I'm hitting a wall with that.  If I put the boiler and the HP on
the same primary loop, I get errors that tell me 180 F is too high a
temperature for a GSHP water loop.  The closest I seem to be able to get is
to model the system with two separate HW loops - one for the fan coils with
only a boiler and one for the radiant system with the HP.  But, then I can't
use the heat pump to preheat for the FCU loop with this model.  

Any thoughts?

Thanks,
Aleka

The way it is written (and the way we've been instructed to review it as
USGBC LEED reviewers), you are permitted to apply any of the addenda to
your project.  However, for each addendum you choose to apply, the
entire addendum applies, and it applies to any other relevant LEED
points.  Paul's example is correct: since both the 25,000 square foot
threshold and the normalized glazing revision are included as part of
addendum a, you would have to follow both of these requirements if you
choose to apply that addendum to the project.  However, you are not
required to apply other addenda to the project just because you chose to
follow addendum a.

Paul,

My interpretation of the USGBC ruling is the same as yours, I think.
You 
cannot pick and choose which items in ASHRAE addenda to use on your LEED
project.  You have to choose either 90.1-2004 with no addenda or
90.1-2004
with addenda which would include ALL the published adddenda that apply
to 
ALL chapters of 90.1-2004 not just Appendix G.  There are currently 42
addenda to ASHRAE 90.1-2004 (a-v,x,y,aa-ae,ag-ar,av...I hope I didn't
miss
any) This decision would also impact your compliance with the EA energy 
performance pre-requisite.

As you said "messy".

I think that all the 90.1-2004 addenda will eventually be published as
ASHRAE 90.1-2007 which will simplify keeping track of all the changes.

Has anyone read the fine print referenced in these strings to reach this
conclusion:

If you are modeling under 90.1-2004 Appendix G for LEED and opt to not 
normalize the glazing by orientation under addendum a, then you must
also
except the other portions of addendum a, most notably the revised area
threshold of 25,000 sf for the base HVAC system in Table G3.1.1A.

It seems like a messy and perhaps unintentional convergence of standard
and
policy adoption but it also seems like it is there in black and white.
Any
other conclusions?

The requirement to  distribute fenestration uniformly in horizontal

the

Appendix G notes that for the Baseline building: "Vertical fenestration
areas for new buildings and additions shall equal that in the proposed
design or 40% of gross above grade wall area, whichever is smaller, and 
shall be distributed uniformly in horizontal bands across the four
orientations."
Does this mean that the Baseline building gets windows on all walls on
each
orientation whether or not the Design case has a window in all walls on
each 
orientation.  For example, if the west orientation has 30% glazing
overall
but many spaces have no windows - some walls on the west face have more
that
30%.  Do those spaces in the Baseline case get 30% glazing?  Or do I
only 
put windows in the Baseline case where there are windows in the Design
case.

Thanks for any help!

Dear Fellow Energy modelers,

The following posting has been placed on the USGBC website (
http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=2664 ), which allows the
use of
ASHRAE Addenda for all credits referencing ASHRAE standards.


Use of approved Addenda for ASHRAE Standards referenced in LEED

Background:
ASHRAE currently publishes Continuous Maintenance standards every three 
years, with a Supplement published eighteen months after the Standard is
published. In rare cases, addenda are published in between the
eighteen-month periods. LEED development and ASHRAE standards
development
are not aligned and many addenda have been approved that would be useful
for
LEED project teams.

Action:
LEED project teams are required to use the ASHRAE Standard referenced in
the
applicable Reference Guide and are permitted to use addenda within the
most 
recent Supplement to that Standard, as well as any approved addenda
published in between the eighteen-month periods. Project teams are
responsible for notifying LEED reviewers of the use of ASHRAE addenda
utilized at the time of project documentation submission. 
If a project team elects to use an addendum to an ASHRAE Standard, this
addendum must be applied to the entire LEED submittal.
This should make fenestration modeling much easier for the Baseline Case
for
projects opting to follow the Addendum.

The way it is written (and the way we've been instructed to review it as
USGBC LEED reviewers), you are permitted to apply any of the addenda to your
project.  However, for each addendum you choose to apply, the entire
addendum applies, and it applies to any other relevant LEED points.  Paul's
example is correct: since both the 25,000 square foot threshold and the
normalized glazing revision are included as part of addendum a, you would
have to follow both of these requirements if you choose to apply that
addendum to the project.  However, you are not required to apply other
addenda to the project just because you chose to follow addendum a.

Paul,

My interpretation of the USGBC ruling is the same as yours, I think.  You
cannot pick and choose which items in ASHRAE addenda to use on your LEED
project.  You have to choose either 90.1-2004 with no addenda or 90.1-2004
with addenda which would include ALL the published adddenda that apply to
ALL chapters of 90.1-2004 not just Appendix G.  There are currently 42
addenda to ASHRAE 90.1-2004 (a-v,x,y,aa-ae,ag-ar,av...I hope I didn't miss
any) This decision would also impact your compliance with the EA energy
performance pre-requisite. 

As you said "messy".

I think that all the 90.1-2004 addenda will eventually be published as
ASHRAE 90.1-2007 which will simplify keeping track of all the changes.  

Regards,

Mike

Has anyone read the fine print referenced in these strings to reach this
conclusion:

If you are modeling under 90.1-2004 Appendix G for LEED and opt to not
normalize the glazing by orientation under addendum a, then you must also
except the other portions of addendum a, most notably the revised area
threshold of 25,000 sf for the base HVAC system in Table G3.1.1A.

It seems like a messy and perhaps unintentional convergence of standard and
policy adoption but it also seems like it is there in black and white.  Any
other conclusions?

Thanks,

The requirement to  distribute fenestration uniformly in horizontal bands
across the four orientations has been removed from Appendix G in the
published Addenda Supplement to 90.1, 2004. See the ASHRAE website for the
supplement.

Appendix G notes that for the Baseline building: "Vertical fenestration
areas for new buildings and additions shall equal that in the proposed
design or 40% of gross above grade wall area, whichever is smaller, and
shall be distributed uniformly in horizontal bands across the four
orientations."
Does this mean that the Baseline building gets windows on all walls on each
orientation whether or not the Design case has a window in all walls on each
orientation.  For example, if the west orientation has 30% glazing overall
but many spaces have no windows - some walls on the west face have more that
30%.  Do those spaces in the Baseline case get 30% glazing?  Or do I only
put windows in the Baseline case where there are windows in the Design case.

Thanks for any help!

Dear Fellow Energy modelers,

The following posting has been placed on the USGBC website (
http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=2664), which allows the use of
ASHRAE Addenda for all credits referencing ASHRAE standards.


Use of approved Addenda for ASHRAE Standards referenced in LEED

Background:
ASHRAE currently publishes Continuous Maintenance standards every three
years, with a Supplement published eighteen months after the Standard is
published. In rare cases, addenda are published in between the
eighteen-month periods. LEED development and ASHRAE standards development
are not aligned and many addenda have been approved that would be useful for
LEED project teams.

Action:
LEED project teams are required to use the ASHRAE Standard referenced in the
applicable Reference Guide and are permitted to use addenda within the most
recent Supplement to that Standard, as well as any approved addenda
published in between the eighteen-month periods. Project teams are
responsible for notifying LEED reviewers of the use of ASHRAE addenda
utilized at the time of project documentation submission.
If a project team elects to use an addendum to an ASHRAE Standard, this
addendum must be applied to the entire LEED submittal.
This should make fenestration modeling much easier for the Baseline Case for
projects opting to follow the Addendum.




Best Regards,

Gail Stranske

I'm trying to model a central ground water source heat pump serving hot &
cold water loops for a radiant heating & cooling system in eQuest.  The 110
F hot water loop from the heat pump (loop to loop HP type chiller) serves
the radiant system directly, and has a secondary loop with a boiler attached
to it to bring the temperature up from 110 F to 180 F to serve some fan coil
units.
I'm having a hard time configuring the loops and plant equipment to even
approximate this system.  Has anyone tried to model something like this in
eQuest?  From what I understanding, you can't put a boiler on a secondary
loop, and I'm hitting a wall with that.  If I put the boiler and the HP on
the same primary loop, I get errors that tell me 180 F is too high a
temperature for a GSHP water loop.  The closest I seem to be able to get is
to model the system with two separate HW loops - one for the fan coils with
only a boiler and one for the radiant system with the HP.  But, then I can't
use the heat pump to preheat for the FCU loop with this model.

Any thoughts?

Thanks,
Aleka

FYI

ASHRAE has developed a toolkit for calculating loadshapes from 8760 data, RP1093. You can get a copy of the toolkit by contacting Mike Vaughn at ASHRAE. The toolkit uses an interquartile analysis to calc the load shapes and also produces a snippet of DOE-2, BLAST and EP code with the coded loadshape. The final report and 2 papers also have a literature search that contains refs to other studies.

All, 

 

We are trying to verify if its possible to smooth out 8760 load shape in eQUEST to represent the a wider population versus a single building. DOE2 is this an option (I believe), but it is still possible in eQUEST. Our issue is this, when generating 8760 load shape profile, the output file produces a load shape that reflects the load shape associated with a single structure. However, what we want would be a load shape that captures the variability in the operating schedules associated with buildings in the population.  We would be very interested to know how and if this is possible to smooth the load shape generated in eQUEST.  Thank you,

Has anyone read the fine print referenced in these strings to reach this
conclusion:

If you are modeling under 90.1-2004 Appendix G for LEED and opt to not
normalize the glazing by orientation under addendum a, then you must
also except the other portions of addendum a, most notably the revised
area threshold of 25,000 sf for the base HVAC system in Table G3.1.1A.

It seems like a messy and perhaps unintentional convergence of standard
and policy adoption but it also seems like it is there in black and
white.  Any other conclusions?

The requirement to  distribute fenestration uniformly in horizontal

the published Addenda Supplement to 90.1, 2004. See the ASHRAE website
for the supplement.

Appendix G notes that for the Baseline building: "Vertical fenestration
areas for new buildings and additions shall equal that in the proposed
design or 40% of gross above grade wall area, whichever is smaller, and
shall be distributed uniformly in horizontal bands across the four
orientations."
Does this mean that the Baseline building gets windows on all walls on
each orientation whether or not the Design case has a window in all
walls on each orientation.  For example, if the west orientation has 30%
glazing overall but many spaces have no windows - some walls on the west
face have more that 30%.  Do those spaces in the Baseline case get 30%
glazing?  Or do I only put windows in the Baseline case where there are
windows in the Design case.

Thanks for any help!

Thanks Gail very much for the notification,

Dear Fellow Energy modelers,

The following posting has been placed on the USGBC website (
http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=2664), which allows the
use of ASHRAE Addenda for all credits referencing ASHRAE standards.


Use of approved Addenda for ASHRAE Standards referenced in LEED

Background:
ASHRAE currently publishes Continuous Maintenance standards every three
years,
with a Supplement published eighteen months after the Standard is
published. In rare
cases, addenda are published in between the eighteen-month periods. LEED
development and ASHRAE standards development are not aligned and many
addenda
have been approved that would be useful for LEED project teams.

Action:
LEED project teams are required to use the ASHRAE Standard referenced in
the
applicable Reference Guide and are permitted to use addenda within the
most recent
Supplement to that Standard, as well as any approved addenda published
in between the
eighteen-month periods. Project teams are responsible for notifying LEED
reviewers of
the use of ASHRAE addenda utilized at the time of project documentation
submission.
If a project team elects to use an addendum to an ASHRAE Standard, this
addendum
must be applied to the entire LEED submittal.
This should make fenestration modeling much easier for the Baseline Case
for projects opting to follow the Addendum.




Best Regards,

Gail Stranske

I would have thought the 300 of 8,760 would be on a zone by zone  
basis and then system by system basis so number of zones shouldn't  
impact it.  But I practice in Australia and I haven't looked through  
90.1 since the 1989 revision when I was in Canada ... so just an  
opinion.

Also the SS-R report is very useful, particularly for VAV systems.   
It will show you how the zone air volumes are distributed as a % of  
design and reports loads under-cooled and under-heated by zone.   
However a few years back I came across a lot of hours under-heated or  
under-cooled and couldn't work out why.  Turns out it includes any  
hours the fans run which could be for night purge when setpoints are  
not being held.  To my knowledge this hasn't been changed.  I am  
unsure whether loads not met works the same way (i.e. includes night  
purge hours) ...

FYI...

 

This would be really tricky...in EQUEST, as in DOE-2, one would need to
make sure the CWFs are turned on, and all walls, roofs, etc. are
layered. In addition, one would need proper framing-factors for the
walls, and if the building is slab on grade, effective u-values
following Winklemann's method. One would need to look at the BDL to
ascertain this.

 

Then comes the fun part...since a simulation like DOE-2 or EQUEST might
not really be simulating what is going on, one need to have "effective
parameters" for the coupling of the thermal mass to the interior node,
etc. 

 

For example, see the paper by Janet Manke and Doug Hittle in the 1985
ASME Conference proceedings that used "effective" parameters to best
represent the thermal mass, convection and radiation exchange within a
building. There are other papers that have addressed this issue using
TRNSYS by Jim Braun, et al. in the ASHRAE literature. I believe there
was also an ASHRAE Research Project on this as well.

 

Beware....

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Modeling Thermal Mass in eQUEST

 

All,

 

We're trying to model thermal mass effects on load shifting for a
non-residential building for the Savings By Design program.

 

Title-24 references tables for thermal mass savings for low-rise
residential depending on the constructions present.  From my
understanding, EnergyPro follows the ways of the T-24 energy code, and
really doesn't model thermal mass for what it is.  

 

I know eQUEST requires the "Layers Input" for the program to assign a
mass to the construction (and not the "U-Value Input").  

 

Does eQUEST also reference tables (similar to the T-24 energy code), or
are there some genuine calculations made?

 

Thanks again,

R. Ryan Hammond, LEED(r) AP

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200707101631.AA311178pd80001451995@gard.com>

All, 

 

We are trying to verify if its possible to smooth out 8760 load shape in
eQUEST to represent the a wider population versus a single building.
DOE2 is this an option (I believe), but it is still possible in eQUEST.
Our issue is this, when generating 8760 load shape profile, the output
file produces a load shape that reflects the load shape associated with
a single structure. However, what we want would be a load shape that
captures the variability in the operating schedules associated with
buildings in the population.  We would be very interested to know how
and if this is possible to smooth the load shape generated in eQUEST.
Thank you,

FYI. 

I believe you'll find several ORNL reports on thermal bridging, including simulations and measurements. There have also been a number of papers in the Thermal Envelopes proceedings, and ASHRAE proceedings. There has also been a lot of discussion about this at the 90.1 Envelope subcommittee.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] thermal breaks for metal studs inside concrete walls

Greetings BLDG-SIMmers,
 
Has anyone run across an explanation/quantification of how an effective thermal break might be provided for metal studs installed for furring on the inside of existing concrete walls? 
 
An architect's detail from outside to inside, shows an existing 8" concrete walls abutted against a 3-5/8" metal studs with furring installed 24" o/c with batt insulation, and gyp board for the finished side. The overall U-value is certainly a lot better than the bare concrete, but it would be improved if the metal studs weren't in direct contact with the concrete. 
 
Any thoughts on how to quantify this arrangements?

In DOE2.1E and in DOE2.2/eQuest, you can view the number of unmet loads
hours on a zone-by-zone basis in the SS-F report. This reports the
number of hours that the zone loads were not met broken down by month
and by category (i.e. heating or cooling).

In addition, the BEPU report gives you the total of unmet loads hours as
a percentage for the system simulation and the central plant simulation.
Be aware that the system unmet loads fraction can be misleading as it is
the number of zone loads not met by the system summed over all the
zones. Therefore, if one zone has unmet loads for 8760 hours then the
fraction will be reported as 100% even if all the other zones have zero
unmet loads. 

With regard to the loads not met by the plant in the BEPU report, if
these occur at the same time as an unmet system load there will be
double counting of loads not met by the simulation.

My own view is that the Appendix G definition of unmet loads unfairly
penalises simulations with large numbers of zones. For example, in a 10
zone simulation, each zone would need to have 30 hours with unmet loads
to reach the 300 hour limit. But in a simulation with 100 zones each
zone would only need 3 hours of unmet loads to reach 300 unmet loads
hours. 

If I were to rewrite the relevant section of Appendix G to correct this
problem I would multiply the number of hours of unmet load for each zone
by that zone's fraction of building floor area. This would normalise the
measurement of unmet loads to the size of the building and the number of
zones in the simulation so that the maximum possible percentage of unmet
loads would be 100%.

You can click on the building level in the left-hand panel explorer when
you are in the air-side module of eQuest, and then go to the summary
tab.  It will summarize the zones and systems that have unmet loads.

(If you have selected a particular air system in the explorer you will
get the summary for only that system rather than all of the systems.)

I haven't experimented enough to know how it calculates the "building
total" unmet hours...if simultaneous unmet zones/systems count double or
not.  It does provide an overall project system unmet hours for you to
use.

The temperature and humidity reports are also useful in the full output
-- in the sim viewer program you can scroll through the zones with the
down arrow once you've selected the desired report to spot any irregular
temperatures.  This might be hard to spot that one spurious hour, but it
will help you see if you are getting a lot of unmet hours at a time you
thought the system was supposed to off for example, or if the unmet
hours are at start-up.  Or perhaps there is a zone that has high
temperatures in winter due to a west facing window and the cooling is
off.

Last idea, make sure you have consistent zone setpoint schedules and
zone design heating and cooling temperatures.  Maybe you have changed
the setpoint schedules during the project and not gone back to the
design setpoint to make the corresponding change.

 Hello,

 

I have been trying to model water-to-water gshp in a heating only
residential building, supplemented with a boiler and feeds into baseboard
heating and a rooftop make up air unit for air-side.  The system has heat
recovery and there is no cooling.

 

Thus far I have only been able to connect a lake/well ground source heat
exchanger to a chiller via cold water loop.  I have the chiller equipment
capacity at zero to resemble no cooling.  The airside rooftop unit I am
using is of type packaged single zone and has the hot water loop connected
to the heating coil and baseboard.

 

I have confirmed with a colleague who is also modeling water-to-water heat
pumps from a ground source heat exchanger that this would be the way to do
it.

 

Would psz be appropriate for the airside system type, the only compliable
choices or PVAV PVVT and PSZ and this is not a variable volume?

 

Please let me know if I need to clarify anything further.  I would
appreciate hearing any insight on this situation and modeling water-to-water
gshp. Thank you.

 

 

Kevin

Kristin:

Thanks for your reply. I will forward your response to the list.

If the standards only address sensible load, I'm wondering whether the Unmet Load Hours is sufficient to evaluate the performance of a HVAC system, especially in humid climate where indoor humidity control is an essential part of the HVAC system. Since indoor humidity control may consume significant energy depending on the equipment/system used, I think the unmet latent load or the indoor humidity level should also be accounted for in the building energy performance evaluation to get fair comparison between proposed and baseline building designs.

Xiaobing,

I tried to send this email to the list, but there's a
glitch that doesn't allow my messages to get through. 
Anyway, here's my response for you at least:

My interpretation is that the standard is addressing
sensible load only and that it is for building-wide
hours of load unmet, not by zone.  Anyone disagree?

For eQUEST/DOE-2.2, this would mean that I'd say to
use the number on the BEPS report instead of from the
SS-R reports (although those are very helpful to look
at for other reasons).

Elliot:
 
Simple as pie.
 
The Design Development Wizard (DD Wizard) allows one to draw different
shell (floors, if you will) shapes, which can be either separate
buildings or separate floors. You can also import AutoCAD .DWG files to
trace each floor from.
 
I believe eQuest Tutorial Item Tab 3 (Example: 7th and Lane) outlines a
bit of how to approach the DD Wizard route.
 
Any building I have now usually starts in the Schematic design Wizard,
then goes to the DD Wizard to traces the floors and/or multiple
buildings. Once I have the building "cookie cuttered" out, I dive
straight to the Detailed Interface to finalize my inputs.
 
You'll get the hang of it.

All,

 

I am looking to model a building in eQuest where not all floors have the
same footprint. How can this be achieved? The tutorial doesn't detail

All:

Regarding the Unmet load, is it for sensible load only or total load (sensible and latent)?

John,
The few LEED projects I've modeled for (3), we've used unmet load for
hours for the whole building.  I like to use the Summary Tab under the
Air-Side HVAC screen to view details about my systems including unmet
load hours.  The only thing is that it's only available for the baseline
design and can't compare with any parametric runs.
Hope this helps, 
Brett

I usually look through the zone report (SS-H? - the one which shows the
undercooled or underheated hours for each zone) to see if any zone has
unreasonably high numbers. Fixing these zones usually gets me a very low
number for unmet hours for the total of all zones. I would be curious to
see what others have to suggest. In your case, going through 76 zones
would be quite tedious.

All:
 
ASHRAE 90.1-2004 has design criteria for Equipment capacities on Page
176 of the Standard (G3.1.2.2). It talks about Unmet load hours on the
proposed design AND the baseline design not exceeding 300 hrs (of 8,760
Hrs), and the delta between base and proposed not differing more than 50
hours.
 
Is this WHOLE BUILDING, or BY ZONE? I have 76 zones in my building, and
to play the Unmet loads game between these two models is harder than
trying to hold water in my hands.
 
Any thoughts, interpretations, or suggestions?

I recently completed a study on the effects of thermal bridging on a
residential project and approached this by looking at the average UA
value (heating) which accounts for this stud area component to the
overall wall. Uavg = U1A1 + U2A2+U3A3+... See ASHRAE 2005
Fundamentals?CH25. Depending on the level of analysis you are looking
at?UA calcs v potential moisture issues, a computer model may be
necessary.
 
Any further input on this is appreciated...

Greetings BLDG-SIMmers,
 
Has anyone run across an explanation/quantification of how an effective thermal break might be provided for metal studs installed for furring on the inside of existing concrete walls? 
 
An architect's detail from outside to inside, shows an existing 8" concrete walls abutted against a 3-5/8" metal studs with furring installed 24" o/c with batt insulation, and gyp board for the finished side. The overall U-value is certainly a lot better than the bare concrete, but it would be improved if the metal studs weren't in direct contact with the concrete. 
 
Any thoughts on how to quantify this arrangements?

Dear All,
  I am trying to do a building complex in Equest but run into some sort of a visualization problem. The program is not able to refresh the 3dmode hence making me impossible to edit the building envelope.
   
  -Can any of you suggest the maximum input file lengths that Equest can successfuly handle. (Its presently processing some 20000 lines)
  I am working on a P4,dual core processor with 2GB RAM- can the computer speed be a factor here?
   
   
  Thanks,

Hello Tara,
 
See screen 23 of the eQuest DD wizard.  There is an input for exterior
lighting in watts per square foot for the selected shell.  This
unfortunately is not the way exterior power is more generally
characterized, namely as watts per linear foot of perimeter.  
 
The input number is stored in the pd2 file, and is multiplied by the
shell square footage to obtain the EXTERIOR-POWER value in kilowatts
found in the inp file.  The EXT-USAGE keyword looks like it's used only
to assign exterior power to a particular electric meter.
 
Generally I assign all the exterior lighting load to the first floor
Shell.  You might try entering the data as described above into the
wizard, then saving the file and searching for the keywords you're
looking for in the inp file to see the syntax of how they're used.
 
HTH...

I am working on adding exterior lighting loads to a building simulation
and understand that eQuest responds to EXTERIOR-POWER and EXT-USAGE as
commands for this input. However, I am unsure when to enter this
information in the .inp file or what the code might look like. Has

I am working on adding exterior lighting loads to a building simulation
and understand that eQuest responds to EXTERIOR-POWER and EXT-USAGE as
commands for this input. However, I am unsure when to enter this
information in the .inp file or what the code might look like. Has
anyone had experience with exterior lighting?
 
Thank you,

You can schedule both the gas and electric loads as processes directly
on their respective meter in eQuest.  The schedule to be used would be
determined by you ahead of time.

Hello Analyst/Engineers,

 

Need input on how to model fireplace and the dedicated exhaust fan.

It is 300,000Btu/h gas fire place that is used for esthetical only. All
heat is being exhausted through the chimney with 3200cfm VSD exhaust
fan.  

1.	Can somebody point me how to model this in eQuest?
2.	Since it is not used for heating purposes, I assume it should be
modeled both for baseline and proposed model?

Any input is greatly appreciated.

Thanks

Vikram,

The second answer is correct, i.e. the bhp goes in as a numerator. (746*BHP)/(1-EXP{[-0.243789*LN(BHP)]-1.685541})

I figured it out by trial and error. In one case that when I used the bhp in the denominator, the fan power increased 3 to 4 times. That immediately added heat to the supply air stream and terminated my simulation run due to an error. I hope the equation is clarified better in the next version of the document.

bests,
Neeraj

Question about Fan Power


 
 




So I'm trying to calculate fan power, and came across this mindbender



Pfan = 746 / (1 - e[ -0.2437839 ? ln( bhp ) - 1.685541 ]) ? bhp



Having done the hard part (I figured out how to automate the process in XL with just the CFM input using the natural log function ), I have only one question - does the bhp (highlighted at the end) go in the numerator or denominator of the equation?


i.e. - Should the equation read



Pfan = 746 / [(1 - e[ -0.2437839 ? ln( bhp ) - 1.685541 ]) ? bhp]



Or



Pfan = [746 / (1 - e[ -0.2437839 ? ln( bhp ) - 1.685541 ])] ? bhp



Any help is much appreciated.



Thanks

Assuming an approximate conversion at 746 W per BHP - numerator, which is divided by some motor efficiency corrections (all the logarithmic stuff) to get your Pfan in Watts.

 

For instance with 50 BHP, your numbers might give you something similar to:  746 / 0.929 x 50 = Pfan = 40.2 kW

How is an overhead plenum zone (unconditioned) accommodated in Ecotect? I
see that when I draw a zone, unlike in eQUEST, there's no distinction

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200707051004.AA0440578pd80001449096@gard.com>

I am having a problem modeling a dedicated outside air handling unit in
Equest. I have followed past advice from this mailing list and also the
DOE2.2 manuals, but the OAHU is not sized correctly in my simulation
runs.
 
I have specified a constant OAcfm/sqft in each zone to simulate a
constant volume unit, and the air handling units served by the OAHU link
to it with the OA-From command. But there appears to be a problem in
that the OAHU will fail to recognize the zone OA requirements from zones
defined by floor multipliers, and therefore it is not sized properly.
For example, my 10 story building (Ground, Mid (x8), Top) will have the
OAHU sized for 3 floors only (Ground, Mid, Top).
 
Has anyone out there experienced this same problem, or know of any way
to resolve it?
 
Thanks in advance,

Dear colleagues,
 
It is my pleasure to announce to you the release of Daylight 1-2-3, a
new daylighting/energy analysis software developed jointly by the
National Research Council Canada and Natural Resources Canada. The tool
predicts the daylighting and energy performance of sidelit and/or toplit
private offices, open plan offices, and classrooms. Daylight 1-2-3 comes
with an intuitive graphical user interface and extensive help files and
should take you less than 30 minutes to learn. 
 
Daylight 1-2-3 uses a customized version of ESP-r that reads in
RADIANCE/DAYSIM-based daylight coefficients and uses the occupant
behavior model Lightswitch to predict the energy saving potential of
automated lighting controls such as occupancy sensors and
photocell-controlled dimming. Simulation outputs include the latest
generation of climate-based daylight performance metrics such as
continuous daylight autonomy, useful daylight index, and daylight
saturation percentage as well as monthly energy loads for heating,
lighting, and cooling. The effect of venetian blinds is modeled using
the SKYVISION software. For a full overview of the software please refer
to http://lightswitch.irc.nrc.ca/website/p233v1.pdf.
 
You can download the software free-of-charge from www.daylight1-2-3.com.
The software is currently available under WINDOWS only.
 
Your comments and suggestions are welcome. 
 
Happy simulations,
 

The Daylight 1-2-3 Development Team

While elevator energy use is somewhat a function of installed  
connected load it is all a function of how people move through the  
building.  Vertical transporartion is by far the most uncertain base  
building energy end use in office buildings.

We have seen a wide variation in energy use on a m2 NLA pa basis.  On  
the low end a government building with small floorplates and tenants  
who tend not to move around the building vertically other than to eat  
and go to and from work could be around 2 kWh/m2 NLA pa.  On the high  
end a CBD location with small floorplates and a tenant who is  
externally focussed (i.e. has clients / customers regularly coming  
and going) with the coffee shop at ground level could be 10 kWh/m2  
NLA pa or more.  I have heard of buildings with older control gear  
and drives that can use far more than this.

Our Lend Lease headquarters at 30 The Bond in Sydney has open  
staircases that we use to go 2-3 floors up or down.  Most people walk  
to work and arrive at the L4 entrance and thus rarely use the lifts.  
As a result while we meet a lot and have a lot of visitors our lift  
energy use is actually very low.

Richard Peters in the UK and others have been doing a lot of research  
into predicting lift energy use - interesting stuff.  Some of the  
lift manufacturers have software now that they will either use in a  
consultancy role or license to consultants to allow annual energy sue  
to be estimated from lift simulations and empirical data of how  
people typically move through buildings.

The horsepower input to an elevator can vary quite a bit depending on
the building.  For a high rise building, elevators will typically be
rated at 50 hp each (37 kW).  This goes down incrementally with the size
of the building to about 10 hp for small elevators (7.5 kW).  These are
just numbers I have seen on projects in-house. You should try to contact
the electrical engineer for your project and they should be able to give
you a better idea of how the elevators are rated.

Regarding your elevator question, eQUEST has a set of library schedules
for elevator usage in several types of buildings (office, apartments,
etc.)  These seem reasonable and appear to be based off of the ASHRAE
schedules that are found in the 90.1-2004 User's Manual.

Going through the LEED 2.2 requirements, I see that site lighting needs
to be modeled as well. Has anyone done this in eQUEST? If so - how is it
modeled? Do you set up another lighting source with schedule? I looked
in the project & site requirements and didn't see a site lighting
option.

Also - I am assuming you model elevators in the internal loads/equipment
tab. Does anyone have experience scheduling elevator usage? What kind of
schedule do you set for them?

Lastly - the baseline requirements for Appendix G requires that there is
no self shading. Can you set that in eQUEST?

David,

I am struggling with modeling ice storage correctly as well.

But to get a fair understanding of how to go about it, refer to the
example in the DOE2 docs available in the eQUEST download area (DOE22
topics has an example input, also the DOE22 dictionary talks about
thermal storage and how its to be modeled)

The trick really lies in how you control the ice storage after having
defined it! In my case, even though the ice storage seems to be working
(not the way I would have imagined it to work though!) the chiller usage
is not going down!! Which is definitely an anomaly..

See if you can understand and use the example to your benefit....do let
me know if it works for you.

 

For the GSHP system as well, look up an example input in the DOE22
documents, though I am not sure if you still need to import the curves
for gshp systems in the latest eQUEST version. Maybe someone has
answers?

 

Good luck

Alpana

Dear all,

 

I need to model a ice storage system and a ground souce heat pump system

Does someone has detail information about how to model these two systems

Thank you very much in advance. I really appreciate your help.

John,
 
eQuest underestimating airflows?  I suppose the next thing you're going
to tell us is that the polar ice caps are melting! ;-)  
 
FWIW, I build atriums (i.e. multilevel spaces) a bit differently, see
this post:

They seem to work essentially as expected.
 
Also, I'm not clear on what you mean exactly by 'overcooking'.

the floors and ceilings, and creating airwalls between the atriums
levels.  I have conditioned all bottom atrium floors, conditioned the
2nd floors of the 3 story atriums, but have left the top floors of ALL
atriums unconditioned.
 
My difficulties are twofold:
 
1) This is to be an eventual LEED application, so ASHRAE 90.1-2004 is
the base building. This requires eQuest sized airflows for a 20 Deg
delta T, coil to room temperature.
 
This is resulting in airflows that are 60% down to 30% of what the
Design shows.
 
2) I also seem to undercooking many of the spaces, including the
atriums.
 
Am I modeling these atriums correctly?
 
I don't have much time to make changes, so any help is greatly
appreciated.

John,
 
My thought was that we're not so much cooling and heating the entire
space as treating it as a contiguous entity.  Can anyone outside of
Scott Criswell say with certainty that air floors and air ceilings
permit connected multifloor spaces to behave thermodynamically
equivalent to multilevel spaces?  If so, or Scott if you're out there,
please advise.  Since shells can be placed anywhere, it seems to me
there would have to be sophisticated geometrical checking between spaces
within shells to make it work.
 
Admittedly I'm usually modeling two-level spaces -- gymnasiums
cafeterias etc. so perhaps when I say the method I use produces results
that are within expectations, my expectation bar is set rather low.
 
As for underheating, on several projects I have added baseboards to
eliminate the underheating warnings/errors in the simulation report.
While it get the heating load up in the ballpark of where it needs to
be, its not a perfect solution -- but as you say... deadlines!

That should be "under heating."
 
I have seen your Atrium suggestions before. You seem to be cooling and
heating the entire atrium, which I do not believe is the case,
especially in the 3 story set up.
 
I don't have the time to rebuild my model, sad to say. deadlines..

Kevin:
 
I am getting a bit old and slow, so I don't quite understand your
questions.
 
If you are modeling a new construction rectangle that has both ends (say
top and bottom on a plan view) abutting existing structures, I believe
you can make these walls INTERIOR and ADIABATIC. In that way, you have
no outside influence on the wall, and no heat transfer to another space.
 
You WILL, however, need to make the changes in the .INP text file. You
simply cannot do it in the eQuest overlay.
 
Why do you care about shading from external sources. Just don't put
those sources In !!
 
Or have I missed something?

to existing buildings.  Furthermore, it appears the first floor of the
new construction extends into a renovation of one of the pre-existing

it be better to modeling the existing buildings as well?  The new

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200707311650.AA5012859pd80001464123@gard.com>

Greetings all,

I have a 100% outside air handling unit serving a laboratory facility that I'm modeling in eQuest.  We are looking into using a "heat pipe" for energy recovery.  From the manufacturer, I have obtained a sensible effectiveness and an air pressure drop for the heat pipe.  However, eQuest has two other pieces of information that it is looking for with regard to these heat pipes: "HX Air Film Resist" and "Air Film Resist Exp".  I asked the manufacturer if he knew what these were in regards to and he did not know.  Equest does not provide any default values for these two items.  So, for the time being, I have entered "0" in for both of them.  I read the dictionary help on these two items, but did not fully understand it.

Can anyone help explain the significance of these two items?  In addition, can you also pass along to me some numerical values that I might use?  They do not need to be very exact at this stage in the design.

Thanks,

Sure, pools have been "modeled" in DOE-2.2/eQuest. But: 

 

The evaporation from the pool depends on the temperature and moisture of
air in the pool room which will depend on the operation and setpoints of
any HVAC alternatives. But in DOE-2, no feedback exists. 

 

Furthermore, many of the interesting options for dehumidification
involve system configurations, and perhaps controls, that are not
represented by the program. (Wrap-around heat pipes, etc., check the
descriptions in the catalogs) 

 

For heat recovery in Vermont winters, be sure to turn FROST-CONTROL on
in the HR settings. And hope the program doesn't hang. 

 

I thought someone, in Canada perhaps, had a single-purpose indoor pool
program. Or there's TRNSYS.

Hello All, 

  

Has anyone modeled a pool in eQuest?  I am modeling a space that
contains a 24 X 44 foot pool.  I'm estimating 55 lbs/hr of evaporation
per sf of surface area (for any period of time when the pool is
uncoverd).  At a minimum I need to model space dehumidification and the
energy needed to heat the pool and replacement water.  I checked the
help files and am using a reheat fan system, as suggested. 

  

I can simply input a latent load into the space to simmulate the
humidity, and manually calculate and input an energy load for pool heat,
but I'd like to do better.

The Canadian pool tool referred to (I believe) is Enerpool ? available
at:
http://www.canren.gc.ca/dtt/index.cfm

It models indoor & outdoor pools with / without solar blankets, solar
collectors & auxillary heaters.  It uses TMY weather data (supplied
for some US & Canadian sites depending on which version you download).
Pool area air temperature, humidity and ventilation rate are constant
for all hours of the simulation and there is no accounting of the
energy to condition the pool area air.

For interest the hourly outputs available (is SI) are:

Sure, pools have been "modeled" in DOE-2.2/eQuest. But: 

The evaporation from the pool depends on the temperature and moisture
of air in the pool room which will depend on the operation and
setpoints of any HVAC alternatives. But in DOE-2, no feedback exists. 

Furthermore, many of the interesting options for dehumidification
involve system configurations, and perhaps controls, that are not
represented by the program. (Wrap-around heat pipes, etc., check the
descriptions in the catalogs) 

For heat recovery in Vermont winters, be sure to turn FROST-CONTROL on
in the HR settings. And hope the program doesn't hang. 

I thought someone, in Canada perhaps, had a single-purpose indoor pool
program. Or there's TRNSYS.

Despite the shading issue, couldn't you use the various orientations as
parameter runs, since all of other inputs are likely to be the same?

I would think that for the base building, its ok to do just one (since you
have to run each orientation and average it, and since you discount self
shading). The designed building will self shade though, so you might want to
build that into the study. Might not be that significant though (might not
be worth the effort of modeling all buildings).

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] appartment complex energy model for LEED

This is an apartment building complex with identical buildings in different
orientations. To do energy analysis for LEED in eQUEST does one need to
model the entire complex (all buildings together)? Or can one just model one
of the typical buildings and run that model in the various orientations and
sum up energy use?

Is there a certain requirement for LEED?

Hi,   

 

I am using Equest to answer some SD level design questions about a LEED
building.  I created a simplified model of the proposed development.  I then
saved this model under a new project and file name, and made changes to
create the ASHRAE 90.1 baseline version of this model.  Now, when I run the
baseline model, the Monthly Energy Consumption by Enduse report does not
include electric energy consumption.  I have looked through all of the
electric equipment in the model, and it all seems to be connected to the
single electric meter in the project.  Any ideas what may be causing this?

 

Thanks,

Dear all,

I'm facing some challenges with Ecotect, partly because of my limited
familiarity with the tool. Specifically with a US building in mind, I need
your input on the following:

1. Is it possible to get a Btu number for whole building energy consumption
directly out of the software? (as opposed to the exclusive heating and
cooling Btus output in the thermal analysis tab)
2. Is it possible to associate a utility rate, time of use or linear, and
get a total dollar number for annual utility cost - for instance as required
by ASHRAE energy cost budget/Appendix G?
3. Is it possible to get a number for peak electric demand as opposed to
just peak cooling load?

Thanks,

Has anyone tried using EnergyPlus in a multi-cpu / shared memory system
environment? Most new CPUs are dual core or quad core. So running a
simulation on these computers will only use, at best 50% of the CPU
resources. So this is a great way to speed up the simulation run-time.
 
I'm spec-ing out the requirements to get ESP-r to take advantage of this
since both the Intel and gcc 4.2 compilers support the OpenMP standard,
and was wondering if EnergyPlus already allows for this.

I ran into this once on  lab project in the northwest (mild climate).  Turned out the higher performance glazing was trapping the high internal heat gains. Higher cooling energy and lower heating energy.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] energy consumption of low-E glazing , why the cooling energy increases


What I did is define a new glass type with simplied method in detailed model. Then replace the old glass with the new defined one. Can this do? How to avoid the defauls percolate through the program? I check again and find that there was no wrong with the conduction heat and solar radiation through window .But the load due to occupancy /lighting/euqipment of Glass Type II is higher than Glass Type I . And the cooling energy of Glass type II is a little highter. It make me confused. Why the load due to  due to occupancy /lighting/euqipment  was different when Glass type changed. 
 
And I doubt if the problem has something to do with OA load .

If cooling load is increasing with decreasing SC that would seem to
suggest that your lights are going on for more hours, check your day
lighting settings (if on).  Also, with such high U-factors, the ambient
air ( I am assuming a warm hot climate ) may be also adding to your
cooling load.
 
Try adding some exterior shades and see what happens.

Just a theory, but do you have the daylighting option turned on? If so -
the visible transmittance (I am assuming Glass 2 is darker) will make a
difference. It will increase your lighting load, and in turn your
cooling load.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200707300848.AA4816296pd80001462450@gard.com>

Hello All,

Has anyone modeled a pool in eQuest?  I am modeling a space that contains a
24 X 44 foot pool.  I'm estimating 55 lbs/hr of evaporation per sf of
surface area (for any period of time when the pool is uncoverd).  At a
minimum I need to model space dehumidification and the energy needed to heat
the pool and replacement water.  I checked the help files and am using a
reheat fan system, as suggested.

I can simply input a latent load into the space to simmulate the humidity,
and manually calculate and input an energy load for pool heat, but I'd like
to do better.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200707290052.AA5216984pd80001462081@gard.com>

Dear all

I have tried to compare the energy consumption between two different glass
types and got a curious result. The parameters of these two glasses are
listed below:

1) Coated U=2.5 SC=0.45
2) low-e U=1.76 SC=0.44

I thought the energy consumption of Glass Type II would be lower than that
of Glass Type I . But the result is the cooling energy of Glass Type II is
higher than  that of Glass Type I , and the heating energy lower than that
of Glass Type I.

I have no idea of this. And I checked LS-F/ SS-D / BEPS and found some
points listed below

1) in LS-F annual sensible  cooling load of Glass Type II is lower than that
of Glass Type I , latent cooling load of Glass Type II is higher. The total
annual cooling load of Glass Type II is a little higher

2) in SS-D monthly cooling energy of Glass Type II is  higher

3) dencity and schedule of occupancy /lighting /euqipment are the same in
the two models , but cooling load and heating load due to these indoor
factors are different , why?

4) monthly schedule of occupancy /lighting /euqipment  is all the same
during the year, but cooling load and heating load due to these indoor
factors are different every month, why?

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200707271721.AA2151859pd80001461815@gard.com>

Hello,
 
I'm using BEOpt to model packed earth structures as part of my masters project with walls up to 3' thick.  For walls over 2', I get a DOE 2 error that says the wall is "too thick or too dense" and then the simulation ceases  Is there a way to prevent this from happening?  
 
A compromise I am considering is using a maximum 2' thickness, but increasing the specific heat or density of the material to simulate thicker walls.  Is there a better way?

Thanks,
Jon

I'll also add that when you simulate a building using a California
climate zone, it automatically creates a Design Day report along with
the standard reports.  This is a nice feature that seems to only be
incorporated with the CZ climate zones.

Before equest will use the Design Day information in the schedules you
need
to setup actual design days for the simulation to use.

You need to do this in the detailed edit under the Project & Site tab.
You
need to create both a heating and cooling design day and then input the
desired temperature extremes and duration that you wish to simulate.
Reference the climate design data in the ASHRAE Fundamentals Handbook
for
your location.  Once you create the design days equest will use them for
equipment sizing rather than the peak heating & cooling loads calculated
from the TMY weather data.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Question About Equest - Space Peak Load Calculations

I have a question about how Equest calculates the space peak load
calculation.

For all of my internal heat gains (people, lights, equipment) I have
schedules.  When you create a schedule, it not only asks for utilization
for
Sunday through Saturday, but it also asks for a schedule for Design
Cooling
and schedule for Design Heating.  I assume that the Design Cooling
Schedule/Design Heating Schedule is used by Equest to calculate the peak
cooling and heating load for the space.

For instance, lets say I have a laboratory with 8 watts/square foot of
equipment load.  From an energy standpoint, this equipment load really
never
gets higher than 50% throughout the year.  So I create my Sunday through
Saturday schedules with a peak utilization of 0.5000.  However, there
will
be sometimes where 8 watts/square foot will be generated in the
laboratory,
and I need to size my zone supply airflow for this 8 watts/square foot.
Therefore, I create my design cooling schedule to require a peak
utilization
of 1.000.  However, when I run the simulation and go to the "LS-B Space
Peak
Load Component" report the peak cooling load is using the 50%
diversified
load.  Why is this happening?  Shouldn't Equest be using the Design
Cooling
schedule which has a peak utilization of 1.000 all the time?

Sincerely,

Brandon,
 
I agree that there needs to be better reporting of OA loads in equest.  OA
loads only show up in the system reports so you would have to subtract the
building loads from the load reports to get an approximation of the hourly
OA loads.  Notice I said approximation.  The system reports also include
pipe and duct losses, pump & fan heat and any other system level effects on
your heating/cooling.  The best way I have found to check outside air is to
use the hourly reports.  Remember you can set the hourly report output to a
format that can be easily opened in Excel if you need to do any additional
calculations.

Thanks to all for answers to previous question,
 
Here's one more... I think it has been asked before although I
Google-scanned the archives could not seem to find it.  Namely, where is the
eQuest outside air load reported?  I see lots disclaimers for "The above
loads do not include outside air ventilation loads", but no outside air load
ventilation summary.
 
Do I really have to take a differential between the total load and all other
loads to back-into an outside air load for each space and system? There's
needs to be a better way...!
 
Thanks in advance,

Yes, ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G requires modeling elevator energy as long as it is designed in the project.  You can come up a realistic schedule or stick to a standard schedule in Appendix G if necessary.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Energy use for elevators
 
Dear All,
   
  I have seen some messages these days asking the energy use of elevators. But it seems that there is no very accurate way of modeling annual lift energy use.
   
  If we need to simulate building energy use according to ASHRAE 90.1-2004 for LEED accrediation in e-QUEST, do we need to simulate elevator energy use or not? Is it a must do? Could somebody with experience with this topic give me some hints?
   
  Thanks a lot in advance.
