Hi,

I am working on a project on Mount Rainier with two challenges I could use some advice on. 

1) Does anyone have a lead on TMY data for a 4000 ft plus site in the wet side of the Cascade Range, north of Mt Shasta.  

2) The triple deck multi-zone is not a standard system in DOE2.1e.  Any suggestions on how best to simulate it another way?  

Thanks for any help you can provide

Message-ID: <200012060033.eB60XMd04211@gronk.lbl.gov>


I've checked in a new module HeatRecovery.f90.
Other modules that have changed are:

SimAirServingZones
MixedAir
Humidifiers
SetPointManager
Zoneequipmentmanager

And: Energy+.idd

New inputs are:

TermRhOAHeatRec.idf
TermRhOAHeatRec.rvi

HeatRecovery.f90 contains a model of a flat plate
heat exchanger (from Michael Wetter) with the usual
flow arrangements. The new input illustrates the use of
the heat exchanger to recover heat from the system relief
air. 

Changes I made to SimAirServingZones will cause small changes
to all of the inputs using central air systems.

I would like to learn that is it possible to modify PowerDOE's units to SI units?
Is there anyone tried to use PowerDOE with SI units?
Which method do I have to follow in order to simulate my project with the help of data in SI units? (as you will realize that it is not practical to change all data units one by one.)

Thanks.

Faraj,
    It is certainly possible to do nighttime natural ventilation studies
with TRNSYS. I can answer any specific questions that you might have but the
experts in the field are at Transsolar in Germany (email
trnsys at transsolar.com). The basic method for performing natural ventilation
studies (whether night time or daytime) is to add a special version of the
program COMIS into TRNSYS as a component Type. You can get the COMIS Type
for TRNSYS for free from the website
http://evl.cstb.fr/soft/present.asp?langue=us&m=lpr&context=COMIS. There you
will also find instructions on connecting the two programs and a basic
example to get you started. COMIS calculates the airflow between zones based
on your input data and based on the temperature differences calculated in
Type56 (the multizone building model) and then passes the information back
to TRNSYS where the temperatures are updated based on the airflow
calculations.
Cheers,
    David

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200012072133.AA333625pd80000001135@gard.com>

Good morning

I have a general question about energy code compliance of lighting systems
for New York State, and I'm hoping someone can enlighten me.

Can anyone tell me what person would be responsible for seeing that lighting
systems installed in commercial/industrial buildings meet the State's energy
code?  Out here in California, this would typically be done by the HVAC
contractor or an energy code (Title 24) compliance consultant.  In New York
State, would this function typically be performed by an architect, a
lighting designer, the electrical contractor, the HVAC contractor, a
specialized compliance consultant, or some other person?

Any light you can shed on this issue will be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!

I am modeling a building with gas heating in a packaged VAV rooftop unit.
My model works great for the months when gas is actually used, but I want to
shut the gas off during 7 months of the year.  The problem with just using
the heating schedule is that my zone reheat (electric) are also shut off
which means my energy usage is too little.  Does anyone know how to shut off
the system heat without affecting the zone heat?  I would appreciate any
help.  Thanks.

I am using PowerDOE and hoping to get direction on modeling an

that is not right but perhaps the closest...your input and experience?

Exciting New Student Competition: The Solar Decathlon is an intercollegiate
competition that will challenge architecture and engineering students to
integrate renewable energy and energy efficiency technology with dwelling
design. Students from a variety of academic disciplines will form teams to
design and construct a fully self-sufficient solar-powered house. The Solar
Decathlon will take place on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., in the fall
of 2002. Teams will compete against each other during a week of 10 contests that
test energy production and efficiency as well as design aesthetics and effective
communication. The public and media will be invited to watch the contests and
tour the competition houses. Entries will be selected through a proposal system,
and the deadline for proposals is Feb. 16. If you know of a university or
college faculty that might have a particular interest in this competition, call
Ruby Nahan at 303-384-7401 or Pam Gray-Hann at 303-275-4626. For more

"How Low Can You Go? Case Studies Of Very Low Energy Buildings"
A symposium for ASHRAE's 2002 Winter meeting in Atlantic City, New Jersey.
Recent interest in very low energy commercial buildings begs the question
"How Low Can You Go?". Just how little energy can a commercial office
building use and still satisfy the indoor environmental needs of the
building's occupants?
ASHRAE TC9.6 - Systems' Energy Utilization and TC1.10 - Energy Resources are
looking for well documented examples of ultra-low energy large commercial
buildings. The building's energy use and thermal comfort must be documented
in accordance with applicable ASHRAE standards (105, 55, 62, etc.) and have
at least one years worth of documented performance. The symposium's intent
is to show just how energy efficient a building can be and to demonstrate to
the industry how to get there and what are the costs and benefit of doing
so.
Abstracts are due Feb. 15, 2000. Final versions of accepted papers will be
due May 15, 2001. The symposium is planned for January 12-16, 2002. Send
