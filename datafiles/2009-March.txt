A clarification on the reference to ESP-r several days ago...

ESP-r has included a very efficient mass flow solver within the simulation
engine for over a decade.  For most users the inclusion of a flow network
in a model does not cause much of a slow-down of the assessment
process - perhaps 10-20%.

Of course, some flow networks or flow network control scenarios
work best with short timesteps. It does take longer to run simulations
at a one minute timestep than a 15 minute timestep.

The solver takes directives as to whether the
user wants to ping-pong or use an onion approach.  Those that
take the onion approach notice an increase in the computing
resource, but there seem to be fewer models that require an
onion approach and the efficiency of the solver still applies.

Entities in the mass flow network can also act as boundary nodes for
the in-built transient 3D CFD engine so that changes in weather conditions
or pressures in adjacent rooms are accounted for within the
CFD domain.  The CFD solver typically runs in adaptive mode
(new wall functions are determined at each timestep based on
detected changes in boundary conditions and flow fields).  This allows the
truly passionate to look at changes in rooms over time. Currently, few
people seem to have carried out transient multi-domain assessments
beyond 1000 timsteps.

We know of groups that have also adapted ESP-r to communicate
with external CFD solvers in order to explore the benefits and
drawbacks of communicating with other tools.

In  Europe, natural ventilation studies seem to have been normal
practice for quite a few design teams. There are multiple tools
that address issues related to natural ventilation and thus many
designers can test their ideas out.

On the modeling of natural ventilation, I've not heard of anyone who's
coupled thermal with CFD for annual simulations, and if they did I'd
guess they're still waiting for the results!  There are, however,
several programs (EnergyPlus, ESPr) that do link up with a multi-zone
air-flow network program (EnergyPlus uses AirNET/CONTAM)  to  "ping
pong" with the thermal
program.  My experience doing an earlier linking of COMIS into
EnergyPlus showed increases in runtimes of  2-3 times (that's on top of
the standard run times most people have seen). I also saw instabilities
in the "ping pong" approach that made me think of more iterations
(horrors!), but the funding got cut so I didn't pursue that.

Hi All,

I'm working on building simulation with TRNSYS and VE in France where Equest
and DOE 2 are not used. I have a question about units usable with those tools,
I have quickly tested them and it seems to me them only use imperial metric,
does it exact or some of tolls based on DOE could work with SI units ?

DOE-2.1e and GUI programs that use it allow a user to input metric units directly. DOE-2 will then
convert them to IP units, or vice-versa.

Message-ID: <9ae557f90903020618v1ddeeebfh44b6ea508200c373@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have downloaded an epw weather file and converted to a wea file using
Weather Tool for climate analysis. The weather data source for this Qingdao
weather file is a Chinese Typical Year Weather (CTYW). However, when I
checked with some other sources, it seems that the prevailing wind
directions in winter were very different so I was wondering if there?re any
reliable sources that I can use to cross-check that the wind directions are
accurate because we would like to target strategies to block the wind in
winter time.

Thank you very much in advance.

Sincerely,

It would be common for a "typical" weather file to be created from
actual data chosen by month to be the most average when considering
several variables.  It is possible that the selection process gave
more weight to other weather variables than wind.

When evaluating wind power, you may need weather data that was
prepared for that specific purpose.

Several things to keep in mind about the CTYW weather files:
1. they are based on the International Surface Weather Observations for 
1982 - 1997
2. mostly 3-hour data
3. data from airport (this is no different from  98% of the weather data 
available for use, though). 

Qingdao is a seaport, so the prevailing wind directions may differ 
depending on location to location.  I have created a newer set of 
typical year weather data for China that will become part of ASHRAE's 
IWEC2 weather files for 2,500 international locations. 
I will send you that draft weather file for Qingdao via e-mail.

There are open positions for post doctoral research associates and PhD studentships available at the Departments of Engineering and Architecture on a new Energy Efficient Cities Initiative (EECi) at University of Cambridge. This initiative aims to strengthen the UK's capacity to address energy demand reduction and environmental impact in cities through cross-disciplinary research in building and transport technologies, district power systems, and urban planning. The prospective students will be part of the EECi multidisciplinary team of researchers in developing system-level models for environmental impact assessment and techno-economic feasibility of their individual systems/technologies, which are then integrated into a model of a large urban area.

Leon,

Nice to get this update on CONTAM97R.  However, I'm surprised that the 
solutions
are still "onion" (iterating between thermal and air flow program within 
each time step,
for the benefit of those unfamiliar with the terminology) and 
"ping-pong" (passing boundary
conditions without iteration), and not simultaneous, especially since 
Jim was quite
critical of the ping-pong approach I was proposing for the 
EnergyPlus/COMIS link back
in 2002.  I'd also like to hear more about CONTAM 3.0 with CFD 
capability. Is this intended
for annual simulations, or single snapshots?  Does it also have thermal 
capabilities ?

Dear Dr. Huang:

George didn't have much time on CONTAM97R since then. Simultaneous solution is
possible but needs a little bit more new derivations, which should work better
for highly-coupled thermal-airflow problems without the need of relaxations. 

The CFD in CONTAM 3.0 is relatively faster than normal CFD, which is compiled
together and shares memory with CONTAM, instead of externally coupled. It
currently doesn't do annual simulations and thermal equation coupling but the
turbulence model and the solver algorithm can be improved for annual studies, if
there is really a need to predict annual data using CFD instead of EnergyPlus
etc. By the way, CONTAM 3.0 also provides an option of wind pressure and
contaminant profile predictions on building envelopes using CFD, which is very
useful for multizone indoor simulations.

Best regards,
Leon Wang

Thank you so much for the all the inputs. I think that the reason for the
Qingdao discrepancies could be that it varies with location of monitoring
station. I'll check the closest location to our site.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Chilled Water Loop / Bldg Modeling
Message-ID: <AB62FAE5F84D7443A1A5ADEA00B6D1CF1FBE7004@MAIL3.ad.uams.edu>

I've been tasked with finding a software package that can model our chilled water system.   We have a district plant that distributes chilled water to many buildings on our campus.  My specific task is to model the chilled water system of one specific building, then those results will determine if we continue looking for a different software package, or proceed to model the other buildings.  Pretty much they want a computer model of the buildings chilled water system that can predict the chilled water flow requirements for each AHU & the total building as a function of the buildings chilled water supply temperature, outside air conditions, and air handling unit flow rates.

I'm looking at eQuest & EnergyPlus (as they're the only free options I've found so far to play with), and I'd really like some opinions/suggestions on how to proceed.

Thanks

Jason

Attached are my views on the eQUEST program.  I tried to compare DOE2.1E and eQUEST using a one million square-foot high-rise mixed-use building with about 200 zones and several types of systems.  Most of my eQUEST modeling time was spent in trying to get rid of the eQUEST decisions and assumptions made by the wizards so that it matched the DOE2.1E input (the actual project specifications) at every point.  You have to start with the wizard because the best feature of eQUEST ? creating the building model, floor plans & zones by tracing AutoCAD drawings ? is not available in detailed edit.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Percent Energy Savings
Message-ID: <e1069dd540b2.40b2e1069dd5@iit.edu>

ASHRAE Std90 for the baseline is already stringent and specifies the commonly used systems & plants based on building type and size.  Based on the CCGT building, high percentage energy savings for LEED certification can be achieved with low-rise buildings with a high exposure to floor surface areas to locate PV panels, high but efficient glass to wall area for day-lighting, the use of GSHP (which requires a large site area which may not be available in city blocks), and low common energy consuming systems in baseline and proposed which increases ?percentage? energy savings.  
 
A school building is low-rise, is low in process loads (increases % savings) and is high in occupancy ventilation which allows for air-to-air heat recovery. It operates only during the day increasing the impact of day-lighting. It is closed in summer, reducing the annual cooling load and increases the impact of solar heating during the rest of the year in cold climates.  So it is possible to achieve zero energy usage.  
 
The choices are limited in the case of inner city high-rise buildings.  Today?s high-rise office building design tries to maximize the glass percentage which increases the impact of day-lighting.  The glass could have PV properties with a very small overall efficiency of converting light to 110V electricity.  The ASHRAE Std90 baseline for Systems and Plants for such a building is considered normal design.  UFAD and other options are not typical.  The proposed envelope has to offset the 40% Window-Wall-Ratio specified by ASHRAE.
 
High percent energy savings does not therefore necessarily mean a better or optimized designed building in terms of the client?s interests.  Percent energy savings should therefore not be the criteria for energy efficient building design.  It should be based on Energy Conservation Measures (ECM) used for the given building that are more energy efficient compared to ASHRAE Std90 for the given building type and size which usually results in increased first costs. The ECMs are going to be different for different types of buildings in different locations.  If the ECM used is inappropriate, then the client pays a price for the high percent energy savings.

Dear Jason,
 
Assuming that you've got the campus HVAC wired to a BMS, I'd consider
gathering data and doing a regression analysis using key parameters to
predict energy or load.
 
There are hundreds of variables which affect actual load, including poorly
calibrated sensors, leaking control valves, etc. which are not well
addressed by ANY modeling software.  On the other hand, you already have the
actual usage data and can get concurrent weather data.  even assuming that
you'll spend significant time tuning the regression, I think you'll be MANY
hours ahead and have a more accurate model from which to make improvements.
 
p.s., I'm no stats wizard.  If you aren't either, there are many on a
typical University campus that would probably love a real  problem to
solve....

Jason,
 
Based on your description, I don't think your best option is a
whole-building energy model such as eQuest or EnergyPlus.  I believe your
best option is an empirical model.  I suggest you review the ASHRAE 1050-RP
research, and see if the models presented there might be more applicable to
your task.  They will also be much, much easier to learn and use.  You can
either use the 1050-RP toolkit, or depending on your needs, you might find
it handier to create spreadsheet models.  You can find some good examples of
the use of those approaches in the Texas A&M web library.
 
These approaches are typically described in the context of Measurement and
Verification, but they are applicable to many other energy analyses.

Jason,
 
James Dirkes expressed what I was saying much more clearly.  But we are
saying the same thing.  He is correct in everything he said.  Fortunately,
in most cases, you won't need a stats wizard.  Study the regression
approaches used by Texas A&M and others, and provided in the ASHRAE 1050-RP
toolkit, and you may find your task to be fairly simple.

I agree that whole-building energy models are not the way to go for chilled
water simulation.  ASHRAE Research Project 141 developed a program for
simulating central chilled water systems. The original work was done by the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Dr. James A. Corll converted
this mainframe program for use on PCs. He made extensive modifications to
the program to add features and correct some program bugs. His version,
WTRSYM, was a powerful tool for simulating chilled and hot water systems. 

The program allows you to describe a chilled water piping network including
pipe size, length, and fittings. It models variable and constant speed
pumps, chillers, coils and coil loads, pressure relief valves, check valves,
and control valves including two-way, three-way, and wild coils.

Program output includes an echo of the program input, a summary of control
valve conditions including Cv and flow, a summary of air side and water side
coil conditions, and a list of pressure, flow rate, and temperature at every
node in the system. It also notes the load on each chiller and lists
overloaded coils. 

There are several applications for the program. If the total system capacity
is less than the total of the peak design cooling loads, simulations may be
made to see if system inadequacies occur for different load combinations. A
second design application would model proposed changes or additions to an
existing system.

The program can also simulate problems which occur under certain load
conditions and may indicate the cause or solution of the problem. It may be
used to simulate corrective measures to a problem. The program will also
allow simulating the effects of turning off part of the equipment under part
load conditions for energy conservation.

There are a couple of drawbacks to the program. First, Dr. Corll did not
design much of a user interface. The input actually dates back to the
mainframe roots of the program. The input must be in a column oriented
format similar to punch cards in order to work. Second, it is very easy to
create a Chilled Water network that WTRSYM cannot solve. The program uses an
iterative algorithm that must converge to arrive at an answer. The
combination of these two things make WTRSYM a very difficult program to work
with. It does, however, give you results that make it all worth while. 

I have use WTRSYM on several projects over the last 20 years and have never
been disappointed with the results.  The program can give amazing insight
into a chilled water system, especially one that has been added on to for
the last 20 or 30 years.

lost contact with Dr. Corll several years ago. I am not sure if his program
is still available. Elite Software bought the rights to use his program as
the calculation engine for their HSYM program. Elite Software has added a
Windows user interface, which should be very helpful. It will not help with
the convergence problem. HSYM is available through Elite. If you are
interested, click the Elite Software Logo. Understand that this is a

Hi all,

I have a query regarding the percentage breakdown of types of HVAC systems
used in office buildings. i.e. What percentage of buildings use VAV, dual
duct, radiant systems, NV, etc.

As of yet I have been unable to find any study regarding this, but I'm
hoping that at least one has been done. Up to date statistics for the US or
Europe would be preferred, but if you know of any information (even if it is
outdated), that would be a big help. Likewise, if you know of studies that
are for other types of buildings - labs, schools, hospitals etc. - please
let me know.

Thanks!

Paul,
 
Poke around CBECS, that info might be in there. I know they have heating
and cooling energy source numbers, not sure if delivery devices are in
there somewhere or not. Might need to do some of your own data analysis

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Survey regarding types of HVAC systems used?



Hi all,

I have a query regarding the percentage breakdown of types of HVAC
systems used in office buildings. i.e. What percentage of buildings use
VAV, dual duct, radiant systems, NV, etc.  

As of yet I have been unable to find any study regarding this, but I'm
hoping that at least one has been done. Up to date statistics for the US
or Europe would be preferred, but if you know of any information (even
if it is outdated), that would be a big help. Likewise, if you know of
studies that are for other types of buildings - labs, schools, hospitals
etc. - please let me know.

Thanks!

It depends at how specific you want to get in your HVAC 
categorizations.  The CBECS data base queries all the buildings in
their data base of ~ 6000 commercial buildings ( ~500 office buildings) 
about their main heating and cooling equipment types,
e.g., heat pump, furnace, space heat, district heat, boiler, etc. for 
heating, packaged AC, heat pump, central AC, district cooling,
central chiller, evap cooling, etc., for cooling.  Somewhere it's also 
possible to get the percentages with economizers and VAV systems.

I did a report on this called "Analysis of 1999 CBECS Data by Commercial 
Building Type",  Y.J. Huang, J.A. Roberson, and O. Sezgen,  2005.  It's 
a LBNL report (LBNL-57457)!, but I'm not sure if I ever finalized the 
paperwork on it.  If you have trouble getting a hold of it, let me know 
and I'll see if I can dig up an electronic copy or, barring that, scan 
in the hard copy that's on my bookshelf.

If you look at the the actual survey data files on the CBECS site, it
will list the HVAC type, chiller type etc. and also gives what
percentage of the stock a particular survey data point represents.

Paul, 

  

Poke around CBECS, that info might be in there. I know they have heating
and cooling energy source numbers, not sure if delivery devices are in
there somewhere or not. Might need to do some of your own data analysis
to pull out office spaces.

Hello Paul

 

There is some information available in a presentation on the California CEUS Study done by Martha Brook of the CEC.

 

You can find that here:  http://eber.ed.ornl.gov/tc96/Peeking%20Under%20the%20Hood%20CEUS.ppt

 

But beware!  It is a huge presentation (13Mb!) so you should save it instead of trying to open it : )

Ronan,

keep in mind that CFD software packages that applies k-epsilon
modeling do not do a good job in simulating large scale turbulence.
DNS or at least LES is what you should apply especially for external
and city scale analysis.
I am not updated on the software developments in this field but you
should check that out carefully.

Best regards
Mat

Subject: [Bldg-sim] How to unconditioned a Zone
Message-ID: <552203.97172.qm@web32602.mail.mud.yahoo.com>


Hi all,

Can someone please explain to me how can I unconditioned(non air-conditioned) the core of the office building, 2 storey (available in one of eQUEST default selection)?
I'm exploring the simulation of an office building in which the core of the building is designed to be a huge store room (non-air conditioned) while the perimeter space consists of rooms which are air conditioned.
I tried selecting the core zone and "unconditioned" it in the "Building foorprint-zone characteristics *pg3 of wizard screen*" but the simulation results of the space cooling load is the same as when the whole building is air-conditioned. I expected it to be much less since the core is unconditioned.

Have I done anything wrong? Do appreciate it if someone can enlightened me.   

Thanks a million. 

Warmest Regards,
TC

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Percent Energy Savings
 
ASHRAE Std90 for the baseline is already stringent and specifies the commonly used systems & plants based on building type and size.  Based on the CCGT building, high percentage energy savings for LEED certification can be achieved with low-rise buildings with a high exposure to floor surface areas to locate PV panels, high but efficient glass to wall area for day-lighting, the use of GSHP (which requires a large site area which may not be available in city blocks), and low common energy consuming systems in baseline and proposed which increases ?percentage? energy savings.  
 
A school building is low-rise, is low in process loads (increases % savings) and is high in occupancy ventilation which allows for air-to-air heat recovery. It operates only during the day increasing the impact of day-lighting. It is closed in summer, reducing the annual cooling load and increases the impact of solar heating during the rest of the year in cold climates.  So it is possible to achieve zero energy usage.  
 
The choices are limited in the case of inner city high-rise buildings.  Today?s high-rise office building design tries to maximize the glass percentage which increases the impact of day-lighting.  The glass could have PV properties with a very small overall efficiency of converting light to 110V electricity.  The ASHRAE Std90 baseline for Systems and Plants for such a building is considered normal design.  UFAD and other options are not typical.  The proposed envelope has to offset the 40% Window-Wall-Ratio specified by ASHRAE.  If the office building envelope is used for a hospital or hotel, which operate 8760 hours/year, then the percent energy savings will go down.  
 
High percent energy savings does not therefore necessarily mean a better or optimized designed building in terms of the client?s interests.  Percent energy savings should therefore not be the criteria for energy efficient building design.  It should be based on Energy Conservation Measures (ECM) used for the given building that are more energy efficient compared to ASHRAE Std90 for the given building type and size which usually results in increased first costs. The ECMs are going to be different for different types of buildings in different locations.  If the ECM used is inappropriate, then the client pays a price for the high percent energy savings.

 
In my opinion the way to express energy efficiency would be energy per unit area.  Occupancy per unit area has to be defined for different types of buildings (office, hotel, retail, hospital, etc.) and energy efficiency should also take into account location based on HDD & CDD.  Energy per Person will account for overall energy efficiency of buildings & transportation when designing sustainable townships.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] High hours outside throttling range
Message-ID: <5F662BF0C1928242BF324F3EE6C27D14580777@exc01sfo1us.FKUSA.ORG>

To All,
 
I've got a high number of hours outside throttling range for a 27-story building in India (40% of hours).  It is a VAV with electric reheat.  Upon inputting 40,000 cfm per floor (25,000 sf), I get down to about 3% of hours outside throttling range.  However, Trace only calls for about 20,000 cfm per floor.  I double checked all my load inputs across both programs and it seems like occupancy, lights and equipment loads match up.  
 
I noticed that most of my unmet cooling load hours occur in my internal zones.  So I input a system total supply volume of 25,000 cfm per floor and also allocated 16,000 cfm to the internal zones. This decreased the number of hours outside throttling range to about 4%.
 
My question is, am I allowed to "allocate" cfm to the internal zones like that?
 
Thanks very much in advance!
Linda

I don't know how it works in eQuest, but in DOE-2.1E, you can input any 
ASSIGNED-CFM to any conditioned zone.

in showing/taking the most effective steps to decrease energy usage which
should be the objective, regardless of percentage.  Percent savings is
always very very subject to manipulation.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Percent Energy Savings

 

ASHRAE Std90 for the baseline is already stringent and specifies the
commonly used systems & plants based on building type and size.  Based on
the CCGT building, high percentage energy savings for LEED certification can
be achieved with low-rise buildings with a high exposure to floor surface
areas to locate PV panels, high but efficient glass to wall area for
day-lighting, the use of GSHP (which requires a large site area which may
not be available in city blocks), and low common energy consuming systems in
baseline and proposed which increases "percentage" energy savings.  

 

A school building is low-rise, is low in process loads (increases % savings)
and is high in occupancy ventilation which allows for air-to-air heat
recovery. It operates only during the day increasing the impact of
day-lighting. It is closed in summer, reducing the annual cooling load and
increases the impact of solar heating during the rest of the year in cold
climates.  So it is possible to achieve zero energy usage.  

 

The choices are limited in the case of inner city high-rise buildings.
Today's high-rise office building design tries to maximize the glass
percentage which increases the impact of day-lighting.  The glass could have
PV properties with a very small overall efficiency of converting light to
110V electricity.  The ASHRAE Std90 baseline for Systems and Plants for such
a building is considered normal design.  UFAD and other options are not
typical.  The proposed envelope has to offset the 40% Window-Wall-Ratio
specified by ASHRAE.  If the office building envelope is used for a hospital
or hotel, which operate 8760 hours/year, then the percent energy savings
will go down.  

 

High percent energy savings does not therefore necessarily mean a better or
optimized designed building in terms of the client's interests.  Percent
energy savings should therefore not be the criteria for energy efficient
building design.  It should be based on Energy Conservation Measures (ECM)
used for the given building that are more energy efficient compared to
ASHRAE Std90 for the given building type and size which usually results in
increased first costs. The ECMs are going to be different for different
types of buildings in different locations.  If the ECM used is
inappropriate, then the client pays a price for the high percent energy
savings.

 

In my opinion the way to express energy efficiency would be energy per unit
area.  Occupancy per unit area has to be defined for different types of
buildings (office, hotel, retail, hospital, etc.) and energy efficiency
should also take into account location based on HDD & CDD.  Energy per
Person will account for overall energy efficiency of buildings &
transportation when designing sustainable townships.

I think that this issue has been brought up before, but in some cases, energy comparisons to ASHRAE 90.1 should also be looked at closely.  In particular, for a ground source heat pump, or any heat pump with electricity as its heating source, the ASHRAE baseline system calls for electric resistance heat.  This automatically makes the heat pump more attractive than it would, say, against a VAV system with hydronic heat and a high efficiency boiler, at least in terms of ASHRAE 90.1.  The heat pump will get you more LEED points, but will not necessarily be the most energy efficient system for your customer.

Today marks the tenth anniversary of the BLDG-SIM mailing 
list. It has grown and matured from my crazy idea into a 
well respected forum. I believe it has maintained a high 
level of quality and has helped many, many people.

For all those that have taken the time to answer the 
questions posted by others, I want to express my deep 
gratitude. I'm especially thankful for those individuals 
that have each answered dozens of questions, your efforts 
have not gone unnoticed.

To help commemorate this anniversary, I encourage everyone 
to help others by sharing their knowledge and wisdom about 
building energy simulation. The next time you see a question 
and you know the answer, go ahead and post.

Thanks again for everyone's effort over the past decade.

Indeed, varaible reference comparison methodologies (each building is 
compared with a different reference and judged by its relative 
performace compared with this variable reference) are far from an 
objectives oriented methodology, and can easily introduce distorsions 
when applied (like better qualifying solutions consuming more energy 
than other solutions with worse qualification). They are 'easy' to 
implement but not that useful to achieve quantified objectives in 
reducing building energy consumption. On the other hand, fixed reference 
comparison methodologies (where the building performance is compared 
with an absolute indicator like kWh/m2-y or emissions) are a bit more 
hard to implement since an apropriate scale for the abolute indicator 
has to be choosen to properly represent each use cathegory of the 
current building stock, but then ara completly oriented to objectives. 
In the US you already have mechanisms to stablish the apprpriate scales 
for the absolute indicator (e.i. Energy Star), and therefore it seems a 
pity that Std. 90.1 and LEED rely on variable reference comparison 
methodologies.

Of course this gets into the whole debate about the absolute accuracy of
energy modeling. Appendix G makes it clear that it does not predict actual
energy usage, which is what you would be trying to compare to if you use
energy use intensities (ie- kbtu/sf/yr). It is much more difficult and
intensive to set up an energy model intending to show you are better than
a real-world EUI value rather than trying to be X% better than ASHRAE
baseline. 

 

At this point, given the pressure to make energy modeling more affordable
(not to spend many extra hours trying to nail down absolutes), it seems
reasonable to me to use the percent better methodology. 

 

Of course we all look forward to the day when we have cheap, easy to use
tools that can actually predict total building energy consumption, but I'm
not holding my breath.

The highlighted yellow and that entire paragraph nail it for me.  It
results in showing/taking the most effective steps to decrease energy
usage which should be the objective, regardless of percentage.  Percent
savings is always very very subject to manipulation.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Percent Energy Savings

 

ASHRAE Std90 for the baseline is already stringent and specifies the
commonly used systems & plants based on building type and size.  Based on
the CCGT building, high percentage energy savings for LEED certification
can be achieved with low-rise buildings with a high exposure to floor
surface areas to locate PV panels, high but efficient glass to wall area
for day-lighting, the use of GSHP (which requires a large site area which
may not be available in city blocks), and low common energy consuming
systems in baseline and proposed which increases "percentage" energy
savings.  

 

A school building is low-rise, is low in process loads (increases %
savings) and is high in occupancy ventilation which allows for air-to-air
heat recovery. It operates only during the day increasing the impact of
day-lighting. It is closed in summer, reducing the annual cooling load and
increases the impact of solar heating during the rest of the year in cold
climates.  So it is possible to achieve zero energy usage.  

 

The choices are limited in the case of inner city high-rise buildings.
Today's high-rise office building design tries to maximize the glass
percentage which increases the impact of day-lighting.  The glass could
have PV properties with a very small overall efficiency of converting
light to 110V electricity.  The ASHRAE Std90 baseline for Systems and
Plants for such a building is considered normal design.  UFAD and other
options are not typical.  The proposed envelope has to offset the 40%
Window-Wall-Ratio specified by ASHRAE.  If the office building envelope is
used for a hospital or hotel, which operate 8760 hours/year, then the
percent energy savings will go down.  

 

High percent energy savings does not therefore necessarily mean a better
or optimized designed building in terms of the client's interests.
Percent energy savings should therefore not be the criteria for energy
efficient building design.  It should be based on Energy Conservation
Measures (ECM) used for the given building that are more energy efficient
compared to ASHRAE Std90 for the given building type and size which
usually results in increased first costs. The ECMs are going to be
different for different types of buildings in different locations.  If the
ECM used is inappropriate, then the client pays a price for the high
percent energy savings.

 

In my opinion the way to express energy efficiency would be energy per
unit area.  Occupancy per unit area has to be defined for different types
of buildings (office, hotel, retail, hospital, etc.) and energy efficiency
should also take into account location based on HDD & CDD.  Energy per
Person will account for overall energy efficiency of buildings &
transportation when designing sustainable townships.

Hi, 
I am trying to use daily or weekly weather data to generate weather files for energy simulation.  For example, I have one-day hourly data from the weather station (like dry dulb temperature, RH, global solar radiation, wind velocity and direction etc.), and want to develop those data to a monthly data set. 

I wonder whether there are some software which can do this work? I have tried Meteonorm 5.1 and found that it can only develop the monthly data to annual data set.

Any comments or suggestions are highly appreciated. Thanks!

Dear colleagues,

 

It is my pleasure to announce that we will be hosting this year's
International Radiance Workshop on October 22/23 at the Harvard Graduate
School of Design. The school is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
which is part of the Boston Metropolitan Area. Logan Airport is the
closest international airport. The International Radiance Workshops are
annual gatherings of developers and users of the Radiance backward
raytracer. The workshop consists of a series of presentations that in
the past included case studies on the use of Radiance in lighting and/or
daylighting projects, recent advanced in glare detection, visual comfort
and energy savings from lighting controls as well as the use of Radiance
in Art and Design. At least one session is typically also dedicated to
technical advances that have been made within the Radiance engine over
the past year. Presentations from previous workshops can be downloaded
from http://www.radiance-online.org/. 

 

We are planning to split the workshop into an 'application day'
(Thursday) and a more 'technical day' (Friday). Workshop fees have not
been determined, yet, but should be within the $250 to $300 range. We
will offer a reduced student registration fee. I will soon send out
another email with registration details and a call for presentations.
For now, mark your calendars! 

 

I look forward to welcoming you in Cambridge,

Hello All,
?
I am modeling a Heat pump system with an air cooled condenser. I have two questions about the outside fan power. 
1. 
The unit of OUTSIDE-FAN-ELEC?is W/Btu. The outside fan mode is intermittent. If I know the cooIing capacity (Btuh not Btu),?outside fan?cfm and?kw at full load,?could anyone explain me how?to calculate the outside fan?electric? 
?
2.
The minimum unload ratio and min hot gas bypass ratio are 0.15. When Cooling PLR is?below than?0.15, how is the outside fan power calculated? I exported the hourly report and found it doesn't have the linear relationship with the compressor runtime.
?
Thanks a lot for your help

Message-ID: <fc5cfcb40903050849k371d19b1t34ae0b539ebc27ff@mail.gmail.com>

I have a question regarding the capabilities of IES VE and its CFD package
and I was hoping someone might have some experience or insight to help get
me started on the following problem.  We have a concept cooling design which
includes a radiant hollow core concrete ceiling through which evaporatively
cooled air is routed.  The air which is routed through the radiant ceiling
comes from a central evaporative cooler and is then exhausted at the
exterior of each room after it has passed through the airflow passages in
the ceiling.  Just to be clear, this is not a typical radiant system in that
electricity is being used to cool the slab but instead evaporatively cooled
outdoor air is being used in its place.  We also want to couple these
effects with natural ventilation which occurs because of the use of operable
windows.

We are trying to analyze the effects of these techniques in a cooling season
in Colorado (hence the benefit of the evaporative cooler).  We have
conducted rough calculations of the benefits of using such a system using
standard ASHRAE energy transfer techniques and we want to verify our
results.  Have you ever heard of this type of system being modeled in IES VE
and/or is it capable of modeling such a system?  Is there a way to modify
the "radiant ceiling" option in IES to take into account the saving which
would occur by using evaporatively cooled air in the place of electricity?
If not, is there a way to manually create such a system from the ground up?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.

Hi all,

 

I am currently carrying out the energy modelling for LEED, and I need to
model a packaged rooftop air conditioner (system 4) for some zones of the
baseline building.

For the cooling part, I understand I should be using an EER of 9.7 and that
it should vary, along with the unit capacity, according to the defaults
DOE-2 curves. My question is: does this include fan energy, or does it come
on top of that?

And if it does come on top, should the fan energy be modelled as constant
volume, cycling on and off, and with its power calculated as indicated in
90.1?s appendix G?

Mathieu

Hi Rebecca,

 

What I would is utilise IESs' good capability in modelling building
physics. The hollow concrete slab could be modelled as a narrow,
concrete "plenum" above the zone to be conditioned via the cooled slab.
This "plenum" zone could then be supplied with the evaporatively cooled
air at estimated rate. 

I would not go down the path of chilled beams as they are difficult to
control and esp difficult to monitor in the Vista. Also concrete is not
amongst the material types for chilled ceiling. The heat transfer rate
could get exaggerated with other material types. 

 

Hope this helps.

 

Minu

Zhoulun,

Are you wanting to take one day's hourly data and then repeat them to
create an artificial month of data ? Most simulation programs have
weather utility programs that will take your data and convert it to the
format required
by their program.The trickiest part of the problem is that you rarely
have all the right parameters for the data,
and need to do psychrometric conversions to wet bulb, absolute humidity,
etc., so it's best to let these utility
programs figure them out. DOE-2 accepts only full year weather files. I
believe EnergyPlus will accept partial
year data.

Rebecca and others, 

 

Modeling air-cooled (or heated), hollow-core radiant slabs (such as TermoDeck) within IES Virtual Environment is a relatively straightforward matter:

 

1) Include the hollow-core geometry in your model. This must be segmented to properly capture the changing delta-T over distance as the supply air gains heat while passing through any sections of the floor cavity that are going to be in series rather than parallel configurations. 

 

2) If the hollow core is cooled via natural ventilation, then the volume of the core spaces needs to be coupled to the plenums or zones that include the operable openings. Like windows or other operable openings in the occupied spaces, these openings can be controlled via schedules, interior conditions, climate variables, or formulae including any of these. The coupled MacroFlo dynamic bulk airflow modler within the VE will need to run whenever natural ventialtion is to be acconted for, but not if there were no operable windows and the hollow-coore was to be cooled by mechanically driven supply airflow. 

 

In the case of natural ventialtion, you may also wish to use the MicroFlo CFD tool within the VE to determine the performacne of specific openings, cavities, or occupied spaces under specific conditons. The bulk airflow model and thermal simulation are used to set up initial boundary conditions for the CFD model, and then the results from the CFD run can then inform revision of the operable openings in the dynamic bulk-airflow + thermal modeling. While the CFD work can be valuable in determining performance and refining the model, it is not required to run the dynamic bulk-airflow + thermal modeling of the naturally ventilated spaces, nor is it required for modeling the hollow-core floor.

 

3) Apply convective heat transfer coefficients to the interior surfaces of the hollow-core material constructions appropriate to the use of this core space as a duct (see ASHRAE Fundamentals for determining appropriate coefficients). You will need to calculate the equivalent air-film resistance, as this is the value you will change, replacing the air-film resistance associated with the default variable coefficient for natural convection in the Constructions dialog. Then open the Derived Parameters dialog from there to confirm that the convective heat transfer coefficient calculated by the VE is what you intended (and thus that you have entered the correct air-film resistance value). Note also that the bottom surface construction of the hollow-core ceiling will be applied as the Ceiling construction for the occupied space below, and therefore the "Outside" surface air-film resistance for this element will be the one facing the interior of the hollow core.

 

4) If air-cooling or heating of the hollow core is mechanically driven, set up the system in ApacheHVAC with the supply air running through the hollow core geometry as would be done in the actual building. If it is a mixed-mode system, wherein the cavity is alternately cooled by mechanical supply air and natural ventilation, then set up the controls such that these modes hand-off appropriately-i.e., if no overlap is desired, ensure that controllers for both system include common sensed variable and thresholds, and non-overlapping responses at these thresholds.

 

IES VE is in fact exceptionally well suited to doing this and provides appropriate means of controlling such systems and of accounting for the full range of radiant and convective heat transfer paths involved. 

 

As with any tool, taking the time to first understand how to use the tool properly is important to getting appropriate results.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] IES VE: Radiant, hollow core ceiling

 

I have a question regarding the capabilities of IES VE and its CFD package and I was hoping someone might have some experience or insight to help get me started on the following problem.  We have a concept cooling design which includes a radiant hollow core concrete ceiling through which evaporatively cooled air is routed.  The air which is routed through the radiant ceiling comes from a central evaporative cooler and is then exhausted at the exterior of each room after it has passed through the airflow passages in the ceiling.  Just to be clear, this is not a typical radiant system in that electricity is being used to cool the slab but instead evaporatively cooled outdoor air is being used in its place.  We also want to couple these effects with natural ventilation which occurs because of the use of operable windows.  

We are trying to analyze the effects of these techniques in a cooling season in Colorado (hence the benefit of the evaporative cooler).  We have conducted rough calculations of the benefits of using such a system using standard ASHRAE energy transfer techniques and we want to verify our results.  Have you ever heard of this type of system being modeled in IES VE and/or is it capable of modeling such a system?  Is there a way to modify the "radiant ceiling" option in IES to take into account the saving which would occur by using evaporatively cooled air in the place of electricity?  If not, is there a way to manually create such a system from the ground up?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.

Rebecca,
 
Regarding your particular evaporatively cooled hollow-core system in a mixed-mode building:
 
As you are not planning to naturally ventilate the hollow core itself, you will need to use MacroFlo (the dynamically coupled bulk airflow modeling application within the VE) a bit differently than I had described in my more general email on the topic. Rather than coupling operable opening to the hollow core, you will need to use MacroFlo to model the dynamic performance of the space associated with the operable windows in the building, any controls interlocks you may be planning, and to look at the building performance if these were to overlap (i.e., if there are no control interlocks).
 
While you may find the MicroFlo CFD module useful for looking at the potential for natural ventilation under specific conditions, it is the MacroFlo dynamic bulk airflow modeler you will need to use to control and assess the role of natural ventilation within the dynamic thermal simulations.
 
As you are planning to couple the floor cavities to a fan-driven mechanical HVAC system using evaporative cooling, you will need to set up this system in ApacheHVAC. If indirect-evap, you will use spray chamber upstream on the exhaust side of a heat exchanger. If direct evap, just the spray chamber. Obviously you can also use both of these. Indeed, the air-handler can be configured however you wish, including IDDE + DX dehum + Desiccant wheel regenerated by the condenser for the DX, or other unconventional configuration. 
 
The VE is very well suited to modeling mixed-mode systems, evaporative cooling, and the radiant heat transfer that are involved in what you are looking at.

Subject: RE: [Bldg-sim] IES VE: Radiant, hollow core ceiling


Rebecca and others, 

 

Modeling air-cooled (or heated), hollow-core radiant slabs (such as TermoDeck) within IES Virtual Environment is a relatively straightforward matter:

 

1) Include the hollow-core geometry in your model. This must be segmented to properly capture the changing delta-T over distance as the supply air gains heat while passing through any sections of the floor cavity that are going to be in series rather than parallel configurations. 

 

2) If the hollow core is cooled via natural ventilation, then the volume of the core spaces needs to be coupled to the plenums or zones that include the operable openings. Like windows or other operable openings in the occupied spaces, these openings can be controlled via schedules, interior conditions, climate variables, or formulae including any of these. The coupled MacroFlo dynamic bulk airflow modeler within the VE will need to run whenever natural ventilation is to be accounted for, but not if there were no operable windows and the hollow-core was to be cooled by mechanically driven supply airflow. 

 

In the case of natural ventilation, you may also wish to use the MicroFlo CFD tool within the VE to determine the performance of specific openings, cavities, or occupied spaces under specific conditions. The bulk airflow model and thermal simulation are used to set up initial boundary conditions for the CFD model, and then the results from the CFD run can then inform revision of the operable openings in the dynamic bulk-airflow + thermal modeling. While the CFD work can be valuable in determining performance and refining the model, it is not required to run the dynamic bulk-airflow + thermal modeling of the naturally ventilated spaces, nor is it required for modeling the hollow-core floor.

 

3) Apply convective heat transfer coefficients to the interior surfaces of the hollow-core material constructions appropriate to the use of this core space as a duct (see ASHRAE Fundamentals for determining appropriate coefficients). You will need to calculate the equivalent air-film resistance, as this is the value you will change, replacing the air-film resistance associated with the default variable coefficient for natural convection in the Constructions dialog. Then open the Derived Parameters dialog from there to confirm that the convective heat transfer coefficient calculated by the VE is what you intended (and thus that you have entered the correct air-film resistance value). Note also that the bottom surface construction of the hollow-core ceiling will be applied as the Ceiling construction for the occupied space below, and therefore the "Outside" surface air-film resistance for this element will be the one facing the interior of the hollow core.

 

4) If air-cooling or heating of the hollow core is mechanically driven, set up the system in ApacheHVAC with the supply air running through the hollow core geometry as would be done in the actual building. If it is a mixed-mode system, wherein the cavity is alternately cooled by mechanical supply air and natural ventilation, then set up the controls such that these modes hand-off appropriately-i.e., if no overlap is desired, ensure that controllers for both system include common sensed variable and thresholds, and non-overlapping responses at these thresholds.

 

IES VE is in fact exceptionally well suited to doing this and provides appropriate means of controlling such systems and of accounting for the full range of radiant and convective heat transfer paths involved.

I do not think that the 'modelling accuracy' argument supports the 
variable reference comparison methodologies (VRCM: percent better 
methodology) in front of the fixed reference comparison methodologies 
(FRCM: EUI as kbtu/sf/yr). The building simulation tools we have 
available nowadays are good enough to benchmark our buiding against a 
standar use (schedules, TMY,...) as it is done with other equipments 
(indeed calibrating the model with an existing building requieres more 
dedication, but this is not the object of a FRCM). Of course they still 
have innacuracies (some more than others), but these ones reflect as 
well into an absolute indicator (FRCM) as into a relative indicator 
(VRCM). In fact often the more energy conscious strategies, design 
features or equipments are the ones that scape from the possibilities of 
our modelling tools, and therefore, with a VRCM you do not cancel those 
inaccuracies between numerator and denominator.
On the other hand, with the VRCM you leave out of the score given to 
your building important design parameters (like compacity) by canceling 
them between baseline and proposed building, which can lead to the 
senseless (from my point of view) situaton that a design option for a 
building with higher EUI gets more LEED EAcr1 points than another design 
option with less EUI. The reference HVAC you assign for each case can 
also introduce distorssions as pointed out in former mails.
Thats why I think that nowadays, when we are strugling to bring the 
building sector (with its huge inertias to change) towards a 
sustainability path with a time urgency (transiton finished in 2050 
worlwide?), we can not afford to use indicators which are not oriented 
directly towards this objective (like VRCM). If building simulation can 
not contribute now (with its available capabilities) to this transition 
(and I believe this strongly depends on adopting FRCM), then I am afraid 
it will just have failed.

Timothy,
 
Thanks for the great summary.  Do you know if it's possible to model
Thermodeck in eQuest by tricking the system somehow?  I've bumped up the
thermal mass of the floors, but it's obviously not having as big an
impact as correctly modelling the CFD component.  I had a thought about
modelling a pre-coil to simulate the damping effects of the slab in
reducing peaks and then manually removing that energy, but I'm not sure
if this is correct.  Any thoughts?
 
Cheers,

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] IES VE: Radiant, hollow core ceiling


Rebecca and others, 

 

Modeling air-cooled (or heated), hollow-core radiant slabs (such as
TermoDeck) within IES Virtual Environment is a relatively
straightforward matter:

 

1) Include the hollow-core geometry in your model. This must be
segmented to properly capture the changing delta-T over distance as the
supply air gains heat while passing through any sections of the floor
cavity that are going to be in series rather than parallel
configurations. 

 

2) If the hollow core is cooled via natural ventilation, then the volume
of the core spaces needs to be coupled to the plenums or zones that
include the operable openings. Like windows or other operable openings
in the occupied spaces, these openings can be controlled via schedules,
interior conditions, climate variables, or formulae including any of
these. The coupled MacroFlo dynamic bulk airflow modler within the VE
will need to run whenever natural ventialtion is to be acconted for, but
not if there were no operable windows and the hollow-coore was to be
cooled by mechanically driven supply airflow. 

 

In the case of natural ventialtion, you may also wish to use the
MicroFlo CFD tool within the VE to determine the performacne of specific
openings, cavities, or occupied spaces under specific conditons. The
bulk airflow model and thermal simulation are used to set up initial
boundary conditions for the CFD model, and then the results from the CFD
run can then inform revision of the operable openings in the dynamic
bulk-airflow + thermal modeling. While the CFD work can be valuable in
determining performance and refining the model, it is not required to
run the dynamic bulk-airflow + thermal modeling of the naturally
ventilated spaces, nor is it required for modeling the hollow-core
floor.

 

3) Apply convective heat transfer coefficients to the interior surfaces
of the hollow-core material constructions appropriate to the use of this
core space as a duct (see ASHRAE Fundamentals for determining
appropriate coefficients). You will need to calculate the equivalent
air-film resistance, as this is the value you will change, replacing the
air-film resistance associated with the default variable coefficient for
natural convection in the Constructions dialog. Then open the Derived
Parameters dialog from there to confirm that the convective heat
transfer coefficient calculated by the VE is what you intended (and thus
that you have entered the correct air-film resistance value). Note also
that the bottom surface construction of the hollow-core ceiling will be
applied as the Ceiling construction for the occupied space below, and
therefore the "Outside" surface air-film resistance for this element
will be the one facing the interior of the hollow core.

 

4) If air-cooling or heating of the hollow core is mechanically driven,
set up the system in ApacheHVAC with the supply air running through the
hollow core geometry as would be done in the actual building. If it is a
mixed-mode system, wherein the cavity is alternately cooled by
mechanical supply air and natural ventilation, then set up the controls
such that these modes hand-off appropriately-i.e., if no overlap is
desired, ensure that controllers for both system include common sensed
variable and thresholds, and non-overlapping responses at these
thresholds.

 

IES VE is in fact exceptionally well suited to doing this and provides
appropriate means of controlling such systems and of accounting for the
full range of radiant and convective heat transfer paths involved. 

 

As with any tool, taking the time to first understand how to use the
tool properly is important to getting appropriate results.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] IES VE: Radiant, hollow core ceiling

 

I have a question regarding the capabilities of IES VE and its CFD
package and I was hoping someone might have some experience or insight
to help get me started on the following problem.  We have a concept
cooling design which includes a radiant hollow core concrete ceiling
through which evaporatively cooled air is routed.  The air which is
routed through the radiant ceiling comes from a central evaporative
cooler and is then exhausted at the exterior of each room after it has
passed through the airflow passages in the ceiling.  Just to be clear,
this is not a typical radiant system in that electricity is being used
to cool the slab but instead evaporatively cooled outdoor air is being
used in its place.  We also want to couple these effects with natural
ventilation which occurs because of the use of operable windows.  

We are trying to analyze the effects of these techniques in a cooling
season in Colorado (hence the benefit of the evaporative cooler).  We
have conducted rough calculations of the benefits of using such a system
using standard ASHRAE energy transfer techniques and we want to verify
our results.  Have you ever heard of this type of system being modeled
in IES VE and/or is it capable of modeling such a system?  Is there a
way to modify the "radiant ceiling" option in IES to take into account
the saving which would occur by using evaporatively cooled air in the
place of electricity?  If not, is there a way to manually create such a
system from the ground up?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.

Hello Zhuolun Chen,

I am not sure if it will exactly serve your purpose, but there a weather generating component within TRNSYS (Type 54). It generates hourly values?of dry dulb temperature, humidity ratio, solar radiation, and wind velocity from the montly data.

Hi, 
I am trying to use daily or weekly weather data to generate weather files for energy simulation.? For example, I have one-day hourly data from the weather station (like dry dulb temperature, RH, global solar radiation, wind velocity and direction etc.), and want to develop those data to a monthly data set. 

I wonder whether there are some software which can do this work? I have tried Meteonorm 5.1 and found that it can only develop the monthly data to annual data set.

Any comments or suggestions are highly appreciated. Thanks!

Best wishes,

Message-ID: <49B10029.2D7D.00A5.0@aeieng.com>

Hi there -

Does anybody know how to make my expression work?

Problem:
I am trying to use two different chilled water loops per year. First is a regular "Chilled Water Loop" in service for summer and the second is a "Free Cooling Loop" in service for only winter time. Fan Coils connected to these loops are serving zones with high load density (e.g. Server, Electrical, etc.). Therefore I'd like to make an expression to be able to switch between those two loops in "HVAC System parameters/CHW Loop" based on outside drybulb temperature. I have found the variable (GLOBAL variable, variable in fortran is DBT) I have to call - just do not now how...

My expression:
if (#G("DBT") < 55)
   then "Free Cooling Loop"
   else "Chilled Water Loop"
endif

Thanks...
Norbert

Mark,

DAYSIM tutorial has information on how it can utilize a SketchUp model for
daylight analysis.

I don't think the choice of materials that can be assigned from within
SketchUp is that comprehensive yet. I haven't tried that route in a while so
unless it can already be done, I'd be interested in hearing from Christoph,
the author of DAYSIM, on when we'll be able to assign user created materials
to surfaces within SketchUp before exporting to DAYSIM.

Hi Mark, 

 

You could use the IES VE plugin for Sketchup Pro which will allow you to
bring your model into the <Virtual Environment> and use modules like
FlucsDL or Radiance to help you optimise your building for daylighting
and glare control.  Please go to www.iesve.com for more details or call
the office at 1 617 426 1890. 

 

Regards

 

Pete Murray

If you have 3DS max, you could export a sketchup file to it. Max now has
a daylight simulation engine similar to Daysim (in fact I think
Christoph Reinhart was involved with its development)

Paper No 371: Passive and Low Energy Architecture (PLEA)  VS Green Architecture (LEED) (3498KB)
Dear Varkie,
 I fully agree with:
(2) a combination of situations, building types, locations and rules with one bottom-line numerical result.
and this is what we implement in our Energy Building Code.
I was always against the ASHRAE approach that agrees to keep all Architectural parameters even if they are wrong. This means that if the building envelop is crazily ZIGZAG, the reference building can be as ZIGZAG as well. I believe that the best energy performance should start with the Architecture of the building and its envelope and not only by the U value of it, or its mechanical equipment. We presented the influence of the Geometrical design parameters of the building, on its energy performance, a long time ago in: 
           Shaviv E. & I. G. Capeluto, 1992. ?The Relative Importance of Various Geometrical Design Parameters in Hot-Humid Climate?. "ASHRAE Trans.", V. AN-92-1. Atlanta . (pp 589-605).
Also. when I participated in the ENERGY ? TUBUC project, I have already presented this idea there. See the attached file on page 58.
 So, this is the approach we have adopted in our energy performance approach of our Energy Building Code. However, the problem is how to define the rules, so that the one bottom-line numerical number, to be compared with, will be sensitive enough and enhance good bio-climatic architecture and energy savings. Only last week we had found the rules how to define this reference building.
I am sorry that we will not be able to present our ideas in the coming IBPSA, as we did not write the paper yet, but I still think that I will come to IBPSA in Glasgow .
 You may circulate my email to the bldg-sim group, if you think it might be of interest to them.
Sincerely yours, 
Edna Shaviv

Subject: Percent Energy Savings
 Edna,
I was thinking of visiting Glasgow during the IBPSA meeting in July.  It was 40 years ago in May 1969 that I obtained my Ph.D. from Strathclyde in Glasgow.
I learnt more about LEED by reading your paper.  I have highlighted some of the points you made.  My interest is mainly E&A which includes the building envelope.  The Bldg-Sim message below defines the dilemma -  (1) one rule to measure building energy efficiency OR (2) a combination of situations, building types, locations and rules with one bottom-line numerical result.  I think the latter would be the fair solution to optimize building design and it would also be in the best interest of the environment and society.  The formula can part of the energy analysis program.

?I do not think that the 'modelling accuracy' argument supports the Variable Reference Comparison Methodologies (VRCM: percent better methodology) in front of the Fixed Reference Comparison Methodologies (FRCM: EUI as kbtu/sf/yr).?

 
Architects today try to maximize the percent glass of the envelope.  This creates a better living environment and increases the productivity of its occupants which also saves energy.  The first costs, construction costs and operating costs of glass high-rise buildings are low.  The construction time is short ? I watched the 92 above grade floors of the Trump Tower in Chicago being completed in less than two years.  Glass buildings are lighter and therefore today?s choice for all types of high-rise buildings ? residential and commercial.
The main source of energy savings of a glass building is day-lighting.  The vertical glass could have PV properties with a small overall efficiency of converting light to 110V electricity.  Both energy savings features require day-light.  8,760 hours per year of building usage is more efficient use of the building but the percent energy savings of this building is going to be less compared to an office building that operates during the day only and with the same envelope.  
Because ASHRAE Std 90 suggests a perimeter zone depth of 15 feet for HVAC, it also means that you cannot get the maximum day-lighting credit for buildings that are 90% glass and with high ceilings.  These glass buildings are not going to meet Std90 envelope requirements.  1 watt/sf lighting is very stringent for an office building and so also are the mechanical systems standards.  It is not practical to achieve LEED Silver with percent energy savings for high-rise buildings in urban locations, particularly with buildings that operate 8760 hours per year.
50 years ago the average US family of 6 lived in a 2,000 sf house, close to their place of work and used public transportation.  Today the family size is 4, the house size is 4000 sf, they live 30 miles away in the suburbs, both adults drive to work in separate gasoline guzzling SUVs, and they spend 4 weeks in their vacation home 3000 miles away that must be heated all winter to prevent the pipes from breaking.  This trend is not being discouraged to save energy but we try to squeeze a few BTUs out of building energy use with codes and standards.  
There is push for sustainable townships today that looks at both buildings and transportation. Check out this University of Kentucky website: http://www.cscdesignstudio.com/. I heard that there are plans to develop sustainable townships in India. An easier way to save energy, the environment (rain forests) and reduce water pollution is to control the human population.

Dear Varkie
Yes, I am still there. 
It was nice to find that you remember me. 
 As Guedi wrote you, we were lately involved in developing the energy Code for buildings in Israel , and we are still working on it, trying to define the perfect performance method, the perfect reference building, etc. and had many discussions about it. We thought to present our ideas at the coming IBPSA, and even sent an abstract that was accepted, but we are still working on it, and could not write the paper before having conclusions.  
 I am also working on the Israeli Green Building Code, which is quite new and suffers from not being rigorous enough. However, I don?t think that we should adopt LEED, which has its own defaults. As I don?t believe that I can improve LEED, while I believe that I can contribute my effort to improve the Israeli Green Building Code, therefore, I prefer our Code.
Please find attached a paper I wrote lately about LEED and PLEA.
 Sincerely yours, and hope to see you again,
Edna

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Percent Energy Savings
 ASHRAE Std90 for the baseline is already stringent and specifies the commonly used systems & plants based on building type and size.  Based on the CCGT building, high percentage energy savings for LEED certification can be achieved with low-rise buildings with a high exposure to floor surface areas to locate PV panels, high but efficient glass to wall area for day-lighting, the use of GSHP (which requires a large site area which may not be available in city blocks), and low common energy consuming systems in baseline and proposed which increases ?percentage? energy savings.  
 A school building is low-rise, is low in process loads (increases % savings) and is high in occupancy ventilation which allows for air-to-air heat recovery. It operates only during the day increasing the impact of day-lighting. It is closed in summer, reducing the annual cooling load and increases the impact of solar heating during the rest of the year in cold climates.  So it is possible to achieve zero energy usage.  
 
The choices are limited in the case of inner city high-rise buildings.  Today?s high-rise office building design tries to maximize the glass percentage which increases the impact of day-lighting.  The glass could have PV properties with a very small overall efficiency of converting light to 110V electricity.  The ASHRAE Std90 baseline for Systems and Plants for such a building is considered normal design.  UFAD and other options are not typical.  The proposed envelope has to offset the 40% Window-Wall-Ratio specified by ASHRAE.   If the office building envelope is used for a hospital or hotel, which operate 8760 hours/year, then the percent energy savings will go down.  
 
High percent energy savings does not therefore necessarily mean a better or optimized designed building in terms of the client?s interests.  Percent energy savings should therefore not be the criteria for energy efficient building design.  It should be based on Energy Conservation Measures (ECM) used for the given building that are more energy efficient compared to ASHRAE Std90 for the given building type and size which usually results in increased first costs. The ECMs are going to be different for different types of buildings in different locations.  If the ECM used is inappropriate, then the client pays a price for the high percent energy savings.

You can also export SketchUp models into Radiance directly with the  
su2rad plugin developed by Thomas Bleicher.

As far as the simulation engines mentioned above, yes, Max uses the  
Mental Ray raytracer and Daysim uses Radiance.

Gidday All

There are two lighting programs that I am aware of that 'interface' with Google SketchUp (standard or Pro):

ONE: Radiance
Daysim (http://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ie/lighting/daylight/daysim_e.html ) which models the annual availability of daylight inside buildings using the rigorously validated (http://lrt.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/27/4/181 ) render engine Radiance (http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/ ) as its underlying calculation engine. However, it should be pointed out that 'integration' means that IF you have the Pro version of SU, THEN you can export to the .3ds  file format that the Daysim program will import. The author, Christoph Reinhart, has referred recently to Daysim 3 being in the process of validation and incorporating some of the newer daylight performance metrics - but no reference to greater integration with SU.

Radiance in its raw form can be used simply on a file exported by Thomas Bleicher's su2rad (https://www.ohloh.net/p/su2rad ) exporter. Saved scenes become saved viewpoints in Radiance. Materials and skies can be defined within SU prior to export. There is as yet no render control 'button' within the exporter interface, but everything else is there. Running Radiance of course requires a knowledge of Unix (see http://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/ ) or having a copy of Ecotect's Radiance Control Panel (www.ecotect.com<http://www.ecotect.com> ) and the Windows executables for Radiance (http://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/modules.php?op=modload&name=Downloads&file=index&req=viewdownload&cid=4 - the MinGW version) This works with both the versions of SU.

IES has a plugin (http://www.iesve.com/content/default.asp?page=s156 ) which will export from SU to their Virtual Environment format. If you have bought their full product, then you will again have access to Radiance, which as I understand it is distributed as the render engine for IES. I understand this works with both the versions of SU.

TWO: 3DS Max
mentalray within the 3DS Max software from Autodesk (http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?id=5659302&siteID=123112 ) has been validated recently (http://images.autodesk.com/adsk/files/3ds_max_design-exposure_validation.pdf ) by Christoph Reinhart. To transfer files from SU again you will need the Pro version.

Dear Mark and others,

 

Interesting threat. Michael listed a series of workflows that one can
use to analyze a SketchUp scene using either Radiance or 3ds Max
Design/Mental Ray. Michael also pointed out that these two simulation
engines have been successfully validated based on measured indoor
illuminances. Before picking any of these workflows I recommend that you
first carefully decide what you actually want to calculate using
daylight simulations.

 

*         For a LEED 8.1 Daylighting Credit compliance simulation most
of the work flows described by Michael should work since the 'old' CIE
clear sky as well as the CIE overcast sky (for daylight factor
calculations) are supported by Radiance and 3ds Max. If this is your
objective it is worthwhile mentioning that there are many designs that
fail the LEED glazing/daylight factor requirement according to
simulations but meet it via the spreadsheet method from the LEED
technical manual (see p.32:
www.gsd.harvard.edu/people/faculty/reinhart/documents/DiffuseDaylighting
DesignSequence.pdf) .

*         For physically based images both engines can be used (pay
attention that you actually use Mental Ray as the engine for your 3ds
Max simulations). Mental Ray tends to be faster than Radiance but
Radiance offers richer analysis capabilities including various glare
indices (if one is willing to use Radiance via the command line).

*         Climate-based daylighting metrics have been proposed to be
superior design measures than the daylight factor
(http://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/pubs/fulltext/nrcc48669/nrcc48669.pdf
<http://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/pubs/fulltext/nrcc48669/nrcc48669.pdf> ) and
IESNA and CIE are currently working on benchmark levels for these
metrics. To calculate a climate-based metric you can use Daysim, SPOT
and (in principal) even 3ds Max. The caveat for 3ds Max is that the
calculations would currently take a long time (page 29
www.autodesk.com/us/3dsmaxdesign/B3241.MentalRayValidation_v3.pdf
<http://www.autodesk.com/us/3dsmaxdesign/B3241.MentalRayValidation_v3.pd
f> ).

*         For integrated lighting-thermal simulations one can either use
a build-in method (e.g. in EnergyPlus or DOE2.1) or link the thermal
simulation program with externally calculated annual illuminance
profiles. The latter methods tends to be more accurate.

 

>>Ramana Koti wrote: I don't think the choice of materials that can be
assigned from within SketchUp is that comprehensive yet ... I'd be
interested in hearing from Christoph ... when we'll be able to assign
user created materials to surfaces within SketchUp before exporting to
DAYSIM.

We once had a good workflow from Sketchup 4 to Daysim via the 3ds format
that allowed the user to  use a custom material library in SketchUp to
automatically assign materials in Daysim. The 3ds export file format in
SketchUp 5 was unfortunately slightly changed so that this workflow is
not valid any more. I am now using Thomas Bleicher's earlier mentioned
SketchUp to Radiance exporter. I find the only 'hiccup' with this
approach to be that the exporter writes out all layers into separate
files which have to be individually imported into Daysim. I also have to
manually assign the materials, i.e. there is still room for improvement.

 

A general warning for any daylight simulations based on a SketchUp scene
is that SketchUp allows to assign different material properties to the
two surfaces of a polygon. This leaves room for errors since Radiance
only recognizes one material type per polygon.

I believe you are correct.  This is how we have always modeled that type
of BL system.  The heat pumps use electricity to extract heat from the
loop, but the actual heating source is the gas-fired boiler.

Has anyone modeled an indirect hot water heater in eQUEST?  I can not find a way to model an indirect unit that is fed 200 F hot water from the boiler hw loop to heat water to 135 F for domestic hot water use.  There is no option for an indirect hot water unit and I can not select a domestic hot water loop for the discharge of a thermal storage tank.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks so much.

I know this has been asked once or twice before, but I haven't had too much

Has anyone successfully modeled a heat recovery chiller in Equest that would
reject heat to a domestic hot water loop and would like to share a step by

Hi all,

Is there a way to model all the window overhangs at 30 degree downward tilt instead of 90 degrees (default) in eQUEST?

Any suggestion will be much appreciated.

Thank you

Teck,


   1. You will need to be in the 'Detailed Data Edit Mode' to be able to
   accomplish this.
   2. Once there, check the properties of a window and get to the
   'Fins-Overhang' tab.
   3. Change the angle (OAng) to 60 degree - that will actually give you the
   30 deg downward tilt you want.
   4. If you want to do this for several windows, go to the windows
   properties spreadsheet, change display mode to 'Fins & Overhang', and change
   the overhang properties here. You can edit numbers for one window and copy
   them for others.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Building Infiltration
Message-ID: <49B63000.E70E.0034.0@aeieng.com>

Hello,

I'm involved with a project that is considering pursuing LEED certification.  It is a remodel/renovation of an existing office building.

The existing office building has quite a bit of infiltration.  As part of the renovation process, the exterior walls are being sprayed with a foam insulation that will significantly reduce this infiltration.  Someone has asked the question, if we can take credit for this reduction in infiltration.  In other words, they want to model the Appendix G baseline building with the old infiltration rate and model the proposed building with the new infiltration rate.  This will show a good amount of energy cost savings.

Is this acceptable?  I'm having a difficult time finding any reference to infiltration rates within Appendix G.

Thanks,

There aren't any.  There are a few standards that have infiltration
baselines.  I believe the HERS (Home Energy Rating System) uses an
infiltration baseline of about 0.35-0.4 ACH, and there are some other
standards out there.  Of course, some people will argue that the building
should be positively pressurized so that there will be no infiltration.  I
don't know of anyone that has gotten credit for LEED EA C1 for infiltration,
but in my opinion, this is a huge Appendix G oversight.  My suggestion is to
apply for a CIR and suggest an infiltration baseline.  If the building is
100% renovation, the baseline could be established using a blower door test
on the original building, or you could come up with another reasonable,
established baseline.

While I agree that there is oversight in not giving credit to reduce infiltration, I do not feel like LEED credit should be given if there isn't an established baseline.  Say, for example, the building infiltration was exceptionally poor.  Improving the building to even average infiltration performance may have a large effect on the energy model, and LEED points would be given for a building that may or may not deserve it.  While improving the infiltration issue saves energy for the owner, there is no guarantee that the building does not perform poorly.  Maybe there should be a LEED "most improved" award which uses existing conditions as the baseline.

Message-ID: <17FB4E08B4F54463990DB837C88835CF@VaioTower>

Here's my take on it. The baseline building envelope on a renovation is
supposed to be modeled in the pre-renovated condition. This would include
wall and window thermal properties (U, SHGC, etc.) as well as infiltration
estimates. The proposed design would incorporate all changes and
improvements to the envelope and be modeled as such. It should be noted
however that Section 5.4.3 of 90.1-2004 contains mandatory provisions for
air leakage so the proposed design must at least meet the mandatory
requirements.
 
It is unrealistic to assume a positive pressurization strategy eliminates
infiltration. Keep in mind infiltration occurs due to the vapor pressure and
air pressure differences across the envelope. During unoccupied periods fans
usually do not run so a positive pressurization strategy will not work if
fans are off. During the evenings and weekends the vapor pressure will
equalize from inside to outside bringing in any vapor in this air. Blower
door tests are not practical for most commercial buildings due to the large
volume of air movement required to create a pressure differential. Central
AHU supply and exhaust fans could be used with DDC controls to measure air
leakage provided flow measuring instrumentation was installed.

Craig J. Gann, P.E.

We have a bit of an in-office argument going on and I was wondering if
people could share some insight on the subject.

 

Situation:

A user has a VAV system with dampers at the VAV boxes and a VFD on the
supply fan.  To properly model this, would the user make sure that the Fan
EIR is 'Variable Speed Drive FPLR' and then change Fan Control to
'Discharge' or leave it as 'Fan EIR FPLR'?

 

If you are supposed to leave the fan control dialogue as 'Fan EIR FPLR' then
what is the purpose of being able to change the fan control if you have
already selected the appropriate Fan EIR curve?

 

Thanks for helping solve the in-office dispute,

My understanding is that if you are doing LEED EBOM certification, the
energy credits are based on actual utility bills post-retrofit via the
Energy Star Portfolio Manager tool.  Modeling is still useful to show
the benefit of the infiltration reduction, but I don't believe you need
to follow Appendix G for LEED EBOM.  Is there some other LEED program
for existing buildings that does use Appendix G?

Hello,

I'm involved with a project that is considering pursuing LEED
certification.  It is a remodel/renovation of an existing office
building.

The existing office building has quite a bit of infiltration.  As part
of the renovation process, the exterior walls are being sprayed with a
foam insulation that will significantly reduce this infiltration.
Someone has asked the question, if we can take credit for this reduction
in infiltration.  In other words, they want to model the Appendix G
baseline building with the old infiltration rate and model the proposed
building with the new infiltration rate.  This will show a good amount
of energy cost savings.

Is this acceptable?  I'm having a difficult time finding any reference
to infiltration rates within Appendix G.

Thanks,

Mark Prince

In addition to what Craig says below the very idea that it is okay to blow
energy out of the building or suck in unconditioned air at a high, variable,
uncontrolled rates due to high leakage through the envelope in both
directions dependent upon pressure differentials  is certainly not very
'green' or energy saving at the least and we feel contributes to much higher
energy use than necessary and we know it contributes to higher maintenance

is not easy, is not something that HVAC manufacturers/companies/ ASHRAE can
contend with, and requires knowledgeable on site inspection during
construction/remodel/repair it does not get the attention it deserves.  My
belief is that it is a significant contributor to why modeling software does
not match up well with reality.

 

Furthermore, someone please take me to any existing 10 (heck 5) story or
taller  building that does not desperately try to suck in air low and spew
it out high and any low rise with meaningfully controlled building envelope
conditioned air management.  It is almost impossible to find complete vapor
barriers where they need to be at wall/roof interfaces let alone the rest of
it.

 

We have seen these same issues in LEED certified, yes certified, new
buildings as the reward is low for actual building envelope air and moisture
penetration control (versus showing a design and calculation that shows it
is low) and no one is interested in inspecting and making sure the work is
done to meet LEED, heck even base code, requirements because so far there is
zero penalty (LEED, code, GBI, or anyone else).  The energy savings for
existing buildings can be significant and the lowered repair and maintenance
costs for the building envelope are significant if air and moisture
penetration are controlled but the emphasis is certainly not there most of

My feeling is that we absolutely should reward with LEED points, attaboys,
smiles, pats on the back, tax credits, and everything else we can things

Here's my take on it. The baseline building envelope on a renovation is
supposed to be modeled in the pre-renovated condition. This would include
wall and window thermal properties (U, SHGC, etc.) as well as infiltration
estimates. The proposed design would incorporate all changes and
improvements to the envelope and be modeled as such. It should be noted
however that Section 5.4.3 of 90.1-2004 contains mandatory provisions for
air leakage so the proposed design must at least meet the mandatory
requirements.

 

It is unrealistic to assume a positive pressurization strategy eliminates
infiltration. Keep in mind infiltration occurs due to the vapor pressure and
air pressure differences across the envelope. During unoccupied periods fans
usually do not run so a positive pressurization strategy will not work if
fans are off. During the evenings and weekends the vapor pressure will
equalize from inside to outside bringing in any vapor in this air. Blower
door tests are not practical for most commercial buildings due to the large
volume of air movement required to create a pressure differential. Central
AHU supply and exhaust fans could be used with DDC controls to measure air
leakage provided flow measuring instrumentation was installed.

While I agree that there is oversight in not giving credit to reduce
infiltration, I do not feel like LEED credit should be given if there isn't
an established baseline.  Say, for example, the building infiltration was
exceptionally poor.  Improving the building to even average infiltration
performance may have a large effect on the energy model, and LEED points
would be given for a building that may or may not deserve it.  While
improving the infiltration issue saves energy for the owner, there is no
guarantee that the building does not perform poorly.  Maybe there should be
a LEED "most improved" award which uses existing conditions as the baseline.

There aren't any.  There are a few standards that have infiltration
baselines.  I believe the HERS (Home Energy Rating System) uses an
infiltration baseline of about 0.35-0.4 ACH, and there are some other
standards out there.  Of course, some people will argue that the building
should be positively pressurized so that there will be no infiltration.  I
don't know of anyone that has gotten credit for LEED EA C1 for infiltration,
but in my opinion, this is a huge Appendix G oversight.  My suggestion is to
apply for a CIR and suggest an infiltration baseline.  If the building is
100% renovation, the baseline could be established using a blower door test
on the original building, or you could come up with another reasonable,
established baseline.

Andy, you're right on!  Doug is also spot on re: LEED EBOM.  EBOM actually
measures results, something LEED-NC cannot do because it's models aren't
built yet.
 
Infiltration calcs have always been a thorn in the side of anyone
calculating heating / cooling loads since they're so dependent on actual
construction practice (not to mention the effects of aging, settling, etc.)
In theory, a savvy building owner will continue to pay attention to energy
use over the life of the building and observe rising energy use that's
well-correlated to infiltration -- then fix it.  
 
That's a rare owner, I know!

	Here's my take on it. The baseline building envelope on a
renovation is supposed to be modeled in the pre-renovated condition.
This would include wall and window thermal properties (U, SHGC, etc.) as
well as infiltration estimates. The proposed design would incorporate
all changes and improvements to the envelope and be modeled as such. It
should be noted however that Section 5.4.3 of 90.1-2004 contains
mandatory provisions for air leakage so the proposed design must at
least meet the mandatory requirements.
	 
	It is unrealistic to assume a positive pressurization strategy
eliminates infiltration. Keep in mind infiltration occurs due to the
vapor pressure and air pressure differences across the envelope. During
unoccupied periods fans usually do not run so a positive pressurization
strategy will not work if fans are off. During the evenings and weekends
the vapor pressure will equalize from inside to outside bringing in any
vapor in this air. Blower door tests are not practical for most
commercial buildings due to the large volume of air movement required to
create a pressure differential. Central AHU supply and exhaust fans
could be used with DDC controls to measure air leakage provided flow
measuring instrumentation was installed.

		While I agree that there is oversight in not giving
credit to reduce infiltration, I do not feel like LEED credit should be
given if there isn't an established baseline.  Say, for example, the
building infiltration was exceptionally poor.  Improving the building to
even average infiltration performance may have a large effect on the
energy model, and LEED points would be given for a building that may or
may not deserve it.  While improving the infiltration issue saves energy
for the owner, there is no guarantee that the building does not perform
poorly.  Maybe there should be a LEED "most improved" award which uses
existing conditions as the baseline.

		There aren't any.  There are a few standards that have
infiltration baselines.  I believe the HERS (Home Energy Rating System)
uses an infiltration baseline of about 0.35-0.4 ACH, and there are some
other standards out there.  Of course, some people will argue that the
building should be positively pressurized so that there will be no
infiltration.  I don't know of anyone that has gotten credit for LEED EA
C1 for infiltration, but in my opinion, this is a huge Appendix G
oversight.  My suggestion is to apply for a CIR and suggest an
infiltration baseline.  If the building is 100% renovation, the baseline
could be established using a blower door test on the original building,
or you could come up with another reasonable, established baseline.

Hi All,

 

We currently use TAS for energy modelling and Radiance for daylight
simulation.

 

Virtually every architect that we work with provides us with 3D models,
but we seem to spend a lot of time re drawing models or fixing 3D models
to be able to work with the software that we use. The ultimate goal for
us would be to use one model for daylight and energy models, but I
haven't found that quite that simple as most software requires varying
drawing techniques.

 

Has anyone got any suggestions on the kind of software that they use
that could help out with the goal of ours?

 

We would like to investigate energy plus compared to TAS. Is there an
energy plus preprossor that could export models for radiance as well. I
have sent quite some time trying to do this with ecotect, but ecotect is
not the best software for importing 3D models as it doesn't take IFC
files or even dwg's.

 

I would be interested in investigating how well sketchup could be the
intermediate pre-processor. I have seen some radiance models that have
come from sketchup direct from an architectural model and they look
great. Has anyone used sketch to provide and energy plus model?

 

Thanks in advance.

Amen brother!  Another issue is that while the energy model has to  
include the total building -- all spaces and systems -- to be a  
complete picture of the energy use, a Radiance-based daylight model  
does not necessarily require all the spaces to be modeled  
simultaneously.  Indeed, the accuracy of the ambient calculation is  
directly affected by the maximum size of the scene, and so conducting  
a simultaneous daylight simulation of an entire building at an  
acceptably rigorous ambient resolution can be -- is generally -- time- 
prohibitive.

As mentioned in a recent thread on this list, Thomas Bleicher's  
"su2rad" plugin for SketchUp can export a SU model to Radiance format  
and there is also an E+ plugin to allow one to use the same SU model  
for E+ analysis; in theory, these three components (SketchUp, su2rad  
and the E+ plugin) allow for a "single model" approach to energy and  
daylight modeling. However, because the su2rad exporter wants to take  
the entire model and create a single Radiance scene description, that  
creates the aforementioned problem of the ambient calculation getting  
out of hand fairly quickly.  I suppose through intelligent layering  
and model structuring, one could create a model that could be exported  
to Radiance in "space components", but I'm not sure if this is  
compatible with the E+ plugin's layering/model organization  
requirements.

Actually, I'm utilising IES to do HVAC design, Energy Analysis, PMV
calc, lighting lux design, lighting power intensity design and natural
daylight analysis all in line with the Australian Standards and Green
Star (another form of LEED) requirements. 
 
Although the software costs money, I've found it to be worthwhile
battling against it's flaws and it gives us the results which we
require. 
 
Please note, this is a one model approach. It's easy to start a project
at CD (concept design) stage within Google Sketchup and to utilise the
freeware version of IES to do alternate design analysis. However, it's
way better if the full suite is purchases and the model is crossed over
into IES. Within IES multiple analysis and detailed designs can be
modelled quickly and with fantastic final project results. I know, I've
done it.
 
Also with the daylight analysis, if you've got a detailed building with
over 100000 surfaces, it's going to take forever to do the analysis,
that's my only issue with the software. However, the software is
developing multithreading facility within it's software, therefore
decreasing the time for analysis dramatically.
 
Should anyone want to discuss my approaches further, and are in
Brisbane, I welcome the opportunity to meet and greet with you.

Hi All - again

When I created my long post on the Daylighting models I self-edited because it was looking like going on forever. For example, I stopped short of listing the full range of software that has been subject to validation exercises, and stuck to just those that have been validated against measured data. There is for example the validation suite created by the CIE to be an equivalent for lighting of the IEA BESTEST / ASHRAE 140 validation process for thermal simulation programs. To my knowledge, AGI 32 and the Integra software from Japan have undergone this validation process.

This most recent post returns our focus to energy simulation. I have over the past six months of a sabbatical at the Lawrence Lab in Berkeley CA come to know and appreciate the COMFEN program which is targeted at providing the power of the EnergyPlus program, very early in the design of a building.  Programs like EnergyPlus have inbuilt engines for calculating light distributions due to daylight. The COMFEN (http://windows.lbl.gov/software/comfen/2/index.html ) program from LBNL makes some of the daylight calculations within EnergyPlus accessible in these very early phases of the design process. This is fully integrated.

Clearly an add-on for daylighting to a thermal simulation program will not be the best lighting program. However, it should be sufficiently accurate for many purposes where thermal and daylight performance are combined.

Rob, you are correct about the su2rad/OpenStudio plugins for SketchUp. Because the OpenStudio plugin from DOE/NREL will read EnergyPlus input (idf) files, SketchUp is the potential integrator of COMFEN/EnergyPlus and Radiance. It works well here because of the elegance of the underlying template for the COMFEN EnergyPlus model. But even here it has limitations. The thermal simulation model representation of a wall is a set of 3D coordinates locating a surface in space and its orientation to the sun. The thickness and thermal properties are represented mathematically. Reading an EnergyPlus '.idf' file into SketchUp reveals windows with no frame and reveals with no depth - anathema to the good daylight modeler. If one creates buildings with depth for daylighting in SketchUp, one needs to specify thermal zones within the model before exporting to EnergyPlus.

The single BIM model that links to all analytical programs but is independent of them all is an ideal that has been worked on since the days of the COMBINE project in Europe 20 or so years ago. Many are working still on it. Logic suggests it is the most elegant solution to the dilemma of exchange of information between many different analytical programs. But this simple illustration suggests to me that the Building Information Model is not SketchUp. It is merely one on a long line of geometry creation tools. It is unusual in that it can be used to create lighting, acoustic or thermal models. But it merely creates a common starting point for these separate analytical tools.

Hi All,

Excellent study assessing commercial programs that have integrated solar
gain and daylighting is already available for those who would like to learn
more. Several programs were validated through experiments under the IEA's
SHC Task 34 / ECBCS Annex 43 Project C, titled "Empirical validations of
Shading / Daylighting / Load Interactions in Building Energy Simulation
Tools," (August 2007).

A short version focusing only on EnergyPlus & DOE-2.1E is also available in
Energy 32(2007): 1855-1870, Loutzenhiser et al., "An empirical validation of
the daylighting algorithms and associated interactions in building energy
simulation programs using various shading devices and windows," Elsevier
Ltd.

Needless to say, commercial programs with integrated daylighting algorithms
should be able to simulate, within a certain confidence level, various types
of shading devices (internal / external; venetian / mini-blinds), glazing
types (wavelength selective), light shelves / wells, dome fenestration and
double-skin facades. Until then, it is best to use separate specialized
programs if you are concerned about rich, quality data.

Tony-

When you define a chiller in eQuest, along with assigning the appropriate
CHW (and possibly CW and HW) there is also a loop assignment for "HtRec".
This takes either a HW, WLHP, or DHW Loop to which the chiller will attempt
to provide recovered heat to.  There are some variables you will need to
fill in depending on how much heat you want to recover, etc...

If that doesn't answer your question, please let me know.

Hi, everyone
I am trying to find the monthly-average soil temperature and humidity with different depth (say, 20cm, 50cm and below 50 cm) in Guangzhou, China. But all I can find are the cities in west China or in Hongkong, which is located in south China too. Does anyone know where I can find these data for Guangzhou? Or how big the differences are between HK and GZ? If it is not a very big difference, I think I can just use HK data.

Any comments or suggestions on this topic are highly appreciated.

Thanks!

Message-ID: <EE3F700B3DD9D642BEA5D0B0A805C61219DD11450D@mail.hallam2000.com>

Good Afternoon Mark et al:

I agree with Karen that the infiltration modeling requirements of baseline and proposed are very poorly defined in App G or ECB, and there's no real data in 90.1 section 5.4.3.  A few years back I saw a study on average commercial construction infiltration rates and the general result was ACHs of 0.3 to 0.4.  ASHRAE Fundamentals 05 Ch27.23, discusses commercial building infiltration and lists test results with a range from 0.1 to 1 ACH.  I typically use the same infiltration rate between baseline and proposed when modeling for LEED, UNLESS I have defendable information in the Construction Documents to corroborate a different rate.  For example I had a project whose specs called for blower door testing to prove that overall infiltration did not exceed 0.2 ACH and for the basline I modeled 0.4 ACH, in that job my proposed showed energy improvement via infiltration management as I was able to defend the descrepancy between proposed and basline.

Unless you can defend the difference between the two models I would recommend modeling the same rates.  A blower door test on the original existing building compared to one done on the finished renovations would give you all the defense you need.  One performed just on the new building if it proves the actual rate to be much less then the 0.4 ACH average, in my opinion would probably be defendable enough.

Good Luck,
Josh

There aren't any.  There are a few standards that have infiltration baselines.  I believe the HERS (Home Energy Rating System) uses an infiltration baseline of about 0.35-0.4 ACH, and there are some other standards out there.  Of course, some people will argue that the building should be positively pressurized so that there will be no infiltration.  I don't know of anyone that has gotten credit for LEED EA C1 for infiltration, but in my opinion, this is a huge Appendix G oversight.  My suggestion is to apply for a CIR and suggest an infiltration baseline.  If the building is 100% renovation, the baseline could be established using a blower door test on the original building, or you could come up with another reasonable, established baseline.

Hello,

I'm involved with a project that is considering pursuing LEED certification.
It is a remodel/renovation of an existing office building.

The existing office building has quite a bit of infiltration.  As part of the renovation process, the exterior walls are being sprayed with a foam insulation that will significantly reduce this infiltration.  Someone has asked the question, if we can take credit for this reduction in infiltration.  In other words, they want to model the Appendix G baseline building with the old infiltration rate and model the proposed building with the new infiltration rate.  This will show a good amount of energy cost savings.

Is this acceptable?  I'm having a difficult time finding any reference to infiltration rates within Appendix G.

Molly,

If you save the attachment by clicking on the link using the 
right mouse button you are given the option to save it and 
to name it. It is probably called something like 
"attachment.bin". You should rename the attachment with the 
original name of the file which is shown a few lines above 
the link. In this case it is ZIP file that can then be opened.

I wish it wasn't so complex.

I tried out IES-VE a few months or a year ago with some people because
the potential for this type of integration seemed very exciting.
However, we found the HVAC side to be pretty basic.  For a lot of
building types, there are significant savings to be had by changing HVAC
control schemes and/or configurations and using HVAC types that were not
well-represented in IES-VE the last time I saw it.  It seemed like a
great interface to use if you were trying to design a building to use
minimal energy due to envelope, orientation, natural ventilation, etc.
In other words, it seems strong on the loads calculation side.  On the
system use side, though, it seemed a lot more limited than DOE2 or
EnergyPlus.  For that reason, I have also stuck with the multiple-tools
method.  I agree with all who wrote that it would be wonderful to have
one integrated tool in the future!  Rob does bring up an interesting
point about the resolution of spaces needed for daylighting vs. thermal
vs. architectural modeling.  Architects especially have to be so
detailed in their models that I've often just ended up using the floor
plans they provided, deleting a bunch of elements out of those, and
scaling wall heights and windows.  Other than that, their 3D models only
serve to help me visualize the building myself.  It would be nice if we
didn't end up tripling the effort like we all do now, but so far I don't
see a great way around it (unless you don't need complex system modeling
- then you could use IES-VE as discussed below).

Actually, I'm utilising IES to do HVAC design, Energy Analysis, PMV
calc, lighting lux design, lighting power intensity design and natural
daylight analysis all in line with the Australian Standards and Green
Star (another form of LEED) requirements. 

 

Although the software costs money, I've found it to be worthwhile
battling against it's flaws and it gives us the results which we
require. 

 

Please note, this is a one model approach. It's easy to start a project
at CD (concept design) stage within Google Sketchup and to utilise the
freeware version of IES to do alternate design analysis. However, it's
way better if the full suite is purchases and the model is crossed over
into IES. Within IES multiple analysis and detailed designs can be
modelled quickly and with fantastic final project results. I know, I've
done it.

 

Also with the daylight analysis, if you've got a detailed building with
over 100000 surfaces, it's going to take forever to do the analysis,
that's my only issue with the software. However, the software is
developing multithreading facility within it's software, therefore
decreasing the time for analysis dramatically.

 

Should anyone want to discuss my approaches further, and are in
Brisbane, I welcome the opportunity to meet and greet with you.

Amen brother!  Another issue is that while the energy model has to
include the total building -- all spaces and systems -- to be a complete
picture of the energy use, a Radiance-based daylight model does not
necessarily require all the spaces to be modeled simultaneously.
Indeed, the accuracy of the ambient calculation is directly affected by
the maximum size of the scene, and so conducting a simultaneous daylight
simulation of an entire building at an acceptably rigorous ambient
resolution can be -- is generally -- time-prohibitive.

 

As mentioned in a recent thread on this list, Thomas Bleicher's "su2rad"
plugin for SketchUp can export a SU model to Radiance format and there
is also an E+ plugin to allow one to use the same SU model for E+
analysis; in theory, these three components (SketchUp, su2rad and the E+
plugin) allow for a "single model" approach to energy and daylight
modeling. However, because the su2rad exporter wants to take the entire
model and create a single Radiance scene description, that creates the
aforementioned problem of the ambient calculation getting out of hand
fairly quickly.  I suppose through intelligent layering and model
structuring, one could create a model that could be exported to Radiance
in "space components", but I'm not sure if this is compatible with the
E+ plugin's layering/model organization requirements.

Zhoulun,

There is little real measured data on soil temperatures and humidities
in different locations. What is found in the weather files are all
calculated using a simple equation developed by the late Prof. Tam
Kusuda of the National Bureau of Standards (now NIST) in the early 80's.
It's basically a sine curve where the lag increases and the amplitude
flattens the further down into the ground you go. The steady state
constant deep ground temperature is very well approximated as the
average annual air temperature plus 1 C. I can send you the code in
Fortran from DOE-2 if you're interested.

The only time to worry is if your site is near to a volcanic hot spot or
hot springs. The other source of ground temperatures are well water
temperatures. For China, you'd probably have better luck asking
geologists or geographers in China, rather than the readers of BLDG-SIM.

According to another Bldg-Sim member, my statement of basic HVAC
calculations could be misleading, so I will clarify in case it bothered
anyone else.  If one would describe natural ventilation as an HVAC
calculation, then I would *not* describe IES-VE as "basic" in that
context.  That capability seemed very strong to me in IES-VE.  However,
if you want to model sophisticated HVAC *mechanical* equipment (yes,
this could be a gray area since HVAC can integrate with NV via controls
on the windows, so suffice it to say that I'm talking about all HVAC
*except* NV and didn't come up with a more bulletproof term), then it
does not have as wide an array of options as DOE2 and EnergyPlus.  I
thought I stated that below in the fourth sentence, but maybe it gets
confusing along the way.  This is as of several months ago, and I didn't
check out a new version and do a thorough review just to write this
email.  So if a bunch of new HVAC capabilities have been added, then
that could date some of my statements.  Apologies to anyone who thought
I was trying to trash IES-VE because I definitely did not intend to do
that.  I think it's an impressive program and probably useful to a lot
of people.

I tried out IES-VE a few months or a year ago with some people because
the potential for this type of integration seemed very exciting.
However, we found the HVAC side to be pretty basic.  For a lot of
building types, there are significant savings to be had by changing HVAC
control schemes and/or configurations and using HVAC types that were not
well-represented in IES-VE the last time I saw it.  It seemed like a
great interface to use if you were trying to design a building to use
minimal energy due to envelope, orientation, natural ventilation, etc.
In other words, it seems strong on the loads calculation side.  On the
system use side, though, it seemed a lot more limited than DOE2 or
EnergyPlus.  For that reason, I have also stuck with the multiple-tools
method.  I agree with all who wrote that it would be wonderful to have
one integrated tool in the future!  Rob does bring up an interesting
point about the resolution of spaces needed for daylighting vs. thermal
vs. architectural modeling.  Architects especially have to be so
detailed in their models that I've often just ended up using the floor
plans they provided, deleting a bunch of elements out of those, and
scaling wall heights and windows.  Other than that, their 3D models only
serve to help me visualize the building myself.  It would be nice if we
didn't end up tripling the effort like we all do now, but so far I don't
see a great way around it (unless you don't need complex system modeling
- then you could use IES-VE as discussed below).

Actually, I'm utilising IES to do HVAC design, Energy Analysis, PMV
calc, lighting lux design, lighting power intensity design and natural
daylight analysis all in line with the Australian Standards and Green
Star (another form of LEED) requirements. 

 

Although the software costs money, I've found it to be worthwhile
battling against it's flaws and it gives us the results which we
require. 

 

Please note, this is a one model approach. It's easy to start a project
at CD (concept design) stage within Google Sketchup and to utilise the
freeware version of IES to do alternate design analysis. However, it's
way better if the full suite is purchases and the model is crossed over
into IES. Within IES multiple analysis and detailed designs can be
modelled quickly and with fantastic final project results. I know, I've
done it.

 

Also with the daylight analysis, if you've got a detailed building with
over 100000 surfaces, it's going to take forever to do the analysis,
that's my only issue with the software. However, the software is
developing multithreading facility within it's software, therefore
decreasing the time for analysis dramatically.

 

Should anyone want to discuss my approaches further, and are in
Brisbane, I welcome the opportunity to meet and greet with you.

Amen brother!  Another issue is that while the energy model has to
include the total building -- all spaces and systems -- to be a complete
picture of the energy use, a Radiance-based daylight model does not
necessarily require all the spaces to be modeled simultaneously.
Indeed, the accuracy of the ambient calculation is directly affected by
the maximum size of the scene, and so conducting a simultaneous daylight
simulation of an entire building at an acceptably rigorous ambient
resolution can be -- is generally -- time-prohibitive.

 

As mentioned in a recent thread on this list, Thomas Bleicher's "su2rad"
plugin for SketchUp can export a SU model to Radiance format and there
is also an E+ plugin to allow one to use the same SU model for E+
analysis; in theory, these three components (SketchUp, su2rad and the E+
plugin) allow for a "single model" approach to energy and daylight
modeling. However, because the su2rad exporter wants to take the entire
model and create a single Radiance scene description, that creates the
aforementioned problem of the ambient calculation getting out of hand
fairly quickly.  I suppose through intelligent layering and model
structuring, one could create a model that could be exported to Radiance
in "space components", but I'm not sure if this is compatible with the
E+ plugin's layering/model organization requirements.

Hey folks:

 

Yes, we have seen that ASHRAE and ASTM have/are promulgating various
standards (and indeed some have existed for quite some time) and so on but a
real problem is that there are no test or inspection (by far the more
"doable") requirements for completed assemblies/buildings.  When you combine
this with the fact that much of the work is impossible/very difficult to
view once a structure is completed and that attention to detail is
absolutely required for proper construction it is easy to see why most
buildings built do not meet their design "requirements".

 

How many here have ever seen one of their buildings inspected at various
points as they are constructed for building envelope component, let alone
total system proper construction and effectiveness???  Nice mock ups but....

 

It is one reason why at least many (I feel most) LEED and other "green"
buildings do not meet their design "requirements" for
infiltration/exfiltration/moisture transport/energy usage and so on.

 

We believe that there needs to be an inspection/sign-off certification for
the building envelope components and as a whole, and not from local code
enforcement.  The payback in energy usage, environmental impact, and
structure life/cost effectiveness all will be significant.  Most certainly
comfort will also be improved.

 

Thanks,

Andy, you're right on!  Doug is also spot on re: LEED EBOM.  EBOM actually
measures results, something LEED-NC cannot do because it's models aren't
built yet.

 

Infiltration calcs have always been a thorn in the side of anyone
calculating heating / cooling loads since they're so dependent on actual
construction practice (not to mention the effects of aging, settling, etc.)
In theory, a savvy building owner will continue to pay attention to energy
use over the life of the building and observe rising energy use that's
well-correlated to infiltration -- then fix it.  

 

That's a rare owner, I know!

In addition to what Craig says below the very idea that it is okay to blow
energy out of the building or suck in unconditioned air at a high, variable,
uncontrolled rates due to high leakage through the envelope in both
directions dependent upon pressure differentials  is certainly not very
'green' or energy saving at the least and we feel contributes to much higher
energy use than necessary and we know it contributes to higher maintenance
costs and lowered useful life of building envelope components.  Because it
is not easy, is not something that HVAC manufacturers/companies/ ASHRAE can
contend with, and requires knowledgeable on site inspection during
construction/remodel/repair it does not get the attention it deserves.  My
belief is that it is a significant contributor to why modeling software does
not match up well with reality.

 

Furthermore, someone please take me to any existing 10 (heck 5) story or
taller  building that does not desperately try to suck in air low and spew
it out high and any low rise with meaningfully controlled building envelope
conditioned air management.  It is almost impossible to find complete vapor
barriers where they need to be at wall/roof interfaces let alone the rest of
it.

 

We have seen these same issues in LEED certified, yes certified, new
buildings as the reward is low for actual building envelope air and moisture
penetration control (versus showing a design and calculation that shows it
is low) and no one is interested in inspecting and making sure the work is
done to meet LEED, heck even base code, requirements because so far there is
zero penalty (LEED, code, GBI, or anyone else).  The energy savings for
existing buildings can be significant and the lowered repair and maintenance
costs for the building envelope are significant if air and moisture
penetration are controlled but the emphasis is certainly not there most of
the time.  

 

My feeling is that we absolutely should reward with LEED points, attaboys,
smiles, pats on the back, tax credits, and everything else we can things
done to existing buildings that increase the useful life of components,
lower environmental impact, lower maintenance requirements and costs, and
decrease energy usage.  I thought that is what the goals were, ACTUAL
lowered environmental impact in all ways and lowered costs.  Building
envelope infiltration gets only lip service and design but there are no
inspection standards and accountability to prove the work is done
appropriately.

Here's my take on it. The baseline building envelope on a renovation is
supposed to be modeled in the pre-renovated condition. This would include
wall and window thermal properties (U, SHGC, etc.) as well as infiltration
estimates. The proposed design would incorporate all changes and
improvements to the envelope and be modeled as such. It should be noted
however that Section 5.4.3 of 90.1-2004 contains mandatory provisions for
air leakage so the proposed design must at least meet the mandatory
requirements.

 

It is unrealistic to assume a positive pressurization strategy eliminates
infiltration. Keep in mind infiltration occurs due to the vapor pressure and
air pressure differences across the envelope. During unoccupied periods fans
usually do not run so a positive pressurization strategy will not work if
fans are off. During the evenings and weekends the vapor pressure will
equalize from inside to outside bringing in any vapor in this air. Blower
door tests are not practical for most commercial buildings due to the large
volume of air movement required to create a pressure differential. Central
AHU supply and exhaust fans could be used with DDC controls to measure air
leakage provided flow measuring instrumentation was installed.

While I agree that there is oversight in not giving credit to reduce
infiltration, I do not feel like LEED credit should be given if there isn't
an established baseline.  Say, for example, the building infiltration was
exceptionally poor.  Improving the building to even average infiltration
performance may have a large effect on the energy model, and LEED points
would be given for a building that may or may not deserve it.  While
improving the infiltration issue saves energy for the owner, there is no
guarantee that the building does not perform poorly.  Maybe there should be
a LEED "most improved" award which uses existing conditions as the baseline.

There aren't any.  There are a few standards that have infiltration
baselines.  I believe the HERS (Home Energy Rating System) uses an
infiltration baseline of about 0.35-0.4 ACH, and there are some other
standards out there.  Of course, some people will argue that the building
should be positively pressurized so that there will be no infiltration.  I
don't know of anyone that has gotten credit for LEED EA C1 for infiltration,
but in my opinion, this is a huge Appendix G oversight.  My suggestion is to
apply for a CIR and suggest an infiltration baseline.  If the building is
100% renovation, the baseline could be established using a blower door test
on the original building, or you could come up with another reasonable,
established baseline.

Hello,

I'm involved with a project that is considering pursuing LEED certification.
It is a remodel/renovation of an existing office building.

The existing office building has quite a bit of infiltration.  As part of
the renovation process, the exterior walls are being sprayed with a foam
insulation that will significantly reduce this infiltration.  Someone has
asked the question, if we can take credit for this reduction in
infiltration.  In other words, they want to model the Appendix G baseline
building with the old infiltration rate and model the proposed building with
the new infiltration rate.  This will show a good amount of energy cost
savings.

Is this acceptable?  I'm having a difficult time finding any reference to
infiltration rates within Appendix G.

According to another Bldg-Sim member, my statement of basic HVAC
calculations could be misleading, so I will clarify in case it bothered
anyone else.  If one would describe natural ventilation as an HVAC
calculation, then I would *not* describe IES-VE as "basic" in that
context.  That capability seemed very strong to me in IES-VE.  However,
if you want to model sophisticated HVAC *mechanical* equipment (yes,
this could be a gray area since HVAC can integrate with NV via controls
on the windows, so suffice it to say that I'm talking about all HVAC
*except* NV and didn't come up with a more bulletproof term), then it
does not have as wide an array of options as DOE2 and EnergyPlus.  I
thought I stated that below in the fourth sentence, but maybe it gets
confusing along the way.  This is as of several months ago, and I didn't
check out a new version and do a thorough review just to write this
email.  So if a bunch of new HVAC capabilities have been added, then
that could date some of my statements.  Apologies to anyone who thought
I was trying to trash IES-VE because I definitely did not intend to do
that.  I think it's an impressive program and probably useful to a lot
of people.

I tried out IES-VE a few months or a year ago with some people because
the potential for this type of integration seemed very exciting.
However, we found the HVAC side to be pretty basic.  For a lot of
building types, there are significant savings to be had by changing HVAC
control schemes and/or configurations and using HVAC types that were not
well-represented in IES-VE the last time I saw it.  It seemed like a
great interface to use if you were trying to design a building to use
minimal energy due to envelope, orientation, natural ventilation, etc.
In other words, it seems strong on the loads calculation side.  On the
system use side, though, it seemed a lot more limited than DOE2 or
EnergyPlus.  For that reason, I have also stuck with the multiple-tools
method.  I agree with all who wrote that it would be wonderful to have
one integrated tool in the future!  Rob does bring up an interesting
point about the resolution of spaces needed for daylighting vs. thermal
vs. architectural modeling.  Architects especially have to be so
detailed in their models that I've often just ended up using the floor
plans they provided, deleting a bunch of elements out of those, and
scaling wall heights and windows.  Other than that, their 3D models only
serve to help me visualize the building myself.  It would be nice if we
didn't end up tripling the effort like we all do now, but so far I don't
see a great way around it (unless you don't need complex system modeling
- then you could use IES-VE as discussed below).

Actually, I'm utilising IES to do HVAC design, Energy Analysis, PMV
calc, lighting lux design, lighting power intensity design and natural
daylight analysis all in line with the Australian Standards and Green
Star (another form of LEED) requirements. 

 

Although the software costs money, I've found it to be worthwhile
battling against it's flaws and it gives us the results which we
require. 

 

Please note, this is a one model approach. It's easy to start a project
at CD (concept design) stage within Google Sketchup and to utilise the
freeware version of IES to do alternate design analysis. However, it's
way better if the full suite is purchases and the model is crossed over
into IES. Within IES multiple analysis and detailed designs can be
modelled quickly and with fantastic final project results. I know, I've
done it.

 

Also with the daylight analysis, if you've got a detailed building with
over 100000 surfaces, it's going to take forever to do the analysis,
that's my only issue with the software. However, the software is
developing multithreading facility within it's software, therefore
decreasing the time for analysis dramatically.

 

Should anyone want to discuss my approaches further, and are in
Brisbane, I welcome the opportunity to meet and greet with you.

Amen brother!  Another issue is that while the energy model has to
include the total building -- all spaces and systems -- to be a complete
picture of the energy use, a Radiance-based daylight model does not
necessarily require all the spaces to be modeled simultaneously.
Indeed, the accuracy of the ambient calculation is directly affected by
the maximum size of the scene, and so conducting a simultaneous daylight
simulation of an entire building at an acceptably rigorous ambient
resolution can be -- is generally -- time-prohibitive.

 

As mentioned in a recent thread on this list, Thomas Bleicher's "su2rad"
plugin for SketchUp can export a SU model to Radiance format and there
is also an E+ plugin to allow one to use the same SU model for E+
analysis; in theory, these three components (SketchUp, su2rad and the E+
plugin) allow for a "single model" approach to energy and daylight
modeling. However, because the su2rad exporter wants to take the entire
model and create a single Radiance scene description, that creates the
aforementioned problem of the ambient calculation getting out of hand
fairly quickly.  I suppose through intelligent layering and model
structuring, one could create a model that could be exported to Radiance
in "space components", but I'm not sure if this is compatible with the
E+ plugin's layering/model organization requirements.

All;
 
The IRS provides tax deductions for commercial buildings (up to $1.80 per square foot) for buildings that reduce energy costs beyond 90.1-2001.
 
Does anyone know if the newest federal legislation (American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009) has affected this program in any way?

Message-ID: <c61179940903140541r2c0b8b60k1158d8829fcd5e34@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,
A general question on system mapping and definition of building in
ASHRAE....

I am doing an energy model for a project which has got 5 individual
buildings of different heights and conditioned area.My question is while
selecting the "Baseline HVAC system type" as per table  G3.1.1.A of ASHRAE
90.1 2004, do we need to take all buildings together or we need to do system
mapping for individual buildings. Similarly while selecting the :Type and
Number of Chillers" for baseline as per table G3.1.3.7 is the building
conditioned floor area is the total project conditioned area or of
individual building conditioned area.So when you have multiple buildings in
a project you prepare individual model for each building or a combined model
for the whole project.

As per my understanding while doing the HVAC system mapping we need to do
the same for individual buildings and for chillers we need to take
conditioned area for the buildings where the system mapping shows cooling
type as "Chilled Water".

Thanks in advance

Russell,

The ACH data entered in DesignBuilder for infiltration, natural ventilation
and mechanical ventilation simply represents the air change rate that can be
expected to occur during typical operating conditions. This empirical
approach to modelling ventilation is useful for cases where you can estimate
ventilation flows from experience or you wish to use design assumptions. 

Alternatively you can of course also model the natural ventilation
calculations in more detail by using the 'calculated' natural ventilation
option which uses the EnergyPlus AirflowNetwork.

Design Builder has a few locations (e.g. infiltration, mech vent)  
where ACH is the input.  Does anyone know exactly what value they  
intended to be used? Specifically, the reference pressure for ACH?
Any insight into this matter is greatly appreciated.

General question:  Has anyone modeled a Ceiling/Bybass VAV System (aka
Changeover/Bybass VAV System) in eQUEST with a DX air cooled condensing
unit?

 

When I select this system it automatically wants me to assign a CHW loop.
The sub-tabs under the "Cooling" tab are "greyed-out" for "Unitary Power"
and "Condenser", basically preventing me from selecting a DX system.  

 

Is there anyway to override this so I can assign a DX system?  

 

Thanks, I sure do appreciate the help.

Hi,

I would like to know from our many simulation specialists which tools you
think are the most indicated for designers (using it to effectively support
design decisions). I believe that these tools must combine algorithm
robustness with interface resources (graphical modeling) and ease
operability (but I am interested in other opinions on that too).

I?ve been using DesignBuilder for a while and it works fine for me but I
think that the design process should be supported by multiple tools for
different purposes. Therefore if you could suggest tools for the following
items I would appreciate a lot:

1)      Climate analysis

2)      Thermal performance

3)      Energy assessment

4)      CFD calculations

Just to explain my interest?I am defining a group of tools which are
suitable for design activity to test its integration within the design
practice (that?s a part of my doctorate research).

Best regards,

Raoni Lima

Hi,

As an architect, I agree with you that we need software with both good
interface AND sophisticated engines. But I think we need more INSIGHT in
simulation to work with USER FRIENDLY software more than some software just
EASY TO USE.

On more point to add is: while the use of multiple software (or it is better
to say the use of different simulation techniques) is unavoidable in many
cases, but usually what we done with one simulation tool is almost ignored
when start the other simulation (e.g. a CFD and a thermal simulation).

I think the need of some tools with the ability to run combined simulations
is more than important, Especially when it comes to natural ventilation
design. I think run a combined multizone airflow network and thermal
simulation is more effective than a CFD simulation, but the current software
vendors, especially the one who try to make the software for designers, are
concentrating to add a CFD engines to their tools. I don't know why but
maybe because the CFD simulation is more fashionable or the results are more
pretty! ;). I think we should strike a balance, and concentrate on WHAT CAN
BE MORE EFFECTIVE rather than WHAT THE MARKET TENDS TO. Hearing about new
software such as NATVENT made a great hope to me, but after reading the
related pages in the ibpsaNEWS, I wonder if it will support DIFFERENT DESIGN
STRATEGIES or it is just designed to support some TYPICAL CASES?!

Best,

Mostapha Sadeghipour

Hi Mark et al,

Sorry to take while getting back to you, this required a little 
investigation. The eQUEST team is busily working on the submittal for 
the 3-63 version of eQUEST an official version which is scheduled to be 
released soon. This will not mean that the previous versions of eQUEST 
will be approved for use for EPAct, however, so it would be good to know 
what version of eQUEST people are using most often. If anyone is 
interested in moving this forward send me an email and let me know what 
version you are using. Feel free to send it to me at gems at spiritone.com 
so this site doesn't get inundated with responses.

Carol,

I removed your cc: list and most of the email chain to save on
space/spam.

I had a couple follow up questions that I was hoping someone could
answer.  It was interesting to read that Owners do not actually have to
submit ANYTHING when they take this tax credit.  The documentation for
EPAct mentions that the Owner just needs to keep the long list of
documentation requirements for any future reference (tax audit?).  With
that in mind:

1)  Has anyone ever had a client who DID get requested by the IRS to
submit the EPAct documentation?
2)  Those that have:  were you ever called out for incorrectly using
eQuest?
3)  Has anyone ever had luck claiming that eQuest is simply a GUI to
manipulate DOE2.1 code (particularly those of us that still do a lot of
the programming in notepad)?

Hope you don't mind me tagging onto your email to ask these questions.
And I hope it doesn't look like I'm trying to "swindle" the Federal
Government by using eQuest.  I'm just curious how in depth the review is
for EPAct.  If building Owners can save tens of thousands of dollars a
year, it would seem to be in the Federal Government's best interest to
review carefully.

Oh, and FWIW, I use v3.61

Hi Mark et al,

Sorry to take while getting back to you, this required a little 
investigation. The eQUEST team is busily working on the submittal for 
the 3-63 version of eQUEST an official version which is scheduled to be 
released soon. This will not mean that the previous versions of eQUEST 
will be approved for use for EPAct, however, so it would be good to know

what version of eQUEST people are using most often. If anyone is 
interested in moving this forward send me an email and let me know what 
version you are using. Feel free to send it to me at gems at spiritone.com 
so this site doesn't get inundated with responses.

Thank you all for the replies and suggestions!

The idea is to support the design process by using multiple tools for
different purposes. For instance, I believe that ECOTECT is probably
the best tool for sun path and shading design. However, I am also
aware of the limitations of this software regarding thermal
calculations. So, in order to take more accurate results, I use
another tool for these calculations (Normally I would use
DesignBuilder for thermal-energy analysis and ECOTECT for solar
simulations). The same logic works for several purposes, like climate
analysis, CFD calculations, etc.

My research not only intends to apply multiple simulation tools in
design but it assumes that there is a better way of using these tools
in a design process. I believe that simplifying models considering
aspects like the information available at the moment, the specific
decisions that you want to support and the reservoir of design
precedents concerning these specific decisions would lead to a more
?designerly? way of simulating.


Best regards,
Raoni

Hi all,

I am working on a mixed use building with retail on the street level.
The store front glazing is clear glass with about 70% window wall ratio
at the street facing face. Being a small building this is an unavoidable
penalty. Does the exception for street level glazing (EXCEPTION
5.5.4.4.1) applicable to Appendix G. Does any one know of a CIR in this
regard?

The exception to the prescriptive building description under chapter 5
allows for street level glazing to be 75%.

Many Thanks,

Minu

Dear List Members,

I would appreciate suggestions on the following project:

We are working on a multi-block residential housing in a topography will hills and valleys (max inclination around 10 degrees). We would like to place the buildings in this topography so that even the first floors receive sunlight for at least a few hours on 21 December. We are looking for software to help us with locating and orientating the buildings so that individual buildings do not block each other from receiving irradiation in this manner.

Kind regards.

Hi all,

 

I am also currently working with IES-VE for LEED energy modeling. I am
finding it very efficient to compute the loads on the project I am working
on, which is quite huge and relatively complex in terms of
geometry/envelope.

However, it gets harder to model the water chilling plant as required by
Appendix G, and I am actually doing this part of the modelling with my own
excel calculation sheets and with DOE-2 curves. 

I was wondering; how will this approach be received by the USGBC? Could they
possibly require that the whole modeling is carried out with a single
package? Has anyone had problems validating EA1 with part of the energy
modelling being external to the simulation tool?

 

I have also been thinking of somehow using EnergyPlus or eQuest (preferably
the latter) just for the water chilling plant modeling. Has anyone ever used
one of these two tools to compute the systems energy from a cooling demand
calculated in an other simulation package?

 

Regards

Mathieu Le Bourhis

I tried out IES-VE a few months or a year ago with some people because the
potential for this type of integration seemed very exciting.  However, we
found the HVAC side to be pretty basic.  For a lot of building types, there
are significant savings to be had by changing HVAC control schemes and/or
configurations and using HVAC types that were not well-represented in IES-VE
the last time I saw it.  It seemed like a great interface to use if you were
trying to design a building to use minimal energy due to envelope,
orientation, natural ventilation, etc.  In other words, it seems strong on
the loads calculation side.  On the system use side, though, it seemed a lot
more limited than DOE2 or EnergyPlus.  For that reason, I have also stuck
with the multiple-tools method.  I agree with all who wrote that it would be
wonderful to have one integrated tool in the future!  Rob does bring up an
interesting point about the resolution of spaces needed for daylighting vs.
thermal vs. architectural modeling.  Architects especially have to be so
detailed in their models that I?ve often just ended up using the floor plans
they provided, deleting a bunch of elements out of those, and scaling wall
heights and windows.  Other than that, their 3D models only serve to help me
visualize the building myself.  It would be nice if we didn?t end up
tripling the effort like we all do now, but so far I don?t see a great way
around it (unless you don?t need complex system modeling ? then you could
use IES-VE as discussed below).

Actually, I'm utilising IES to do HVAC design, Energy Analysis, PMV calc,
lighting lux design, lighting power intensity design and natural daylight
analysis all in line with the Australian Standards and Green Star (another
form of LEED) requirements. 

 

Although the software costs money, I've found it to be worthwhile battling
against it's flaws and it gives us the results which we require. 

 

Please note, this is a one model approach. It's easy to start a project at
CD (concept design) stage within Google Sketchup and to utilise the freeware
version of IES to do alternate design analysis. However, it's way better if
the full suite is purchases and the model is crossed over into IES. Within
IES multiple analysis and detailed designs can be modelled quickly and with
fantastic final project results. I know, I've done it.

 

Also with the daylight analysis, if you've got a detailed building with over
100000 surfaces, it's going to take forever to do the analysis, that's my
only issue with the software. However, the software is developing
multithreading facility within it's software, therefore decreasing the time
for analysis dramatically.

 

Should anyone want to discuss my approaches further, and are in Brisbane, I
welcome the opportunity to meet and greet with you.

Amen brother!  Another issue is that while the energy model has to include

As mentioned in a recent thread on this list, Thomas Bleicher's "su2rad"

theory, these three components (SketchUp, su2rad and the E+ plugin) allow
for a "single model" approach to energy and daylight modeling. However,
because the su2rad exporter wants to take the entire model and create a
single Radiance scene description, that creates the aforementioned problem
of the ambient calculation getting out of hand fairly quickly.  I suppose
through intelligent layering and model structuring, one could create a model
that could be exported to Radiance in "space components", but I'm not sure
if this is compatible with the E+ plugin's layering/model organization

Omer,
 
Google SketchUp. It's free, easy to use, and has a reasonably good
sun/shadow rendering that allows you to see the effects as you change
the date and time. You can get fancier with something like Ecotect and
its sun path diagrams, but for a task like this I'd just go with
SketchUp.

USGBC does allow calculations outside the model for end uses which do not
impact other end uses such as exterior lighting or domestic hot water.  If
the cooling central plant can be completely isolated and you can demonstrate
that the loads placed on it are exactly the same in both models then it may
be allowed.  In order to do this with a high degree of accuracy you may have
to build virtually the same model in both versions of the software.  You
would also need to very thoroughly explain your modeling procedures and
calculations.  By the time you did all that my guess is that you would be
better off just submitting the whole model in eQUEST instead of justifying
the combination.

 

So as a LEED reviewer I would be highly skeptical of the scenario you
suggest and would likely scrutinize it to a significantly higher degree
compared to all calculations in one model.  As I understand it IES-VE does
not yet model water cooled systems very well so I might suggest that it is
simply not an appropriate modeling tool to use for this particular project.

Zhoulun,

I tottally agree with you, even though I still think that CFD calculations
can be very useful in early and detailing stages of design (in terms of
natural ventilation, air pressure and HVAC insuflation).

What I usually do to consider thermal aspects of ventilation in the energy
model is to calculate heat losses due to natural ventilation and air changes
per hour (I leave in Brazil so...is pretty hot here most time of the year)
in DesignBuilder. However I think you are mentioning something more
sophisticated than that.

In terms of time requirements for these simulations...well that's a problem,
because in design you usually need quick answers to your problems. However,
I still think that this time can be reduced if the models are effectively
simplified in order to overcome specific design dilemmas.

Thank you for your comments,
Raoni

Hi,
Does anyone have experience modeling SCR controllers for electric reheat in Trace?
I've tried a couple things but have not been able to accomplish it successfully yet.
If anyone has done this successfully or has suggestions on how to do it well, please let me know.

Thanks in advance for your feedback.

I may have overlooked something, but did all the replies make it to the 
list?

I'd also be interested in the conversation, as I teach architectural 
design modeling at the TU Berlin
and very much have the same quesitons as Raoni. If you could please 
forward to this list any message pertaining
to the subject but didn't make it to the list, I'd be delighted.

On a sidenote, I find it peculiarly interesting that applications for 
handling digital architectural geometry in the design
process, i.e. Rhino, Maya, 3dsMax etc., appear to be far more "user 
friendly" and geared towards their employment
right in the process of design than building energy simulation tools. 
But my experiences are rather limited in
this field, I must profess.

But perhaps we will see a greater integration in the future, i.e. the 
validated lighting model in 3ds max, interactive
shading in sketchup (and hopefully in the upcoming version of Rhino) 
already point to the right direction.

"I believe that simplifying models considering
aspects like the information available at the moment, the specific
decisions that you want to support and the reservoir of design
precedents concerning these specific decisions would lead to a more
?designerly? way of simulating."

I think you are spot-on there, Raoni, and am intrigued by your thinking about 
the subject matter. I try to implement in my teaching a related paradigm of
media literacy that intends to question the nature of different representational 
and explorative digital models. For what purpose is what kind of model created at
what point in the "design timeline"? 

I'd love to hear more about your understanding of model purpose, nature and specificity.

Message-ID: <9C0B01965ADD144D9F09E69ABADF12118AAB7D@DELL.etcgrp.com>

  

We're working on a building that has a large natatorium.

The project is located in Utah so we can use outside air for
dehumidification.  There is no mechanical cooling in the as-designed
system.

 

Per Appendix G, it appears that the baseline system should be a packaged
single zone unit with a fossil fuel furnace for heating, an air side
economizer (dry bulb high limit of 75 F), and DX cooling.  We're
controlling the space temp at 88 F and the relative humidity between
40-60%.  The baseline system would run as a constant volume unit with a
minimum ventilation air requirement of 0.5 cfm/sf (~15,000 cfm).   

The Appendix G baseline system has a considerable dehumidification load
- which shows up as a cooling energy.

 

The as designed system is a heating only unit with an air side
economizer and heat recovery.  The system uses outside air to dehumidify
instead of a DX coil (Utah has a very dry climate).  Space conditions
remain the same.  We've modeled this system by increasing the amount of
ventilation air delivered to the space until the relative humidity in
the space is between roughly 40 and 60%. 

 

The results show a large electric fan penalty (due to the pressure drop
across the heat recovery), a large amount of heating savings (from the
heat recovery), and a large amount of cooling savings, since we're now
using OA, heat recovery and natural gas to dehumidify the space instead
of electricity.

 

Is this a reasonable approach per the Appendix G modeling methodology?
It seems unreasonable to us that we should be able to claim the
cooling/dehumidification savings, but per Appendix G this seems to be
the case.  I would welcome any and all thoughts and feedback.

 

Thanks.

Greg,
 
I think you need to add DX cooling to your proposed design, and energy
recovery to your baseline. Table G3.1 10.(d) states that, "where no
cooling system exists or no cooling system has been specified, the
[proposed] cooling system shall be identical to the system modeled in
the baseline building design." See G3.1.2.10 Exhaust Air Energy Recovery
to determine if it is required or not. I believe you meet the 5000 cfm
supply air and 70% OA criteria. Make sure none of the exceptions apply.

Hi, Max.

When I talk about a designerly way of simulating (or modeling, if you will)
I refer to all those moments in design when you have some sort of dilemma
but you don?t have all information available. I mean, it could be
counterproductive to simulate just a detailed model, couldn?t? You might
identify several mistakes that could be avoided otherwise.

Simulating during design process (it can be even in early stages), the
modeling task becomes rather abstract and incomplete (in comparison to
whole-building simulation). However, design dilemmas can be supported
effectively even with incomplete and simplified models.  Indeed, what you
need is a rough picture of what is going on with each alternative. Actually,
this procedure isn?t something new?I am sure that many modelers do that.
However, to do that in a designerly way you must think like a designer. In
short, I believe you must not only face these design dilemmas in a holistic
way, but you must use properly you episodic knowledge (part of it you can
just call design precedents). That is different when you hire a consultant
to make these simulations.

When I talk about modeling, I am much more concerned with thermal and energy
simulation. However, this same logic is often applied in representational
modeling supporting design process. In fact, some softwares like
RevitBuilding have mass-modeling features that can be easily transformed in
a building. SketchUp was designed to work that way?in rough modeling to
support design. That is the same principle to support different dilemmas.

I hope I have answered your questions.

Hello Aviruch,

Yes, there are models available for estimating the separate components of direct and diffuse when the horizontal global is known.  An initial question on this would be: did you do measurements of hourly values or daily?  I have a rudimentary model that I am willing to share with you that separates hourly global into direct and horizontal diffuse.  (The algorithms are written in BASIC and FORTRAN.)  Some recent work on this has also been done by the ASHRAE technical committee (TC-4.2, Climatic Information) that you can likely get access to.

On the second question, because all solar radiation will impact a building's energy consumption, it will also be a noticeable factor in the building's energy simulation results.  You should be seeing effects on both cooling and heating loads, or, if you are examining strictly passive measures, you should be seeing effects on the building's internal temperatures.

Regards,

LOD

Aviruch,

There are a number of models that estimate the split between direct and
diffuse radiation, mostly based on the KT (ratio of the global radiation
to the extraterrestrial radiation).  The simplest and perhaps easiest to
use model assumes a Gompertz function. Attached is a paper by a
colleague of mine who's applied this model to measured data for Asian
locations.

Dear Larry,

Thank you for the reply.
Yes, we measured the hourly global horizontal radiation for a year. It would be so great if you can share the algorithms developed. We will also go through the information which ASHRAE is providing in this regard.

We took a existing weather file and we changed the global horizontal radiation value (also tried with an option making this value zero through out the data) and used this modified weather file to run a model in Designbuilder and Energyplus. We couldn't find any affect of global radiation on the energy consumption of the building.(A building with HVAC system) 
Wanted to confirm whether Designbuilder and Energyplus use global radiation value of the weather file in the? the simulation.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] eQuest:  Has Anyone Used DProfiler Yet?
Message-ID: <5E2B69FC25C04ED49C42B21EB38B4FD6@Studer>

Hello,

 

I am wondering whether or not anyone out there has used DProfiler yet as a
geometry generation tool for eQuest models?  I know the program is an input
for the SD and DD wizards; it would be handy to be able to quickly enter the
geometry of a building using a program such as DProfiler then use detailed
mode to fine tune the systems.  The program also provides rough estimates of
cost implications associated with different design options using RS Means.

 

I have done a quick review of the program and found the greatest drawback to
my approach described above is that DProfiler overwrites many default values
with specific inputs rather than entering 'user defined defaults'.  As a
result, making changes in the detailed edit mode can take almost as much
time as entering the geometry our standard way.

 

Has anyone else used this program yet?

Thanks,

 

Eric

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Dual Duct Cold Deck Trouble
Message-ID: <49C75FEF.E70E.0034.0@aeieng.com>

Hello,

I'm having trouble modeling an existing dual duct HVAC air system with eQuest.  My existing dual duct system has two supply fans, one for the hot deck and one for the cold deck and they are blow-through type.

The trouble is with the cold deck and the economizer control, and I'm noticing this problem by reviewing the hourly reports of my airside system.  My existing air system has all of the ventilation/economizer air located on the cold deck side.  My cold deck is programmed to discharge a constant temperature of 55 F.  This works fine whenever the outside air temperature is above 50 F.  However, when outside air temperature is below 55 F my economizer control goes bezerk.  Anytime the outside air is below 40 F, my economizer brings in 100% outside air.  So, in essence my cold deck supply temperature is whatever the outside air temperature is.  If the outside air temperature is between 40 F and 50 F it doesn't bring in 100% outside air, but it brings in much more outside air than is necessary to keep the cold deck at 55 F.

FYI, the problem isn't one of the following:

1.)  My ventilation air requirements aren't causing the problem.  If I turn off the economizer, on my energy model, the outside air percentage is fixed and the model runs correctly.  Except for the fact that my cooling coil is now cooling when the economizer should be operating.

2.)  My economizer is a dual-enthalpy type, but I've tried other types of economizers.  They all have the same issue.

3.)  My supply fan motor heat isn't causing the economizer to pull in more outside air than is necessary.  In other words, my economizer isn't trying to compensate for an obscene large fan motor heat by blending down the mixed air temperature.  I've checked my fan motor heat.  It is only contributing 1-3 degrees of heat.

Does anyone know what is wrong?  Any help is greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,

Outside air volume in 62.1 is a function of area, occupant density, and system.   If your area, system, and OA volume are all fixed parameters, it would seem all you can do is solve for occupant density.

Regarding the modeling of water-cooled chillers, chilled water loops, and HVAC systems in IES <Virtual Environment>:

 

In response to user demand, IES is expanding the capability for HVAC systems modeling within IES <Virtual Environment> to more thoroughly represent both conventional and unconventional HVAC systems. 

 

While not yet publically released or announced, in-depth capability for modeling water-cooled chillers and chilled water loops within the IES <Virtual Environment> ApacheHVAC application has been developed and implemented. This capability is presently undergoing testing and will be available in the next release later this spring. 

 

The new water-cooled chiller model is described by three performance curves: 

1)      varies cooling capacity with entering condenser water temperature

2)      varies electric input ratio (EIR) with chilled water temperature

3)      varies electric input ratio (EIR) with part-load fraction. 

 

These scalable performance curves are pre-defined for common chiller types: screw; centrifugal (hermetic, with or without VSD, and open); and reciprocating (hermetic and open). Where water flow is variable, performance curves are provided for pumps. These include constant-speed/variable-flow "riding the pump curve" and electronically commutated variable speed. For expert users, parameter values are editable in the equations describing the performance curves for chillers and pumps. 

 

In addition to selecting appropriate performance curves, the user is able to specify interconnected performance inputs for capacity, COP, condenser and chilled water temperatures, flow rates, and loop delta-T at both rated and design conditions. An input is provided for the load fraction below which the chiller will cycle on and off. The user also has control of operating parameters such as condenser-water setpoint and variation of this setpoint via a formula profile (which may reference outdoor or indoor conditions and other sensed variables), chilled supply water temperature (SWT), and ramped SWT reset between high and low outdoor temperature setpoints. 

 

The cooling tower and condenser-water loop use essentially the same cooling tower model that is provided for the waterside economizer component in the current version of ApacheHVAC. The cooling tower model presently includes a two-speed fan with flow fraction setting for each speed, approach, range, and electric input ratio. This tower and condenser-water loop model accounts for changes in outdoor conditions, chiller heat rejection, and user-controlled tower operating parameters as described above. 

 

Primary and secondary chilled water loops are modeled for the first release of this new facility in a PRM-compliant "common pipe" configuration. For this configuration, the primary loop uses a constant-speed pump that operates whenever the chiller is running and the secondary loop with flow controlled to maintain the specified CHW supply temperature and loop delta-T. Either a constant-speed/variable-flow pump riding the pump curve or a variable-speed pump with variable speed drive (VSD) can be specified for the secondary (chilled-water distribution) loop. Cooling coils, chilled ceilings, etc. are then assigned to the secondary loop associated with a particular chiller.

 

The currently available release of the VE uses a simpler model that does provide means of describing the performance of a water-cooled chiller, cooling tower, and pumps in relation to both part-load fraction and outdoor wet-bulb or dry-bulb temperatures. This is presently done via a matrix of user input data points for the chiller COP, condenser-water pump power, cooling tower fan power, and chilled-water pump power. With appropriate inputs, the chiller COP in this simpler exiting model can be thus be varied according to both load fraction and outdoor conditions, while the power for the associated pumps and fans can separately be varied according to load fraction. However, because this simpler model does not use the type of curves that many EnergyPlus and DOE-2 users are accustomed to and does not explicitly model the thermodynamics of the CW, primary CHW, and secondary CHW loops or their controls, the new facilities described above have been developed to do just this.

 

It is worth noting that the USGBC generally supports the selection of the simulation tool that will most accurately represent what the user is attempting to model, while also suitably addressing the 90.1 PRM requirements for the baseline model. This requires a degree of professional judgment and USGBC approval is on a case-by-case basis. For example, one might be attempting to model a novel air handler configuration, such as a DOAS with indirect evaporative cooling, DX dehumidification, and a desiccant wheel regenerated by waste heat from the DX condenser coil, in a building that uses passive chilled beams fed by a water-cooled chiller. In such a case, it may be that the benefits of added detail in modeling the air handler configuration, desiccant wheel, and the combined radiant and convective effects of the passive chilled beams would outweigh certain limitations with respect to other aspects of the system, such as chiller sequencing. Similar professional judgment may need to be exercised to appropriately account for heat transfer mechanisms and system dynamics when modeling a UFAD system, displacement ventilation, double-skin fa?ade, earth tube pre-conditioning, natural ventilation, mixed-mode operation, or highly customized controls. Ultimately the energy modeler has to make an informed selection of the most appropriate tool for the project at hand. 

 

Finally, with regard to the "One Model" topic that started this Bldg-Sim thread, the IES <Virtual Environment> is intended to address the need for an interdisciplinary range of technical analyses within a single, integrated model. In part, this is provided through interoperability with other tools, such as SketchUp, Revit, and other BIMs, thus minimizing and potentially eliminating the need for preparing a separate 3D model. The <VE> also includes a range of applications, several of which were described by users earlier in this thread, for integrated analysis of solar shading, daylight modeling, daylighting controls, thermal mass and dynamic load calculations, natural ventilation, thermal comfort, airflow, IAQ, conventional HVAC systems, building-integrated HVAC systems, etc. The <VE> provides a range of tools for analysis appropriate to each stage of the design process, facilitating both quick, early reduction of building loads followed by detailed investigation of technical opportunities. 

 

Hopefully this helps to clarify the capabilities of the VE for those concerned specifically with modeling HVAC systems and more generally with the "one-model" approach.

USGBC does allow calculations outside the model for end uses which do not impact other end uses such as exterior lighting or domestic hot water.  If the cooling central plant can be completely isolated and you can demonstrate that the loads placed on it are exactly the same in both models then it may be allowed.  In order to do this with a high degree of accuracy you may have to build virtually the same model in both versions of the software.  You would also need to very thoroughly explain your modeling procedures and calculations.  By the time you did all that my guess is that you would be better off just submitting the whole model in eQUEST instead of justifying the combination.

 

So as a LEED reviewer I would be highly skeptical of the scenario you suggest and would likely scrutinize it to a significantly higher degree compared to all calculations in one model.  As I understand it IES-VE does not yet model water cooled systems very well so I might suggest that it is simply not an appropriate modeling tool to use for this particular project.

Hi all,

 

I am also currently working with IES-VE for LEED energy modeling. I am finding it very efficient to compute the loads on the project I am working on, which is quite huge and relatively complex in terms of geometry/envelope.

However, it gets harder to model the water chilling plant as required by Appendix G, and I am actually doing this part of the modelling with my own excel calculation sheets and with DOE-2 curves. 

I was wondering; how will this approach be received by the USGBC? Could they possibly require that the whole modeling is carried out with a single package? Has anyone had problems validating EA1 with part of the energy modelling being external to the simulation tool?

 

I have also been thinking of somehow using EnergyPlus or eQuest (preferably the latter) just for the water chilling plant modeling. Has anyone ever used one of these two tools to compute the systems energy from a cooling demand calculated in an other simulation package?

 

Regards

Mathieu Le Bourhis

I tried out IES-VE a few months or a year ago with some people because the potential for this type of integration seemed very exciting.  However, we found the HVAC side to be pretty basic.  For a lot of building types, there are significant savings to be had by changing HVAC control schemes and/or configurations and using HVAC types that were not well-represented in IES-VE the last time I saw it.  It seemed like a great interface to use if you were trying to design a building to use minimal energy due to envelope, orientation, natural ventilation, etc.  In other words, it seems strong on the loads calculation side.  On the system use side, though, it seemed a lot more limited than DOE2 or EnergyPlus.  For that reason, I have also stuck with the multiple-tools method.  I agree with all who wrote that it would be wonderful to have one integrated tool in the future!  Rob does bring up an interesting point about the resolution of spaces needed for daylighting vs. thermal vs. architectural modeling.  Architects especially have to be so detailed in their models that I've often just ended up using the floor plans they provided, deleting a bunch of elements out of those, and scaling wall heights and windows.  Other than that, their 3D models only serve to help me visualize the building myself.  It would be nice if we didn't end up tripling the effort like we all do now, but so far I don't see a great way around it (unless you don't need complex system modeling - then you could use IES-VE as discussed below).

Actually, I'm utilising IES to do HVAC design, Energy Analysis, PMV calc, lighting lux design, lighting power intensity design and natural daylight analysis all in line with the Australian Standards and Green Star (another form of LEED) requirements. 

 

Although the software costs money, I've found it to be worthwhile battling against it's flaws and it gives us the results which we require. 

 

Please note, this is a one model approach. It's easy to start a project at CD (concept design) stage within Google Sketchup and to utilise the freeware version of IES to do alternate design analysis. However, it's way better if the full suite is purchases and the model is crossed over into IES. Within IES multiple analysis and detailed designs can be modelled quickly and with fantastic final project results. I know, I've done it.

 

Also with the daylight analysis, if you've got a detailed building with over 100000 surfaces, it's going to take forever to do the analysis, that's my only issue with the software. However, the software is developing multithreading facility within it's software, therefore decreasing the time for analysis dramatically.

 

Should anyone want to discuss my approaches further, and are in Brisbane, I welcome the opportunity to meet and greet with you.

The ultimate goal for us would be to use one model for daylight and energy models, but I haven't found that quite that simple as most software requires varying drawing techniques.

 

Amen brother!  Another issue is that while the energy model has to include the total building -- all spaces and systems -- to be a complete picture of the energy use, a Radiance-based daylight model does not necessarily require all the spaces to be modeled simultaneously.  Indeed, the accuracy of the ambient calculation is directly affected by the maximum size of the scene, and so conducting a simultaneous daylight simulation of an entire building at an acceptably rigorous ambient resolution can be -- is generally -- time-prohibitive.

 

As mentioned in a recent thread on this list, Thomas Bleicher's "su2rad" plugin for SketchUp can export a SU model to Radiance format and there is also an E+ plugin to allow one to use the same SU model for E+ analysis; in theory, these three components (SketchUp, su2rad and the E+ plugin) allow for a "single model" approach to energy and daylight modeling. However, because the su2rad exporter wants to take the entire model and create a single Radiance scene description, that creates the aforementioned problem of the ambient calculation getting out of hand fairly quickly.  I suppose through intelligent layering and model structuring, one could create a model that could be exported to Radiance in "space components", but I'm not sure if this is compatible with the E+ plugin's layering/model organization requirements.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Unmet load hours
Message-ID: <002b01c9acc7$37cb75c0$a7626140$@benayed@eb-engineers.com>

Dear all,

 

Appendix G states that the unmet load hours of for the proposed design or
the baseline design shall not exceed 300 (of the 8760 hours simulated) and
unmet load hours for the proposed design shall not exceed the unmet load
hours for the baseline building design by more than 50. 

Suppose I have the following unmet load hours' results: 

(Base Heating = 21     ; Base Cooling = 196) Total Base = 217 Hrs < 300 Hrs

(Design Heating = 96 ; Design Cooling = 96) Total Design = 192 Hrs < 300 Hrs

And Total Base - Total Design = 217 - 192 = 25 < 50 Hrs

 

I believe that my results fulfill Appendix G requirements but I just got a
little confused because the LEED template is not calculating the total unmet
load hours but instead the difference between base/design cooling and
base/design heating. I would appreciate it if you could share your thoughts
on this.

 

Thank you for your input,

 

Anis

Dear Bldg-Sim users,

 

In DOE2 , have any users come across major differences between building
peak cooling loads (in the LS-D reports) and the maximum cooling loads
listed in the SS-D reports?

I'm troubleshooting equipment sizing in a DOE2 model and I'm trying nail
down some reasonable explanations for the disparities in the loads. 

I would appreciate any words of wisdom.

Whoa!

Hugh differences by design!

LOADS reports are just that...space heating and cooling loads plus assigned electric loads, which includes occupants, schedules, etc. All at constant thermostat temps for each SPACE.

SYSTEM loads are the loads on the air-side systems, which are system dependent, and include ventilation loads, exhaust fans, thermostats, economizers, etc.

PLANT adds yet another layer of equipment, etc.

Therefore, values from SYSTEMS or PLANT are best used for sizing depending on system type.

Thanks Jeff, that?s I good point. I appreciate your summary of the differences between those report types.

In my particular case the ?major? differences I?ve encountered between LOAD and SYSTEM were much larger than what?s reasonable for ventilation/exhaust/economizer.

Any thoughts?

SP Henry,

Ah the "DOE-2 blues" on a dreary day in March...

If you are looking at peak loads, I suggest looking at when (month, date, and time) the load and system peaks occur in the model.
How different are they from each other?
Are they intuitive?
Do they coincide with a "step" change in the input schedules?
What is the weather file doing then? There are some bad ones out there.
etc...

Good luck,
Paul Riemer

I posted an ASHRAE 62.1 question to this list a few days ago.  I have 
made a lot of progress since then, but there are still a few nagging 
questions.  I know that ASHRAE 62.1 is not a primary focus of this list, 
but I hope that some of you LEED gurus out there will help me out.

Basically I am looking to find out if population diversity can be used, 
across the board, to reduce the system outside air requirements in 62.1 
and if you can do that, how do you document room-by-room compliance as 
required by LEED Existing Building requirements?  My thoughts right now 
are to use population diversity to reduce the entire system OA 
requirement, but to check that every room with only one person gets the 
required OA allotment.

This is perhaps more strict than necessary.

All ideas are welcome, but if somebody is an ASHRAE 62.2 guru, I 'd love 
to correspond off-list on this.

Cheers!

We have a fully funded opening for a PhD researcher at Eindhoven University of Technology.

The title of the project is "Towards E+ steel-frame industrial hall: simulation support for objective prediction of energy in use". The aim is to enable an objective sustainability assessment of industrial halls and to expand building energy simulation tools with models for new construction materials, system components and possible system configurations to account for the industrial hall construction specifics, process energy production and on-site electricity generation.

Further details are available at http://www.m2i.nl/pro1/general/start.asp?i=0&j=0&k=0&p=0&itemid=387

Please don't hesitate to contact me for further information.

I would appreciate it very much if you could pass this message to suitable candidates.

Thanks!
Jan

This does not seem ready for real use.  We tried it and is very
simplistic and does not seem to give functionality.  It seems to do
little more than plot points in model, but not analyze model.  The
internal SketchUp tools will do more than SunTools.

Message-ID: <1ed6bcd10903261212s90c5c31y8eef164f97b9e2e9@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,
   I was curious if anyone has a program or excel program that models the
fan energy and pumping energy of cooling towers. I currently use IES-VE,
which does not have any cooling tower capabilities (to my knowledge), so I
end up calculating the fan and pump energy for the cooling towers in a crude
excel sheet. Does anyone have a better way to do this that takes into
account the air WB temp, load of the building, and size of fan? Thanks for
the help!

For those of you who missed the post the other day regarding modeling of
water-cooled chillers, chilled water loops, and HVAC systems more
generally in IES <Virtual Environment> (see "One Model" discussion
thread just a couple days ago), the following excerpt duplicates the
text from that post regarding water-cooled chillers, chilled water
loops. The discussion of currently offered capability along these lines
follows the description of the development that is soon to be released.

 

***

 

Regarding the modeling of water-cooled chillers, chilled water loops,
and HVAC systems in IES <Virtual Environment>:

 

While not yet publically released or announced, in-depth capability for
modeling water-cooled chillers and chilled water loops within the IES
<Virtual Environment> ApacheHVAC application has been developed and
implemented. This capability is presently undergoing testing and will be
available in the next release later this spring. 

 

The new water-cooled chiller model is described by three performance
curves: 

1)      varies cooling capacity with entering condenser water
temperature

2)      varies electric input ratio (EIR) with chilled water temperature

3)      varies electric input ratio (EIR) with part-load fraction. 

 

These scalable performance curves are pre-defined for common chiller
types: screw; centrifugal (hermetic, with or without VSD, and open); and
reciprocating (hermetic and open). Where water flow is variable,
performance curves are provided for pumps. These include
constant-speed/variable-flow "riding the pump curve" and electronically
commutated variable speed. For expert users, parameter values are
editable in the equations describing the performance curves for chillers
and pumps. 

 

In addition to selecting appropriate performance curves, the user is
able to specify interconnected performance inputs for capacity, COP,
condenser and chilled water temperatures, flow rates, and loop delta-T
at both rated and design conditions. An input is provided for the load
fraction below which the chiller will cycle on and off. The user also
has control of operating parameters such as condenser-water setpoint and
variation of this setpoint via a formula profile (which may reference
outdoor or indoor conditions and other sensed variables), chilled supply
water temperature (SWT), and ramped SWT reset between high and low
outdoor temperature setpoints. 

 

The cooling tower and condenser-water loop use essentially the same
cooling tower model that is provided for the waterside economizer
component in the current version of ApacheHVAC. The cooling tower model
presently includes a two-speed fan with flow fraction setting for each
speed, approach, range, and electric input ratio. This tower and
condenser-water loop model accounts for changes in outdoor conditions,
chiller heat rejection, and user-controlled tower operating parameters
as described above. 

 

Primary and secondary chilled water loops are modeled for the first
release of this new facility in a PRM-compliant "common pipe"
configuration. For this configuration, the primary loop uses a
constant-speed pump that operates whenever the chiller is running and
the secondary loop with flow controlled to maintain the specified CHW
supply temperature and loop delta-T. Either a
constant-speed/variable-flow pump riding the pump curve or a
variable-speed pump with variable speed drive (VSD) can be specified for
the secondary (chilled-water distribution) loop. Cooling coils, chilled
ceilings, etc. are then assigned to the secondary loop associated with a
particular chiller.

 

The currently available release of the VE uses a simpler model that does
provide means of describing the performance of a water-cooled chiller,
cooling tower, and pumps in relation to both part-load fraction and
outdoor wet-bulb or dry-bulb temperatures. This is presently done via a
matrix of user input data points for the chiller COP, condenser-water
pump power, cooling tower fan power, and chilled-water pump power. With
appropriate inputs, the chiller COP in this simpler exiting model can be
thus be varied according to both load fraction and outdoor conditions,
while the power for the associated pumps and fans can separately be
varied according to load fraction. However, because this simpler model
does not use the type of curves that many EnergyPlus and DOE-2 users are
accustomed to and does not explicitly model the thermodynamics of the
CW, primary CHW, and secondary CHW loops or their controls, the new
facilities described above have been developed to do just this.

 

Hopefully this helps to clarify the current and near-term capabilities
of the VE for those concerned specifically with modeling HVAC systems.

Hello everyone,

   I was curious if anyone has a program or excel program that models
the fan energy and pumping energy of cooling towers. I currently use
IES-VE, which does not have any cooling tower capabilities (to my
knowledge), so I end up calculating the fan and pump energy for the
cooling towers in a crude excel sheet. Does anyone have a better way to
do this that takes into account the air WB temp, load of the building,
and size of fan? Thanks for the help!

We have a fully funded opening for a PhD researcher at Eindhoven
University of Technology.

The title of the project is "Towards E+ steel-frame industrial hall:
simulation support for objective prediction of energy in use". The aim
is to enable an objective sustainability assessment of industrial halls
and to expand building energy simulation tools with models for new
construction materials, system components and possible system
configurations to account for the industrial hall construction
specifics, process energy production and on-site electricity generation.

Further details are available at 
http://www.m2i.nl/pro1/general/start.asp?i=0&j=0&k=0&p=0&itemid=387

Please don't hesitate to contact me for further information.

I would appreciate it very much if you could pass this message to
suitable candidates.

Thanks!

This does not seem ready for real use.  We tried it and is very
simplistic and does not seem to give functionality.  It seems to do
little more than plot points in model, but not analyze model.  The
internal SketchUp tools will do more than SunTools.

Actually Mark, I think the tool shows quite a bit of promise.  The  
readme clearly states that several features are works in progress or  
yet to be implemented, but some of the stuff in there is already  
useful, and definitely not part of the "internal SketchUp tools". The  
sun path visualizations are nice, and the views from the sun  
perspective are also useful.  From a shading study perspective, these  
tools are useful right now. I guess it all depends on what you call  
"analysis".  No, the tools do not calculate energy savings from  
shading devices, but they do illustrate very well the issues around a  
particular fenestration.  You can clearly see the range of time where  
direct sun is a problem, and the best part is, with this presentation  
a client can see the issues too. Our internal tools where I work are  
faster to use, but aren't all that great at illustrating the issues to  
the client. I think this presentation is very clear (and is also the  
way Ecotect presents this info).

Guedi, a couple of comments: can you provide the plugin as a set of  
files instead of a windows installer, so I can install the plugin on a  
Mac too?  Also, it'd be nice if the sun objects are placed on a  
separate pre-defined layer instead of the current layer, just for  
organizational purposes.

SunTools is not a "simulation" program; in fact there are almost no
calculations in it.  I started working on it during a sabbatical leave at
LBNL, and we discussed with colleagues there the idea of exploring how you
can present "existing" internal data, in a new, meaningful way, all in the
same program and model. Sun Position is internal SU data; the question is if
the visualization of this data is valuable, for students, architects and
clients during design.. 

Sunviews can be understood as a different representation of shadow casting;
however you can use them to understand also the cause of shading in you
facades, solar systems or open spaces, difficult to do see with regular
shadow casting in complex environments. With the Sun penetration analysis
tool, you can see in one single view a full range of information, valuable
for design. The majority of these features are already available in
different ways and packages, but again the idea was bringing all this
information at any design stage into one tool that architects use at the
same moment that they work with the model in SU.

 

Rob, I'll implement your suggestion of a special layer for the sun objects,
thanks! Regarding the Mac, it is not a problem; I can put the files in a zip
format for downloading if you want to give them a try in a Mac. However,
I'll need to cancel the automatic saving of sunview pictures, to avoid
problems with file paths.

Actually Mark, I think the tool shows quite a bit of promise.  The readme
clearly states that several features are works in progress or yet to be
implemented, but some of the stuff in there is already useful, and
definitely not part of the "internal SketchUp tools". The sun path
visualizations are nice, and the views from the sun perspective are also
useful.  From a shading study perspective, these tools are useful right now.
I guess it all depends on what you call "analysis".  No, the tools do not
calculate energy savings from shading devices, but they do illustrate very
well the issues around a particular fenestration.  You can clearly see the
range of time where direct sun is a problem, and the best part is, with this
presentation a client can see the issues too. Our internal tools where I
work are faster to use, but aren't all that great at illustrating the issues
to the client. I think this presentation is very clear (and is also the way
Ecotect presents this info). 

 

Guedi, a couple of comments: can you provide the plugin as a set of files
instead of a windows installer, so I can install the plugin on a Mac too?
Also, it'd be nice if the sun objects are placed on a separate pre-defined
layer instead of the current layer, just for organizational purposes.

Guedi,

Yes it is useful, we have already used it to do exactly as you say,
visually see the shading impacts of, in our case the shading of an
extended curtain wall mullion/roller shade to help inform the design,
and prevent a potential glaring light streak across rows of desks.

Robert,

I haven't seen any replies to your Std. 62.1 question, so I'll assume you're
still wondering.  

The standard calculation of the required outdoor air (OA) amount already
includes population diversity, which typically reduces the total OA
required.  So, to your question:  yes, diversity can be used to reduce
system OA requirements (and is a normal part of the Std. 62.1 calculation).
Diversity is calculated with equation 6-7, and it's factored into the total
uncorrected OA intake amount in equation 6-6 (referencing 62.1-2007).

If you're correctly using the standard for a system that serves multiple
zones and uses some recirculated air, you will have calculated which zone is
the critical zone: the that zone needs the greatest fraction of primary air
at the ventilation design condition.  (Note that the ventilation design
condition is not the cooling or heating design condition, necessarily).  The
critical zone drives the total OA requirement.  All other zones
automatically get the required OA allotment or more.  

To know which zone is the critical zone, look at Appendix A.  There's a
section called "Selecting Zones for Calculation".

To your comment "every room with only one person gets the required OA
allotment", note that every zone has a population AND an area component to
the required OA.  

There are ways to meet the standard and reduce the total OA required.  These
generally involve changing the critical zone until it becomes non-critical
(the next most ventilation intensive zone becomes the critical zone).  This
can be done with a transfer air fan (bringing air from an over-ventilated
zone to reduce the required primary air in the critical zone), or by
increasing the minimum VAV flow setting on the critical zone (this zone may
use more reheat energy, but this can be offset by the cooling energy saved
by reducing the total OA, for example).  It depends on your particular case.

If that doesn't answer your questions, feel free to email me off-list.

I posted an ASHRAE 62.1 question to this list a few days ago.  I have 
made a lot of progress since then, but there are still a few nagging 
questions.  I know that ASHRAE 62.1 is not a primary focus of this list, 
but I hope that some of you LEED gurus out there will help me out.

Basically I am looking to find out if population diversity can be used, 
across the board, to reduce the system outside air requirements in 62.1 
and if you can do that, how do you document room-by-room compliance as 
required by LEED Existing Building requirements?  My thoughts right now 
are to use population diversity to reduce the entire system OA 
requirement, but to check that every room with only one person gets the 
required OA allotment.

This is perhaps more strict than necessary.

All ideas are welcome, but if somebody is an ASHRAE 62.2 guru, I 'd love 
to correspond off-list on this.

Cheers!

Message-ID: <01a801c9af0d$1e194ce0$5a4be6a0$@com>

Has anyone had any success in predicting the energy savings for a
runaround water loop for heat recovery?  I've done some google'ing and
found a couple references to ClimateQuest's Heat Analyzer Tool, but
they're all dated 2005 or earlier and ClimateQuest doesn't seem to be
around anymore.

 

Does anyone have any tips or tools for analyzing this measure?  As far as
I know eQUEST is not capable of this because I'm recovering heat between
two separate airflows that are unequally sized.

 

Any help would be appreciated.

 

Thanks,

Hello everyone,

   I was curious if anyone has a program or excel program that models
the fan energy and pumping energy of cooling towers. I currently use
IES-VE, which does not have any cooling tower capabilities (to my
knowledge), so I end up calculating the fan and pump energy for the
cooling towers in a crude excel sheet. Does anyone have a better way to
do this that takes into account the air WB temp, load of the building,
and size of fan? Thanks for the help!

The title of the project is "Towards E+ steel-frame industrial hall:
simulation support for objective prediction of energy in use". The aim
is to enable an objective sustainability assessment of industrial halls
and to expand building energy simulation tools with models for new
construction materials, system components and possible system
configurations to account for the industrial hall construction
specifics, process energy production and on-site electricity generation.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Heat Recovery with Runaround Loop



Has anyone had any success in predicting the energy savings for a runaround
water loop for heat recovery?  I've done some google'ing and found a couple
references to ClimateQuest's Heat Analyzer Tool, but they're all dated 2005
or earlier and ClimateQuest doesn't seem to be around anymore.

 

Does anyone have any tips or tools for analyzing this measure?  As far as I
know eQUEST is not capable of this because I'm recovering heat between two
separate airflows that are unequally sized.

 

Any help would be appreciated.

 

Thanks,

Thanks David,

I have learned a lot since I first posted on this topic.

Peter Moberg was nice enough to provide great information and a 
spreadsheet from 62.1: 2004.  I also bought the User's Guide for 62.1: 
2007.  In it there was a spreadsheet that, although it was difficult for 
me to decipher originally, gave a great tool for solving this dilemma.

I had already developed my own spreadsheet, which was much more 
rudimentary than the ASHRAE spreadsheet.  Although my spreadsheet wasn't 
up to snuff, it helped me to understand the issue and to enter the data.

I am still not done with the analysis, but I do believe the I am well on 
my way to understanding the issue and providing a solution.  You are 
quite correct, once the critical zone is identified, changes can be made 
to effect a solution


Thanks for helping me to understand this issue,

	hollow core ceiling - TermoDeck (ventilated hollow core slabs)
	Simulations
Message-ID: <auto-001044636216@mailfe11.swip.net>

Dear Timothy

 

We have tried to model TermoDeck together with IES in UK with the approach
you describe. Unfortunately, the results from IES simulations have differed
from the results we expect to find. There seems to be two major problems
with modelling TermoDeck in this way:

 

1.      The actual air-to-slab heat transfer in a hollow core slab is quite
different from what you get from standard correlations for fully developed
duct flow. 

2.      The vertical conduction through the solid concrete ?walls? between
the cores is significant, also in a situation where both the zone below and
that above have similar conditions. This is because the film coefficients at
the floor and the ceiling will be significantly different. This conduction
process is completely neglected if the core ?walls? are treated as if they
were physical walls of a room. In a 1D model, and as I understand it also in
IES, a vertical wall will only conduct horizontally. As a result, the net
conduction over the TermoDeck slab is severely underestimated.

 

Our proprietary model of TermoDeck will treat both these phenomena with
sufficient accuracy and it has been experimentally validated (including a
test building). It has also been verified with regard to reality in more
than 380 projects world-wide. 

 

We strongly advise consultants and clients to contact us to discuss and
correctly design projects incorporating ventilated hollow core slabs. There
are many aspects involved in these systems that must be carried out
correctly in order to perform properly: Slab customization, Slab layout
configuration, Thermal modelling and Controls. If the controls are not
properly designed the function will not be very good. Our experience tells
us that this is a big concern as our control specifications are not always
implemented correctly.

Timothy,

 

Thanks for the great summary.  Do you know if it's possible to model
Thermodeck in eQuest by tricking the system somehow?  I've bumped up the
thermal mass of the floors, but it's obviously not having as big an impact
as correctly modelling the CFD component.  I had a thought about modelling a
pre-coil to simulate the damping effects of the slab in reducing peaks and
then manually removing that energy, but I'm not sure if this is correct.
Any thoughts?

 

Cheers,

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] IES VE: Radiant, hollow core ceiling

Rebecca and others, 

 

Modeling air-cooled (or heated), hollow-core radiant slabs (such as
TermoDeck) within IES Virtual Environment is a relatively straightforward
matter:

 

1) Include the hollow-core geometry in your model. This must be segmented to
properly capture the changing delta-T over distance as the supply air gains
heat while passing through any sections of the floor cavity that are going
to be in series rather than parallel configurations. 

 

2) If the hollow core is cooled via natural ventilation, then the volume of
the core spaces needs to be coupled to the plenums or zones that include the
operable openings. Like windows or other operable openings in the occupied
spaces, these openings can be controlled via schedules, interior conditions,
climate variables, or formulae including any of these. The coupled MacroFlo
dynamic bulk airflow modler within the VE will need to run whenever natural
ventialtion is to be acconted for, but not if there were no operable windows
and the hollow-coore was to be cooled by mechanically driven supply airflow.


 

In the case of natural ventialtion, you may also wish to use the MicroFlo
CFD tool within the VE to determine the performacne of specific openings,
cavities, or occupied spaces under specific conditons. The bulk airflow
model and thermal simulation are used to set up initial boundary conditions
for the CFD model, and then the results from the CFD run can then inform
revision of the operable openings in the dynamic bulk-airflow + thermal
modeling. While the CFD work can be valuable in determining performance and
refining the model, it is not required to run the dynamic bulk-airflow +
thermal modeling of the naturally ventilated spaces, nor is it required for
modeling the hollow-core floor.

 

3) Apply convective heat transfer coefficients to the interior surfaces of
the hollow-core material constructions appropriate to the use of this core
space as a duct (see ASHRAE Fundamentals for determining appropriate
coefficients). You will need to calculate the equivalent air-film
resistance, as this is the value you will change, replacing the air-film
resistance associated with the default variable coefficient for natural
convection in the Constructions dialog. Then open the Derived Parameters
dialog from there to confirm that the convective heat transfer coefficient
calculated by the VE is what you intended (and thus that you have entered
the correct air-film resistance value). Note also that the bottom surface
construction of the hollow-core ceiling will be applied as the Ceiling
construction for the occupied space below, and therefore the "Outside"
surface air-film resistance for this element will be the one facing the
interior of the hollow core.

 

4) If air-cooling or heating of the hollow core is mechanically driven, set
up the system in ApacheHVAC with the supply air running through the hollow
core geometry as would be done in the actual building. If it is a mixed-mode
system, wherein the cavity is alternately cooled by mechanical supply air
and natural ventilation, then set up the controls such that these modes
hand-off appropriately?i.e., if no overlap is desired, ensure that
controllers for both system include common sensed variable and thresholds,
and non-overlapping responses at these thresholds.

 

IES VE is in fact exceptionally well suited to doing this and provides
appropriate means of controlling such systems and of accounting for the full
range of radiant and convective heat transfer paths involved. 

 

As with any tool, taking the time to first understand how to use the tool
properly is important to getting appropriate results.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] IES VE: Radiant, hollow core ceiling

 

I have a question regarding the capabilities of IES VE and its CFD package
and I was hoping someone might have some experience or insight to help get
me started on the following problem.  We have a concept cooling design which
includes a radiant hollow core concrete ceiling through which evaporatively
cooled air is routed.  The air which is routed through the radiant ceiling
comes from a central evaporative cooler and is then exhausted at the
exterior of each room after it has passed through the airflow passages in
the ceiling.  Just to be clear, this is not a typical radiant system in that
electricity is being used to cool the slab but instead evaporatively cooled
outdoor air is being used in its place.  We also want to couple these
effects with natural ventilation which occurs because of the use of operable
windows.  

We are trying to analyze the effects of these techniques in a cooling season
in Colorado (hence the benefit of the evaporative cooler).  We have
conducted rough calculations of the benefits of using such a system using
standard ASHRAE energy transfer techniques and we want to verify our
results.  Have you ever heard of this type of system being modeled in IES VE
and/or is it capable of modeling such a system?  Is there a way to modify
the "radiant ceiling" option in IES to take into account the saving which
would occur by using evaporatively cooled air in the place of electricity?
If not, is there a way to manually create such a system from the ground up?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.

Hello

I am trying to understand the thermal comfort of the courtyard with varying
proportions, height, glazing (building glazing adjacent to courtyard) in
different climatic zones of India. I want to study the thermal comfort only
till 10 feet height of the courtyard from ground level (average operable
temperature of the courtyard zone till 10 feet height).

So few questions regarding model and simulation tools:
1) Which tool can model and simulate outdoor spaces (courtyard) ?
2) How to make a open courtyard as a zone? Courtyard is a part of building.
3) I need to make a virtual horizontal partition in the courtyard at a
height of 10 feet from ground floor.

I tried some simulation on Design Builder but could not get correct results.

I don't want to use CFD because I am interested in hourly thermal
performance of the courtyard and want to find the comfortable hours
throughout the year. Kindly help me.

Thanks

a ground-to-air heat exchanger using GAEA. You can download a free trial

My question is: How do I import the EAHX simulation results into eQuest?

We have a working knowledge of eQuest and can comfortably run basic

Rachit,

 

When dealing with comfort conditions in passively conditioned spaces,
you're going to have a hard time coming up with accurate models -
especially outdoor conditions. That being said, I think CFD is probably
the best equipped for this. Your hourly analysis program (like E+,
eQUEST etc) use a lumped node method of calculation - so a space (or
thermal zone) will have a single temperature, a wall has a uniform
temperature. In a mechanically conditioned space, this is a reasonable
approximation since most often the air is mixed and not stratified.
However, in passively conditioned spaces, there is often a larger degree
of thermal variation within spaces - in both temperature and MRT, so it
becomes necessary to study it with full-field solution tools like CFD. 

 

One method to overcome the inability to do a 24/365 simulation in cfd is
to create temperature bins from your weather file and run separate
simulations for each bin. You can then approximate how many hours fall
into each bin. In most cases (especially the hotter hours), the
temperature bins will also correspond to times of day, so you might be
able to get away with doing a single sun position for each temp bin.

 

Hope this helps.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Help: Simulation of External Zone_Courtyard

 

Hello 

I am trying to understand the thermal comfort of the courtyard with
varying proportions, height, glazing (building glazing adjacent to
courtyard) in different climatic zones of India. I want to study the
thermal comfort only till 10 feet height of the courtyard from ground
level (average operable temperature of the courtyard zone till 10 feet
height). 

So few questions regarding model and simulation tools: 
1) Which tool can model and simulate outdoor spaces (courtyard) ?
2) How to make a open courtyard as a zone? Courtyard is a part of
building. 
3) I need to make a virtual horizontal partition in the courtyard at a
height of 10 feet from ground floor. 

I tried some simulation on Design Builder but could not get correct
results. 
I don't want to use CFD because I am interested in hourly thermal
performance of the courtyard and want to find the comfortable hours
throughout the year. Kindly help me. 

Thanks 

Rachit

The EAHX has been modeled for a year span with both a spreadsheet and
GAEA. I have searched the bldg-sim listserv archives on modeling EAHXs
in eQuest and read the posts I found. One post from Demba Ndiaye to
Neeraj Kapoor (Mon Jun 23 06:17:09 PDT 2008) stated; "I recently modeled
a ground-to-air heat exchanger using GAEA. You can download a free trial
version at WWW: http://nesa1.uni-siegen.de/. You can import back the
results into eQuest."

My question is: How do I import the EAHX simulation results into eQuest?

We have a working knowledge of eQuest and can comfortably run basic
scenarios, but are not experienced users.

Thanks!

Hello Sir,

Thanks for the reply.
I understand there are certain limitations with the approach because I am
attempting to model an external space using an enclosed zone.
I need few more favors regarding the solution you explained for 24/265
simulation in CFD. I am not very familiar with technicality of tools,
weather files and such stuffs. But I have to go in depth to solve the
problem. So can you please help me out in this? Could you explain me the
programming part and things related to precede this.

I am trying Design Builder CFD tool.


Thanks


Rachit

I echo Rob's comments. I think the intent is to have a quick
visualization tool - something Sketchup doesn't have right now. This is
really good to communicate shading issues with clients and (sadly)
architects who aren't as solar savvy.  The ability to see the sun
positions at various times of the day and year through the window is
very cool - you have the entire year's information at a glance. 

 

The one drawback with that it that the sun positions are only valid
relative to the central focal point of the sun path arc, so you really
need to scale this up large to get realistic results. 

 

I think it's a good tool though - please keep us posted on improvements
to it.

Actually Mark, I think the tool shows quite a bit of promise.  The
readme clearly states that several features are works in progress or yet
to be implemented, but some of the stuff in there is already useful, and
definitely not part of the "internal SketchUp tools". The sun path
visualizations are nice, and the views from the sun perspective are also
useful.  From a shading study perspective, these tools are useful right
now. I guess it all depends on what you call "analysis".  No, the tools
do not calculate energy savings from shading devices, but they do
illustrate very well the issues around a particular fenestration.  You
can clearly see the range of time where direct sun is a problem, and the
best part is, with this presentation a client can see the issues too.
Our internal tools where I work are faster to use, but aren't all that
great at illustrating the issues to the client. I think this
presentation is very clear (and is also the way Ecotect presents this
info). 

 

Guedi, a couple of comments: can you provide the plugin as a set of
files instead of a windows installer, so I can install the plugin on a
Mac too?  Also, it'd be nice if the sun objects are placed on a separate
pre-defined layer instead of the current layer, just for organizational
purposes.
