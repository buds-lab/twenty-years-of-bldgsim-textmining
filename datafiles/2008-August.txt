Tim,

I have the impression that Type 56 in TRNSYS is not a geometrical, but
rather a analytical, representation of buildings, by which I mean that Type
56 does not seem to understand what is the relationship between different
building elements, such as east wall, west wall, window, roof, shading, etc.
Am I right or wrong?

How do you input building definition in TRNSYS?

Thanks,
Chaoqin

I found two references for the process and plug load in warehouses:
1) a PNNL report entitled Development of Advanced Energy Design Guide for
Small Warehouse and Storage Buildings. The value given is 0.35 W/sf.
2) a NREL report entitled Energy Savings Modeling and Inspection Guidelines
for Commercial Building Federal Tax Deductions. The value given is 0.43
W/sf.

So it looks to me ~0.4W/sf is a reasonable number.

Chaoqin,
  There are three parts to the geometry issue.

  For internal radiation exchange, you are correct that TRNSYS is a
non-geometrical model and that two surfaces do not have any knowledge of
their mutual view factor. Like many of the other building models out
there, TRNSYS uses a star-network in which each surface "radiates" to
the air node and vice versa.

  For external geometry, one defines orientations in the building
processor (TRNBuild) and then defines corresponding surfaces (slope and
azimuth) in the weather data reader. Solar radiation from a particular
weather data reader surface is then linked to the appropriate Type56
inputs for each orientation defined in TRNBuild.

  For external shading (including building self-shading), one places a
series of wingwall and overhang components between the unshaded solar
radiation calculated by the weather data reader and the building, in
effect cutting down on the amount of radiation incident on the building.
It is a flexible methodology but a bit of a cumbersome one. One of the
main pushes in the current development of TRNSYS 17 is a much more
automated methodology for doing building self-shading. The Type56
developers are also working on a true view-factor methodology for
internal radiation exchange within a zone.

Kind regards,
 David

David,

I am not familiar with TRNBuild. Does it have a built-in CAD interface that
one can draw a building? Can one define building surfaces by coordinates?
Can one import a 2-D or 3-D CAD drawing? As I recall in Type56, one needs to
pre-calculate the wall and window areas by orientation for each zone and
input the area value into TRNSYS. I am not sure if this is still the case.

Thanks,
Chaoqin

Chaoqin -

There is not a CAD interface for Type56.  TRNBuild is a program that
allows you to define your zones and enter the wall and window areas and
define orientations and adjacencies of the walls, along with defining your
internal gains, infiltration flows, ventialtions flows, etc.

Tim

TRNBuild is a front-end program that allows for the input of the
parameters of Type56 in a more user-friendly manner.  Type56 is the TRNSYS
type which does the actual calculations.

Message-ID: <D445F37AE4F45F4BB38762EDA0D267B20529C97A@VS1.EXCHPROD.USA.NET>

Dear All,

 

I'm now working on a project using Districted Heating System provided by
a municipal system. The municipal system is working for a very large
areas providing steam for about hundred buildings. And my building is
one of them.

 

According to the latest update issued by USGBC
(https://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=4176), the modeling will
be implemented by two steps. My question is about Step-2 (Aggregate
Building/DES Scenario).  In step-2, the energy source of Proposed
Building is virtual on-site chiller representing upstream DC system. The
document also issues "The DES central plant itself shall always be
modeled as a total, entire unit." My understanding is that it requires
to model the central plant with the full capacity that is able to
provide heating for all of buildings in whole district. However, if
doing so, the energy consumption of the proposed building may be quite
quite high, since it includes the energy consumption of the whole
heating plant!! But my building is only one of the 100 buildings that

Hey all,

I created a pitched roof in eQUEST for a gable roof on a rectangular shell, but I need the ridge to run in the direction of the short dimension of the rectangle, not the long dimension.  Is there a way that eQUEST will allow this?  I am in the DD wizard.  Also, is there a way to "link" shells that are side-by-side (essentially eliminating the outside walls of the two shells and putting them right next to each other?  Thanks,

     -Dan

Dear All,

 

I'm now working on a project using Districted Heating System provided by a municipal system. The municipal system is working for a very large areas providing steam for about hundred buildings. And my building is one of them.

 

According to the latest update issued by USGBC (https://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=4176), the modeling will be implemented by two steps. My question is about Step-2 (Aggregate Building/DES Scenario).  In step-2, the energy source of Proposed Building is virtual on-site chiller representing upstream DC system. The document also issues "The DES central plant itself shall always be modeled as a total, entire unit." My understanding is that it requires to model the central plant with the full capacity that is able to provide heating for all of buildings in whole district. However, if doing so, the energy consumption of the proposed building may be quite quite high, since it includes the energy consumption of the whole heating plant!! But my building is only one of the 100 buildings that are heated by the central plant.  It is weird and  I don't think it is what USGBC asked for. Does anyone know what shall I do for the proposed building in Step-2? 

 

Thank you.

Dear all,

 

I have a question about using Energypro to build energy model for LEED
SS c1. The energy model baseline changes slightly every time I made some
changes to the proposed model. I usually need run different energy
scenarios to meet certain energy cost saving percentage to get LEED
credit. My question is: should I use a fixed baseline for all scenarios
or just used the automatic baseline by Energypro?

 

 

Thanks

Hi Karen,

Finally I recreated my model and the problem is gone. However, I still don't know what causes such a weired issue. Thanks a lot for all your kind help.

When eQuest runs, it creates a couple .csv files with run results. ?these files contain monthly total energy use and peak use in all categories, summed for the building. ?Perhaps eQuest cannot find these files? ?The files are usually placed in the project folder. ?I have never had this problem before, but this is where I would start.

Message-ID: <20080805202209.84D8448002@diego.dreamhost.com>

Table 6.8.1F, ASHRAE 90.1 lists the minimum boiler efficiencies for 
modelling the budget case.  Two types of efficiencies are listed Et - 
thermal efficiency and Ec - combustion efficiency.  How do these two 
efficiency rating types translate into DOE2.1e boiler efficiency.
For example a boiler listed in Table 6.8.1F with an Et = 75%, would 
that be HW-BOILER-HIR     = 1.333?
What about a boiler listed as 80% Ec?

I am somewhat confused about the two efficiency ratings.

May,
>From the context of the paragraph, I personally believe and kind of hope the intent of the section you quoted section is primarily that:
- the energy accounting should be based on the annual efficiency of the entire plant as it will be operated
But also that:
- the energy accounting does not need to include the energy consumption of the entire plant
- the energy modeling does not need to include discrete modeling of every component in the plant

Notice that while Appendix G dictates number, size, type, and efficiency of baseline equipment, this document offers defaults that are simple system level efficiency values.

While the document anticipates refinement and invites feedback to leedinfo at usgbc.org, my emails have received only administrative acknowledgments after 8 weeks.

So if you cannot confidently decide how to apply this document to your project, you probably need to do a CIR.  They are not free but neither is time spent responding to the reviewers, remodeling, or both.

Good luck,

Paul Riemer

Hi Xu, 
?
I think everyone is wrestling with the new rules trying to figure out how to apply them?especially with respect to step 2.? You can query USGBC directly (at no cost) at leedinfo at usgbc.org.? I've found that the front line customer service people are not that familiar with the new rules yet either; but, they can elevate your question to the appropriate parties.? It just may take a little longer than usual to get an answer.? If your question is too project specific, they may tell you to send in a CIR instead.
?
Do you know the cost of your chilled water/hot water?that the municipality is going to charge you?? If so, I don't see the new Step 2?modeling requirements as a whole lot different from the old modeling rules.? The NEW?rules require a virtual chiller plant/boiler plant?to be modeled that is reflective of the actual plant's efficiency.??Under the?OLD rules,?if you knew the cost of the chilled water/hot water,?that?cost was?supposedly, inherently, reflective of the plant's efficiency as long as it incorporated all production costs (i.e. chillers, cooling towers, pumps, boilers, as applicable per utility) and could be used directly in your proposed model.??I would say this approach?still holds true for the?NEW?Step 2 model.? You may just need to do a little investigation with the utility and provide some back up data or a letter to LEED as a supporting documentation stating that all the relevant production costs are reflected in the cost
 of chw/hw (assuming that's the case).?? If you wanted to dig a little deeper, you may be able to get (electrical and chw/hw?water production) metering data from your utility and confirm/determine an actual?cost from that.? The NEW rules mention monitoring?data as an allowable?means of determining the virtual central plant's efficiency.....it seems like?metered electrical input and production output?would fit this description.

Dear All,



I'm now working on a project using Districted Heating System provided by
a municipal system. The municipal system is working for a very large
areas providing steam for about hundred buildings. And my building is
one of them.



According to the latest update issued by USGBC
(https://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=4176), the modeling will
be implemented by two steps. My question is about Step-2 (Aggregate
Building/DES Scenario).? In step-2, the energy source of Proposed
Building is virtual on-site chiller representing upstream DC system. The
document also issues "The DES central plant itself shall always be
modeled as a total, entire unit." My understanding is that it requires
to model the central plant with the full capacity that is able to
provide heating for all of buildings in whole district. However, if
doing so, the energy consumption of the proposed building may be quite
quite high, since it includes the energy consumption of the whole
heating plant!! But my building is only one of the 100 buildings that
are heated by the central plant.? It is weird and? I don't think it is
what USGBC asked for. Does anyone know what shall I do for the proposed
building in Step-2? 



Thank you.

I am trying to figure out where I can find the maximum total cooling

My only problem is that these two approaches have very low unrealistic

Dear Bldg-Sim Community,
 
Keep in mind that "Price" and "Cost" always include non-energy items like
maintenance, overhead, profit, etc.  That means using those values does not
often give an apples-apples comparison with energy efficiency.  For that
reason, the new USGBC guideline seems to be clear that you may not mix the
two.

Hi Xu, 
 
I think everyone is wrestling with the new rules trying to figure out how to
apply them especially with respect to step 2.  You can query USGBC directly
(at no cost) at leedinfo at usgbc.org.  I've found that the front line customer
service people are not that familiar with the new rules yet either; but,
they can elevate your question to the appropriate parties.  It just may take
a little longer than usual to get an answer.  If your question is too
project specific, they may tell you to send in a CIR instead.
 
Do you know the cost of your chilled water/hot water that the municipality
is going to charge you?  If so, I don't see the new Step 2 modeling
requirements as a whole lot different from the old modeling rules.  The NEW
rules require a virtual chiller plant/boiler plant to be modeled that is
reflective of the actual plant's efficiency.  Under the OLD rules, if you
knew the cost of the chilled water/hot water, that cost was supposedly,
inherently, reflective of the plant's efficiency as long as it incorporated
all production costs (i.e. chillers, cooling towers, pumps, boilers, as
applicable per utility) and could be used directly in your proposed model.
I would say this approach still holds true for the NEW Step 2 model.  You
may just need to do a little investigation with the utility and provide some
back up data or a letter to LEED as a supporting documentation stating that
all the relevant production costs are reflected in the cost of chw/hw
(assuming that's the case).   If you wanted to dig a little deeper, you may
be able to get (electrical and chw/hw water production) metering data from
your utility and confirm/determine an actual cost from that.  The NEW rules
mention monitoring data as an allowable means of determining the virtual
central plant's efficiency.....it seems like metered electrical input and
production output would fit this description.

The Laboratory has spent quite a bit of time modeling the thermal plant
on the Texas A&M Campus with good success. Unfortunately, we ended up
using some rather complex, interacting loop models with chiller on/off,
staging algorithms, etc.

We have a number of papers and thesis on this at our web site

Yes, agreed, the new rules seem to imply that maintenance costs, overhead, profit etc?do not need to be included in the analysis (in contrast some old CIRs).??These costs?would typcially be included in?a commercial or municipal district system.? However, local campus central plants may or may not have?those costs?figured in.? Either way, it's worth inquiring about with the chw/hw provider.??If they?have?information regarding their maintenance costs etc it would be good to extract those from the cost.??It would certainly work in you?proposed building's favor and be more of an apples to apples comparison with the baseline building.?

Message-ID: <20080806192553.DCCO28684.omta02.suddenlink.net@LarryD>

Hello Zhai Chaoqin:
 
Here is a response from Sonia Punjabi from USGBC in Wash, DC:
 
"LEED Energy and Atmosphere Credit 1 references ASHRAE 90.1.  Section 11 of
90.1 lists criteria as requirements for an acceptable modeling tool.
 
"Because of the wide range of modeling tools being used in the market, USGBC
has not undertaken an initiative to quantify which tools are and are not
acceptable for use to document LEED EA c1.  Generally speaking, most program
architects incorporate the 90.1 Section 11 criteria into their programs.
That said, it is still vital that you verify that the model you are
selecting for use meets the criteria.
 
"Modeling tools that deviate from Section 11 of 90.1 are approved for use in
LEED on a case by case basis.  In certain circumstances modeling tools that
deviate from Section 11 offer a cost benefit that far outweighs any
potential inaccuracy.  It is advisable to submit a CIR that clearly details
the modeling tools deficiencies and why the modeling tool is an acceptable
compliance path for your building program prior to submitting LEED EA c1
documentation that is based on a non-Section 11 compliant modeling tool."
 
Hope this helps!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Mixed air temp discrepancy in eQuest
Message-ID: <25F2BDB6656B8F40A1289ED906D6B5CF038E0DF2@EXCHANGE1.cadd_group.ghtltd.com>

I've been getting some warnings in a model I'm currently working on, and
I haven't been able to find a way to fix them.
 
The warnings are as follows:
 
 
**WARNING***************************************************************
*******
             PREHEAT/HEATING-CAPACITY in SYSTEM M AHU-26 (VAV)

             is too low to provide the requested supply temperature for
             the calculated mixed air temperature using total ZONE loads
             (on LS-A/B) and SYSTEM design parameters, plus outside air
             conditions (on LS-C), and specified capacities & air flows.
             Requested temperature is  55.00 calculated is  10.37
             Check HEATING-CAPACITY, HEAT-SET-T, PRE-HEAT-T,
MAX-SUPPLY-T,
             DESIGN-HEAT-T, and ZONE loads for consistency.
 
 
AHU-26 is a PIU system (series boxes).  Zone outside airflow is set up
at 20 CFM / person, the # of people is accurate, and the system is set
up to size the minimum OA based on the sum of the zone OA.
 
I can't figure out what's going on....it almost seems like the system is
not returning any air, and is at 100% OA.  But my OA is set to a fixed
fraction, and inputing an arbitrary supply CFM doesn't change the mixed
air temp warning at all (still 10.37).
 
I know it's hard to diagnose a problem without being able to open the
file (I'm happy to send someone the .inp and .pd2 files), but has anyone
run into this problem before?
 
Thanks!

All;
As I understand it, under the new rules, you should never be comparing district CHW or steam to utility elec and gas. Correct me if I'm wrong.
 
Either: 
District Vs. district, (inc all costs as given by provider) with only changed bldg systems (BUT baseline DX/furnace systems become CHW/HW types), envelope, lighting 
Or:
District plant(s) modeled to get elec & gas Vs. un-modified PRM baselines (elec & gas).

Yes, agreed, the new rules seem to imply that maintenance costs, overhead, profit etc do not need to be included in the analysis (in contrast some old CIRs).  These costs would typcially be included in a commercial or municipal district system.  However, local campus central plants may or may not have those costs figured in.  Either way, it's worth inquiring about with the chw/hw provider.  If they have information regarding their maintenance costs etc it would be good to extract those from the cost.  It would certainly work in you proposed building's favor and be more of an apples to apples comparison with the baseline building.

Dear Bldg-Sim Community,
 
Keep in mind that "Price" and "Cost" always include non-energy items like maintenance, overhead, profit, etc.  That means using those values does not often give an apples-apples comparison with energy efficiency.  For that reason, the new USGBC guideline seems to be clear that you may not mix the two.

Hi Xu, 
 
I think everyone is wrestling with the new rules trying to figure out how to apply them especially with respect to step 2.  You can query USGBC directly (at no cost) at leedinfo at usgbc.org.  I've found that the front line customer service people are not that familiar with the new rules yet either; but, they can elevate your question to the appropriate parties.  It just may take a little longer than usual to get an answer.  If your question is too project specific, they may tell you to send in a CIR instead.
 
Do you know the cost of your chilled water/hot water that the municipality is going to charge you?  If so, I don't see the new Step 2 modeling requirements as a whole lot different from the old modeling rules.  The NEW rules require a virtual chiller plant/boiler plant to be modeled that is reflective of the actual plant's efficiency.  Under the OLD rules, if you knew the cost of the chilled water/hot water, that cost was supposedly, inherently, reflective of the plant's efficiency as long as it incorporated all production costs (i.e. chillers, cooling towers, pumps, boilers, as applicable per utility) and could be used directly in your proposed model.  I would say this approach still holds true for the NEW Step 2 model.  You may just need to do a little investigation with the utility and provide some back up data or a letter to LEED as a supporting documentation stating that all the relevant production costs are reflected in the cost of chw/hw (assuming that's the case).   If you wanted to dig a little deeper, you may be able to get (electrical and chw/hw water production) metering data from your utility and confirm/determine an actual cost from that.  The NEW rules mention monitoring data as an allowable means of determining the virtual central plant's efficiency.....it seems like metered electrical input and production output would fit this description.

Dear All,



I'm now working on a project using Districted Heating System provided by
a municipal system. The municipal system is working for a very large
areas providing steam for about hundred buildings. And my building is
one of them.



According to the latest update issued by USGBC
(https://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=4176), the modeling will
be implemented by two steps. My question is about Step-2 (Aggregate
Building/DES Scenario).  In step-2, the energy source of Proposed
Building is virtual on-site chiller representing upstream DC system. The
document also issues "The DES central plant itself shall always be
modeled as a total, entire unit." My understanding is that it requires
to model the central plant with the full capacity that is able to
provide heating for all of buildings in whole district. However, if
doing so, the energy consumption of the proposed building may be quite
quite high, since it includes the energy consumption of the whole
heating plant!! But my building is only one of the 100 buildings that
are heated by the central plant.  It is weird and  I don't think it is
what USGBC asked for. Does anyone know what shall I do for the proposed
building in Step-2? 



Thank you.

**Solicitation for IBPSA News items will be coming soon, so get ready!  But
first, let me tell you about IBPSA's new public outreach structure! **
 
Following the BS2007 conference in Beijing, President Jan Hensen, along with
the IBPSA Board's concurrence, decided to do some restructuring of IBPSA's
publicity outreach activities.  One of the new initiatives is IBPSA's
official journal, Journal of Building Performance Simulation (JBPS), edited
by Jan Hensen and Ian Beausoleil-Morrison.  [See
http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/19401493.asp.]  First published in
March 2008, the Journal has already become a widely respected, scholarly,
journal of outstanding peer-reviewed building performance simulation works
across the globe.  We are also building an alliance with AIVC (the Air
Infiltration and Ventilation Centre - http://www.aivc.org
<http://www.aivc.org/> , which is the official information Centre of the IEA
(International Energy Agency) for ventilation and air infiltration in
buildings.  They publish a wealth of information in a quarterly newsletter,
AIR (Air Information Review), which will occasionally carry IBPSA
announcements of various conferences and other events.  You will find their
newsletters extremely informative, and you can find a full collection of the
news archives, starting from 1989 and up through the present at:
http://www.aivc.org/frameset/frameset.html?../Air/air.html~mainFrame.  
 
IBPSA's new structure now has a Public Relations committee, which I am
pleased to chair.  Members of this committee include Veronica Soebarto
(Adelaide) as the Newsletter Editor-in-Chief, Etienne Wurtz (IBPSA-France),
and Marion Bartholomew (U.K.) as Newsletter Production Editor.  Marion has
served this function remarkably well over the past 12 or more years, and we
are pleased to continue to have her services.
 
So, get ready to submit your simulation news items.  Watch for a request
from Veronica Soebarto - it should be coming soon.  Take a look at
http://www.ibpsa.org/m_newsletter.asp to see the past Newsletters from 1996
to the present.
 
Best regards,

Message-ID: <1218081026.489a7102c3729@webmail.vt.edu>


Hi-

We modeled a building with GSHP in a hot climate (zone 1), so it is almost used
for cooling only. The air-side is PVAVS. water-cooled condenser with GSWL. The
cooling COP input is ~5. However, the system performs almost the same as
ordinary air-cooled chillers.

We think the reason may be the high earth temperature (~85 F is used due to the
local
climate).

GSHP does not appear to be a solution for hot climate? Any one has some resource
of real data for this?

Thanks,
Ying

Hi May,

I interpret the update differently. It does not state that the capacity must
be the same, only that the efficiencies must be the same. I believe it is
expected that you create a virtual onsite plant sized to replace the loads
normally covered by the DES. The virtual plant must have the same
efficiencies as the actual plant, but not the same capacity.  In addition
you must implement a calculation or approximation to account for losses in
the distribution system. I believe that the statement "the DES central plant
itself shall always be modeled as a total, entire unit" is to prevent the
model from combining the virtual plant (to cover DES loads) with any
supplementary onsite plants that may exist. I don't think it is intended
that you model the DES at its actual capacity.

Anyone else have a different opinion?

It seems that the intention here is that if a credit is taken for an exemplary LEED building for energy efficiency, it will have to overcome district energy system (DES) inefficiencies if they are present.  But at the same time, you are able to get the minimum two EAC1 credits, to some degree regardless of how bad the DES performs - so not excluding most projects, but limiting the options for those projects with inefficient infrastructures.  This recognizes some of the constraints that a campus project might encounter.

Likewise an efficient DES that may have efficient equipment, cogeneration, heat recovery or other efficiencies will benefit the LEED project and the team is rewarded for having built onto this type of system.


Step 1:  Building stand-alone scenario - for EAP2 compliance as well as documenting up to two EAC1 credits.  In both cases will be purchased from district energy systems for heating and cooling as appropriate.  This I think was the discrepancy between Fred and Julia's posts - the USGBC document states on page 8 that the actual prices are to be used, so it would include the overhead and profit components for a commercial DES.  For campus situations without a "price" you must calculate the equivalent value and it isn't specified if this includes the overhead components.

If your building used DES for only one source, then the other source would be modeled as proposed with the baseline equipment per App G.

So as Fred mentioned, it will be DES vs DES, chiller vs chiller, or boiler vs boiler, etc.

If only pursuing EAP2 and two or fewer EAC1 credits (and achieving them?), stop here.


Step 2:  Aggregate building - for pursuit of additional EAC1 credits - here the DES will be modeled for electricity and fuel usage, and compared to a building with baseline heating and cooling equipment per App G.

The key point of the text is "virtual on-site equipment representing upstream" systems.  So not exactly that system, but representing the LEED project's share of that system.

Putting some numbers to a cooling plant for example purposes, the intention is not for you to model a 500 ton load building being served by a plant with four 5,000 ton chillers.  Neither is the intention that you should model the other buildings making up the 19,500 ton difference.

The simulation programs are generally able to use efficiency calculations based on the total plant, but imposed on a theoretical smaller "virtual" plant serving the load of the new project.  This is a reasonable approximation to the share of the plant energy for the new project assuming the cooling/heating loads are following the profile of the DES in general.  The virtual 500 ton chiller will have capacity specified to match the LEED project's demand, but with the efficiency curves and EIR of the existing 5,000 ton chillers.

Obviously the capacity of everything in the plant would have to be adjusted, not just the chillers and boilers - include pumps, cooling towers, etc.

There is a statement about Step 2 only providing up to four additional EAC1 credits over Step 1, up to a maximum total of ten credits (like normal).  But my interpretation of the document is that even if you documented six EAC1 credits in step 1, you can only claim two of them unless you unlocked that potential by proceeding to Step 2.  Is this everyone else's interpretation also?

Hope this helps!

David

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] District Thermal System

It seems that the intention here is that if a credit is taken for an
exemplary LEED building for energy efficiency, it will have to overcome
district energy system (DES) inefficiencies if they are present.  But at
the same time, you are able to get the minimum two EAC1 credits, to some
degree regardless of how bad the DES performs - so not excluding most
projects, but limiting the options for those projects with inefficient
infrastructures.  This recognizes some of the constraints that a campus
project might encounter.

Likewise an efficient DES that may have efficient equipment,
cogeneration, heat recovery or other efficiencies will benefit the LEED
project and the team is rewarded for having built onto this type of
system.


Step 1:  Building stand-alone scenario - for EAP2 compliance as well as
documenting up to two EAC1 credits.  In both cases will be purchased
from district energy systems for heating and cooling as appropriate.
This I think was the discrepancy between Fred and Julia's posts - the
USGBC document states on page 8 that the actual prices are to be used,
so it would include the overhead and profit components for a commercial
DES.  For campus situations without a "price" you must calculate the
equivalent value and it isn't specified if this includes the overhead
components.

If your building used DES for only one source, then the other source
would be modeled as proposed with the baseline equipment per App G.

So as Fred mentioned, it will be DES vs DES, chiller vs chiller, or
boiler vs boiler, etc.

If only pursuing EAP2 and two or fewer EAC1 credits (and achieving
them?), stop here.


Step 2:  Aggregate building - for pursuit of additional EAC1 credits -
here the DES will be modeled for electricity and fuel usage, and
compared to a building with baseline heating and cooling equipment per
App G.

The key point of the text is "virtual on-site equipment representing
upstream" systems.  So not exactly that system, but representing the
LEED project's share of that system.

Putting some numbers to a cooling plant for example purposes, the
intention is not for you to model a 500 ton load building being served
by a plant with four 5,000 ton chillers.  Neither is the intention that
you should model the other buildings making up the 19,500 ton
difference.

The simulation programs are generally able to use efficiency
calculations based on the total plant, but imposed on a theoretical
smaller "virtual" plant serving the load of the new project.  This is a
reasonable approximation to the share of the plant energy for the new
project assuming the cooling/heating loads are following the profile of
the DES in general.  The virtual 500 ton chiller will have capacity
specified to match the LEED project's demand, but with the efficiency
curves and EIR of the existing 5,000 ton chillers.

Obviously the capacity of everything in the plant would have to be
adjusted, not just the chillers and boilers - include pumps, cooling
towers, etc.

There is a statement about Step 2 only providing up to four additional
EAC1 credits over Step 1, up to a maximum total of ten credits (like
normal).  But my interpretation of the document is that even if you
documented six EAC1 credits in step 1, you can only claim two of them
unless you unlocked that potential by proceeding to Step 2.  Is this
everyone else's interpretation also?

Hope this helps!

David

According to the source we got,  the ground temperature is 85F, although the
ground temper in a lots of other locations in the world are about 55F.

Do you have some other source for the ground temperature?

Thanks,

The ground temperature is not a constant if it is subjected to heat fluxes from a local underground source such as a geoexchanger.  think of the ground as a large thermal storage medium, with fluxes at its extreme bottom and top boundaries.  At the bottom is the hot core of the earth.  At the top is the fluctating air temperature and radiant flux at the surface.  In general, the average temperature below ground is going to be approximately the average sol-air temperature of the surface.  The deeper you go, the smaller is the variation over time, and the more delayed is that variation from what is going on at the surface.  At a few meters below the surface, temperature variation is very small.  Deeper still, the temperature will begin to rise. With a geoexchanger, however, local heat flux from gthe device can cause significant variations in temperature. If seasonal flux is not balanced, over time, the ground local to the geoexchanger will conform to a new equilibrium temperature, sufficiently variant from the "average" subterranean temperature to disperse that local heat flux into the surrounding earth.  Given that the thermal conducitivity of "earth" is not enormous, that temperature differential could be quite large.

Ground source heatpumps were initially very popular in Phoneix. Within a year or two, they "heat soaked' the ground surrounding their wells, and the heat pumps ceased operating.  Most of them ahve been abandoned, or supplemented by evaporative heat rejection devices.

Think of geoexchangers as annual thermal storage devices, not as unlimited heat sources or sinks.

Ying -
If your building is in the U.S., you can find the average ground
temperature in your area with the map in ASHRAE HVAC Applications,
Chapter 32.  For moderate climates like most of the continental U.S. the
average ground temperature is just a few degrees above average annual
air temperature.  In Zone 1, you could have an average ground
temperature near 80.  

If you do a GSHP system, you'll likely want a hybrid system that uses a
cooling tower or fluid cooler to balance your system, allowing the
ground loop to be smaller.  This may make it a reasonable system choice.

Message-ID: <5166c4930808081245l7704cb77ocec92f8ffdbbf62e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I would like to model a 26storey   existing building with EQuest, however
the plans  are in pdf format, and I am not sure if I need to redraw them in
autocad.  the first two floors has different shape and part of the 2nd
floor is connected to 1st floor as a 2 storey gallery and there are 2
parking under ground(under first floor). I am wondering if I should model
the whole building in the schematic design without the first 2 floors and
parkings and then add them to the building?
Building is rectangular in shape and the 24 story is expanded over the first
2 floor.

How can I model the 2 connected story? and how can I put these 2 stories
under the whole building.

Thanks alot,
Mona A.

My suggestion (not knowing the level of your modeling experience) is to
model the entire 26 floors in the Schematic design (all same size). You
will only see Floors 1, 2 and 26, as Floor 2 will be represented by a
multiplier.
 
Then switch to detailed Design Wizard (DD Wizard) and begin adding each
floor above the 2nd as a "clone" of the previous floor. Once you get to
floor 25 and look at the building 3-D, you will now see all 26 floors.
 
NOW, staying in the DD Wizard, go back to floors 1 and 2, and, using the
Footprint definition on Wizard Screen 2, go to "Custom". This will allow
you to draw on a lattice where you can STRETCH the 1st floor, save it,
and go to Floor 2 to do the same thing.
 
You need to "play" with this a bit.

I just wanted to throw in a comment from a "sort of" hot climate. Is this discussion referring to deep vertical wells or horizontal field lines? The field line types are highly dependent on correct depth and incorrect depth is a reason for many system performance problems. The well types are not foolproof by any means but tend to produce dependable results, even in Florida (where there are numerous installations).

Hey all,

I need to create a DOA HVAC system that has water cooled compressors for cooling and furnace for heating.  The system also has 50% energy recovery via an enthalpy wheel.  I don't know how to designate the system as 100% outside air, and I also don't see any options for energy recovery.  Does anyone know how to do these two things?  I am in the DD wizard.  Thanks,

Does anyone have insight on a relatively easy way to model free-cooling
coils on air-cooled chillers?  I thought adding a drycooler might help
simulate this, but I don't even think you can attach a heat-rejection
device directly to a chilled water loop.  Is this one of those things
that you have to "estimate" by approximating the total # of available
free-cooling hours and subtracting compressor energy?
 
Thanks

Message-ID: <C3DBC55BC8F3EC4FA597BDDCAE4BBFE205EB75F4@ex-be02.burohappold.com>

 

Hi All,

 

I have modelled two chillers with fixed capacities meant to share the
cooling load. The "PS-C Equipment Load and Energy use" report shows load
assigned to only one of the chillers while the "PV-A Plant Design
Parameters" report shows chilled water flow through the chilled water
loop for both the chillers. The 'help' of the detailed report does not
explain this very well.

Could someone please help me out?

 

Thanks,

Minu

For those interested, I think I figured out how to do this (with some
direction from Linda).  I set up a "dummy" water-cooled chiller with an
associated drycooler for heat rejection.  The chiller EIR was set to 0,
the condenser water circulating pump horsepower was set to 0, and the
EIR of the drycooler was set to the power that I think the air-cooled
chiller condenser fans will use during free-cooling operation.
 
I then set up two Equipment Control components called "Greater than 38"
and "Less than 38".  "Less than 38" has my dummy chiller set up to
handle the load, and "Greater than 38" has my normal air-cooled chillers
set to handle the load.  I then set up a Load Management component.
Management Seq 1 references the "Less than 38" Eqpm Ctrl with the Max
OSA Temp set to 38 degrees.  Management Seq 2 references the "Greater
than 38" Eqpm Ctrl with the Max OSA Temp set to 110 degrees.  (You could
set the switchover point to whatever you prefer).
 
I didn't spend that much time fiddling with this, but it looks like it
may have worked.  My dummy chiller operates 6 hrs in October, 19 in
November, 106 in December, 149 in January, 133 in February, 47 in March
and 4 in April (Washington, DC area).  That looks about right.
 
For reference, the utility bills dropped from $247,931 to $246,744 (for
a 140,000 sq ft office building in DC).  This worked out to a 6%
reduction in total space cooling energy for the year, but only about a
0.5% decrease in total utility bills.
 
And this doesn't take into account the added pressure drop across the
air-cooled chiller condenser fans for the rest of the year.  This
relatively minor increase in savings is probably why free-cooling coils
in air-cooled chillers in this climate are not particularly favorable.
And also why the took the economizer requirement out of 90.1-2004 and
the 2006 IECC (for our climate zone).
 
I welcome any comments if I did something incorrectly....

Does anyone have insight on a relatively easy way to model free-cooling
coils on air-cooled chillers?  I thought adding a drycooler might help
simulate this, but I don't even think you can attach a heat-rejection
device directly to a chilled water loop.  Is this one of those things
that you have to "estimate" by approximating the total # of available
free-cooling hours and subtracting compressor energy?

Hi all-
 
A quick, but kind of hazy question for me at least, regarding LEED projects.  Let's just say, that a building is composed of multiple wall types, spanning a range of the ASHRAE 90.1 definitions...some portions of the building is steel framed, another portion is mass wall, and yet another portion is wood framed, for example.

I believe you need only put in the one ASHRAE 90.1 minimum wall U-value.
Exactly what Table 5.5 asks for.

Chien,

Have a look at Table G3.1 in ASHRAE 90.1-2004. As far as I can tell, above-grade walls in the baseline case are to be modeled as steel-framed using the assembly maximum U-factor from Tables 5.5.

In Table G3.1 (#5 Building Envelope) of 90.1-2004, it says that:

?Opaque assemblies...shall conform with the following common, lightweight
assembly types and shall match the appropriate assembly maximum U-factors in
Tables 5.5-1 through 5.5-8:
* Roofs ? Insulation entirely above deck
* Above grade walls ? steel framed
* Floors ? Steel joist?

So every baseline wall should have the assembly max U-factor for a
steel-framed wall. This also allows credit to be taken for having mass walls
in your proposed design.

All,
 
There is likely some confusion due to two statements in the LEED Reference Guide:

*	On Page 177, under "b. Opague Assemblies" the reference guide states "The Performance Rating Method specifies the type of assembly required for the Baseline Building wall, roof, and floor construction. The ECB method varies the construction assembly type modeled in the Building Budget Design based on the actual construction assembly type modeled in the Proposed Design."
*	On Page 180, under "Building Envelope" the reference guide states "The Performance Rating Method requires that the Proposed Design be modeled as designed with a few minor exceptions. For the Baseline Design of new buildings, the above-grade walls, roof, and floor assemblies must be modeled using light-weight assembly types (i.e., steel-framed walls, roof with insulation entirely above deck, and steel-joist floors), with ASHRAE Std. 90.1 prescriptive maximum U-factors for the building's climate. Even if the Proposed Design incorporates mass wall construction, the Baseline Design must be modeled using a steel-framed assembly:"

Obviously, the reference to the ECB Method on page 177 causes some confusion to the reader. However, I read that all building baseline constructions should use a light-weight, steel-framed construction per the statements on page 180.

Message-ID: <7E4EF7766063EC4091542B5B3E671EC40114FA80@MAIL.iesve.com>

Hi all-
 
Thanks for answering that good, albeit simple, question yesterday.  I've got another one today, that is more obscure, and one that I've run into on a number of occasions in the last few weeks, as more and more projects are asking for advice on natural ventilation feasibility.
 
Conditioned spaces, semi-heated spaces, and unconditioned spaces seem pretty straightforward to determine.  In my experience, conditioned spaces must simply meet the criteria set forth for cooling load and heating load (which is a Btu/hr.ft2 threshold, which is dependent upon the climate zone for heating load, at least).  If a space has no heating or cooling system at all, or virtually no load, then the space is unconditioned.  Semi heated kind of falls between the two.
 
But indirectly conditioned spaces, where do they really apply?  This is made more complicated by the ASHRAE 90.1 stipulation that naturally ventilated spaces must be modeled with a cooling system (I guess this is sort of like a hybrid system) to meet the load should your space be poorly designed.  We have some people scratching their heads now that nat vent is becoming more inviting.
 
Have I missed anything here?
 
Sincerely,
Chien Si

Hi,

I am modeling 2 buildings each 26 storey. part of the first 2 floors are
connected as a gallery.1) I do not know how to model 2 first floors such
that part of the plan as a 2 storey high and the rest with 2 different

2)My other question is that when we model with multiplier how we can clone
the plan inorder to see the whole building in the 3d view

3) In addition I am wondering how to define the electricity and gas rate
other than California.

Many thanks,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] GSHP in hot climate
Message-ID: <4356BBD2A1FD7547B10BB742FFAD4B2006CD233C@lsbsrvr04.lsb-okc.com>

A couple of clarifications and my opinions regarding GSHP in hot climate.
 
1. "200 well feet per ton"
 
The "200 well feet per ton" is not a universal rule for sizing ground heat exchanger (GHX). According to a veteran of GSHP industry, "200 well feet per ton" was originally developed based on calculation/experience for single family house at Stillwater, Oklahoma, which has near-balanced heat rejection and extraction loads and thus there is no concern of heat built up in long term (in the scale of multi years). In addition, the undisturbed ground temperature is around 63F. For other buildings in different locations, GHX has to be sized based on both peak and cumulative heating and cooling loads, geology information, heat pump performance, layout of borehole field, and etc. In addition, long-tern heat built-up needs to be accounted for if unbalanced ground heat rejection and extraction exists. I'm not sure whether "200 well feet per ton" was used for sizing GHX of the GSHP systems in Phoenix mentioned in Dan's earlier e-mail. If it was the case, I will not be surprised about the failed systems. A simple eQUEST simulation can approve this.
 
2. Ground (loop) temperature
 
I agree with Dan's analysis of heat transfer in the ground and the resulting variation of fluid temperature in the GHX. Only one addition: due to the fluctuation of the building loads, the ground may be able to "have some rest" to recover from the increased/decreased temperature when the loads is reduced from its peak (i.e. the surrounding ground temperature of a GHX will go down in the summer night, or during summer break if the building is a school). These factors should also be accounted for when assessing the feasibility of GSHP and/or sizing the GHX. 
 
3. Energy efficiency of GSHP in hot climate
 
While climate zone 1 may be the extreme for GSHP systems, many GSHP systems have been working well and energy efficiently in regions with hot summer and cold winter, such as Oklahoma City and Dallas. For a properly designed GSHP system, the leaving fluid temperature will rarely exceed 90F, but the daytime ambient air temperature could be above 90F for couple of months in summer. It makes the GSHP system more energy efficient than air-cooled chiller when cooling loads are peaked. To further improving energy efficiency of GSHP system in cooling mode, following practices are usually taken:
    - hybrid GHX with supplemental heat rejection
    - decentralize the borehole field (to reduce the effect of thermal coupling among boreholes) and the pumping system (in lieu of variable speed pumping)
    - utilize energy recovery ventilation

This is a heat balance problem.  While the sol-air temperature cycle (diurnal or seasonal) may have little impact some distance below the surface, the annual average surface temperature will have a big impact.  The average temperature underground reflects the balance of heat transfer between the surface and the very hot depths.  So, the temperature 30 ft. below grade in Alaska is very much colder than the temperature 30 ft. below the surface in the Arabian desert.  Lateral heat transfer (equi-depth) has little effect unless there is a local heat source or sink, like a geoexchanger.  There is no magic underground temperature.  It is a product of the local heat balance through a somewhat conductive continuous medium (the ground), between the surface and the core of the earth.  Because the core is so far down, it has little effect until you get very deep, like miles. Recommended minimum horizontal spacing between vertical wells is on the order of  30 ft.  There is a significant loss of performance when that distance is reduced to 20 ft.  

In the  case of a hot climate, think about where the heat goes.  It is being delivered at a continuous, but varying rate over the course of the year.  There is little or no extraction of heat from the ground by the heat pump.  The usual assumption is that closed loop wells need about 200 well feet per ton.  In Phoenix, for a residence, you might expect  2000 full load hours for the year.  So, a vastly simplified calculation would yield that each foot of well has to lose approximately 17 Btu/hr on average over the year.  Some of that heat will be conducted away and some will (temporarily, until equilibrium is reached) serve to raise the temperature of the local earth.  The actual thermal mass of the earth is large compared with the heat conduction coefficient, so that it takes a few years to heat up the ground.  Do the calculation and figure out what the average temperature at the well has to be to drive that much heat flow, once the system is in equilibrium, using the concentric pipe insulation formula to calculate the logarithmic mean heat trtansfer surface area.  I think you will be surprised at how high it is.  

David Schaetzle, a former professor at ASU, has some on-hands experience with this phenomenon, and first brought it to my attention at the Cooling Frontiers Workshop organized by the late Jeff Cook in 2001.

The sol-air temperature stops affecting the ground temperature at a distance of 5 meters (roughly). If you are installing a vertical well, that temperature fluctuation should not have a significant effect on the performance of the well. I also believe that the new equilibrium temperature that you are referring too is localized to within a meter (roughly) of the well. Can't this ground temperature stabilization can be off-set by increasing the spacing of the vertical wells?

The ground temperature is not a constant if it is subjected to heat fluxes from a local underground source such as a geoexchanger.  think of the ground as a large thermal storage medium, with fluxes at its extreme bottom and top boundaries.  At the bottom is the hot core of the earth.  At the top is the fluctating air temperature and radiant flux at the surface.  In general, the average temperature below ground is going to be approximately the average sol-air temperature of the surface.  The deeper you go, the smaller is the variation over time, and the more delayed is that variation from what is going on at the surface.  At a few meters below the surface, temperature variation is very small.  Deeper still, the temperature will begin to rise. With a geoexchanger, however, local heat flux from gthe device can cause significant variations in temperature. If seasonal flux is not balanced, over time, the ground local to the geoexchanger will conform to a new equilibrium temperature, sufficiently variant from the "average" subterranean temperature to disperse that local heat flux into the surrounding earth.  Given that the thermal conducitivity of "earth" is not enormous, that temperature differential could be quite large.

Ground source heatpumps were initially very popular in Phoneix. Within a year or two, they "heat soaked' the ground surrounding their wells, and the heat pumps ceased operating.  Most of them ahve been abandoned, or supplemented by evaporative heat rejection devices.

Think of geoexchangers as annual thermal storage devices, not as unlimited heat sources or sinks.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] IES-VE for LEED
Message-ID: <000401c8fcdf$c9d3b2e0$a32012b2@hotinkit>

Dear all,

I have been trying the IES-VE for LEED assessment for some time. Regarding
to setting up the baseline model according to Ashrae 90.1 2004, I have
following questions need to be clarified.

For a 31 levels commercial building, a VAV system with centrifugal Chiller
(300tons) at minimum efficiency of COP 6.1 and IPLV 6.4 is required as the
baseline HVAC model as stated in table 6.8.1C of section 6.8 of Ashrae
Standard 90.1 2004 and Table G3.1.1 of Appendix G. (Please correct me if it
is wrong).


Q.1 	Could anyone please  tell me the way to setup a such system in the IES
Model? Should I use Apache system or Apache HVAC?
Q.2  	For using Apache system, could anyone please tell me how to input the
required values, especially to
		1) Generator nominal EER,
		2) Generator seasonal EER, and
		3) SSEER
		4) Heat rejection fraction

Q.3 	In this connection, I noted that chapter5 of the VE Compliance User
manual states this

"On the cooling side an analogous relationship exists between SSEER and the
following parameters:
EER - the cooling system generator energy efficiency ratio or COP "

As the general conversion of EER to COP is 3.412, then a system with EER of
6.1 would be equal to COP of 20.8, which is out of the editable range in the
IES VE. Could anyone please  help to clarify the difference between EER and
COP here.


Thank a lot for any kindly information, and your reply is highly
appreciated.

Dear all, 

While investigating on sustainability studies we came across a study
performed using IES (integrated environmental solutions) software. 

This software turned out to be compatible with Revit software which we
are currently using for modeling buildings. 

However the software we are currently using for building energy
simulations is DesignBuilder, could anyone please list the advantage of
DesignBuilder over IES? Do you think that we should switch to IES?

When modeling an existing building, is required to calculate the
proposed building window to wall ratio and equally redistribute the
glass area to the baseline building and prepare models for the four
rotation exposures?  My take is that for a proposed existing building,
there is not an opportunity to position the building to the most
advantageous exposure and you could end up being penalized if the
baseline energy use is averaged for all rotations but I have not been
able to find any reference in LEED or ASHRAE to support this. I'm not
sure what to think about equal redistribution of the glass areas.

Michael, 

I don't have any experience with this yet, but recognizing that it will
be necessary for myself in the near future as it is for some, like
yourself,  already I went ahead and asked our local Daikin Rep about
getting VRF routines incorporated into eQuest.  The following is a
response given today by the Daikin engineering department:

|...EnergyPro is basically done.  The VRVIII units have been added and
DOE |testing has been performed to verify the results.  Martyn Dodd will
be at |Sawgrass to bring us all up to speed.
|
|eQuest as well EnergyPlus are next to tackle and we have already made
|contact and started working with the software developers.  The time
frame |is middle to end of 2009 for both software packages.  eQuest is
more of a |wildcard because there are some major software changes
happening on that |platform because of something called the "Design
Sizing" project which is |very delayed and could end up hurting our
timeline.  I have found in past |that these timelines typically slip so
please be wary about making any |concrete promises but you have my
assurance that it is being worked on and |we will eventually (i.e.
anywhere from 12 months to 30 months) have this |done.
|
|If this is a project with immediate LEED implications, I would explore
|EnergyPro.  There is a Daikin specific site on EnergyPro's domain now.

|
|Sincerely,
|Sherwin Khayatian

So, at least from the Daikin side it seems that the only sure way to go
at this time is with EnergyPro.  I don't know of a responsive local
Mitsubishi Rep in my area, but maybe someone out there can ask similar
question to Mitsubishi regarding their involvement with supporting an
eQuest-compatible VRF routine.

Thanks,

Dan Russell, EIT

Michael,

 

As the other poster mentioned, Energypro is the software of choice for
modeling VRF systems including Mitsubishi City Multi.  While I suspect
that Mitsubishi is pursuing support in other programs such as eQuest I
don't think we'll see anything in the near future.  Due to the complex
nature of these systems I haven't found a reliable way of modeling them
in other software packages, and know that Mitsubishi encourages the use
of Energypro.

Mark, 
Under ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G, Table G3.1, Section 5, "Baseline Building
Performance" column, requirement (f) (take a breath...) it states that
"For existing building envelopes, the baseline building design shall
reflect existing conditions prior to any revisions that are part of the
scope of work being evaluated". So the rotation doesn't apply to you.
Also, I interpret that to mean the windows don't need to be
redistributed either. Hope that helps!

A variable that has a major affect on geoexchange well field performance
is the amount of subsurface water movement through the well field;
unfortunately it's not easy (or possible) to determine the actual affect
the subsurface water will have on the field.  Our typical fields consist
of wells that are somewhere between 150' to 400' deep with capacity of
175ft/ton for a grouted well.  We monitor well field supply and return
water temperatures for many sites and with out a doubt, fields with
subsurface water operate much, much butter than dry sites.  If your site
is in a hot/wet climent (i.e. Flordia), I would think a geoexchange is a
valid system, (note, I have not designed a geothermal system in FL).  On
the other hand if you're in a hot dry climate, you may want to rethink
your system.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] GSHP in hot climate

 

This is a heat balance problem.  While the sol-air temperature cycle
(diurnal or seasonal) may have little impact some distance below the
surface, the annual average surface temperature will have a big impact.
The average temperature underground reflects the balance of heat
transfer between the surface and the very hot depths.  So, the
temperature 30 ft. below grade in Alaska is very much colder than the
temperature 30 ft. below the surface in the Arabian desert.  Lateral
heat transfer (equi-depth) has little effect unless there is a local
heat source or sink, like a geoexchanger.  There is no magic underground
temperature.  It is a product of the local heat balance through a
somewhat conductive continuous medium (the ground), between the surface
and the core of the earth.  Because the core is so far down, it has
little effect until you get very deep, like miles. Recommended minimum
horizontal spacing between vertical wells is on the order of  30 ft.
There is a significant loss of performance when that distance is reduced
to 20 ft.  

In the  case of a hot climate, think about where the heat goes.  It is
being delivered at a continuous, but varying rate over the course of the
year.  There is little or no extraction of heat from the ground by the
heat pump.  The usual assumption is that closed loop wells need about
200 well feet per ton.  In Phoenix, for a residence, you might expect
2000 full load hours for the year.  So, a vastly simplified calculation
would yield that each foot of well has to lose approximately 17 Btu/hr
on average over the year.  Some of that heat will be conducted away and
some will (temporarily, until equilibrium is reached) serve to raise the
temperature of the local earth.  The actual thermal mass of the earth is
large compared with the heat conduction coefficient, so that it takes a
few years to heat up the ground.  Do the calculation and figure out what
the average temperature at the well has to be to drive that much heat
flow, once the system is in equilibrium, using the concentric pipe
insulation formula to calculate the logarithmic mean heat trtansfer
surface area.  I think you will be surprised at how high it is.  

David Schaetzle, a former professor at ASU, has some on-hands experience
with this phenomenon, and first brought it to my attention at the
Cooling Frontiers Workshop organized by the late Jeff Cook in 2001.

	The sol-air temperature stops affecting the ground temperature
at a distance of 5 meters (roughly). If you are installing a vertical
well, that temperature fluctuation should not have a significant effect
on the performance of the well. I also believe that the new equilibrium
temperature that you are referring too is localized to within a meter
(roughly) of the well. Can't this ground temperature stabilization can
be off-set by increasing the spacing of the vertical wells?

Re: [Bldg-sim] GSHP in hot climate

 

 

 

	
	
	
	The ground temperature is not a constant if it is subjected to
heat fluxes from a local underground source such as a geoexchanger.
think of the ground as a large thermal storage medium, with fluxes at
its extreme bottom and top boundaries.  At the bottom is the hot core of
the earth.  At the top is the fluctating air temperature and radiant
flux at the surface.  In general, the average temperature below ground
is going to be approximately the average sol-air temperature of the
surface.  The deeper you go, the smaller is the variation over time, and
the more delayed is that variation from what is going on at the surface.
At a few meters below the surface, temperature variation is very small.
Deeper still, the temperature will begin to rise. With a geoexchanger,
however, local heat flux from gthe device can cause significant
variations in temperature. If seasonal flux is not balanced, over time,
the ground local to the geoexchanger will conform to a new equilibrium
temperature, sufficiently variant from the "average" subterranean
temperature to disperse that local heat flux into the surrounding earth.
Given that the thermal conducitivity of "earth" is not enormous, that
temperature differential could be quite large.
	
	Ground source heatpumps were initially very popular in Phoneix.
Within a year or two, they "heat soaked' the ground surrounding their
wells, and the heat pumps ceased operating.  Most of them ahve been
abandoned, or supplemented by evaporative heat rejection devices.
	
	Think of geoexchangers as annual thermal storage devices, not as
unlimited heat sources or sinks.

All,

Steve Gates is working with Daiken to develop the algorithms and data 
necessary to be able to model VRFs in eQUEST. He is also developing a 
new eQUEST platform simultaneously and more slowly called the Design Day 
platform which will solve many of the perceived "problems" with eQUEST 
subroutines. I do not know when the DD platform will be available but I 
don't think it will slow him up with respect to developing the VRF 
algorithms. They will be added to the existing eQUEST platform. These 
algorithms will be available some time early to mid next year.

The EnergyPro algorithms are based on MSA data and were developed by 
Tianzen Hong for Martin Dodd. I do not know if there is enough of a 
difference between MSA VRFs and Daiken VRFs operation/data that would 
make the EnergyPro tool inappropriate for use in analyzing the Daiken 
VRFs. Someone else could answer this question. Maybe the Daiken rep 
quoted here knows enough about it and using EnergyPro is quite appropriate.

Carol Gardner

In Energypro it is quite easy to model either the Daiken or Mitsubishi
systems as there are separate library data files available for download
for each system.  The Mits system does operate somewhat differently from
Daiken so I'm not sure I would want to model one based on the data files
of the other.  As Carol stated, the data files are based on information
provided by their respective manufacturers so the Energypro output
should be trustworthy in either case.

Message-ID: <5F14F416E053224F86F40C5E8440DE8C81A8F0@gateway.sbwconsulting.local>

All,

 

I have a need to simulate the performance of a hypothetical fluid cooler
applied to a condenser of a distillation process. I am trying to
determine the energy consumption that is being avoided by the
installation of heat exchangers that are effectively serving the
condensing function. I have data to determine actual hourly values of
heat rejection (BTU/hr), fluid (not water) temperatures and flow rates
and should be able to obtain hourly weather data for the period
corresponding to the data. I can get design values for the fluid cooler
from a vendor. I only need to determine the energy consumed by the fluid
cooler - no other building energy is of interest. I am thinking I may be
able to do this in eQuest, assigning a process load to the fluid cooler
after developing a schedule from the data I have and putting a meter on
the fluid cooler. My concerns are that the fluid is not water (I have
been unsuccessful in the past specifying non-H2O cooling fluids) and
that the temperatures (cooling from 235 degF to 200 degF) may be out of
range for the algorithms. Anyone see any flaws in this approach before I
propose it?

 

Thanks in advance.

Lynn:
 
You would need to contact Steve Gates (steve.gates at doe2.com) to assess
the algorithm concerns.
 
I believe you can adjust the flow rate proportionally for an non water
fluid simply based on density versus density of water. I have used this
to adjust flow where ethylene-glycol is mixed with the water.
 
Let us know how it worked.

cooler - no other building energy is of interest. I am thinking I may be
able to do this in eQuest, assigning a process load to the fluid cooler
after developing a schedule from the data I have and putting a meter on
the fluid cooler. My concerns are that the fluid is not water (I have
been unsuccessful in the past specifying non-H2O cooling fluids) and
that the temperatures (cooling from 235 degF to 200 degF) may be out of
range for the algorithms. Anyone see any flaws in this approach before I
propose it?

Thanks for the responses to my industrial fluid cooler question. It
turns out the curves in DOE2 are good for inlet temperatures no greater
than about 90 degF - I would be way out of bounds. A good point was also
made that fouling would probably be a serious matter at those elevated
temperatures. Back to the drawing board...

All,

 

I have a need to simulate the performance of a hypothetical fluid cooler
applied to a condenser of a distillation process. I am trying to
determine the energy consumption that is being avoided by the
installation of heat exchangers that are effectively serving the
condensing function. I have data to determine actual hourly values of
heat rejection (BTU/hr), fluid (not water) temperatures and flow rates
and should be able to obtain hourly weather data for the period
corresponding to the data. I can get design values for the fluid cooler
from a vendor. I only need to determine the energy consumed by the fluid
cooler - no other building energy is of interest. I am thinking I may be
able to do this in eQuest, assigning a process load to the fluid cooler

University of Plymouth, Faculty of Technology, School of Engineering

Applications are invited for an EPSRC-funded post as Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at the Environmental Building Group of the School of Engineering at the University of Plymouth starting in October 2008. The PDRA will take the lead in a research project that aims to enable facility managers to prepare and adapt their buildings to climate change.

Climate change is now recognized as the prime challenge of the 21st century. It is increasingly clear that there is a need to take action in order to adapt specific buildings to changing circumstances, in a cost-effective way. This research project will develop a novel approach to manage the risks posed to buildings by climate change. It will employ building simulation (coupled with uncertainty analysis) to quantify these risks, their consequences, and risk abatement options.

The successful candidate for this position will have a relevant track record and deep understanding of building energy simulation and building physics, including a PhD in this discipline and hands-on experience with a simulation engine like EnergyPlus or ESP-r. Experience with uncertainty analysis, risk management, software development/programming skills, and actual facility management will all be considered a plus for the position. The PDRA is expected to have excellent communication and organisational skills, allowing to maintain close links with project stakeholders (facility managers) and related research disciplines (eg climate change research, building services engineering).

This post is available from 1 October 2008 or as soon as possible thereafter for a maximum period of 24 months.

Salary ?29138 to ?33780 pa - Grade 7
Interviews will be held on Wednesday 17 September 2008.

Hi John, and all,

 

I had the same question as Mona regarding how to model spaces that connect
multiple floors (such as an atrium).

This would require creating donut-shaped floors. I used to use VisualDOE,
and I understood that you would have an issue

if you create a donut-shaped floor - the software would not accept it (or am
I right?)

 

Are there similar issues in eQuest, and what are the techniques to use to
model a space of multiple floor height?

In eQuest, can we create a zone in a floor and make it "open to below" like
how you could do it in VisualDOE?

 

 

Thanks a lot.

George

My suggestion (not knowing the level of your modeling experience) is to
model the entire 26 floors in the Schematic design (all same size). You will
only see Floors 1, 2 and 26, as Floor 2 will be represented by a multiplier.

 

Then switch to detailed Design Wizard (DD Wizard) and begin adding each
floor above the 2nd as a "clone" of the previous floor. Once you get to
floor 25 and look at the building 3-D, you will now see all 26 floors.

 

NOW, staying in the DD Wizard, go back to floors 1 and 2, and, using the
Footprint definition on Wizard Screen 2, go to "Custom". This will allow you
to draw on a lattice where you can STRETCH the 1st floor, save it, and go to
Floor 2 to do the same thing.

 

You need to "play" with this a bit.

Hi,

 

I would like to model a 26storey   existing building with EQuest, however
the plans  are in pdf format, and I am not sure if I need to redraw them in
autocad.  the first two floors has different shape and part of the 2nd
floor is connected to 1st floor as a 2 storey gallery and there are 2
parking under ground(under first floor). I am wondering if I should model
the whole building in the schematic design without the first 2 floors and
parkings and then add them to the building? 

Building is rectangular in shape and the 24 story is expanded over the first
2 floor.

 

How can I model the 2 connected story? and how can I put these 2 stories
under the whole building.

 

Thanks alot,

Mona A.

Dear Vikram,
 
Although I know nothing about GC equipment, physics mandates that all energy
which goes into almost all mechanical / electrical devices becomes heat.
Your job is to a) figure out whether the heat ends up in the conditioned
space or elsewhere and b) figure out what the effective load diversity is
for your particular piece of equipment. (almost nothing operates 100% of the
time at 100% of its maximum energy.)
 
Forgive me if I'm too elementary here with a couple simple examples:
 
1) An exhaust fan motor imparts a certain amount of energy (its work energy)
to the exhaust air.  If the air ends up outdoors, that energy does not
affect the AC load.  In addition, the motor itself may be in the exhaust
airstream or outside it.  If it's in the airstream, the ~10% motor
inefficiency also ends up in the exhaust airstream.  If the motor is outside
the exhaust airstream, the ~10% ends up wherever the motor is located.
 
2) Similarly, an air handler fan motor imparts its work energy to the
airstream and therefore always becomes part of the AC load.  The motor
inefficiency, depending on the motor placement, may become part of the AC
load (or not).
 
A fine point in this consideration is that belt-driven motors always lose
~6-7% via the transmission (belt) system.  Most people forget about this.
 
I suspect that your GC equipment will dissipate all of its energy into the
space it occupies unless, for example, it is water-cooled, in which case the
water cooling system will remove some of the heat from the space in which it
is located.

What about the baseline envelope assemblies?  As an example I have an
existing building where the windows are being replaced and insulation is
being sprayed on the outside of a built up roof.   

 

In the same column of Table G3.1, requirement (b) states that "Opaque
assemblies used for alterations shall conform with 5.1.3" and requirement (c)
states that "The fenestration areas for envelope alterations shall reflect
the limitations on area, U-factor, and SHGC as described in 5.1.3."

 

5.1.3 states that "Alterations to the building envelope shall comply with the
requirements of Section 5 for insulation, air leakage, and fenestration
applicable to those specific portions of the building that are being
altered."

 

My interpretation is: because the windows and roof are being altered, I have
to use the appropriate U-factors and SHGC from the tables for the baseline
windows and roof.  However, the walls are not being altered, so I can use the
existing construction for the baseline walls.  

 

Does anybody have a different interpretation?

Mark, 
Under ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G, Table G3.1, Section 5, "Baseline Building
Performance" column, requirement (f) (take a breath...) it states that "For
existing building envelopes, the baseline building design shall reflect
existing conditions prior to any revisions that are part of the scope of work
being evaluated". So the rotation doesn't apply to you. Also, I interpret
that to mean the windows don't need to be redistributed either. Hope that
helps!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED modeling requirements for existing buildings

When modeling an existing building, is required to calculate the proposed
building window to wall ratio and equally redistribute the glass area to the
baseline building and prepare models for the four rotation exposures? My take
is that for a proposed existing building, there is not an opportunity to
position the building to the most advantageous exposure and you could end up
being penalized if the baseline energy use is averaged for all rotations but
I have not been able to find any reference in LEED or ASHRAE to support this.
I'm not sure what to think about equal redistribution of the glass areas.

Jay,
 
It is my understanding that that is the correct interpretation.  
 
However, I don't think Eric's interpretation that the baseline rotation
requirement does not apply to existing buildings is correct. Let me explain
why I disagree.  
 
Requirement f in Part 5 of Table 3.1 refers specifically to the baseline
building design (note the italics which signify that a phrase or word is
defined in Section 3 of the Standard) while Requirement a in Part 5 of Table
3.1 refers specifically to the baseline building performance (again in
italics).  The baseline building design is not the same as the baseline
building performance and therefore Requirement f. cannot supercede
Requirement a in any case.  
 
One last comment about the equal window distribution.  ASHRAE  90.1-2004
Addendum a removes the equal distribution requirement for windows in the
baseline.  If you're working on a LEED project I suggest you consider
adopting Addendum a to avoid this requirement.  USGBC has allowed the use of
ASHRAE 90.1-2004 addenda.  If you do decide to adopt Addendum a remember
that USGBC requires that you incorporate all the changes included in the
Addenddum.  Addendum a has a total of eight changes to Appendix G, most
important of which are the changes to the calculation of the baseline HVAC
system types.
 
regards,

Mark, 
Under ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G, Table G3.1, Section 5, "Baseline Building
Performance" column, requirement (f) (take a breath.) it states that "For
existing building envelopes, the baseline building design shall reflect
existing conditions prior to any revisions that are part of the scope of
work being evaluated". So the rotation doesn't apply to you. Also, I
interpret that to mean the windows don't need to be redistributed either.
Hope that helps!

When modeling an existing building, is required to calculate the proposed
building window to wall ratio and equally redistribute the glass area to the
baseline building and prepare models for the four rotation exposures? My
take is that for a proposed existing building, there is not an opportunity
to position the building to the most advantageous exposure and you could end
up being penalized if the baseline energy use is averaged for all rotations
but I have not been able to find any reference in LEED or ASHRAE to support
this. I'm not sure what to think about equal redistribution of the glass
areas.

Jay,
 
It is my understanding that that is the correct interpretation.  
 
However, I don't think Eric's interpretation that the baseline rotation
requirement does not apply to existing buildings is correct. Let me
explain why I disagree.  
 
Requirement f in Part 5 of Table 3.1 refers specifically to the baseline
building design (note the italics which signify that a phrase or word is
defined in Section 3 of the Standard) while Requirement a in Part 5 of
Table 3.1 refers specifically to the baseline building performance
(again in italics).  The baseline building design is not the same as the
baseline building performance and therefore Requirement f. cannot
supercede Requirement a in any case.  
 
One last comment about the equal window distribution.  ASHRAE  90.1-2004
Addendum a removes the equal distribution requirement for windows in the
baseline.  If you're working on a LEED project I suggest you consider
adopting Addendum a to avoid this requirement.  USGBC has allowed the
use of ASHRAE 90.1-2004 addenda.  If you do decide to adopt Addendum a
remember that USGBC requires that you incorporate all the changes
included in the Addenddum.  Addendum a has a total of eight changes to
Appendix G, most important of which are the changes to the calculation
of the baseline HVAC system types.

What about the baseline envelope assemblies?  As an example I have an
existing building where the windows are being replaced and insulation is
being sprayed on the outside of a built up roof.   

 

In the same column of Table G3.1, requirement (b) states that "Opaque
assemblies used for alterations shall conform with 5.1.3" and
requirement (c) states that "The fenestration areas for envelope
alterations shall reflect the limitations on area, U-factor, and SHGC as
described in 5.1.3."

 

5.1.3 states that "Alterations to the building envelope shall comply
with the requirements of Section 5 for insulation, air leakage, and
fenestration applicable to those specific portions of the building that
are being altered."

 

My interpretation is: because the windows and roof are being altered, I
have to use the appropriate U-factors and SHGC from the tables for the
baseline windows and roof.  However, the walls are not being altered, so
I can use the existing construction for the baseline walls.  

 

Does anybody have a different interpretation?

 

Thanks!

I asked the USGBC for an interpretation (not an official CIR) on the
need for rotating an existing building for modeling purposes and the
response was that the existing building does in fact need to be rotated.

 

This is their response (the "specified analysis" refers to building
rotation of an existing building):

 

If the existing building being renovated is pursuing LEED-NC rather than
LEED-EB, then it would indeed be required to undergo the specified
analysis.  This analysis is used to establish the baseline for energy
performance using the ASHRAE standard.  LEED doesn't have any specific
exemptions for existing buildings in this requirement, but if ASHRAE has
some kind of exemption, we will honor that.

Message-ID: <25F2BDB6656B8F40A1289ED906D6B5CF038E0E9E@EXCHANGE1.cadd_group.ghtltd.com>

I've got a building that cools with shutoff VAV boxes and heats with
perimeter hydronic baseboard heaters.
 
When I'm setting up my system, do I specify hot water baseboard heaters
and leave the Zone Heat Source set to "Not Installed", or do I specify a
hot water loop for the Zone Heat Source, and eQuest knows to apply this
to the baseboard heaters and NOT the shutoff VAV boxes?
 
I currently have the Zone Heat Source as "Not Installed", but it appears
from my SS-R reports that there are hundreds of hours of underheating,
so something is not working correctly.  I've had my hot water loop set
to snap, demand, and scheduled, so I think the loop is running
correctly.
 
Thanks in advance!

In my opinion, baseboards act a little funny in eQUEST.  This is how
I've made the scenario you describe work:  

 

Under the Heating tab of your unit (Coil Cap/Control), restore the
default in the reheat entry so it is blank.  Make sure the Hot Water
Loop is still enabled as the zone heating source though.  Under the
Preheat/Baseboard tab, specify Baseboard Source as the Hot Water Loop.
You can change the default entries for the baseboards (pressure drop,
delta T, valve, etc.)  if applicable.  Then for each perimeter zone, go
into the heating tab and change the Baseboard control to Thermostatic if
it isn't already selected.  I've had trouble getting the Outdoor Reset
selection to work and most of our projects have baseboards controlled by
thermostats anyway.  You can also enter the capacity of the baseboards
for each zone or let the system self-size.  This should work...if not
I'd be happy to look at the inp.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Baseboard heaters in VAV system

 

I've got a building that cools with shutoff VAV boxes and heats with
perimeter hydronic baseboard heaters.

 

When I'm setting up my system, do I specify hot water baseboard heaters
and leave the Zone Heat Source set to "Not Installed", or do I specify a
hot water loop for the Zone Heat Source, and eQuest knows to apply this
to the baseboard heaters and NOT the shutoff VAV boxes?

 

I currently have the Zone Heat Source as "Not Installed", but it appears
from my SS-R reports that there are hundreds of hours of underheating,
so something is not working correctly.  I've had my hot water loop set
to snap, demand, and scheduled, so I think the loop is running
correctly.

 

Thanks in advance!

I was under the impression that eQUEST either doesn't size baseboards
correctly or at all.  The few times I've had to use baseboards I have had
to solve the underheated hours by manually sizing the baseboard heaters at
the zone level.  It's a pretty tedious process.

Table G3.1 item 5(f) indicates that you would use the U-factors and SHGC
from the existing building envelope prior to any revisions that are part
of the scope of work being evaluated. Someone please straighten me out
on this because I'm having a hard time understanding how it could be
interpreted that you need to use the minimum U-factors and SHGC from the
tables in Section 5 for the baseline building regardless of whether
those envelope components are being altered or not.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Unusual Decrease in Heating Demand
Message-ID: <48AD4D67.9C66.007B.0@auseea.com>

I am modeling a core and shell building for LEED.  The baseline has a significant heating demand (kW), but in my design the heating demand is largely decreased causing a 10.5% kWh energy savings but a 24.8% cost savings with kW at $14 per.   In the baseline I am auto sizing packaged rooftop VSD with electric heat with EER 10.9.  With the design I am modeling DX coil, water cooled condenser, VSD with EER 14.57.  In the design I do have an ERV enthalpy wheel exchanging 6100 cfm (about half of the entire OA to the building).  In the baseline I have 50% fenestration, and in the design have 67% fenestration.  The only explanation for the decreased heating demand is the ERV, more solar load due to more glazing then baseline, or modeling error.  Anybody have any ideas?

Message-ID: <026001c903a8$a3bb4d00$cb11100a@BVM>

The way I understand it is as follows:

1.  All parameters in basecase and as designed case = existing conditions if
not being altered.  
2.  If improvements will be made to component X in the as designed case, the
basecase component X = 90.1 requirements.

So, for example, if the envelope is not being altered, set it to existing
conditions in both the basecase and as designed models if the information is
available.  Otherwise, you can use 90.1 values in both models.  If the
glazing is going to be updated as part of the renovation, the basecase =
90.1 requirements, the as designed case = new glazing.  

A similar situation applies to system improvements.  For example, if a VFD
is going to be added to the cooling tower fan, the basecase will need to be
modeled as a two-speed fan per the requirements of 90.1, regardless of what
is existing.

Essentially, the existing building basecase becomes a moving target as
energy improvements are considered.  

If feel this is incorrect, please let me know.

My interpretation is different. Table G3.1 5(f) says for the building
envelope only: 

 "...the baseline building design shall reflect conditions PRIOR to any
revisions that are part of the scope of work being evaluated."

So, if I read this right, the baseline reflects the as-is conditions and
the design case reflects the new conditions. Now when there are
additions, such as adding an atrium or more space, then the baseline
becomes 90.1 because there was nothing there before.

The way I understand it is as follows:

1.  All parameters in basecase and as designed case = existing
conditions if
not being altered.  
2.  If improvements will be made to component X in the as designed case,
the
basecase component X = 90.1 requirements.

So, for example, if the envelope is not being altered, set it to
existing
conditions in both the basecase and as designed models if the
information is
available.  Otherwise, you can use 90.1 values in both models.  If the
glazing is going to be updated as part of the renovation, the basecase =
90.1 requirements, the as designed case = new glazing.  

A similar situation applies to system improvements.  For example, if a
VFD
is going to be added to the cooling tower fan, the basecase will need to
be
modeled as a two-speed fan per the requirements of 90.1, regardless of
what
is existing.

Essentially, the existing building basecase becomes a moving target as
energy improvements are considered.  

If feel this is incorrect, please let me know.

Table G3.1 item 5(f) indicates that you would use the U-factors and SHGC
from the existing building envelope prior to any revisions that are part
of
the scope of work being evaluated. Someone please straighten me out on
this
because I'm having a hard time understanding how it could be interpreted
that you need to use the minimum U-factors and SHGC from the tables in
Section 5 for the baseline building regardless of whether those envelope
components are being altered or not.

I thought that the rotation requirement was gone in any case.

Message-ID: <444E10E864EC2E41ADF26EFCB697C7C3039899D5@EXCHCLUST.hei.hargis.biz>

 
All,

"Table 1.3 -- Advisory Messages" of the LEED NC Submittal Template
requests "number of hours heating loads not met" and "number of hours
cooling loads not met".  We've taken a vote here in the office, and its
2-0 in favor of reporting the worst case zone as shown on the BEPS
report.

But we have some lingering doubts... can anyone say definitively what
numbers are being asked to for here?  our runner-up in the voting was
the total of all zone hours out of throttling range -- however this
could easily exceed the limit of 300 hours on a large project with many
zones.  

As 300 hours is less than 5% (3.4% actually) of 8760, we think that the
300 hours is "per zone", not a total limit for the entire project.  

Comments appreciated....

Brandon and All,

I believe that they mean from G3.1.2.2 that each hour (of the 8760) for
which there is at least one zone where the load is not met should be
accounted for (meaning that in eQuest for example, your PERCENT OF HOURS
ANY SYSTEM ZONE OUTSIDE OF THROTTLING RANGE of the BEPS report should
not exceed 3.4). And that truly penalizes buildings with many zones as
you write.

Personally, I think that it is more realistic to just consider the
"worst case zone".

I believe Jeff has it right regarding the envelope requirements. The
reference guide for LEED NC 2.2 does write (page 186a): "For existing
buildings that are being renovated, the building envelope design
parameters for the Baseline Design should be modeled using the existing
(pre-retrofit) building envelope thermal parameters rather than the
ASHRAE Std. 90.1 prescriptive building envelope requirements for the
specified climate. Any proposed changes to the building envelope (such
as replacing windows or increasing roof insulation) should be modeled in
the Proposed Design."

Dear All,

I was looking for something else and found this in a LEED-NC EAc1 update
document that I downloaded, but can no longer find on the USGBC site: 

"For existing buildings that are being renovated, the building envelope
design parameters for the
Baseline Design should be modeled using the existing (pre-retrofit) building
envelope thermal
parameters rather than the ASHRAE Std. 90.1 prescriptive building envelope
requirements for the
specified climate. Any proposed changes to the building envelope (such as
replacing windows or
increasing roof insulation) should be modeled in the Proposed Design."

My interpretation is different. Table G3.1 5(f) says for the building
envelope only: 

 "...the baseline building design shall reflect conditions PRIOR to any
revisions that are part of the scope of work being evaluated."

So, if I read this right, the baseline reflects the as-is conditions and
the design case reflects the new conditions. Now when there are
additions, such as adding an atrium or more space, then the baseline
becomes 90.1 because there was nothing there before.

The way I understand it is as follows:

1.  All parameters in basecase and as designed case = existing
conditions if
not being altered.  
2.  If improvements will be made to component X in the as designed case,
the
basecase component X = 90.1 requirements.

So, for example, if the envelope is not being altered, set it to
existing
conditions in both the basecase and as designed models if the
information is
available.  Otherwise, you can use 90.1 values in both models.  If the
glazing is going to be updated as part of the renovation, the basecase =
90.1 requirements, the as designed case = new glazing.  

A similar situation applies to system improvements.  For example, if a
VFD
is going to be added to the cooling tower fan, the basecase will need to
be
modeled as a two-speed fan per the requirements of 90.1, regardless of
what
is existing.

Essentially, the existing building basecase becomes a moving target as
energy improvements are considered.  

If feel this is incorrect, please let me know.

Table G3.1 item 5(f) indicates that you would use the U-factors and SHGC
from the existing building envelope prior to any revisions that are part
of
the scope of work being evaluated. Someone please straighten me out on
this
because I'm having a hard time understanding how it could be interpreted
that you need to use the minimum U-factors and SHGC from the tables in
Section 5 for the baseline building regardless of whether those envelope
components are being altered or not.

I thought that the rotation requirement was gone in any case.

	Heating/Cooling Hours Loads Not Met

Brandon, I have been on the same page regarding this issue, and have
submitted for successful LEED certifications using those assumptions ...
until I read Addendum a to 90.1-2004, which adds the definition of
"unmet load hour" to Section 3.2.  The definition is:

unmet load hour: an hour in which one or more zones is outside of the
thermostat setpoint range.

Unfortunately this seems to clearly indicate the unmet load hour value
asked for refers to all zones at once.  

My previous assumptions to only consider the worst-case zone were based
on the example set forth by the USGBC's document titled "Example LEED-NC
v2.1 Energy & Atmosphere Credit 1 Submittal", which I referenced back
when I did my first LEED submittal in 2005.  This document is still
available from their server at the following address:

http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=2423

This document uses the following paragraph to demonstrate compliance
with the unmet load hour requirement:

"The worst-case zone in the budget case is a North classroom. This zone
is under-heated 40 hours out of the year in the Energy Cost Budget case
and 0 hours per year in the Design Energy Cost case. This is within the
50 hour per year limit required by ASHRAE 90.1-1999."

Now, if Addendum a were not used in any part as basis for LEED submittal
one could possibly argue using the quoted precedent above.  Granted, the
above precedent applied to the 1999 version of 90.1 and the 2.1 version
of LEED, but it seems to reasonable that the implications made there
should carry over until otherwise directed (as in Addendum a).
Furthermore, it is my opinion that 90.1-2004 (not including addendums)
does not clearly resolve the issue.  The ASHRAE technical committee must
have agreed, hence the inclusion of the new definition for "unmet load
hour" in Addendum a.

So, if Addendum a is not used, there may be a possibility to consider
unmet load hour only on a worst-zone basis.  However, if Addendum a is
used it seems clear that the unmet load hour applies to all zones at
once.

Certainly larger project simulations with multiple zones will suffer
from this added definition.

Thanks,

 Dan Russell, EIT

Loads Not Met

 
All,

"Table 1.3 -- Advisory Messages" of the LEED NC Submittal Template
requests "number of hours heating loads not met" and "number of hours
cooling loads not met".  We've taken a vote here in the office, and its
2-0 in favor of reporting the worst case zone as shown on the BEPS
report.

But we have some lingering doubts... can anyone say definitively what
numbers are being asked to for here?  our runner-up in the voting was
the total of all zone hours out of throttling range -- however this
could easily exceed the limit of 300 hours on a large project with many
zones.  

As 300 hours is less than 5% (3.4% actually) of 8760, we think that the
300 hours is "per zone", not a total limit for the entire project.  

Comments appreciated....

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] LEED NC Submittal Template,Heating/Cooling Hours
Loads Not Met

Brandon, I have been on the same page regarding this issue, and have
submitted for successful LEED certifications using those assumptions ...
until I read Addendum a to 90.1-2004, which adds the definition of
"unmet load hour" to Section 3.2.  The definition is:

unmet load hour: an hour in which one or more zones is outside of the
thermostat setpoint range.

Unfortunately this seems to clearly indicate the unmet load hour value
asked for refers to all zones at once.  

My previous assumptions to only consider the worst-case zone were based
on the example set forth by the USGBC's document titled "Example LEED-NC
v2.1 Energy & Atmosphere Credit 1 Submittal", which I referenced back
when I did my first LEED submittal in 2005.  This document is still
available from their server at the following address:

http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=2423

This document uses the following paragraph to demonstrate compliance
with the unmet load hour requirement:

"The worst-case zone in the budget case is a North classroom. This zone
is under-heated 40 hours out of the year in the Energy Cost Budget case
and 0 hours per year in the Design Energy Cost case. This is within the
50 hour per year limit required by ASHRAE 90.1-1999."

Now, if Addendum a were not used in any part as basis for LEED submittal
one could possibly argue using the quoted precedent above.  Granted, the
above precedent applied to the 1999 version of 90.1 and the 2.1 version
of LEED, but it seems to reasonable that the implications made there
should carry over until otherwise directed (as in Addendum a).
Furthermore, it is my opinion that 90.1-2004 (not including addendums)
does not clearly resolve the issue.  The ASHRAE technical committee must
have agreed, hence the inclusion of the new definition for "unmet load
hour" in Addendum a.

So, if Addendum a is not used, there may be a possibility to consider
unmet load hour only on a worst-zone basis.  However, if Addendum a is
used it seems clear that the unmet load hour applies to all zones at
once.

Certainly larger project simulations with multiple zones will suffer
from this added definition.

Thanks,

 Dan Russell, EIT

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED NC Submittal Template,Heating/Cooling Hours
Loads Not Met

 
All,

"Table 1.3 -- Advisory Messages" of the LEED NC Submittal Template
requests "number of hours heating loads not met" and "number of hours
cooling loads not met".  We've taken a vote here in the office, and its
2-0 in favor of reporting the worst case zone as shown on the BEPS
report.

But we have some lingering doubts... can anyone say definitively what
numbers are being asked to for here?  our runner-up in the voting was
the total of all zone hours out of throttling range -- however this
could easily exceed the limit of 300 hours on a large project with many
zones.  

As 300 hours is less than 5% (3.4% actually) of 8760, we think that the
300 hours is "per zone", not a total limit for the entire project.  

Comments appreciated....

 I am inclined to agree with Amanda on this issue.   

Appendix G is a methodology for demonstrating energy performance beyond the
minimum requirements of ASHRAE 90.1.  If you alter a building envelope
element and want to claim energy savings beyond the minimum performance
requirements of ASHRAE 90.1-2004 then the baseline HAS to be ASHRAE
90.1-2004 minimum performance.  Otherwise you are no longer making a
comparison to ASHRAE 90.1-2004.  

LEED v2.2 EA-1 credits are based on a comparison to an ASHRAE 90.1-2004
baseline.  This fact should supersede the apparent contradiction in Appendix
G that is being discussed.

Mike

Dear All,

I was looking for something else and found this in a LEED-NC EAc1 update
document that I downloaded, but can no longer find on the USGBC site: 

"For existing buildings that are being renovated, the building envelope
design parameters for the Baseline Design should be modeled using the
existing (pre-retrofit) building envelope thermal parameters rather than the
ASHRAE Std. 90.1 prescriptive building envelope requirements for the
specified climate. Any proposed changes to the building envelope (such as
replacing windows or increasing roof insulation) should be modeled in the
Proposed Design."

My interpretation is different. Table G3.1 5(f) says for the building
envelope only: 

 "...the baseline building design shall reflect conditions PRIOR to any
revisions that are part of the scope of work being evaluated."

So, if I read this right, the baseline reflects the as-is conditions and the
design case reflects the new conditions. Now when there are additions, such
as adding an atrium or more space, then the baseline becomes 90.1 because
there was nothing there before.

The way I understand it is as follows:

1.  All parameters in basecase and as designed case = existing conditions if
not being altered.  
2.  If improvements will be made to component X in the as designed case, the
basecase component X = 90.1 requirements.

So, for example, if the envelope is not being altered, set it to existing
conditions in both the basecase and as designed models if the information is
available.  Otherwise, you can use 90.1 values in both models.  If the
glazing is going to be updated as part of the renovation, the basecase =
90.1 requirements, the as designed case = new glazing.  

A similar situation applies to system improvements.  For example, if a VFD
is going to be added to the cooling tower fan, the basecase will need to be
modeled as a two-speed fan per the requirements of 90.1, regardless of what
is existing.

Essentially, the existing building basecase becomes a moving target as
energy improvements are considered.  

If feel this is incorrect, please let me know.

Table G3.1 item 5(f) indicates that you would use the U-factors and SHGC
from the existing building envelope prior to any revisions that are part of
the scope of work being evaluated. Someone please straighten me out on this
because I'm having a hard time understanding how it could be interpreted
that you need to use the minimum U-factors and SHGC from the tables in
Section 5 for the baseline building regardless of whether those envelope
components are being altered or not.

Appendix G is very explicit regarding these issues.  Amanda's interpretation
is not consistent with Appendix G (though any mandatory envelope measures
applicable to "alterations/additions") would still apply for the LEED
Prerequisite (EAp2)).

The relevant sections of Appendix G include:


   - Table G3.1.5(Baseline)(f): All elements of the existing Baseline
   building envelope shall reflect the existing conditions prior to any
   revisions that are part of the scope of work being evaluated.  [Notes: [1]
   this only includes existing portions of the building, and does not apply to
   building additions; [2] there is no exception mandating that elements with
   changes that are part of the scope of work must be modeled as meeting
   minimum ASHRAE prescriptive envelope requirements].
   - Table G3.1.5(Proposed): The building envelope shall be modeled as shown
   on architectural drawings or as built for existing building envelopes (any
   changes to the existing building envelope reflected on the architectural
   drawings would be reflected in the Proposed Case).

I am not certain, but I think the unmet load hours on the BEPS report is
consistent with the definition in Addendum a.  The BEPS report says "Percent
of hours any system zone outside of throttling range."  To me this is the
same as "one or more zones" being out of range for a particular hour.  

Adding up the unmet load hours of every zone would count a lot of coincident
unmet hours and could get large with a lot of systems (note this is what SS-R
does for multiple zone systems).  It could be greater than 8760, and I don't
think this is what appendix G is looking for.  If a lot of zones are out of
range during an hour (say an exceptionally cold night) that should only count
as 1 hour.

I don't think that the number on the BEPS is for the "worst case zone."  I
just checked a SIM file I had open and the BEPS report listed 3.3% unmet load
hours, so 289 hours (actually anywhere from 285-293).  Looking through SS-R
for each zone, the worst case had 177 hours under heated + 24 hours under
cooled, so 201 total unmet hours.

I have always gone by the BEPS (i.e. 3.4% or less is good), but have never
known how to find more detailed output regarding how many are cooling vs. how
many are heating.  Theoretically I think you could do this with an hourly
report for every zone and some postprocessing, but I don't really want to go
there.  Anybody have a more practical approach?

Brandon, I have been on the same page regarding this issue, and have
submitted for successful LEED certifications using those assumptions ...
until I read Addendum a to 90.1-2004, which adds the definition of
"unmet load hour" to Section 3.2.  The definition is:

unmet load hour: an hour in which one or more zones is outside of the
thermostat setpoint range.

Unfortunately this seems to clearly indicate the unmet load hour value
asked for refers to all zones at once.  

My previous assumptions to only consider the worst-case zone were based
on the example set forth by the USGBC's document titled "Example LEED-NC
v2.1 Energy & Atmosphere Credit 1 Submittal", which I referenced back
when I did my first LEED submittal in 2005.  This document is still

This document uses the following paragraph to demonstrate compliance
with the unmet load hour requirement:

"The worst-case zone in the budget case is a North classroom. This zone
is under-heated 40 hours out of the year in the Energy Cost Budget case
and 0 hours per year in the Design Energy Cost case. This is within the
50 hour per year limit required by ASHRAE 90.1-1999."

Now, if Addendum a were not used in any part as basis for LEED submittal
one could possibly argue using the quoted precedent above.  Granted, the
above precedent applied to the 1999 version of 90.1 and the 2.1 version
of LEED, but it seems to reasonable that the implications made there
should carry over until otherwise directed (as in Addendum a).
Furthermore, it is my opinion that 90.1-2004 (not including addendums)
does not clearly resolve the issue.  The ASHRAE technical committee must
have agreed, hence the inclusion of the new definition for "unmet load
hour" in Addendum a.

So, if Addendum a is not used, there may be a possibility to consider
unmet load hour only on a worst-zone basis.  However, if Addendum a is
used it seems clear that the unmet load hour applies to all zones at
once.

Certainly larger project simulations with multiple zones will suffer
from this added definition.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED NC Submittal Template,Heating/Cooling Hours
Loads Not Met

 
All,

"Table 1.3 -- Advisory Messages" of the LEED NC Submittal Template
requests "number of hours heating loads not met" and "number of hours
cooling loads not met".  We've taken a vote here in the office, and its
2-0 in favor of reporting the worst case zone as shown on the BEPS
report.

But we have some lingering doubts... can anyone say definitively what
numbers are being asked to for here?  our runner-up in the voting was
the total of all zone hours out of throttling range -- however this
could easily exceed the limit of 300 hours on a large project with many
zones.  

As 300 hours is less than 5% (3.4% actually) of 8760, we think that the
300 hours is "per zone", not a total limit for the entire project.  

Comments appreciated....

Hi Carol, 

Do you have a refrenece for the relaxation of the rotation requirement?
The arbitrary rotation requirement has been one of my pet peeves for a
long time, and any information you have confirming its demise would be
welcome news...;-)

Thanks

I was under the impression that eQUEST either doesn't size baseboards
correctly or at all.  The few times I've had to use baseboards I have
had to solve the underheated hours by manually sizing the baseboard
heaters at the zone level.  It's a pretty tedious process.

James---

 

In my opinion, baseboards act a little funny in eQUEST.  This is how
I've made the scenario you describe work:  

 

Under the Heating tab of your unit (Coil Cap/Control), restore the
default in the reheat entry so it is blank.  Make sure the Hot Water
Loop is still enabled as the zone heating source though.  Under the
Preheat/Baseboard tab, specify Baseboard Source as the Hot Water Loop.
You can change the default entries for the baseboards (pressure drop,
delta T, valve, etc.)  if applicable.  Then for each perimeter zone, go
into the heating tab and change the Baseboard control to Thermostatic if
it isn't already selected.  I've had trouble getting the Outdoor Reset
selection to work and most of our projects have baseboards controlled by
thermostats anyway.  You can also enter the capacity of the baseboards
for each zone or let the system self-size.  This should work...if not
I'd be happy to look at the inp.

I've got a building that cools with shutoff VAV boxes and heats with
perimeter hydronic baseboard heaters.

 

When I'm setting up my system, do I specify hot water baseboard heaters
and leave the Zone Heat Source set to "Not Installed", or do I specify a
hot water loop for the Zone Heat Source, and eQuest knows to apply this
to the baseboard heaters and NOT the shutoff VAV boxes?

 

I currently have the Zone Heat Source as "Not Installed", but it appears
from my SS-R reports that there are hundreds of hours of underheating,
so something is not working correctly.  I've had my hot water loop set
to snap, demand, and scheduled, so I think the loop is running
correctly.

 

Thanks in advance!

I have noted that the number of hours as per the % shown in the BEPS report is always slightly high than the actual. In a situation where you are close to 300 hours or 50 hours as applicable, it is best to check the SS-F reports and calculate the highest number of hours under-cooled or under-heated in any zone?for each month.?Adding the highest number for undercooled?in each month for each?zone and the highest number for underheated in each month for each zone will give the total number of unmet hours.
Consider only the highest number. Do not add all hours. That?could be even higher than 8760.

I am not certain, but I think the unmet load hours on the BEPS report is
consistent with the definition in Addendum a.? The BEPS report says "Percent
of hours any system zone outside of throttling range."? To me this is the
same as "one or more zones" being out of range for a particular hour.? 

Adding up the unmet load hours of every zone would count a lot of coincident
unmet hours and could get large with a lot of systems (note this is what SS-R
does for multiple zone systems).? It could be greater than 8760, and I don't
think this is what appendix G is looking for.? If a lot of zones are out of
range during an hour (say an exceptionally cold night) that should only count
as 1 hour.

I don't think that the number on the BEPS is for the "worst case zone."? I
just checked a SIM file I had open and the BEPS report listed 3.3% unmet load
hours, so 289 hours (actually anywhere from 285-293).? Looking through SS-R
for each zone, the worst case had 177 hours under heated + 24 hours under
cooled, so 201 total unmet hours.

I have always gone by the BEPS (i.e. 3.4% or less is good), but have never
known how to find more detailed output regarding how many are cooling vs. how
many are heating.? Theoretically I think you could do this with an hourly
report for every zone and some postprocessing, but I don't really want to go
there.? Anybody have a more practical approach?

Brandon, I have been on the same page regarding this issue, and have
submitted for successful LEED certifications using those assumptions ...
until I read Addendum a to 90.1-2004, which adds the definition of
"unmet load hour" to Section 3.2.? The definition is:

unmet load hour: an hour in which one or more zones is outside of the
thermostat setpoint range.

Unfortunately this seems to clearly indicate the unmet load hour value
asked for refers to all zones at once.? 

My previous assumptions to only consider the worst-case zone were based
on the example set forth by the USGBC's document titled "Example LEED-NC
v2.1 Energy & Atmosphere Credit 1 Submittal", which I referenced back
when I did my first LEED submittal in 2005.? This document is still
available from their server at the following address:

http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=2423

This document uses the following paragraph to demonstrate compliance
with the unmet load hour requirement:

"The worst-case zone in the budget case is a North classroom. This zone
is under-heated 40 hours out of the year in the Energy Cost Budget case
and 0 hours per year in the Design Energy Cost case. This is within the
50 hour per year limit required by ASHRAE 90.1-1999."

Now, if Addendum a were not used in any part as basis for LEED submittal
one could possibly argue using the quoted precedent above.? Granted, the
above precedent applied to the 1999 version of 90.1 and the 2.1 version
of LEED, but it seems to reasonable that the implications made there

Furthermore, it is my opinion that 90.1-2004 (not including addendums)

Certainly larger project simulations with multiple zones will suffer

under cooled, so 201 total unmet hours.

I have always gone by the BEPS (i.e. 3.4% or less is good), but have never
known how to find more detailed output regarding how many are cooling vs.
how many are heating.  Theoretically I think you could do this with an
hourly report for every zone and some postprocessing, but I don't really
want to go there.  Anybody have a more practical approach?

Hours Loads Not Met

Brandon, I have been on the same page regarding this issue, and have
submitted for successful LEED certifications using those assumptions ...
until I read Addendum a to 90.1-2004, which adds the definition of "unmet
load hour" to Section 3.2.  The definition is:

unmet load hour: an hour in which one or more zones is outside of the
thermostat setpoint range.

Unfortunately this seems to clearly indicate the unmet load hour value asked
for refers to all zones at once.  

My previous assumptions to only consider the worst-case zone were based on
the example set forth by the USGBC's document titled "Example LEED-NC
v2.1 Energy & Atmosphere Credit 1 Submittal", which I referenced back when I
did my first LEED submittal in 2005.  This document is still available from
their server at the following address:

http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=2423

This document uses the following paragraph to demonstrate compliance with
the unmet load hour requirement:

"The worst-case zone in the budget case is a North classroom. This zone is
under-heated 40 hours out of the year in the Energy Cost Budget case and 0
hours per year in the Design Energy Cost case. This is within the 50 hour
per year limit required by ASHRAE 90.1-1999."

Now, if Addendum a were not used in any part as basis for LEED submittal one
could possibly argue using the quoted precedent above.  Granted, the above
precedent applied to the 1999 version of 90.1 and the 2.1 version of LEED,
but it seems to reasonable that the implications made there should carry
over until otherwise directed (as in Addendum a).
Furthermore, it is my opinion that 90.1-2004 (not including addendums) does
not clearly resolve the issue.  The ASHRAE technical committee must have
agreed, hence the inclusion of the new definition for "unmet load hour" in
Addendum a.

So, if Addendum a is not used, there may be a possibility to consider unmet
load hour only on a worst-zone basis.  However, if Addendum a is used it
seems clear that the unmet load hour applies to all zones at once.

Certainly larger project simulations with multiple zones will suffer from
this added definition.

Thanks,

 Dan Russell, EIT

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED NC Submittal Template,Heating/Cooling Hours Loads
Not Met

 
All,

"Table 1.3 -- Advisory Messages" of the LEED NC Submittal Template requests
"number of hours heating loads not met" and "number of hours cooling loads
not met".  We've taken a vote here in the office, and its 2-0 in favor of
reporting the worst case zone as shown on the BEPS report.

But we have some lingering doubts... can anyone say definitively what
numbers are being asked to for here?  our runner-up in the voting was the
total of all zone hours out of throttling range -- however this could easily
exceed the limit of 300 hours on a large project with many zones.  

As 300 hours is less than 5% (3.4% actually) of 8760, we think that the 300
hours is "per zone", not a total limit for the entire project.  

Comments appreciated....

The definition of "unmet load hours" in Edition 3 of LEED-NC 2.2 (page
187) is "occupied periods where any zone is outside its temperature
setpoint". I noticed the words "occupied period". Does it mean the unmet
hours in "non-occupied periods" (e.g. at mid-night when no people in the
building) can be excluded? If I am right, the % in BEPS report counts
both occupied period and non-occupied period.

Mike and others;
The concept in the exception is that for a renovation project, the Standard does NOT REQUIRE replacement of existing crappy windows, for example. So the exception (f) gives credit for an improvement to something that could have been left in the same crappy condition and met the Standard. Even though, once you commit to changing them, the Standard indeed requires those new windows to have the minimum performance. Contradiction resolved in my mind. 
 
Fred

I am inclined to agree with Amanda on this issue.   

Appendix G is a methodology for demonstrating energy performance beyond the
minimum requirements of ASHRAE 90.1.  If you alter a building envelope
element and want to claim energy savings beyond the minimum performance
requirements of ASHRAE 90.1-2004 then the baseline HAS to be ASHRAE
90.1-2004 minimum performance.  Otherwise you are no longer making a
comparison to ASHRAE 90.1-2004.  

LEED v2.2 EA-1 credits are based on a comparison to an ASHRAE 90.1-2004
baseline.  This fact should supersede the apparent contradiction in Appendix
G that is being discussed.

Mike

"For existing buildings that are being renovated, the building envelope
design parameters for the Baseline Design should be modeled using the
existing (pre-retrofit) building envelope thermal parameters rather than the
ASHRAE Std. 90.1 prescriptive building envelope requirements for the
specified climate. Any proposed changes to the building envelope (such as
replacing windows or increasing roof insulation) should be modeled in the
Proposed Design."

My interpretation is different. Table G3.1 5(f) says for the building
envelope only: 

"...the baseline building design shall reflect conditions PRIOR to any
revisions that are part of the scope of work being evaluated."

So, if I read this right, the baseline reflects the as-is conditions and the
design case reflects the new conditions. Now when there are additions, such
as adding an atrium or more space, then the baseline becomes 90.1 because
there was nothing there before.

The way I understand it is as follows:

1.  All parameters in basecase and as designed case = existing conditions if
not being altered.  
2.  If improvements will be made to component X in the as designed case, the
basecase component X = 90.1 requirements.

So, for example, if the envelope is not being altered, set it to existing
conditions in both the basecase and as designed models if the information is
available.  Otherwise, you can use 90.1 values in both models.  If the
glazing is going to be updated as part of the renovation, the basecase =
90.1 requirements, the as designed case = new glazing.  

A similar situation applies to system improvements.  For example, if a VFD
is going to be added to the cooling tower fan, the basecase will need to be
modeled as a two-speed fan per the requirements of 90.1, regardless of what
is existing.

Essentially, the existing building basecase becomes a moving target as
energy improvements are considered.  

If feel this is incorrect, please let me know.

Table G3.1 item 5(f) indicates that you would use the U-factors and SHGC
from the existing building envelope prior to any revisions that are part of
the scope of work being evaluated. Someone please straighten me out on this
because I'm having a hard time understanding how it could be interpreted
that you need to use the minimum U-factors and SHGC from the tables in
Section 5 for the baseline building regardless of whether those envelope
components are being altered or not.

I thought that the rotation requirement was gone in any case.

There are two things that need to be separated.

   1. What are the Appendix G requirements for "unmet load hours"
   2. Where does one find the information from the output report of the
   software?



1. Appendix G requirements



The main purpose of this requirement is to ensure that the equipment is not
undersized and does not result in too high unmet load hours. Undersized
equipment consumes less energy along with resulting in large unmet load
hours (depending upon the location). Moreover, if the difference between the
baseline and proposed unmet load hours is high, it can either penalize or
benefit the savings (hence the requirement that the difference shall not
exceed 50 hours between the baseline and proposed case).



When one sizes equipment, it is done for the worse case scenario, meaning if
it can meet the loads of the worst zone then it would be able to meet the
loads of other zones. Therefore, looking at the worst zone would make sense.



Having said that, one also needs to keep in mind, there are various building
types using a variety of HVAC systems that use Appendix G. Some are 24/7
facilities and some are schools or offices, etc. Some use zonal systems and
some have an AHU per floor or one AHU for the whole building. I am not an
authority on Appendix G, however, to me it seems appropriate that the
Appendix G requirement is for the whole project and not for the worse zone.



For a large project, with large number of zones, the total unmet
cooling/heating hours can well exceed 8760. If this is what the simulation
results show then it is an indication-either the system is highly undersized
or there is something wrong with how the system has been modeled or both!



As a practice, I always look at the SS-R reports and add the unmet cooling
hours for the whole project and I maintain them well below 300 and similarly
I add all the unmet heating hours and maintain the total well below 300 for
the whole project. And I also make sure that the difference between both the
proposed and baseline is below 50 fro both heating and cooling. I formed
this habit when I was single and I didn't have a life. Although I am married
now, but I still maintain this habit (till my wife threatens to abandon me!)






2. Output from the simulation software (eQuest)



The BEPS/ BEPU reports show the worst zone scenario. Please look at SS-R
report; identify the worse zone- (the zone which has the largest unmet load
hours, determined by adding the unmet cooling and heating hours). Add unmet
cooling hours and unmet heating hours of this zone, divide this number by
the Total Run Hours also shown on the SS-R report and calculate the
percentage. The same percentage is reported on the BEPS/ BEPU reports as
"Percent of Hours Any System Zone Outside of Throttling Range".



The total run hours in the SS-R report equal the hours the fan operate (for
a typical office building the fans run 11 hours each day from 7am to 6pm).
Typically it would be ~2761 hours and not 8760 hours based upon the
following formula:

11hrs * 5 days/week * 52 weeks a year ? 11hrs * # of holidays + # of hours
during the unoccupied hrs when fans turn on to maintain setback temperature.


Thanks and Happy Friday!

Best regards,


Gaurav Mehta

I think the "Percent of Hours Any System Zone Outside of Throttling
Range" is rather the number of hours for which there is at least one
under-cooled or under-heated zone divided by 8760 (the eQuest commented
reports I have indicate that "The denominator used for this %
calculation is always 8760.")

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Spam:Re: LEED NC Submittal
Template,Heating/Cooling Hours Loads Not Met

 

There are two things that need to be separated.

1.	What are the Appendix G requirements for "unmet load hours"
2.	Where does one find the information from the output report of
the software? 

  

1. Appendix G requirements

 

The main purpose of this requirement is to ensure that the equipment is
not undersized and does not result in too high unmet load hours.
Undersized equipment consumes less energy along with resulting in large
unmet load hours (depending upon the location). Moreover, if the
difference between the baseline and proposed unmet load hours is high,
it can either penalize or benefit the savings (hence the requirement
that the difference shall not exceed 50 hours between the baseline and
proposed case).

 

When one sizes equipment, it is done for the worse case scenario,
meaning if it can meet the loads of the worst zone then it would be able
to meet the loads of other zones. Therefore, looking at the worst zone
would make sense.

 

Having said that, one also needs to keep in mind, there are various
building types using a variety of HVAC systems that use Appendix G. Some
are 24/7 facilities and some are schools or offices, etc. Some use zonal
systems and some have an AHU per floor or one AHU for the whole
building. I am not an authority on Appendix G, however, to me it seems
appropriate that the Appendix G requirement is for the whole project and
not for the worse zone.

 

For a large project, with large number of zones, the total unmet
cooling/heating hours can well exceed 8760. If this is what the
simulation results show then it is an indication-either the system is
highly undersized or there is something wrong with how the system has
been modeled or both!

 

As a practice, I always look at the SS-R reports and add the unmet
cooling hours for the whole project and I maintain them well below 300
and similarly I add all the unmet heating hours and maintain the total
well below 300 for the whole project. And I also make sure that the
difference between both the proposed and baseline is below 50 fro both
heating and cooling. I formed this habit when I was single and I didn't
have a life. Although I am married now, but I still maintain this habit
(till my wife threatens to abandon me!)  

 

 

2. Output from the simulation software (eQuest)

 

The BEPS/ BEPU reports show the worst zone scenario. Please look at SS-R
report; identify the worse zone- (the zone which has the largest unmet
load hours, determined by adding the unmet cooling and heating hours).
Add unmet cooling hours and unmet heating hours of this zone, divide
this number by the Total Run Hours also shown on the SS-R report and
calculate the percentage. The same percentage is reported on the BEPS/
BEPU reports as "Percent of Hours Any System Zone Outside of Throttling
Range".

 

The total run hours in the SS-R report equal the hours the fan operate
(for a typical office building the fans run 11 hours each day from 7am
to 6pm). Typically it would be ~2761 hours and not 8760 hours based upon
the following formula:

11hrs * 5 days/week * 52 weeks a year - 11hrs * # of holidays + # of
hours during the unoccupied hrs when fans turn on to maintain setback
temperature.

 

 

Thanks and Happy Friday!

 

Best regards,

 

 

Gaurav Mehta

The definition of "unmet load hours" in Edition 3 of LEED-NC 2.2 (page
187) is "occupied periods where any zone is outside its temperature
setpoint". I noticed the words "occupied period". Does it mean the unmet
hours in "non-occupied periods" (e.g. at mid-night when no people in the
building) can be excluded? If I am right, the % in BEPS report counts
both occupied period and non-occupied period.

Message-ID: <617408.15780.qm@web32606.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Dear All,
Does anybody have any experience with installing capacitors to reduce the power factor of your site?
Has that been used as an innovativation credit in LEED or does it have any implication on energy modelling?
My understanding is that it reduces transmission losses but does not affect the power consumption of the buildings.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
?

Kapil,
?
I think you are a bit confused. Ideally, power factor should?be?as high as possible?(up to 1.0) and reducing power factor always results in higher energy bills (i.e. losses). Capacitors help in increasing the power factor in the system, thus reducing losses.
?
Power factor improvement is one of the common measures in any energy conservation studies for buildings, at least in India. I wouldn't call this as an innovative measure to reduce energy costs.

Dear All,
Does anybody have any experience with installing capacitors to reduce the power factor of your site?
Has that been used as an innovativation credit in LEED or does it have any implication on energy modelling?
My understanding is that it reduces transmission losses but does not affect the power consumption of the buildings.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Kapil Upadhyaya.

Also to backup/justify Amanda's and Fred's posts -- if the project is a renovation where mechanical and lighting are replaced, but there are no envelope modifications, then the building permit probably excludes the envelope and 90.1 would not apply to those components.

It would make sense then to fill the parameters into both models as equal in both cases where it was excluded from the permit.

 Performance Rating Systems
Message-ID: <48B325B2.1080005@gard.com>

Announcing a new mailing list called BLDG-RATE created to 
enable people to exchange questions and answers relating to 
building performance rating systems.

BLDG-RATE is a mailing list for people using building 
performance rating systems. Discussions of any green 
building performance rating system or building energy 
performance rating system are welcome. Some of the most 
common rating systems include the LEED rating systems (New 
Construction, Existing Buildings, Homes, etc.), ENERGY STAR 
(Label for Buildings, Target Finder, Home), BREEAM, various 
Home Energy Rating Systems (HERS), and Green Globes. 
Building rating systems provide a method to objectively 
grade, or benchmark, the environmental and/or energy 
performance of both commercial and residential buildings 
providing a score that others can understand. Discussions of 
design-oriented as well as operation-oriented rating systems 
are encouraged. Many building rating systems are in use 
today and  conversations relating to any and all of them may 
take place on the mailing list. People of all experience 
levels ranging from those just learning to experts are urged 
to share their questions and answers on the mailing list.

To join BLDG-RATE send a blank email to:

   BLDG-RATE-subscribe at onebuilding.org

To learn more about BLDG-RATE go to:

They are based on published data from one of the major chiller
manufacturers.  While specific to that manufacturer, they are believed to be
representative of that class of chillers.

Message-ID: <cdf76d820808261410wf8b380cjee2c03bc034b6d49@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I was once in a presentation by Prof Martin Moeck that was a comparative
study of energy performances of various daylighting strategies. I vaguely
remember simple skylights like in Walmart performing better than roof
monitors with louvers or something to that effect.

I don't even know if there is a paper written up on the subject matter. I do
not have Prof Moeck's current contact information so I'm hoping to find him
or someone else who can help through this email.

Thanks,

Ramana - Our office provides project specific analyzes of daylight 
performance and its impacts on energy performance, also considering 
quality of light and other helpful studies. I don't know of Prof Moeck, 
but I'd be happy to discuss performance aspects of daylight with you.

Your statement of the "Walmart" skylights may be true for certain 
building types, taking into consideration the spectral and thermal 
nature of the glazing, the type heating/cooling for the space, as well 
as size, location, and distance from finished floor of the skylights in 
question. I'm sure they took a lot of this into consideration as they 
are always trying to maintain the lowest possible utility costs and for 
that building type those skylights may be the most beneficial.

The Consultant makes no warranty, express or implied, that the energy/daylight performance of the building will not vary from the Consultant's opinion of building energy/daylight performance.

Reports on toplighting and sidelighting studies by Moeck, et al. are here:

Martin went from industry to University of Kansas 
to Penn State (where the cited work was 
performed) to Arizona State back to industry.  I do not have a current address.

Hello everyone.

Recently I began learning how to use eQuest for building energy use
simulations.  I looked and was not able to find a forum style knowledge base
for the exchange of war stories/questions so I decided to create one
myself.  The URL for this website is www.energymodelhelp.com  It was not
until after I sent this to a few of my co-workers that I found out about
this email list.

I would like to invite you all to register and become members of the
community.  As of now, I realize it is a small community, but I imagine this
was a small email list at one point in time also.

In the future I would like to branch out into other energy modeling software
groups.  If you have expertise in other softwares, don't be afraid to ask
for a sub forum for your use.

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from all of you at
www.energymodelhelp.com.

Hi Adam,

I registered. The more sites the merrier! Are you also familiar with the 
BSUG mailing list? It's a Pacific Northwest group with a mailing list, 
regular monthly meetings, and special trainings. The monthly meetings 
can be accessed remotely as well as the trainings.

Cheers,
Carol

Hi,

I want to add another floor to my building, but I am already within the
detail interface. Is there a way that I could go back into the wizard and
create another floor without creating problems?

Thanks for any advise that can be provided!

You could do that within the detail interface.

Under "Building Shell", open up "Component Tree"

1) general default case, right click on "Mid Flrs", and select  
"Properties...."; all floors other than the top or ground floor are  
simply multiplier of the mid floor, you just add floor by changing the  
"Multiplier" in the properties screen.

2) if you would like to define floor by floor, right click on the  
"Project:...", and select "Create Floor ...." from the menu.

Bill,

                I ended up using a screw chiller because the scroll
chiller is positive displacement unit. I used a custom part load curve
(quadratic) based on a hypothetical manufacturer's performance at 100%,
75%, 50% & 25% load.

Eric,

 

Do you remember what you selected for the scroll chiller?  I need to
model one as well and I think I'll use the screw chiller selection
unless you have another suggestion.

 

Thanks,

Bill

		SIM List,

		                I need to model a scroll chiller (. Does
anyone have an opinion on which eQUEST chiller is a reasonable choice
for this? I was thinking that centrifugal would be the closest but this
is simply based on mechanical operation. I would like to choose the
closest model based on performance.

All,

I am currently modeling a facility in which steam is purchased from a distributor. ASHRAE says for the model, the baseline shall not be modeled with a boiler. Does anyone have any feedback as to the best approach to providing the steam without modeling a boiler system?

If its an identical floor, just use the 'floor multiplier' option on the
floor properties dialog of the floor you'd like to duplicate.  Then add
the floor height of the duplicated floor to the absolute Z elevations of
all floors above.  Note that the Z elevation is also found on the floor
properties dialog, of the respective floors that need to be jacked up.  
 
There's only one minor issue... the duplicated floor won't be depicted
graphically.  In 3-D geometry view, the building will look like there's
a missing floor.  But in all of the energy reports etc. you should find
that the duplicated floor is accounted for.
 
Now if the floor to be added is NOT identical... that's another can of
worms.  Let me know if this is the case and I can give you some
guidance... but it's not somewhere you want to go if you don't have to.

Hi,

I want to add another floor to my building, but I am already within the

and create another floor without creating problems?

Thanks for any advise that can be provided!

Matt,

                I believe that you can create a steam meter which will
represent purchased steam.  Right click on the top level of the project
tree under Water-Side HVAC tab and select, "Create Steam Meter...". as a
plant option. This will not, however, allow you to model any efficiency
losses from the distribution system (as far as I am aware).

I've reviewed definitions in ASHRASE 90.1-2004 and building codes and

Hi Bungane,
 
Yes, in Appendix G a high-rise residential building w/ heating source of
fossil fuel, fossil/electric hybrid, & purchased heat, the baseline system
is a PTAC.  If the heat source is electric or other, the baseline system is
a PTHP.

Bungane,

That depends on the proposed building's fuel type. If you are comparing
to an all electric system, the system 2 - PTHP would be the applicable
baseline system. But that has been the consensus from everyone I've
talked to here in Portland.

Are there any good articles out there on this topic?

To me, "calibration" would require loggers on the lighting, major HVAC
components and electrical panels to record such things as operating
schedules, temperatures and peak kW demand, and matching the model
results to the annual utility data, usually within 5% for annual
electrical consumption, gas use and electrical demand.  The model will
likely require several iterations to develop the calibrated baseline,
but then you have the increased confidence level in predicting "X% less
energy use" when you change "Y" in the baseline.

Here's a link to a post I did describing how to create a multi-floor
atrium... hopefully that's not what you need to do, since the only
simple way I know of to handle that is via the wizard.  
 
http://elcca-exchange.blogspot.com/search?q=atrium
 
Just as an FYI, we always always preserve a snapshot of our project at
the transition from wizard to detailed edit mode, in the event there
something we overlooked that's just more expedient to accomplish in the
wizard.
 
Is this an open mezzanine, where you could simply extend the floor to
floor height, and double-count key load factors, like lighting, people
and plug-load density?  That I think would be the simplest approach...
otherwise your going to need to add a floor, as Bruno suggested, in the
detailed editor.  
 
Better to copy an existing floor and delete unnecessary items then
create from scratch and add missing components manually, I think.
 
Hope that helps

	If its an identical floor, just use the 'floor multiplier'
option on the floor properties dialog of the floor you'd like to
duplicate.  Then add the floor height of the duplicated floor to the
absolute Z elevations of all floors above.  Note that the Z elevation is
also found on the floor properties dialog, of the respective floors that
need to be jacked up.  
	 
	There's only one minor issue... the duplicated floor won't be
depicted graphically.  In 3-D geometry view, the building will look like
there's a missing floor.  But in all of the energy reports etc. you
should find that the duplicated floor is accounted for.
	 
	Now if the floor to be added is NOT identical... that's another
can of worms.  Let me know if this is the case and I can give you some
guidance... but it's not somewhere you want to go if you don't have to.

A few other comments regarding calibration


 

Calibrating to annual utility use is better than nothing, but still not
worth much.  Calibrating to monthly utility bills can be pretty good, but
that is very dependent upon your goals.

 

First, note that DOE-2 and derivatives are (still, I believe) hourly
simulations.  (EnergyPlus can use shorter time steps.)  Utilities usually
bill demand based on a 15-minute period, or less commonly on a 30-minute
period.  Perhaps some bill on an hourly period, but I haven?t run into that.
Depending upon when the peak demand occurs, and what is causing it, the
15-minute and hourly peak demands can be VERY different.

 

Second, it is next-to-impossible to truly calibrate a building in the
absence of zonal energy use information.  VAV box operation and reheat can
be particularly problematic, but there are many other areas of concern.
Building simulation programs generally assume proper or at least decent
operation.  However, this is seldom the case:  economizers don?t work
properly, setpoints are suboptimal, there is simultaneous heating and
cooling due to leaking valves or other problems, etc.

 

A calibrated model MAY improve savings estimates for many retrofits, but
again, it depends upon whether the retrofit will be impacted by such
problems.  One example is a conversion of a system from constant flow to
variable flow.  First, most simulations don?t do a great job of simulating
variable speed pumping or VAV fan operation, although this is improving.
Second, most variable flow systems don?t operate optimally, and proper
operation is what we typically assume in simulation.

 

(For documentation of some of the issues with simulating variable flow
systems, refer to the dictionary for DOE2.2R at 

http://doe2.com/download/DOE-22/DOE22Vol2r-DictionaryRefrigeration.pdf

It states, in part, that 

?Pressure is not considered in the air-side calculations.  VAV fan power is
modeled using a simple curve without considering where the pressure drops
exist in the system, where the static pressure sensor is located, or what
the static setpoint is.?)

 

Put another way, it is pretty easy to simulate a constant flow system, and
the energy use for that system, since it is relatively unlikely that the
system won?t be operating as expected. However, a variable flow system is
likely to not be operating as expected, is not particularly well-modeled by
DOE-2, and hence the savings estimates from even a calibrated simulation
might not be very good.

 

This is not to discourage you from calibration?far from it.  Your model will
certainly be better after calibration, and you will learn a ton in the
process.  However, I encourage you to note the previous resources and
comments.  It certainly is VERY ?easy to underestimate the actual time
commitment required:?  In the early 1990s I performed multiple
research-level calibrations.  For one large building, I calibrated a DOE-2
model to hourly end-use AND zonal subsystem data as part of a research
project.  The process was months, not days.  That was a very detailed
calibration, but it demonstrated how a model calibrated to monthly data can
still be far from reality.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] More than 3 system types
Message-ID: <73032.78234.qm@web51509.mail.re2.yahoo.com>





Dear All,
I am simulating a 175000 sq ft office building in Houston that has a chilled water supply for cooling and electric reheat for heating. This office building has series fan powered boxes in the offices, VAV with electric reheat in the restrooms and fan coil units and no reheat in the mechanical units. 
1. Is there a way to simulate all 3 different system types in eQUEST? If so, how do we go about doing it in the detailed mode?
I tried assigning a system to a particular zone but it does not link to components.
2. 17% of hours are not within throttling range when the entire office building is just simulated with fan powered boxes. The perimeter zones are undercooled. However, I am not sure if an additional PIU can be installed in eQUEST to all the zones.
Any help will be greatly appreciated.

There is an easier way to get a calibrated simulation. Our firm 
provides EZSim -- a simplified simulation model developed 
specifically to calibrate to monthly utility bills. If one does not 
have interval or submetered data, why develop a model in more detail 
than you have data to support? EZSim computes one monthly result at 
the whole building level and uses actual (not TMY) weather data.  See 
http://www.ezsim.com/

Model fit can be quite good. The specification of  "5% of annual" is 
not meaningful in a statistical sense. I prefer to specify in terms 
of MSE. Note that the savings estimate is based on comparing two 
years (actual and baseline) so the standard errors add in quadrature. 
What does this mean? Monthly modeling at MSE of 5% gives an annual 
consumption estimate with MSE of 2%. Comparing two years for a 
savings estimate results in MSE of 5% of annual applied to the 
difference. A 90% Confidence Limit is .96 SE so we have a savings 
estimate of +/- 5%. Not too bad -- given that we should be looking at 
savings of, say 30%, a 5% confidence band is adequate. If you are 
looking at measures with smaller savings, there is not sufficient 
resolution. All this can be done very inexpensively using utility 
bills as the measurement in an hour or less.

The IMPVP referenced by FEMP and LEED fails to provide an adequate 
explanation or discussion if these precision issues. As far as I 
know, EZSim is the only modeling tool that reports MSE of the 
calibration fit and allows for confidence estimates. The caveat is 
that is does not explicitly provide for the myriad of design options 
available in a detailed model. However, the model can be tuned to 
match any other model. Note that it does so only at the monthly 
energy level, not at the hourly level.

Message-ID: <25F2BDB6656B8F40A1289ED906D6B5CF038E0EE2@EXCHANGE1.cadd_group.ghtltd.com>

I've got a mixed use project for a local university with both lab/office
space as well as a separate dorm area.  I'm using the whole building
area method to calculate baseline lighting levels, and for the
lab/lecture area, it's pretty straightforward...I just use 1.2 W / sq
foot for Schools/Universities.
 
However, for the dorms, what should I use?  Hotels and multi-family
areas have different allowed values (1.0 and 0.7 respectively).  And to
complicate it further, the Space-by-Space method actually lists "dorms"
and it has a value of 1.1.
 
I'd prefer not to have to do space-by-space...what would you categorize
student living as?  It's not really multi-family per se. 
 
Could I group the ENTIRE project into "school/university"?  I'm guessing
no...
 
Thanks!

James, 

 

The Building Area Method (Table 9.5.1) in 90.1-2004 lists Dormitory at
1.0 W/sf.  This should be your baseline value for the dorm area of the
project.

Does anyone have any experience modeling a valance unit system?  I am
looking to developed an energy model for LEED submission.  Any
suggestions, thoughts, past experiences?
 
Thanks!
