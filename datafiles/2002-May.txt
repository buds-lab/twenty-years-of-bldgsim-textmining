Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200205300905.AA052917pd80000155108@gard.com>

DOE has put together a bunch of case studies in their High 
Performance Buildings Database located at:  

http://www.eren.doe.gov/buildings/highperformance/case_studi
es/

What I found most interesting is that 16 of the 26 items in 
the database (as of today) mentioned energy simulation, 
energy modeling or a specific energy simulation program.  
The one mentioned most often was DOE-2.

Thanks for that, Jason - I hadn't looked at that site for a while and
there are quite a few new packages since then.

I can't help feeling that we need an equally comprehensive site for
weather data, detailing (amongst other things) the various formats
used....

I am studying was unable to generate a report which included the specific
heat load inside a space. I have not specified any mechanical system and
am simply studying the heat load through different types of glass
surfaces. How do I decide the different output paramters in EP
terminology.

Secondly the file failed to simulate when i used the detroit weather file
but worked when I used the chicago weather file even though I have
manually entered detroit weather data. Is there an explanation?

thank you

Ian,

The EnergyPlus format is not a binary but simply a text 
file and it is comma delimitted so it should go into a 
spreadsheet easily.  The fields in the file are described 
in the OtherInformation.PDF file that can be downloaded 
from the www.energyplus.gov site (click on the "weather and 
other utilities" link on the left under "other 
information").

Hey, Bldg-Sim folks,

I'm doing a TAS simulation on a building in Halifax, Nova Scotia Canada; and
EDSL, unfortunately, doesn't have a weather data file for that location.
Instead, they've provided me with a utility where I can create my input file
from data in an Excel spreadsheet.

I *do* have a weather data file in EnergyPlus format (apparently in or
derived from a CWECs / WYEC2 format); but I have no tool to open this binary
and export it to Excel.

Does anyone have any advice or experience with Square 1's WeatherTool, or
any other software that opens EnergyPlus, CWECS and/or WYEC2 file formats;
and can export to Excel?


Warm regards,
Ian Theaker, P.Eng.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200205220856.AA565050pd80000152034@gard.com>

Hi,
I am trying to create a heat exchanger in PowerDoe as that seems to be the way to model a dry cooler, or a fluid cooler that operates dry during cold weather.  However, every time I create a HX, either using the library or my own specs, it crashes the model as soon as it gets into the simulation of the HVAC equipment.  It spits out an error something like J < 0 in line 94....... 
Any suggestions on how to model a dry cooler?
The other thing I tried was modeling it as a fluid cooler but changing the capacity curve to derate the overall capacity- this doesn't seem to produce the result I want.
Thanks for any suggestions, this thing is driving me nuts!!

Sincerely,

Alec Stevens

The 1999 Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey 
(CBECS) Commercial Building Characteristics were released 
yesterday.  In case you aren't aware of this resource, it 
is the largest most comprehensive national survey of 
commercial buildings in the U.S. that I know of at over 
5000 buildings. It provides good information if you are 
trying to find out what the average size of a particular 
type of building or the fraction of floorspace nationally 
that uses chillers, etc.  DOE does the survey every three 
or four years so it has history.  Even better, the detailed 
building by building survey data is available if you want 
to do your own number crunching.  I have used it to create 
prototypical building descriptions in DOE-2 to perform a 
national assessment of the energy impact of ASHRAE 90.1-
1999.  

http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cbecs/char99/intro.html

The characteristics tables are followed a several months 
later by energy consumption statistics on the same set of 
buildings.

If anyone can think of other resources people use when 
putting together building simulation inputs, go ahead and 
share them with the group.

If you want to find a software tool concerning energy use 
in buildings, the U.S. Department of Energy has been 
keeping a list for many years.  Now we can get directly to 
that directory without remembering a long URL, just go to 
the following address and you get to the directory.

http://www.energytoolsdirectory.gov

An even shorter address to remember has a link to the 
directory right on the front page is:

http://www.energytools.gov

Remember the .gov on the last one because the .com goes to 
a different site.

This directory is the best list I know of although it does 
not include everything.

Hi,
I'm trying to debug the operation of a fluid cooler in PowerDoe by creating an hourly report.
So I create a report block for "Heat Rejection" and select my fluid cooler.
I'm looking for the actual capacity of the fluid cooler at the prevailing hourly conditions.
So my first guess was "Maximim thermal load on tower given current conditions"
But when I plotted the results vs. OA wetbulb temperature, the graph doesn't make sense.
Any suggestions as to what the correct hourly result series is?

Thanks

Sincerely,

hi,

I'm using DOE2.1E for making a comparison of a dynamic simulation and a static calculation by the VDI-2078. I have a question concerning the DOE2.1E-program.

Has anyone already remarked the difference between the values of an hourly simulation and a total value (for the entire building) for the conduction through window and frame? Has anyone an explanation for that phenomena. In the manual, they say that there is no algorithm for an hourly simulation of the conduction through window and frame. Is that the reason, or is there another one?

Yours sincerely,

Bart Callens

Dear Colleagues,

FiSIAQ and EQUA will arrange a two-day course on NMF modelling for IDA
Indoor Climate and Energy 3.0 in Helsinki, Finland on June 3 and 4. See
agenda on:

www.sisailmatieto.com/NMF-course.pdf

The course is intended both as an introduction to IDA/NMF/ICE
(www.equa.se/ice) for experienced building simulationists in general and
for IDA ICE users wanting to write their own component models.

Please contact Mika Vuolle (Mika.Vuolle at sisailmatieto.com) or Per Sahlin
(per.sahlin at equa.se) for more information and practical arrangements.

Best regards,

Mika Vuolle
