I was asked to complete a life cycle cost analysis comparing a boiler/chiller
system vs a geothermal system with a water to water heat pump.  I have all
the factors I need except the illusive O&M costs. (I have fuel cost,
installation cost, equipment cost....)

What I have done at this point is to contact the company which will actually
be doing the O&M.  (I went straight to the horse's mouth) but the campus only
has 1 building with a geo-thermal system and it is only 1 year old.  I think
if I can get a ratio comparing the O&M costs of a boiler/chiller vs
geothermal, I'd be done.  

Something as simple as "A geothermal system on average costs x% less in O&M
costs compared to a boiler/chiller system...." and somebody to site as to the
value of 'x'.

You might look at RS Means:
*	Life Cycle Costing for Facilities
*	Facilities Maintenance & Repair Cost Data
*	Facilities Cost Data
I do not personally have any of these, but I think they may have the
information you may need.

They also offer data online if you do not want to buy the book, they have a
free trial period.

John,

Linclon County Schools Study data (in 98 Dollars, ok for comparative
analysis, these included mostly water to air units, water to water will
be lower so data slightly favorable to chiller-boiler.:

GHP Maint Cost = 2.13$/yr/sq ft
Water Cooled Chiller w Gas Fired Hot Water Boiler $6.07/yr/Sq Ft

Otto,

We are finishing processing 2011 data now and will have a file available for the last 12 months for your site in Indianapolis in about a week – 10 days (if you can wait).  The .bin format is one of our standard formats included.  we have been working hard on this as a number of people are asking for this.

Best,  Chuck

*Commissioning Agent / Energy Auditor*

Location: New York, NY

Position Type: Full Time



*POSITION DESCRIPTION*

YRG is seeking a Commissioning Agent and/or Energy Auditor to support our
green building work on new and existing building projects. For new
construction projects, the candidate will perform all tasks associated with
building energy system commissioning as specified by LEED, including
pre-functional systems review, functional performance testing, review of OPR
and BOD, and writing commissioning reports. For existing facility projects,
the candidate will conduct ASHARE Level I and II energy audits,
re-commissioning, and provide recommendations for cost-effective efficiency
improvements.



In addition, the candidate will provide general support to YRG staff
(including energy modelers, design assistance providers, operations and
maintenance consultants), to inform the strategic and technical direction of
projects, and optimize those projects relative to the client’s
sustainability goals. Our goal is to provide a seamless transition from
design and energy modeling, through commissioning and operations to help
ensure that sustainability goals are seen through to the long term.



Knowledge of the ASHRAE-90.1 energy codes, LEED green building rating
systems, and NYSERDA incentive programs are a must.



*QUALIFICATIONS *

The candidate should have a MEP engineering background, significant
experience (at least 3 years) working in a related field (building science,
MEP, etc.), completed at least five commissioning, energy audits, or
retro-commissioning projects as the lead on those projects, and a relevant
accreditation in the field (e.g. Certified Energy Manager, BCxA), etc.



The candidate should have knowledge of building energy systems (shell,
lighting, HVAC, controls) and efficiency measures. The ideal candidate will
have strong analytical skills, as well as strong communication skills, and
be both willing and able to support project teams in all aspects of building
design and operation.



Additional preferred technical knowledge and experience could include:

§  Renewable energy technologies and analytical models

§  Direct experience with the LEED-EB:OM and LEED-NC Rating Systems

§  Cost-benefit analyses

§  New Jersey, LIPA, CT, and federal rebates and incentives for energy
efficiency and renewable energy



Lastly, the successful candidate should exhibit strong time management,
organizational, and presentation skills; be flexible to changes in deadlines
and work focus; and be highly self-motivated. This position will require
working independently as well as closely with other staff members and
members of multiple client project teams.



*SALARY*

Salary is commensurate with experience.



*CONTACT *

If interested, please send a resume and a work sample (sample Cx plan, audit
report, etc.) to Alice Mogck at amogck at yrgsustainability.com

Message-ID: <CAAkkLHEE=6gvSnmzGsXERmKc5gPjFneOH3OLVDTBFMOYgyujqQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

We have a building with a dedicated fresh air unit supplying tempered air to
compartment units on each floor which feed VAV boxes. Right now, this is
being modelled as a separate VAV unit for each floor, with the heating and
cooling capacities, fan power, etc. from the DOAS being distributed and
added to the cooling capacities, fan power, etc. of the compartment units. I
am not sure that this is the correct way to represent this system in EE4 and
would welcome suggestions/advise on how to best model this system.

Cheers,

I have also taken those areas in the exceptions as the entire building's, though I'd agree it's not worded clearly enough to prevent various interpretations.  

I'm not an English major, but I think if you could find a grammar guru they'd be able to cite something to the following effect: When a sentence's subject and object is not made clear by any other means in the structure/word choice, the word closest to the verb is the object affected by that verb.

These exceptions to the mandated vestibule (varying by climate zone) seem generally logical to me.  While vestibules in many cases will save energy, at some point a vestibule of minimum dimensions becomes a significant fraction of cost and useable space for small buildings... Vestibules and other infiltration mitigation (revolving doors) cost money in and of themselves and probably generally do less for a tiny building relative to the savings to be had with larger buildings having heavier regular entry traffic.  That's not to say a vestibule is a BAD idea for small buildings - savings will be proportional to the entry traffic: a small McDonald's will get much more out of an entry vestibule than an equally-sized storage facility.

I always interpreted this the other way -- if the space adjacent to the
opening was small, then it was itself the vestibule.

I can see your point about adding cost to a small building -- but 1,000 ft2
is so small relative the scale of most buildings that it seems like this is
describing a space to me.

The wording would normally be "located in a climate zone" AND "that are less
than 1,000 ft2" if you meant for them to be both referring to the
buildings...unless there is a possibility that the entrance is not in the
same climate zone as the rest of the building ;)

Since "AND" is not there, if you delete the wording about the climate zone
from the sentence, it seems to clearly refer to the entrances and not the
building.

"Building...that are less than 1,000 ft2..."  ---> grammar guru rejects this
one

"Building entrances...that are less than 1,000 ft2..."  ---> grammar guru
celebrates, saves energy, and provides great IEQ!

So that said...anyone check the User's Manual?  This seems like a good item
to be included.  Maybe also a COMCheck envelope compliance report, I don't
recall the exact wording used there.  Perhaps it prints out the AHJ's
checklist with clearer wording.  I don't remember if this is included in
that checklist off the top of my head though.

The correct interpretation is buildings less than 1000 sf.   The example cited earlier of a small stand alone restaurant is valid.

Exception g is the exception for individual spaces.

Sorry for the crammed in the standard.  So much of this text is old and does not always get the rewrite it deserves.

Hi,

 

You should use Built-up VAV (Assemblé DAV) as your system deserving your
thermal zones.  As you said, you can use distinct system for each floor and
making sure that you distribute adequately the heating, cooling capacities,
fan power, etc. for each dummy systems. Then you will have to specify the
fan control in the supply fan label and indicate the maximum allowable air
supply for each zone.

 

Regards,

 

Marc-Antoine Paquin, ing.

Objet : [Bldg-sim] Compartment units with DOAS (EE4)

 

Hello, 

 

We have a building with a dedicated fresh air unit supplying tempered air to
compartment units on each floor which feed VAV boxes. Right now, this is
being modelled as a separate VAV unit for each floor, with the heating and
cooling capacities, fan power, etc. from the DOAS being distributed and
added to the cooling capacities, fan power, etc. of the compartment units. I
am not sure that this is the correct way to represent this system in EE4 and
would welcome suggestions/advise on how to best model this system. 

 

Cheers,

  This would cause a  262. degree ZONE temperature change.   Values are being ignored.

  Check wall definitions for errors and report this inp/lib/wth to DOE-2 support.

Hello Bldg-Sim community,

I was wondering if someone could help me out with finding some Side-by-side
calculation results using an EnergyPlus-based tool and a DOE2.2-based tool
of DEER standard building types in California climate zones?    If any
research exists on this topic, could someone please point me towards it?  I
would really appreciate any help on this.

Thanks in advance,

I have a unique situation where the architect is taking an existing building
and majorly renovating it (definition of major per LEED is HVAC, envelope
and interior spaces) and then building an addition which is roughly the same
size of the existing building, give or take a 1000 sqft.

Has anyone run into this before or have any insight that might help me
explain which avenue to take to my boss?  I am currently thinking new
building, but if it was existing then that helps me even more.

The baselines for the existing portion are what is there now.

 

The baselines for the new portion (addition) are ASHRAE definitions.

 

This should help considerably in your overall energy efficiency gains.

 

It all comes down to % new vs. % existing, on how much you can gain.

Yes, I agree that i should use the existing envelope for the existing
conditions of the existing building and the ASHRAE Min for the new building.
 But it comes down to whether EA Credit 1 follows the new building % or the
existing building %.  it is a 2 point difference that could effect
strategies for saving energy later in the design.

You use the existing building criteria for % and points in LEED if your
existing portion is greater than  half of the whole project sq.ft. (existing
+ addition).

Yes, I agree that i should use the existing envelope for the existing
conditions of the existing building and the ASHRAE Min for the new building.
But it comes down to whether EA Credit 1 follows the new building % or the
existing building %.  it is a 2 point difference that could effect
strategies for saving energy later in the design.

I have a unique situation where the architect is taking an existing building

size of the existing building, give or take a 1000 sqft.

We have a building that is going to be under renovation of interior and mechanical and lighting. The building has an new addition that was not certified as LEED building and not part of the project. Any ideas if we can do Commercial Interior without including the addition?

Thanks.

I have a unique situation where the architect is taking an existing building and majorly renovating it (definition of major per LEED is HVAC, envelope and interior spaces) and then building an addition which is roughly the same size of the existing building, give or take a 1000 sqft.

Has anyone run into this before or have any insight that might help me explain which avenue to take to my boss?  I am currently thinking new building, but if it was existing then that helps me even more.

Yes, I agree that i should use the existing envelope for the existing
conditions of the existing building and the ASHRAE Min for the new
building.  But it comes down to whether EA Credit 1 follows the new
building % or the existing building %.  it is a 2 point difference that

Dear All,

Hope all are well.
Currently I have a ArchiCAD BIM model and need to perform energy modeling to
LEED compliant.
I wonder if anyone has worked on ArchiCAD BIM model before, mind to shed
some thoughts if the Ecodesigner module can perform LEED compliant modeling?
How about alternative softwares?

Since the facade has complex spiral 3D curvy shading system I doubt the
ability of EQuest or Energy Plus to model the geometry.
Appreciate some insightful thoughts from all the members out there.

Many thanks in advance.

Message-ID: <CAHpz=HR-rb8CC2dm2OpbTKGz_81DYLMWgd7u3Qy2Y0ZWa6K6Qg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,
         I created a custum curve for  DX system EIR=F(PLR)

Now as per doe2 manuual it is said that when we enter PLR say 0.9
itgives EIR as Power inputat (90Load/Power at full ie 100load)  so
like this  i had four values of part load at 0.7 .8 .9 and 1 and i
calculated the corrosponding EIR as Power at that load/full load power
and my EIR at different  load 0.7 ,0.8, 0.9 and 1 was0.5968,
0.7193,0.8537 and 1 respectively based on this values i created a
cubic curve for EIR as F(PLR)  but after making the custum curve my
cooling energy in end results is going up by 15% i dont know as far as
i think it should go down because at part load power consumption is
less.


So should  i enter EIR= as 1/cop at given load ,not as KWat given
load/Kw at full load.

Please give me some response.

Thanks
Sambhav.

Hello, 
 
I'm running simulation wih EnergyPlus.
In order to apply ECMs, I'm trying to apply insulation films to each window.
The object I used is WindowMaterial:Shade, but I don't think my way is correct. 
I have limited information (Available data include solar reflectance, visible reflectance/transmittance, and shading coefficient),
which is further complicating the situation. 
 
Any help will be much appreciated. 
Thank you.
 
 
_Jeong 
 
p.s. BTW, I do not understand why there's no shading coefficient field in window-related objects.

Hi Simon,

could you give some more information on the nature of that "complex 
spiral 3d shading system"? It would probably be intersting whether this 
is a light redirecting system, a solid structure or more like sheet, can 
be controlled or is static...

Cheers, Lars.

Jeong,

Shading coefficient is an older term that has been gradually substituted 
by the SHGC value. The object WindowMaterial:SimpleGlazingSystem allows 
you to enter this value directly. A quick search around the web shows 
that the SC should be around 1.15 * SHGC. But you should get some more 
reliable information on this. Also, it is recommended that you use the 
detailed input for windows and not the simple glazing system. If you 
can, get a hold of the solar transmittance and conductivity of your 
window and you should be able to use the detailed input.

Pedro.

I've had a little experience in complex envelope geometry, although I've
never used ArchiCAD or Ecodesigner. Generally speaking though, energy
modeling software can't use curved geometry. Any curved surface has to be
approximated using planar surfaces. Modeling software need this planar
geometry in it's internal algorithms, especially to calculate the radiative
heat transfer and shading.

The approach I have used, for Energyplus, is to manually mesh a curved
surface using many smaller triangular surfaces. There are likely ways to
automate the process if you have very complex and large geometry.

Cheers,

Marcus

I don't think a WindowMaterial:Shade will properly account for the film, I
would instead look into creating your window in the software WINDOW from
LBL. This software can model detailed layer-by-layer windows with frames and
full spectral data, which can then be exported into EnergyPlus.

http://windows.lbl.gov/software/window/window.html

Good luck and I hope you let us know your solution!

P.S. EnergyPlus talks about the SHGC or g-Value of windows, not shading
coefficients. You can convert between them.

Jeong, Marcus, et al

That does of course assume you can get the properties of the window film from the manufacturer, which for new films can be easier said than done. The other issue is that many providers of the product ( not necessarily the manufacturers here) provide information for the film having been tested applied to a clear float glass and sometimes even for entire units, so it can be sometimes difficult to get the actual performance data of the film.

Shading coefficient is a quick way of including shades, etc in some other programs still use rather than the way EnergyPlus takes everything back to first principles calculations. Could still be useful if you are looking at say "living wall" features for example without having to go into the complexity of using a "shading" block or surface with a scheduled transmissivity.

Paul

Hi!

Meshing geometry may be necessary, but will result to a complex model 
with a lot of potential for error. From what I understand, this may 
result in a huge number of polygons, as "spiral 3d shading" sounds a lot 
like smooth shapes possibly highly specular surfaces (which is why I was 
asking for details). Archicad can output meshes (I remember obj), but it 
would be important to check mesh quality.

It would be interesting to assess the need for such a model here, or 
whether the performance could be represented by a simple plane with 
transmissive properties according to the more complex shading. If 
surfaces are diffuse and view is blocked, maybe a flat, 
diffuse-transmissive material could replace the shading's complex 
geometry. If there is direct view through the shading, as long as the 
surfaces are not specular, the actual shape should not matter and a much 
simplified replacement according to thickness and angles related to the 
facade normal would probably be sufficient. If it is a curvy specular 
shading, it is going to be difficult!

Cheers, Lars.

The current LEED template includes an entry for ?% new construction.?

If the template is as nifty as I would like to believe, it could scale the percentage thresh-holds to allocate points based on a pro-rated basis.

Anyone validate this?

You use the existing building criteria for % and points in LEED if your existing portion is greater than  half of the whole project sq.ft. (existing + addition).

Yes, I agree that i should use the existing envelope for the existing conditions of the existing building and the ASHRAE Min for the new building.  But it comes down to whether EA Credit 1 follows the new building % or the existing building %.  it is a 2 point difference that could effect strategies for saving energy later in the design.

The baselines for the new portion (addition) are ASHRAE definitions.

This should help considerably in your overall energy efficiency gains.

It all comes down to % new vs. % existing, on how much you can gain.

I have a unique situation where the architect is taking an existing building and majorly renovating it (definition of major per LEED is HVAC, envelope and interior spaces) and then building an addition which is roughly the same size of the existing building, give or take a 1000 sqft.

Has anyone run into this before or have any insight that might help me explain which avenue to take to my boss?  I am currently thinking new building, but if it was existing then that helps me even more.

You are correct ? I just did a v2009 submission and the template did scale based on the percent renovated to addition.  I have 7 points with 23.6% energy cost savings with 72% new, 28% renovation.

The current LEED template includes an entry for ?% new construction.?

 

If the template is as nifty as I would like to believe, it could scale the percentage thresh-holds to allocate points based on a pro-rated basis.

 

Anyone validate this?

You use the existing building criteria for % and points in LEED if your existing portion is greater than  half of the whole project sq.ft. (existing + addition).

Yes, I agree that i should use the existing envelope for the existing conditions of the existing building and the ASHRAE Min for the new building.  But it comes down to whether EA Credit 1 follows the new building % or the existing building %.  it is a 2 point difference that could effect strategies for saving energy later in the design.

I agree with Lars here. Energy efficiency applies to the modeling process too.

You might want to start out with a sensitivity study just to establish what percentage of the total project energy, cooling & heating loads are coming from the fa?ade. If its relatively small, then it doesn't make sense to use a ton of resources modeling it exactly, and you might want to create an approximate equivalent - either by simplifying the geometry or by scheduling transmittance.

If it is actually a large percentage of your building load, then I would look a little bit more in depth as to how it might be modeled.

Hi!

Meshing geometry may be necessary, but will result to a complex model
with a lot of potential for error. From what I understand, this may
result in a huge number of polygons, as "spiral 3d shading" sounds a lot
like smooth shapes possibly highly specular surfaces (which is why I was
asking for details). Archicad can output meshes (I remember obj), but it
would be important to check mesh quality.

It would be interesting to assess the need for such a model here, or
whether the performance could be represented by a simple plane with
transmissive properties according to the more complex shading. If
surfaces are diffuse and view is blocked, maybe a flat,
diffuse-transmissive material could replace the shading's complex
geometry. If there is direct view through the shading, as long as the
surfaces are not specular, the actual shape should not matter and a much
simplified replacement according to thickness and angles related to the
facade normal would probably be sufficient. If it is a curvy specular
shading, it is going to be difficult!

Cheers, Lars.

Rob,
Its not a unique situation ? we run into this all the time. You should probably use LEED NC.

In the EAc1 template you can fill out percentages for new construction and for existing building (see below) and the calculation template prorates it.

Echoing others' advice using Einstein:  "A clever person solves a problem.  A wise person avoids it."  

 

A thought for "wisdom":  if you want to simplify the shading effect of an even helix, one might consider a helix looks identical from any angle along a horizontal plane - you might get a 'good enough' approximation at low sun angles using a simple 2D silhouette of the shape!

 

If you want to go the "accurate" route (now I'm trying to be clever... oh dear), I was intrigued by the challenge and after playing with the idea a bit in excel I can point you towards the math required to generate vertices for a helical shape... I think it's ultimately possible in eQuest, but it would be very hard.  Nothing I'd encourage/advocate in any sense... just sharing what I found for the curious.  I would much sooner seek a "reasonable approximation."

 

x(t) = r*cos (B*t)

y(t) = r*sin (B*t)

z(t) = t

 

where:

  coil height = period = 2pi/B  <-- set B = 2pi/(coil height)

  r = radius

  t = interval for points = angle between points, viewed from above (expressed in fractions of pi)

 

Those three functions along with the variables as described will return a helix in cartesian (xyz coordinates).  You could in theory generate a full set, then "offset" the original along the z-axis by the thickness of your actual "coil" to get the other half of the vertices.  Alternating between these sets, you could define a series of 2d planes which together would look pretty much like a coil spiraling as high as you'd want it to...  But you would undoubtedly save time by defining polygons for a height equal to a certain even number of periods, then copy/pasting the result as it would repeat for the resulting height.  I would definitely advise caution/consideration before setting the 't' variable to anything less than pi/6, lest you end up with magnitudes more polygons beyond reason. 

 

For your sake, I'm starting to hope you don't even read past the first few lines... haha!

I agree with Lars here. Energy efficiency applies to the modeling process too.

 

You might want to start out with a sensitivity study just to establish what percentage of the total project energy, cooling & heating loads are coming from the fa?ade. If its relatively small, then it doesn't make sense to use a ton of resources modeling it exactly, and you might want to create an approximate equivalent - either by simplifying the geometry or by scheduling transmittance.

 

If it is actually a large percentage of your building load, then I would look a little bit more in depth as to how it might be modeled.

Hi!

 

Meshing geometry may be necessary, but will result to a complex model

with a lot of potential for error. From what I understand, this may

result in a huge number of polygons, as "spiral 3d shading" sounds a lot

like smooth shapes possibly highly specular surfaces (which is why I was

asking for details). Archicad can output meshes (I remember obj), but it

would be important to check mesh quality.

 

It would be interesting to assess the need for such a model here, or

whether the performance could be represented by a simple plane with

transmissive properties according to the more complex shading. If

surfaces are diffuse and view is blocked, maybe a flat,

diffuse-transmissive material could replace the shading's complex

geometry. If there is direct view through the shading, as long as the

surfaces are not specular, the actual shape should not matter and a much

simplified replacement according to thickness and angles related to the

facade normal would probably be sufficient. If it is a curvy specular

shading, it is going to be difficult!

 

Cheers, Lars.

Dear all,

I often do  loads, and I have not had this question before. Now I have a
debate with my co-worker.
The LEED and ASHRAE 90.1 say that every solar exposure has to have a
separate control zone. I agree. But ...
I usually model a room with different exposures as one zone if it is
different from other rooms or attach this room  to a zone with the exposure
that has more influence ( if room has South and West walls, I attach to a
zone with similar usage rooms with south exposure). And my co-worker says
that LEED asks to submit a plan with properly modeled zones which have to
have their own control.
The question is
Do I have to assume 2 zones for a room with 2 different exposures or I still
can model as one zone with one control.

Thank you,

Evgenia,

The eQUEST Tutorial has a good discussion of zoning in it. Std 90 requires a
perimeter/core zoning pattern at least.

John is correct to point you to mechanical system zones, but there are times
that you won't need to put each and every zone in. An example of one of them
is a multi-family building with a number of units on each exposure. They can
be combined into a thermal block, as discussed in Table G3.1 of Standard 90.
When you use this type of zoning each corner unit is typically handled as a
separate zone since they have 2 exposures.

I hope that answers your question. Zoning is very important and can make or
break your model.

Best,

Carol

Hi Nikola,

In order to meet LEED EAp2 Minimum Energy Performance, the project must
comply with all mandatory provisions of ASHRAE 90.1-2007.  Section 5.4.2
Fenestration and Doors requires that fenestration performanc be determined
per section 5.8.2.  Section 5.8.2.5 Solar Heat Gain Coefficient requires
that the SHGC for the overall fenestration area (including framing) be
determined in accordance with NFRC 200.

If you read the exceptions, what you have done previously (use COG SHGC) is
an acceptable method per 5.8.2.5 exception b.  The method described in your
quote below is not acceptable unless you are provided with an NFRC
simulation or certified product number showing that the SHGC is 0.25 when
framing is accounted for per NFRC 200.

Message-ID: <7D963F3317DB07469F78F2CB71DE10632634886C8C@TOR-SVR-EX5.mcw.com>

Hello Sir/Madam,

I am modeling a building with eQuest 3-64 and I've gotten a Runtime error message that says,

"This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way. Please contact the application's support team for more information".

After I click OK the whole program shuts down without saving. The same problem occurred after I rebooted the computer and again on a different computer with 3-64.

To provide you a bit more background I'll explain what I was doing:

A building footprint in the Building Development Wizard needed to be changed (because of the wrong scale) so I deleted the footprint and imported a new CAD file to the proper scale. This worked fine for the first shell.
For the second shell, when I try to import a new CAD file, a portion of the screen in the background turns black, I select the specific drawing I want from the dialogue box and when I click Open the entire background turns black. After a few minutes of an hourglass cursor, the Runtime Error message appears.

Attached is a screenshot of the error message and the black screen.

Please provide any help that you can to help fix this problem so I can continue modeling the building.


Thank you for your time and assistance,

Alex Leonard

Yes, lots of framing results in a system SHGC lower than the COG SHGC.  I
know Kawneer does publish their data, although it is per AAMA 507, which is
a testing standard similar to NFRC 200, which is what 90.1 requires. See
page 34 of
http://www.kawneer.com/kawneer/north_america/catalog/pdf/1600_Wall_Sys1__E--
A.pdf for an example.

 

I have submitted a LEED project using the manufacturer's info, but it is
currently under review, so I cannot give you a good answer.  I would hope
that as long as you have the manufacturer's published info per NFRC 200 you
would be okay.

Hey,
 
I know there was a discussion on this a few months back but one 
area which the discussion did not cover was regarding the time it takes 
for energy model simulations. I am currently working on my first LEED 
project which is a complex university lab building. I am using IES VE to
 model the building. After a long process I am finally nearing project 
completion. However, I found myself spending a huge amount of time 
waiting during simulations. Using a computer with the spec recommended 
by IES VE for large projects, the full PRM simulation took approximately
 30 hours (6 hours for each - proposed, baseline 0, baseline 90, 
baseline 180 and baseline 270). As my bosses are looking to me for ideas
 regarding cost for future projects, does one account for simulation 
time in the price or how is this done?
 
Any help is greatly appreciated!
 
Kind Regards,
 
Donal

Try to run models like that at night before you leave.



Most likely you?ll see some savings in run-time (whichever program you use)
by reducing the number of objects in your next project where you see the
opportunity to combine things in a reasonable manner.



I wouldn?t normally include any significant time allocation for simulation
time as you describe, but if you are going to incur it I guess you better
let your boss know to account for that.  Hopefully you can find something
else to work on ahead of time while the calculation proceeds if your next
project has similarly long run times.

Hey,



I know there was a discussion on this a few months back but one area which
the discussion did not cover was regarding the time it takes for energy
model simulations. I am currently working on my first LEED project which is
a complex university lab building. I am using IES VE to model the building.
After a long process I am finally nearing project completion. However, I
found myself spending a huge amount of time waiting during simulations.
Using a computer with the spec recommended by IES VE for large projects, the
full PRM simulation took approximately 30 hours (6 hours for each -
proposed, baseline 0, baseline 90, baseline 180 and baseline 270). As my
bosses are looking to me for ideas regarding cost for future projects, does
one account for simulation time in the price or how is this done?



Any help is greatly appreciated!



Kind Regards,



Donal

Set it up during the day and leave it running over night and have a minimum of 2 machines, so when its tied up running simulations you can still get on with other stuff.

Depending on number of zones that sounds pretty reasonable to me. I've had energyplus models I got bored with letting them run after 4 days. Ok its quicker now, but the Apache bit of IES is always a bit quicker than most. The issue comes when you start to take account of the Outcast and Radiance calculations for daylight linking control, all of which energyplus does at the same time as running simulations.

You should obviously take the time into account if you are setting up model, etc but I'd be very surprised if you can get away with charging for computational time. CFD people can get away with that as they are tying up processors for long periods often right across a network and it often does take longer.

Just my own opinion of course, but I'd be surprised if anyone on this list gets away with that. If you do, please don't tell me, just well done to you...;-)

My two cents?..

If it takes 6 hours, you?ve probably got too much detail in the model, e.g. too many zones, too many surfaces, shading elements that do little, too many individual windows when they could be combined, etc.

There are exceptions, of course, , but I think there are few models which NEED a very high level of detail.

You might ask one of the IES support folk their opinion of your model and for recommendations to make it run faster.

I second James. Also one place where run time does really affect you
is in trouble shooting a model. If you are running new system types or
a complex control and need to do a number of test runs to get
everything operating properly, having a simulation program that takes
lots of time can be difficult (even when running only a partial year
simulation)

Subject: [Bldg-sim] water-source heat pumps and VAV ERU with DCV
Message-ID: <001001cc4562$9c295dd0$d47c1970$@net>

I am a modeling a school (new construction) with water-source heat pumps,
demand-controlled ventilation, and a rooftop energy recovery unit with
separate ductwork and VAV boxes that supplies 100% of the outside air. 

 

Is there any way to accurately model this in eQUEST v3.64, or must I find a
work-around? My review of the archives didn't turn up very much except more
people with the same problem.

 

Thank you in advance,

Recently, I've had an odd string of personal contacts and strangers
alike confiding with me and demonstrating their frustrations over energy
model reviews.  As an outside-party, it's actually largely entertaining
to hear, and puts a few things in perspective.  We are all human, and we
all share common emotions when put under the spotlight, but how we put
those feelings to action makes all the difference between an
easy/productive review process and a train wreck...

 

I've had the pleasure of treading both paths, and I thought it might be
helpful for modelers of all skill/experience levels to share a few tips
I've developed to manage the stress-level in your energy model reviews.
A few reviewers out there might also benefit to turn this advice around
and apply it to their practices as well:

 

1.       Do not assume your reviewer knows less than you.  

a.       Recognize that stuff gets lost in translation - energy modeling
minutiae are rarely easy to communicate in text format.

b.      It's human to feel annoyed when your work is questioned, but
practice patience.  Odds are you and/or your reviewer are going to learn
something as a result. 

c.       If you ever catch yourself thinking/responding in a dismissive
or condescending fashion, stop.  Your heart is in the wrong place
(however right you might be) and you're missing the point of an
objective review.  Take a breather!

2.       Do not assume your reviewer knows more than you, either.  

a.       Do not be afraid to challenge or question a query, but prepare
and present a solid case for any contrary position.  

b.      It is very easy to run yourself in circles trying to
explain/justify yourself when it isn't really necessary.  

c.       Reviewers can and should make it plain when an in-depth
explanation is required.

3.       Be prepared to change your mind!  For better or for worse,
reviews are ultimately beneficial to all parties involved, because they
provide an excellent opportunity to learn a thing or two.  Allow your
personal expertise to continually evolve and incorporate, or at least
recognize, others' perspectives and practices.  They may serve you well
personally in the future!

4.       Once in a while, you may have to work with an individual who is
truly stubborn, unreasonable and is not willing to participate in any
objective discussion.  If a review should fail to "close out" over such
behavior, the best you can hope for is to document communications so you
can later make apparent in hindsight that you were proactive, and
pulling your weight to move the process forward.  

 

If anyone has similar guiding principles or tips to share (from either
side of the reviewing fence), I think it would be much appreciated =)!

Regarding item #4 (stubborn, unreasonable reviewer), when I am responding
to an item that I absolutely do not agree with the reviewer's
interpretation, I usually take the following approach:

 

1)      Lay out my full argument as respectfully as possible. Usually this
involves screen shots of the specific code and/or ASHRAE 90.1 sections
that I believe bolsters my argument. 

2)      Present the results that I believe accurately reflect the
requirements of the modeling protocol.

3)      Put in a qualifying statement along the lines of "However, if the
reviewer does not believe this is the correct interpretation of this
ASHRAE 90.1 requirement."

4)      Present the results that reflect the approach that the reviewer
suggested or was clearly implying. 

 

This way the ball is in their court to make the final call, and they have
the full information necessary to decide how many "points" (assuming LEED
compliance is the goal) to award for the project. They don't have to try
to approximate how much savings is realistic if they disagree with my
interpretation, and my client has the most flexibility in deciding if they
want to accept how the reviewer has ruled, or if it is worth trying to
appeal. 

 

It doesn't do any good to paint yourself into a corner where the reviewer
might still disagree with your modeling methodology, but you have already
used your one shot at responding to comments.

Excellent comments!

Nick's point #1 (reviewer may be smarter than you) is one that is
particularly hard for many engineers to swallow.  I won't tell you how many
times I've started a meeting or discussion thinking I was the "brightest
penny in the bucket", only to find out that others had much better insights
than I.  I'm more humble now than 30 years ago.

Point #2 is almost as important (reviewer may not be smarter than you).
Each of us travels somewhat similar paths if we're in the same industry, but
it's a very large industry and our reviewer almost certainly has not had the
same experiences.  Give him (her) the same patience that we'd like to
receive ourselves!

My problem isn't generally with the reviewer, it's with the LEED review
process.  Not being able to call the reviewers up and discuss comments
over the phone is a ridiculous waste of everyone's time.  Additionally, a
real review would involve looking at the model, not just a random
selection of I/O.  

 

I usually propose that clients go "beyond LEED" at this point, to save a
considerable amount of money that can be used to pay for additional EEMs
and because the documentation and process is so onerous.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Collecting Weather for Model Calibration
Message-ID: <assp.0180434757.47813BD5DFF1D147997345A40A193432038569FD@GREEN.southface.org>

I am about to put together a weather station to collect site specific
weather data to compare modeled vs. measured performance of a house
museum which relies on natural ventilation during cooling season and a
radiant floor for heating.  I've found a couple of papers on weather
input required for epw and tmy formats ( the modeling will be done in
Energy Plus and eQuest), including this 
http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/pdfs/weatherdatainform
ation.pdf and a paper from Texas A&M, 
http://repository.tamu.edu/bitstream/handle/1969.1/94836/ESL-TR-95-12-03
.pdf?sequence=1 which cover the data sets read by the weather file. 

 

I was planning on installing monitors for temp (DB), humidity, wind
speed and direction and  global horizontal solar radiation. Is this
sufficient to get a useable set of weather data for model calibration
and what resources are available to assist in transferring the collected
data into weather file format?

Also, If anyone wants to go in on a weather station in the north Georgia
mountains let me know.

 

Thanks in advance.

Hi

Can some one please tell if more than 100 parametrics are allowed in
EnergyPlus? I am doing a research and need to run around 400-500
paramterics. Can I put all of them in one single file using IDF text editor.

Message-ID: <6770429BC4498B45B627F96AF8FC04741C1C7819B4@helene>

I needed some information on any existing simulation tools available to simulate air-water, ground-water heat pumps and biomass boilers while doing energy modelling for housing. Is there any tool that does system sizing as well. For example for a house of 50 kW/m2 heat loss what capacity of heat pump would be required to heat the house to  comfort temperatures?
I am doing projects of energy modelling of existing housing and need to assess heat pumps as an alternative heating system. What size of heat pump will I require and what energy savings would I achieve compared conventional oil or  LPG? Is there any tool that answers this?

Hi John,

I think this is how to do it: If you know the what the film is, I think you can create the new glass+film combo in LBNL's OPTICS. You can then import that new glass/film into LBNL's WINDOW. You should finally be able to make a DOE report file in WINDOW and import in eQUEST.

Message-ID: <FCEBC0C28321F7479789B25A13030F6903E1F52E@sandbinc2.sbi.smithboucher.com>

I have a precedent question for everyone... this is not a "how to"
procedural question for any particular software, but to simply feel out
what has worked for others in the past:

 

Here's a quick description of the situation at-hand:  a VAV terminal
unit with a "normal" minimum damper position (say, 30%) is tied by relay
to the space occupancy sensor, which also controls the lights.  Upon
sensing space vacancy, the minimum airflow damper position is reset to
0% (airflow is permitted to stop, provided thermostat temperature set
point is satisfied).  Upon sensing occupancy, the preset minimum damper
position is restored.

 

For LEED/USGBC-reviewed energy models, can anyone relate success in
modeling this or a similar energy-saving behavior in the proposed model,
distinct from the baseline?  If so, what approach did you use to model
this behavior and/or quantify the energy savings? 

 

I was discussing the possibilities with some colleagues and have a few
ideas for approaches that might all be justifiable, ranging from simple
(and quick) to complex (and time-consuming).  

 

There are likely multiple "right" answers here, but I am hoping to
identify some precedent to understand what we can anticipate the LEED
reviewership will accept.  

 

Thanks in advance!

Message-ID: <D0AEAD83419A1848820FD3EDF46C99B501179B127B@AEI-MB.aeieng.lan>

All,

The Trane Trace energy cost budget report shows no cooling energy, despite having a cooling plant modeled.  Also, the yearly energy cost reported is zero, despite having a reported yearly electricity usage.  Is there a bug in the program?.  Has anyone experience this?  

A little background on the plants being modeled.  The cooling plant is modeled as 10 water source heat pumps piped in parallel along with a district cooling plant under the cooling plants tab.  The primary purpose of the heat pumps is to provide heating while the district cooling plant provides cooling to the building.  The heat pumps take chilled water return from the campus loop and reject the heat to the building, while returning chilled water back to the campus loop.  

Thanks,

Thomas

Nick,

I would do it with schedules.  This would be the long method.

I have the same controls and have not got around to model it.  I would also
make many schedules.  A different schedule for occupancy, lights, equipment,
ect.  Also if this applies to a lot of rooms, you'd likely make multiple
schedules, one assuming that the room is empty from 9~10 another room empty
from 2~3.  (The inverse for meeting rooms, if you have multiple meeting
rooms, not all meetings will happen at the same time.)

I agree with John, I've done this on a model before and its painful.  Assuming there are 10 hours in a work day, I set up 10 different occupancy and lighting schedules, each schedule being essentially identical except for a different hour of zero occupancy / lighting.  I then applied these 10 schedules to the different office zones on a floor so that specific areas were vacant from 8am-9am, some vacant from 9am-10am, etc.  And then for my system, I assumed relatively consistent 10% non-occupied conditions and reduced the OA at the system level accordingly.  If your non-occupied conditions are more drastic (30%), obviously you can set up your schedules differently.

However, if your primary air is also cooling (and not some sort of DOAS chilled water VAV box), then you are going to also have to specify 10 separate thermostat schedules (really 20 with heating and cooling) so that the rooms do not have unmet load hours.  I'm assuming you go into setback mode when the offices are unoccupied.

However, this was under v2.0, so that was a long time ago and reviewers were not as critical in their reviews.

Thanks so much for the suggestions!

 

I myself have tread the "extensive, realistic fractional/thermostat
scheduling" path before under similar circumstances.  Upon facing a VERY
large project, where the amount of explicit scheduling required for that
approach is compounded by the sheer quantity and variety of occupied
spaces benefiting from this relay setup, I am challenged with
brainstorming any acceptable (by LEED reviewer) means of approximating
the same behavior/savings by simplifying the problem...

 

Here are some alternative ideas we've come up with so far  - I would
very much appreciate others' thoughts on these, or any further related
LEED/USGBC experiences to share as well:

1.       90.1 already prescribes how we quantify the savings of
occupancy sensors for installed lighting  (10 or 15% flat deduction on
the LPD).  Rather than define & justify the quantity and timing of
unoccupied hours between varying space types (murky waters at best), one
could instead reduce the loads incident on the affected systems by the
same percentage.  This might be accomplished by applying this 10/15%
deduction to the affected spaces' fractional load schedules (occupancy,
equipment & lighting).  One would need to tread carefully to avoid
"double-dipping" on any spaces already claiming a LPD deduction for
occupancy sensors.  Baseline model's schedules would remain unaffected
and would be documented alongside the modified ones to illustrate the
difference. 

2.       (Simpler to model, but requiring slightly more documentation):
Let's say a hospital has an annual average of 85% occupancy for all its
patient rooms.  Treating every other room normally, select a
representative sampling (considering envelope loads) of 15% of the
patient rooms.  Model those selected rooms as "empty" (set people,
lights and equipment loads = 0) but still conditioned to maintain the
thermostat setpoint (against loads incident from the envelope &
neighboring spaces). Apply the 0% minimum turndown behavior to those
"empty" rooms only.  Baseline model would receive identical treatments,
excepting the 0% turndown behavior.  Documentation would include
illustrating which zones were sampled against the others, and
justification for the net annual "occupancy rate" used for each space
type.

 

I have mixed feelings - obviously any simplification of the problem has
the potential to under/overstate the savings that might be found with a
more exhaustive scheduling approach, but may result in as good or even a
better estimation provided with solid documentation and execution.  Does
anyone think the above approaches could work well, or have any
suggestions to refine the strategies?  

 

Thanks again!

 

~Nick

I agree with John, I've done this on a model before and its painful.
Assuming there are 10 hours in a work day, I set up 10 different
occupancy and lighting schedules, each schedule being essentially
identical except for a different hour of zero occupancy / lighting.  I
then applied these 10 schedules to the different office zones on a floor
so that specific areas were vacant from 8am-9am, some vacant from
9am-10am, etc.  And then for my system, I assumed relatively consistent
10% non-occupied conditions and reduced the OA at the system level
accordingly.  If your non-occupied conditions are more drastic (30%),
obviously you can set up your schedules differently.

 

However, if your primary air is also cooling (and not some sort of DOAS
chilled water VAV box), then you are going to also have to specify 10
separate thermostat schedules (really 20 with heating and cooling) so
that the rooms do not have unmet load hours.  I'm assuming you go into
setback mode when the offices are unoccupied.

 

However, this was under v2.0, so that was a long time ago and reviewers
were not as critical in their reviews.

Nick,

 

I would do it with schedules.  This would be the long method.

 

I have the same controls and have not got around to model it.  I would
also

make many schedules.  A different schedule for occupancy, lights,
equipment,

ect.  Also if this applies to a lot of rooms, you'd likely make multiple

schedules, one assuming that the room is empty from 9~10 another room
empty

from 2~3.  (The inverse for meeting rooms, if you have multiple meeting

rooms, not all meetings will happen at the same time.)

I have a precedent question for everyone... this is not a "how to"
procedural

question for any particular software, but to simply feel out what has
worked

for others in the past:

 

 

 

Here's a quick description of the situation at-hand:  a VAV terminal
unit

with a "normal" minimum damper position (say, 30%) is tied by relay to
the

space occupancy sensor, which also controls the lights.  Upon sensing
space

vacancy, the minimum airflow damper position is reset to 0% (airflow is

permitted to stop, provided thermostat temperature set point is
satisfied).

Upon sensing occupancy, the preset minimum damper position is restored.

 

 

 

For LEED/USGBC-reviewed energy models, can anyone relate success in
modeling

this or a similar energy-saving behavior in the proposed model, distinct
from

the baseline?  If so, what approach did you use to model this behavior
and/or

quantify the energy savings? 

 

 

 

I was discussing the possibilities with some colleagues and have a few
ideas

for approaches that might all be justifiable, ranging from simple (and
quick)

to complex (and time-consuming).  

 

 

 

There are likely multiple "right" answers here, but I am hoping to
identify

some precedent to understand what we can anticipate the LEED
reviewership

will accept.  

 

 

 

Thanks in advance!

Hi Nick,
 
To keep it simple, I would just derate the schedules, your 10/15% reduction
but on an hourly basis (ie one or more hours are moved to 0%/setback) and
apply the RESET-PRIORITY and MIN-RESET-FLOW keywords.  I think averaging it
out beforehand and explaining as part of your modelling methodology in your
report would take less time and be easier to explain.  I would start with a
small test model, to make sure you have the right percentages.

I also agree with using schedules. I think the fact that Std 90 went from
"no schedule changes" to allowing it for DCV means they do too.

I think the best thing you can do to simplify your LEED review is to explain
to the reviewer what you are doing and why. As long as they can follow you,
it makes sense, and it is reasonably conservative, i.e. err on that side, it
should be acceptable to them.

Yes you can do more than 100 parameterics in EnergyPlus. If 
you use just a text editor than just add more parametrics to 
the IDF file and it should work. If you use IDF Editor, you 
can add additional fields in the Energy+.IDD file for the 
parametric objects. Add as many fields as you need by 
copying the last field and changing the numbering as 
appropriate.

The simple answer would be to double check that your economics are entered
properly.  Also, did you have it scan for errors?

I have had files become corrupt with Trace and do crazy things like this
(that's why I archive at least daily and save all the old archives so I can
recover is something happens.)  Usually CDS can repair the file, so you may
just want to call them because they'll have more suggestions.  Also,
sometimes if you get an error right after it calculates weird things will
happen to the reports and you need to re-run the calculation.

You may also want to post to trace-users at lists.onebuilding.org and
http://energy-models.com/forum/energy-modeling-software/trace-700 - they're
ever-so-slightly more active for Trace questions.

All,

The Trane Trace energy cost budget report shows no cooling energy, despite
having a cooling plant modeled.  Also, the yearly energy cost reported is
zero, despite having a reported yearly electricity usage.  Is there a bug in
the program?.  Has anyone experience this?  

A little background on the plants being modeled.  The cooling plant is
modeled as 10 water source heat pumps piped in parallel along with a
district cooling plant under the cooling plants tab.  The primary purpose of
the heat pumps is to provide heating while the district cooling plant
provides cooling to the building.  The heat pumps take chilled water return
from the campus loop and reject the heat to the building, while returning
chilled water back to the campus loop.  

Thanks,

Thomas

John et al -

Agree Alex has a good procedure for picking up the angular dependence.

As a "quick-and-dirty" approach, you might be able to get an "effective" SHGC chart from the film manufacturer and use it with simplified window entry.

Attached is a similar chart I've used before from Vista Window Film.

Hi John,

I think this is how to do it: If you know the what the film is, I think you can create the new glass+film combo in LBNL's OPTICS. You can then import that new glass/film into LBNL's WINDOW. You should finally be able to make a DOE report file in WINDOW and import in eQUEST.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] eQuest Modeling of Film on top of Glass

Okay, Smart peoples:

I have an existing glass (say Solar Bronze) which has properties of SHGC, VT, and U-Value. I now wish to take this same glass and add a film on top of it to further enhance the SHGC and VT properties.

I cannot just take a diferent window from the Glass Library, because I do not know the additive SHGC and VT effects.  Is there any way to do a "glass-layers" operation? Or must I just guess at a glass that MIGHT be the equivalent?

Thanks.

Message-ID: <CABo60smzfhdchuoiPsL9W+jHEqYidNcD0oPSq18d-VBT80gd0w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

I have come across the PVVT modeling approach as a workaround for simulating
VRV/VRF Systems in eQuest.

I was wondering why the workaround of using Water-source Heat Pumps to mimic
a VRV/VRF system has not been proposed as yet.

Any explanation/reasoning would be much appreciated.

Thank you.

Simulating the VRV/VRF as a WSHP is effectively what the PVVT approach is modeling; it uses a heat pump as the heating source and can be set to water cooled. The PVVT allows for more complexity and control in how the water source heat pump operates. (i.e. variable speed compressor) See the attached presentation put together by Dana Troy and Mark Denyer, it?s quite helpful in their explanation.

Hello All,

 

I have come across the PVVT modeling approach as a workaround for simulating VRV/VRF Systems in eQuest.

 

I was wondering why the workaround of using Water-source Heat Pumps to mimic a VRV/VRF system has not been proposed as yet. 

 

Any explanation/reasoning would be much appreciated.

 

Thank you.

Good Morning Sim Board,

I am working on a project where I am simulating a Desiccant Unit that is controlled off of a space humidity sensor.  I began with the example file DesiccantCVRhZoneRHCtrl.idf from the support documentation with the current E+ install.  Unfortunately the AIRLOOP associated with this example file is not quite the configuration I am looking for.  My attempts at re-authoring my Airloop have proven arduous at best.  I was hoping you folks could steer me towards some alternative example files.  The specific AIRLOOP arrangement I am looking for follows this path:

OA Mixing Box > Gas Fired Desiccant Wheel > Supply Fan > Chilled Water Coiling Coil > Hot Water Heating Coil

Thank you,
Josh

Dear Akshay,

Did you mean 400-500 parameters or parametric jobs? Either way you can
try jeplus. It can handle half a million parametric jobs, which is only
limited by your computer's memory size. If you have a lot of parameters,
jeplus' project file and idf editor will help you keep track of them.

Cheers,

Yi

Yes you can do more than 100 parameterics in EnergyPlus. If 
you use just a text editor than just add more parametrics to 
the IDF file and it should work. If you use IDF Editor, you 
can add additional fields in the Energy+.IDD file for the 
parametric objects. Add as many fields as you need by 
copying the last field and changing the numbering as 
appropriate.

Message-ID: <4A015401026CF44ABCC4D2A6A467AA1801752F69@EXCHANGE1.cadd_group.ghtltd.com>

I was curious if anyone knew whether the following is allowed in
accordance with Appendix G (and/or LEED):

 

If have a hotel where the baseline system is PTAC, and those units are
intended to be the source of ventilation air, I have to have the fans
run continuously per Appendix G.

 

If my proposed building has a central OA delivery system that introduces
OA directly to each room, can I have that system run continuously and
allow my FCUs in each hotel room to run intermittently?

 

Thanks for any advice!

As long as you're delivering the same quantity of outside air in both models
on an hourly basis, and accounting for how the proposed system will actually
operate, I'd say yes.  If for any reason your ventilation air operates
intermittently in the proposed design, you would need to schedule it the
same way in the baseline.

Dear Josh,

As a start, "as-built" should really be "as-measured" by you or a reliable
tech.

The "measured" values should include:

.         Power for all major equipment

.         Flow for all major fans and pumps

.         Zone and discharge air temp setpoints

.         Schedules of (real) operation (If you have a BMS which trends
operation, that's a good place to start.  If not, plan to talk to
knowledgeable people)

.         Actual weather (you might check out www.weatheranalytics.com) 

.         There will still be unknowns / unknowables, such as infiltration.
Those can be adjusted within reasonable limits for a better fit.

.         Start by narrowing down the list of variables that are not know
with certainty and do NOT assume that things are as shown on plans!

 

p.s., I've worked up an interface between GenOpt (Dr. Michael Wetter at
LBNL) and E+ which makes iterative runs of E+ until it has a "Best fit".
It's still in the "development" stage, but seems to work well.  Please send
a private message if you're interested in trying it out.

Hi James,

I've come across the similar senario recently. I guess the answer will be
yes and you will be able to save fan energy provided central AHU fans are
efficient.

What?s the level of calibration required?



I?d like to refer you to a paper by Dr. Z. O?Neil from the UTRC about
sensitivity analysis in an EnergyPlus model which might help you focus your
efforts on what to investigate.  This was given at the recent ASHRAE
conference in Montreal on Wednesday morning.



If the requested level of calibration is very high, then you?ll be looking
at a LOT of things?not just from deviations from model subroutine
accuracies, but due to occupancy and use related variances, as well as
developing your model of the control system.



I?d be very surprised if your main obstsacle is accuracy of a model
subroutine compared to ability of the users to provide data and the ability
to capture the actual control system logic.  (Or reflect user
changes/overrides, etc.)

Good Morning Sim Board,



The project I am working on requires a level of calibration between my
AS-BUILT simulations and metered data for the facility.  Would anyone please
be able to comment on their previous calibration experiences?  Does E+ tend
to simulate certain loads under or over for instance? Do systems/components
tend to run true to their real life equivalents, or are similar deviations
common?



Thank you,

Josh

I will say I got really excited this past year about the isolated idea
of combining snow melt with geothermal well field design...

For those unfamiliar, well fields in this part of the Midwest (KS/MO/NE)
historically heat up over the long haul, especially with intense
equipment loading like John's situation...  fields installed decades ago
commonly end up struggling and failing when the extreme summers roll
around, sooner or later. 

The most common pre-emptive/patch solution I've seen to tackle this
trend is to tack on (or set up infrastructure for) an exterior dry
cooler to reject excess heat from the loop. 

I pushed hard recently to consider a "snow melt" loop (even if not used
to functionally melt snow) as a better "free" means of keeping a
well-field in balance annually, but the real trick is in how to set it
up so that this extra loop it doesn't require active
maintenance/monitoring... Making a location for horizontal loops like
this is also a challenge in many cases where the land is not readily
available or has future expansions planned.  Most clients out there,
even those with motivated maintenance staffing, would really be best
served with a "fire and forget" system that could handle itself decades
down the road without requiring active monitoring/adjusting as the
seasons change and temps swing. Ultimately, I haven't yet come up with
any particularly great setup that I would consider fool-proof over the
span of decades, but I'd be very interested if others have
thoughts/details to share on how this might be achieved.

Conceivably, and to your specific questions John, I'd speculate the
actual controls would at a minimum need to define parameters
establishing a range of "target" loop temperatures for the cooling and
heating season (these would be based on 1st year loop simulations, to
start).  The "melt" loop routed near the surface (or embedded in
concrete where it might be safe), would be normally closed, but valves
would open for circulation when the outside temperatures* are conducive
to pushing the well field return temperatures in the desired direction.
Done cleverly, you could push the system to permit water below the
setpoint during the cooling season, and above the setpoint during the
heating season as well (this behavior would potentially occur in the
swing seasons - spring/fall).  I'm thinking the ideal controls would
constantly monitor and take advantage of free heat rejection & free heat
gains whenever applicable.

* Another point to consider:  What temperatures are ideal to monitor for
such a loop?  Outside air data may be easily available, but considering
the lag in topsoil temps and depending on what you choose for the actual
loop installation location you might do better to locate a sensor
elsewhere... A loop underneath black asphalt getting will experience
different temperatures than the same loop embedded in light-colored
hardscape or simply under exposed topsoil.

Northern climates might find the same setup of interest to primarily
gain free heat gain to keep loops in balance, routing the secondary loop
through building envelopes or similar massed structures that would pick
up extra heat in the summer months.

Suffice to say I find it an interesting topic - if anyone has ever come
across a design guide or white paper on this subject I'd also be very
interested to hear about it!

Check the Oklahoma State Building and Environmental Thermal Systems
Research Group -- there are a number of papers on various topics related
to geothermal systems in hybrid, shallow, and other configurations.

http://www.hvac.okstate.edu/

There is also a great research project where snow melt was the primary
purpose of the geothermal system, which is not quite what you guys are
after but might offer some guidance.

I was wondering how the snow melt system would work help you during the
summer months, unless you are up in the mountains somewhere. What about
preheating, or just heating, DHW as it would be a year round load?

Hey Carol,

 

In a majority of 4-season climates (here in Kansas City too), I'd expect
you would not use such a secondary loop in the dead of summer where
night-time temperatures would not drop to practical/conducive levels for
heat rejection.

 

But to answer your question from other angles: this heat rejection/heat
gain loop would help in the summer months decades down the road, where
you've avoided overcooling/overheating the ground temperatures over
time.  

 

It would also help in that through late spring and early summer, you
would be able to cool through the workday/evening, then use cooler
nighttime/morning temperatures to offload the extra heat built up on a
daily basis, resulting in cooler net temperatures day-to-day.  This
would ultimately reduce and forestall the maximum temperatures that
would be reached during mid-to-late summer when you'd want this transfer
loop shut off 24/7.

 

I'll be digging into that OSU link David, thanks for the heads up!

 

~Nick

I will say I got really excited this past year about the isolated idea
of combining snow melt with geothermal well field design...

For those unfamiliar, well fields in this part of the Midwest (KS/MO/NE)
historically heat up over the long haul, especially with intense
equipment loading like John's situation...  fields installed decades ago
commonly end up struggling and failing when the extreme summers roll
around, sooner or later.

The most common pre-emptive/patch solution I've seen to tackle this
trend is to tack on (or set up infrastructure for) an exterior dry
cooler to reject excess heat from the loop.

I pushed hard recently to consider a "snow melt" loop (even if not used
to functionally melt snow) as a better "free" means of keeping a
well-field in balance annually, but the real trick is in how to set it
up so that this extra loop it doesn't require active
maintenance/monitoring... Making a location for horizontal loops like
this is also a challenge in many cases where the land is not readily
available or has future expansions planned.  Most clients out there,
even those with motivated maintenance staffing, would really be best
served with a "fire and forget" system that could handle itself decades
down the road without requiring active monitoring/adjusting as the
seasons change and temps swing. Ultimately, I haven't yet come up with
any particularly great setup that I would consider fool-proof over the
span of decades, but I'd be very interested if others have
thoughts/details to share on how this might be achieved.

Conceivably, and to your specific questions John, I'd speculate the
actual controls would at a minimum need to define parameters
establishing a range of "target" loop temperatures for the cooling and
heating season (these would be based on 1st year loop simulations, to
start).  The "melt" loop routed near the surface (or embedded in
concrete where it might be safe), would be normally closed, but valves
would open for circulation when the outside temperatures* are conducive
to pushing the well field return temperatures in the desired direction.
Done cleverly, you could push the system to permit water below the
setpoint during the cooling season, and above the setpoint during the
heating season as well (this behavior would potentially occur in the
swing seasons - spring/fall).  I'm thinking the ideal controls would
constantly monitor and take advantage of free heat rejection & free heat
gains whenever applicable.

* Another point to consider:  What temperatures are ideal to monitor for
such a loop?  Outside air data may be easily available, but considering
the lag in topsoil temps and depending on what you choose for the actual
loop installation location you might do better to locate a sensor
elsewhere... A loop underneath black asphalt getting will experience
different temperatures than the same loop embedded in light-colored
hardscape or simply under exposed topsoil.

Northern climates might find the same setup of interest to primarily
gain free heat gain to keep loops in balance, routing the secondary loop
through building envelopes or similar massed structures that would pick
up extra heat in the summer months.

Suffice to say I find it an interesting topic - if anyone has ever come
across a design guide or white paper on this subject I'd also be very

John,

 

While I appreciate the relative novelty of a snow melt system for balancing annual ground loop temperatures, there are a couple ideas that shouldn't be excluded outright when considering server cooling loads: higher cooling temperatures and air-side economizers. The control strategies and equipment for economizers are well-established, and their use is becoming more common in datacenters despite concerns about contaminants and humidity control. A conservative supply air temperature is 75?F, with ASHRAE TC 9.9 recommendation as high as 80.6?F. Google, Intel and Microsoft have all had good experimental results even with 90?F and above, and with little to no humidity control. I also second Carol's suggestion of heat pump space heating and DHW.

 

The servers might have a different opinion:

Subject: [Bldg-sim] modeling a VRV/VRF system for design stage iterations
Message-ID: <CAJaiD7pxsU6HM-jJ4NqgONp_aR67Sr07UMbNch0zwG2whx2dzw@mail.gmail.com>

All,

I'm looking for advice on the best way to account for a variable refrigerant
(VRV/VRF) systems for Design Development stage iterative runs on an
architectural project. Preferably in eQUEST but open to exploring other
software options including IESVE.

The exceptional calculation method with workarounds seems geared towards
detailed models during say LEED EA Cr1. Is there a quicker but somewhat
accurate way for design (architectural not mechanical) models?

Thank you,
Ramana.

Dear Forum,

(Excuse cross-posting!)

I'm now modeling a hotel which is seeking LEED certification.  The
"Executive summary" goes like this:

* Lower Level and 1st floor are ~25,000 square feet and contain meeting
rooms, offices, and Lobby.

* Floors 2-12 are guest rooms.

* The building is all-electric, so I'll use Baseline System #2 for guest
rooms and #4 for the remainder.

* The pre-renovation structure was ~80% windows in Climate Zone 2A.

* Post-renovation, the guest rooms floors will be ~45% glass and the
remainder will be ~50% windows.

 

The part I'm uncertain about is how to model the walls and windows. ASHRAE
90.1 Table G3.1, item 5f says 

"f. Existing Buildings. For existing building envelopes, the baseline
building design shall reflect existing conditions prior to any revisions
that are part of the scope of work being evaluated."

That seems to say that the 80% windows becomes the baseline envelope
definition....

On the other hand, the new design will certainly save a LOT of energy!

 

Please let me know your thoughts about:

a) whether the Baseline walls and windows should be modeled "as original"
for their "U" value, SHGF and ....

b) whether the normal 40% maximum glazing applies to an existing building
renovation for either the Baseline or Proposed design.

 

Thanks in advance!

I know I'm not the first one to walk this path, but it's the first time I
have walked it!

   When modeling an existing building as the baseline building under
   ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G you place the fenestration as found (area) and
   original u-values for the envelope including fenestration.

Message-ID: <912C14F60976CE428135CE5A102DA3C2BE688E355F@SBS.ecw.local>

John -
Seems that the basic goal is to balance both the 1) peak and 2) annual loading on your system more, by finding more heat sinks in both of those timeframes. I think DHW is a great suggestion, as is any measure that lowers your cooling load (economizer, data center efficiency measures, ice storage, higher heat pump efficiency). Adding heating would be the opposite approach - is there any building or process nearby that could benefit from some free heat (multifamily is perfect...)? Beyond that, yes you could consider any type of hybrid geothermal... There are of course many options for supplemental heat rejection, and snow melt is just one of them. If you stick with a hybrid with snow melt as the supplemental device, the thesis by Ramamoorthy (http://www.hvac.okstate.edu/research/Documents/Ramamoorthy_Thesis.pdf ) covers design and control of that particular configuration. And also, if you have access, there was a great presentation by Ed Lohrenz of Geo-Xergy at this summer's ASHRAE Montreal conference that discussed a hybrid with snow melt, I think in Alberta.

Of course, you want to take care in not making the system too complex - more than one supplemental heat sink added on and the system may get tough to control. Controls of basic cooling-dominated hybrid approaches are covered in a couple recent papers: http://www.hvac.okstate.edu/research/Documents/Theses%20and%20reports/Xu_Thesis_2007.pdf and www.ecw.org/hybrid<http://www.ecw.org/hybrid> . These don't deal with snow melt systems though, so they won't answer the question about placement of the control sensor in a snow melt system. Seems to me that what Nick alluded to, putting the sensor in the asphalt or concrete itself, would make the most sense.

Good luck!

Hi all!

 

Our problem is, that different reviewers want to see different things.

 

Our first project NC 2.2 Platinum was accepted without any clarification 3
years ago. For the next project, same version we used the same tool, model,
reports ? everything ? we needed two clarifications, had to pay extra money
etc. because of missing results, input files, report structure etc. Based on
this clarified project we did three more whole building simulation were we
got 20 ? 30 comments to clarify. 

 

Projects were all very much the same, so different systems can?t be the
reason. And due to the missing direct communication, it is sometimes hard to
get to know what the reviewer has in mind. 

 

We would appreciate 

-       more details about what is definitely necessary (nobody tells us, if
it is too much information), 

-       what is obsolete,

-       the same reviewer for earch project as far as possible because he is
familiar with the structure of documents etc

-       a way of direct communication after the first review?

 

Does somebody know how much time reviewers have for Minimum/Optimize Energy
Performance / how much money they get?

 

Regards Johannes

Betreff: [Bldg-sim] Suggestions for model reviews

 

Recently, I?ve had an odd string of personal contacts and strangers alike
confiding with me and demonstrating their frustrations over energy model
reviews.  As an outside-party, it?s actually largely entertaining to hear,
and puts a few things in perspective.  We are all human, and we all share
common emotions when put under the spotlight, but how we put those feelings
to action makes all the difference between an easy/productive review process
and a train wreck?

 

I?ve had the pleasure of treading both paths, and I thought it might be
helpful for modelers of all skill/experience levels to share a few tips I?ve
developed to manage the stress-level in your energy model reviews.  A few
reviewers out there might also benefit to turn this advice around and apply
it to their practices as well:

 

1.       Do not assume your reviewer knows less than you.  

a.       Recognize that stuff gets lost in translation ? energy modeling
minutiae are rarely easy to communicate in text format.

b.      It?s human to feel annoyed when your work is questioned, but practice
patience.  Odds are you and/or your reviewer are going to learn something as
a result. 

c.       If you ever catch yourself thinking/responding in a dismissive or
condescending fashion, stop.  Your heart is in the wrong place (however right
you might be) and you?re missing the point of an objective review.  Take a
breather!

2.       Do not assume your reviewer knows more than you, either.  

a.       Do not be afraid to challenge or question a query, but prepare and
present a solid case for any contrary position.  

b.      It is very easy to run yourself in circles trying to explain/justify
yourself when it isn?t really necessary.  

c.       Reviewers can and should make it plain when an in-depth explanation
is required.

3.       Be prepared to change your mind!  For better or for worse, reviews
are ultimately beneficial to all parties involved, because they provide an
excellent opportunity to learn a thing or two.  Allow your personal expertise
to continually evolve and incorporate, or at least recognize, others?
perspectives and practices.  They may serve you well personally in the
future!

4.       Once in a while, you may have to work with an individual who is
truly stubborn, unreasonable and is not willing to participate in any
objective discussion.  If a review should fail to ?close out? over such
behavior, the best you can hope for is to document communications so you can
later make apparent in hindsight that you were proactive, and pulling your
weight to move the process forward.  

 

If anyone has similar guiding principles or tips to share (from either side
of the reviewing fence), I think it would be much appreciated =)!

 

~Nick

James,

Building envelopes should reflect existing conditions prior to any revisions per ASHRAE 90.1-2007 Table G3.1.5.f in Baseline Building Performance except for additions and alterations which is covered in paragraph c of the same article.

I wonder if the pre-renovation schedules will also help to save a lot of energy also?  Could it be justified?

A resistance heater, converting 100% of its input electricity to output heat
would have a *3.41214 EER* (COP = 1), due to the fact that it takes about
0.293071 watt hours <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt_hours> to equal one

Take* EER = COP x 3.412*

These curves are better explained in iesVE Software.

Hi Deepak

I think you can specify destratification fans so that would essentially be the same. Other than that you could try splitting the zone in 2 and letting internal air transfer between the zones work out the exchange but that's not really the ideal way to do it.

Otherwise you probably need to think CFD and you'd be in the realms of moving mesh transient CFD then and I wouldn't recommend that.

Not an easy one to solve really.
Regards
Paul

I would take a different approach - concentrate on comfort reporting.  Not sure
if E+ reports Fanger PPD or PMV but you could do this in ESP-r by cranking up the air
velocity used for comfort calculations.  And impose high heat transfer for convection
either via fixed heat transfer coefficients or a fan hc regime.  This might allow you
to avoid CFD.

Deepak ,

 

If your focus is indeed thermal comfort, within IES VE you can, if
desired, adjust heat transfer coefficients for surfaces, which will
influence radiant comfort, and in the results viewer adjust the air
velocity for thermal comfort analysis. 

 

If you wish to look at any one simulation time step in more detail, you
can then export the boundary conditions, etc. to the CFD module in the
VE and look at local air velocities and thermal comfort in a space with
the ceiling fan, or at least a reasonable approximation of such a fan. 

 

If you wish to look at the energy saving potential for ceiling fans, you
may first want to study the thermal comfort implications with respect to
room temperature set points (i.e., can you use a higher cooling set
point to achieve the desired level of thermal comfort with the ceiling
fan). Having done so, you can then run the energy model with adjusted
set points to determine energy savings and re-check the thermal comfort
analysis to ensure that the design requirements throughout the simulated
time period will be met with the adjusted set points plus ceiling fans. 

 

Regards,

Timothy

I think this level of detail in modeling is unnecessary. In fact, I don't think there's 
need for any enhancements to the thermal modeling
of the building to assess the comfort benefits of ceiling fans.   Ceiling fans do not 
change the thermal conditions of the space (except for
a little added heat generated by the fan motor).  It provides comfort through air motion 
experienced by the occupants.   The improved
comfort can be quantified explicitly using Fanger's equation,  or implicitly if you 
calculate an equivalent temperature to that with still air.

Hello Johannes,

In response to your concerns...

1) If you are referring to? guidance on LEED building modeling, you might consider the following manual
http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=7795

2) While doing literature review for taking LEED NC v2.2, I remember that I read somewhere that? one-hour conference call could be scheduled? (for a fee) to provide an opportunity for
 direct dialog between reviewer and project's design team responsible 
parties.? I am not sure and? you should check this with GBCI.

Hope this helps.
Cheers, Sasa

Hi all! ?Our problem is, that different reviewers want to see different things. ?Our first project NC 2.2 Platinum was accepted without any clarification 3 years ago. For the next project, same version we used the same tool, model, reports ? everything ? we needed two clarifications, had to pay extra money etc. because of missing results, input files, report structure etc. Based on this clarified project we did three more whole building simulation were we got 20 ? 30 comments to clarify.  ?Projects were all very much the same, so different systems can?t be the reason. And due to the missing direct communication, it is sometimes hard to get to know what the reviewer has in mind.  ?We would appreciate -?????? more details about what is definitely necessary (nobody tells us, if it is too much information), -?????? what is obsolete,-?????? the same reviewer for earch project as far as possible because he is familiar with the

Betreff: [Bldg-sim] Suggestions for model reviews ?Recently, I?ve had an odd string of personal contacts and strangers alike confiding with me and demonstrating their frustrations over energy model reviews.? As an outside-party, it?s actually largely entertaining to hear, and puts a few things in perspective.? We are all human, and we all share common emotions when put under the spotlight, but how we put those feelings to action makes all the difference between an easy/productive review process and a train wreck? ?I?ve had the pleasure of treading both paths, and I thought it might be helpful for modelers of all skill/experience levels to share a few tips I?ve developed to manage the stress-level in your energy model reviews.? A few reviewers out there might also benefit to turn this advice around and apply it to their practices as well: ?1.?????? Do not assume your reviewer knows less than you. ?a.?????? Recognize that stuff
 gets lost in translation ? energy modeling minutiae are rarely easy to communicate in text format.b.????? It?s human to feel annoyed when your work is questioned, but practice patience.? Odds are you and/or your reviewer are going to learn something as a result. c.?????? If you ever catch yourself thinking/responding in a dismissive or condescending fashion, stop.? Your heart is in the wrong place (however right you might be) and you?re missing the point of an objective review.? Take a breather!2.?????? Do not assume your reviewer knows more than you, either.? a.?????? Do not be afraid to challenge or question a query, but prepare and present a solid case for any contrary position.? b.????? It is very easy to run yourself in circles trying to explain/justify yourself when it isn?t really necessary. ?c.?????? Reviewers can and should make it plain when an in-depth explanation is required.3.?????? Be
 prepared to change your mind!? For better or for worse, reviews are ultimately beneficial to all parties involved, because they provide an excellent opportunity to learn a thing or two. ?Allow your personal expertise to continually evolve and incorporate, or at least recognize, others? perspectives and practices.? They may serve you well personally in the future!4.?????? Once in a while, you may have to work with an individual who is truly stubborn, unreasonable and is not willing to participate in any objective discussion.? If a review should fail to ?close out? over such behavior, the best you can hope for is to document communications so you can later make apparent in hindsight that you were proactive, and pulling your weight to move the process forward.?  ?If anyone has similar guiding principles or tips to share (from either side of the reviewing fence), I think it would be much appreciated =)! ?~Nick ? ?NICK CATON, P.E.SENIOR

Okay, Smart peoples:

I have an existing glass (say Solar Bronze) which has properties of SHGC, VT, and U-Value. I now wish to take this same glass and add a film on top of it to further enhance the SHGC and VT properties.

I cannot just take a diferent window from the Glass Library, because I do not know the additive SHGC and VT effects.  Is there any way to do a "glass-layers" operation? Or must I just guess at a glass that MIGHT be the equivalent?

Thanks.

Hi,

We recently modeled the effect of ceiling fans by estimating the airflow
(based on rpm, diameter & manufacturer data etc) that the fan would create
and corelating it with the guidelines of ASHRAE 55 for increased airflow.
We used a higher cooling set point to compute the energy savings for fans
following the exact methodology as pointed out by Mr Moore in this thread. The
fan power was added to the model as an equipment load. However, this was
done in DOE2.

Dear Paulo,

You may want to take a look at DesignBuilder. It is a program that I have
started to use and am quite happy with its effective graphic user interface
as well as its visual delivery of results. It uses DOE's Energy+ program in
its algorithms which is a well established software on its own. There is a
month long free trial plus helpful online tutorials on how to use the
program's features.
Perhaps spending some time on this program may help you get a better feel on
what the advantages and limitations of these simulations are.

Regards,

Ali Yaras
