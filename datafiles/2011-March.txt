Wiley & Sons Publisher, Chap 2.10 - Beam and Diffuse Components of Hourly
Radiation (taken from Erbs et al):

I_d / I = 1.0 - 0.09 * k_t   for k_t <= 0.22
          = 0.9511 - 0.1604 * k_t + 4.388*k_t^2 - 16.638*k_t^3 +12.336*k_t^4
for 0.22 < = k_t <= 0.8
          = 0.165 for k_t > 0.80

where:
   I_d / I = diffuse fraction of hourly total horiz radiation
   k_t = hourly clearness index

You should read the section before you apply this. Your engineering library
should have a copy. If not, let me know and I'll fax you a copy.

Good luck.

-----------------------

AIR-CONDITIONING CREDITS

Specific air conditioning credits vary substantially from case style to case
style. Case loads are made up of internal electric loads, radiant heat from
exterior lighting (very substantial on top display cases), wall conduction
and the infiltration load which is a combination of sensible and latent
heat. Manufacturers also usually add some percentage for safety to account
for loading techniques, traffic, warm product and times of poor ambient
control. It would not be practical to try and exactly calculate the credit
for each style of case and its application. A general rule is acceptable
that takes into account the mix of cases in a typical store since the air
conditioning calculation itself is partly an educated guess particularly
considering outside air influences and person loads.

Only open cases should be considered for this calculation. Walkin coolers
and freezers and glass door merchandisers should not be used. The following
credit is then usually acceptable and should be calculated using the total
published open case load.

	sensible credit = 40%
	latent credit = 30%

-----------------------



Can someone comment on the disparity between the above numbers and the
respective 65%-10% credits in DOE2.1E?
Also, should it be understood that closed cases should not be considered as
zone loads in a DOE2.1 simulation?
Has anyone had trouble using the REFG-SENS-SCH and REFG-LAT-SCH commands?
The results I get with or without schedules are identical.




Thank you again for your help.

REFG-ZONE-LOAD	is the total cooling effect...

			Manufacturers of supermarket cases usually do not
list the
			total cooling effect of their cases directly.
Instead, they list the
			compressor capacity at a standard suction
temperature
			required per lineal foot of case work. The sensible
cooling effect
			is typically 65% of this number, and the latent
cooling effect is
			about 10%. The total cooling effect is then about
75% of the
			listed compressor capacity per lineal foot,
multiplied by the
			lineal feet of case work.

Does this mean that 75% of the compressor's cooling capacity cools the zone?
Where does the other 25% disappear to?
Do these figures vary depending on ambient conditions?
Are there any references for these numbers (ASHRAE or otherwise)?

Any and all help is greatly appreciated.

expensive, particularly when you have to rate the HX for high pressures.
There are two kinds of plate HXs, gasketed and soldered.  Getting a
soldered type sort of defeats one of the main advantages of a
plate-frame type HX, its expandability.  The gasketed type for
high-pressure applications are less in supply and as a result cost a
lot.  The highest-pressure rating I've seen for a gasketed-type
plate-frame HX is 300 psia.

=20

My following comments apply to a gasketed-type plate-frame heat
exchanger.

=20

(1) How high do you want to go?  This is really an indirect question
related to the fill pressure of the system, the location of the
expansion tank, and the location of the HX in the system.  Note that
when you fill the system, you need an addition 2 to 5 psig of pressure
to allow the water to spit out of the top of the system, ensuring the
entire system is filled and most (if not all) of the air is out.  (2) By
putting the HX at the pump discharge means you will feel the full impact
of the dynamic head of the pump and static head of the system at that
location.  Not the best place in large systems like campuses or district
energy plants. (3) When including the comments provided in (2)
previously, one can then note that you can eliminate the dynamic head
from the equation.  (4) HX exposed to all of the static head plus the
dynamic head depending upon the placement of the pump in relation to the
HX.  (5) Your static head is minimum, and dynamic head is again only
that contribution depending on the pump's placement in relation to the
HX.  Note this is probably your cheapest plate-frame HX since the
pressure is probably the lowest (assuming the expansion tank is also
located at the suction inlet of the pump).  (6) I don't know exactly
what you mean here.

=20

As for what are the issues when the HX is replaced with other equipment
such as chillers and boilers:  this will depend upon the system you are
dealing with.  Are there existing chillers and boilers being displaced
by this replacement?  Why?  Is it of economic benefit to the owner?
Higher efficient device?  Perhaps you are referring to the approach
temperature.  Note the closer the approach temperature, the more
expensive the heat exchanger.  However, the closer the approach
temperature, the more efficient the system.  For example, if you have a
chilled-water system circulating water at a 14 delta T, and you have a
heat exchanger with a 2 degree approach, then the load side of the heat
exchanger operates at a 10 degree delta T.  If you have the same chiller
system circulating water at 14 degrees delta T and you have a 1-degree
approach, then your load side of the heat exchanger can operate at a
12-degree delta T.  As you can intuitively see, the one-degree approach
HX provides for a more efficient system.

Subject: [bldg-sim] Pump location

=20

I am looking for information (articles, research papers, case studies)
on the effect of the location of the pump relative to a plate and frame
heat exchanger in a closed piping system.  Some of the issues are (1)
the vertical height of the piping system (1000' to 2000'), how high can
you go, (2) pumping thru HX, (3) pumping away from HX, (4) pump and HX
located at bottom of system, (5) pump and HX at top of system, and (6)
pump start up.  What are the issues when the HX is replaced with other
equipment such as chillers and boilers?

Message-ID: <mailman.11.1300306403.15696.bldg-sim-onebuilding.org@lists.onebuilding.org>

particularly when you have to rate the HX for high pressures.  There are two
kinds of plate HXs, gasketed and soldered.  Getting a soldered type sort of
defeats one of the main advantages of a plate-frame type HX, its
expandability.  The gasketed type for high-pressure applications are less in
supply and as a result cost a lot.  The highest-pressure rating I've seen
for a gasketed-type plate-frame HX is 300 psia.
 
My following comments apply to a gasketed-type plate-frame heat exchanger.
 
(1) How high do you want to go?  This is really an indirect question related
to the fill pressure of the system, the location of the expansion tank, and
the location of the HX in the system.  Note that when you fill the system,
you need an addition 2 to 5 psig of pressure to allow the water to spit out
of the top of the system, ensuring the entire system is filled and most (if
not all) of the air is out.  (2) By putting the HX at the pump discharge
means you will feel the full impact of the dynamic head of the pump and
static head of the system at that location.  Not the best place in large
systems like campuses or district energy plants. (3) When including the
comments provided in (2) previously, one can then note that you can
eliminate the dynamic head from the equation.  (4) HX exposed to all of the
static head plus the dynamic head depending upon the placement of the pump
in relation to the HX.  (5) Your static head is minimum, and dynamic head is
again only that contribution depending on the pump's placement in relation
to the HX.  Note this is probably your cheapest plate-frame HX since the
pressure is probably the lowest (assuming the expansion tank is also located
at the suction inlet of the pump).  (6) I don't know exactly what you mean
here.
 
As for what are the issues when the HX is replaced with other equipment such
as chillers and boilers:  this will depend upon the system you are dealing
with.  Are there existing chillers and boilers being displaced by this
replacement?  Why?  Is it of economic benefit to the owner?  Higher
efficient device?  Perhaps you are referring to the approach temperature.
Note the closer the approach temperature, the more expensive the heat
exchanger.  However, the closer the approach temperature, the more efficient
the system.  For example, if you have a chilled-water system circulating
water at a 14 delta T, and you have a heat exchanger with a 2 degree
approach, then the load side of the heat exchanger operates at a 10 degree
delta T.  If you have the same chiller system circulating water at 14
degrees delta T and you have a 1-degree approach, then your load side of the
heat exchanger can operate at a 12-degree delta T.  As you can intuitively
see, the one-degree approach HX provides for a more efficient system.
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Eric Kirchhoff, PE

Subject: [bldg-sim] Pump location
 
I am looking for information (articles, research papers, case studies) on
the effect of the location of the pump relative to a plate and frame heat
exchanger in a closed piping system.  Some of the issues are (1) the
vertical height of the piping system (1000' to 2000'), how high can you go,
(2) pumping thru HX, (3) pumping away from HX, (4) pump and HX located at
bottom of system, (5) pump and HX at top of system, and (6) pump start up.
What are the issues when the HX is replaced with other equipment such as
chillers and boilers?

using Con-Ed steam and electric rates you mentioned, for a typical =
office building you will see a benefit in using steam-turbine chillers =
(either option 2 and 3, depending on your electrical load factor and =
refrigeration full load hours). Of course, assuming that in all the =
cases you use reasonably efficient refrigeration machines.

Here is how you do it in Doe2.1:

Then in PLANT PARAMETRS you specify=20

Hope this helps.

  Steve:



  I received other responses suggesting the same thing:



  1. Use 2 stage absorption chiller with HIR of the turbine

  2. Assign PLR curves of centrifugal chiller to corresponding curves of =
absorption machine.



  I assume this will produce reasonably accurate steam consumption of =
the steam-turbine.  I need a sample DOE2 Plant "inp" or "bdl" statements =
showing how to do this.  The chillers in question are York model YST.  =
York will provide the performance data.  The location is NYC and the =
utility rates are ConEd Steam Service Classification 2 (lower rates in =
summer) and ConEd Electric Service Classification 9 Rate II - General =
Large Time of Use=20



  =
http://q050-www5.coned.com/es/tariffs/ps.asp?URL=3Dtariffs.htm&s=3Dtariff=
s



  Since there are several buildings in NYC that use a hybrid plant of =
steam-turbine and electric-motor drive chillers, I assume studies have =
already been done justifying this combination.  So far I have found the =
ASHRAE Sept 2003 article: Advances in Steam Cooling by Ian Spanswick



  I would like to compare the following alternative options: (1) two =
2000-ton electric-drive chillers, (2) two 2000-ton steam-drive chillers =
and (3) one 2000-ton electric-drive chiller and one 2000-ton steam-drive =
chiller sequenced to "start first" based on ConEd year-round steam and =
electric rates.  This would be for (A) a building that operates 24 hours =
per day such as a hospital, and (B) an office building that operates 7 =
AM - 6 PM, Mon-Fri.  I would also like to see a life cycle cost analysis =
of the alternative options.  Have such studies been done for buildings =
located in cities with district steam (NYC, Boston, Philadelphia, =
Minneapolis)?



  The Trane TRACE700 program (which we also use in this office along =
with Carrier's HAP program) models steam-turbine chillers.  However the =
building in question has already been modeled in detail with DOE2.1E =
using electric chillers.  I prefer to use DOE2.1E directly (we also have =
eQUEST and EnergyPro in the office) for LEED certification and to show =
Code compliance.  The building description language (bdl) provides =
flexibility and it can be read like a specification for others to =
review.  Does this program have a future?  How many A-E design firms are =
using EnergyPlus on large commercial building projects?

  You would need to model it as an absorption chiller.  The chiller's =
heat input ratio and performance curves would need to reflect the =
combination of the steam turbine and the chiller compressor.

You can expect reasonable energy delivery (approx 40% efficiency) up to 10 C
(20 F) above ambient temperature.  This assumes that the building surfaces
are oriented toward the sun.  To get higher temperatures you would need
glazed collectors.  Might not be a bad idea for free heat and would reduce
the cooling load slightly.  I would hate to have to service clogged or
broken pipes that are embedded in concrete.  Use cross linked poly ethylene
pipe with an oxygen barrier.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Solar hot water heat collectors integrated into the
envelope?

Does anyone have any experience using pipes integrated into the building
envelope as solar collectors?  

I am involved in a project in Mexico where the design team would like
to incorporate solar hot water heating as much as possible but don't
like the look of standard commercial solar collectors.  As an
alternative, they are interested in embedding pipes in the roof surface.
 The pipes would be covered in a thin layer of concrete (or possibly
copper roofing).  This is obviously not the most efficient system but
the site receives a lot of sun and there is a large roof area available.
 

Has anyone heard of similar installations?  Any suggestions based on
past experience?  Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Catherine

(cold winter) climates, I have seen where a heating dominated building =
=3D
heating dominated climate; has been turned into a cooling dominated
building because of over-design with energy conserving strategies (ie
too high of R-values and use of heat recovery), in addition to ignoring
the type of occupancy and/or the hours of operation of the building.  I
understand that this doesn't help you directly, but I wanted to support
Mitchell's comments about fully knowing your building and it's occupancy
in order to understand why you might be seeing your energy results go in
the opposite direction of what you would initally expect.

Also you might find that using high performance glazing such as the
values you are proposing (might I assume this is a Visionwall or heat
mirror glazing assembly performance) are truly more beneficial in
eliminating the need (and Capital cost) of installing a perimeter
heating system.  The reason being, with this high R-value performance of
the glazing system, you have neutralized the skin losses, and the
situation may actually become more of a thermal comfort issue, rather
than an energy conserving issue.  I had this exact thing happen when
trying to apply and model the Visionwall 4-element (triple-pane
equivalent) glazing system to a University building in Winnepeg,
Manitoba.  The true benefit of the application of the U =3D 0.19
performance value I was modelling was not in the energy savings, but in
the lack of need to install a perimeter heating system, ultimately
saving the project over $90,000 capital cost and resulting in less than
a 1 year payback for the University.  The short payback was associated
more with the offset of capital cost, rather than the energy cost
savings for the high performance glazing.

Hope this gives you more ideas to think about.

When using a "high performance glazing" you need to be careful.  Every
building has a different signature (i.e. different shape, size,
occupancy, climate, etc.)  Therefore, one should be careful to say a
"high performance"
glazing is better than a lesser performance glazing.  It is best to
model a wide range of u-values such that you can see which glazing is
optimal for the specific building.  Often, one will see that a
manufacturer says it is "high performance" which it is on its own.  But,
couple that with your wall insulation and the "high performance" wall
configuration requires a different u-value.
=20
You will see a point of diminishing return and in many cases a point at
which the lower window u-value coupled with your wall insulation will in
fact cause one load to go up and the other to go down or vice versa,
depending on your climate.  This is also similar in determining when you
have too much or too little insulation.  What "high performance"
glazings do is allow an opportunity to determine what the most cost
effective path is, decreased window u-value or increased wall
insulation.  Therefore, one is able to have several optimization paths.
=20
I find it convenient to produce a graphical representation (excel is
pretty easy for this) to graph the variable versus the desired output
(energy used or dollars saved, if a LEED project).
=20
I hope this helps.

Subject: [bldg-sim] High Performance Glazing



I am modeling high performance glazing with U=3D0.14, SC=3D0.35 and
comparing to typical 1" thick insulating low-e glass with U=3D0.33,
SC=3D0.76.  Climate is midwest US and 86% of the glass is facing north.
The north wall is basically all glass and spandrel. Heating is suppied
from district steam supply.

Results show increased steam energy consumption from February through
September with high performance glazing and less for remaining winter
months. HVAC system is VAV with hot water reheat coils.

Overall annual steam energy consumption reduction is very small. I
expected to see significant heating energy savings due to increased
perimeter R-value. Has anyone modeled high performance glazing and seen
similar results?=20

I am from Vienna / Austria and PE for the design of computer rooms.

We design computer rooms with a host and storage or server farms(meaning
several racks with blade servers not only a single server).

It starts with redundancy for infrastructure like AC, UPS or generator =
and
also fire detection and extinguisher systems, access control, even =
special
cells which are tight against water, smoke, dust, etc.

Betreff: [bldg-sim] "computer rooms" not what they used to be

Having worked in design, I certainly do not concur.  My experience does
not indicate 115F commonality.  Where I worked, the standard practice
was to work with the owners and the people responsible for the
electronic equipment (whether it is computers or telephone switchers).
On top of the interviews, we built in a 2- to 3-times factor of safety
to allow for the ever advancing electronics technology which can pack
more and more Wattage into the same small box.  From talking with other
designers from other firms, this appeared to be standard protocol.
Remember, the market will dictate the poor designers from the good ones,
and the last thing you want to do is anger a customer from a sector that
is continually expanding.

I believe your experience is either witnessing computer rooms that the
owner performed ad hoc in an old storage room or closet, or possibly is
perhaps a decade old, and the owner had exceeded the FS put into the
design.  My experience indicates that in some cases, a FS of 3 can be
surpassed in as little as 5 years.  This is an extreme example where the
owner changed the functionality of the site.  Something the designer can
not allow for, or else the price would skyrocket.

I am not sure what ASHRAE says to do in this case, but it is an
irresponsible designer who cannot assess the job at hand and use the
most appropriate resources to provide for the scope of work.

Subject: [bldg-sim] "computer rooms" not what they used to be

It seems to me that HVAC professionals and IT professionals don't at all
mean the same thing when they talk about a "computer room." A couple
decades ago computer rooms still had interior glassed windows, one
locked door, a raised floor, held a "mainframe" computer, and had their
own A/C. But computers have gotten a whole lot smaller and "big iron" is
rare now.

Nowadays when an elevation plan says "computer room," that room will
commonly have few or no windows, no special doors, no hollow floor, hold
a whole bunch of "minicomputers" and "PC"s and "network hubs" and "UPS"s
on shelves or racks, and rely on the building A/C. Unfortunately the
computer equipment still generates a _huge_ amount of heat (even more
than the "mainframe" it replaced), which must be carried away (or
neutralized) immediately.

Overheated computer equipment becomes unreliable and has its lifespan
shortened significantly. But it seldom fails right away, so both HVAC
professionals and facility managers can easily be completely unaware of
the problem. It's all too common for a computer technician to arrive at
the office Monday morning only to find the "computer room" is 115
degrees; costly equipment had its life shortened before anyone even knew
there was a problem. There should at minimum be a temperature alarm in
the "computer room."

After complaining about the difference between common sense and what
building simulation programs recommend, I was told this disconnect is
due to "standard ASHRAE methodology" and not a flaw in any particular
building simulation tool. I feel it's time for the heating and cooling
profession to catch up with the reality of current "computer rooms."

This is just my two cents; what do other people think?

=20
Infiltration Coefficient (Door)
=20
Used to compute infiltration of outside air due to cracks around the =
door frame.
=20
Required if the Infiltration Method is Crack, unused otherwise.
=20
DOE-2 uses the following equation to calculate the infiltration:
=20
infiltration air flow (cfm) =3D (Infiltration Coefficient) =B4 =D6P =B4 =
L
=20
where:
=20
P =3D The pressure differential between the inside and outside air =
(inches of water)
=20
L =3D crack length (ft)
=20
The table below lists typical values for the Infiltration Coefficient, =
based on the size of the crack.
See Infiltration and Natural Ventilation.
=20
DOE-2 Command: DOOR
=20
DOE-2 Keyword: INF-COEF;I-C
=20
Type of Door Infiltration Coefficient (cfm/ft =D6inches of water )
Residential Door (3 ft by 7 ft)=20
closed, with weather stripping 2.4
average use without weather stripping 12
average use with weather stripping 9.8
Office Door (3.5 ft by 7 ft)=20
closed 3.1
open 10% of the time 13.5
open 25% of the time 55

Revolving Door=20
average use 12
Garage or Shipping Room Door=20
no use 6
average use 60
Note: This table is based on a wind speed of 7.5 mph (which corresponds =
to approximately 0.5 inches of water), in a direction normal to the =
wall.

Marcus,

I am on the ASHRAE 90.1 ECB subcommittee. I do not think at this point
that we are working on any additional methodology to credit natural
ventilation. Addendum AG already changed the following:

In the proposed building.
HVAC Fan Schedules. Schedules for HVAC fans that provide outdoor air
for
ventilation shall run continuously whenever spaces are occupied and
shall be cycled on and off to meet heating and cooling loads during
unoccupied hours. 

This implies that HVAC fans that are only meeting thermal load may
cycle
on and off, and was meant to allow fan credit for natural ventilation
system (as simple as operable windows). The proposed building still
calls for cooling as a requirement, but the thought is, that if model
simulates natural ventilation and the cooling load is met that way,
the
fan and cooling coil will not operate to meet load and the design will
be credited. The problem is that most LEED models are done using DOE2,
which has severe limitations when it comes to modeling natural
ventilation. It is my understanding that other programs do a better
job
of this.  

The subcommittee also thought that an exceptional calculation method
might be used if the natural ventilation simulation was be done in a
stand alone program and then an appropriate infiltration schedule was
input into a program like DOE2, reducing the use of mechanical
cooling.

Mike,

 

The exception calculation method you describe is absolutely correct.

 

Obtaining savings for natural ventilation within LEED however is
another
story.  I am one of the certification reviewers and also vice-chair of
the EA TAG.  My understanding is that to date the USGBC has not
allowed
natural ventilation to fully count under EAc1 even if submitted as an
exceptional calculation method.  The TAG is awaiting the work of the
90.1 subcommittee you mention to develop a uniform methodology.

 

Perhaps your submission will be the one to set the precedent.  Thanks
to
all for helping to blaze the trail.

Have you succeeded in getting a naturally ventilated building through
the USGBC with this method?

 

If so, I am sure all would be glad to hear it.

Ramana,

 

The ASHRAE 90.1 ECB sub-committee is working on a methodology for
simulating natural ventilation within the framework of Appendix G but
I
don't think its finished yet.  In the meantime here is what I would
recommend.

 

Appendix G / 90.1 ECB allows you to use an exception calculation
method
to simulate hybrid systems or unique efficiency measures to
demonstrate
above-standard performance.  I think this would certainly apply in
your
case.   

 

Here's what I have done on projects requiring an exception calculation
method.  

1. Establish your energy cost budget and your design energy case
following the Appendix G guidelines.  

2. Create a second model using the Design Energy Case as the baseline
and make the necessary modifications to simulate radiant heating / no
cooling via natural ventilation.  

3. Report the energy savings from your exception calculation as a line
item at the end of your LEED EA-1 summary table (similar to how
renewable energy is reported). 

4.  Include a seperate summary table  for the exception calculation
showing the energy end-use breakdown and how you arrived at the cost
savings. 
Show
both the baseline and proposed energy use.  

5. Make sure the savings are reasonable and prudent for the system you
are proposing.  

6. Document any changes to the model especially changes to schedules
that were necessary to properly simulate your system. 

7. Make it easy for someone to review your assumptions and the
methodology you used to estimate the savings

 

I hope this helps.  Good luck.

 

Mike

Dear all,

Is ignoring natural ventilation in both proposed and baseline designs
an
accepted/fair way of modeling based on Appendix G (ASHRAE 90.1-2004)?

Part of the proposed design has (radiant heating + natural
ventilation)
with no cooling which was modeled as a radiant slab, no cooling,
natural
ventilation ignored. 

But the Baseline HVAC system based on Appendix G is System 5: Packaged
VAV w/Reheat. (Natural ventilation can be modeled based on Air Change
method or Sherman Grimsrud method though I do not know how to do it).

I cannot decide how to make the baseline and proposed comparable with
respect to Natural Ventilation (in a manner acceptable to LEED
review),
suggestions will be appreciated.

Thanks,

thermal efficiency can be used to isolate the small jacket losses for a
given boiler. However this doesn't translate directly into DOE2.2.
STANDBY-TIME is used to account for these losses.=20

=20

When setting up a boiler in DOE-2 or eQuest, what are realistic values
you users have applied for STANDBY-TIME?

=20

The DOE2.2 manual volume 2 defines STANDBY-TIME as "The number of hours
of equivalent full-load time required to maintain a boiler at
temperature, when the heating load is zero.  When operating below the
MIN-RATIO, the boiler is assumed to be cycling.  When cycled on, the
boiler will operate at the MIN-RATIO.  When off, losses and energy are
determined using this keyword.  The program interpolates between energy
consumed at the MIN-RATIO, and energy in full standby mode; based on the
fraction of the time the boiler is cycled on."=20

=20

Is the DOE-2 default of 0.016 hours realistic?

thermal efficiency can be used to isolate the small jacket losses for a

STANDBY-TIME is used to account for these losses.=20

=20

When setting up a boiler in DOE-2 or eQuest, what are realistic values
you users have applied for STANDBY-TIME?

=20

The DOE2.2 manual volume 2 defines STANDBY-TIME as "The number of hours
of equivalent full-load time required to maintain a boiler at
temperature, when the heating load is zero.  When operating below the
MIN-RATIO, the boiler is assumed to be cycling.  When cycled on, the
boiler will operate at the MIN-RATIO.  When off, losses and energy are

consumed at the MIN-RATIO, and energy in full standby mode; based on the

Is the DOE-2 default of 0.016 hours realistic?

Subject: [bldg-sim] eQUEST window baseline


Hello,

I am creating an energy model for a LEED project.  In "baselining" the =
building, one of the stipulations of ASHRAE 90.1 2004 is that the =
windows must be evenly distributed in horizontal bands on each facet of =
the facade.  My building has 17 facets due to a somewhat complicated =
design and I am wondering if anyone knows a relatively straightforward =
way to accomplish that distribution.  One of my problems is that in the =
Design Development Wizard, there are only 4 areas in which to enter =
percentages (N., E., S., W.) which doesn't seem to work on a building =
with so many facets.  On the other hand, it seems tedious to go into =
each window and adjust its percentage.  Is there a more elegant way to =
adjust window proportions globally?  I am thinking a parametric run =
might be the best solution.  Can anyone provide some insight on this?

Thank you!
Andrew McNamara

"EnergyGauge Summit is a Windows(R) based product with a flexible graphical
user interface. EnergyGauge Summit performs Florida energy code compliance
for commercial buildings based on the ASHRAE (American Society of Heating,
Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers) standard 90.1-2001. The
premier version adds ASHRAE 90.1-2004, Appendix G ratings tax deduction
reports and LEED energy performance reports. An overview of features is

Does anyone have experience or thoughts?  Drawbacks? Usability? Accuracy?
I'm looking to get a conversation started here, because I didn't find
anything in the archive on this program.

Best,

1. Lower the Space temperature to 68F.=20
2. Using the FPH system in eQUEST. This doesn't allow for cooling
however, and uses no fans (we still have air supply in our building).=20

3. Andrew Craig suggested inputting the capacity of the radiant system
as an internal energy source. (This is great because it allows the fans
to cycle on/off and maintains the cooling side. It doesn't calculate
heating loads on the radiant slab though)

What I plan to do is use the FPH system and setback the thermostat to
68F in these spaces. This will allow me to calculate the heating energy
on the radiant coil. I then plan to use Andrew's "internal energy
source" method to calculate the airside system loads, and add the FPH
heat load to that.=20

Does this seem like a reasonable method to model this?=20

1. Lower the Space temperature to 68F.
2. Using the FPH system in eQUEST. This doesn't allow for cooling
however, and uses no fans (we still have air supply in our building).=20
3. Andrew Craig suggested inputting the capacity of the radiant system
as an internal energy source. (This is great because it allows the fans
to cycle on/off and maintains the cooling side. It doesn't calculate
heating loads on the radiant slab though)

What I plan to do is use the FPH system and setback the thermostat to
68F in these spaces. This will allow me to calculate the heating energy
on the radiant coil. I then plan to use Andrew's "internal energy
source" method to calculate the airside system loads, and add the FPH
heat load to that.=20

Does this seem like a reasonable method to model this?

A great DOE2.2 feature would be the ability to create boilers and =

specific combinations of keywords without having to recreate from =

A few more comments regarding boilers:

We based the default curve for atmospheric boilers on information =
received from a Northern California manufacturer's representative. The =
default atmospheric boiler consumes 45% fuel at 40% part load, so =
efficiency does deteriorate. At full load, the efficiency is 80%; =
calculated as (PLR=3D1.) / (HIR=3D1.25).  At 40% load, the default curve =
yields an efficiency of 71%; calculated as (PLR=3D0.40) / (HIR=3D1.25 * =
HIRfPLR=3D0.45).=20

We believe that a 71% efficiency at 40% load is reasonable for a modern =
atmospheric boiler. The default was based on a packaged water-tube =
boiler with internal convective recirculation, but performance for other =
types is expected to be similar.=20

The default atmospheric boiler unloads to 40% part-load ratio, and then =
starts to cycle on/off; the HIRfPLR curve is valid only for part-load =
ratios above 40%. The loss during the off-cycle is characterized by the =
"standby time", which is the equivalent full-load time in hours required =
to keep the boiler hot, if the boiler has no load at all. The default is =
0.027 hours, meaning that, at no load, the boiler would have to run =
about 2 minutes/hour at full load to offset the jacket and flue losses. =
The documentation describes the use of the standby-time vs. the =
part-load curve in further detail. At very low loads, efficiency is =
seriously degraded; by definition the efficiency at 0% load is 0%. You =
can observe this if you set up an hourly report for the boiler and =
observe it at very low loads.=20

Our experience to date is that manufacturer's part-load data for boiler =
performance is quite difficult to obtain. If any of you have =
well-documented data that deviates significantly from the defaults, we =
would appreciate hearing from you. As eQUEST/DOE-2 supports a library of =
equipment, it would be possible to add performance data for various =
types of boilers to the library.


For chillers, let me further clarify Kevin's comment regarding the
EIRf(PLR,dT) curve. As Kevin explained, the dT term need be developed =
only for variable-speed centrifugal chillers; it is of quite limited =
value for constant-speed centrifugals, and of extremely limited value =
for positive-displacement machines.=20

The discharge/suction temperature differential is closely associated =
with the discharge/suction pressure differential. If the cooling tower =
is controlled to a fixed, high setpoint such as 85F, then the chiller =
impeller may not be able to slow down much at all, even at low loads; =
the majority of capacity modulation will then be via the inlet vanes =
rather than speed. This is because the maximum possible pressure rise =
across the impeller drops off as the square of the impeller speed. =
Chiller impellers are typically closely matched to the design pressure =
rise specified by the engineer. If the required pressure rise does not =
drop off substantially as the load drops, then the impeller must =
maintain speed to avoid surge.

Data commonly published by manufacturers (and implicit in the IPLV) =
ASSUMES the condensing temperature drops with load; thereby allowing the =
impeller speed to drop off. That may not actually be the case in real =
life! Nor is it true in eQUEST unless you specify a low tower setpoint, =
or utilize a tower reset scheme.=20

The default EIRf(PLR,dT) curve for variable-speed centrifugals was =
developed using a manufacturer's proprietary software package that was =
loaned to us; it password-expired after a short time. To our knowledge, =
these data cannot be developed from software available to the general =
engineering community.
(You need to be able to vary the chilled-water and condensing =
temperatures independently of the part-load ratio. This is also why IPLV =
data is worthless for an hourly simulation program; the "condenser =
relief" is built into the part-load performance.) Let me know if you are =
aware of any centrifugal chiller manufacturers that make this data =
generally available.

This brings to mind another interesting point that perhaps others can =
respond to. Over the years I have heard unsubstantiated rumors that a =
multi-impeller chiller, such as a Trane, may have significantly =
different part-load performance compared to a single-impeller chiller, =
such as a Carrier. Does anybody have information regarding =
multi-impeller vs.
single-impeller part-load performance?

You are too generous Mike. I should heed my own advice on the =
documentation.
Thanks for clarifying this.

I also thought and consulted a colleague (thanks Steve) on Taylor's =
chiller
question:

For chillers, the second term in EIRf(PLR,dT) is important only for =
variable-speed centrifugal chillers. It is of negligible importance in =
other types of chillers. It is important in variable-speed, because the =
temperature differential is strongly correlated with the required speed =
of the impeller. If the dT is high enough, then the impeller may have to =
run at full speed even at low loads. The DOE-2 default curves are just =
that, defaults. Some folks find it necessary to create new curves to =
reflect their specific equipment. Cautions offered
* verify the conditions (condenser/evaprator) for efficiencies at lower =
part loads are the same as for above 50%
* make sure the points are normalized around the rating condition

Sorry for my hasty response.

which is from the cooling of the outside air. Third, I subtract the
first model's chiller cooling load by the second model's chiller cooling
load to obtain what would be the cooling load taken up by radiant
ceiling cooling panels.=20

=20

In theory, the radiant cooling panels' load would be much larger than
the outside air cooling load. However, my calculations are telling me
that the outdoor air load is larger than the radiant cooling panels'
load. Also, in the second simulation, I have reduced the amount of
supply air by 80% because only outdoor air is being supplied to the
building. Therefore, my fan power consumption should decrease by 80% as
well. My results tell me however that the fans' energy consumption has
only decreased by 10%.

=20

Would anyone know of a reason why my results don't make any sense?? The
majority of my inputs for the two simulations are the same except for
where it is necessary to vary them.=20

the Radiance Plug-in which is seemingly far more realistic? For further
information regarding this you should refer to the the www.squ1.com

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Exterior shades / daylight on floor surface -
ECOTECT


I may be expanding the forum somewhat, but, does anyone have experience
modeling exterior shades / fins to optimize day lighting using Ecotect?

=20
I am modeling some exterior shades and it seems that the impact on
internal light levels is not being reflected to the degree I would
expect.  Now I know the algorithm used uses a diffuse sky rather than
direct radiation, but still the effect of the shades does not seem to
reduce the internal light levels.  I ran a check using insolation and
direct radiation so I know the model "sees" the shades, but the daylight
is acting funny.

Thanks.

Ditto, for what it's worth!

 

I had a project with a 2-story entry/atrium space with a glass exterior in a very cold climate... actual design used a heavy amount of baseboards along the perimeter in addition to FPVAV's with reheat.

 

The baseline system serving that space was a fan-powered box (System 6) that had to autosize pretty big to keep up with the heating loads.

So the interpretation would be that we must model the baseboard system with whatever HVAC system is associated with the design while the baseline model only has to include the system type spelled out in the guidelines?

Dear Will,

 

All baseline systems have some sort of (non-baseboard) heating as part of the system.  Baseboard would only be used for a Proposed system.

Hello all,

 

I was trying to find some guidance on how we are suppose to model baseboard systems on the baseline model for LEED submission. Are they treated like preheat systems where we must simulate them to be the same on both the proposed and baseline or is there some rule I'm not seeing in ASHRAE 90.1-2007?

 

Thanks!

Message-ID: <4A015401026CF44ABCC4D2A6A467AA18CFD202@EXCHANGE1.cadd_group.ghtltd.com>

I was wondering if anyone would be willing to share thermally broken
aluminum frame conductance values that they've been using in recent
Windows5 center-of-glass calculations.  I don't have information on the
particular aluminum frames for my current project, so I don't really
want to try and learn THERM quite yet.

 

Most of the older documentation online that I've found shows that
thermally broken aluminum frames typically have a U-value of about 1.0.
This jives with one of DOE-2s window entries for a PPG glass with a
frame conductance of 0.94.

 

Almost every commercial building constructed these days is made with
aluminum framed windows...I just have a hard time believing that
manufacturers haven't figured out better ways to insulate the frames.
With vinyl and wood having U-values < 0.4, I have to think that aluminum
frames should be able to at least approach 0.5, if not lower.
Unfortunately not a lot of manufacturers of aluminum frames post their
thermal characteristics.

 

What are people using?

 

Thanks in advance!

Hi James,

As you said, Window5 does offer a default value for Thermally Broken AL (U-1.0 BTU/h?ft??F). I've seen some thermally broken frames with much worse performance (U-1.5). I'm currently looking at modeling a YKK frame right now with our glass, and the frame performance is around U-0.9.  I haven't seen anything near U-0.5.

I believe that the U-value of the frame will vary based on the glass package that it is modeled with, but I'm not sure by how much.

I know SeriousMaterials now has a fiberglass framed window that are Heavy Commercial (CW) rated - link<http://www.seriouswindows.com/commercial/products/heavy-commercial.html>. Fiberglass has comparable thermal properties to wood and vinyl - I believe these windows have as high as U-0.19 (frame+glass performance). The frame conductance is around U-0.5.

Although I think using THERM is a good approach (I just learned how using this 17 minute video by LBNL - link<http://windows.lbl.gov/software/therm/demo/Sample/index.html>) you can create a new generic frame material in WINDOW5 and assign the frame conductivity. I would say U-0.8 or 0.9 is the best you'll do with thermally broken AL and U-0.5 is where fiberglass is.

Regards,
Alex Krickx

One additional piece of information I am interested in is the handling
of Section G3.1.2.10 Exhaust Air Energy Recovery. In the actual design a
10,000 CFM ERV will be serving all the corridor spaces (9 in total).
This unit will be 100% OA with energy recovery.

 

Section G3.1.2.10 states that systems over 5,000 CFM require modeling
energy recovery in the baseline. So it would seem I need to model energy
recovery on the PTAC serving the corridor(s). Right? To do this I would
actually be modeling a Packaged Rooftop Unit with the efficiencies of a
PTAC because it's not easy to implement heat recovery on a PTAC in
Energyplus.

 

The one twist to this is that in the 90.1 2007 Addendum w it states:

 

G3.1.2.10 Exhaust Air Energy Recovery

...

Exceptions: If any of these exceptions apply, exhaust air

energy recovery shall not be included in the baseline

building design.

...

i. Systems serving dwelling units in multifamily buildings.

 

The corridor is not a dwelling unit, but it was worth pointing that
addendum note out.

So far as system type goes, consider that your building is first either
Residential or Nonresidential, and your building type determines your
baseline system.  

 

The only reason you'd have both building types (and thus 2  baseline
system types) is if you have non-predominant conditions per exceptions
to G3.1.1.  

 

If you've got >20,000SF of egress/back-of-house spaces, you might pursue
a second baseline system type declaring non-predominant conditions, but
for simplicity I'd be inclined to lump it all under one baseline type as
part of a residential building, unless told otherwise.

Hey, thanks for the response. I agree, I think hybrid is the way to go
in this scenario.

 

One other issue I came across, since I not as familiar modeling
residential buildings, is the way that egress areas are treated. ASHRAE
list residential spaces as only including "guest rooms, living quarters,
private living space and sleeping quarters."

 

Does this mean the residential corridors and stairs need to be System 7,
and not PTAC, since the building is greater than 5 stories?

 

Thanks again,

Hello, yes it's another Appendix G Baseline question.

 

Typical Residential Tower system with water-cooled heat pumps for the

for the winters (northeast climate). Heat injection boiler is natural
gas fired.

 

Is the Baseline "Electric and Other"? or "Fossil/Electric Hybrid"

 

I have seen many postings about WSHP being modeled as "all electric"
heating, but I am getting push back on this in the office because of the
heat injection component. Any CIRs on this one? System is obviously very
common.

I'm inclined to suggest you capitalize on that exception.  

 

>From your description, it sounds like a reasonable reviewer would agree
the proposed 100% OA ERV unit is serving ventilation air to the dwelling
units, albeit via the corridors (unless your corridors need a bunch of
ventilation air?).  

 

I think the only hangup that could make this exception not apply would
be whether your building is a "multifamily building" in 90.1's terms.

 

This exception should simplify your baseline and, provided ERV makes
sense for your proposed case and is well-designed, should better your
relative performance.

PTAC because it's not easy to implement heat recovery on a PTAC in
Energyplus.

 

The one twist to this is that in the 90.1 2007 Addendum w it states:

 

G3.1.2.10 Exhaust Air Energy Recovery

...

Exceptions: If any of these exceptions apply, exhaust air

energy recovery shall not be included in the baseline

building design.

...

i. Systems serving dwelling units in multifamily buildings.

 

The corridor is not a dwelling unit, but it was worth pointing that
addendum note out.

Nick,

 

Yes, it is well below 20,000 ft2 so I believe you are correct. Thanks
for the help. I will proceed under the residential building system type.

So far as system type goes, consider that your building is first either
Residential or Nonresidential, and your building type determines your
baseline system.  

 

The only reason you'd have both building types (and thus 2  baseline
system types) is if you have non-predominant conditions per exceptions
to G3.1.1.  

 

If you've got >20,000SF of egress/back-of-house spaces, you might pursue
a second baseline system type declaring non-predominant conditions, but
for simplicity I'd be inclined to lump it all under one baseline type as
part of a residential building, unless told otherwise.

Hey, thanks for the response. I agree, I think hybrid is the way to go
in this scenario.

 

One other issue I came across, since I not as familiar modeling
residential buildings, is the way that egress areas are treated. ASHRAE
list residential spaces as only including "guest rooms, living quarters,
private living space and sleeping quarters."

 

Does this mean the residential corridors and stairs need to be System 7,
and not PTAC, since the building is greater than 5 stories?

 

Thanks again,

Hi Jason,

 

I will choose Fossil/Elec. Hybrid and PTAC for your design.

Hello, yes it's another Appendix G Baseline question.

 

Typical Residential Tower system with water-cooled heat pumps for the
dwelling units. Tower Loop is closed system with a heat injection boiler
for the winters (northeast climate). Heat injection boiler is natural
gas fired.

 

Is the Baseline "Electric and Other"? or "Fossil/Electric Hybrid"

 

I have seen many postings about WSHP being modeled as "all electric"
heating, but I am getting push back on this in the office because of the
heat injection component. Any CIRs on this one? System is obviously very
common.

On the eQUEST-side, my understanding has been that coupling energy recovery
with the dummy dedicated outdoor air unit creates indigestion in the
functioning of the DOAS. Anyone have similar experiences,
or ulterior insights?

Message-ID: <7F375B16C5455542AC9B6247C74FDB8602B68D@grpandmbx01.mail.erm55.com>

Hello all,

I am attempting to model horizontal blind controls in eQuest / DOE2 in conjunction with daylight dimming controls for lighting in a high rise office tower using eQuest 3.64.

In the past I have generally modelled windows using simplified glass type definitions or import from WINDOW 5, but this time around I'm using the window layers commands as this allows controlled horizontal blinds to be simulated (at least in theory).  The blind control system is controlled by a sun tracking system located on the roof of the building. The designer has supplied me with detailed scheduled hourly schedules of the blind slat angle per fa?ade orientation.

My understanding of the blind control capability in eQuest/ DOE2 is that blinds can be controlled using a SCHEDULE(s) of the type FRACTION for the window coverage and slat angle respectively. As such, I have developed two schedules, 1) for lowering and raising of the blinds [ window coverage] and 2) blind slat angle adjustment.



My problem is I'm getting an error (typical eQuest nonsense) stating


BDL error: Error in blind control: Adjustment type SCHEDULE for BLIND should be SCHEDULE


I don't see what the error is.  I have pasted the BDL below

    *1142 * "Window 71" = WINDOW
     *1143 *    GLASS-TYPE       = "GL7"
     *1144 *    WIN-SPEC-METHOD  = LAYERS-INPUT

The DOE2 documentation is sparse on this subject and I'm basically chasing my tail on this. If anyone out there has successfully modelled blind controls and has suggestions or has an alternative way of modelling automatic horizontal blinds with daylight light control dimming, I would be very grateful.

Hi Shuichi,

I have not actively used this area of eQUEST, but I can pretty much
guarantee that there will not be a schedule ever in eQUEST that is just
called "SCHEDULE". The reason for that is that there are just too many
schedules in eQUEST for any one of them to claim the glorified name of
"SCHEDULE". That coupled with the fact that schedules are also, of
necessity, split into DAY-SCHEDULE, WEEK-SCHEDULE, AND ANNUAL-SCHEDULE, you
can see that when you find yourself typing simply "SCHEDULE" after your
command an alarm should go off in your head that says something like "Oh,
oh, I'm putting some nonsense into eQUEST that may cause the program to go
off in some sort of GI/GO loop, I guess I'd better research the topic a bit
more."

You sound like a user of some experience so I will just encourage you to dig
a little deeper, keeping in mind the schedule structure in eQUEST and the
use of the Building Description Language.

Cheers,

Carol

That depends on what you're trying to do with the air Shambav. If you 
are meeting outdoor air requirements to maintain Indoor air quality then 
refer to ASHRAE 62.1. If you are attempting to condition the space (heat 
or cool) with the air then volume flow

     V = Q / rho.Cp.deltaT

where Q = Heating / Cooling rate, Rho = density of air, Cp = specific 
heat, DeltaT = difference in room air temperature and off coil.

A VAV system does both of these (supplies outdoor air and room 
conditioning) and uses a mixing box.

If you want to understand VAV get hold of LearnHVAC 
<http://www.learnhvac.org/index.php>.

Funny how this has expanded from the original question: "what is the range
for supply air cfm/sqft for conditioned spaces". I took it to be him asking
for OA+RA quantities that get delivered to a space, since I was just talking
about that with a colleague recently. Perhaps Sambhav can let us know if we
met his needs.

Thank you once again, Varkie, for sending us another of you papers. I
appreciate all information I get from you and I actually read it!! Good
stuff.

Cheers,

Carol

Registration is limited - register by March 21st!


Tools, DOE Roadmap, BEMP Certification Featured at ASHRAE's Energy Modeling Conference April 4-6



ASHRAE's Energy Modeling Conference: Tools for Designing High Performance Buildings, April 4-6, 2011, ASHRAE Headquarters, Atlanta, Ga., will provide hands-on modelers and principals with the information to better harness the power of energy modeling tools.

The strength of the conference is its focus on different software tools. The conference addresses:

* How things get modeled and the impact of input data on energy models;

* What the strengths are of different software products in modeling specific applications;
* A comparison on how different tools address specific systems and

* Demonstrations, offered in a group session and individually by vendor sponsors, of software tools

Some of the software tools to be presented include ArchiCAD, Apache, Autodesk, Bentley, Ecotect, EnergyPlus, EPGUI, eQuest, Graphisoft, IES Virtual Environment, OpenStudio, Revit, Trane TRACE  and TRNSYS.


Keynote speakers are Lynn G. Bellenger, P.E., ASHRAE president and William J. Worthen, American Institute of Architecture's (AIA) national director and resource architect for sustainability.

In addition, on April 6, the U.S. Department of Energy is launching its development roadmap for EnergyPlus, OpenStudio, EPGUI and other tools. See proposed changes and provide feedback on the roadmap and on DOE's general activities in the simulation tools area.
Registration is $500 ($450, ASHRAE, AIA and USGBC members). Seating is limited - register today! Advance registration closes March 21.

Carol,
You are right.  The question was what is the range for supply air in CFM/sqft.  SA standards for medical and industrial facilities are in ACH.  The minimum value for OA & SA are set by standards but the maximum SA value cannot be anything that CFM = BTUH (cooling) / (1.08 * (Ti - Ts)) produces.  The type of space determines the maximum and there is a limit to the SA and after which other cheaper methods (supplying air is expensive) are used for heating and cooling and judgement is also involved.  It helps to understand the whole subject.  Refer to OSHA for the answer to the question.  http://www.osha.gov/

Subject: [Bldg-sim] How to model water to water HP for MAU in EE4
Message-ID: <4016B1EA0C8DA84D88D1E20A29CD3E792869FD99C2@TOR-SVR-EX5.mcw.com>


Hello
We got a condo project, with water to water HP providing cooling and heating  for central make up air unit, and hot water from boiler and a second heat resource for this make up unit.
At zone level, there is ERV providing fresh air to suites. And the HPs in suites provide additional heating and cooling.
In EE4 there is no option to set water to water HP for make up unit. So we are thinking three options

1.       Put heating capacity of MAU to zone, and break down all the heating from water to water HP and boiler to zone level, combined with HP in suites

2.       Put boiler as predominate heating resource for MAU, and break down water to water HP to zone level with HPs in suites. Then the setting of supply air temperature would be very tricky.

3.       Add up total capacity of boiler and water to water HP as one hot water heat source. This option ignores the HP heating
Which one option is more reasonable? Or there is other better way to model this system?
Thank you,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Building Controls Virtual Test Bed 1.0 has been released
Message-ID: <AANLkTinw2wYNWp=oNu9dwRdLWOMd1rYdAuHnr4v0HCSb@mail.gmail.com>

We are pleased to announce the release of the Building Controls Virtual Test
Bed 1.0

The Building Controls Virtual Test Bed (BCVTB) is a freely available
open-source software environment that allows expert users to couple
different simulation programs for co-simulation, and to couple simulation
programs with actual hardware. For example, the BCVTB allows to simulate a
building in EnergyPlus and the HVAC and control system in Modelica, while
exchanging data between the software as they simulate. The BCVTB is based on
the Ptolemy II software environment. The BCVTB allows expert users of
simulation to expand the capabilities of individual programs by linking them
to other programs. Due to the different programs that may be involved in
distributed simulation, familiarity with configuring programs is essential.

Programs that are linked to the BCVTB are
 * the EnergyPlus whole building energy simulation program,
 * the Modelica modeling and simulation environment Dymola,
 * the MATLAB and Simulink tools for scientific computing,
 * the Radiance ray-tracing software for lighting analysis,
 * the BACnet stack, which allows exchanging data with BACnet compliant
Building Automation System (BAS),
 * the analog/digital interface USB-1208LS from Measurement Computing
Corporation that can be connected to a USB port.

In addition to using programs that are coupled to Ptolemy II, Ptolemy II's
graphical modeling environment can also be used to define models for control
systems, for physical devices, for communication systems or for
post-processing and real-time visualization.

Hi Sandeep,

A full list of the available output variables are given in the .rdd file (it
is one of the files output from the simulation). Simply copy the relevant
line from that file into your .idf (or .imf) file, rerun the simulation, and
the new variable(s) will be output to the .csv and .eso files.

e.g. Adding this line to the input file  will give you the convective heat
gain from all interior surfaces in your model.
Output:Variable,*,Surface Int Convection Heat Rate,hourly; !- Zone Average
[W]

Regards,
Paul

Sandeep,

This is what I call a legacy topic from the DOE2 era. You better search 
the posts in EnergyPlus support mailing list. Search for "cooling load 
component", and you will find an interesting discussion.

In summary, you will not find a cooling load component report in 
EnergyPlus nicely formatted a-la LS-C report in eQuest/DOE2.

If you try to match the total gains v.s. the cooling load for every time 
step, then you will be in for a long ride. Take the solar radiation 
gain, for example. The GAIN for a particular time step is not 
necessarily converted into cooling LOAD at the next time step. If your 
building is thermally massive, then the delay plays an important role 
and it could be hours before the solar radiation GAIN becomes an actual 
LOAD as seen by the thermostat. Do not forget about this, if you try to 
match the cooling load report with the total gains.

If you are talking about peak cooling load, then you will need to focus 
on the zone sizing report. Calculating the gains component is easy 
because the schedule is always 100% on. You just need to quantify the 
ventilation load.

Please note that the report suggested by Paul below is the convection 
report. I imagine that you would expect a conduction report? EnergyPlus 
zones technically cannot see conduction through opaque surfaces, in the 
sense of A*U*DeltaT. They can only see convection and radiation. In 
fact, if you try to match A*U*DeltaT for external wall with this report 
(Surface Int Convection Heat Rate) then you will have a hard time 
explaining. If you keep this in mind, the differences can be easily 
explained.

Cheeers,

Ery

Thank you; 
I am running the example file Supermarket_Detailed which has a 50m x 50m supermarket but the Electricity:HVAC [J](Monthly) for July in Tampa weather is 1.3 ? 10 9 . 
	
To convert this into Kwh I multiplied it by 2.7778 ? 10 ?7 which gives 363Kwh only . I think it should be around 100 times this amount. Am I doing something wrong? 
Thank you for any help

Hi Ery,

Thanks for this explanation.  I have been struggling with this topic as well
as I do more modeling in Energy Plus.  However, there is one thing that you
did not address above.  While DOE2's LS-C report may not match exactly to
what systems are seeing as far as loads, it does give an easily readable
report which allows you to check your inputs.  I review it quite often as a
quality control check for my models.  It also allows me to target energy
saving measures, and helps me explain to clients why certain changes might
make sense for their building.  For example, one client might be interested
in increasing roof insulation, but if they have a multi-story building with
a relatively small roof, and lots of wall area, it makes more sense for them
to reduce thermal bridging in their wall construction.  Having a
model-generated report makes this process much faster for me.

Do you have any suggestions with regards to Energy Plus of ways to achieve
the above goals with the currently available reports?

Thanks.

Hi Karen,
Same here, I always use LS-C when I use eQuest. Just adding the 
ventilaton load, then you will have the peak load. Its always fun to 
compare this number with what the mechanical engineer has.
I said earlier, in EnergyPlus it is not nicely formated like LS-C. It 
does not mean you cannot have it. You can force EPlus to show the 
numbers. The internal gains are the easy ones, the windows are also 
relatively easy, the last pieces are the opaque "conduction" and the 
ventilation load. Which is not difficult.

The problem is what peak to report? You will have the peak of the total 
gains, which will happen at a different timestep then the peak of the 
cooling load. And these two, in turn is different with the zone sizing 
report.

I personally use the zone sizing reports as the peak loads, and I will 
get all the details by running the designday run with schedules 
consistent with the design day schedule.

Hope this helps,

Ery

Thanks Ery.

It helps.  It's just slow.  What I love about LS-C is that it's fast.  Do
you know of a way to get a grouped report for all walls within a particular
zone.  So instead of having hourly output for every wall in a space, you
would have one for each: exterior walls, interior walls, etc?  This would
make reviewing these outputs much faster!

Thanks!

Karen

Nope, not that I know of. Before this kind of summaries is implemented 
in EPlus, I think scripting is the way to get faster results. SQLite is 
really a powerful result analysis tool. What you describe below can be 
implemented relatively easily with some SQL statements.

We have been trying to come up with a better way to communicate this 
kind of output to the client. I will share the results to this list once 
we finalize how to do this in EPlus.

Thanks,

Ery

Hi Ery

I appreciate your suggistions. So its clear that we can't get the complete
break-up of coolong load in EnergyPus in terms of energy (joules), but we
can get the components of peak load in Watts.

You mentioned, "You can force EPlus to show the numbers... the last pieces
are the opaque "conduction" and the ventilation load. Which is not difficult".
Can you please elaborate, how?

Thanks
Sandeep Kachhawa

Hi all,

Does anyone know if there's any public benchmark data of the the energy use for sports facilities (in US or other countries)?

I checked the CBECS database as well as the benchmark E+ models, but apparently sports facilities is not one of the building types they selected. If there's no such benchmark data available online, some literature that have surveyed data would also help me tremendously.

Thank you very much.

FYI:

You'll find some dated, but useful information in the following ASHRAE papers, which talk about work in the 1980s on a Rec Center at the University of Colorado in Boulder:

Haberl, J., Claridge, D. 1987. ?An Expert System for Building Energy Consumption Analysis: Prototype Results,? ASHRAE Transactions-Research, Vol. 93, Pt. 1, pp. 979 - 998 (January). 

Haberl, J., Claridge, D. 1985. ?Retrofit Energy Studies of a Recreation Center,? ASHRAE Transactions-Research, Vol. 91, Pt. 2, pp. 1421 - 1433 (June). 

There is also a slug of reports and papers that document about 10 yrs of work on the Rec Center, which you can pluck out of my on-line resume at the Lab --> www.esl.tamu.edu., one of which was a DOE-2 simulation of the Rec Center that included the ice rink and swimming pool (as best we could)....if enough folks bug me I'll get them loaded into the digital library at TAMU.

We also have sub-metered data on the Rec Center at TAMU, and several models as well...

In general, Rec Centers are about as complex as you can imagine, especially if they have a pool, perhaps a Poolpac system, heat reclaim, ice rink, etc., etc. For the Rec Center at CU, we eventually developed an expert system that predicted what was wrong and saved them lots of money on day to day mistakes...this is the topic of the 1987 paper.

I seem to recall there was a DOE publication about Rec Centers as well, but I can't seem to recall the citation off the top of my head.

If this print utility is as an aide to model quality checking one 
pattern to follow is that used by the ESP-r simulation suite 
for its model contents report.  It decodes most of the data 
in the model files into a quazi-human-readable
form with various derived attributes added.  

We find that such model contents documents, which are 
designed for QA staff, are a good way of detecting patterns 
in descriptive information which is difficult, if not impossible, 
to detect on a computer monitor.  Just printing
the literal contents of an IDF file does not necessarily 
help - it is formatted for machine reading and does not 
join together distributed information that
eyes are good at making sense of. 

And model QA reports, if generated at different stages 
of a model evolution, are great for visual difference 
checks about 'what has changed' and 'what is still left to do'.

Indeed, Lind Lawrie and I discussed the need for an 
alternative QA process for EnergyPlus models - if you check 
IDF files regularly there seems to be a correlation with grey 
hair.

And to balance out this QA report there is a chapter in the
ESP-r Cookbookthat gives guidance on how to interpret 
the contents of the report and what key words to look for
and patterns to look for and stages when reports are
particularly useful.  

The model report is rather large for inclusion in a Bldg-sim 
email but if anyone is interested I would be happy to 
forward some typical reports and the documentation that 
supports its use.

Hello All,

I am trying to model a three floor office building for LEED V3. The first
and second floor are served by two chilled water air handlers, both
manifolded and running in parallel.
Does LEED require to model both the units because the schedules and drawings
show two units.
For baseline, I know ASHRAE G3.1.1 states I have to have seperate HVAC

You only model them as they are supposed to run (one at a time or both at
the same time). 

 

You mention they run in parallel, so I assume that the capacity of both may
be required at peak load.  If they operated lead/lag, then you would only
model one (or half AHU capacity per floor).

Jim and all,

The DOE reference building models were developed as standard energy simulation models that represent typical building practices.  The energy models were developed to form consistent starting points for energy modeling exercises such as evaluating energy standards (they have been used for 90.1 and 189.1) and evaluating new technologies.  They are not meant to represent actual energy use of any particular building; however, the results from the models could be used as another reference point for comparing energy performance if the model is close to your building type.

Dear Michael,

Thanks for your reply. 

I understand that the main purpose of these benchmark models is to provide 
consistency in modeling methods and implementation in commercial buildings. 
There is another report from NREL "methodology for modeling building energy 
performance across the commercial sector":
http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy08osti/41956.pdf
I am not sure whether there is  a direct connection between this report and 
these reference building models.  But as said in this report,
"For routine or widespread use, we recommend developing smaller sets of 
benchmark models to represent the commercial sector." So I think it is 
reasonable to compare the results of thsese reference models to actual typical 
energy use in different types of commercial buildings although more variations 
of these models need to be created to represent wide range of actual buildings. 
Whether they match well or not,  it may give some clue how the buildings across 
the commercial sector perform as a whole in practise.  Anyway, the results from 
these kind of bottom up methods are usually very hard to be consistent with each 
other.

Message-ID: <AANLkTinKCzePKLe4sArTJba2zU0OdUBwtFYkQ-mPJd0m@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Can any one throw some light on effect of change in thermostat set-point on
energy consumption. There is one research paper by Jin Woo Moon & Seung-Hoon
Han named "Thermostat strategies impact on energy consumption in residential
buildings", which shows the amount of heating and cooling energy for
different set-point temperature.

Does any one knows about any other similar kind of studies. We are trying
to-

1.Check, what is the base line for energy consumption at different
set-points. and
2.Cross-check, that which of our two models (one is Equest and other in E+,
which are consistent in all important inputs) is giving comparable results
with similar research studies done hitherto.

Looking forward for your valuable insight.

Thanks & regards,
Vaibhav

It is more useful/interesting, if anyone share % energy saving for

The reason I am confused is that they use X in other places.

Yes that is correct. 

 

Constant Volume Systems (3-4): (CFMS X 0.00094) + A

Variable Volume Systems (5-8): (CFMS X 0.0013) + A

Does the dot in the equation indicate multiplication? So should the equation read CFMS X 0.0013 + A?

 

The reason I am confused is that they use X in other places.

yes.  the dot means multiplication.  it would also be nice if ashrae 
used parenthesis more, but they don't for some reason.

Hi Vaibhav,

 

I'd like to offer a few cautions:

 

"All important inputs" implies there is a category of inputs which are
"not important" in both eQuest and E+.  I don't take any issue with the
notion, but unless your building(s) involve systems striking at either
engine's fundamental limitations, any major differences in your models'
reported behavior almost assuredly stems from such inputs that you have
not made consistent (i.e. the defaults).

 

You might want to re-characterize your query as trying to:

1. First, determine which set of "not important" defaults (eQuest or E+)
is doing a better job of matching existing research applicable to your
project.  Then,

2. Determine the effects of varying thermostat setpoints.

 

If that's correct, then you should be describing your modeled
building(s) further to find appropriate research to reference/validate.
If it's a series of residential homes, it won't help you much to find
research exploring thermostat settings for industrial manufacturing
facilities, for example.

 

It would probably also be worthwhile to specify whether you're looking
for thermostat research based on "real-world" measurements/data and/or
based on predictive models, based on your personal intents.

 

~Nick

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Impact of change in Thermostat Set-point on
energyconsumption

 

Hello,

 

Can any one throw some light on effect of change in thermostat set-point
on energy consumption. There is one research paper by Jin Woo Moon &
Seung-Hoon Han named "Thermostat strategies impact on energy consumption
in residential buildings", which shows the amount of heating and cooling
energy for different set-point temperature. 

 

Does any one knows about any other similar kind of studies. We are
trying to-

 

1.Check, what is the base line for energy consumption at different
set-points. and

2.Cross-check, that which of our two models (one is Equest and other in
E+, which are consistent in all important inputs) is giving comparable
results with similar research studies done hitherto. 

 

Looking forward for your valuable insight.

 

Thanks & regards,

Vaibhav

Actually the calculator has both the 2004 and the 2007 in separate tabs.

Keep in mind that calculator is only for 90.1-2004.  Calculations have
changed substantially for 90.1-2007.  Less restrictive for larger systems,
more restrictive for smaller systems.

Yes that is correct, the dot means multiplication.

Does the dot in the equation indicate multiplication? So should the equation
read CFMS X 0.0013 + A?

 

The reason I am confused is that they use X in other places.

Very nifty - don't know if anyone was curious, but this checks out
against the math in my personal spreadsheet.  

 

Out of pure curiosity, does anybody else combine their baseline system
efficiency calcs (i.e. EIR) alongside their fan power calcs, or is it
normal to submit that separately... or not at all?

A word of caution if you are using this 2007 tab of this spreadsheet. The pressure credit is being calculated for the entire supply fan cfm. It should only be calculated for the design airflow through the device. While these two airflows can be the same, often they are not.

answer:  yes.

typically i submit the wizard input screens showing the input 
efficiencies for packaged units & don't submit the eir unless asked.  
most reviewers who are familiar with equest realize that equest will 
break out fan energy when calculating eir.  on central plant systems i 
will show it for the chiller(s) along w/the fan power calculations as 
there isn't a chiller input in the wizard mode.

Thanks Dear Bereket,

First, actively we are associated with EnergyPlus only but due to unexpected
% energy saving (cooling only and heating is off throughout year) for
consecutive set point (22 to 23C), I prepared a model in eQUEST with same
input parameters including envelope, HVAC, schedule  etc and I observed that
both tools shows large difference in % energy savings (8 to 10%). Is it
possible to shows this much amount of energy saving?

Second, this is clear to me that both tools uses different engine so results
could not be matched exactly. I hope there should be some nominal
differences in outputs.
Meanwhile I would like to ask one more question-

IS it possible to have difference in cooling energy consumption for *a
building *using E+ and eQUEST when building parameters were given exactly
same in both tools and
if difference is possible then which software shall be reliable to client
assurance?.



*Regards.*
Shivraj Dhaka

Here's my attempt at doing that - let me know if this makes sense.

Basically what I've done is separate out the supply fan energy and the condenser and compressor energy to give you an EER (and EIR for eQUEST) for just the cooling side.

Very nifty - don't know if anyone was curious, but this checks out against the math in my personal spreadsheet.

Out of pure curiosity, does anybody else combine their baseline system efficiency calcs (i.e. EIR) alongside their fan power calcs, or is it normal to submit that separately... or not at all?

Keep in mind that calculator is only for 90.1-2004.  Calculations have changed substantially for 90.1-2007.  Less restrictive for larger systems, more restrictive for smaller systems.

Does the dot in the equation indicate multiplication? So should the equation read CFMS X 0.0013 + A?

The reason I am confused is that they use X in other places.

A word of caution if you are using this 2007 tab of this spreadsheet.
The pressure credit is being calculated for the entire supply fan cfm.
It should only be calculated for the design airflow through the device.
While these two airflows can be the same, often they are not.

G3.1.2.10.1 The calculated system fan power shall be

This is a good question and isn't specifically addressed in Appendix G 2007.  It does specify to match the proposed design's fan arrangement so this can be used as a starting point.  On a recent job we did with return fans, the overall fan power was split 70/30 between supply and return.  Another job that used power exhaust fans split out to 80/20.  As Michael mentioned, Appendix G 2010 says that they should be proportioned out the same as the proposed design although that information often needs to be extracted from the design team.

I understand HSPF is fundamentally the same thing as SEER, only it's
representing a heating season instead of a cooling season.

 

When handling SEER, I used the following equation to come up with a
seasonally averaged cooling EER:

 

EER = SEER * 0.875

 

My limited understanding is that 0.875 is a conceptually a constant
representing a "part load cycling factor" of sorts for a typical cooling
season.  I've read multiple times this constant should vary with climate
(commonly, "Georgia = 0.8" and "California = 0.9").  While that makes
sense to me, I've yet to see a citable climate map or similar reference
breaking down what factor to use where... so up to this point I've stuck
with 0.875 for simplicity's sake.

 

My root question is:  Is there a comparable "part load cycling factor,"
for one or more climates, for converting HSPF to a seasonally averaged
heating COP/EER?

 

Put another way:  EER = HSPF * ???

Nick,

The relationship between SEER and EER is going to vary from system to system and does not depend on the climate. Take a look at the AHRI certified product database:

http://www.ahridirectory.org/ahridirectory/pages/home.aspx

They report both SEER and EER for all air conditioners and heat pumps that have been tested. There is no way to convert directly between SEER and EER (or HSPF and COP) without having the results from the all of the AHRI tests which are usually kept confidential. The approximation of 0.875 accounts for part load cycling losses, but also how the system performs at other test conditions. It is probably a fair assumption, though you might want to check out the Building America House Simulation Protocol which uses:

EER = -0.02*SEER^2 + 1.12*SEER

This is based on a thesis written by a student at University of Colorado. The same thesis used:

COP_47 = -0.026*HSPF^2 + 0.624*HSPF


Here is the reference for the thesis:

Wassmer, M. (2003). A Component-Based Model for Residential Air Conditioner and Heat Pump Energy Calculations. Masters Thesis, University of Colorado at Boulder.

Hope this helps,

Neal,

 

Thanks very much - this is very helpful and rounds out my understanding much better!

 

Regarding climate, I probably wasn't clear in my intent - I meant that the 0.875 "factor," if correctly understood to account for (among other things) the amount a unit can be expected to cycle during a cooling season, might also vary based on climate.  The idea here being that the same condensing unit will cycle on more in Florida than in Maine for the same cooling season.  If the goal is to come up with a "seasonally averaged EER," then perhaps varying that factor could do the trick?

 

Some extra google-searching has led me to this article coming out of UCF:

http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/publications/html/FSEC-PF-413-04/

 

In particular, check out this interesting climate map presented as part of the conclusions showing how location-specific SEER/HSPF efficiencies can vary from ARI ratings:  http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/publications/html/FSEC-PF-413-04/images/Figure5_lg.gif

 

It sounds for the moment like the SEER/HSPF -> EER formulae you've shared below might be what I'm looking for - for my part, I'll see whether I can look up that student's paper =).

 

***

 

PS: I've only picked up this [EER = 0.875 * SEER] equation from popular hear-say... After some digging I've found what looks like a plausible explanation of its source here:  http://www.udarrell.com/airconditioning_eer_ratings_over_seer_ratings_central_systems.html

"The SEER of a system is determined by multiplying the steady state energy efficiency ratio (EER) measured at conditions of 82?F outdoor temperature, 80?F dB/ 67?F wb 50% RH indoor entering air temperature by the "Part Load Factor" (PLF) of the system. 
The PLF is a measure of the cyclic performance (CD) of a system and is calculated as follows: CD is Cyclical Data
PLF    = 1.00 -  (CD X's 0.5)

"The cyclic performance (CD) value in the above equation has been determined by the government to be 0.25." The government contends that the PLF should equal:  
[1.00  -  (.25 x .5)] = .125 
1.00 - .125 = 0.875, which yields: PLF  of 0.875"

 

The same fellow goes on to cite California provides the formula [SEER = EER / 0.90] (is this a Title 24 thing?), and that for Georgia a value of 0.80 might be a better approximation constant considering the climate.

 

*** 

 

Thanks again so much!

 

~Nick

In that case ? for the baseline the Fan power limitation ? is for the ENTIRE
building ? supply and return. You calculate your total allowable and then
break it down based on the ratio in your designed building. Sop for example
if your designed building has a supply to return fan energy ratio of 3:1, you
would first calculate your total allowable fan energy, and then separate it
by supply and return in the ratio of 4:1.

 

There?s been some extensive discussion on this topic in the past on this list
? you could probably find it in the archives somewhere.

This is a good question and isn?t specifically addressed in Appendix G 2007.
It does specify to match the proposed design?s fan arrangement so this can be
used as a starting point.  On a recent job we did with return fans, the
overall fan power was split 70/30 between supply and return.  Another job
that used power exhaust fans split out to 80/20.  As Michael mentioned,
Appendix G 2010 says that they should be proportioned out the same as the
proposed design although that information often needs to be extracted from
the design team.

From time to time we?re asked in LEED-Clarifications to break up the total

The calculation in the proposed is totally different and for the baseline we

Does the dot in the equation indicate multiplication? So should the equation

The reason I am confused is that they use X in other places.

Sorry, this isn't a modeling question, but I think some people here could
answer this question.

I have a geothermal well field serving heat pumps.  Is there any convention
on labeling the pipes?

Condenser water supply / return => CWS / CWR
Ground water supply / return => GWS / GWR

I know I can make up anything I want, but I didn't know if something is
starting to become the standard.

(Something like HWS / HWR)

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Fan Power calculations in ASHRAE User Manual
Message-ID: <20110313094837.GA80806@mail19h.g19.rapidsite.net>

Recently Fan power calculations topic have discussed. I have a question
regarding the breaking power in to components.

 

According to Section G3.1.2.1 requires that ??where efficiency ratings, such
as EER and COP, include fan energy, the descriptor shall be broken down into
its components so that supply fan energy can be modeled separately.??

Since the efficiency ratings are calculated at ARI?\rated conditions, the
fans should also be broken out at ARI?\rated conditions.

 

Kindly guide me where can I find calculations in ASHRAE 90.1-2004 User??s
Manual showing that the calculation has been performed at ARI rated
conditions or any other reference.

 

Regards,

Ashraf

Hi Ashraf,

I'm not sure about 2004, but the 2007 users manual includes an example showing how to "back out" fan energy from a fan-inclusive efficiency rating.

I will be sharing a guide of sorts in the near future touching on this topic, with eQuest/DOE2 procedures defined explicitly.  Keep your eyes open for that! 

For now, let me offer an extra caution to your assertion regarding "fan power should be broken out at ARI conditions:" in the case of proposed systems, I'd agree that fan power entered may be entered as calculated (or ideally, documented) at ARI testing conditions.  In the case of baseline systems however, 90.1 is very explicit in setting a procedure independent of the prescribed efficiency to determine fan power for the system.  I'm pretty sure that calculated quantity (Pfan) takes precedence.

Nick, 

I don't see contradictions in fan-related baseline system requirements in App G. Procedure for determining baseline system parameters involves two steps:

Step 1: Determine COOLING-EIR of baseline system following the equation in the attached document, which is based on physical meaning and definition of rated EER. EER for the calculation must be taken from Table 6.8.1A based on the size and type of baseline system. Result of the calculation is entered as cooling EIR on Unitary Power tab in detailed mode. This step is independent of baseline fan power requirements in Appendix G, and captures inherent efficiency of the system at ARI conditions. 
 
Step 2: Determine fan power of the baseline system based on G3.1.2.9. Examples G-J and G-K in 90.1 User Manual is a good reference for that. Result is then entered on Fan Power and Control tab in Detailed Mode as Design kW/cfm.   

For the proposed system, equipment efficiency and fan power may be calculated based on Example G-G in the User Manual. 

Does anyone have different perspective on that?  

Thanks,   

Maria

Yes, manufacturing equipment must be included in process load.  Using
G2.5 you can submit exceptional calculations showing process load
reduction to claim savings there.

Hi Brian,

 

I think this question is easier to answer for LEED 2009 than v1.0.  In
short, yes.  Since all energy used in the building has to be accounted
for, I think it's pretty clear that this should include even minimally
heated mechanical spaces.

* Please check the simulation software documentation before 
posting.

* Please check the mailing list archive before posting.

* On eQUEST-users when asking about specific issues is often 
helpful to attach a ZIP compressed file containing the INP 
and PD2 files.

* Announcements of building simulation products or building 
performance rating methods are welcome and encouraged on the 
mailing lists. These are restricted to your choice of a 
single onebuilding.org mailing list and no more often than 
once per month.

* Do not try to sell any other products on any of the 
mailing lists (no spam is tolerated).

* Job announcements are welcome on the mailing lists but are 
restricted to one posting per month on your choice of a 
single onebuilding.org mailing list. The subject line must 
start with the words HELP WANTED. Announcements must be for 
a specific jobs available at time of posting.

* Specific training classes may be announced but are 
restricted to three postings per class on your choice of one 
onebuilding.org mailing list. The subject line must start 
with the word TRAINING.

* New sources of weather data may be announced but are 
restricted to two postings per year on your choice of one 
onebuilding.org mailing list. The subject line must start 
with the word WEATHER.

* If you are fully answering a question but also provide fee 
based support for future questions, you may include a single 
line in your signature block explaining services offered.

* No other services may be offered on the mailing lists.

* No resumes or help-available or looking-for-work postings 
are allowed on the mailing lists.

* If your question is on a specific building energy 
simulaton program that already has a onebuilding.org mailing 
list, please post to your questions to that mailing list 
first. If no answer is received within a few days, posting 
to BLDG-SIM on the same topic is welcome.

* Do not post the same message on multiple mailing lists 
within 24 hours.

* Do not attach copywritten materials without the permission 
of the copywrite owner although short quotes are welcome.

* And remember ... be courteous.

The owner of this list may remove anyone from the list that 
violates these rules.

Hi,I am looking for some feedback on thermal mass optimization for passive solar in DesignBuilder/ EnergyPlus.
I attempted a basic sensitivity analysis for thermal mass optimization for a very basic passive solar design (one south facing window, lots of insulation, all assemblies with interior concrete thermal mass). I modelled this concept using DesignBuilder with various concrete thicknesses (5cm to 50cm) but keeping the envelope U value, and all other parameters constant. I used the CTF algorithm. The annual simulation results indicate that increasing thermal mass past 20cm continues to decrease heating energy consumption, in a somewhat linear fashion. Even more unusual, was that the savings from going with 30cm compared to 20, was much greater than that achieved by the change from 10cm to 20cm. 
This does not match with the literature I have read, which suggest that this relationship should be a negative exponential decay (continuous diminishing energy savings with each added thickness). Many guidelines suggest that savings plateau at 20cm of thermal mass (as concrete).

Is this a problem with EnergyPlus? Or DesignBuilder? Any suggestions?

Thanks for your time,

I have used IDA ICE in a number of projects, mostly offices and public 
buildings from about 1000 to 55000 m? and found that the tool is extremely 
efficient and easy to use. The greatest concern is that it lack some of 
the more advanced HVAC models found in Energy Plus and that the larger 
models take a very long time to simulate (it took 11 h to run a yearly 
simulation with VAV and 80 thermal zones).

Hi David,

Thanks for your help. I've attached the sensitivity results for the six simulations in the excel file, which shows the trend, and the input files. Do you know of any good references for thermal mass behavior?

Thanks,
Hayes

Depends on you model, climate, many many things. Can you post your model?  I've found energyplus to be very good at mass modeling with appropriate results.  A highy insulated south facing zone in a heating climate will like a lot more mass than other models. Mass with direct solar acts very differently than other conditions.     To check designbuilder, export your model and review in detail using openstudio and text editor.

Message-ID: <4A015401026CF44ABCC4D2A6A467AA18CFD2E2@EXCHANGE1.cadd_group.ghtltd.com>

App G says that if the proposed building has return fans, the baseline
building is to be modeled with them as well, sized either at the minimum
required to ensure ventilation, or 90% of the supply volume, whichever
is greater.  And the fan power calculations show that the KW allowance
is for all supply, return, exhaust and relief fans combined.  

 

How do you generally pro-rate the fan power between supply and return
fans in the baseline model?  Ultimately it probably doesn't make too
much difference, but is there an actual ruling that tells you how to do
this?

Last time I did this, I entered 0.00 kW/CFM for the return fans, and all
of the calculated kW/CFM for the supply fans - better to keep it in one
place imho to avoid the headache of explaining it.  Just got news that
project wrapped up review with a silver rating this week =).

 

If you wanted to distribute the power regardless, I'd do it by weighting
with the airflow amounts.  Generally, I don't think it matters, so long
as you can backtrack your steps if asked to explain yourself ;).

Mike Rosenberg's section is a welcome improvement but it is still a challenging aspect.
You could be proportioning power (kW) across fans with different operation.  For example:

-          CAV exhaust fan vs. VFD driven supply & return fans

-          "Powered exhaust" fans that only operate to provide relief during economizer mode vs. normal supply fans

In some instances, applying a bit of professional judgment will get better results in terms of fan energy (kWh) and fan heat (DT and resultant heating and cooling loads).

Paul,

I think your point about "proportioning power (kW) across fans with different operation" is exactly the intent of this addition to 2010 (though perhaps I'm twisting your angle on it).  The intent of it is to provide consistency in the review process and undue penalty with regards to fan power.  Using your example, if the Proposed design uses CAV exhaust fans and VFD driven supply & return fans, then the Baseline should as well.  Some modelers (because the requirement has been unclear to date) put all of the fan kW on the Supply fan for the Baseline, which would skew the results so as to under-account for the Baseline energy/cost.    Others may actually game the system and place the bulk of the allowable kW on the CAV fan and not the Baseline's SA and RA fans.  It can go either way so I think this new clarity is helpful.

I wasn't sure about the last part of your comment but assumed you were referring to "professional judgment" when selecting fans in the design process.  Did I miss an important modeling insight?

Paul

Paul,
Kudos to those who are improving the fan, system, and lab aspects in 90.1.   And the intent of the specific section below is good, logical, and apparently needed if some modelers are putting all of the baseline power on the supply fan.

However, given all of the all of the possible model complexities, it is still not does not preclude the need for judgment.  As one example, several clauses in G3.1.1 can cause a deviation from a one-to-one relationship between baseline and proposed systems.  So the section cannot state " same proportion as the proposed system design."   And I highly doubt the intent is "same proportion as the aggregate of all the systems in the proposed design".  So it is somewhere in between and hence the modeler needs to apply some judgment.

If reviewers really care about this, then I suggest requiring separate documentation of the power and energy of the supply, return, relief, and exhaust for the building or even for each proposed and baseline system.

Paul,

I think your point about "proportioning power (kW) across fans with different operation" is exactly the intent of this addition to 2010 (though perhaps I'm twisting your angle on it).  The intent of it is to provide consistency in the review process and undue penalty with regards to fan power.  Using your example, if the Proposed design uses CAV exhaust fans and VFD driven supply & return fans, then the Baseline should as well.  Some modelers (because the requirement has been unclear to date) put all of the fan kW on the Supply fan for the Baseline, which would skew the results so as to under-account for the Baseline energy/cost.    Others may actually game the system and place the bulk of the allowable kW on the CAV fan and not the Baseline's SA and RA fans.  It can go either way so I think this new clarity is helpful.

I wasn't sure about the last part of your comment but assumed you were referring to "professional judgment" when selecting fans in the design process.  Did I miss an important modeling insight?

Mike Rosenberg's section is a welcome improvement but it is still a challenging aspect.
You could be proportioning power (kW) across fans with different operation.  For example:

-          CAV exhaust fan vs. VFD driven supply & return fans

-          "Powered exhaust" fans that only operate to provide relief during economizer mode vs. normal supply fans

In some instances, applying a bit of professional judgment will get better results in terms of fan energy (kWh) and fan heat (DT and resultant heating and cooling loads).

James---

This was discussed recently in the posts.  See the attached response from last Tuesday.

Mike Rosenberg commented that this is being addressed in the upcoming 90.1-2010 as such:

G3.1.2.10.1 The calculated system fan power shall be
distributed to supply, return, exhaust, and relief fans in the
same proportion as the proposed design.

App G says that if the proposed building has return fans, the baseline building is to be modeled with them as well, sized either at the minimum required to ensure ventilation, or 90% of the supply volume, whichever is greater.  And the fan power calculations show that the KW allowance is for all supply, return, exhaust and relief fans combined.

How do you generally pro-rate the fan power between supply and return fans in the baseline model?  Ultimately it probably doesn't make too much difference, but is there an actual ruling that tells you how to do this?

James,

 

I do appreciate the heads up - I've been reading the ongoing discussion
with interest!

 

In the particular case I referenced, it didn't seem a big deal to me at
the time as to my understanding my baseline supply and return fans were
operating in tandem, but as I think it through now, I see this might
skew the results somewhat with regard to fan energies in the airstreams.


 

This has got me wondering:  What, if anything, does 90.1 or similar have
to say regarding fan heat in the baseline airstreams?  

 

I've developed a practice in eQuest of intentionally specifying baseline
fan motors as outside the airstreams.  I've done this specifically to
not have their heat incident on the airstreams, because the procedure I
follow for calculating baseline efficiencies (backing out the calculated
fan energy, Pfan, from the prescribed efficiencies), can become a
potentially cumbersome/iterative process otherwise.  For example, a
simulated baseline sizing run gives an airflow/capacity, from which I
calculate Pfan, which once entered and simulated affects the calculated
capacity, which affects the airflow, so I have to recalculate Pfan...
and so forth until the reported figures match my calculations.  For one
system this is cake, but when I've got a bunch of baseline systems it's
quite a pain.

 

I recognize some others follow a baseline efficiency procedure that
don't involve the Pfan for baseline heating/cooling efficiency
calculations, for whom baseline fan heat energy is a moot concern, but
for the moment that's really another can of worms I'd rather not open...
I'd specifically like to hear if anyone knows of what guidance is or
isn't out there for whether and  to what extent baseline fan heat should
be incident on baseline airstreams.  

 

Thanks again to everyone for providing such continuously supportive and
productive discussions - it makes me proud to be a part of this
community!

Dear Nick,

 

It's not a big deal, but the physics are a little different if you put
some energy from the fan in the Return air stream and some in the supply
air.  Some of the return air energy is normally exhausted and the coil
never sees it.  Probably preaching to the choir here, but can't help

Last time I did this, I entered 0.00 kW/CFM for the return fans, and all
of the calculated kW/CFM for the supply fans - better to keep it in one
place imho to avoid the headache of explaining it.  Just got news that

If you wanted to distribute the power regardless, I'd do it by weighting

Dear Nick et al,

 

90.1 does not specify how to split up the fan heat when there is more than
one fan (although I haven't read the 2010 version yet).  My goal is to model
something close to reality, so I split supply and return fan power in rough
proportion to their total static pressure in the Proposed system.

If the (proposed) supply fan moves air against 4" TSP and the return fan
against 1" TSP, I allot 80% of the baseline power to the supply fan, 20% to
the return fan.  I don't try to be super precise, just reasonably close.
This requires a little more art than science if you have a VAV supply fan
and, say, a constant volume relief fan.

On a related note, I always model Baseline systems with draw-through fans
because:

.         ASHRAE is silent on the matter and 

.         The extra fan heat in the airstream results in a little more
airflow and makes it more favorable for the Proposed system J

.         Let me know if anyone thinks that's cheating!

 

I use EnergyPlus exclusively, but I suspect that it should work for any
software to do the following as a one-shot
get-the-baseline-fan-power-correct approach:

.         Knowing that fan power is always related to CFM

.         Also knowing (or assuming) fan and motor efficiency

.         And knowing any pressure correction

.         I calculate the system delta P that will result in the desired fan
power

.         Then I use that delta P, and those efficiencies as my baseline
input values

.         Fan power comes out right on the money every time (with
auto-sizing)

 

For example, using a System 3 or 4:

CFM * .00094 = allowable BHP (assuming no pressure correction)

 

Delta P = BHP *                     (fan eff'y * motor eff'y) * 6356 / CFM

                = (CFM * .00094) * (fan eff'y * motor eff'y) * 6356 / CFM

                = .00094 *                (fan eff'y * motor eff'y) * 6356

                = 5.9746 *                (fan eff'y * motor eff'y)

 

Note that CFM is not relevant to this calculation, making it very handy for
autosizing!  Also note that I combine the fan and motor efficiencies because
E+ uses their product as the single "fan efficiency" input, rather than
keeping fan mechanical and motor efficiencies separate.  Your software may
not do that.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] pro-rating fan power to supply/return fans per
90.1-2007?

 

App G says that if the proposed building has return fans, the baseline
building is to be modeled with them as well, sized either at the minimum
required to ensure ventilation, or 90% of the supply volume, whichever is
greater.  And the fan power calculations show that the KW allowance is for
all supply, return, exhaust and relief fans combined.  

 

How do you generally pro-rate the fan power between supply and return fans
in the baseline model?  Ultimately it probably doesn't make too much
difference, but is there an actual ruling that tells you how to do this?

 

Thanks,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] question about LEED sample forms
Message-ID: <SNT113-W15BC44F895227E065E15E2C6B10@phx.gbl>


Hi all,
 
I've got an energy simulation project from a LEED-related firm. 
 
I understand that LEED EA sample forms are available on LEED online site,
 
but since I'm not planning to pursue the LEED area, 
 
it is rather unnecessary for me to register.
 
Is there any way I can get a sample form?
 
Thank you.

Message-ID: <DUB104-w45163A0A0535D16983036EF0B10@phx.gbl>


hi all I was wondering if somebody could share some insight to the ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G3.1.2.2 point regarding heating and cooling equipment sizing based on building energy simulations. It is stated that the equipment should be oversized by a factor of 1.25 for heating and 1.15 for cooling. Are these "safety factors" based on the uncertainty associated with building energy simulations or a requirement that makes sure that the system can respond quickly enough during startup? Why are there different factors applied for heating and cooling?thanks!Milda

Message-ID: <AANLkTinZZEUHtBzV=KhOH1j3HfgpSPmspkkBQENq8qGD@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

User's manual for ASHRAE 90.1 says "For systems 1,5 and 7 (except for
purchased hot water or steam), the baseline building design hot water pump
power shall be 19 W/gpm". (page G-30)

I am confused if I have to use the proposed pumps in case I have purchased
hot water.

The chilled water pumps are always (as i understand) modeled at 22 W/gpm.

Varun---

 

If you have purchased hot water in the proposed building and the project
is pursuing LEED certification (which I assume it is) you need to use
USGBC's Treatment of District or Campus Thermal Energy in LEED V2 and
LEED 2009 - Design & Construction.  I've attached it as a reference.
You basically have two options: 1.) building stand-alone scenario where
only the downstream equipment is modeled and hot water is
metered/purchased, or; 2.) aggregate building/DES scenario where the
upstream equipment with its efficiencies or lack thereof are modeled in
the proposed design against 90.1.

Thanks Andrew,

I did read this and we are according to this i have to change my system type
to 7 from system 5 as I have district heating and cooling.
But I am worried about the hot water pump W/gpm specifically.
Should I just or Can I just go ahead and use 19 W/gpm.

Message-ID: <556104.56855.qm@web120606.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Hello all,
I have a building that has radiator heating system and no cooling system 
designed. The system that I have to model for the baseline building is Packaged 
VAV with Reheat. According to ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G, Table G3.1.1b "All 
conditioned spaces in the proposed design shall be simulated as being both 
heated and cooled..." Also according to Table G3.1.10d "Where no cooling system 
has been specified, the cooling system shall be identical to the system modeled 
in the baseline building design". Does that mean that the proposed building 
model should include Packaged VAV with Reheat (with heating coils set to be 
always off) along with the radiator heating system in order to correctly model 
the cooling part?

Thank you!
Lyuben

Rob,

 

You can try but I really doubt if the reviewer will see it that way. I
always consider it its own HVAC system in the proposed model and lump it
in with the one system per floor HVAC system in the baseline model.

 

I do not see much of a benefit for counting this as a process load,
maybe you can explain why you want to do this.

Assuming we're talking about 90.1, the definition for process load reads
something like "loads that don't have anything to do with HVAC..." so
you could make the case that a small IT closet split DX unit or
thermostat-controlled exhaust fan is not a process load, and therefore
the HVAC must be modeled as a system.  Why would one want to do this?
You could demonstrate better performance with your efficient (?) system.

 

On the other hand, loads in small IT closest are commonly core zones
with 24/7 loads, and as a result any such system would be running 24/7
and/or on a consistent basis.  An offshoot is you could very simply roll
any A/C for such spaces into the room's W/SF, and there would
potentially be little difference in consumed energy modeled.  Why would
one want to do this?  Objectively:  It's easy/fast.  

 

If those were the only two points of interest on the table, as your
reviewer I wouldn't care either way.

 

That said, the two above paths result in a pretty different baseline
scenario:  On the one hand you end up with a baseline system against
which your proposed system may excel or underperform against in handling
the data/IT room's heat loads.  In the other case you have zero direct
conditioning of the loads in that space in either model, which would
have to propagate into adjacent spaces/systems via partitions - which is
in most cases a step or two away from reality.   Where one approach is
"removed" from reality and the other may objectively "reward/punish" the
design decisions made to condition that space, I think it's pretty clear
which is the preferable judgment from a reviewer's standpoint.

 

Then again, I'm not your reviewer ;).

also note that if you're dealing with a small IT closet, or data room, 
90.1 applies to comfort cooling applications.  i.e. people comfort, not 
machinery comfort.  try getting a liebert unit per the efficiency 
requirements of 90.1 chapter 6.  probably won't happen.  if you're just 
dealing w/a small IT closet or small data room and it is served by a 
packaged dx system i've just put them in both the proposed and baseline 
since it constitutes a single thermal zone.

but as far as process loads go, i typically include it/data in process 
loads & haven't had that questioned yet.  it does, after all, add to the 
total process that reviewer's look for being 25% of the baseline 
building cost.

James,
?????????? Thank you for your responce. I am really confused because having 
night purge requires that the base case and proposed case have different 
operating schedules. The proposed case controls will check the space and outdoor 
temperatures at night and run the fans.
However for the base case the fans are?turned off at night. Dosen't ASHRAE 90.1 
appendix G require us to have the same operating schedules for the base and 
proposed case.

thanks,
raj

Dear all,

Dassault have done a cracking job on this.
Most of the command aliases are the same as AutoCAD. e.g. l[space] for 
line, m[space] for move.
DWG and DXF compatibility back to release 12 (which is more than you can 
say for AutoCAD 2010).
No Express tools (although it does have "Express" layer tools which 
where what you wanted from the Express tools anyway).
No Autolisp, ARX, etc. But LT didn't have this anyway.

Hi!

Sorry for cross-posting, but this, being a reply to a message on the 
building-simulation list, may be of interest for subscribers of the 
general cad-linux-list, too.

Draftsight works nicely, the only pitfall right now I have experienced 
is that the Linux beta is currently available only as a 32bit binary. 
Users may not be aware that they can use 32bit software on 64bit Linux 
installations, as most package managers will cancel the installation 
with a warning. I forced installation on my Ubuntu amd64 as such:

sudo dpkg --force-architecture -i DraftSight.deb

At the first try, this gave me warnings about missing dependencies, 
which could be solved by the standard package installation tools in 
Ubuntu. Than, the above command installed the DraftSight (32bit-)package 
from the Website, which is perfectly useful for people working on 2d 
drawings. Export of SVG makes it easy to transfer drawings into e.g. 
layout tools, and a PDF export options allows quick generation of 
documents for review by non-CAD folks.

Cheers, Lars.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Difference in chiller energy for VAV and CAV system
Message-ID: <579667.32637.qm@web95212.mail.in2.yahoo.com>

Dear All,

I am comparing the energy performance of a constant volume and variable volume 
system for a composite climate of India (New Delhi) in EnergyPlus. The building 
area is 7500 sq m. The chiller capacity is same for both the cases. The chilled 
water to the cooling coils is supplied by a constant speed pump. 


The savings in the fan energy is evident due to variable speed of the supply fan 
in case of VAV. However i am getting energy saving in cooling energy (chiller 
energy) also, in VAV compared to CAV, which i feel is due to higher delta T 
(chilled water) across cooling coil for CAV compared to VAV, this in turns 
increases the chiller electricity consumption. However while discussions with 
some consultant, it is their feeling that the cooling energy would remain same 
for both type of systems.

I want to ask has someone else tried this simulation and would there be any 
difference in cooling energy or not? 

Thanks in advance.
Deepak

So, if i have a large IT space with numerous data racks, the HVAC system
could fall into the G3.1.1 Exception b that states that since it is
thermally different than all other spaces around it, it can be modeled as
its own system in the baseline model.  This would reward/penalize as you
guys are saying.

Now, to further the other part of the discussion, the definition of process
energy stats any energy consumed in support of processes other than
conditiong spaces and maintaining comfort and amenities for the occupants.
 This HVAC system would be maintaining "comfort" even though there is no
occupants in the space?

Thanks for all the help guys, hope your monday is treating you well.

Rob

Raj,

 

This is where Section G2.5 comes in - you can model the night purge as
an exceptional calculation methodology and take credit for it that way.
It will require a parametric model or even a third model (depending on
your approach to parametric models).

           Thank you for your responce. I am really confused because

However for the base case the fans are turned off at night. Dosen't

Deepak,

Here are some thoughts:

?         Less fan energy  = less cooling load, since the fan energy is a part of the total cooling load.

?         If the pump is variable volume, the pump energy required for VAV fans will be slightly less due to less fan heat to cool.

?         If you are using the identical chiller for each system (VAV, CAV), then the chiller should use less energy also, due to less fan and pump heat.

?         A more common comparison would be to contrast a VAV chiller system with a CAV packaged rooftop system.  For that comparison, the part load efficiencies of chiller and compressor / DX coil will be a major factor. Dehumidification will also be different for DX vs. chilled water coils.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Difference in chiller energy for VAV and CAV system

 

Dear All,

I am comparing the energy performance of a constant volume and variable volume system for a composite climate of India (New Delhi) in EnergyPlus. The building area is 7500 sq m. The chiller capacity is same for both the cases. The chilled water to the cooling coils is supplied by a constant speed pump. 

The savings in the fan energy is evident due to variable speed of the supply fan in case of VAV. However i am getting energy saving in cooling energy (chiller energy) also, in VAV compared to CAV, which i feel is due to higher delta T (chilled water) across cooling coil for CAV compared to VAV, this in turns increases the chiller electricity consumption. However while discussions with some consultant, it is their feeling that the cooling energy would remain same for both type of systems.

I want to ask has someone else tried this simulation and would there be any difference in cooling energy or not? 
Thanks in advance.
Deepak

There are several things going on here:

- Yes, the lower fan energy for VAV will add less heat to the chilled water
loop.  This will propogate to the pumps, chillers, and heat rejection.
- Chilled water coils are complex heat-exchangers, which do not exibit
linear behavior.  Reducing the air flow decreases the water-side coil
effectiveness; therefore, at a given load, a CAV system will have a larger
chilled water delta-T.
- With equivalent pumping schemes, this will result in pump savings for the
CAV system (in the absence of 3-way valves).  I'm not sure about ePlus, but
this can be demonstrated in the latest DOE2.2.
- In reality, the larger chilled water delta-T will decrease chiller lift
and increase its efficiency.  Again I'm not sure about ePlus, but in DOE2.2,
chiller curves are a function of a dT parameter which is the difference
between condenser entering and chilled water leaving temperatures.  Its an
attempt to account for chiller lift, but it does not give an efficiency
credit for increasing the chilled water delta-T.  So, you will not see the
chiller efficiency boost in DOE2 for CAV systems due to a greater chilled
water delta-T.

In my experience, the VAV fan savings (and reduced chilled water load
savings) usually outweigh the pump and chiller savings for CAV.  However,
it varies from building to building.  For example, if you had a rare
building with a low air-side static pressure drop to begin with and a long,
high head pumping system, then its possible that the CAV system will be more
efficient overall.

Hi All,
                If i am knowing Chilled water leaving temperature and
COP of chiller so can i calculate condenser water entering temperature
by the formula

                          COP = Te/Tc-Te

Where Te is evaporator temperature which will be chilled water leaving
temperature and Tc is condenser temperature ie condenser water
entering temperature .


Thanks
Sambhav.

I have a bit different view of this:
 
The load seen by the chiller is not just the load in the zones, but the load
from the system.  The system load is what is required to cool the supply
flow down to the supply air temperature (SAT) setpoint.  The SAT is either
fixed, or cold enough to satisfy the zone requiring the most cooling (the
"critical" zone), assuming the zone loads are met.  All zones except for the
critical zone don't need as much cooling.  In a VAV system, the cooling is
reduced via reduced flow.  This reduced flow means less system load to the
chiller plant.  In contrast, the CAV system load does not get reduced
because some zones have lower loads.  The full fan flow needs to be cooled
to the SAT.  In this case, the non-critical zones are kept from being
overcooled by the addition of reheat.
 
Regards,
Bill

Deepak,

Here are some thoughts:

.         Less fan energy  = less cooling load, since the fan energy is a
part of the total cooling load.

.         If the pump is variable volume, the pump energy required for VAV
fans will be slightly less due to less fan heat to cool.

.         If you are using the identical chiller for each system (VAV, CAV),
then the chiller should use less energy also, due to less fan and pump heat.

.         A more common comparison would be to contrast a VAV chiller system
with a CAV packaged rooftop system.  For that comparison, the part load
efficiencies of chiller and compressor / DX coil will be a major factor.
Dehumidification will also be different for DX vs. chilled water coils.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Double Facades - EPlus
Message-ID: <AANLkTimFKRuiwVK_xyfjMUmsLcRk79RW4V4EmF_jY_9X@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

  Does anyone knows how to modeling double facedes in EnergyPlus? Like a
lightweight ceramic facede, located 10cm away from a traditional concrete
masonry wall. I figured if modeling an thin extra zone could be work, or if
its possible to work with the second facede only as a huge shading device. I
think the most important in these cases is the amount of natural convection
that occur around the exterior of the building but none of my proposals,
this fact is taken into account.
I appreciate if anyone can help me,
Sorry about my bad english.

Bill, you're right about that.  A central CAV system with reheat is limited
by the most loaded zone.  My statements before were simply for one air path
and one zone, which is probably rare.  The degree to which this hurts a CAV
system depends on the diversity of the loads.  If all zone loads remain
similar, then the supply air temperature off the CAV coils will start to
float upwards at reduced loads, and you'll see an increased chilled water
delta-T.

As for the increased chiller efficiency, here's my thinking.  At a constant
load with no mixing valves, an increased delta T across the cooling coils
allows for a lower gpm.  Slowing the water flow rate and raising the
entering water temperature increases the effectiveness of the evaporator
barrel (i.e. the enthalpy of the refrigerant now has a greater ability to
approach the enthalpy of the higher enthalpy water).  Running the compressor
as before would over-cool the water.  To maintain a constant chilled water
supply temperature, the mass flow of the refrigerant must be reduced.
Depending on the type of compressor unloading mechanism, this should produce
some energy savings.

This is my understanding simply based on theory, and I'm sure it's much more
complicated in reality.  Again, I know that DOE2 does not account for
varying inlet conditions to the chiller evaporator barrel, but I'm not sure
about ePlus.

I too cannot claim to be capable of tearing a chiller apart and putting it back together, but I can affirm Aaron's fundamentals appear on-cue to my understanding.  Less cooling ? less compressor work ? $$$ savings.

 

The attached email exchange from a few months back may be of interest to those following/participating in this discussion, though it is a bit lengthy.  In it, I attempt to "reverse engineer" the three default curves found in eQuest/DOE2 which together define behavior of a centrifugal chiller, observing and discussing the isolated effects of all the variables that are taken into account on an hourly basis... One following along can see I was a bit puzzled along the way, but arrived at an "ah-ha" moment when I followed through and applied the curves against each other to observe their net effects on efficiency under set conditions.

 

My hope then and now is that sharing this thought process may help others arrive at their own "eureka" moments =).

There are several things going on here:

 

- Yes, the lower fan energy for VAV will add less heat to the chilled water loop.  This will propogate to the pumps, chillers, and heat rejection.

- Chilled water coils are complex heat-exchangers, which do not exibit linear behavior.  Reducing the air flow decreases the water-side coil effectiveness; therefore, at a given load, a CAV system will have a larger chilled water delta-T.

- With equivalent pumping schemes, this will result in pump savings for the CAV system (in the absence of 3-way valves).  I'm not sure about ePlus, but this can be demonstrated in the latest DOE2.2.

- In reality, the larger chilled water delta-T will decrease chiller lift and increase its efficiency.  Again I'm not sure about ePlus, but in DOE2.2, chiller curves are a function of a dT parameter which is the difference between condenser entering and chilled water leaving temperatures.  Its an attempt to account for chiller lift, but it does not give an efficiency credit for increasing the chilled water delta-T.  So, you will not see the chiller efficiency boost in DOE2 for CAV systems due to a greater chilled water delta-T.

 

In my experience, the VAV fan savings (and reduced chilled water load savings) usually outweigh the pump and chiller savings for CAV.  However, it varies from building to building.  For example, if you had a rare building with a low air-side static pressure drop to begin with and a long, high head pumping system, then its possible that the CAV system will be more efficient overall.

Hi Francisco.

If your facade is made up of only opaque construction and/or you want to 
make a simple study of it, you can check the 
SurfaceProperty:ExteriorNaturalVentedCavity. For more detailed 
modelling, or if you facade is made of glassings, you should model the 
facade as a independent zone, and use airflownetwork objects to setup 
openings, virtual partitions and airflow.
Convection on the outside of the facade shouldn't be much of a problem, 
the tricky one is the inside convection. EPlus doens't have an algorithm 
specified for these kinds of building elements, so you'll have to choose 
the one that best suits your needs.

Pedro.

Dear Genia,

Please see the DOE web site for more information about the tax deduction and the following NREL report for guidance on calculating the savings.  In addition, DOE and NREL are working on a simplified tool for the tax deduction calculations that will be available in April.

There are specific rules for the procedure included in the NREL/TP 550-40467.  You are supposed to follow the 90.1-2004 Appendix G (since to 2001 does not have an Appendix G)  you are also supposed to use many utilization and tstat schedules from California Title 24.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Corporate Deduction, comparison of the proposed design with the baseline design by ASHRAE 90.1-2001

 

Good Afternoon,

Our client would like to get a tax deduction reducing the building's energy and power costs by 50% in comparison to a building meeting requirements set by ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2001.  This standard does not have Appendix G.   Could anybody help to understand,please,  how I can do it. 
Do I need to Use section 11 ( Energy cost budget method) of the standard or  I need to use the same systems and plants in both cases, but different lighting density, building envelope and energy rates according to the actual design for the proposed design and Standard 90.1-2001 for the baseline design? 


Thanks.

 Unmet Load Requirements (G3.1.2.2)
Message-ID: <EEDE9805CD37A340B3B42BE1F6EDFFE38764F6082C@exc1.olace.com>

Hello Everyone,

I know there have been quite a few posts in the past regarding the definition and clarification of unmet hours in an energy model.  I had a question outside of that - particularly when the baseline system needs to be resized to meet the requirements of G3.1.2.2:

If unmet load hours in the proposed design exceed the unmet load hours in the baseline building by more than 50, simulated capacities in the baseline building shall be decreased incrementally and the building resimulated until the unmet load hours are within 50 of the unmet load hours of the proposed design.

When we do this, do we need to resize the CFM of the system to maintain the supply-air-to-room-air temperature difference of 20?F, etc. used in sizing the baseline?  I could see this becoming a lengthy process of reducing cooling capacity, then fan CFM, etc. and was just wondering if anyone had any thoughts on it.

Thanks,
Kerry

Message-ID: <D1168E6C4207B742BFC631BD652B1E922B7AEE9E17@MAILBOX1.nrel.gov>

Hello,

Are there any known resources that provide internal mass estimates (mass/floor area) for energy modeling of big-box commercial retail stores, particularly of the grocery store type?  Obviously, internal mass estimations have a significant impact on HVAC energy consumption and, as I am experiencing, the default internal mass amounts in the EnergyPlus reference buildings tend to be an underestimate for retail stores.

Thanks!

There is also a winnepeg weather file available in EPW format that you can translate to WEA with the Weather utility in EnergyPlus. Search for 'energyplus weather' to get the link.

  knowing that

1) appendix a, section 6.1, references that "For the purpose of Section 
A1.2, the base assembly is a slab floor of 6 in. concrete poured 
directly on to the earth ..." meets the requirement for an unheated slab 
f-factor of 0.73, and
2) section a6.3, f-factors for slab-on-grade floors, a.6.3.1 states:  
"/F-factors/ for slab-on-grade floors shall be taken from Table A6.3", and
3) section a6.3.2 states: "These /F-factors/ are acceptable for all 
/slab-on-grade floors/."

does the "all slab-on-grade floors" really mean any thickness of 
slab-on-grade?  i.e. section 6.1 references a 6-inch uninsulated slab 
meeting the 0.73 f-factor requirement, but per sections a6.3.2 and table 
a6.3 a 4-inch uninsulated slab (or an 8-inch uninsulated slab) would 
also meet the 0.73 f-factor requirement.  so why would section a6.1 
specify a 6-inch slab when any slab thickness will suffice?  the user's 
manuals (both years) just refer to table a6.3 for f-factor values.

the state of washington has a similar section in its energy code (see 
link below), page 41, table 4-2.  section 1003.2 (also page 41) lists 
"All on-grade slab floors as assumed to be 6 inch concrete poured 
directly onto the earth."    note that on page 40, table 10.1, the 
f-factors decrease the deeper the below grade the slab-on-grade floor is.

Kiran,
I would say that you can select the best tool depending on your needs and the required output.
The mode of the DSF (natural/mechanical ventilation), the control systems, the position of shading within the ventilated cavity, the type of DSF (multi-story, box window, etc), the origin and destination of the air (DSF, airflow window), etc are some of the parameters that will define that.
In terms of tool validation of DSF there was an IEA validation task (34) (http://www.iea-shc.org/task34/subtask/index.html) that you can look into and see the comparative and empirical output.
I am using IDA ICE 4.0 (incorporates the ISO 15099) and E+ depending on my needs. I believe that in DSFs it is essential to have an insight on the tools physics and these 2 tools allow you that.
There are simpler tools depending on your needs such as Parasol (also using the ISO 15099) and WIS for steady state boundary conditions.
As to calculation methods you can download the literature review report from the IEA website: http://www.iea-shc.org/publications/downloads/Task34-Double_Skin_Facades_A_Literature_Review1.pdf
I hope this is of some use.
Best regards,
Harris Poirazis

Hi All,
           There are some conditioned rooms in my building which are
served by two small ceiling suspended AHU but how can we assign two
systems(AHU) to a  single zone, assigning of 1 system to two or more
zones is possible can the reverse be possible also, if not then the
two sytems which are assigned for same zone will have individual
kw/cfm  how can i get equivalent kw/cfm which is combining the two

i mean to say that the two AHUs will have there cfms i can create a
single system(AHU)  of cfm equal to sum of both but how will i get
kw/cfm for this system i cannot add the two systems (AHU1,2) motor KW
.

I anticipate for any reply

Thanks

Opportunity Announcement

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is currently 
sponsoring a project to develop (1) job task analyses (JTAs), which 
identify and catalog all of the activities a worker performs in a 
given job; and (2) the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs), which 
define the minimum requirements necessary for a person to adequately 
perform those tasks, for the following six commercial building job
categories:

- Energy modeler
- Operating engineer/building technician
- Building energy auditor
- Energy/sustainability manager
- Commissioning/retro-commissioning practitioner
- Facility manager

The project goal is to create "national guidelines" which will define 
a common body of knowledge that any training organization will be able 
to draw from when developing curriculum, helping to bring the core 
competencies imparted by training organizations to their trainees into 
common alignment. This body of knowledge will also be used by the 
General Services Administration and the Department of Energy to help 
meet the requirements of the Federal Buildings Personnel Training Act 
of 2010.

To facilitate development of the JTAs/KSAs, Professional Testing, 
Inc. is seeking current industry practitioners who are interested in 
helping to define, promote energy efficiency in, and support their 
field of practice by participating in these JTA/KSA development 
workshops. Interested individuals are invited to submit their 
credentials at http://proftesting.rapidinsites.com. Please note that
each JTA/KSA workshop will take place in Denver, Colorado and is
anticipated to last 3 full days (not including travel). Reimbursement
for travel costs up to a fixed amount and a travel per diem will be
awarded to individuals selected for participation. Additional project
details, including how practitioners will be selected and where to
direct project-related questions, can be found using the above link.

NREL and Professional Testing, Inc. are excited to present this unique 
opportunity for individuals to have their voices heard in this 
important discussion. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
The NREL Commercial Workforce Development Team

Hm?

 

The heart of your query isn?t really crystal clear to me, but I?ll take a stab:

 

Section A1.2 says if a building official feels sections A2 through A8 do not ?adequately represent? the proposed construction, Section A9 is to be used, but A.9.2.e. curtly says no alternate procedures are permitted to find alternative F-factors for SOG floors.  At first glance, it would appear the 90.1 committee might be giving any extremely meticulous building officials/reviewers/designers the run-around.

 

The way I see it, Section A6 in its entirety is suggesting concrete slab thickness varying from 6 inches ?doesn?t matter much.?  

 

More precisely: ?Real-world? SOG design within the confines of any 90.1 calculations shall be restricted to the following variables:

1.       The R-value of any insulation, if present

2.       The configuration of said insulation, if present,

3.       Whether the slab is heated

 

Note there are a series of variables are not brought up or either explicitly held constant, beyond slab thickness, and I understand these all can have a decent effect on perimeter conductivity:

1.       What?s on top of the slab

2.       Slab height relative to grade / footing exposure

3.       Soil conductivity/moisture properties

 

For further reading, I know there are multiple white papers out there going well into depth if that?s what you?re seeking ? LBNL comes to mind as being part of some research?  I personally haven?t charged myself with crunching the numbers up to this point, rather letting my software of choice do the legwork.

 

The reasons I would speculate that section A6.1 specifies a 6? thickness would include

1.       It helps ground/quantify from what the numbers in the table are derived

2.       It gives a reference to the base construction?s thermal mass ? necessary should you wish to model something different for your proposed constructions within the context of, say, an Appendix G performance rating.

3.       While a strict reading of appendix A might lead one to believe all constructions used in all calculations must follow the prescribed values, I?ve only ever run into one reviewer who called into question the use of custom constructions and ASHRAE Fundamentals-derived materials/properties which do not appear within the (relatively abbreviated) Appendix A.  I think the real intent is to provide a description of those constructions as defined earlier in the code ? namely envelope constructions in the context of describing either a ?prescriptive minimum? or in the context of energy modeling as the ?baseline constructions.?  I do not believe the intent of Appendix A is to restrict/limit the design decisions that may be made outside of the presented materials/tables.

 

I?m on a bit of a limb here, but I?m speculating at what may have prompted your question? does this miss the mark?

2) section a6.3, f-factors for slab-on-grade floors, a.6.3.1 states:  "F-factors for slab-on-grade floors shall be taken from Table A6.3", and
3) section a6.3.2 states: "These F-factors are acceptable for all slab-on-grade floors."

does the "all slab-on-grade floors" really mean any thickness of slab-on-grade?  i.e. section 6.1 references a 6-inch uninsulated slab meeting the 0.73 f-factor requirement, but per sections a6.3.2 and table a6.3 a 4-inch uninsulated slab (or an 8-inch uninsulated slab) would also meet the 0.73 f-factor requirement.  so why would section a6.1 specify a 6-inch slab when any slab thickness will suffice?  the user's manuals (both years) just refer to table a6.3 for f-factor values.

the state of washington has a similar section in its energy code (see link below), page 41, table 4-2.  section 1003.2 (also page 41) lists "All on-grade slab floors as assumed to be 6 inch concrete poured directly onto the earth."    note that on page 40, table 10.1, the f-factors decrease the deeper the below grade the slab-on-grade floor is.

you're pretty much right on the same track.  i realized after i sent it 
the email only had the main question buried in the middle and i have a 
side question to go with it.

main question:  what is the f-factor of a 4" concrete slab?
reason for question:  most architects in southern arizona specify, and 
contractors build, an unheatd 4" concrete slab for standard 
office/retail.  6" concrete slab for warehouses and other spaces where 
heavier loads are common.

secondary question:  does a building with a 4" concrete slab meet the 
f-factor requirements of 90.1 per table A6.3?  (unheated or heated, 
unheated in my case though).
reason for question:  need to demonstrate 90.1-2004/2007 compliance for 
floor f-factor.  unclear as to answer.

1.  all of the research/other references to f-factors that i've found 
also reference the 6" slab, the same research, and 90.1, and from what 
i've seen/can tell they only tested at a 6" slab with 8" and 4" walls 
and varying insulations.
2.  the problem with calculating an f-factor, even if using ashrae 
fundamentals derived constructions, per 90.1, is that calculations are 
prohibited by Section A9 Determination of Alternate Assembly U-Factors, 
C-Factors, or F-Factors, or Heat Capacities, SubSection A9.2(e), 
"Slab-on-Grade Floors:  no testing or calculations allowed."
3.  which leads me back to section a6.3.2, which states in reference to 
Table A6.3, "These /F-factors/ are acceptable for all /slab-on-grade 
floors/." - but is it really?  how does one defend a building official 
or leed review comment for a 4" slab f-factor?   if section a.6.3.2 is 
literally correct then the f-factor for an unheated 4" slab is the same 
0.73 as an unheated 6" slab.  since the f-factor is based on linear feet 
and not square feet this could make sense if the thermal capacity of the 
thickness of the slab does not matter for f-factor.  note though that 
4", 6", and 8" lightweight concrete all have the same conductivity 
(3.7), density (80), and specific heat (0.22) (per the 2009 
fundamentals).  knowing the thickness of the slab may be insignificant 
to the f-factor calculation is one thing, proving/demonstrating it to a 
code official/leed reviewer is another.  i have asked my local code 
officials (who are pe's also) and they don't know the the answer(s) 
either ...

In 90.1-2004, 7.4.5.2 Pool Covers - a pool heated 
higher than 90?F required an R12 pool cover.  We 
can't locate a automated retraction system with 
more than an R5.  I am trying to determine 
exactly what site-recovered energy 
constitutes.  The project does recover condenser 
heat from the chiller to preheat the pool area 
DHW and pool make-up water.  I believe that 
qualifies as site-recovered energy.   My question 
is does a ground source heat pump or air source 
heat pump count as site-recovered energy?

Alright, we are on the same page!

 

Main Question Answer in short:  Use the F-factor of a 6? slab as listed in the table.  It?s less work for you, it?s defensible to a reviewer, and this should not significantly impact any calculations relative to the conductivity of an otherwise equivalent 4? slab.

 

Fleshed out responses:

1.       I?ve observed the same.

2.       This ?runaround?/dead-end you?re also pointing out is the first point of defense against any reviewer or local code officials who would have you do anything else.  90.1 explicitly does not permit any calculations/methodology outside of using that table.

3.       So that you can sleep easy at night, note that 90.1 also draws a line regarding what constitutes a  significant deviation by defining the term ?adequately represented?:  

a.       A1.2.b.  reads (abbreviated): ?An assembly is deemed to be adequately represented if ? changes ? to the base assembly do not increase or decrease the R-value by more than 2 from that indicated??  

b.      This may seem somewhat arbitrary in discussion of F-factors, but you can be reasonably assured (and further defend the decision to use a 6? F-factor) that an additional 2 inches of concrete in your proposed slab construction, considering all possible concrete mixes, is very likely not going to swing the net R-value of the slab + footing by more than 2. 

c.       My materials charts reference (from 2001 fundamentals) lists only 2 exceptions to that statement ? they?re the very least-dense options for ?polystyrene aggregate? and ?foam concretes*,? which stand apart with a shared listed density of 20pcf.  These two in the list have an ?R-per-inch? value above 1.  All other values for concrete are around or less than 0.5 per inch.

d.      If you have to, I?m pretty certain you can quickly calculate the net difference from a 6? slab using materials in fundamentals per above (or better yet, whatever?s listed in Appendix A for concrete), and show any meticulous reviewers/officials that the net difference in terms of R-value is less than 2, referencing A1.2.b.

 

~Nick

 

* On a complete tangent, a friend of mine did a masters report on lightweight concretes in construction during my last semester, so I once got to play around once with a sample of foam-infused concrete block?  That stuff is a mind bender like clear Pepsi from the 90?s!  Their densities can be in the vicinity of a block of cork, for reference.  Much fun playing one-handed catch with a CMU =).

1.  all of the research/other references to f-factors that i've found also reference the 6" slab, the same research, and 90.1, and from what i've seen/can tell they only tested at a 6" slab with 8" and 4" walls and varying insulations.  
2.  the problem with calculating an f-factor, even if using ashrae fundamentals derived constructions, per 90.1, is that calculations are prohibited by Section A9 Determination of Alternate Assembly U-Factors, C-Factors, or F-Factors, or Heat Capacities, SubSection A9.2(e), "Slab-on-Grade Floors:  no testing or calculations allowed."
3.  which leads me back to section a6.3.2, which states in reference to Table A6.3, "These F-factors are acceptable for all slab-on-grade floors." - but is it really?  how does one defend a building official or leed review comment for a 4" slab f-factor?   if section a.6.3.2 is literally correct then the f-factor for an unheated 4" slab is the same 0.73 as an unheated 6" slab.  since the f-factor is based on linear feet and not square feet this could make sense if the thermal capacity of the thickness of the slab does not matter for f-factor.  note though that 4", 6", and 8" lightweight concrete all have the same conductivity (3.7), density (80), and specific heat (0.22) (per the 2009 fundamentals).  knowing the thickness of the slab may be insignificant to the f-factor calculation is one thing, proving/demonstrating it to a code official/leed reviewer is another.  i have asked my local code officials (who are pe's also) and they don't know the the answer(s) either ...

The heart of your query isn?t really crystal clear to me, but I?ll take a stab:

 

Section A1.2 says if a building official feels sections A2 through A8 do not ?adequately represent? the proposed construction, Section A9 is to be used, but A.9.2.e. curtly says no alternate procedures are permitted to find alternative F-factors for SOG floors.  At first glance, it would appear the 90.1 committee might be giving any extremely meticulous building officials/reviewers/designers the run-around.

 

The way I see it, Section A6 in its entirety is suggesting concrete slab thickness varying from 6 inches ?doesn?t matter much.?  

 

More precisely: ?Real-world? SOG design within the confines of any 90.1 calculations shall be restricted to the following variables:

The R-value of any insulation, if present

The configuration of said insulation, if present,

Whether the slab is heated

 

Note there are a series of variables are not brought up or either explicitly held constant, beyond slab thickness, and I understand these all can have a decent effect on perimeter conductivity:

What?s on top of the slab

Slab height relative to grade / footing exposure

Soil conductivity/moisture properties

 

For further reading, I know there are multiple white papers out there going well into depth if that?s what you?re seeking ? LBNL comes to mind as being part of some research?  I personally haven?t charged myself with crunching the numbers up to this point, rather letting my software of choice do the legwork.

 

The reasons I would speculate that section A6.1 specifies a 6? thickness would include

It helps ground/quantify from what the numbers in the table are derived

It gives a reference to the base construction?s thermal mass ? necessary should you wish to model something different for your proposed constructions within the context of, say, an Appendix G performance rating.

While a strict reading of appendix A might lead one to believe all constructions used in all calculations must follow the prescribed values, I?ve only ever run into one reviewer who called into question the use of custom constructions and ASHRAE Fundamentals-derived materials/properties which do not appear within the (relatively abbreviated) Appendix A.  I think the real intent is to provide a description of those constructions as defined earlier in the code ? namely envelope constructions in the context of describing either a ?prescriptive minimum? or in the context of energy modeling as the ?baseline constructions.?  I do not believe the intent of Appendix A is to restrict/limit the design decisions that may be made outside of the presented materials/tables.

 

I?m on a bit of a limb here, but I?m speculating at what may have prompted your question? does this miss the mark?

knowing that 

1) appendix a, section 6.1, references that "For the purpose of Section A1.2, the base assembly is a slab floor of 6 in. concrete poured directly on to the earth ..." meets the requirement for an unheated slab f-factor of 0.73, and
2) section a6.3, f-factors for slab-on-grade floors, a.6.3.1 states:  "F-factors for slab-on-grade floors shall be taken from Table A6.3", and
3) section a6.3.2 states: "These F-factors are acceptable for all slab-on-grade floors."

does the "all slab-on-grade floors" really mean any thickness of slab-on-grade?  i.e. section 6.1 references a 6-inch uninsulated slab meeting the 0.73 f-factor requirement, but per sections a6.3.2 and table a6.3 a 4-inch uninsulated slab (or an 8-inch uninsulated slab) would also meet the 0.73 f-factor requirement.  so why would section a6.1 specify a 6-inch slab when any slab thickness will suffice?  the user's manuals (both years) just refer to table a6.3 for f-factor values.

the state of washington has a similar section in its energy code (see link below), page 41, table 4-2.  section 1003.2 (also page 41) lists "All on-grade slab floors as assumed to be 6 inch concrete poured directly onto the earth."    note that on page 40, table 10.1, the f-factors decrease the deeper the below grade the slab-on-grade floor is.

Just to throw something out there since you have the motivation right now to research the topic, here?s the extent I?ve ever gone to get to the bottom of the ?F-Factor? questions.  ASHRAE Fundamentals 2009 has a discussion on below-grade heat loss calculations starting on Page 18.30.  They reference a 1969 research paper as a primary source of information: ?Latta, J.K. and G.G. Boileau. 1969. Heat losses from house basements.

Canadian Building 19(10):39.?

 

I haven?t read or researched much beyond 90.1 and Fundamentals for the very reason Nick cited as #1: the standard essentially says not to :)

 

I?m not sure what you?ll find if you are able to get a copy of that research paper, but I?m sure it will shed some interesting light on the topic.

Alright, we are on the same page!

 

Main Question Answer in short:  Use the F-factor of a 6? slab as listed in the table.  It?s less work for you, it?s defensible to a reviewer, and this should not significantly impact any calculations relative to the conductivity of an otherwise equivalent 4? slab.

 

Fleshed out responses:

1.       I?ve observed the same.

2.       This ?runaround?/dead-end you?re also pointing out is the first point of defense against any reviewer or local code officials who would have you do anything else.  90.1 explicitly does not permit any calculations/methodology outside of using that table.

3.       So that you can sleep easy at night, note that 90.1 also draws a line regarding what constitutes a  significant deviation by defining the term ?adequately represented?:  

a.       A1.2.b.  reads (abbreviated): ?An assembly is deemed to be adequately represented if ? changes ? to the base assembly do not increase or decrease the R-value by more than 2 from that indicated??  

b.      This may seem somewhat arbitrary in discussion of F-factors, but you can be reasonably assured (and further defend the decision to use a 6? F-factor) that an additional 2 inches of concrete in your proposed slab construction, considering all possible concrete mixes, is very likely not going to swing the net R-value of the slab + footing by more than 2. 

c.       My materials charts reference (from 2001 fundamentals) lists only 2 exceptions to that statement ? they?re the very least-dense options for ?polystyrene aggregate? and ?foam concretes*,? which stand apart with a shared listed density of 20pcf.  These two in the list have an ?R-per-inch? value above 1.  All other values for concrete are around or less than 0.5 per inch.

d.      If you have to, I?m pretty certain you can quickly calculate the net difference from a 6? slab using materials in fundamentals per above (or better yet, whatever?s listed in Appendix A for concrete), and show any meticulous reviewers/officials that the net difference in terms of R-value is less than 2, referencing A1.2.b.

 

~Nick

 

* On a complete tangent, a friend of mine did a masters report on lightweight concretes in construction during my last semester, so I once got to play around once with a sample of foam-infused concrete block?  That stuff is a mind bender like clear Pepsi from the 90?s!  Their densities can be in the vicinity of a block of cork, for reference.  Much fun playing one-handed catch with a CMU =).

you're pretty much right on the same track.  i realized after i sent it the email only had the main question buried in the middle and i have a side question to go with it. 

main question:  what is the f-factor of a 4" concrete slab?
reason for question:  most architects in southern arizona specify, and contractors build, an unheatd 4" concrete slab for standard office/retail.  6" concrete slab for warehouses and other spaces where heavier loads are common.   

secondary question:  does a building with a 4" concrete slab meet the f-factor requirements of 90.1 per table A6.3?  (unheated or heated, unheated in my case though).

It is my understanding that we use App G for LEED energy credit analysis of
manufacturing facility (which has some offices etc.) and all the
manufacturing load counted as process load. Is this correct?

This is based on the LEED 2.2 narative in the energy credit section
(Standard 90.1 establishes minimum requirements for the energy-efficient

of this standard do not apply to single-family houses, multi-family

The following bullet number 3 in the ashrae standard has me confused, but it
is not included in the LEED 2.2 narative.

2.3 The provisions of this standard do not apply to:

(a) single-family houses, multi-family structures of three stories or fewer

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED 2.2 for manufacturing facility

 

It is my understanding that we use App G for LEED energy credit analysis of
manufacturing facility (which has some offices etc.) and all the
manufacturing load counted as process load. Is this correct? 

 

This is based on the LEED 2.2 narative in the energy credit section
(Standard 90.1 establishes minimum requirements for the energy-efficient
design of buildings, except low-rise residential buildings. The provisions
of this standard do not apply to single-family houses, multi-family
structures of three stories or fewer above grade, manufactured houses
(mobile homes) and manufactured houses (modular), or buildings that do not
use either electricity or fossil fuel).

 

The following bullet number 3 in the ashrae standard has me confused, but it
is not included in the LEED 2.2 narative. 

2.3 

The provisions of this standard do not apply to: 

(a) single-family houses, multi-family structures of three stories or fewer
above grade, manufactured houses (mobile homes) and manufactured houses
(modular),

(b) buildings that do not use either electricity or fossil fuel, or

(c) equipment and portions of building systems that use energy primarily to
provide for industrial, manufacturing, or commercial processes.

It has recently been brought to our attention that some of the
information included in the NREL Opportunity Announcement sent out
last Friday (March 25, 2011) was unclear. The announcement did not
make it obvious that an honorarium would be provided in addition to
the travel per diem and the reimbursement of travel costs. The text
has been updated and a revised announcement has been appended below.


Opportunity Announcement

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is currently 
sponsoring a project to develop (1) job task analyses (JTAs), which 
identify and catalog all of the activities a worker performs in a 
given job; and (2) the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs), which 
define the minimum requirements necessary for a person to adequately 
perform those tasks, for the following six commercial building job
categories:

- Energy modeler
- Operating engineer/building technician
- Building energy auditor
- Energy/sustainability manager
- Commissioning/retro-commissioning practitioner
- Facility manager

The project goal is to create "national guidelines" which will define 
a common body of knowledge that any training organization will be able 
to draw from when developing curriculum, helping to bring the core 
competencies imparted by training organizations to their trainees into 
common alignment. This body of knowledge will also be used by the 
General Services Administration and the Department of Energy to help 
meet the requirements of the Federal Buildings Personnel Training Act 
of 2010.

To facilitate development of the JTAs/KSAs, Professional Testing, 
Inc. is seeking current industry practitioners who are interested in 
helping to define, promote energy efficiency in, and support their 
field of practice by participating in these JTA/KSA development 
workshops. Interested individuals are invited to submit their 
credentials at http://proftesting.rapidinsites.com. Please note that
each JTA/KSA workshop will take place in Denver, Colorado and is
anticipated to last 3 full days (not including travel). Reimbursement
for travel costs up to a fixed amount, a travel per diem, and an
honorarium will be awarded to individuals selected for participation.
Additional project details, including how practitioners will be
selected and where to direct project-related questions, can be found
using the above link.

NREL and Professional Testing, Inc. are excited to present this unique 
opportunity for individuals to have their voices heard in this 
important discussion. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
The NREL Commercial Workforce Development Team

hi , I already submitted this question but there were no responses so I'd like to try again: could somebody share some insight to the ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G3.1.2.2 point regarding heating and cooling equipment sizing based on building energy simulations. It is stated that the equipment should be oversized by a factor of 1.25 for heating and 1.15 for cooling. Are these "safety factors" based on the uncertainty associated with building energy simulations or a requirement that makes sure that the system can respond quickly enough during startup? Why are there different factors applied for heating and cooling?thanks!Milda

Milda,
I think if you are performorming energy simulations for the baseline, it
doesnt matter what is this 25% and 15% upsizing is used for, as it used only
as much capacity it needs to satisify the loads and thermostat. And your
system size should be based on the design results and not simulation results
(that also proposed model).
But nevertheless I always interpret this as you said in your first point,
to cover uncertainity in building simulation.
I also think it helps baseline to reduce its unmet load hours.

Hope this helps.

It gets problematic for these types of facilities, not on the energy side but in meeting the LEED MPRs.  These types of facilities can demonstrate energy savings.

 

Minimum program requirement #5 says that a LEED project has to have at least 1 FTE occupant.

So does that mean that a building that uses lots of energy to house computers or equipment that needs cooling but DOES NOT have any real occupants (other than those who may go there on occasion to check on the equipment, say less than once a day) can still go for LEED certification?

What energy load then would be used for the LEED energy model since none of the energy load is for occupant comfort? Lighting only?

Sorry, I thought I had written a response to this query but can't seem
to find it!

 

On a general note, anyone seeking to better understand the intent behind
various parts of 90.1 Appendix G would be well advised to borrow or
purchase the 2007 User's manual.

 

Here are my condensed thoughts - the user's manual supports some of this
directly:

1.       The oversizing factors appear analogous to "safety factors" in
real-world design, but they exist in 90.1 primarily because it's
recognized the capacity of the baseline systems is an easy means of
cheating the system.  One could very easily decrease relative baseline
performance by undersizing or oversizing the baseline equipment.

2.       With that in mind, and because the loads handled by the
baseline systems are arbitrarily by a unique load profile, 90.1 has to
set something as the sizing factor.  To be fair to real-world systems
which are often oversized, both for "safety factors" and because various
equipment operates more efficiently at <100% capacity, oversizing
factors above 1.0 have been set. 

3.       I think oversizing factor for heating is larger than cooling
primarily because that reflects real-world design for packaged equipment
selection.  After calculating desired loads (and applying design safety
factors), packaged equipment is often selected first on the desired
cooling capacity, and then heating options are considered secondarily.
Where heating capacity options are finite, the result is often heating
elements which are oversized some degree beyond the design heating load.

4.       I would discourage the mindset that oversizing factors are
necessary to prevent unmet heating/cooling hours.  They may mitigate
unmet hours, particularly those occurring as thermostats are coming out
of setback periods (morning warmup), but baseline system capacity is
rarely the root problem in my experience.  In my mind, if a baseline is
set up correctly, oversizing factors of 1.0 ought to result in
sufficient auto-sized capacity.

 

There are inherent "uncertainties" to energy modeling, just as with any
HVAC load calculation, water or electrical service size calculation,
lighting maintained illuminance calcs, LRFD structural design loads and
so on.  Very little in world of building design does not have some sort
of assumed future uncertainty worked into the design via "safety
factors," both prescribed by code and self-imposed as standard practice.
In that context, I don't believe the 90.1 oversizing factors speak to
any uncertainty that's unique to energy modeling.

Our client would like to get a tax deduction reducing the building's energy and power costs by 50% in comparison to a building meeting requirements set by ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2001.  This standard does not have Appendix G.   Could anybody help to understand,please,  how I can do it.
Do I need to Use section 11 ( Energy cost budget method) of the standard or  I need to use the same systems and plants in both cases, but different lighting density, building envelope and energy rates according to the actual design for the proposed design and Standard 90.1-2001 for the baseline design?


Thanks.

Message-ID: <AANLkTiknrO-fLdTodTB5xY-taRppgyJDVGw7Ohg6jr4h@mail.gmail.com>

Has anyone modeled for LEED for Homes before?  I am trying to understand
what the requirements are for the baseline HVAC system so that our design is
sure to be better than the baseline (I understand that the "Rater" will be
performing the final energy analysis at a later date).

My situation:  There will be a total of 64 apartment units between several
different buildings, and each unit has valance with 2 central plants feeding
all the equipment.

thanks for your input!

Will this be a new standalone simulation tool or some 'bridging' tool.   E.g.  an extension or parallel to the EnergyPlus Example File Generator?
http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/cfm/inputs/index.cfm

Of course, either would be welcomed.

So, even though i have no central AC unit, and that i have a chiller that
serves several apt units, i still use this SEER of 13 or 14?  Or do i assume
that because the units are getting chilled water/hot water from a "campus
loop" that the efficiencies for both the baseline and the proposed are
equivalent?

thanks,
Rob

I haven't done a LEED for Homes project in a little while, but when I did,
modeling needed to be done using software approved by HERS (Home Energy
Rating System).  There are a few software packages available.  In general,
they are pretty simple, and difficult to get unless you are a HERS rater.
 For LEED for Homes, LEED kind of tacked onto the HERS program for the
energy portion.  Is there a reason you're using LEED for Homes instead of
LEED for Neighborhood Development or LEED NC?

Honestly, because i was told to.  There is a LEED person on board that said
this is the correct avenue to go.

I do know that the software packages are different then what i am currently
using, but this is more for design purposes rather than for LEED submittal.
 that being said i still want to compare our design to the "expected" values
of the LEED for homes requirements.

>From your description, I am wondering if you have vertical units or

the LEED for Homes mid-rise document in lieu of the standard LEED for Homes.

 

It is completely different approach than a single family low rise detached
home approach.  It is basically an energy model with ASHRAE 90.1 (not even
90.2) approach, Appendix G and all the bells and whistles.

this is the correct avenue to go.  

 

I do know that the software packages are different then what i am currently
using, but this is more for design purposes rather than for LEED submittal.
that being said i still want to compare our design to the "expected" values
of the LEED for homes requirements.

they are pretty simple, and difficult to get unless you are a HERS rater.
For LEED for Homes, LEED kind of tacked onto the HERS program for the energy
portion.  Is there a reason you're using LEED for Homes instead of LEED for
Neighborhood Development or LEED NC?

Has anyone modeled for LEED for Homes before?  I am trying to understand
what the requirements are for the baseline HVAC system so that our design is
sure to be better than the baseline (I understand that the "Rater" will be
performing the final energy analysis at a later date).

 

My situation:  There will be a total of 64 apartment units between several
different buildings, and each unit has valance with 2 central plants feeding
all the equipment.  

 

thanks for your input!

We have a mix of Townhouses that could be 2 or 3 floors, Apartments that are
2 units per floor and 2 or 3 floors.  Nothing is higher than 3 floors.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] process loads for a power plant facility
Message-ID: <4D94DB43.6080407@tess-inc.com>

Colleagues,
   I am interested in hearing your thoughts on how to treat the process 
loads for a power plant that is seeking LEED certification. The facility 
is comparatively small but contains a number of gas turbines as well as 
administrative offices. If I include the entire service area as a 
process load then I suspect the building will get zero savings as the 
electricity generated for the service area is going to be millions of 
times greater than the facility's energy use. However, ignoring that 
process load does not seem fair because the administrative offices will 
be heated with waste heat off the turbines.
Best,
  David

Greetings,
I am doing some research for my MASc thesis in building science, where I am
modeling exterior wall wood frame junctions.  I have two questions:

   1. Which library option do I choose for for a vented  brick cavity: Frame
   Cavity CEN simplified, Frame Cavity NFRC 100-2001, or Frame Cavity slightly
   vented NFRC 100-2001?
   2. Which boundary condition should I choose for the interior side of a
   wall assembly: aluminum frame, thermally broken frame, thermally improved
   frame or wood/vinyl frame?

Thank you in advance,
