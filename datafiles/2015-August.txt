	5 and 6
Message-ID: <708815EF17FC964494540A87EFA1D1C5CCFF64D1@EFOR-MBX-11.doe.local>

Two DOE BTO-sponsored events coming to the Bay Area this week.  As part of a recent collaboration<http://energy.gov/eere/buildings/bto-catalyst> opened with the SunShot Catalyst program, BTO is holding a series of Catalyst Jamathon events around the country.  The Jamathons are in-person events where entrepreneurs, developers, working professionals, students, and mentors work towards crafting video pitches for software product/startup ideas that address key problems in the area of building operations.

This week's Jamathons are both in the Bay Area:
*        Wednesday, August 5: Microsoft Silicon Valley Campus (Mountain View)
      6:00 PM - 9:00 PM PDT

      Registration link:   http://www.eventbrite.com/e/sunshot-catalyst-jamathon-microsoft-silicon-valley-campus-tickets-17838417186?aff=BTO

*       Thursday, August 6: SfunCube (Oakland)

      5:00 PM - 8:30 PM PDT
      Registration link:   http://www.eventbrite.com/e/sunshot-catalyst-jamathon-sfuncube-oakland-ca-tickets-17729364005

If you are interested and available to attend either of these Jamathons, we would love to have you there.  In any case, we would greatly appreciate it if you could spread the word about these events to your contacts in the area.

If you have any questions about the Jamathons or the BTO-Catalyst program more generally, please contact Jared Langevin (jared.langevin at ee.doe.gov<mailto:jared.langevin at ee.doe.gov>), the BTO-Catalyst Lead.

Description: Many project teams consider energy models as simply a tool for meeting LEED's Energy and Atmosphere prerequisite, and obtaining credits towards LEED certification.  Energy modelers develop models often with the simple mandate of achieving compliance.  This approach misses one of the major benefits of developing a detailed whole building energy model: to inform the design process and guide the design team towards decisions that reduce overall energy consumption in a building.  In this panel presentation, we will hear about LEED v4's new integrative process, which encourages design teams to use the energy model to have a dialogue about a building's energy consuming systems earlier in the design process.  We will also hear about ASHRAE Standard Project Committee 209, currently under development, which is looking to set minimum standards and requirements to facilitate the energy model development process.

Message-ID: <21BFCB111AFBDC46955BE94E5F37681E14669F9FBD@HUARD.intranet.MRN.GOUV>

Hello,

In a project for a 24h retail, the exterior lighting need to comply to ASHRAE 90.1 2010 (zone 3). I'm focusing on table 9.4.3-B:

?         In tradable surfaces, there is "Uncovered Parking areas/Parking areas and drive = 1.1 W/m2"

?         In non-tradable surfaces, there is "Parking near 24-hour retail entrances = 800 W per Main entry"
My project has a main entry just next a 2000 m2 parking.

Does anyone know if I can add the 800 W to the 2200 W allowed for the parking (2000 m2 x 1.1 W/m2)?

Many thanks
Julien

My interpretation is that yes, you can add it, but in most cases you
probably don't want to.  I would only dip into the non-tradable if you
can't stay under your standard tradable parking allowance, since it would
only hurt your savings otherwise.  (Non-tradable must be modeled
identically in baseline/proposed.)

Cheers,
Elizabeth

To build on Elizabeth?s response:



If the fixtures illuminating what could be classified as ?nontradable?
parking are also illuminating tradable surfaces (i.e. uncovered parking),
it is to your advantage for a LEED model to treat all parking areas as
uncovered.  GBCI would have you match wattage for those areas between
baseline/proposed cases, and you can?t ?double-count? the area between
surface types.  The net result is that associated installed power is a
?dead load? on your relative savings potential.



If you are documenting installed lighting power to simply demonstrate
compliance with 90.1-2010 however (outside of a LEED project), such
non-tradable distinctions will generally help your case.  I like to avoid
more work than necessary however, and for a large exterior takeoff will
usually run the numbers first without carving out nontradable surface
distinctions.  In my experience: unless you have a lot of fa?ade lighting
to account for, compliance can often be demonstrated with only tradable
surface allowances, and you can then just call it a day and move on to the
next thing.



Best of luck!

Apologies for cross posting!

Tuesday 25th August
6pm - 7.30pm - IBPSA NCC will be holding a summer meeting at Baumann Consulting 1424 K St NW.

We have two presentations:

Urban scale modeling of campus buildings using Virtual PULSE- Mohammad Heidarinejad, Nicholas Mattise, Matthew Dahlhausen, Saber Khoshdel Nikkho

Virtual PULSE development team will present a newly developed web-based urban scale modeling tool, named "Virtual PULSE". The presenter will elaborate details of the model creation with a follow up demonstration of Virtual PULSE for different urban neighborhoods. Virtual PULSE is accessible via: http://virtualpulse.buildsci.us/

And

Occupant impact on building energy consumption and improvement of building energy simulation with occupant information - Yang-Seon Kim

Research from a dozen case studies in commercial buildings suggests that 10-40% of energy can be saved if the occupancy presence/absence is factored into the building operation. Also, to reduce the gap between actual building energy consumption and estimated energy consumption, occupant information is important. This study quantified the impact of occupancy rates for actual commercial building energy consumption with measured data.  Also,  this study found that occupancy rates have a higher correlation with plug-load consumption than with total electricity consumption. This study shows a simplified methodology to use the plug-load consumption as an indicator for occupancy rates in building energy models.

Pre-Greenbuild Workshop on Successful Energy Modeling For LEED Projects

 

Want to know the secret to successful energy modeling for LEED?  Register
<http://www.greenbuildexpo.com/Attendee/Schedule/SessionDetails/35107>  for
our full day education workshop at the Greenbuild Expo this fall.  

 

Workshop Details

This is an intermediate level course and attendees should have energy
modeling experience on at least one LEED project.  The workshop goals are
fourfold:

 

1.    You'll have a more detailed understanding of the prevailing simulation
tools, their capabilities, limitations and how (or when) to use them based
on your project type.  Supporting calculation tools will also be provided,
streamlining your workflow.

2.    You'll have a better understanding of the energy code (ASHRAE 90.1)
and the critical parameters that have a significant impact on energy
performance.  This will help you avoid "surprise" changes to your baseline
that adversely affect energy results.

3.    You'll have a better understanding of the LEED review process and
documentation requirements.  This will help you cut the amount of time spent
on costly post-review model updates.

4.    Implement the new modeling requirements in LEED V4 including ASHRAE
90.1- 2010 updates.

 

Specific topics include, "what's new in v4, generating custom performance
curves," and many others.  See the full list on the registration page.  You
can also contact us <http://www.greenengineer.com/contact-us/>  if you have
specific questions about the content. 

 

The workshop will be held on Tuesday, November 17th.  Seating is limited so
register
<http://www.greenbuildexpo.com/Attendee/Schedule/SessionDetails/35107>
early.  Full day workshop pricing starts at $250.  This workshop is worth 7
hours of continuing education credit.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] SPOT Pro v4.74 released! Final weeks for discounted
	pricing!
Message-ID: <CAAP856wV04SYp5Zrq1e+NekwhCeHTs-ecUNpYYbNToRB7UV81A@mail.gmail.com>

Fellow building simulationists,

A new version of the Sensor Placement + Optimization Tool daylighting and
lighting design software, SPOT Pro v 4.74, is now available!  Visit SPOT
 home <http://www.daylightinginnovations.com/spot-home>


to learn more about it and download the software.

SPOT Pro is a Windows-based stand-alone lighting and daylighting design
interface to a powerful Radiance ray-tracing engine that sits, accessible,
behind the scenes.  SPOT Pro has a number of unique simulation capabilities:

   - *Optical daylighting system annual simulation* - SPOT uses "system
   BSDF" files to describe these optical or complex fenestration systems and
   perform annual simulation.
   - *Shade control simulation* - both automated/photosensor-based control
   and a range of manual shade control algorithms are available
   - *Annual metric reports* - compare various daylighting metrics with
   standard daylighting reports for LEED (v4, 2009, v2.1), CHPS and a
SPOT performance
   report.
   - *"Design Day" calculations* - results showing average "design day"
   conditions (calibrated to climate data) rather than a specific weather
   condition in an hourly weather file.
   - *Simulation of photosensor systems and electric lighting* - SPOT simulates
   the actual photosensor system response, lets you refine the control system
   settings, and provides an annual simulation of the interaction between
   electric lighting and daylighting.  For those aiming for truly accurate
   simulation of the interaction between daylighting and electric lighting,
   this may be the *only tool* that does not use workplane illuminance (an
   average or a point) as a proxy for the photosensor signals, and that
   accounts for the interaction of electric light feedback on common
   closed-loop control systems.
   - *Output to DOE-2 and EnergyPlus* - After optimization and simulation
   of the photosensor system, SPOT provides annual LPD multiplier schedule
   output files for both DOE-2 and EnergyPlus.  Direct output to HAP coming
   soon....
   - *Internal Geometry Modeler* - The internal modeling tools are fairly
   robust, with blocks, sloped ceilings, monitors, and sawtooth geometries
   available, yet still easy and quick to use with no CAD experience
   necessary.  Sketchup models can be imported into the software behind the
   scenes.
   - *Material Database and Editor * - New material database allows colors,
   patterns, glass, metals, and BSDF files to be assigned to your model's
   surfaces.
   - *Improved Renderings -* The use of materials and patterns greatly
   improve the quality of the perspective and sectional renderings.

The software is in its final weeks of beta testing with the official v5.0
release coming at the end of August, 2015.  Commercial licenses bought
during this final beta stage are 1/2 off and will be valid for all SPOTPro
v5.X releases (at least a 3 year cycle).  Reduced price educational
licenses are also available.

The SPOT user manual
<http://www.manula.com/manuals/zrogers/spot-pro-v-5/1/en/topic/1-0-introduction>

provides detailed information about the software including screen shots of
the various aspects of the program and this SPOT webinar
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecBFe83HRSY> provides a good introduction
to the software.

The next SPOT training webinars will be held at the Radiance workshop in
Philadelphia on August 18, 2015 (register at the workshop website
<http://www.cvent.com/events/14th-annual-international-radiance-workshop/event-summary-9869b51ebebe45ad8cb25fdf2e31fd89.aspx>

)  followed by a Performance.Network webinar on Sept 4, 2015 (register at
performance.network <http://www.performance.network>

).  E-mail spot at daylightinginnovations.com if you are interested in joining
or scheduling a future SPOT webinar.

Happy Simulating!

Moisture Analysis 101 for Building Envelopes

Fri, Aug 14, 2015
12:30 PM - 2:00 PM EDT


DESCRIPTION
Modern buildings typically contain envelope systems that require specific layers to control condensation due to moisture migration and/or air leakage, dedicated waterproofing systems to protect moisture-sensitive backup materials (e.g., wood and gypsum-based products), and thermal insulation to control heat losses and gains. Consequently, building codes include provisions for these systems in new construction, and in some cases, renovation projects. As such, architecture and consulting firms frequently turn to hygrothermal modeling to determine the optimal arrangement of these layers. This presentation will introduce the parameters to consider when setting up a model, and through several project examples, demonstrate how hygrothermal modeling can be used to develop assemblies with a low risk for moisture-related problems. Also, critical to the process, we will touch on some of the limitations and assumptions made when developing a hygrothermal model. The webinar will feature a live demonstration of the WuFi tool.

ABOUT THE SPEAKER
Cheryl Saldanha, PE is a senior engineer with with Simpson Gumpertz & Heger Inc. in New York City. Cheryl specializes in building science and building-envelope performance, including the simulation of heat, air, and moisture migration through assemblies. She investigates building enclosure and mechanical system failures, and designs remedial repairs.

Training in San Francisco, CA September 21-25, 2015


Don't miss this opportunity to be trained in the easiest to use/learn, most powerful building energy performance tool available.


DesignBuilder is an elegant, seamless integration of building energy performance tools encompassing the totality of building energy use, including whole building energy simulation, daylighting and internal/external CFD (computational fluid dynamics).

Suitable for both residential and commercial applications, DesignBuilder was the first graphical user interface (GUI) to EnergyPlus, the 'gold standard' for whole building energy simulation. With more than ten years of development invested, DesignBuilder is the building energy performance tool of choice for today's architects and engineers.

Developed to simplify the process of building simulation, DesignBuilder allows you to rapidly compare the function and performance of building designs and deliver early stage thru final results on time and on budget. Unlike other products that generate results that are broad and indefinite, or do not address daylighting or airflow and 3-D temperature distribution data in and around buildings, DesignBuilder provides a total solution with data results you can have complete confidence in.

The training is suitable for new and experienced users alike. It is fully modular so that people can attend just one or any number of the days. The course is organized so that architects could attend only the first 2-3 days and the last 2 days are specific to engineers. The focus on day 3 is low energy and passive design modelling and it would therefore be valuable for both architects and engineers.

Space is limited so we encourage early registration.

 <http://designbuilderusa.com/training/designbuilder-simulation-training-days> Additional course information and registration.

Are you designing and modeling net zero buildings? What are you waiting for? DesignBuilder is the best software on the market today for that job!

This presentation will provide an overview of the High Performance building design process and show case study of a developer-led Net Zero Energy cost renovation. This process will give the attendees the tools they need to navigate the roles and decisions needed early in the design to result in cost effective solutions. After presenting the process and key performance metrics, we will go step-by-step through a case study design. The case study shows that financial success for the owner/developer can be achieved while resulting in a Net Zero Energy cost building.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] new user feedback sites for EnergyPlus and OpenStudio
Message-ID: <708815EF17FC964494540A87EFA1D1C5CCFFD53B@EFOR-MBX-11.doe.local>

Several months ago, DOE silently migrated the http://energyplus.gov/ and http://openstudio.nrel.gov/ sites to http://energyplus.net/ and http://openstudio.net/. Last week, we launched companion services for both sites. The new services, based on the UserVoice platform, are available via the "Feedback" links on the ribbon of at the top of each site, or directly at http://energyplus.uservoice.com/ and http://openstudio.uservoice.com/. All four sites will use a single sign-on from the energyplus.net domain.

The new user feedback sites are intended as companions to the UnmetHours support site and the GitHub Issues bug-reporting & tracking sites for both projects. They are intended as forums for proposing, discussing, upvoting, and tracking new features and enhancements to EnergyPlus, OpenStudio, and their development and delivery processes. If you have a great idea, big or small, for EnergyPlus or OpenStudio, we want to hear from you.

On behalf of the EnergyPlus and OpenStudio development teams,

-Amir

Subject: [Bldg-sim] achievable accuracy of EnergyPlus or similar programs
Message-ID: <CAOOnEfj30rqoUPUOQJC_xfV4TynWvyaC65J_9jWxeVszdWKNBA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear colleagues,
1. Do you know the maximum number of variables/parameters that could
be applied in EnergyPlus?
2.May be you have got any information about the preliminary calculated
accuracy (uncertainty/error of, for example, room temperature) of this
program?
Human intuition and experience suggest the simple, at first glance, truth. For
a small number of variables, the researcher gets a very rough picture of
the process being studied. In turn, the huge amount of accounted variables
allows deeply and thoroughly to understand the structure of the phenomenon.
However, with the apparent attractiveness, each variable brings its own
error in the integral (theoretical or experimental) error of
model/experiment. Therefore, would seem, must be some optimal/rational
number of variables specific to each of the studied processes.
Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
Best regards
Boris M. Menin

We are pleased to announce the release of the next tools in the Apidae suite
of cost-saving software programs. Apidae Calibrator enables you to
fine-tune your building energy models to ensure that they match your
building?s actual energy usage. Check it out, along with several other free
trials for a limited time at apidaelabs.com <https://apidaelabs.com/http://>

The Apidae suite already includes several individual tools, each of which
solves a major problem engineers confront in designing more efficient
buildings.

*Apidae Accelerator* ? Run large numbers of energy simulations quickly, so
you can spend less time crunching data and more time optimizing your
buildings.

*Apidae Influence* ? Perform sensitivity analyses on your models, to
determine which inputs matter most to your building?s overall performance.

*Apidae Factors* ? Conduct parametric sweeps and exploratory data analysis,
allowing you to focus on the ranges and inputs that interest you, and
explore the results in a dynamic graphical environment.

*Apidae Calibrator* ? Calibrate your models to real-world building data, so
you can make better predictions about your building?s future energy usage.


There are trials available on the website, along with links to blog posts
and demonstration videos. Feel free to try it out. Training and APIs for

Subject: [Bldg-sim] White Box Technologies now releases 2015 weather data
 thru August 18 for over 9, 000 locations worldwide
Message-ID: <55DD918A.2020702@whiteboxtechnologies.com>

White Box Technologies has now made available 2015 weather files through August 18 for 
over 9,150 locations around the world (2162 US, 297 Canadian, 6697 international). Added 
to the weather files previously generated going back to 2001, the WBT Weather web site now 
contains 15-year time series of hourly weather for 6,500 locations, and shorter time 
series for another 3,500 locations. WBT can also create "typical year" weather files for 
any of these locations, although one should check first whether there's already an 
existing TMY3, CWEC2, or IWEC2 weather file.

For a complete list of all 2015 files, please see
http://www.whiteboxtechnologies.com/ISH2015_USACan_locations.txt
or
http://www.whiteboxtechnologies.com/ISH2015_Intern_locations.txt 
<http://www.whiteboxtechnologies.com/ISH2015_Intern_locations.txt> .

To search for a weather file on the WBT Weather web site, please go to: 
http://weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com and use only the "Search by List" option , since 
Google has stopped the "Search by Google Earth" option.

As a special limited offer through the end of the year, WBT can on request fill the 
remaining days of the 2015 files with data from 2014 at no additional cost.  For example, 
if you want a file from July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2015, I can create a file from Jan. 
1 - Jun. 30 of 2015, followed by July 1 - Dec. 31 of 2014.  Please e-mail me for details.

A final note: if you don't find your location of interest on the WBT web site, that 
doesn't mean there's no data , just that the data need further processing or extracted 
from other sources. This is particularly true for North America, where there are at least 
ten times as many personal weather stations as there are official stations. So, if you 
can't find the weather data you want, please send us an e-mail.

	Adjustment
Message-ID: <21BFCB111AFBDC46955BE94E5F37681E1466A40010@HUARD.intranet.MRN.GOUV>

Hello,

With 90.1 2010, I wonder how to apply the fan power limitation pressure drop adjustment formula for an ERV:

(2.2 *  Energy Recovery Effectiveness) - 0.5 in w.c. for each airstream

I don't find example in the 90.1 user's manual about ERV, does the "for each stream" statement apply to the "0.5 in w.c." or to the all formula ?

With a 10,000 cfm ventilation fan and a sensible wheel with a 60% efficiency, what would be the pressure drop adjustment for the ERV?

?         10,000 * ( (2.2 * 0.6 ) - 0.5 * 2) = 3,200 hp


Or


?         10,000 * 2 * ( (2.2 * 0.6 ) - 0.5)=16,400 hp

It's definitively not the same !
Thanks

Hello Julien,
The entire formula is applied to each air stream, on the system, with an energy recovery device other than Runaround Coil.

When calculating A for each device, the flow CFMD, is the flow through the device, not the total system flow.  For example, the flow through an enthalpy wheel might be the only the outdoor air portion of the total system flow.

It?s a good question though.  I can see how the wording might trip you up.

?Fan power adjustment is always on the total CFM and by evaluating
following options in similar line of thought, I feel option:1 is the right
approach because in the option:1 the total CFM remains 10,000 whereas it
doubles ~20,000 ?in option:2.

I hope other experts could chime in and share their experience.

Thank you,

Here is a quick schematic of my project

[cid:image002.jpg at 01D0DFEE.DBFBB0E0]

During design condition (heating and cooling) economiser is off, wheel is on, and OA is at minimum (20% of the supply air). 10,000 cfm ? 20% goes on each stream of the erv.

So based on your last answer the adjustment would be:

?         Adjustement for supply air = 10,000 ? 20% ? ( (2.2 ? 0.6 ) - 0.5 ) = 1 640 hp

?         Adjustement for return air = 10,000 ? 20% ? ( (2.2 ? 0.6 ) - 0.5 ) = 1 640 hp

Adjustments for the ERV would be : 1640 +1640 = 3280 hp

Am I correct ?

Thanks

With a 10,000 cfm ventilation fan and a sensible wheel with a 60% efficiency, what would be the pressure drop adjustment for the ERV?

?         10,000 ? ( (2.2 ? 0.6 ) - 0.5 ? 2) = 3,200 hp


Or


?         10,000 ? 2 ? ( (2.2 ? 0.6 ) - 0.5)=16,400 hp

It?s definitively not the same !

Modeling 101: Energy Modeling for Code Compliance, High Performance
Buildings, and Building Retrofits

Registration Fee: $329 ($132 with NYSERDA discount*)

This eight hour (1 day) training familiarizes building professionals
including architects, engineers, building code officials, and
administrators with the fundamental concepts of whole building energy
simulation, the energy modeling protocols of ASHRAE Standard 90.1, and the
various applications of energy modeling including design optimization,
demonstrating compliance with energy code, LEED certification, incentive
program participation, and documenting federal tax deductions for
commercial buildings.



Modeling 201: eQUEST Energy Modeling for Existing Buildings

Registration Fee: $896 ($358 with NYSERDA discount*)

This sixteen hour (2 day) hands-on training develops the technical skills
necessary for analyzing energy performance of existing buildings through

the accuracy of projected savings from retrofits and identifying cost
effective energy conservation opportunities. The course also covers the
related ASHRAE standards and guidelines.



Modeling 202: eQUEST Energy Modeling for New Construction

Registration Fee: $801 ($320 with NYSERDA discount*)

This sixteen hour (2 day) hands-on training develops the technical skills
necessary for modeling new commercial and multifamily buildings in eQUEST
following the ASHRAE Standard 90.1 Appendix G process, as required by LEED
and many incentive programs. Topics covered include efficient work flow and
productivity strategies, model quality control, and converting available
project data into model inputs.



Modeling 301: Intermediate HVAC Modeling in eQUEST

Registration Fee: $471 ($188 with NYSERDA discount*)

This eight hour (1 day) hands-on training will build on the foundation
established by Modeling 201 or Modeling 202 above, to enhance attendee
modeling skills beyond the beginner level. The focus will be on the most
common air-side HVAC systems and related energy efficiency measures. The
training is applicable to modeling both new and existing buildings.
Additional 300-level classes will be offered in the future on different
topics.



Modeling 302: Water-Side HVAC and High Performance Systems in eQUEST

Registration Fee: $471 ($188 with NYSERDA discount*)

This one-day training covers intermediate and advanced topics in eQUEST

During design condition (heating and cooling) economiser is off, wheel is on, and OA is at minimum (20% of the supply air). 10,000 cfm ? 20% goes on each stream of the erv.

So based on your last answer the adjustment would be:

?         Adjustement for supply air = 10,000 ? 20% ? ( (2.2 ? 0.6 ) - 0.5 ) = 1 640 hp

Adjustments for the ERV would be : 1640 +1640 = 3280 hp

Am I correct ?

Hello Julien,
The entire formula is applied to each air stream, on the system, with an energy recovery device other than Runaround Coil.

When calculating A for each device, the flow CFMD, is the flow through the device, not the total system flow.  For example, the flow through an enthalpy wheel might be the only the outdoor air portion of the total system flow.

It?s a good question though.  I can see how the wording might trip you up.

Julien,

You need to look at the rest of Table 6.5.3.1.1.A to do the calculation.
A = sum of (PD x CFMD/4131)
You do the calculation for each applicable device listed in Table 6.5.3.1.1.B. (As Cory mentioned, you only include the ERV adjustment if the baseline is required to have an ERV.)
For your ERV only, you have ((2.2 x 0.6) ? 0.5) x (10,000 x 0.2)/4131 = 0.397 for each airstream, or 0.794 total.
With no other pressure drop adjustments, A = 0.794.
You then calculate total baseline fan power individually for each system,  = CFMS x 0.00094 + A (for constant volume), using the baseline system supply CFM.
If, for example, the baseline system with energy recovery has 12,000 cfm supply airflow rate, bhp = (12,000 x 0.00094) + 0.794 = 12.074 bhp.
Then Pfan = bhp x 746 / Fan Motor Efficiency, using Table 10.8 for motor efficiency.
You have to split the value for  Pfan between the supply, return, exhaust and relief fans in the baseline in the same proportion as the proposed design.

Hopefully I did that right and didn?t forget anything too important.

Best regards,
~Bill

Here is my understanding of your answer:


?         Yes if the project needs to comply with ECB method or Annex G

?         No if the project needs to comply with the prescriptive path 6.5 : I can use the ERV adjustement even if ERV is not required by article 6.5.6.1.

[cid:image002.jpg at 01D0DFF3.49B7E5A0]


During design condition (heating and cooling) economiser is off, wheel is on, and OA is at minimum (20% of the supply air). 10,000 cfm ? 20% goes on each stream of the erv.

So based on your last answer the adjustment would be:

?         Adjustement for supply air = 10,000 ? 20% ? ( (2.2 ? 0.6 ) - 0.5 ) = 1 640 hp

?         Adjustement for return air = 10,000 ? 20% ? ( (2.2 ? 0.6 ) - 0.5 ) = 1 640 hp

Adjustments for the ERV would be : 1640 +1640 = 3280 hp

Am I correct ?

Hello Julien,
The entire formula is applied to each air stream, on the system, with an energy recovery device other than Runaround Coil.

When calculating A for each device, the flow CFMD, is the flow through the device, not the total system flow.  For example, the flow through an enthalpy wheel might be the only the outdoor air portion of the total system flow.

It?s a good question though.  I can see how the wording might trip you up.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] 90.1 2010 - ERV - Fan Power Limitation Pressure Drop Adjustment

Hello,

With 90.1 2010, I wonder how to apply the fan power limitation pressure drop adjustment formula for an ERV:

(2.2 ?  Energy Recovery Effectiveness) - 0.5 in w.c. for each airstream

I don?t find example in the 90.1 user?s manual about ERV, does the ?for each stream? statement apply to the ?0.5 in w.c.? or to the all formula ?

With a 10,000 cfm ventilation fan and a sensible wheel with a 60% efficiency, what would be the pressure drop adjustment for the ERV?

?         10,000 ? ( (2.2 ? 0.6 ) - 0.5 ? 2) = 3,200 hp


Or


?         10,000 ? 2 ? ( (2.2 ? 0.6 ) - 0.5)=16,400 hp

It?s definitively not the same !
Thanks

Bill,

Wow: my 3280 hp wouldn?t make sense at all?: I was mixed up between the SI and IP version and I forgot to divide by 4131 to find bhp.

So yes, you?re right: regarding only the ERV, adjustment would be 0,794 bhp, which need to be add to the rest of the VAV formula or the CV formula.

Thanks for you clear answer.

Julien,

You need to look at the rest of Table 6.5.3.1.1.A to do the calculation.
A = sum of (PD x CFMD/4131)
You do the calculation for each applicable device listed in Table 6.5.3.1.1.B. (As Cory mentioned, you only include the ERV adjustment if the baseline is required to have an ERV.)
For your ERV only, you have ((2.2 x 0.6) ? 0.5) x (10,000 x 0.2)/4131 = 0.397 for each airstream, or 0.794 total.
With no other pressure drop adjustments, A = 0.794.
You then calculate total baseline fan power individually for each system,  = CFMS x 0.00094 + A (for constant volume), using the baseline system supply CFM.
If, for example, the baseline system with energy recovery has 12,000 cfm supply airflow rate, bhp = (12,000 x 0.00094) + 0.794 = 12.074 bhp.
Then Pfan = bhp x 746 / Fan Motor Efficiency, using Table 10.8 for motor efficiency.
You have to split the value for  Pfan between the supply, return, exhaust and relief fans in the baseline in the same proportion as the proposed design.

Hopefully I did that right and didn?t forget anything too important.

Best regards,
~Bill

If your App G. baseline or Ch 11 Budget Building is required to have an ERV per section 6.5.6.1, then you can apply the pressure drop adjust to your baseline fan power.  If you have an ERV in your design, but it is not required by section 6.5.6.1, then you don?t get to apply the ERV PD to the baseline.  The idea here is the design decision was made that the heating and cooling savings from the ERV outweigh the increase in fan energy, so you don?t get to increase the baseline power because of a design decision that will benefit the proposed.

I would defer to Bill?s message on the details on the calculation as I didn?t go over it thoroughly.

Here is my understanding of your answer:


?         Yes if the project needs to comply with ECB method or Annex G

?         No if the project needs to comply with the prescriptive path 6.5 : I can use the ERV adjustement even if ERV is not required by article 6.5.6.1.

During design condition (heating and cooling) economiser is off, wheel is on, and OA is at minimum (20% of the supply air). 10,000 cfm ? 20% goes on each stream of the erv.

So based on your last answer the adjustment would be:

?         Adjustement for supply air = 10,000 ? 20% ? ( (2.2 ? 0.6 ) - 0.5 ) = 1 640 hp

?         Adjustement for return air = 10,000 ? 20% ? ( (2.2 ? 0.6 ) - 0.5 ) = 1 640 hp

Adjustments for the ERV would be : 1640 +1640 = 3280 hp

Am I correct ?

Hello Julien,
The entire formula is applied to each air stream, on the system, with an energy recovery device other than Runaround Coil.

When calculating A for each device, the flow CFMD, is the flow through the device, not the total system flow.  For example, the flow through an enthalpy wheel might be the only the outdoor air portion of the total system flow.

It?s a good question though.  I can see how the wording might trip you up.

Hello,

With 90.1 2010, I wonder how to apply the fan power limitation pressure drop adjustment formula for an ERV:

(2.2 ?  Energy Recovery Effectiveness) - 0.5 in w.c. for each airstream

I don?t find example in the 90.1 user?s manual about ERV, does the ?for each stream? statement apply to the ?0.5 in w.c.? or to the all formula ?

With a 10,000 cfm ventilation fan and a sensible wheel with a 60% efficiency, what would be the pressure drop adjustment for the ERV?

?         10,000 ? ( (2.2 ? 0.6 ) - 0.5 ? 2) = 3,200 hp


Or


?         10,000 ? 2 ? ( (2.2 ? 0.6 ) - 0.5)=16,400 hp

It?s definitively not the same !
Thanks

Great summary Bill.

Note that if the baseline system includes parallel fan powered boxes, the boxes are to have the default power of 0.35W/cfm.

For those who use eQuest to generate the 90.1-2007 baseline model, only a supply fan is created for each system. You have to add in any return/relief fans and zone exhaust fans as appropriate, splitting the power proportionally to match the proposed case model.

Julien,

You need to look at the rest of Table 6.5.3.1.1.A to do the calculation.
A = sum of (PD x CFMD/4131)
You do the calculation for each applicable device listed in Table 6.5.3.1.1.B. (As Cory mentioned, you only include the ERV adjustment if the baseline is required to have an ERV.)
For your ERV only, you have ((2.2 x 0.6) ? 0.5) x (10,000 x 0.2)/4131 = 0.397 for each airstream, or 0.794 total.
With no other pressure drop adjustments, A = 0.794.
You then calculate total baseline fan power individually for each system,  = CFMS x 0.00094 + A (for constant volume), using the baseline system supply CFM.
If, for example, the baseline system with energy recovery has 12,000 cfm supply airflow rate, bhp = (12,000 x 0.00094) + 0.794 = 12.074 bhp.
Then Pfan = bhp x 746 / Fan Motor Efficiency, using Table 10.8 for motor efficiency.
You have to split the value for  Pfan between the supply, return, exhaust and relief fans in the baseline in the same proportion as the proposed design.

Hopefully I did that right and didn?t forget anything too important.

Best regards,
~Bill

Every so often I receive questions about making your own custom .epw weather file from onsite weather station data.  I haven't done this in a while, so others may have better methods.  However, since I was typing this up anyway, I thought I'd post it.


Tips for making your own weather file for simulation from a weather station:

There are multiple ways to make your own weather file from a weather station, for example, you can use the EnergyPlus Weather Tool.  If you're doing it by hand, here are some tips based on my experience.



1.  Start with an .epw which is as close as possible to your custom file, then revise it with your custom data.


2. Info on what each of the columns in the weather file means can be found in the EnergyPlus user guide.


3. You must convert the timesteps.  If your weather station logs every 5 mins and you're using hourly data in your simulation, you must convert the data.  You'll need to decide how to deal with wind direction, which isn't so easy to average. You could use the dominant wind direction over the hour, or consider each wind direction and speed as a vector and then mathematically combine them, etc.


4. Make sure you're not missing any data entries.  If you have any blanks in the file it won't run.  Out-of-range data will also cause errors.


5.   If there is data that you need in the file but don't have via your weather station, you have multiple options.  Here are some shortcut solutions.  (Yes, I acknowledge that these shortcuts cause inaccuracies.  I recommend doing a sensitivity analysis with high and low values to see if the data really has a big impact on your simulation.  If not, use the shortcut.) A.  You could keep the data from the original .epw file.   B.  You could select some realistic value and use it for every time step.  I do not recommend this approach for solar radiation.  See below.


6.  Unless you have a fancy weather station, you will probably need to convert from global horizontal radiance to indirect and direct normal radiance (and possibly other variables). Multiple people have suggested equations for this based on empirical findings.  Each empirical formula has its own inaccuracies.  I'd recommend picking one that was created based on research in a climate similar to yours.  I've used one from Duffy and Beckman's Solar Engineering of Thermal Processes 1991.


7. Make small changes to the file and run it often, to facility easy debugging.  If you have a problem, also try running portions of the year to pinpoint the problem.


8. In case you don't know how to convert between an Excel file and .epw formats, I wrote the directions below a while back.



Best of luck,

Holly


I'm sure there are a lot of ways to convert between .epw and excel.  This is one
way that works:
1.  Open your EPW as a CSV in Excel.
2.  Make the desired edits, such as plugging in your weather station data.
(Even if you're not using EnergyPlus, the Auxiliary EnergyPlus Programs manual
will explain the components of the EPW file.)
3.  Save the file as a CSV.  I usually save only the header first, deleting the
body.  Then only the body, deleting the header.  Otherwise, you end up with a
lot of extra commas in the header.  This method is quicker than deleting the
commas.
4.  Then I open the files in Textpad or Notepad and combine the header and body
and make sure everything looks OK.  Then save it. CSV or TXT format is fine.
5.  Then I manually change the file name from .txt or .csv to .epw.
6.  Then the EPW file works in EnergyPlus.  I'm assuming it would work in other
programs as well.  As long as all the values are OK I haven't had any problems
with conversions.

As an alternative, you can use the EnergyPlus Weather Tool to compile custom
data into an EPW format.

Hope this helps.

Holly,



Hope all is well with the new family.  We have the pic of the twins on our fridge; well done!



So our department just acquired a Onset weather station (among many other tools).  Of course, now I am looking to generate (or have students generate) EPW files for our use with onsite projects.  I remember you running into numerous pitfalls when you were building the GSD epw file.  Any advice or resources you can recommend?



Thanks in advance.  Curious to see how our elections will turn out.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] deriving shorter timestep data from monthly or annual
Message-ID: <55DF6887.2070909@gmail.com>

Dear all,

I have monthly gas data for a soccer stadium and I'm trying to develop 
it toward daily (or even hourly) data so this can be used in subsequent 
assessments.

My own efforts on previous assessments have extended to relatively crude 
application of multipliers (possibly based on a simulation study) and an 
overall divisor. This is very limited, especially in this case.

In an ideal world, it would be helpful to develop the daily consumption 
weighted with the following factors:

  * Parasitic losses - these can be estimated from when the facility is
    largely closed during the off season
  * Historic game fixtures - readily available from the web
  * Weather, including about 1MW of underpitch heating

I'm surrendered to the possibility that this is well beyond me! But, can 
anybody suggest excel functions or other software tools they may have 
used, or even what math for me to look up on Google?

Many thanks

Chris

Dear Chris,
How about developing a full energy model with a decent amount of measured
data, then calibrating to actual utility data and actual weather?

The underpitch heating is probably a daunting task for any modeling engine;
it would be best to have some sub-meter data for that.  Nonetheless, the
model could become a starting point for understanding daily usage.
Refinements would follow as you get more actual data.

Many years ago, when working for a big university, we sent students around
campus on a several mile trek *every day* to record daily energy use so
that we could regress energy use against daily temperatures.  These days,
it seems that you can save leg power by using BMS data or data logging.
Short of some type of sub-metering or BMS metering, I think it's impossible
to gain a true understanding of what is happening.

Hello Chris,



I think the definitive work on this was done as part of ASHRAE Research project 1404 by Bass Abushakra and Agami Reddy...(see below).

1404-RP
Measurement, Modeling, Analysis and Reporting Protocols for Short-term M&V of Whole Building Energy Performance



Completed January 2014
Milwaukee School of Engineering
Principal Investigator, Bass Abushakra
TC 4.7, Energy Calculations

The objective of this research is to develop a new method to determine the shortest time period for energy use monitoring involving hourly (or sub-hourly) data that will yield reliable and accurate long term energy use estimates within acceptable uncertainty limits. By evaluating the uncertainty in the measured data as the monitoring period progresses, the new method will allow users to evaluate the energy performance and calculate energy savings in commercial and institutional buildings, in a cost-effective short-term monitoring period instead of the current year-long monitoring stipulated in most M&V protocols. The new approach would resolve the problem of needing long-term monitored data, which is often very costly to obtain and/or historically unavailable. In addition, this measurement/extrapolation approach should be designed as simply as possible to meet the uncertainty targets in energy savings stipulated in M&V protocols such as ASHRAE Guideline 14.

Just a thought - You might want to give one of the auto calibration tools a
spin for this one and see what parameter values it comes up with.
