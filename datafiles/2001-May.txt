Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200105221031.AA313256md80000048979@gard.com>



Under research project RP-1015, ASHRAE TC 4.2
has recently completed development of 227 weather
files for energy calculations for international locations--
IWEC (International Weather for Energy Calculations).

The 227 locations are outside the US and Canada
which already have similar data--TMY2 (239 locations)
and CWEC (40+ locations), respectively.  The data format
is an extension of the TMY2 format--with minor changes.

Attached is an excerpt from the final report containing
a list of the locations by country.

A CD-ROM containing the data along with the report
may be available from ASHRAE as soon as the
Annual Meeting late next month in Cincinnati.

(See attached file: IWEC excerpts.PDF)

Dear all,

even if this position may not interest you directly, you may want
to pass it on to your computer wizard friends...

The person we hire will work on the development and maintenance
of IISiBat for TRNSYS, SimCad, and other scientific software
products and online services. The work is fun, the pay is
reasonable and the weather is good !

Thanks,

Werner

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To account for its growing activity in software development, CSTB (The
French Scientific Center for Building Physics) has an opening for a
full-time software developer. CSTB?s software developing team is based in
Sophia Antipolis, France (20 km from Nice). We develop and maintain a set of
scientific software tools and online services (cf. http://software.cstb.fr).
At the same time, the team takes part in European research projects and
conducts consulting missions for our internal and external clients.

You will be involved in the different phases of our projects, from
requirement definition with the internal or external client, to conception,
development and tests.

You should be familiar with Object Oriented design; applying the UML design
method should come naturally to you.

You should have significant practical experience in C++ under WINDOWS. The
ideal candidate would also know JAVA and/or Visual Basic.

Good knowledge of distributed (especially WEB-based) architectures (XML,
SOAP, COM/DCOM, RMI or CORBA) as well as data bases (MySQL or similar) would
be a plus.

Candidates should have a degree in computer science or a related field and
1-2 years of practical experience. Additionally they should have good
communication skills and enjoy teamwork. Basic communication skills in
French or a willingness to acquire them rapidly would be beneficial.

You also must have the necessary mental force to be able to actually work in
a region of France where most people only go for holidays.

Please send your application by email to mailto:werner at cstb.fr

Jose,

Jeff Hirsch's DOE-2 web site has information on weather data for several UK
sites.  The data is in binary format suitable for DOE-2, but can be unpacked
if required.  The following sites are available at
http://doe2.com/Download/Weather/NON-US/, use the uk zip file or txt file to
get the list.  I don't know what format the files are in (TMY/TRY etc).

Please pardon our cross-posts.

ASHRAE Technical Committee (TC) 4.7, Energy Calculations, is evaluating
the results of its research to guide future activities. As part of our
evaluation, we would like to know how the results of our past research
projects have contributed to the HVAC and building communities.
Eighteen research projects have been sponsored (or co-sponsored) by TC
4.7 since 1990. Twelve of the projects are complete and publications
ranging from technical papers to software toolkits have been published
by ASHRAE.

Results of the survey will be presented at the next TC 4.7 meeting
during the ASHRAE Annual Meeting in Cincinnati. The evaluation report
will  be forwarded to ASHRAE Society-level committees for their
consideration in future research policy and funding decisions.

Your input is very important. Please take a few minutes to respond to
the survey. Links to abstracts of papers from the research projects are
provided for your reference.

This survey is not sponsored by ASHRAE headquarters. If you have any
questions or need further information, please contact Vern Smith at
303-444-4149 or by email vsmith at archenergy.com.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200105110809.AA091748md80000045973@gard.com>

I use DOE-21E ver 110 to simulate building energy consumption.  However, I
can't find how to define heating efficiency for PSZ and HVSYS(they have hot
water heating coils).
Can you help me?
Thanks.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200105090748.AA482207md80000045448@gard.com>

Hi,
I have executed a research project with Power-DOE. The analysed building is an office building and I have some troubles with the evaluation of the results. Some values I found are made me suspicious about the accurancy of the analysis. 
I would like somebody to discuss my results, especcially about the building components' effect on total annual energy consumption. ( I am an architect and I especially want to see the architectural elements-building components and passive measurements' effect, on total energy consumption)

Thank you.

Best Regards,
Gulsu Ulukavak

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200105041128.AA282810md80000044312@gard.com>

(apologies for any cross-posting)

IESD has a research studentship for a three-year study in the area of HVAC
system modelling and condition monitoring. The project will involve
developing an existing model of a large (~3MW) HVAC plant which is part of
the Climatic Wind Tunnel facility at the Motor Industry Research
Association, for use on-line to investigate optimal supervisory control and
condition-based maintenance.

The project offers an exciting opportunity to work for a PhD in close
collaboration with a front-line organisation in automotive research. The
studentship provides fees (at UK/EEC rates) together with a stipend at EPSRC
rates (GBP 7,500 p.a. in October 2001).

Applicants should have a good first degree in an appropriate science or
engineering discipline, together with some experience of programming in a
high-level language. Further information on the project or requests for
application forms can be obtained from Professor Vic Hanby.

Colleagues:

You have probably already seen emails or other notices that
EnergyPlus Version 1.0 is available for download at

 http://www.eren.doe.gov/buildings/energy_tools/energyplus

If you have a beta copy, we encourage you to download
Version 1.0.  We no longer are supporting the beta versions.

All the TMY2 weather files have been processed into
EnergyPlus format and should be available for download from
the web site in the next several weeks (currently 15 files
are available). We plan to have a training workshop later
this summer for developers and in early fall for users.  We
plan a half-day workshop just before the ASHRAE meeting in
June (more on that later). We also plan to set up a users
email list and bulletin board by early next month.

There is an amazing amount of interest in EnergyPlus--more
than 1500 people participated in beta testing.  Since
EnergyPlus was released two weeks ago, over 500 people have
already registered their copies of EnergyPlus Version 1.0.

Sincerely,

The EnergyPlus Development, Testing, and Support Team

Symposium on Recent Advances in Energy Simulation

Technical Committee 4.7 on Energy Calculations is organizing
a two-part symposium for the June 2002 ASHRAE meeting on the
subject of recent advances in energy simulation.

The symposium will examine the development of more highly
resolved and accurate methods for modelling the relevant
heat transfer paths in buildings and the energy performance
of HVAC equipment.  Specifically, methods that have been or
that can be incorporated into whole-building simulation
programs will be treated.  The symposium will also consider
the development of validation methodologies and the
validation of whole-building simulation programs.

Interested authors are invited to submit an abstract of
their proposed paper to Ian Beausoleil-Morrison at the
e-mail address shown below.  The abstract should not exceed
500 words and should provide an outline of the paper,
demonstrate the unique contribution, and should clearly
indicate how the paper will relate to the theme "recent
advances in energy simulation". Abstracts should be
submitted in either PDF (preferred) or Word format and must
be received by June 18.  Authors will be notified of
abstract acceptance in early July, following the ASHRAE
summer meeting.

Mailing List Members,

I shut down the BLDG-SIM mailing list about a month ago 
because of problems with our internet connection.  My last 
message telling about that problem caused another problem 
called a "mail loop" which resulted in most of you 
receiving multiple copies of the message.  Our connection 
is still using a standard modem but it appears to be 
working consistently.  

I have tried to reconfigure the mail server software to 
prevent any mail loops from happening again and have tested 
it some on a "dummy" mailing list and some other smaller 
active lists but I won't know for sure until I try this 
message.  Sorry you all have to be guinea pigs.   

If you only receive one copy of this message than the BLDG-
SIM mailing list is working again and you can ask all of 
your questions about building simulation software that you 
have been waiting to ask.  

On the other hand, if you receive multiple copies of this 
message, obviously I don't have things completely working 
yet and I will shut down the list again until I have 
another idea on how to fix it.

Thanks for your continued patience,

Jason
