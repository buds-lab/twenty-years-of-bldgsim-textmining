	Hello All,

	 

	I am using EQUEST to model an office building. I have a 100%
outdoor air ventilation unit which supplies make-up air to the return
side of my FCU's at approx 55 deg. One unit uses energy recovery while
the other does not. Any suggestions on how to simulate this in my EM
would be greatly appreciated.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200611131630.AA3027937pd80001329449@gard.com>

This is an email from Linda Morrison of ambient energy.

Using eQuest, ambient energy is modeling a maintenance bay that has
gas-fired radiant heating, gas-fired make-up air units, direct evaporative
cooling and heat wheel heat recovery.  

I plan on using a System Type of Single Zone with furnace (so I can include
an outside air unit), direct evaporative cooling as a preconditioner, and a
heat wheel heat recovery.  

eQuest Help suggests using a gas fired unit heater to simulate the gas-fired
radiant heating but I can't model this because I cannot add outside air.  

Zone type heating options are furnace, gas fired hydronic, hot water loop?

Suggestions?

Best, 

Linda

Hi Gavin:

Only a guess on the natural gas.

When you set back heating at night, the space cools down to a lower
temperature. When you reinitiate normal heating T-stat setting, you have
to use more energy to get back to space heating equilibrium.

If you have a VAV/hot water reheat, there may also be some reinitiating
in the reheat realm when you go back to normal cooling T-stat settings.

Checking comparative hourly reports on the system level would greatly
assist you.

Hi,

I recently used eQuest s/w to simulate a five-levels building with
several HVAC systems that are servicing different zones at different
levels. I am trying to simulate energy savings by temperature setback
for heating and set forward for cooling in the zones during unoccupied
period. However after running the simulation, energy savings is realized
in the elec but not the NG, instead it went up. Can anyone out there
advise me? I'd appreciate it very much.

We've done several solar absorption cooling analyses in the past couple of years using the TRNSYS program.  The program is ideally suited for this type of analysis.  Give me a call or drop me an e-mail if you'd like to discuss the details of the project or learn more about the software that we used.  Customized versions of the TRNSYS software (nice front-end program that shows the user the parameters of interest and allows them to run simulations, parametric tables etc. for one type of system) can also be created for the application by capable users and freely distributed to project participants.  These deliverable packages can often be created at less cost than a full TRNSYS license and yet still let the user fully investigate the impacts of thermal storage, controls, sizes of equipment, efficiency changes etc.

Good luck with your analysis.

Jeff

Are you sure there is such possibility in the E+? I dont think that you 
can connect the absorption chillers directly with the solar collectors. 
I just had a look in the example files and I didnt find the one you are 
mentioning.

Not sure whether you can model in eQuest but I'm sure there is a way to model it indirectly.  If you want to model it directly by not tweaking the program, download the EnergyPlus program and look at the example file for solar absorption cooling.  The program can handle solar absorption cooling and solar electric energy.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] water side economizer simulation in eQuest
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200611071716.AA1612953pd80001327200@gard.com>

Dear Group,

We are trying to simulate waterside economizer
operation by adding an economizer-type chiller and
associated CHW and CW loops. However we met two
problems -- 

1. cooling tower can only be attached to either
chillers or the waterside economizer. It can't switch
between chillers and the economizer automatically.

2. We are simulating dual duct air conditioning
systes. It seems we can't turn on the waterside
economizer at the air-side systems.

Are there feasible ways in eQuest to simulate
water-side economizer?

Thanks!

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200611071641.AA4144640pd80001327162@gard.com>

Paul:

In the latest release of eQUESt (3.6), you can select heat pump source from either air, water-loop, or ground-loop in the wizard mode, if both the cooling and heating equipments are specified as DX coil. In the schematic design wizard, these input entries are accessible from the first screen; in the design development wizard, these input entries are accessible from the first screen after you select "Edit Selected Air-Side System".

If the heat pump source is selected as ground loop, a dedicated wizard screen for specifying (vertical) close-loop heat exchanger (VGLHE) will be accessible. Parameters associated with VGLHE are categorized into four sections in this screen.  The first section is for specifying parameters of circulation loop connected to VGLHE, including pump configuration, flow control, design loop temperature, etc. The second section is for specifying ground and grout thermal properties as well as years of previous operation of the VGLHE. Thermal conductivity and diffusivity of various type of soil/rock and thermal conductivity of various commonly used grouting materials are provided in build-in databases. Users can either select rock/soil and grout type from the databases or input the thermal properties directly. The third section is for specifying parameters of boreholes, including VGLHE type, configuration, geometry, pipe material and size. Up to 42 different vertical VGLHE configurations are available, including boreholes in a straight line, in the form of L- or U-shaped lines, and as open or filled rectangles. The fourth section is for specifying properties of the fluid circulating though VGLHE. In addition to pure water, aqueous solutions with different concentration of antifreezes can be selected. Detailed on-line help, databases, and design tips for each of the required parameters can be accessed directly from this screen.

More detailed information about the newly enhanced water-loop and ground-loop simulation capability can be found in the DOE-2.2 manual volume 6: New Features (http://doe2.com/download/DOE-22/DOE22Vol6-NewFeatures.pdf)

Hope it helps,

Xiaobing

Fellow Modelers...

I'm currently attempting to find some documentation on or means of modeling Water-to-Air Heat Pumps in eQUEST.  Specifically, I am trying to model ground source heat pumps.  I've looked at the following items, but beyond these I can't seem to find what I seek:

1)  WSHP...If I select a water-source heat pump, the only two modes I find are air- and water-cooled heat pumps that are generating hot and cold water.  As for the water-to-water, I can connect it to a ground-coupled loop, but I'd like a water-to-air.

2) Someone suggested using a water-cooled DX system, which can have the condenser connected to the ground loop, but the heat pump option available for heating is an air-to-air heat pump, not a water-to-air.

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.

Paul

As far as I've ever been able to tell, the two versions of eQuest are
not compatible with each other.  You can add some refrigeration
components to the normal version but if a more complex model is
required, you may need to start over in the Refrigeration version.  I
would like to know if anyone else has suggestions on how to easily enter
basic model geometry and such into the Refrigeration version.

Hi,

 

I have a .inp file, which was exported from Green Building Studio. When
I open this file with eQUEST regular version, there is no error or
warning message shown. I am trying to add on refrigeration system on
this building model, so I opened it with eQUEST refrigeration version. I
got 195 error messages. The errors in .BDL file are of three major
types: 

 

1. space volume undefined

2. glasstype, height, width undefined. 

"If WIN-SPEC-METHOD is GLASS-TYPE-INPUT, then GLASS-TYPE must be
specified."

3. "FREEZING-T in HydLoop-4 has Expression Evaluation Error: Invalid BDL
reference", which I have no idea about. 

 

When I looked at the .BDL created by eQUEST regular version, there is a
space volume defined. I do not quite understand why the two different
versions interprete the building geometry input differently. How should
I proceed with this? 

 

Thanks for your help!

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200611042008.AA0813812pd80001326077@gard.com>

Last time I used window layers (in 2.2 which I understand is the same code carried over from 2.1E) to look at an external operable blind I found the trend in the results to be worrying.  I ran a number of tests with transparent (99% transmission) and open blinds and found the results to be very different, and intuitively in the wrong direction, from a window with no blinds.  I did speak with Jeff Hirsch at the time and we agreed the results were odd though it wasn't conclusive whether there were bugs or not.

When using blinds in window layers I would strongly recommend you review your results (hourly is best) and satisfy yourself that the results are robust.

Has anyone else had similar issues or better yet provide a little clarity on this?
Regards,
Graham

Andrew,

The following is from an email sent out with the announcement of eQuest
V3.6. Hope this helps.

**************************
Water-Loop and Ground Source Heat Pump Enhancements
The ability to model water loop heat pumps , in both ground coupled and
conventional configurations, 
has been greatly enhanced in two major ways:

1.      Water-source heat pump - the PVVT, PVAVS and PSZ systems can
now be specified to be 
water-loop heat pump systems thus allowing all the options of these
SYSTEM TYPEs to be available for 
use in modeling water -loop heat pump configurations (including
variable flow, staged heating and 
cooling, heat recovery, ERV's, as well as sub-zone conditioning and
return air plenum pathways.

I have a design case which uses a condensing boiler for 66% of the heating 
load.  When warranted, purchased heating is staged in.  I can model this in 
DOE2 but I am wondering how the budget case would be modelled.  Any 
experience with this scenario?

You can use DesignBuilder which is very user friendly and uses EnergyPlus
engine. It is not free but you can download
(http://www.designbuildersoftware.com/designbuilder.php) the fully
functional 30 days evaluation copy for this purpose.

Energy plus is also a good alternative. I use it all the time. It is not
as user friendly as some other software, but it might worth learning how
to use it and it is also available for free.

Ecotech has a new version 5.5 and this version has
capability of calculating thermal comfort by
estimating radiant temperatures in a zone. You can
fine more information on the thermal analysis
component at http://squ1.com/ecotect/features/thermal

Hope this helps.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200611011644.AA4432734pd80001324964@gard.com>

I am simulating PVAVS systems in e-QUEST with decoupled tempered 100%
outside ventilation air and fin tube radiators modeled as thermostatically
controlled baseboard heating. The baseboard capacities specified are more
than sufficient to meet what e-QUEST reports as the peak zone heating loads.
The .SIM file reports extensive underheated hours for all systems and hourly
reports show that the zone temperatures never achieve heating setpoint for
much of the occupied period.  Increasing the baseboard capacities by a
factor of 2-3 eliminates the unmet load hours but would not represent the
actual design.

Does anyone know of a way to improve the efficiency of baseboard heat in
e-QUEST so that the specified capacities allow heating loads to be met? Does
anyone have other suggestions for a way around this problem?

Has Ecotect advanced its thermal engine? Or ar the MRT's you mention
generated by Energy+?  When I looked at Ecotect some 2-3 years ago, I
believe it was using a simplified CIBSE method to calculate heat flows.  If
this is still the case the results may be poorer than what you could extract
from DOE-2.2 (if you could extract), which as previously noted would need to
be interpreted with a grain of salt.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200611010225.AA250146pd80001324210@gard.com>

Dear Folks,
 
I am simulating a multi-layer glazing system for a 25-floor office building. The system physically consists of 3 components, the outermost single clear glazing, glass-between blinds, and the innermost double low-e glazing. This configuration has to translate into 7 layers according to the layer-by-layer method in DOE-2.2. After creating applicable codes in the inp file and running the equest interface, I received an error information without simulation results:
"Number of windows w/layers = 40 maximum allowed ..."
 
I set 4 windows for the 4 parameter zones each floor, I still have 100 windows to model. I am wondering if equest allows only 40 windows to be modeled by layer-by-layer method, or I have to run the simulation with DOS batch file. Please advise any solutions.
 
Tons of thanks in advance.
 
Glenn Wu

1.	ERV/HRV is incorporated in HVAC System Parameters.
Double-clicking on the HVAC unit in the Component tree tab will bring up
the Parameters box.  Under the Outside Air Tab there is a category for
Heat Recovery.  However, it should be noted that not all HVAC system
types have the option to add ERV/HRV.
2.	You can tilt exterior walls in the "Detailed Edit" mode although
it could become quite complex to make the various envelope components
meet up correctly.  Coming from the Wizard, all walls are assumed to be
at 90 deg to the horizon.  Typically you could model the walls at 90 deg
unless you are trying to see some benefit with self-shading on the
building, etc.  To my knowledge no curved shapes can be explicitly
modeled in eQUEST.  It is acceptable to simplify curved shapes with
angles.
3.	Again, almost all unique building construction needs to be done
in the "Detailed Edit" mode.  You can eliminate floors, roofs, change
equipment/lighting distribution, etc.

Hello All,

Does anybody know how to do the following in eQuest:

1.	Incorporate ERV/HRV?
2.	Create complex building envelope (angled in vertical type of
wall/ circular wall/trapezoid wall, etc,)? What kind of simplification
can be done?
3.	Create a building with a mezzanine inside?

 

Thank you for your kind attention.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200611301204.AA0456156pd80001336183@gard.com>

You are pretty limited in what you can do here.
 
The Lake/Well condenser water option is only for heat pumps and not for
water cooled chillers.
 
The obvious problem with using a cooling tower and simply setting the
fan energy to zero is you don't get to take advantage of the improved
chiller performance as a result of using colder condenser water.  
 
One work around might be: 
 
Assuming the lake/well is going to supply a pretty constant condenser
water temperature, say 55-60F.  You could try setting up a condenser
loop that always supplies water at a constant temperature say 85F using
a cooling tower with fan energy set to zero.  To capture the improved
performance of the chiller modify the chiller performance curves so that
the performance at 85F matches the expected performance with the
lake/well water at 55F-60F.    
 
This approach should give you a reasonable answer if you calibrate it
correctly.

is a construction called 'Construction.'  I tried deleting the component but
it prompts, "Error loading keyword reference location.'  I also tried to

Virdi,

I have been talking to Songyi of your company for awhile now about providing quality control services for EMSI's energy modelers.  I was referred to EMSI by the developers of IES<VE> to help with the use of the Virtual Environment model but my primary experience is with eQUEST.  I have done quite a bit of one on one training with people on it's use and have taken all of the trainings provided by Marlin Addison as well as assisted with some.  I do not, however, live in Washington D.C. but do have some very good friends who live there and who I would love to visit so I think I could meet your needs fairly cost effectively.  Let me know if you want to pursue this further.

Make the atrium a plenum zone and specify return air for the labs via a
plenum (atrium) you can then heat recover post atrium.  Be careful with the
atrium (sunspace) model as it is a single node model that does not allow for
stratification etc.  Also the solar tracking is somewhat limited.  It will
track the beam through the sunspace and through an internal window facing
the atrium but diffuse and the first bounce of beam are perfectly scattered
with  quasi view factor calculation (I think).

Dear all:

I am modelling a lab building in VisualDOE that has three main areas --
a strip of office space on the west, a strip of lab space on the east,
and a conditioned atrium sandwiched in between the two.  The mechanical
design is such that there is transfer air from the offices to the atrium
and then heat recovery from the atrium to the lab spaces.  However,
VisualDOE cannot model airflow from one zone to another (e.g., from the
offices to the atrium).  Can anyone suggest a way to account for this
transfer air?  Perhaps in the % heat recovery from atrium to lab?

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200611272039.AA3910656pd80001334787@gard.com>

EnergyPlus gives you a greater understanding of comfort by allowing you to output every surface temperature and checking the numbers to make sure asymmetric thermal discomfort doesn't occur.  It also outputs PMV and PPD as well as several other more recent comfort models to give you a better understanding of meeting the criteria established in ASHRAE 55.  

 

Also, EnergyPlus allows you to specify a particular surface that an occupant is closest to such as a floor in a large warehouse or a window surface in a perimeter office space so that its temperature has greater weighting in the PMV calculation.  If you really want to get detailed, look into the free comfort program provided by the "Center for the Built Environment" which will create a PMV chart across the floor surface due to different view factors and thermal asymmetry.  It has a user interface.  

 

Finally, my company has a program called ROOM that analyzes a thermally complex room such as a naturally ventilated atrium space and quickly does all these processes in one program.  It combines a lot of the steps needed to do thermal analysis as well as understanding comfort in one packaged program.  It is available for purchase.  Email me if you are interested.  

 

As Vikram mentioned, RadSim may be a program which can provide the analysis you need.  I've heard of it but have never used it.  I think its free which is always a bonus.  I'd be interested to hear how it works.

Peter,

If your doing PMV calcs, I'm not sure any of the current energy simulation models (energyplus, equest, trace etc) are a good choice. They are lumped node models, and as such average zone temperatures and surface temperatures. Things like MRT depend so much on what position in the room your in. For instance in a 100 ft x 100ft room if you have a west glass facade, with interior walls around it, your PMV 5 feet away from the facade is going to be radically different than that 90 feet away. I would also caution about averaging these values. If you have one end of your room that's too cold, and another that's too hot, your answer will be that every one is comfortable, when in reality no one is. 

 

If your going to be basing a lot of design decisions on this study, I would recommend using a full field solution (like CFD or RadTherm) that will allow you to look at sample MRTs at different points in the room.

heater is 40g, should this one be (42x40) 1680g?

The scavenge air fraction is approx. 50% in Mcycle.
One thought might be to take it as 50% and calculate fan energy separately.


Thanks,

EnergyPlus has model for indirect evaporative cooler than can
approximate the performance of the Coolerado.  It is accessed using the
object called "EvapCooler:InDirect:RDDSpecial".  The model allows web
bulb effectiveness beyond 1.0 with a separate limit for dew point
effectiveness.  What the model does not do is account for the amount of
air spilled out of the main air stream as part of the Maisotsenko cycle.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200611271028.AA2805468pd80001334411@gard.com>

I have a question about the Appendix G baseline model defined in ASHRAE
90.1-2004.

In Table G3.1, it states: "The building shall be modeled so that it does
not shade itself." 

Aside from disabling the self-shading option in the model, does this
mean that shading from adjacent buildings should not be modeled for the
baseline buildings?  Does it matter if the adjacent buildings are part
of the same larger building project?

How was this handled in ASHRAE 90.1-1999, Chapter 11?  Should shading
from adjacent buildings be modeled in either the Proposed or Baseline
models for this version?

Thank you!

Dear Sasa,

ESP-r includes BIPV capabilities, which can also be tied into the 
airflow modelling (for PV hybrid applications) and the electrical 
network (for power flow modelling). Theory and applications can be found 
in the publication on the ESRU website www.esru.strath.ac.uk.

Paul Strachan

Dear all,

I would kindly ask for an information please.
Do ESPr and EnergyPlus include building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV )in
their libraries where thermal interaction of the BIPV and the air in the PV
cavity is considered as well as electrical side?
Something similar to a BIPV component in TRNSYS.

Thanks muchly

The reason why you see single glazed units with U-Values varying from 5.7 to
6.5 W/m2K is due to the varying environmental conditions (and thus film
resistance) the insulation value is nominated at.  I believe your 6.51 is at
winter conitions and thus higher wind speed. Rather than changing the glass
you should change the environmnetal conditions, but i suspect TRNSYS then
calculates its own film coefficients and just looks at the glazed unit
conductivity anyways.

Dear all,

I tried to make a new glazing system for TRNSYS16 with LBNL Window.

purpose:
To make a glazing system that has the U-value, 6.51W/m^2K.

I created a new glass and duplicated the whole data of clear single glass 
in glass library(its ID is 102, generic clear glass). The U-value of the 
glass is 5.912W/m^2K.

I changed U-value of the new glass by changing the conductivity from 
detailed view of glass library. But it only changed slightly(6.023W/m^2K in 
Center of Glass, and 5.833W/m^2K in Total Window), even though I changed 
the value of conductivity (to 1000W/m^2K!).

I set the U-value of the frame 6.51W/m^2K, and the width of the frame 10mm.
Optical characters do not need to change.

What the value I have to change to make the glazing system I desired? 

Thanks in advance

Hello all,

I would kindly ask for an information please regarding the comparison
between ESPr, TRNSYS and EnergyPlus.
I am using TRNSYS. It is user-friendly oriented, components are very well
defined, (including the building Integrated photovoltaics-BIPV).
Based on my short experience with  ESP-r , I understand that ESP-r is
not-user friendly oriented software and does not include BIPV library. It
only has a PV panels where electrical side is considered.
I have not used EnergyPlus and have no experience with it.

In your opinion, what would be  the major strenghts and weaknesses of each
software in therms of accuracy, modeling with BIPV and general impression?

Thank you.
Regards Sasa Pantic

Hi All,
Does anyone have the experience of modeling ECM motors
for either series or parallel Fan-powered VAV boxes in
DOE-2. How does one take advantage for it's capability
to  run efficiently at different RPMs?
Any inputs are highly appreciated.

Regards.
Gerald

Yatin,
   The way the parametric table is designed to work, it generates output 
files for each run, giving them the extensions *.ou1, *.ou2, *.ou3, etc. 
However, it only does so for output files that have the same name as the 
input file (*.dck) itself. If your input file is called MyInput.dck, any 
file that is named MyInput.*** (where *** can be anything you want it to 
be) will be duplicated for each parametric run. If after renaming your 
output files you are still having problems, I would suggest sending the 
input file (and any supporting files) to your distributor so that they can 
have a look.
Cheers,
  David

	Hello All,

	 

	I am using EQUEST to model an office building. I have a 100%
outdoor air ventilation unit which supplies make-up air to the return
side of my FCU's at approx 55 deg. One unit uses energy recovery while
the other does not. Any suggestions on how to simulate this in my EM
would be greatly appreciated.
