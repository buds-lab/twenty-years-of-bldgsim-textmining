Wade,
 
Pharmacia Corp at Skokie, IL had built a new lab using light shelves.  The
company who did the computer modeling is The Weidt Group, Minnetonka,
Minnesota.  Pharmacia is very proud of this new state of art technology
building.  You can contact Steven Schultz at (847) 982-7564 for more
information.

I see from the thread that this question may have gone unanswered in the
past.  I'll give it a try anyway.
 
I know that PowerDOE is not explicitly capable of modeling light shelves for
daylight dimming measures.  However, has anyone had any success manipulating
a model to get reasonable approximations?  I have results from a physical
model that I can use to calibrate my methods, but I'm not sure where to
start.
 
Many thanks in advance for your help.

  Wade,
   
  Look at the method using daylight factors.  Your physical model has to create results for several sun angles and an overcast sky - please refer to the DOE-2 manual for more details.

The 2002 Buildings Energy Databook now is available on-line
at: 

http://buildingsdatabook.eren.doe.gov

In the 2002 version, we have updated and/or enhanced the
existing tables, and added a few new ones.  The Energy
Consumption chapter has been updated with EIA's Annual
Energy Outlook 2002.  New statistics on construction R&D
expenditures (Table 4.5.4) are included in the Economic
chapter.  The Lighting section (Section 5.9) contains
information from U.S. Lighting Market Characterization
completed by Navigant Consulting on behalf of the U.S.
Department of Energy.  The Buildings Profiles chapter has
also been updated and now includes a new section,
Educational Facilities (Section 7.5).

The Buildings Energy Databook and Web site was developed 
for
use within the Department of Energy's Office of Energy
Efficiency and Renewable Energy.  The Databook contains
current buildings-related data and is intended to serve as 
a
resource in providing consistent and citable data, in an
easy to use format.

The Web site provides access to all the tables available in
the hard copy PLUS downloadable versions of tables in both
Excel and PDF formats.  The entire 2002 Buildings Energy
Databook is available electronically for those who register
at the Web site.  Registration enables us to let you know
when new data is available.

The Web site provides the most up to date buildings energy
information and is updated on a regular basis.  For
instance, this year's hard copy will not contain data for
the recently released 1999 Commercial Buildings Energy
Consumption Survey (Energy Information Administration,
2002).  While hard copies of the Databook are available on 
a
limited, first requested basis, the Web site is your best
bet for up-to-date information.  To receive a hardcopy, 
send
an email request to Jordan Kelso <mailto: 
jkelso at drintl.com>
of D&R International. 

We strive to have pertinent and reliable energy data
available from the site and are asking for your assistance. 

Please forward any resources that you believe should be
incorporated in future updates directly to either Sean
McDonald <mailto: sean at pnl.gov> of Pacific Northwest
National Laboratory or Jordan Kelso <mailto:
jkelso at drintl.com>.  Thank you.

Apologies for cross-postings


                        VisualSPARK 1.0.2 RELEASED!

Version 1.0.2 of the VisualSPARK environment for simulation of advanced
building energy systems has just been released. 

For more information or to download the program free of charge please go
to http://SimulationResearch.lbl.gov > VisualSPARK

                            New Features Include:

SPARSE LINEAR SOLUTION METHOD
This method reduces calculation time by orders of magnitude on large
simulation problems with a sparse Jacobian matrix.

AUTOMATIC JACOBIAN REFRESH
An option has been added to automatically recalculate the Jacobian when
needed to ensure robust and fast convergence.

NEW SCALING METHOD
A fully-affine invariant scaling method has been added that makes the
SPARK equation solver less sensitive to cases where the variables have
very different orders of magnitude.

STATISTICS LOG FILE
A log file is produced with information that can be used to "tune" the
solver for optimum performance. Statistics include:
 o  calculation times of linear and nonlinear solver
 o  average sparsity of Jacobian
 o  number of times Jacobian was recalculated

PROBLEM DRIVER API
A problem driver Application Programming Interface (API) has been added
that allows advanced users to:
 o  perform sensitivity analysis
 o  manage and solve multiple problems
 o  retrieve solution values and specify new inputs for a new simulation
      of the same problem
 o  customize the sequence of operations to re-solve the same problem

---------------------------------------------------------------------
SPARK was developed by the Simulation Research Group of Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory and by Ayres Sowell Associates, with
support from the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable
Energy, Office of Building Technology Programs of the U.S. Department of
Energy, program manager Dru Crawley.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] IBPSA regional affiliates
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200209201547.AA474657pd80000195110@gard.com>

The International Building Performance Simulation Association (IBPSA) is

a two-tier organization, with affiliates in a number of countries (see
 http://www.ibpsa.org/regional.htm  ).  We would like to hear from
groups
of individuals interested in starting an IBPSA affiliate organization in

a country or region without an existing affiliate, or from existing
organizations with related missions interested in affiliating with
IBPSA.

IBPSA's mission is to advance and promote the science of building
performance simulation in order to improve the design, construction,
operation, and maintenance of new and existing buildings worldwide.
Regional affiliates engage in a variety of activities to promote
simulation, typically organizing events where practitioners, developers
and researchers can meet and exchange information and ideas and also
addressing national issues such as the use of simulation in building
codes and standards.  IBPSA also runs the biennial Building Simulation
international conference series (the next one is in Eindhoven,
Netherlands in August 2003 - see   http://www.bs2003.tue.nl/  ).  The
local affiliate plays a significant role in organizing the conference
and also shares the proceeds.

Regionalization guidelines, which explain the process of becoming an
IBPSA affiliate can be downloaded from http://www.ibpsa.org/regional.htm
.
Start-up funds, in the form of a loan from IBPSA, can be made available
in cases of need.

If you are interested in starting or becoming and IBPSA affiliate
organization and want more information or would like to discuss the
matter, please contact me or any other member of the Board of Directors
or any of the existing regional affiliates.

A good source to start is couple papers published by Prof. Yan Chen in
ASHRAE Transactions. 
Prof. Chen is also developing the design guideline for displacement
ventilation system for ASHRAE.
 
According to Halton company, Dallas airport being constructed now is using

A good source to start is couple papers published by Prof. Yan Chen in
ASHRAE Transactions. 
Prof. Chen is also developing the design guideline for displacement
ventilation system for ASHRAE.
 
According to Halton company, Dallas airport being constructed now is
using DV too.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] New Report: Review & Comparison of Web- and Disk-based Tools for Residential Energy Analysis
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200209180840.AA405598pd80000193848@gard.com>

An interesting report was recently posted by LBL titled:

  Review & Comparison of Web- and Disk-based Tools
  for Residential Energy Analysis

It can be downloaded at:

  http://eetd.lbl.gov/emills/PUBS/SoftwareReview.html

Here is the abstract:

There exist hundreds of web- and disk-based building energy 
software tools. These tools exhibit considerable range in 
approach and creativity, with some being highly specialized 
and others able to consider the building as a whole. 
However, users are faced with a dizzying array of choices 
and, often, conflicting results. The fragmentation of 
development and deployment efforts has hampered tool 
quality and market penetration. The purpose of this review 
is to provide information for defining the desired 
characteristics of residential energy tools, and to 
encourage future tool development that improves on current 
practice. We evaluated 50 web-based residential 
calculators, and 15 disk-based calculators. The comparison 
shows that some tools require a relatively small number of 
well-considered inputs while others ask a myriad of 
questions and still miss key issues. The value of detail 
has a lot to do with the type of question(s) being asked by 
the user (e.g., the availability of dozens of miscellaneous 
appliances is immaterial for a user attempting to evaluate 
the potential for space-heating savings by installing a new 
furnace). More detail does not, according to our 
evaluation, automatically translate into a ?better? or 
?more accurate? tool. Efforts to quantify and compare the 
"accuracy" of these tools are difficult at best, and prior 
tool-comparison studies have not undertaken this in a 
meaningful way. The ability to evaluate accuracy is 
inherently limited by the availability of measured data. 
Furthermore, certain tool outputs can only be measured 
against ?actual? values that are themselves calculated 
(e.g., HVAC sizing), while others are rarely if ever 
available (e.g., measured energy use or savings for 
specific measures). Similarly challenging is to understand 
the sources of inaccuracies. Many factors conspire to 
confound performance comparisons among tools. Differences 
in inputs can range from weather city, to types of HVAC 
systems, to appliance characteristics, to occupant-driven 
effects such as thermostat management. Differences in 
results would thus no doubt emerge from an extensive 
comparative exercise, but the sources or implications of 
these differences for the purposes of accuracy evaluation 
or tool development would remain largely unidentifiable. 
For the tools that we tested, the predicted energy bills 
for a single test building ranged widely (by nearly a 
factor of three), and far more so at the end-use level. 
Most tools over-predicted energy bills and all over-
predicted consumption. The deviations (over-predictions) we 
observed from actual bills corresponded to up to $1400 per 
year (approx. 250% of the actual bills). Energy savings 
estimates automatically generated by the web-based tools 
varied from $46/year (5% of predicted use) to $625/year 
(52% of predicted use). The estimates reflect widely 
different packages of measures proposed by the tools, and 
thus a diversity of ?messages? sent to users about the 
opportunities for saving energy. Based on spot checks, we 
also discovered a remarkable number of results that suggest 
errors in programming or algorithm accuracy. There are 
numerous potential avenues for improvement of residential 
energy tools. Various important building science issues and 
energy efficiency features cannot be sufficiently well 
evaluated using existing tools. Synthesizing the 
information gathered, we developed best-practice guidelines 
that may be useful to developers of residential-energy 
tools.

Warren,

GeoPraxis recently completed our California Energy Commission (CEC) funded
R&D project to develop a Conceptual Design Energy Analysis Tool (CDEAT)
that links energy analysis capabilities to architectural 3D-CAD
applications. Our brochure on the project can be found at
http://www.greenbuildingstudio.com/cdeat_trifold.pdf, and the final report
for it can be found at http://www.energy.ca.gov/pier/buildings/reports.html

The tool is currently at the beta stage of development, but the CEC, the
leading CAD vendors, and nearly all of the architectural CAD users we have
spoken with are very excited about the technology. This tool is enabled
through our Green Building Studio web site as a web service and uses gbXML
(www.gbxml.org) and SOAP to allow any gbXML-compliant 3D-CAD application to
request energy simulation results.

An exciting feature is that the resulting files produced can be read into
DOE-2.2/eQuest as well as Trane's TRACE 700 application for more detailed
analyses.   We have also tested the application with an early beta version
of the Department of Energy's new EnergyPlus simulation engine.   Over the
next year we plan on conducting a public beta test with several market
leading 3D-CAD applications. Keep an eye on www.greenbuildingstudio.com for
the beta test announcement if you want to participate.

Sincerely,
John F. Kennedy
CTO

One way to do parameteric runs in EneryPlus is with DOS 
batch files and using EPMacro with IMF files.  

The batch files can create the alternative cases using 
lines like this:

  echo ##set1 wallHeight 2 > param.inc
  echo ##set1 wallWidth  10 >> param.inc
  call runeplus  main IL_Chicago_TMY2
  ren main.csv main-2-10.csv

  echo ##set1 wallHeight 3 > param.inc
  echo ##set1 wallWidth  11 >> param.inc
  call runeplus  main IL_Chicago_TMY2
  ren main.csv main-3-11.csv

  echo ##set1 wallHeight 4 > param.inc
  echo ##set1 wallWidth  12 >> param.inc
  call runeplus  main IL_Chicago_TMY2
  ren main.csv main-4-12.csv

The main.imf file would have a line near the top that would 
say:

  ##include param.inc

The IMF file would then use the variables "wallHeight" and 
"wallWidth". 

See the EP documentation for information about macros.  See 
an old DOS book about batch files.

Warren,



Our approach to 3D IFC import is based on the observation that most 3D CAD
models have been - and in the future will be - formulated for other primary
purposes than thermal performance simulation. They are rarely appropriate as
is but an engineer needs to be able to control the mapping between model
spaces and thermal zones. Quite often a more or less manual selection will
be the most practical, e.g. the model may contain all the rooms of a
building and for the thermal model, you want to study perhaps a single floor
or a group of exceptional rooms.



Our thermal tool, IDA Indoor Climate and Energy 3.0, has it own 3D
geometrical modeler into which one may import an IFC 1.5.1 or 2.0 model as a
(3D) "background model". The user then instantiates the individual IFC
spaces or groups of spaces that he or she wishes to study. This has proven
to be a powerful time-saver and has been commercially available for about a
year.



Other information such as constructions may also be imported from the IFC
model, should they be present there. However, this is rarely the case in
today?s practice, where it seems that most 3D models are still defined for a
single purpose, such as making a visualization, rather than being a
generally applicable description of the building. We have seen some pretty
?interesting? 3D models from unaware CAD modelers.



There is a demo session showing a simple case of IFC import on
www.equa.se/ice

Per Sahlin

You can already import building geometry from ArchiCAD into
EnergyPlus.   At the moment you cannot do it from Revit; if Revit indeed
replaces ADT technology and becomes IFC compatible, it will be possible
to do it from Revit (or whatever it will be called) too.  Also at the
moment, you can import some geometry (not always and not all) from ADT
3.3.  You should be able to do it properly when Autodesk releases ADT 4.

To import building geometry from ArchiCAD, do the following:
1. Install IFC import in EnergyPlus (BS Pro COM Server and IFCtoIDF are
bundled).  Be sure that you are installing the *latest* version.
2. Verify that your installation of ArchiCAD includes the appropriate
IFC utility (IFC_200.apx or IFC_2x.apx in ~Add-Ons/Import-Export); if
missing, contact Graphisoft for the latest version.
3. Save your building file in ArchiCAD as IFC_200 or IFC_2X file type.
4. Run the saved IFC file through IFCtoIDF utility (that will generate
building geometry in IDF format).
5. Run the generated IDF file through EnergyPlus to verify building
geometry input - display the resulting DXF file to visually check the
imported geometry.
6. Manually change the default construction types in the generated IDF
file to what you want in the simulation.
7. Build the rest of the IDF file or splice the geometry into an
existing IDF file.

This describes the basic process.  You can do intermittent checks with
other tools (such as Solibri Model Checker) along the way, but that
should come later after you feel at home with this process.

Most likely, this will not work out for you the first time around. 
Since the existing documentation is way short of what it should be (but
eventually will be), you will probably run into problems you will not be
able to solve on your own.  Rather than getting frustrated, please
contact Rob Hitchcock or myself at LBNL (Rob's address is
rjhitchcock at lbl.gov) and we will help you solve them.

Hello!

Looking for help about parametric run in Energy Plus. I want IDF file to be
updated automatically (Changing values of a certain variable in every pass)
and run Simulation. The output file will be updated after every simulation.

Thanks in advance. Regards

Monjur

Hi Warren,

Our tool SimCad is able to read DXF-files. It also has a prototype
connection
to IFC files.

The latest version of SimCAD (to be released before the end of the year)
can be used to quickly develop the reference building simulations for a
LEED certification process.  SimCAD generates a TRNSYS simulation deck,
which can be run from SimCAD using the quick calculation option.  A
special TRNSYS library of wall, roof and window elements has been
developed to conform to the thermal performance requirements of ASHRAE
90.1.

For more information, see

Is anyone familiar with the progress the industry is making towards integrating energy analysis software with some of the leading 3D CAD programs (ArchiCAD, Revit)?
