Patrick,
Here are a few considerations:

1.       Apartments for working people will have low loads during the day and high loads at night.  The offices will have the reverse pattern.  Depending on the actual office schedules, the actual residential occupancy pattern and the ratio of office / residential space, 50% might work very well.  50% may also be rather close to "irresponsible" unless the local population is very tolerant of room temperatures that are a few degrees higher than normal!

2.       Regardless of #1 above, a LEED project should model the building based on the architect and Engineer's "Basis of Design" (BOD) document.  The scheduling and diversity patterns I mention in #1 are not commonly part of a BOD document, but in your case they sound critical.  You should (strongly) request this information!  If you make assumptions that differ from the Engineer's you may spend endless hours trying to reduce unmet cooling load hours (and probably will not get paid for them)

3.       Once you are confident of the schedules that have been assumed by the BOD, you should be able to represent them for the energy model.

Note: Because each apartment has two fan coils, each with a thermostat, you really have two zones.  This may become important for the cooling diversity.

Patrick,

I suspect they didn't assume that the bedroom wasn't cooled at the same time as the living room. They may have assumed that the cooling schedule of the office space is different than the apartments - maybe 8am to 5pm M-F  for the offices and close to the opposite for the apartments. Or they may have determined that the building peak load was 50% of the sum of the individual loads. A more likely scenario would be that the combined affect of both of those might equal 50%.

I don't think it would be acceptable to turn cooling off in half of the apartments even if you did the same thing in the Baseline building. Are you running into issues with the chiller being undersized?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modelling diversity in single zone apartments


Hi all,

I'm modelling a mixed office/residential tower building with 160 apartments in tropical climate, for LEED. The apartments are centrally cooled with fan coil units, in the living room and bedrooms. The design team sized the chiller with a diversity of 0.5, probably assuming that when the occupants are in the living room, they're not cooling the bedrooms or something of the sort.

Given the number of apartments, I modelled each apartment as a single block. I cannot use zone multipliers because of the specific geometry of the building. I have one combined FCU for each apartment, which is of course either on or off. I'm also grouping apartments based on orientation, but that's beside the point.

My question is about an approach to modelling the diversity of use of FCUs in the apartments. With my modelling simplification, I cannot model the diversity of cooling within an apartment. So what would be an acceptable approach?

I can only think of turning cooling off in half of the apartments, though apartments with cooling turned off are occupied and have internal loads. Would a LEED reviewer be ok with such an approach. Or is there a better way?

Thanks,
Patrick

Message-ID: <CAB9_V+R5AbbWMEtUjvKW+VsmJdX-Xyw7OtoWqt4G52GdwTjeQg@mail.gmail.com>

N++ is a building energy modeling interface from ExpertApp based on the
latest version of the EnergyPlus whole-building energy simulation engine
(V8.1).
N++ is built on the principle that building energy modeling should be
intuitive, fast, flexible, and most importantly visual, with a CAD-like
environment that fits in the conventional design process.
N++ allows architects, engineers and energy professionals develop and
manage building energy models in a timely fashion, to analyze multiple
design scenarios through either desktop or cloud-based simulation, and to
inform project decisions.

For more information, please visit: http://www.expertapp.com/npp.php

The main features of N++ are:

-Model creation in CAD-like environment
-3D orbit view and editing of model geometry
-Drag and drop of the main Energy Plus objects
-Import of raster and dxf drawings for fast zone tracing
-EnergyPlus model import and export
-Enhanced parametric analysis and optimization through jEPlus (
http://www.jeplus.org/wiki/doku.php) and GenOpt (
http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/GO/)
-Parallel simulation on desktop computer, local network or cloud services
(currently via JESS server-
http://www.jeplus.org/wiki/doku.php?id=docs:jess_service)
-Case tagging of the objects that allows multiple model versions in the
project (Proposed design, LEED baseline, Code compliance ...)
-Lighting and electric equipment count
-Graphical representation of the simulation results
-SVG viewer for model diagrams
-Enhanced HTML report viewer

Hi,

Thank you all for your answers. I may have confused everyone. The design
team used a diversity of 0.5 for the cooling equipment in the apartments
only. They haven't assumed this for the whole building.

Still, knowing that these are high-end apartments, I'm not entirely
convinced that people will turn cooling off when they don't occupy a space.
But if that's the assumption, I should go with it, right?

I had a look at the high-rise office/apartment model Dru pointed me to.
It's interesting to note that the apartments are modelled as single-zone
with cooling running 100% time and no setback.

So in conclusion, if I want to stick to the assumption of the design team,
I should split the apartment in 2 zones so that the FCUs in bedrooms and
living rooms can have different operation schedules.

Cheers,
Patrick

Hi Patrick,

Another substantial source of diversity to consider, for a large building and assuming a decent thermal envelope, is that in your most extreme after-occupancy/regular operation* cooling case it's likely not every zonal unit in the building would operate simultaneously.  Consider that for a simple square building, no more than 2 wall facades should be getting hit with direct sunlight at any given hour - so in turn the perimeter zones on the other two orientations would have a fraction of their design cooling loads for those hours.

I would NOT level any judgements, but 100% agree you should be collaboratively discussing with the mechanical designers understand how they came to that degree of capacity diversity so that your model matches what they are expecting to see.  You may want to prepare a summary of the current model's behavior/expectations regarding chiller capacity (via an autosizing run) to help marry your sets of assumptions with respect to building occupancy/operation.  As far as LEED rigor is concerned, when it comes to assumptions of design and building operation (whether in the construction documents or not), it's relatively defensible to put forward that you're matching what the engineer of record has determined for the project (whether you're discussing setbacks, setpoints, or anything similar).   Be mindful many such inputs need to be applied to both baseline and proposed models uniformly.

2 systems per apartment sounds correct from the description, and I also agree from some recent experience with a mixed-use building that you'll likely want to have a separate set of occupancy and system operations schedules defined for the residential vs. nonresidential spaces, for reasons already discussed.


Best regards,

~Nick

*Note from an electrical perspective, it is more typically prudent to design capacity for such cases of 100% operation, as every system may in fact need to run simultaneously, particularly after a power outage, when the building is first coming online.  Sometimes BMS programming is set up to limit and/or stage system operation in consideration of electrical service size limitations, however.

Patrick,

I suspect they didn't assume that the bedroom wasn't cooled at the same time as the living room. They may have assumed that the cooling schedule of the office space is different than the apartments - maybe 8am to 5pm M-F  for the offices and close to the opposite for the apartments. Or they may have determined that the building peak load was 50% of the sum of the individual loads. A more likely scenario would be that the combined affect of both of those might equal 50%.

I don't think it would be acceptable to turn cooling off in half of the apartments even if you did the same thing in the Baseline building. Are you running into issues with the chiller being undersized?

Hi all,

I'm modelling a mixed office/residential tower building with 160 apartments in tropical climate, for LEED. The apartments are centrally cooled with fan coil units, in the living room and bedrooms. The design team sized the chiller with a diversity of 0.5, probably assuming that when the occupants are in the living room, they're not cooling the bedrooms or something of the sort.

Given the number of apartments, I modelled each apartment as a single block. I cannot use zone multipliers because of the specific geometry of the building. I have one combined FCU for each apartment, which is of course either on or off. I'm also grouping apartments based on orientation, but that's beside the point.

My question is about an approach to modelling the diversity of use of FCUs in the apartments. With my modelling simplification, I cannot model the diversity of cooling within an apartment. So what would be an acceptable approach?

I can only think of turning cooling off in half of the apartments, though apartments with cooling turned off are occupied and have internal loads. Would a LEED reviewer be ok with such an approach. Or is there a better way?

Thanks,
Patrick

Dear all,

we are looking for user profiles for European residential consumers:
electricity, gas or oil, district heating/cooling.

We want to use then as a basis to map the differences across Europe and to
analyze the impact on the effective primary energy consumption of
households across Europe.

thanks already for any information provided!

Anderson,
I was checking this out recently I don't believe temperature or humidity setpoints are regulated by ASHRAE 90.1 during occupied periods.  I think they primarily limit this through ASHRAE 55 regarding thermal comfort.  Of course ASHRAE standard 55 is often not mandatory but it is certainly good practice.  It goes without saying that several space types such as hospitals and labs have special temperature and humidity requirements that are industry-specific.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Setback Temperature

Dear all,

We are working on a project that has a special occupancy space and we need to determine a setback/setup temperature for moments that the space is not occupied during working hours.

Section 6.4.3.3.2, of ASHRAE 90.1, states that setback temperature must be 13?C or lower, and setup temperature, 32?C or higher. I understand these temperatures are for off-hours.

Are there such limits of setback/setup temperature for working hours? Or is it defined by design?

Indeed, ASHRAE 55 is he relevant standard for thermal comfort; however... While ASHRAE 90.1 does not specify min and max for the temperature setpoints be during occupied hours, it does include requirements for separation of the heating and cooling setpoints to provide an adequate deadband.

Two things:


1.       For the affected climate zones, the wording of the cited section requires controls that allow for setback temperatures in a range large enough to include those temperatures... not those temperatures specifically.  To paraphrase, the controls must allow for a heating setback temperature setpoint anywhere between the occupied heating setpoint and down to 55F (or lower).  Likewise there must be a cooling setback range to include anything between the occupied cooling setpoint and up to 90F (or higher).  The prescriptive requirement is for a minimum range of control, not to define what those setback temperatures actually are.

2.       I agree with Scott: 90.1 does not prescriptively mandate temperature setpoints (for setback or occupied hours).  If you are doing an Appendix G based model, it does require baseline and proposed models to have matching inputs in this regard, however.

So in sum, I'd concur both your design (occupied) and setback temperatures should be determined in accordance with your mechanical design load calculations, which in turn should consider and be informed by owner/climate/industry-specific space conditioning requirements with respect to occupied and unoccupied states.

~Nick

I don't think the issue is the separate rooms. The diversities used by the designer are most likely:


1.       Different profiles  for the E/S/W orientations due to solar load occurring at different times of day - should calculate within energy model

2.       Each FCU is oversized compared to the peak load due to safety factors and rounding up to next size available from the factory - modeled loads should be slightly lower than the entered capacities

3.       Apartments won't be occupied and/or using their appliances all at the same time - this is the tricky one that is up to you to enter in some form

4.       0.5 doesn't seem like a calculated diversity - they may be using prior projects as a guide

However if the thermostats don't have integral occpuancy controls, I wouldn't make an assumption that the residents have turned off any particular thermostat at any time, and you'll have to decide for yourself if that means changing the model to increase the quantity of zones.

You could approximate the intensity of apartment loads by having some on and some off in groups, or all of them on the same schedule using an average amount of internal gain from lights and appliances. If you are having trouble matching the plant capacity of the designers with the model, you should confirm their BOD in terms of calculating the diversity, and what quantity of internal gains they assumed, etc.

Lastly take a look at square feet per ton as a benchmark to see where the plant is coming in. Does it compare with other projects in that area?

Hi,

Thank you all for your answers. I may have confused everyone. The design team used a diversity of 0.5 for the cooling equipment in the apartments only. They haven't assumed this for the whole building.

Still, knowing that these are high-end apartments, I'm not entirely convinced that people will turn cooling off when they don't occupy a space. But if that's the assumption, I should go with it, right?

I had a look at the high-rise office/apartment model Dru pointed me to. It's interesting to note that the apartments are modelled as single-zone with cooling running 100% time and no setback.

So in conclusion, if I want to stick to the assumption of the design team, I should split the apartment in 2 zones so that the FCUs in bedrooms and living rooms can have different operation schedules.

Cheers,
Patrick

Patrick,
Here are a few considerations:

1.       Apartments for working people will have low loads during the day and high loads at night.  The offices will have the reverse pattern.  Depending on the actual office schedules, the actual residential occupancy pattern and the ratio of office / residential space, 50% might work very well.  50% may also be rather close to "irresponsible" unless the local population is very tolerant of room temperatures that are a few degrees higher than normal!

2.       Regardless of #1 above, a LEED project should model the building based on the architect and Engineer's "Basis of Design" (BOD) document.  The scheduling and diversity patterns I mention in #1 are not commonly part of a BOD document, but in your case they sound critical.  You should (strongly) request this information!  If you make assumptions that differ from the Engineer's you may spend endless hours trying to reduce unmet cooling load hours (and probably will not get paid for them)

3.       Once you are confident of the schedules that have been assumed by the BOD, you should be able to represent them for the energy model.

Note: Because each apartment has two fan coils, each with a thermostat, you really have two zones.  This may become important for the cooling diversity.

Patrick,

I suspect they didn't assume that the bedroom wasn't cooled at the same time as the living room. They may have assumed that the cooling schedule of the office space is different than the apartments - maybe 8am to 5pm M-F  for the offices and close to the opposite for the apartments. Or they may have determined that the building peak load was 50% of the sum of the individual loads. A more likely scenario would be that the combined affect of both of those might equal 50%.

I don't think it would be acceptable to turn cooling off in half of the apartments even if you did the same thing in the Baseline building. Are you running into issues with the chiller being undersized?

Hi Anderson,

a few years ago I did some research on thermal comfort and deadbands. In my
PhD, first chapter you can find that. It is also published in Applied
Energy, but the chapter is more elaborate.

Nick, David,

Thanks for your feedback. I can see there's room for sophistication when
wanting to calculate a proper diversity factor! After discussion with the
designers, they confirmed they considered that occupants would not be
cooling all the rooms at once and that 0.5 was not a calculated diversity
but from experience. And thermostats are under the occupants' control.

I would have been a bit more conservative but hopefully the peak load in
apartments will come (shortly) after people leave the office part. I guess
I'll be able to confirm all that once I make progress on the model and see
how much slack the chillers have around that time.

Regards,
Patrick

Great conversation.  

 

One thing I didn't see mentioned in the discussion is the fact you can
diversify the internal loads within the apartment (and office spaces) to
better reflect the engineers "experience" of load diversity.  This will have
a direct effect of reducing peak cooling and would save you having to split
up your apartments into separate zones. 

 

In my experience, more zones does not always equal better results but it
always equals more headaches and a lot more work.    

 

To setup your operating schedules to account for diversity whether it's
within a single zone or across an entire building use a weighted average
approach.   For example, if the connected lighting load in the apartment is
1W/sq.ft. and the living area and the apartments have equal areas and the
lights in each area are never on at the same time then lighting power would
never be more than 0.5W/sq.ft. You would use a maximum value of 0.5 in your
lighting schedule to describe this case.    

 

As Nick pointed out previously your diversified schedules would need to be
the same in both the baseline and proposed models. 

 

Another thing that might help is to try and duplicate the engineers peak
cooling load calc within the model.  I'm not sure what software you're using
but several tools allow you to do a "peak load calculation" for equipment
sizing that is separate from the actual 8760 simulation.  If your tool has
this capability you could setup a design cooling load calculation similar to
what the engineer will do (e.g. using ASHRAE 1% CDT and all internal loads
and occupancy at 100% for the entire day).  With that calculation you can
examine the theoretical building peak cooling load and then compare that to
the actual building cooling load under a diversified operating schedule.
You can then determine whether the 50% diversity is a valid assumption for
this project.

Hi Patrick,

 

Another substantial source of diversity to consider, for a large building
and assuming a decent thermal envelope, is that in your most extreme
after-occupancy/regular operation* cooling case it's likely not every zonal
unit in the building would operate simultaneously.  Consider that for a
simple square building, no more than 2 wall facades should be getting hit
with direct sunlight at any given hour - so in turn the perimeter zones on
the other two orientations would have a fraction of their design cooling
loads for those hours.

 

I would NOT level any judgements, but 100% agree you should be
collaboratively discussing with the mechanical designers understand how they
came to that degree of capacity diversity so that your model matches what
they are expecting to see.  You may want to prepare a summary of the current
model's behavior/expectations regarding chiller capacity (via an autosizing
run) to help marry your sets of assumptions with respect to building
occupancy/operation.  As far as LEED rigor is concerned, when it comes to
assumptions of design and building operation (whether in the construction
documents or not), it's relatively defensible to put forward that you're
matching what the engineer of record has determined for the project (whether
you're discussing setbacks, setpoints, or anything similar).   Be mindful
many such inputs need to be applied to both baseline and proposed models
uniformly.

 

2 systems per apartment sounds correct from the description, and I also
agree from some recent experience with a mixed-use building that you'll
likely want to have a separate set of occupancy and system operations
schedules defined for the residential vs. nonresidential spaces, for reasons
already discussed. 

 

 

Best regards,

 

~Nick

 

*Note from an electrical perspective, it is more typically prudent to design
capacity for such cases of 100% operation, as every system may in fact need
to run simultaneously, particularly after a power outage, when the building
is first coming online.  Sometimes BMS programming is set up to limit and/or
stage system operation in consideration of electrical service size
limitations, however.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Modelling diversity in single zone apartments

 

Hi,

 

Thank you all for your answers. I may have confused everyone. The design
team used a diversity of 0.5 for the cooling equipment in the apartments
only. They haven't assumed this for the whole building.

 

Still, knowing that these are high-end apartments, I'm not entirely
convinced that people will turn cooling off when they don't occupy a space.
But if that's the assumption, I should go with it, right?

 

I had a look at the high-rise office/apartment model Dru pointed me to. It's
interesting to note that the apartments are modelled as single-zone with
cooling running 100% time and no setback.

 

So in conclusion, if I want to stick to the assumption of the design team, I
should split the apartment in 2 zones so that the FCUs in bedrooms and
living rooms can have different operation schedules.

 

Cheers,

Patrick

Patrick,

Here are a few considerations:

1.       Apartments for working people will have low loads during the day
and high loads at night.  The offices will have the reverse pattern.
Depending on the actual office schedules, the actual residential occupancy
pattern and the ratio of office / residential space, 50% might work very
well.  50% may also be rather close to "irresponsible" unless the local
population is very tolerant of room temperatures that are a few degrees
higher than normal!

2.       Regardless of #1 above, a LEED project should model the building
based on the architect and Engineer's "Basis of Design" (BOD) document.  The
scheduling and diversity patterns I mention in #1 are not commonly part of a
BOD document, but in your case they sound critical.  You should (strongly)
request this information!  If you make assumptions that differ from the
Engineer's you may spend endless hours trying to reduce unmet cooling load
hours (and probably will not get paid for them)

3.       Once you are confident of the schedules that have been assumed by
the BOD, you should be able to represent them for the energy model.  

 

Note: Because each apartment has two fan coils, each with a thermostat, you
really have two zones.  This may become important for the cooling diversity.

Patrick,

 

I suspect they didn't assume that the bedroom wasn't cooled at the same time
as the living room. They may have assumed that the cooling schedule of the
office space is different than the apartments - maybe 8am to 5pm M-F  for
the offices and close to the opposite for the apartments. Or they may have
determined that the building peak load was 50% of the sum of the individual
loads. A more likely scenario would be that the combined affect of both of
those might equal 50%.

 

I don't think it would be acceptable to turn cooling off in half of the
apartments even if you did the same thing in the Baseline building. Are you
running into issues with the chiller being undersized?

 

Aaron

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modelling diversity in single zone apartments

 

Hi all,

 

I'm modelling a mixed office/residential tower building with 160 apartments
in tropical climate, for LEED. The apartments are centrally cooled with fan
coil units, in the living room and bedrooms. The design team sized the
chiller with a diversity of 0.5, probably assuming that when the occupants
are in the living room, they're not cooling the bedrooms or something of the
sort.

 

Given the number of apartments, I modelled each apartment as a single block.
I cannot use zone multipliers because of the specific geometry of the
building. I have one combined FCU for each apartment, which is of course
either on or off. I'm also grouping apartments based on orientation, but
that's beside the point.

 

My question is about an approach to modelling the diversity of use of FCUs
in the apartments. With my modelling simplification, I cannot model the
diversity of cooling within an apartment. So what would be an acceptable
approach?

 

I can only think of turning cooling off in half of the apartments, though
apartments with cooling turned off are occupied and have internal loads.
Would a LEED reviewer be ok with such an approach. Or is there a better way?

 

Thanks,

Patrick

Scott, Nick, Leen and Moore,



Thanks for your feedback. Now I have lots of sources to investigate a bit
more.

Thanks Leen for sharing your PhD research. I?ll have a look at it.



My conclusion so far is that there aren?t specific temperature values for
this situation. It?s basically a matter of design.

Hi Mike,

I agree that splitting 160 apartments in 2 is work that I'd rather avoid if
I can! I was originally considering adjusting schedules to represent
diversity. That works ok for internal gains. I have trouble seeing how that
can work for cooling equipment in a single zone apartment; it's either on
or off. Having one zone with diversified internal gains and cooling on is
not the same thing, in terms of energy use, as having 2 zones, one of which
has cooling turned off. But maybe that's ok as long as both proposed and
baseline are the same?

Thanks,
Patrick

I would think as long as you have properly accounted for the diversity via the schedules, the systems should just not run as long because there is less heat to remove from the space.  The only effects you are not capturing is if only one of the apartment zones should be perimeter, but you are grouping both into a single zone that sees the combined load.  That could change how often the core zone would come on versus the perimeter.  At any rate, I think the cycling of the unit on less often should get  you close to showing the diversity effects.

Hi Mike,

I agree that splitting 160 apartments in 2 is work that I'd rather avoid if I can! I was originally considering adjusting schedules to represent diversity. That works ok for internal gains. I have trouble seeing how that can work for cooling equipment in a single zone apartment; it's either on or off. Having one zone with diversified internal gains and cooling on is not the same thing, in terms of energy use, as having 2 zones, one of which has cooling turned off. But maybe that's ok as long as both proposed and baseline are the same?

Thanks,

Great conversation.

One thing I didn't see mentioned in the discussion is the fact you can diversify the internal loads within the apartment (and office spaces) to better reflect the engineers "experience" of load diversity.  This will have a direct effect of reducing peak cooling and would save you having to split up your apartments into separate zones.

In my experience, more zones does not always equal better results but it always equals more headaches and a lot more work.

To setup your operating schedules to account for diversity whether it's within a single zone or across an entire building use a weighted average approach.   For example, if the connected lighting load in the apartment is 1W/sq.ft. and the living area and the apartments have equal areas and the lights in each area are never on at the same time then lighting power would never be more than 0.5W/sq.ft. You would use a maximum value of 0.5 in your lighting schedule to describe this case.

As Nick pointed out previously your diversified schedules would need to be the same in both the baseline and proposed models.

Another thing that might help is to try and duplicate the engineers peak cooling load calc within the model.  I'm not sure what software you're using but several tools allow you to do a "peak load calculation" for equipment sizing that is separate from the actual 8760 simulation.  If your tool has this capability you could setup a design cooling load calculation similar to what the engineer will do (e.g. using ASHRAE 1% CDT and all internal loads and occupancy at 100% for the entire day).  With that calculation you can examine the theoretical building peak cooling load and then compare that to the actual building cooling load under a diversified operating schedule.  You can then determine whether the 50% diversity is a valid assumption for this project.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Modelling diversity in single zone apartments

Nick, David,

Thanks for your feedback. I can see there's room for sophistication when wanting to calculate a proper diversity factor! After discussion with the designers, they confirmed they considered that occupants would not be cooling all the rooms at once and that 0.5 was not a calculated diversity but from experience. And thermostats are under the occupants' control.

I would have been a bit more conservative but hopefully the peak load in apartments will come (shortly) after people leave the office part. I guess I'll be able to confirm all that once I make progress on the model and see how much slack the chillers have around that time.

Regards,
Patrick

Hi Patrick,

Another substantial source of diversity to consider, for a large building and assuming a decent thermal envelope, is that in your most extreme after-occupancy/regular operation* cooling case it's likely not every zonal unit in the building would operate simultaneously.  Consider that for a simple square building, no more than 2 wall facades should be getting hit with direct sunlight at any given hour - so in turn the perimeter zones on the other two orientations would have a fraction of their design cooling loads for those hours.

I would NOT level any judgements, but 100% agree you should be collaboratively discussing with the mechanical designers understand how they came to that degree of capacity diversity so that your model matches what they are expecting to see.  You may want to prepare a summary of the current model's behavior/expectations regarding chiller capacity (via an autosizing run) to help marry your sets of assumptions with respect to building occupancy/operation.  As far as LEED rigor is concerned, when it comes to assumptions of design and building operation (whether in the construction documents or not), it's relatively defensible to put forward that you're matching what the engineer of record has determined for the project (whether you're discussing setbacks, setpoints, or anything similar).   Be mindful many such inputs need to be applied to both baseline and proposed models uniformly.

2 systems per apartment sounds correct from the description, and I also agree from some recent experience with a mixed-use building that you'll likely want to have a separate set of occupancy and system operations schedules defined for the residential vs. nonresidential spaces, for reasons already discussed.


Best regards,

~Nick

*Note from an electrical perspective, it is more typically prudent to design capacity for such cases of 100% operation, as every system may in fact need to run simultaneously, particularly after a power outage, when the building is first coming online.  Sometimes BMS programming is set up to limit and/or stage system operation in consideration of electrical service size limitations, however.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Modelling diversity in single zone apartments

Hi,

Thank you all for your answers. I may have confused everyone. The design team used a diversity of 0.5 for the cooling equipment in the apartments only. They haven't assumed this for the whole building.

Still, knowing that these are high-end apartments, I'm not entirely convinced that people will turn cooling off when they don't occupy a space. But if that's the assumption, I should go with it, right?

I had a look at the high-rise office/apartment model Dru pointed me to. It's interesting to note that the apartments are modelled as single-zone with cooling running 100% time and no setback.

So in conclusion, if I want to stick to the assumption of the design team, I should split the apartment in 2 zones so that the FCUs in bedrooms and living rooms can have different operation schedules.

Cheers,
Patrick

Patrick,
Here are a few considerations:

1.       Apartments for working people will have low loads during the day and high loads at night.  The offices will have the reverse pattern.  Depending on the actual office schedules, the actual residential occupancy pattern and the ratio of office / residential space, 50% might work very well.  50% may also be rather close to "irresponsible" unless the local population is very tolerant of room temperatures that are a few degrees higher than normal!

2.       Regardless of #1 above, a LEED project should model the building based on the architect and Engineer's "Basis of Design" (BOD) document.  The scheduling and diversity patterns I mention in #1 are not commonly part of a BOD document, but in your case they sound critical.  You should (strongly) request this information!  If you make assumptions that differ from the Engineer's you may spend endless hours trying to reduce unmet cooling load hours (and probably will not get paid for them)

3.       Once you are confident of the schedules that have been assumed by the BOD, you should be able to represent them for the energy model.

Note: Because each apartment has two fan coils, each with a thermostat, you really have two zones.  This may become important for the cooling diversity.

Patrick,

I suspect they didn't assume that the bedroom wasn't cooled at the same time as the living room. They may have assumed that the cooling schedule of the office space is different than the apartments - maybe 8am to 5pm M-F  for the offices and close to the opposite for the apartments. Or they may have determined that the building peak load was 50% of the sum of the individual loads. A more likely scenario would be that the combined affect of both of those might equal 50%.

I don't think it would be acceptable to turn cooling off in half of the apartments even if you did the same thing in the Baseline building. Are you running into issues with the chiller being undersized?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modelling diversity in single zone apartments


Hi all,

I'm modelling a mixed office/residential tower building with 160 apartments in tropical climate, for LEED. The apartments are centrally cooled with fan coil units, in the living room and bedrooms. The design team sized the chiller with a diversity of 0.5, probably assuming that when the occupants are in the living room, they're not cooling the bedrooms or something of the sort.

Given the number of apartments, I modelled each apartment as a single block. I cannot use zone multipliers because of the specific geometry of the building. I have one combined FCU for each apartment, which is of course either on or off. I'm also grouping apartments based on orientation, but that's beside the point.

My question is about an approach to modelling the diversity of use of FCUs in the apartments. With my modelling simplification, I cannot model the diversity of cooling within an apartment. So what would be an acceptable approach?

I can only think of turning cooling off in half of the apartments, though apartments with cooling turned off are occupied and have internal loads. Would a LEED reviewer be ok with such an approach. Or is there a better way?

Thanks,
Patrick

Hi Cory,

Well, maybe that was just the assumption I made that needed to be
challenged. I was imagining that the combined cooling equipment in the
single zone, running at part load, would have a different energy use than
one cooling equipment running at full load in one of the two zones, while
the other is off/cycling. Maybe the difference is marginal on equipment of
the size found in apartments?

Thanks,
Patrick

If you had DX equipment, I would be more inclined to agree that the part load performance of a combined unit would result in different energy use.  I think since you have chilled water fan coils, which I assume have valves to modulate flow, the main piece of concern is the fan, and with that size system, I don't think it will make a big difference.  To me the question is, how much will the energy use differ from a fan twice the size running somewhere around half the time versus two fans that are half the size not running coincidently?

Hi Cory,

Well, maybe that was just the assumption I made that needed to be challenged. I was imagining that the combined cooling equipment in the single zone, running at part load, would have a different energy use than one cooling equipment running at full load in one of the two zones, while the other is off/cycling. Maybe the difference is marginal on equipment of the size found in apartments?

Thanks,
Patrick

I would think as long as you have properly accounted for the diversity via the schedules, the systems should just not run as long because there is less heat to remove from the space.  The only effects you are not capturing is if only one of the apartment zones should be perimeter, but you are grouping both into a single zone that sees the combined load.  That could change how often the core zone would come on versus the perimeter.  At any rate, I think the cycling of the unit on less often should get  you close to showing the diversity effects.

Hi Mike,

I agree that splitting 160 apartments in 2 is work that I'd rather avoid if I can! I was originally considering adjusting schedules to represent diversity. That works ok for internal gains. I have trouble seeing how that can work for cooling equipment in a single zone apartment; it's either on or off. Having one zone with diversified internal gains and cooling on is not the same thing, in terms of energy use, as having 2 zones, one of which has cooling turned off. But maybe that's ok as long as both proposed and baseline are the same?

Thanks,

Great conversation.

One thing I didn't see mentioned in the discussion is the fact you can diversify the internal loads within the apartment (and office spaces) to better reflect the engineers "experience" of load diversity.  This will have a direct effect of reducing peak cooling and would save you having to split up your apartments into separate zones.

In my experience, more zones does not always equal better results but it always equals more headaches and a lot more work.

To setup your operating schedules to account for diversity whether it's within a single zone or across an entire building use a weighted average approach.   For example, if the connected lighting load in the apartment is 1W/sq.ft. and the living area and the apartments have equal areas and the lights in each area are never on at the same time then lighting power would never be more than 0.5W/sq.ft. You would use a maximum value of 0.5 in your lighting schedule to describe this case.

As Nick pointed out previously your diversified schedules would need to be the same in both the baseline and proposed models.

Another thing that might help is to try and duplicate the engineers peak cooling load calc within the model.  I'm not sure what software you're using but several tools allow you to do a "peak load calculation" for equipment sizing that is separate from the actual 8760 simulation.  If your tool has this capability you could setup a design cooling load calculation similar to what the engineer will do (e.g. using ASHRAE 1% CDT and all internal loads and occupancy at 100% for the entire day).  With that calculation you can examine the theoretical building peak cooling load and then compare that to the actual building cooling load under a diversified operating schedule.  You can then determine whether the 50% diversity is a valid assumption for this project.

Nick, David,

Thanks for your feedback. I can see there's room for sophistication when wanting to calculate a proper diversity factor! After discussion with the designers, they confirmed they considered that occupants would not be cooling all the rooms at once and that 0.5 was not a calculated diversity but from experience. And thermostats are under the occupants' control.

I would have been a bit more conservative but hopefully the peak load in apartments will come (shortly) after people leave the office part. I guess I'll be able to confirm all that once I make progress on the model and see how much slack the chillers have around that time.

Regards,
Patrick

Hi Patrick,

Another substantial source of diversity to consider, for a large building and assuming a decent thermal envelope, is that in your most extreme after-occupancy/regular operation* cooling case it's likely not every zonal unit in the building would operate simultaneously.  Consider that for a simple square building, no more than 2 wall facades should be getting hit with direct sunlight at any given hour - so in turn the perimeter zones on the other two orientations would have a fraction of their design cooling loads for those hours.

I would NOT level any judgements, but 100% agree you should be collaboratively discussing with the mechanical designers understand how they came to that degree of capacity diversity so that your model matches what they are expecting to see.  You may want to prepare a summary of the current model's behavior/expectations regarding chiller capacity (via an autosizing run) to help marry your sets of assumptions with respect to building occupancy/operation.  As far as LEED rigor is concerned, when it comes to assumptions of design and building operation (whether in the construction documents or not), it's relatively defensible to put forward that you're matching what the engineer of record has determined for the project (whether you're discussing setbacks, setpoints, or anything similar).   Be mindful many such inputs need to be applied to both baseline and proposed models uniformly.

2 systems per apartment sounds correct from the description, and I also agree from some recent experience with a mixed-use building that you'll likely want to have a separate set of occupancy and system operations schedules defined for the residential vs. nonresidential spaces, for reasons already discussed.


Best regards,

~Nick

*Note from an electrical perspective, it is more typically prudent to design capacity for such cases of 100% operation, as every system may in fact need to run simultaneously, particularly after a power outage, when the building is first coming online.  Sometimes BMS programming is set up to limit and/or stage system operation in consideration of electrical service size limitations, however.

Hi,

Thank you all for your answers. I may have confused everyone. The design team used a diversity of 0.5 for the cooling equipment in the apartments only. They haven't assumed this for the whole building.

Still, knowing that these are high-end apartments, I'm not entirely convinced that people will turn cooling off when they don't occupy a space. But if that's the assumption, I should go with it, right?

I had a look at the high-rise office/apartment model Dru pointed me to. It's interesting to note that the apartments are modelled as single-zone with cooling running 100% time and no setback.

So in conclusion, if I want to stick to the assumption of the design team, I should split the apartment in 2 zones so that the FCUs in bedrooms and living rooms can have different operation schedules.

Cheers,
Patrick

Patrick,
Here are a few considerations:

1.       Apartments for working people will have low loads during the day and high loads at night.  The offices will have the reverse pattern.  Depending on the actual office schedules, the actual residential occupancy pattern and the ratio of office / residential space, 50% might work very well.  50% may also be rather close to "irresponsible" unless the local population is very tolerant of room temperatures that are a few degrees higher than normal!

2.       Regardless of #1 above, a LEED project should model the building based on the architect and Engineer's "Basis of Design" (BOD) document.  The scheduling and diversity patterns I mention in #1 are not commonly part of a BOD document, but in your case they sound critical.  You should (strongly) request this information!  If you make assumptions that differ from the Engineer's you may spend endless hours trying to reduce unmet cooling load hours (and probably will not get paid for them)

3.       Once you are confident of the schedules that have been assumed by the BOD, you should be able to represent them for the energy model.

Note: Because each apartment has two fan coils, each with a thermostat, you really have two zones.  This may become important for the cooling diversity.

Patrick,

I suspect they didn't assume that the bedroom wasn't cooled at the same time as the living room. They may have assumed that the cooling schedule of the office space is different than the apartments - maybe 8am to 5pm M-F  for the offices and close to the opposite for the apartments. Or they may have determined that the building peak load was 50% of the sum of the individual loads. A more likely scenario would be that the combined affect of both of those might equal 50%.

I don't think it would be acceptable to turn cooling off in half of the apartments even if you did the same thing in the Baseline building. Are you running into issues with the chiller being undersized?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modelling diversity in single zone apartments


Hi all,

I'm modelling a mixed office/residential tower building with 160 apartments in tropical climate, for LEED. The apartments are centrally cooled with fan coil units, in the living room and bedrooms. The design team sized the chiller with a diversity of 0.5, probably assuming that when the occupants are in the living room, they're not cooling the bedrooms or something of the sort.

Given the number of apartments, I modelled each apartment as a single block. I cannot use zone multipliers because of the specific geometry of the building. I have one combined FCU for each apartment, which is of course either on or off. I'm also grouping apartments based on orientation, but that's beside the point.

My question is about an approach to modelling the diversity of use of FCUs in the apartments. With my modelling simplification, I cannot model the diversity of cooling within an apartment. So what would be an acceptable approach?

I can only think of turning cooling off in half of the apartments, though apartments with cooling turned off are occupied and have internal loads. Would a LEED reviewer be ok with such an approach. Or is there a better way?

Thanks,
Patrick

	baseline sizing
Message-ID: <CAPAgWczrRooPXR_h47ZHHdoGMx9CKpadd8jw=a=3aq2Hf_r5ig@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

When sizing cooling equipment for apartments, the design team on my project
used a worst case scenario approach of maxing out all internal loads. For
instance, lighting would be on during the day, with full occupancy and all
plug equipment running, while the sun is hitting the windows. Adjacent
rooms would be considered without cooling.
For LEED, the sizing for the baseline is based on schedules representing
typical operations for occupancy, lighting, plug, etc. That leads the
baseline to size equipment that has smaller capacity than what considered
for the proposed design.
There's an extra dimension, in the fact the design team sized equipment for
each individual room, reaching their peak load at different times of the
day. So the total cooling capacity is the sum of the worst possible
scenarios. The model currently uses a single zone per apartment, with a not
so worst case scenario.
How do I solve this conundrum? Am I missing something?
Thanks,Patrick

Patrick:

The 50% diversity factor for the residential occupied areas that you describe may or may not be aggressive, though it has the potential to lead to downstream problems involving lawyers. While it may be true you are not 'on the hook' for designing an undersized/underperforming engineered mechanical system design (the engineer of record is holding this bag), you have been presented a hand that if you choose to play forward,  presents you with a great opportunity for showing your chops to the building owner and allows you to demonstrate the true power of hourly quasi-steady state whole building energy simulations to the community that pays our bills.  I've been in residential mixed-use retrofit situations where we have downsized existing chiller capacity by more than 50% (after careful analysis of simulation output using different tools to reach consensus), but in a new construction scenario a carte blanche 50% diversity factor scenario can, if distribution piping is aggressively sized, create some problems for later easily remedying.

Once you determine what kind of internal load peaks (and appropriate time-variant schedules?) were assumed by the owner/design team, if you have the time/budget you might want to incorporate some quick investigation of schedule diversity into your proposed model to determine relative sensitivity against block load vs peak load required proposed chiller tonnage...


Some fodder for providing defendable default residential gain schedules to de-rate/deviate from to test the 50% diversity factor assumption can be found in the recently updated  NREL "Building America House Simulation Protocols" document - updated in December of 2013 but still marked as a draft.  This draft pdf document ships as part of the installation of the free NREL BEopt v2.1.0.0 software - released last week - get it here: https://beopt.nrel.gov/downloadBEopt2



The pdf is filled with loads of simulation tool agnostic assumptions (and supporting documentation) that can be useful for generating input data for residential energy modeling activities.  I hope you find it useful.

Still, knowing that these are high-end apartments, I'm not entirely convinced that people will turn cooling off when they don't occupy a space. But if that's the assumption, I should go with it, right?

I had a look at the high-rise office/apartment model Dru pointed me to. It's interesting to note that the apartments are modelled as single-zone with cooling running 100% time and no setback.

So in conclusion, if I want to stick to the assumption of the design team, I should split the apartment in 2 zones so that the FCUs in bedrooms and living rooms can have different operation schedules.

Cheers,
Patrick

Patrick,
Here are a few considerations:

1.       Apartments for working people will have low loads during the day and high loads at night.  The offices will have the reverse pattern.  Depending on the actual office schedules, the actual residential occupancy pattern and the ratio of office / residential space, 50% might work very well.  50% may also be rather close to "irresponsible" unless the local population is very tolerant of room temperatures that are a few degrees higher than normal!

2.       Regardless of #1 above, a LEED project should model the building based on the architect and Engineer's "Basis of Design" (BOD) document.  The scheduling and diversity patterns I mention in #1 are not commonly part of a BOD document, but in your case they sound critical.  You should (strongly) request this information!  If you make assumptions that differ from the Engineer's you may spend endless hours trying to reduce unmet cooling load hours (and probably will not get paid for them)

3.       Once you are confident of the schedules that have been assumed by the BOD, you should be able to represent them for the energy model.

Note: Because each apartment has two fan coils, each with a thermostat, you really have two zones.  This may become important for the cooling diversity.

Patrick,

I suspect they didn't assume that the bedroom wasn't cooled at the same time as the living room. They may have assumed that the cooling schedule of the office space is different than the apartments - maybe 8am to 5pm M-F  for the offices and close to the opposite for the apartments. Or they may have determined that the building peak load was 50% of the sum of the individual loads. A more likely scenario would be that the combined affect of both of those might equal 50%.

I don't think it would be acceptable to turn cooling off in half of the apartments even if you did the same thing in the Baseline building. Are you running into issues with the chiller being undersized?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modelling diversity in single zone apartments


Hi all,

I'm modelling a mixed office/residential tower building with 160 apartments in tropical climate, for LEED. The apartments are centrally cooled with fan coil units, in the living room and bedrooms. The design team sized the chiller with a diversity of 0.5, probably assuming that when the occupants are in the living room, they're not cooling the bedrooms or something of the sort.

Given the number of apartments, I modelled each apartment as a single block. I cannot use zone multipliers because of the specific geometry of the building. I have one combined FCU for each apartment, which is of course either on or off. I'm also grouping apartments based on orientation, but that's beside the point.

My question is about an approach to modelling the diversity of use of FCUs in the apartments. With my modelling simplification, I cannot model the diversity of cooling within an apartment. So what would be an acceptable approach?

I can only think of turning cooling off in half of the apartments, though apartments with cooling turned off are occupied and have internal loads. Would a LEED reviewer be ok with such an approach. Or is there a better way?

Thanks,
Patrick

Hi Patrick,

I just wanted to clarify for you that Appendix G (G3.1.2.2.1) requires the simulation of sizing runs for equipment selection based on either the peak from the weather file or ASHRAE 99.6% heating and 1% cooling design temperatures.  As far as I know this is not something USGBC or GBCI has written a clarifying rule on for LEED.

As far as being frustrated over engineers doing overly conservative load calculations, welcome to life as an energy analyst.  The best you can hope for is to use simulation to show them and the building owner that they are over engineering the system and try to get some concession.  Ultimately at the end of the day it's the engineer who is stamping the work and taking on the liability that has the final say.

Hi Mike,

I can't say I'm frustrated yet. Just going through the learning curve. I'm
sure frustration will come in time!

I was musing about the potential imbalance in sizing approach between the
proposed design and the baseline design. If we assume for a second that
engineers also use ASHRAE design days when sizing equipment for the
proposed design, there is still a potentially significant difference
between schedules used for sizing and normal operation schedules. Is the
1.15 sizing factor for baseline cooling enough to cover such imbalance? I
don't know enough to say so yet.

Patrick

To be honest, the only potential "overly conservative" sizing I can see
going on here is if the building is served by a central cooling plant and
that plant has been sized based on the sum of the peak loads and not the
peak coincident block load for the building.  If this is in fact how they
sized the system then there is potentially a large cost savings that could
be had by appropriately sizing the central plant.

The "worst case" scenario that you describe is a real scenario that can
happen fairly easily.  All it takes is someone to be at home with their
lights on and appliances running on a peak summer day.  That doesn't seem
like a very unlikely scenario at the zone level.

As for how the Baseline equipment should be sized, it should be no
different in terms of lighting, plug loads, and solar gains.  The only
stipulation on the baseline simulation is that it is oversized by a
prescriptive 25% for heating and 15% for cooling.  ASHRAE 90.1 doesn't
strictly define what a "sizing run" is, but it would be considered standard
practice to utilize the peak lighting and plug loads during your sizing
calculations (i.e. don't assume any diversity on the lights and use the
maximum anticipated coincident plug load value).

HI Patrick,



To play devil's advocate, I'll just put forward none of the practices you're lamenting are unusual or even necessarily a bad idea from a design perspective.



That said, it isn't unusual in my experience for proposed model cooling capacities to sum larger than a baseline model counterpart (and this can quickly become an arbitrary figure when you've got many small systems).  If however you are looking at many magnitudes difference between your models, that in my experience can be a bright red flag to carefully review your model's assumptions of loads & scheduling against the mechanical designer's - you may be missing critical information.



I would also contend LEED & 90.1 together have very little to say regarding equipment sizing methodology - particularly for determing schedules or which loads are to be considered at 0%, 100%, or anything between for determining capacities.  The only related rules that come to mind are the weather items Mike mentions and the basic requirement for the baseline model to match the proposed model generally for all such scheduling inputs.



Your energy modeling software of choice may dictate what degree of control you have in this matter, but I can volunteer that for eQuest/DOE2 a separate set of schedules and weather conditions can be assigned for both heating and cooling design days, independent of normal operation.  These inputs are used on the LOADS side of the simulation and pretty much directly effect the results for system capacity autosizing.  Coming out of the wizards, you'll find by default eQuest assumes "normal" fractional operation schedules are to be used for heating and cooling design days (HDD/CDD).  This at times can be in sharp contrast to the load assumptions used for equipment sizing protocol outside of an annual simulation, and if I were you I'd also consider reviewing such scheduling assumptions with your mechanical designer.

[cid:image001.png at 01CEF197.B330F950]

[cid:image002.png at 01CEF199.83784270]



I'd also reinforce that while energy modeling can inform and provide insight one can't get anywhere else, at the end of the day the burden of such decisions (and the associated liabilities) are in the designer's hands.  I try to convey such information in a way that avoids "butting heads," but there are times someone at the table isn't really there to talk, learn, and consider changing their minds.  You can try your best to make a case, but ultimately you can't make yourself responsible for what other's paychecks are written for.  Done politically, as Mike suggests, you can leverage your expertise to potentially win new design work if that's within your scope of interests, but be careful to avoid burning bridges ;).



Hope that helps a bit!

All,

An under-appreciated aspect of residential loads calculations is 
"swing."  The building and its contents will absorb a lot of energy 
if the air temperature is allowed to rise a few degrees during peak 
events.  Modeling work that I have done in ASHRAE 1199-RP and 
elsewhere shows that tolerating an occasional 3 F temp rise above the 
set point can reduce the required equipment size by up to 35% 
(depending on building mass etc. etc.)

It is excessively conservative for cooling calcs to assume peak 
internal gains coincident with peak outdoor conditions.  On hot 
afternoons, people very rarely cook full turkey dinners with all the 
TVs on.  If they do, let them warm up a little.  Better than paying 
for an oversized system and running it at lower part load all the time.

A major (and perhaps the only significant) distinction between 
residential and non-residential design philosophy is that in non-res 
situations, people are constrained about what they can do to control 
their environment.  In non-res, the worker must stay at his/her desk 
and slave on ... in res, the occupants can close the shades, move out 
of the sun, and decide to barbecue when it is hot.  Much more 
forgiving situation, so it is nuts to double-oversize res cooling 
systems for the worst worst conditions.  In my humble opinion.

All of which relates to actually designing a good system, as opposed 
to doing 90.1 analysis.  The two activities probably have minimal 
overlap at best.

Chip,

What you say makes sense to a point.  I would argue that most Owner's would
expect the system to work under the very conditions you describe as
excessively conservative and if they don't the contractor and engineer will
be hearing about it down the line.  This is something that should be
discussed on a project by project basis, because when presented properly
the Owner can see considerable savings from such a design as long as they
understand the risk they are taking on by accepting the reduced system size.

When selecting a residential unit, I would undersize the cooling capacity
and oversize the heating capacity. The energy use with decreasing cooling
capacity is not directly proportional (about 1 kw/ton at 100% capacity to 3
kw/ton at 20% capacity).  The energy use of a heating system tends to be
directly proportional to the heating load (up to 90% efficiency).  This is
also true for commercial buildings.  Residential unit control is usually
ON-OFF.  It is more comfortable to let the fan and cooling system run
continuously and let the temperature rise a few degrees under extreme
conditions.  150 years ago there was no air conditioning and mankind
survived.

The "worst case" scenario that you describe is a real scenario that can
happen fairly easily.  All it takes is someone to be at home with their
lights on and appliances running on a peak summer day.  That doesn't seem
like a very unlikely scenario at the zone level.  

As for how the Baseline equipment should be sized, it should be no different
in terms of lighting, plug loads, and solar gains.  The only stipulation on
the baseline simulation is that it is oversized by a prescriptive 25% for
heating and 15% for cooling.  ASHRAE 90.1 doesn't strictly define what a
"sizing run" is, but it would be considered standard practice to utilize the
peak lighting and plug loads during your sizing calculations (i.e. don't
assume any diversity on the lights and use the maximum anticipated
coincident plug load value).

I was musing about the potential imbalance in sizing approach between the

engineers also use ASHRAE design days when sizing equipment for the proposed
design, there is still a potentially significant difference between
schedules used for sizing and normal operation schedules. Is the 1.15 sizing
factor for baseline cooling enough to cover such imbalance? I don't know

This statement is a little troubling to me:

"Adjacent rooms would be considered without cooling."


I would suggest that all conditioned spaces be considered conditioned, 
not at ambient temperature, although that is a design decision and must 
be made by the design engineer.

This is a very interesting conversation.

One that could also be held about sizing domestic hot water systems. ASHRAE
also tends to grossly oversize those, based on what I've seen in existing
buildings on projects where they wanted to replace the system. By
monitoring actual flow and doing the ASHRAE calc, it wasn't rare that
ASHRAE recommended double of what was actually needed.

Anyway, I'm sure you are all aware of this, but I feel I must say it anyway
because it's always good to be reminded of the simple things: you should be
careful when applying the statement "undersize the cooling capacity and
oversize the heating capacity" when selecting PTHPs, especially if you end
up with a grossly oversized cooling side. You should select the system
based on the cooling capacity needed anyway (and add an electric resistance
if need be in certain climate zones), unless you really like humidity and
what comes with it. I've witnessed that mistake before and it's not pretty,
especially in a humid climate. If this weak contribution can prevent
someone from making that mistake then it would have been worth it...

Best,
Julien

Description


N++ is a building energy modeling software created to emulate the
architectural and engineering design process. As a front interface for the
highly capable EnergyPlus (v8.1) simulation engine, N++ allows the user to
input project information into the energy simulation in an intuitive,
highly visible fashion that simplifies the energy modeling process for
designers who are new to energy analysis.
During the presentation Mr. Bajic will talk about the new features in N++
version 2014 and demonstrate the construction of an energy model, that will
include various parametric runs and scenarios, collaboration with 3rd party
tools like JEPlus, JESS (http://www.jeplus.org) and GenOpt (
http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/GO/), perform an optimization of the
energy model and talk about how N++ can be utilized for simulation via
cloud services (currently via JESS server).

About the Speaker: Mr. Bajic is a mechanical engineer with over 16 years of
experience in the HVAC industry as a designer, energy modeler and software
developer. His experience is both international and domestic. Mr.Bajic?s
main focus is building software applications that will help architects and
engineers design more efficient buildings as part of an integrated design
process. Mr. Bajic is currently a senior energy engineer at Viridian Energy
& Environmental (a Vidaris company). He is also the founder of the
ExpertApp (www.expertapp.com), a software company that is specialized in

Message-ID: <CAD7gt0V1v--tEb6+qO0CSRZS4B7UKASyjtqNxqJKDhaw9z30vw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone!

It seems to me that to get an output of "Surface inside/outside
temperature" in TAS is not straightforward (not easy). We couldn't figure
out how to get it. Any hint/direction please?

Also can TAS output "Zone Ventilation Volume Flow Rate" or something
similar. We want to check how much air passes from a zone to outdoors
through the "hole" we modeled on a surface.

Thank you in anticipation!

Kind regards,

Hello Group,

 

I am modeling an existing building which could be seen as two buildings
connected by a short hallway.  The quick story on this facility is that
there were two buildings which were connected by hallways at some point, and
are now on the same chilled and hot water systems. I'm having trouble
finding a clear definition in 90.1 which tells me whether I should be
modeling this as one building or two with a shared energy plant.  This is
not a LEED project; I am only interested in a 90.1 interpretation.  

 

Does anyone know of any clarifications, interpretations, or past experience
which could help guide me? 

 

Thanks,

90.1 is flexible to model only one building or as a combined building, the determinant is what the client's purpose is in deciding to have an energy model project completed.

You could obviously model the whole complex with the specific central plant equipment, or else a single building could be modeled using district energy sources for heating and cooling depending on what the goal was for the study.

I agree completely.

Let the scope/purpose of your modeling efforts decide whether modeling both building as one model is going to be beneficial.

>From my experience, the extra work entailed in properly setting up a representative "campus" plan may well be less work than just modeling both buildings, and if in the course of your studies you intend to address efficiency measures applied/unique to both buildings, I expect it will be more efficient and simpler to work within a unified project.

I'm seeing enough typos in my last reply to warrant a re-issue (following)... sorry for any confusion!

I agree completely.

Let the scope/purpose of your modeling efforts determine whether modeling both buildings as one model is going to be preferable.  90.1 leaves this kind of decision up to the modeler.

>From my experience, the extra work entailed in properly setting up (and documenting) a representative "campus" plant can easily become more work than simply modeling both buildings.

90.1 is flexible to model only one building or as a combined building, the determinant is what the client's purpose is in deciding to have an energy model project completed.

You could obviously model the whole complex with the specific central plant equipment, or else a single building could be modeled using district energy sources for heating and cooling depending on what the goal was for the study.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Addition, or Separate Building?

Hello Group,

I am modeling an existing building which could be seen as two buildings connected by a short hallway.  The quick story on this facility is that there were two buildings which were connected by hallways at some point, and are now on the same chilled and hot water systems. I'm having trouble finding a clear definition in 90.1 which tells me whether I should be modeling this as one building or two with a shared energy plant.  This is not a LEED project; I am only interested in a 90.1 interpretation.

Does anyone know of any clarifications, interpretations, or past experience which could help guide me?

Thanks,
Christian

I agree completely.

 

Let the scope/purpose of your modeling efforts decide whether modeling both
building as one model is going to be beneficial.  

 

>From my experience, the extra work entailed in properly setting up a
representative "campus" plan may well be less work than just modeling both
buildings, and if in the course of your studies you intend to address
efficiency measures applied/unique to both buildings, I expect it will be
more efficient and simpler to work within a unified project.

Hi

I would like to add to this discussion, a couple of months ago we had an interesting review comment from LEED on this issue and it has rattled us a little. There is a definition of whether a building is one or two. Off the top of my head I can't remember where it is (sorry for that not terribly useful) but we had a two buildings connected by a corridor all fed with the same boiler and chiller. LEED specifically told us that because it was only connected by a corridor it had to be regarded as two separate buildings. We had to change LEED certifications and redo a huge amount of the energy model in order to split the energy usage in two. I would suggest that you contact LEED to check you are doing the right thing, it will save you hours of pain and money. This is all assuming you are doing LEED, I know that this definition was not in 90.1 it was somewhere else in LEED documentation.

Hi Annie,

This issue you are facing is a LEED issue and it is defined by the
LEED Minimum Program Requirements (Jan 2011), Suplemental Guidance to
the Minimum Program Requirements Rev 2 (Sep 2011), and LEED Aplication
Guide for Multiple Buildings and On-Campus Building Projects (Oct
2011).

The LEED MPR defines a super structure (single buildings) when two
structures are linked by a space other than a corridor or park garage
(maybe regularly occupied space). Therefore you would have to use the
Multiple Buildings and On-Campus rulings and for energy modelling. The
multiple building works as a single LEED certification for a group or
buildings where each building or both buildings combined must comply
with the requirements. On-campus project works in two stages, you get
the site related credits on a first stage and then you may proceed
with the certification of buildings inside the campus.

Regards,
Dionisio Franca
LEED AP EB+OM, ND

All,

Can anyone share their experience with the modified baseline model HVAC description in ASHRAE 90.1 - 2007 and 2010? (copied below)  ASHRAE 90.1-2004 did not require the baseline model for systems 5,6,7 and 8 to have separate HVAC systems per floor and I'd like to hear how people have interpreted this and, if anyone can explain the reasoning for this.

For example, the proposed model of a 15 story office building might have 2 AHUs, one serving the east wing and one serving the west wing.  For the baseline per ASHRAE 90.1-2007 or 2010, will these 2 AHUs be replaced with 15 separate VAV units? Or can the 2 AHUs be kept as long as it satisfies the statement "Floors with identical thermal blocks can be grouped for modeling purposes"?

ASHRAE 90.1 - 2004
G3.1.1 Baseline HVAC System Type and Description.
HVAC systems in the baseline building design shall be based
on usage, number of floors, conditioned floor area, and heating
source as specified in Table G3.1.1A and shall conform

Yes, for ASHRAE 90.1-2007 and 2010 you will have 15 separate VAV AHUs (one per floor) in the baseline.  I'm not sure of the reasoning for the change unless it is simply for standardization of the number of baseline systems.

I ALWAYS model using the "Floors with identical thermal blocks can be grouped for modeling purposes" allowance, as long as it's thermodynamically appropriate.
Same operating schedule on all 15 floors?  Same setpoints?  Same plug loads and lighting?  What difference would it make to model 15 separate air handlers? (none)
One of my assessment criteria is "Can I explain what I did in front of a group of peers and expect that they'll agree with what I did?"  In this case, I think it would be very hard for them to disagree.

I Agree with the interpretation, baseline (5 to 8) should be modelled with
one AHU system per unique floor. If say, the office building had 15
identical floors, then you would have three AHUs. first and last floor
would have different boundary conditions to the rest, so the simplified way
to model the baseline would be One AHU system for the first floor one for
the middle identical floors (with a load multiplier of 13) and one for the
last floor.

The original poster said he didn't have a LEED project, but you are correct that LEED has their own guidance on how to treat buildings and campuses while using 90.1 mostly as-is. Your project may have had unfortunate timing. I don't know if separating the buildings has been strictly enforced before now. Or if some may still pass through in some cases? This is one of the first times that I've heard of it coming up mid-stream as opposed to allowing the project team to help define which case it should use.

Although it seems like a lot of extra work to separate these two buildings for an NC certification, it would be consistent with eventual EB: O&M certification which would be based on separate ENERGY STAR accounts for the two buildings, so I can see the argument in favor.

I would hope that USGBC would allow you to have both buildings in a combined model as long as each had its own heating and cooling loops and electricity meters -- all pertinent energy usage, demand, and cost could be provided to the reviewer even if the model was combined. I think it's a step too far by the reviewers if they forced you to have two separate models.

Hi

I would like to add to this discussion, a couple of months ago we had an interesting review comment from LEED on this issue and it has rattled us a little. There is a definition of whether a building is one or two. Off the top of my head I can't remember where it is (sorry for that not terribly useful) but we had a two buildings connected by a corridor all fed with the same boiler and chiller. LEED specifically told us that because it was only connected by a corridor it had to be regarded as two separate buildings. We had to change LEED certifications and redo a huge amount of the energy model in order to split the energy usage in two. I would suggest that you contact LEED to check you are doing the right thing, it will save you hours of pain and money. This is all assuming you are doing LEED, I know that this definition was not in 90.1 it was somewhere else in LEED documentation.

I agree with the interpretation, paraphrased for clarity's sake:  15 separate baseline systems (one per floor), each with a number of VAV terminal units equal to the number of thermal blocks per floor (one per zone).

I speculate prior to 2007 folks (myself included) would generally match the quantity and arrangement of proposed systems where possible for baseline modeling.  Without the direction of "one per floor" it would mean, all else being equal, two different baseline models could have varying performance based solely on the design of the proposed systems... I speculate the 90.1 committee didn't want the baseline systems to influence/inform actual designs in such a fashion, so they chose to lock down system quantities using the "one per floor" language.  Arbitrary, yeah, but probably has a net effect of making baselines more uniform in performance across projects.  That's my best guess, fwiw.

I would add to Jim/Santiago's multiplier suggestion that while floor/system multipliers are something I'd also expect to use for a 15-story building, assuming you can arrange for identical zoning and so forth, you may find it less work on the documentation/review side of things to model each floor & system separately.  I caution this as I've run into reviewers needing hand-holding to understand what DOE2 system reports should look like when floor multipliers are in play, and I've also found on the front-end that baseline system calculations can become more complex considering the goal to clearly document how you arrived at your answers.  To be fair, more complex calculations for half as many (or fewer) systems in quantity can balance out and may be a wash too.

Food for thought - hope that helps =),

I ALWAYS model using the "Floors with identical thermal blocks can be grouped for modeling purposes" allowance, as long as it's thermodynamically appropriate.
Same operating schedule on all 15 floors?  Same setpoints?  Same plug loads and lighting?  What difference would it make to model 15 separate air handlers? (none)
One of my assessment criteria is "Can I explain what I did in front of a group of peers and expect that they'll agree with what I did?"  In this case, I think it would be very hard for them to disagree.

Yes, for ASHRAE 90.1-2007 and 2010 you will have 15 separate VAV AHUs (one per floor) in the baseline.  I'm not sure of the reasoning for the change unless it is simply for standardization of the number of baseline systems.

All,

Can anyone share their experience with the modified baseline model HVAC description in ASHRAE 90.1 - 2007 and 2010? (copied below)  ASHRAE 90.1-2004 did not require the baseline model for systems 5,6,7 and 8 to have separate HVAC systems per floor and I'd like to hear how people have interpreted this and, if anyone can explain the reasoning for this.

For example, the proposed model of a 15 story office building might have 2 AHUs, one serving the east wing and one serving the west wing.  For the baseline per ASHRAE 90.1-2007 or 2010, will these 2 AHUs be replaced with 15 separate VAV units? Or can the 2 AHUs be kept as long as it satisfies the statement "Floors with identical thermal blocks can be grouped for modeling purposes"?

ASHRAE 90.1 - 2004
G3.1.1 Baseline HVAC System Type and Description.
HVAC systems in the baseline building design shall be based
on usage, number of floors, conditioned floor area, and heating
source as specified in Table G3.1.1A and shall conform
with the system descriptions in Table G3.1.1B.

ASHRAE 90.1 - 2007 and 2010

HVAC systems in the baseline building design shall be based

source as specified in Table G3.1.1A and shall conform

2, 3, and 4, each thermal block shall be modeled with its own
HVAC system. For systems 5, 6, 7, and 8, each floor shall be

Thanks all for your input!

I agree that there isn't much room for interpretation regarding the floor-by-floor, and that the overall energy use between a baseline AHU configuration that isn't floor-by-floor versus one that is, probably won't differ so much-especially for buildings with homogeneous space types (ie all offices). The scenarios in which there might be a slightly bigger difference in annual energy use is for buildings with varied spacetypes and schedules (ie varied hourly power densities) and/or different comfort setpoints across a single floor, which may mean running this 'fictitious' floor-by-floor unit at the lower part of the system efficiency curve.

Does anyone know who added this line? Or how we can find out who wrote it?

I ALWAYS model using the "Floors with identical thermal blocks can be grouped for modeling purposes" allowance, as long as it's thermodynamically appropriate.
Same operating schedule on all 15 floors?  Same setpoints?  Same plug loads and lighting?  What difference would it make to model 15 separate air handlers? (none)
One of my assessment criteria is "Can I explain what I did in front of a group of peers and expect that they'll agree with what I did?"  In this case, I think it would be very hard for them to disagree.

Yes, for ASHRAE 90.1-2007 and 2010 you will have 15 separate VAV AHUs (one per floor) in the baseline.  I'm not sure of the reasoning for the change unless it is simply for standardization of the number of baseline systems.

All,

Can anyone share their experience with the modified baseline model HVAC description in ASHRAE 90.1 - 2007 and 2010? (copied below)  ASHRAE 90.1-2004 did not require the baseline model for systems 5,6,7 and 8 to have separate HVAC systems per floor and I'd like to hear how people have interpreted this and, if anyone can explain the reasoning for this.

For example, the proposed model of a 15 story office building might have 2 AHUs, one serving the east wing and one serving the west wing.  For the baseline per ASHRAE 90.1-2007 or 2010, will these 2 AHUs be replaced with 15 separate VAV units? Or can the 2 AHUs be kept as long as it satisfies the statement "Floors with identical thermal blocks can be grouped for modeling purposes"?

ASHRAE 90.1 - 2004
G3.1.1 Baseline HVAC System Type and Description.
HVAC systems in the baseline building design shall be based
on usage, number of floors, conditioned floor area, and heating
source as specified in Table G3.1.1A and shall conform
with the system descriptions in Table G3.1.1B.

ASHRAE 90.1 - 2007 and 2010
G3.1.1 Baseline HVAC System Type and Description.
HVAC systems in the baseline building design shall be based
on usage, number of floors, conditioned floor area, and heating
source as specified in Table G3.1.1A and shall conform
with the system descriptions in Table G3.1.1B. For systems 1,
2, 3, and 4, each thermal block shall be modeled with its own
HVAC system. For systems 5, 6, 7, and 8, each floor shall be
modeled with a separate HVAC system.  Floors with identical
thermal blocks can be grouped for modeling purposes.

Bldg-sim,
Standards have to provide some direction of how the baseline AHUs are configured.  While surely not perfect, the AHU per floor is the simplest and most sensible solution I have read.  Yes, I know different numbers of systems between two models is a pain in some software.  A one to one correlation with the proposed design often fails, for example when the proposed is zone heat pumps.   You can still overlay your other exceptions based on load intensity, hours of operation etc.    Before you gloss over the differences as negligible based on one homogenous project, remember all of the aspects that are tied to AHU size including fan power, economizer thresholds, and DX cooling efficiency.  On some projects in some locations those are very significant differences.
Happy modeling,

Thanks all for your input!

I agree that there isn't much room for interpretation regarding the floor-by-floor, and that the overall energy use between a baseline AHU configuration that isn't floor-by-floor versus one that is, probably won't differ so much-especially for buildings with homogeneous space types (ie all offices). The scenarios in which there might be a slightly bigger difference in annual energy use is for buildings with varied spacetypes and schedules (ie varied hourly power densities) and/or different comfort setpoints across a single floor, which may mean running this 'fictitious' floor-by-floor unit at the lower part of the system efficiency curve.

Does anyone know who added this line? Or how we can find out who wrote it?

Subject: RE: [Bldg-sim] ASHRAE 90.1 baseline HVAC sytem description

I agree with the interpretation, paraphrased for clarity's sake:  15 separate baseline systems (one per floor), each with a number of VAV terminal units equal to the number of thermal blocks per floor (one per zone).

I speculate prior to 2007 folks (myself included) would generally match the quantity and arrangement of proposed systems where possible for baseline modeling.  Without the direction of "one per floor" it would mean, all else being equal, two different baseline models could have varying performance based solely on the design of the proposed systems... I speculate the 90.1 committee didn't want the baseline systems to influence/inform actual designs in such a fashion, so they chose to lock down system quantities using the "one per floor" language.  Arbitrary, yeah, but probably has a net effect of making baselines more uniform in performance across projects.  That's my best guess, fwiw.

I would add to Jim/Santiago's multiplier suggestion that while floor/system multipliers are something I'd also expect to use for a 15-story building, assuming you can arrange for identical zoning and so forth, you may find it less work on the documentation/review side of things to model each floor & system separately.  I caution this as I've run into reviewers needing hand-holding to understand what DOE2 system reports should look like when floor multipliers are in play, and I've also found on the front-end that baseline system calculations can become more complex considering the goal to clearly document how you arrived at your answers.  To be fair, more complex calculations for half as many (or fewer) systems in quantity can balance out and may be a wash too.

Food for thought - hope that helps =),

I Agree with the interpretation, baseline (5 to 8) should be modelled with one AHU system per unique floor. If say, the office building had 15 identical floors, then you would have three AHUs. first and last floor would have different boundary conditions to the rest, so the simplified way to model the baseline would be One AHU system for the first floor one for the middle identical floors (with a load multiplier of 13) and one for the last floor.

Annie,
You can always certify these buildings together as LEED for Multiple Buildings:
http://www.usgbc.org/resources/leed-application-guide-multiple-buildings-and-campus-building-projects

If they share mechanical plant/equipment, you can put them together in one energy model.  I'm in the comment review phase on a 6 building certification healthcare project.  Two of the hospitals are served by the central plant building (with no other buildings served).  The energy model was performed with both hospital buildings and the central plant building in one model.  The other three buildings are multi-family apartment buildings with stand-alone mechanical equipment.  Those have been modeled individually in separate models.  The Baseline and Proposed energy costs are then all added up for all 4 models to calculate energy cost savings.  This aggregation is performed in a spreadsheet.  This methodology was confirmed with a GBCI CIR beforehand.

If you're certifying multiple buildings together, which it sounds like you are trying to, I've never had problems in the past putting independent buildings in one model (even if they don't share mechanical plant).  Hopefully this doesn't mark an about-face from GBCI on this topic.  The LEED reviewers have gotten better recently about direct communication with the design team.  I recommend you seek clarification from them before proceeding and using lots of hours.

Best of luck,

Hi

I would like to add to this discussion, a couple of months ago we had an interesting review comment from LEED on this issue and it has rattled us a little. There is a definition of whether a building is one or two. Off the top of my head I can't remember where it is (sorry for that not terribly useful) but we had a two buildings connected by a corridor all fed with the same boiler and chiller. LEED specifically told us that because it was only connected by a corridor it had to be regarded as two separate buildings. We had to change LEED certifications and redo a huge amount of the energy model in order to split the energy usage in two. I would suggest that you contact LEED to check you are doing the right thing, it will save you hours of pain and money. This is all assuming you are doing LEED, I know that this definition was not in 90.1 it was somewhere else in LEED documentation.

 Breathing Zone or Outdoor Air Intake
Message-ID: <8A29D97A76074909A9241603F594BCF7@MRENG.local>

Hi,

 

We've received a nice boost in some models in Canada lately as the Proposed
and Baseline designs only need to have the same amount of outdoor air in the
breathing zone under CaGBC Rules.  Meaning that if your baseline design is
VAV Reheat and your proposed design is chilled beam and baseboard heating
then your proposed design will have to condition somewhere in the range of
40% less outdoor air due to higher zone effectiveness and system efficiency.
It makes a lot of sense to me and becomes a significant energy savings
measure.  

 

Is this allowed by the USGBC or by ASHRAE?  I just read in 90.1 in G.3.1.2.5
that "Minimum outdoor air ventilation rates shall be the same for the
proposed and baseline designs."  That doesn't specify whether they mean in
the breathing zone or outdoor air intake but I think most assume it to be
the outdoor air intake.

 

Aaron

Aaron,
ASHRAE 90.1-2007 Addendum bj allows modelers to take energy savings credit for HVAC systems that increase air distribution effectiveness and use demand control ventilation.  This can therefore result in different ventilation rates between Baseline and Proposed models.  USGBC allows modelers to apply any ASHRAE Addenda they want for that version of the standard as long as it is applied uniformly and clearly stated.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Minimum Ventilation Air in Proposed and Baseline - Breathing Zone or Outdoor Air Intake

Hi,

We've received a nice boost in some models in Canada lately as the Proposed and Baseline designs only need to have the same amount of outdoor air in the breathing zone under CaGBC Rules.  Meaning that if your baseline design is VAV Reheat and your proposed design is chilled beam and baseboard heating then your proposed design will have to condition somewhere in the range of 40% less outdoor air due to higher zone effectiveness and system efficiency. It makes a lot of sense to me and becomes a significant energy savings measure.

Is this allowed by the USGBC or by ASHRAE?  I just read in 90.1 in G.3.1.2.5 that "Minimum outdoor air ventilation rates shall be the same for the proposed and baseline designs."  That doesn't specify whether they mean in the breathing zone or outdoor air intake but I think most assume it to be the outdoor air intake.

Scott,

 

Thanks, I see that came out in 2010 so it didn't make it into 90.1-2010.  

 

It allows you to claim credit for having zone effectiveness greater than 1.0
but doesn't allow you to claim system efficiency gains.

 

"Baseline  ventilation  airflow  rates  in  those

zones shall be calculated using the proposed design Ven-

tilation Rate  Procedure  calculation  with  the  following

change only.  Zone air distribution effectiveness shall be

changed to (Ez)=1.0 in each zone having a zone air distri-

bution effectiveness (Ez)>1.0."  

 

So if your Proposed has a DOAS and the Baseline is VAV, the baseline won't
meet Standard 62.

Scott,

I had thought of that addendum but I don't think it applies in your case since it is meant for UFAD/displacement systems. You may be able to show some savings using G3.1.3.13 and saying that the minimum zone airflow rates are higher for the  baseline VAV system since it is not decoupled like your chilled beam/DOAS system. Baseline and proposed would still have the same minimum OA coming into the building but you would need to do a second OA calc to find what the zone minimums would be. I think it makes sense conceptually but I haven't tried it before so not sure if a reviewer would go for it. That being said they are generally pretty good about accepting atypical arguments for energy savings as long as you show your work in a fair amount of detail.

Scott,

Thanks, I see that came out in 2010 so it didn't make it into 90.1-2010.

It allows you to claim credit for having zone effectiveness greater than 1.0 but doesn't allow you to claim system efficiency gains.

"Baseline  ventilation  airflow  rates  in  those
zones shall be calculated using the proposed design Ven-
tilation Rate  Procedure  calculation  with  the  following
change only.  Zone air distribution effectiveness shall be
changed to (Ez)=1.0 in each zone having a zone air distri-
bution effectiveness (Ez)>1.0."

So if your Proposed has a DOAS and the Baseline is VAV, the baseline won't meet Standard 62.

Aaron,
ASHRAE 90.1-2007 Addendum bj allows modelers to take energy savings credit for HVAC systems that increase air distribution effectiveness and use demand control ventilation.  This can therefore result in different ventilation rates between Baseline and Proposed models.  USGBC allows modelers to apply any ASHRAE Addenda they want for that version of the standard as long as it is applied uniformly and clearly stated.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Minimum Ventilation Air in Proposed and Baseline - Breathing Zone or Outdoor Air Intake

Hi,

We've received a nice boost in some models in Canada lately as the Proposed and Baseline designs only need to have the same amount of outdoor air in the breathing zone under CaGBC Rules.  Meaning that if your baseline design is VAV Reheat and your proposed design is chilled beam and baseboard heating then your proposed design will have to condition somewhere in the range of 40% less outdoor air due to higher zone effectiveness and system efficiency. It makes a lot of sense to me and becomes a significant energy savings measure.

Is this allowed by the USGBC or by ASHRAE?  I just read in 90.1 in G.3.1.2.5 that "Minimum outdoor air ventilation rates shall be the same for the proposed and baseline designs."  That doesn't specify whether they mean in the breathing zone or outdoor air intake but I think most assume it to be the outdoor air intake.

Thanks Brendan,

 

This question wasn't for a specific project, it came up because it is
accepted by the CaGBC (in Canada) but didn't seem to be something that the
USGBC or ASHRAE had ruled on.

I have a question regarding motor efficiency, we are on a project that is looking LEED V2.2 certification. We need to install rolling doors, these doors have two motors each one and motors are 2HP. Our LEED assosor told us that the motor should meet ASHRAE 90.1-2004 efficiency. I think they don?t have to meet because they will be used two or three times per day. The manufacturer (Canadian) told us that motors have 75% efficiency, and according to ASHRAE they need to be 84%. 
Do we really need to meet ASHRAE efficiency? is there any way to be exempt? I will say the motors will serve a special purpose and don?t need to meet efficiency. 
Can you help me and see if I really need to comply with efficiency?

It's a book-printing facility, with book binding machine and all.
Yes, I think that will help. What is the details of the paper?

An updated version of EnergyPlusToFMU is now available at
http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/fmu/EnergyPlus/export/index.html

 

EnergyPlusToFMU is a software package written in Python which allows users
to export the building simulation program EnergyPlus version 8.0 or higher 

 

as a Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) for co-simulation using the Functional
Mock-up Interface (FMI) standard version 1.0. This FMU can then be imported
into 

 

a variety of simulation programs that support the import of the Functional
Mock-up Interface for co-simulation. This capability allows for instance to
model the envelope 

 

of a building in EnergyPlus, export the model as an FMU, import and link the
model with an HVAC system model developed in a system simulation tool such
as the Modelica environment Dymola.

Ery, try this?

 

Thermal storage incorporated in the mechanical system for printing works to
offset peak loads

The electrical consumption of a printing works can be reduced by utilising
thermal storage loads. In order to achieve a balance between 100% outdoor
air and conditioned air, different ventilation schemes were compared. The
subsequent cooling load derived from the comparison was further evaluated to
see if a chiller plant together with a thermal storage system would reduce
energy costs.

<Please excuse cross postings>

Following on from the success of our last Design Optimisation Competition (www.designbuilder.co.uk/content/view/135/206/) the ADOPT (www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~adopt/wiki/doku.php) research partners are pleased to announce a new competition which offers the opportunity to use the latest DesignBuilder Optimisation tools to solve a challenging building design problem.

[cid:image002.png at 01CEFB5C.C5D9EE80]<http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~adopt/wiki/doku.php?id=competition:submissions>

The purpose of the competition is to promote awareness of a new breed of optimisation tools which can help with decision making at any stage of the design process. These tools provide powerful techniques for identifying optimal designs that meet potentially conflicting design requirements such as minimising environmental impact while also minimising development costs and at the same time satisfying constraints such as providing minimum levels of occupant comfort.

Prizes will be awarded for the most cost effective and environmentally friendly design meeting a challenging functional and performance specification. The first prize will be 500 GBP cash plus an Advanced Simulation Package. Runner up prizes will also be provided.

The competition is open to all comers including professional consultants, academics and students and we particularly support use of the competition as part of University building energy modelling teaching modules.
Participants will get advance access to the DesignBuilder Optimisation software, which will help give them the best possible chance of winning the competition. Optimisation requires many hundreds of simulations to be carried out to perform an accurate analysis. In DesignBuilder these simulations can be run in parallel on your local machine, on a network server or for the fastest results over the internet on the De Montfort University high performance supercomputer. We expect many participants will take DMU up on their generous offer to use this powerful resource at no cost during the competition.

A free Webinar will be held on 14 January 2014 at 15:00 GMT to provide more detailed information on the competition and also on the new DesignBuilder Optimisation tools. Whether you are interested in taking part in the competition, or you would just like to know more about the latest optimisation tools, you are warmly invited to attend.

Anyone could explain what is the different between gbXML and Functional
Mock-up Interface (FMI) which for me it seems they are doing the same
exchange of model physical/internal information!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] DES Option 1 Pump Power
Message-ID: <01D1D17822CC9A42A183AFD8AF282D39E2941A9295@wattsexch.wattsae.local>

Hello, I am reviewing an energy model and associated LEED comment for a DES project that is modeled using Option 1 (stand-alone scenario), there is no specific reference to pump power within the guidance document.  The LEED comment states:

"Since the project follows the DES guidance Option 1, only the Baseline secondary distribution loop from Appendix G, with the relevant pump and loop parameters from that secondary loop must be modeled. Additionally, since the distribution loop for hot water is a primary-only loop that includes both upstream and downstream equipment, this option is not available for purchased steam or hot water, and the Baseline Case hot water pumps must be modeling identically in the Baseline and Proposed Cases based on the Proposed Case values.

I believe the directive here is to model the baseline pumps identical to the proposed and equal to the proposed values.  The LEED review comment states that the loop includes upstream equipment when Option 1 is specifically to exclude upstream equipment and model stand-alone.  The energy source is purchased heat.

I think the problem is that I see that the steam coils in the roof-top units are modeled in the same loop as the HW terminal units.  If I separate these into two loops I should be able to claim energy savings for the pump power associated with the HW terminal units.  Is this correct or is it still required to model the HW terminal unit pump power identical in baseline and proposed cases?
Thank you.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Fan power when changing baseline system per LEED
	District Energy rules
Message-ID: <CAOyQK8bXNBK14DkDhjCqUd=afmgppuwP=9OaYuPU9Kr-GSYRXw@mail.gmail.com>

I'm modeling a multifamily building that uses a campus plant for cooling.
I'm familiar with the USGBC document for modeling DES plants, and am
currently looking at Option 1, which is an energy neutral purchased chilled
water plant. Because the building is residential, the normal baseline
system is System 1-PTAC. The USGBC document says to change this to a 4-pipe
fan coil in order to make use of the purchased chilled water. Fair enough.

My problem is how to calculate fan power for this new baseline system. FCUs
are not a normal baseline system, so there's no direction in Appendix G.
Has anyone come across this before? If so, what did you do to calculate the
fan power?

For what it's worth, I see three options:
1) Since I'm replacing System 1, use the formula for System 1,
Pfan=CFMs*0.3. The resulting fan power is much lower than my proposed,
which is a bummer, though it's primarily due to 5 DOAS fans that of course
aren't in the baseline.

2) Allow TRACE to calculate the fan power using its built-in 90.1 features.
This number comes out much higher than the proposed fan power, which is
what tipped me off to this issue. I'm currently trying to back out how
Trace arrived at the fan power it did.

3) The proposed building uses fan coils. Since the new baseline also does,
set the fan powers equal and only receive credit from reduced run hours due
to improved envelope and such. This sounds like a nice way to guarantee
reviewer comments.

Any thoughts?

Thanks,

Message-ID: <CAOyQK8aK2ULeqr-rbO7S3cgm+Zu3YUorgpejgUAEnvevyuR83w@mail.gmail.com>

Regarding my earlier question, Trane TRACE is using the formula for CAV
Systems 3-4 when calculating 90.1 fan power with FCU as the baseline
system. In my case, I'm seeing a large benefit because the formula includes
motor efficiency, which is only 82.5% for most of the small single room
FCUs.

This gets me the most EAc1 points, so I am with only modest shame leaning
towards this approach. Does using this formula seem reasonable enough to
others in the modeling community?

Jason,

I would say that applies to fan power, so your Baseline FCUs should use the System 1 fan power Pfan(w)=CFMS*0.3.

Kevin,
Here's my interpretation of the LEED comment: An Option 1 heating loop is equivalent to a primary loop upstream with a secondary loop downstream. However, Appendix G requires heating loops to be modeled as primary-only. The baseline pump power allowance is based on a primary loop only, and there is no way (according to the LEED comment) to separate the primary loop pump power (which is excluded) from the secondary loop pump power. Therefore, the reviewer wants to see identical heating loop pump power in baseline and proposed.
However, in your case, your district/campus loop is a steam loop which you could argue has no pump power, which could potentially justify modeling 19W/gpm for the baseline heating loop and your actual separate steam and HW loops (from a steam-to-HW heat exchanger, correct?) in the proposed. Unless you get a more thorough review comment or find a CIR explaining it better, I would try that approach and explain it in detail with the revised submission.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] DES Option 1 Pump Power

Hello, I am reviewing an energy model and associated LEED comment for a DES project that is modeled using Option 1 (stand-alone scenario), there is no specific reference to pump power within the guidance document.  The LEED comment states:

"Since the project follows the DES guidance Option 1, only the Baseline secondary distribution loop from Appendix G, with the relevant pump and loop parameters from that secondary loop must be modeled. Additionally, since the distribution loop for hot water is a primary-only loop that includes both upstream and downstream equipment, this option is not available for purchased steam or hot water, and the Baseline Case hot water pumps must be modeling identically in the Baseline and Proposed Cases based on the Proposed Case values.

I believe the directive here is to model the baseline pumps identical to the proposed and equal to the proposed values.  The LEED review comment states that the loop includes upstream equipment when Option 1 is specifically to exclude upstream equipment and model stand-alone.  The energy source is purchased heat.

I think the problem is that I see that the steam coils in the roof-top units are modeled in the same loop as the HW terminal units.  If I separate these into two loops I should be able to claim energy savings for the pump power associated with the HW terminal units.  Is this correct or is it still required to model the HW terminal unit pump power identical in baseline and proposed cases?
Thank you.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Fan power when changing baseline system per LEED District Energy rules


I'm modeling a multifamily building that uses a campus plant for cooling. I'm familiar with the USGBC document for modeling DES plants, and am currently looking at Option 1, which is an energy neutral purchased chilled water plant. Because the building is residential, the normal baseline system is System 1-PTAC. The USGBC document says to change this to a 4-pipe fan coil in order to make use of the purchased chilled water. Fair enough.
My problem is how to calculate fan power for this new baseline system. FCUs are not a normal baseline system, so there's no direction in Appendix G. Has anyone come across this before? If so, what did you do to calculate the fan power?
For what it's worth, I see three options:
1) Since I'm replacing System 1, use the formula for System 1, Pfan=CFMs*0.3. The resulting fan power is much lower than my proposed, which is a bummer, though it's primarily due to 5 DOAS fans that of course aren't in the baseline.
2) Allow TRACE to calculate the fan power using its built-in 90.1 features. This number comes out much higher than the proposed fan power, which is what tipped me off to this issue. I'm currently trying to back out how Trace arrived at the fan power it did.
3) The proposed building uses fan coils. Since the new baseline also does, set the fan powers equal and only receive credit from reduced run hours due to improved envelope and such. This sounds like a nice way to guarantee reviewer comments.
Any thoughts?
Thanks,

Jason,
If the DOAS fan power is what is driving you over the top on your proposed
model, how are you dealing with outside air in the baseline?  If the added
energy consumption for the FCU's handling all of the OA without heat
recovery in the baseline is not offsetting the DOAS fan power then look at
how the FCU fans in the baseline are bing controlled.  I would assume since
it is a residence or dorm the FCU fans have to run 24/7 at constant volume
to handle the required ventilation and the district chilled water and
district hot water (if that is your heat source) have to expend a lot more
energy to treat the ventilation than the DOAS with heat recovery.  Just a
thought.
Dennis

Wahid

gbXML and the Functional Mockup Interface (FMI) standard address very
different aspects of information exchange:

gbXML (http://www.gbxml.org/), similar than IFC (
http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/), has been developed to exchange
building parameters and simulation results between CAD systems and building
simulation programs, among other domains. The data are for example
parameters that describe building materials, dimension of constructions,
internal heat gain profiles, and outputs of simulation runs. gbXML contains
no executable code that for example computes energy use for a set of input
data, it only contains the inputs and outputs that are fed into or
retrieved from a simulator or a CAD system, using a syntax that is defined
in the standard. It addresses the problem of how to exchange data among
tools and users along the life cycle of buildings.

FMI (https://www.fmi-standard.org/) has been developed to exchange
simulators (the FMI for co-simulation standard) and models (the FMI for
model-exchange standard) in a tool independent standard. By model, I mean a
computer code that given some input, computes outputs such as room
temperatures and energy use (co-simulation) or time rate of change of
temperatures and energy (model exchange). What does this enable? With FMI,
you can develop a simulation model, or a controller or a fault detection
and diagnostics algorithm, export it in a standardized format as a
so-called Functional Mockup Unit, and then import it into a variety of
simulation tools (https://www.fmi-standard.org/tools), into a building
automation system (through an interface for Niagara AX that is currently in
development at LBNL), interface it with your own code or run it on the
cloud (http://www.xogeny.com/products/). All this is done in a tool
independent way; as long as your tool can export code as an FMU, you can
make use of this software ecosystem, that was typically developed for a
variety of application domains. There is an international project underway
(IEA EBC Annex 60, http://iea-annex60.org/) that further develops FMI
compliant applications for buildings.

All the best,

Michael

The review comments seems to imply that a secondary distribution loop is necessary because of the DES guidance.
Stating, "..loop parameters from that secondary loop must be modeled."
It also states that, "..hot water pumps must be modeling identically in the Baseline and Proposed Cases based on the Proposed Case values."

Anyways, the review comment is confusing because it seems to be quite poorly written.
"..this option is not available for purchased steam or hot water".  What option?  Option 1?
Separate the upstream and downstream equipment and make primary loops out of everything it is then.

Subject: RE: DES Option 1 Pump Power

Kevin,
Here's my interpretation of the LEED comment: An Option 1 heating loop is equivalent to a primary loop upstream with a secondary loop downstream. However, Appendix G requires heating loops to be modeled as primary-only. The baseline pump power allowance is based on a primary loop only, and there is no way (according to the LEED comment) to separate the primary loop pump power (which is excluded) from the secondary loop pump power. Therefore, the reviewer wants to see identical heating loop pump power in baseline and proposed.
However, in your case, your district/campus loop is a steam loop which you could argue has no pump power, which could potentially justify modeling 19W/gpm for the baseline heating loop and your actual separate steam and HW loops (from a steam-to-HW heat exchanger, correct?) in the proposed. Unless you get a more thorough review comment or find a CIR explaining it better, I would try that approach and explain it in detail with the revised submission.

Bill

Subject: [Bldg-sim] DES Option 1 Pump Power

Hello, I am reviewing an energy model and associated LEED comment for a DES project that is modeled using Option 1 (stand-alone scenario), there is no specific reference to pump power within the guidance document.  The LEED comment states:

"Since the project follows the DES guidance Option 1, only the Baseline secondary distribution loop from Appendix G, with the relevant pump and loop parameters from that secondary loop must be modeled. Additionally, since the distribution loop for hot water is a primary-only loop that includes both upstream and downstream equipment, this option is not available for purchased steam or hot water, and the Baseline Case hot water pumps must be modeling identically in the Baseline and Proposed Cases based on the Proposed Case values.

I believe the directive here is to model the baseline pumps identical to the proposed and equal to the proposed values.  The LEED review comment states that the loop includes upstream equipment when Option 1 is specifically to exclude upstream equipment and model stand-alone.  The energy source is purchased heat.

I think the problem is that I see that the steam coils in the roof-top units are modeled in the same loop as the HW terminal units.  If I separate these into two loops I should be able to claim energy savings for the pump power associated with the HW terminal units.  Is this correct or is it still required to model the HW terminal unit pump power identical in baseline and proposed cases?
Thank you.

I've been pondering this one as well. I'm imagining that if we say "DES = purchased heat = boiler" then Appendix G would want to have 19 W/gpm pumps primary to the building.  But on the other hand, that 19 W/gpm comes from an assumption of a boiler which may have a higher pressure drop than the HX or secondary loop connection in your case. If your proposed building has a secondary loop off of a campus distributed hot water system, then the allowance for 19 W/gpm is probably generous.

The wording is also ambiguous - the building could be considered "primary" if the connection to DES was a heat exchanger rather than a secondary pumping configuration. If you did go to Option 2, then the losses of the steam system or heating hot water system would be accounted for there.

I'd leave the steam vs HW argument out of it - you'd be claiming a pumping energy "benefit" in model space that ignores some real world losses for condensate recovery, losses in the piping, etc. Where the proposed is steam all the way to the coils, I think the baseline should also neglect pumping energy.

The interesting part of this project is that it sounds like it has district steam and primary heating hot water provided to the building? If so then stick with what the reviewer suggested.

If I'm not grasping the scenario and the building receives steam that is used directly in preheat coils and through a heat exchanger to create hot water for use in terminal units, then I think the 19 W/gpm should be allowed for the pumped portion only. I think this would also apply if the heating hot water was through a heat exchanger to allow for pressure drop of the heat exchanger.

What was your W/gpm for the proposed case? If the proposed is way less than the baseline I think we are missing something and the reviewer may be correct.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] DES Option 1 Pump Power

Kevin,
Here's my interpretation of the LEED comment: An Option 1 heating loop is equivalent to a primary loop upstream with a secondary loop downstream. However, Appendix G requires heating loops to be modeled as primary-only. The baseline pump power allowance is based on a primary loop only, and there is no way (according to the LEED comment) to separate the primary loop pump power (which is excluded) from the secondary loop pump power. Therefore, the reviewer wants to see identical heating loop pump power in baseline and proposed.
However, in your case, your district/campus loop is a steam loop which you could argue has no pump power, which could potentially justify modeling 19W/gpm for the baseline heating loop and your actual separate steam and HW loops (from a steam-to-HW heat exchanger, correct?) in the proposed. Unless you get a more thorough review comment or find a CIR explaining it better, I would try that approach and explain it in detail with the revised submission.

Bill

The last scenario applies, just as stated, the steam coils were modeled in the same loop as the terminal units.  I revised each into separate loops and separate meters to make sure they could be modeled as "primary loops".  As you know, a portion of the building contains spaces that have minimum air change requirements.  These spaces are modeled as CV per guidance using system type SZRH.  Therefore only the spaces that do not have minimum air change requirements may claim energy savings on pump power for zone equipment.  The W/gpm for the Proposed case is 11.7.  Is this excessively low?

Kind Regards,
Kevin

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Four open positions for humid climate building systems
	research project
Message-ID: <CAG7SY4tCsjjTekMa5sCg05MeG6=_z2L5v33uSrqeHyZj3FdHWw@mail.gmail.com>

The Low Exergy Module of the Future Cities Laboratory (
http://www.futurecities.ethz.ch/) in Singapore seeks candidates for four
open positions in an applied research project in the field of building
systems in humid climates.

Details for all positions can be found at:
http://www.suat.arch.ethz.ch/en/open-positions

Inquiries and applications can be emailed to Dr. Matthias Mast (
mast at arch.ethz.ch): http://www.futurecities.ethz.ch/person/dr-matthias-mast/

The research of the Low Exergy Module focuses on exploring, simulating and
testing of new high performance building systems and the integrated design
of high performance buildings. The 3for2 pilot project addresses the
transfer of technology and design aspects developed and tested at the
Future Cities Laboratory into a real-world building in Singapore. As part
of this pilot implementation, a section of a building in Singapore will be
built based on our technology and design concepts. This integrated pilot
implementation includes structural elements, new fa?ade solutions and novel
high-performance technology for air-conditioning.

Hi, Jason.

With all due respect to Trane TRACE, I have not found their built-in PRM Fan Calculator to accurately reflect the equations and methods in ASHRAE 90.1, Appendix G, particularly related to the way they handle the 'A' fan power credit.  Verify it for yourself, but I would calculate baseline fan power outside the software.

Thanks,

Jason,
If the DOAS fan power is what is driving you over the top on your proposed model, how are you dealing with outside air in the baseline?  If the added energy consumption for the FCU's handling all of the OA without heat recovery in the baseline is not offsetting the DOAS fan power then look at how the FCU fans in the baseline are bing controlled.  I would assume since it is a residence or dorm the FCU fans have to run 24/7 at constant volume to handle the required ventilation and the district chilled water and district hot water (if that is your heat source) have to expend a lot more energy to treat the ventilation than the DOAS with heat recovery.  Just a thought.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Fan power when changing baseline system per LEED District Energy rules


I'm modeling a multifamily building that uses a campus plant for cooling. I'm familiar with the USGBC document for modeling DES plants, and am currently looking at Option 1, which is an energy neutral purchased chilled water plant. Because the building is residential, the normal baseline system is System 1-PTAC. The USGBC document says to change this to a 4-pipe fan coil in order to make use of the purchased chilled water. Fair enough.
My problem is how to calculate fan power for this new baseline system. FCUs are not a normal baseline system, so there's no direction in Appendix G. Has anyone come across this before? If so, what did you do to calculate the fan power?
For what it's worth, I see three options:
1) Since I'm replacing System 1, use the formula for System 1, Pfan=CFMs*0.3. The resulting fan power is much lower than my proposed, which is a bummer, though it's primarily due to 5 DOAS fans that of course aren't in the baseline.
2) Allow TRACE to calculate the fan power using its built-in 90.1 features. This number comes out much higher than the proposed fan power, which is what tipped me off to this issue. I'm currently trying to back out how Trace arrived at the fan power it did.
3) The proposed building uses fan coils. Since the new baseline also does, set the fan powers equal and only receive credit from reduced run hours due to improved envelope and such. This sounds like a nice way to guarantee reviewer comments.
Any thoughts?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Appendix G Secondary Pump Control
Message-ID: <001501cefd8d$ebca8fe0$c35fafa0$@sudassociates.com>

I have a question regarding 90.1 2004 Appendix G baseline chilled water pump
control.  Section 3.1.3.10 says that baseline CHW systems must be
primary/secondary, with a constant flow primary loop and a variable flow
secondary loop.  The secondary pump will either ride the curve or be
controlled by a VSD depending on square footage.  In the case I currently
have in my hands, the pump rides the curve.  No questions yet. 

 

Section 3.1.3.11 goes on to state that each chiller shall have its own
condenser water and chilled water pumps, interlocked to operate with the
chiller.  This is clear and reasonable for the condenser water and primary
chilled water pumps, but what about secondary chilled water pumps?  For my
current application (one chiller, pump riding curve), my question simply
boils down to whether I should turn the secondary pump off when the chiller
is off, or if I should run it all of the time.  

  

But to get into it a little more, here are three approaches I see:

 

1.       Model one secondary pump for each chiller, and turn each pump off
when its associated chiller turns off.  Section 3.1.3.10 is titled Chilled
Water Pumps, and that section includes both primary and secondary pumps, so
when the next section references "chilled water pumps" that should include
both primary and secondary.  However, this does not reflect the typical
reality of one secondary pump serving multiple chillers, and the common
interpretation that only a primary pump has one single associated chiller.

 

2.       Model one secondary pump regardless of how many chillers there are,
and turn it off when all chillers are off.  This is perhaps most similar to
what you might expect in a 'real' system.  If you only have one chiller (as
I currently have), this is exactly the same as approach 1.  

 

3.       Model one secondary pump regardless of how many chillers there are,
and never turn it off.  Many buildings are unfortunately operated this way.
This approach significantly increases baseline energy when the pump is
riding the curve.

 

I have always used approach 2 without putting much thought into it.  But now
my results are highly dependent on which approach I take, and I see enough
ambiguity that arguments could be made for approach 3.  

 

Your thoughts?

 

Thanks,

Christian

Christian,
I always model one secondary pump for the baseline. I see no reason to do otherwise.
My approach to loop activation has been to model it the same as the proposed design. Using DOE-2 for example, it could be SCHEDULED to run 24/7 during cooling months, or DEMAND-ONLY to stay off until a coil or process load exists. If the proposed design has no CHW plant, but has a boiler/HHW plant, you could model the baseline CHW loop activation similarly to the proposed HHW loop. If the proposed design has no analogous loop operation, you just have to make a judgement call, but I am not aware of any guidance in 90.1 or LEED. Also keep in mind that 22W/gpm is the total pump power allowance for all your primary/secondary CHW pumps, and not the power of each pump.

Bill

I understand your approach to pump control.  But.would you be able to defend

Certainly the 90.1 folks had some specific intent, whether they made it

recently received the updated documentation spreadsheet for a v4 pilot
project, and they have updated the notes.  Not sure if this image will
come thru to everybody, so here's what it says:

 

"The sum of primary and secondary must be 22 W / gpm (349 KW/1000 L/s)
per G3.1.3.10.  Recommended that the pump power be split as one third
(primary) and two-thirds (secondary)."

Christian,

I always model one secondary pump for the baseline. I see no reason to
do otherwise.

My approach to loop activation has been to model it the same as the
proposed design. Using DOE-2 for example, it could be SCHEDULED to run
24/7 during cooling months, or DEMAND-ONLY to stay off until a coil or
process load exists. If the proposed design has no CHW plant, but has a
boiler/HHW plant, you could model the baseline CHW loop activation
similarly to the proposed HHW loop. If the proposed design has no
analogous loop operation, you just have to make a judgement call, but I
am not aware of any guidance in 90.1 or LEED. Also keep in mind that
22W/gpm is the total pump power allowance for all your primary/secondary
CHW pumps, and not the power of each pump.

Regards,

Bill

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Appendix G Secondary Pump Control

 

I have a question regarding 90.1 2004 Appendix G baseline chilled water
pump control.  Section 3.1.3.10 says that baseline CHW systems must be
primary/secondary, with a constant flow primary loop and a variable flow
secondary loop.  The secondary pump will either ride the curve or be
controlled by a VSD depending on square footage.  In the case I
currently have in my hands, the pump rides the curve.  No questions yet.


 

Section 3.1.3.11 goes on to state that each chiller shall have its own
condenser water and chilled water pumps, interlocked to operate with the
chiller.  This is clear and reasonable for the condenser water and
primary chilled water pumps, but what about secondary chilled water
pumps?  For my current application (one chiller, pump riding curve), my
question simply boils down to whether I should turn the secondary pump
off when the chiller is off, or if I should run it all of the time.  

  

But to get into it a little more, here are three approaches I see:

 

1.      Model one secondary pump for each chiller, and turn each pump
off when its associated chiller turns off.  Section 3.1.3.10 is titled
Chilled Water Pumps, and that section includes both primary and
secondary pumps, so when the next section references "chilled water
pumps" that should include both primary and secondary.  However, this
does not reflect the typical reality of one secondary pump serving
multiple chillers, and the common interpretation that only a primary
pump has one single associated chiller.

 

2.      Model one secondary pump regardless of how many chillers there
are, and turn it off when all chillers are off.  This is perhaps most
similar to what you might expect in a 'real' system.  If you only have
one chiller (as I currently have), this is exactly the same as approach
1.  

 

3.      Model one secondary pump regardless of how many chillers there
are, and never turn it off.  Many buildings are unfortunately operated
this way.  This approach significantly increases baseline energy when
the pump is riding the curve.

 

I have always used approach 2 without putting much thought into it.  But
now my results are highly dependent on which approach I take, and I see
enough ambiguity that arguments could be made for approach 3.  

 

Your thoughts?

 

Thanks,

Christian

Big Brother GBCI has eyes and ears everywhere... =)

I for one am very happy for clearer direction coming about on this point.  For reference, I think that same recent conversation brought about a reference I kept note of for ASHRAE interpretation IC 90.1-2007-14, which ruled that 22 W/GPM is a "whole system" power requirement, similar to Pfan for baseline fan calculations.

The one-third / two-thirds split is to my knowledge new direction, (I have previously simply dumped it all baseline pumping power onto secondary pump for simplicity of documentation - perhaps to my own detriment in certain cases), but I can empathize the reasoning behind providing such direction where distribution of pumping power could (in some cases) affect overall baseline performance.

Thanks very much for sharing James!

To clarify an email I sent to the last thread on the 22 W / gpm:  I recently received the updated documentation spreadsheet for a v4 pilot project, and they have updated the notes.  Not sure if this image will come thru to everybody, so here's what it says:

"The sum of primary and secondary must be 22 W / gpm (349 KW/1000 L/s) per G3.1.3.10.  Recommended that the pump power be split as one third (primary) and two-thirds (secondary)."

John,
I'm not sure how you have to report your CEU's or how technical or
discipline specific your training needs are, however, if you can self
report - two subscription services that seem to offer some fairly high
quality courses in numerous topics, Revit, Bentley, Word, Excel, C++,
Access, SQL Server, etc. are Lynda.com
(http://www.lynda.com/<http://www.lynda.com/member.aspx>)
and Infinite Skills.  Annual premium subscription to Lynda is around
$325.00 and to Infinite Skills (http://www.infiniteskills.com/)  is about
$120.00.  With both sites you can track your courses and your progress.
Dennis

Patrick,
Here are a few considerations:

1.       Apartments for working people will have low loads during the day and high loads at night.  The offices will have the reverse pattern.  Depending on the actual office schedules, the actual residential occupancy pattern and the ratio of office / residential space, 50% might work very well.  50% may also be rather close to "irresponsible" unless the local population is very tolerant of room temperatures that are a few degrees higher than normal!

2.       Regardless of #1 above, a LEED project should model the building based on the architect and Engineer's "Basis of Design" (BOD) document.  The scheduling and diversity patterns I mention in #1 are not commonly part of a BOD document, but in your case they sound critical.  You should (strongly) request this information!  If you make assumptions that differ from the Engineer's you may spend endless hours trying to reduce unmet cooling load hours (and probably will not get paid for them)

3.       Once you are confident of the schedules that have been assumed by the BOD, you should be able to represent them for the energy model.

Note: Because each apartment has two fan coils, each with a thermostat, you really have two zones.  This may become important for the cooling diversity.

Patrick,

I suspect they didn't assume that the bedroom wasn't cooled at the same time as the living room. They may have assumed that the cooling schedule of the office space is different than the apartments - maybe 8am to 5pm M-F  for the offices and close to the opposite for the apartments. Or they may have determined that the building peak load was 50% of the sum of the individual loads. A more likely scenario would be that the combined affect of both of those might equal 50%.

I don't think it would be acceptable to turn cooling off in half of the apartments even if you did the same thing in the Baseline building. Are you running into issues with the chiller being undersized?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modelling diversity in single zone apartments


Hi all,

I'm modelling a mixed office/residential tower building with 160 apartments in tropical climate, for LEED. The apartments are centrally cooled with fan coil units, in the living room and bedrooms. The design team sized the chiller with a diversity of 0.5, probably assuming that when the occupants are in the living room, they're not cooling the bedrooms or something of the sort.

Given the number of apartments, I modelled each apartment as a single block. I cannot use zone multipliers because of the specific geometry of the building. I have one combined FCU for each apartment, which is of course either on or off. I'm also grouping apartments based on orientation, but that's beside the point.

My question is about an approach to modelling the diversity of use of FCUs in the apartments. With my modelling simplification, I cannot model the diversity of cooling within an apartment. So what would be an acceptable approach?

I can only think of turning cooling off in half of the apartments, though apartments with cooling turned off are occupied and have internal loads. Would a LEED reviewer be ok with such an approach. Or is there a better way?

Thanks,
Patrick

Message-ID: <CAB9_V+R5AbbWMEtUjvKW+VsmJdX-Xyw7OtoWqt4G52GdwTjeQg@mail.gmail.com>

N++ is a building energy modeling interface from ExpertApp based on the
latest version of the EnergyPlus whole-building energy simulation engine
(V8.1).
N++ is built on the principle that building energy modeling should be
intuitive, fast, flexible, and most importantly visual, with a CAD-like
environment that fits in the conventional design process.
N++ allows architects, engineers and energy professionals develop and
manage building energy models in a timely fashion, to analyze multiple
design scenarios through either desktop or cloud-based simulation, and to
inform project decisions.

For more information, please visit: http://www.expertapp.com/npp.php

The main features of N++ are:

-Model creation in CAD-like environment
-3D orbit view and editing of model geometry
-Drag and drop of the main Energy Plus objects
-Import of raster and dxf drawings for fast zone tracing
-EnergyPlus model import and export
-Enhanced parametric analysis and optimization through jEPlus (
http://www.jeplus.org/wiki/doku.php) and GenOpt (
http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/GO/)
-Parallel simulation on desktop computer, local network or cloud services
(currently via JESS server-
http://www.jeplus.org/wiki/doku.php?id=docs:jess_service)
-Case tagging of the objects that allows multiple model versions in the
project (Proposed design, LEED baseline, Code compliance ...)
-Lighting and electric equipment count
-Graphical representation of the simulation results
-SVG viewer for model diagrams
-Enhanced HTML report viewer

Hi,

Thank you all for your answers. I may have confused everyone. The design
team used a diversity of 0.5 for the cooling equipment in the apartments
only. They haven't assumed this for the whole building.

Still, knowing that these are high-end apartments, I'm not entirely
convinced that people will turn cooling off when they don't occupy a space.
But if that's the assumption, I should go with it, right?

I had a look at the high-rise office/apartment model Dru pointed me to.
It's interesting to note that the apartments are modelled as single-zone
with cooling running 100% time and no setback.

So in conclusion, if I want to stick to the assumption of the design team,
I should split the apartment in 2 zones so that the FCUs in bedrooms and
living rooms can have different operation schedules.

Cheers,
Patrick

Hi Patrick,

Another substantial source of diversity to consider, for a large building and assuming a decent thermal envelope, is that in your most extreme after-occupancy/regular operation* cooling case it's likely not every zonal unit in the building would operate simultaneously.  Consider that for a simple square building, no more than 2 wall facades should be getting hit with direct sunlight at any given hour - so in turn the perimeter zones on the other two orientations would have a fraction of their design cooling loads for those hours.

I would NOT level any judgements, but 100% agree you should be collaboratively discussing with the mechanical designers understand how they came to that degree of capacity diversity so that your model matches what they are expecting to see.  You may want to prepare a summary of the current model's behavior/expectations regarding chiller capacity (via an autosizing run) to help marry your sets of assumptions with respect to building occupancy/operation.  As far as LEED rigor is concerned, when it comes to assumptions of design and building operation (whether in the construction documents or not), it's relatively defensible to put forward that you're matching what the engineer of record has determined for the project (whether you're discussing setbacks, setpoints, or anything similar).   Be mindful many such inputs need to be applied to both baseline and proposed models uniformly.

2 systems per apartment sounds correct from the description, and I also agree from some recent experience with a mixed-use building that you'll likely want to have a separate set of occupancy and system operations schedules defined for the residential vs. nonresidential spaces, for reasons already discussed.


Best regards,

~Nick

*Note from an electrical perspective, it is more typically prudent to design capacity for such cases of 100% operation, as every system may in fact need to run simultaneously, particularly after a power outage, when the building is first coming online.  Sometimes BMS programming is set up to limit and/or stage system operation in consideration of electrical service size limitations, however.

Patrick,

I suspect they didn't assume that the bedroom wasn't cooled at the same time as the living room. They may have assumed that the cooling schedule of the office space is different than the apartments - maybe 8am to 5pm M-F  for the offices and close to the opposite for the apartments. Or they may have determined that the building peak load was 50% of the sum of the individual loads. A more likely scenario would be that the combined affect of both of those might equal 50%.

I don't think it would be acceptable to turn cooling off in half of the apartments even if you did the same thing in the Baseline building. Are you running into issues with the chiller being undersized?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modelling diversity in single zone apartments


Hi all,

I'm modelling a mixed office/residential tower building with 160 apartments in tropical climate, for LEED. The apartments are centrally cooled with fan coil units, in the living room and bedrooms. The design team sized the chiller with a diversity of 0.5, probably assuming that when the occupants are in the living room, they're not cooling the bedrooms or something of the sort.

Given the number of apartments, I modelled each apartment as a single block. I cannot use zone multipliers because of the specific geometry of the building. I have one combined FCU for each apartment, which is of course either on or off. I'm also grouping apartments based on orientation, but that's beside the point.

My question is about an approach to modelling the diversity of use of FCUs in the apartments. With my modelling simplification, I cannot model the diversity of cooling within an apartment. So what would be an acceptable approach?

I can only think of turning cooling off in half of the apartments, though apartments with cooling turned off are occupied and have internal loads. Would a LEED reviewer be ok with such an approach. Or is there a better way?

Thanks,
Patrick

Dear all,

we are looking for user profiles for European residential consumers:
electricity, gas or oil, district heating/cooling.

We want to use then as a basis to map the differences across Europe and to
analyze the impact on the effective primary energy consumption of
households across Europe.

thanks already for any information provided!

Anderson,
I was checking this out recently I don't believe temperature or humidity setpoints are regulated by ASHRAE 90.1 during occupied periods.  I think they primarily limit this through ASHRAE 55 regarding thermal comfort.  Of course ASHRAE standard 55 is often not mandatory but it is certainly good practice.  It goes without saying that several space types such as hospitals and labs have special temperature and humidity requirements that are industry-specific.

Dear all,

We are working on a project that has a special occupancy space and we need to determine a setback/setup temperature for moments that the space is not occupied during working hours.

Section 6.4.3.3.2, of ASHRAE 90.1, states that setback temperature must be 13?C or lower, and setup temperature, 32?C or higher. I understand these temperatures are for off-hours.

Are there such limits of setback/setup temperature for working hours? Or is it defined by design?

Indeed, ASHRAE 55 is he relevant standard for thermal comfort; however... While ASHRAE 90.1 does not specify min and max for the temperature setpoints be during occupied hours, it does include requirements for separation of the heating and cooling setpoints to provide an adequate deadband.

Two things:


1.       For the affected climate zones, the wording of the cited section requires controls that allow for setback temperatures in a range large enough to include those temperatures... not those temperatures specifically.  To paraphrase, the controls must allow for a heating setback temperature setpoint anywhere between the occupied heating setpoint and down to 55F (or lower).  Likewise there must be a cooling setback range to include anything between the occupied cooling setpoint and up to 90F (or higher).  The prescriptive requirement is for a minimum range of control, not to define what those setback temperatures actually are.

2.       I agree with Scott: 90.1 does not prescriptively mandate temperature setpoints (for setback or occupied hours).  If you are doing an Appendix G based model, it does require baseline and proposed models to have matching inputs in this regard, however.

So in sum, I'd concur both your design (occupied) and setback temperatures should be determined in accordance with your mechanical design load calculations, which in turn should consider and be informed by owner/climate/industry-specific space conditioning requirements with respect to occupied and unoccupied states.

~Nick

I don't think the issue is the separate rooms. The diversities used by the designer are most likely:


1.       Different profiles  for the E/S/W orientations due to solar load occurring at different times of day - should calculate within energy model

2.       Each FCU is oversized compared to the peak load due to safety factors and rounding up to next size available from the factory - modeled loads should be slightly lower than the entered capacities

3.       Apartments won't be occupied and/or using their appliances all at the same time - this is the tricky one that is up to you to enter in some form

4.       0.5 doesn't seem like a calculated diversity - they may be using prior projects as a guide

However if the thermostats don't have integral occpuancy controls, I wouldn't make an assumption that the residents have turned off any particular thermostat at any time, and you'll have to decide for yourself if that means changing the model to increase the quantity of zones.

You could approximate the intensity of apartment loads by having some on and some off in groups, or all of them on the same schedule using an average amount of internal gain from lights and appliances. If you are having trouble matching the plant capacity of the designers with the model, you should confirm their BOD in terms of calculating the diversity, and what quantity of internal gains they assumed, etc.

Lastly take a look at square feet per ton as a benchmark to see where the plant is coming in. Does it compare with other projects in that area?

Hi,

Thank you all for your answers. I may have confused everyone. The design team used a diversity of 0.5 for the cooling equipment in the apartments only. They haven't assumed this for the whole building.

Still, knowing that these are high-end apartments, I'm not entirely convinced that people will turn cooling off when they don't occupy a space. But if that's the assumption, I should go with it, right?

I had a look at the high-rise office/apartment model Dru pointed me to. It's interesting to note that the apartments are modelled as single-zone with cooling running 100% time and no setback.

So in conclusion, if I want to stick to the assumption of the design team, I should split the apartment in 2 zones so that the FCUs in bedrooms and living rooms can have different operation schedules.

Cheers,
Patrick

Patrick,
Here are a few considerations:

1.       Apartments for working people will have low loads during the day and high loads at night.  The offices will have the reverse pattern.  Depending on the actual office schedules, the actual residential occupancy pattern and the ratio of office / residential space, 50% might work very well.  50% may also be rather close to "irresponsible" unless the local population is very tolerant of room temperatures that are a few degrees higher than normal!

2.       Regardless of #1 above, a LEED project should model the building based on the architect and Engineer's "Basis of Design" (BOD) document.  The scheduling and diversity patterns I mention in #1 are not commonly part of a BOD document, but in your case they sound critical.  You should (strongly) request this information!  If you make assumptions that differ from the Engineer's you may spend endless hours trying to reduce unmet cooling load hours (and probably will not get paid for them)

3.       Once you are confident of the schedules that have been assumed by the BOD, you should be able to represent them for the energy model.

Note: Because each apartment has two fan coils, each with a thermostat, you really have two zones.  This may become important for the cooling diversity.

Patrick,

I suspect they didn't assume that the bedroom wasn't cooled at the same time as the living room. They may have assumed that the cooling schedule of the office space is different than the apartments - maybe 8am to 5pm M-F  for the offices and close to the opposite for the apartments. Or they may have determined that the building peak load was 50% of the sum of the individual loads. A more likely scenario would be that the combined affect of both of those might equal 50%.

I don't think it would be acceptable to turn cooling off in half of the apartments even if you did the same thing in the Baseline building. Are you running into issues with the chiller being undersized?

PhD, first chapter you can find that. It is also published in Applied

Nick, David,

Thanks for your feedback. I can see there's room for sophistication when
wanting to calculate a proper diversity factor! After discussion with the
designers, they confirmed they considered that occupants would not be
cooling all the rooms at once and that 0.5 was not a calculated diversity
but from experience. And thermostats are under the occupants' control.

I would have been a bit more conservative but hopefully the peak load in
apartments will come (shortly) after people leave the office part. I guess
I'll be able to confirm all that once I make progress on the model and see
how much slack the chillers have around that time.

Regards,
Patrick

Great conversation.  

 

One thing I didn't see mentioned in the discussion is the fact you can
diversify the internal loads within the apartment (and office spaces) to
better reflect the engineers "experience" of load diversity.  This will have
a direct effect of reducing peak cooling and would save you having to split
up your apartments into separate zones. 

 

In my experience, more zones does not always equal better results but it
always equals more headaches and a lot more work.    

 

To setup your operating schedules to account for diversity whether it's
within a single zone or across an entire building use a weighted average
approach.   For example, if the connected lighting load in the apartment is
1W/sq.ft. and the living area and the apartments have equal areas and the
lights in each area are never on at the same time then lighting power would
never be more than 0.5W/sq.ft. You would use a maximum value of 0.5 in your
lighting schedule to describe this case.    

 

As Nick pointed out previously your diversified schedules would need to be
the same in both the baseline and proposed models. 

 

Another thing that might help is to try and duplicate the engineers peak
cooling load calc within the model.  I'm not sure what software you're using
but several tools allow you to do a "peak load calculation" for equipment
sizing that is separate from the actual 8760 simulation.  If your tool has
this capability you could setup a design cooling load calculation similar to
what the engineer will do (e.g. using ASHRAE 1% CDT and all internal loads
and occupancy at 100% for the entire day).  With that calculation you can
examine the theoretical building peak cooling load and then compare that to
the actual building cooling load under a diversified operating schedule.
You can then determine whether the 50% diversity is a valid assumption for
this project.

Hi Patrick,

 

Another substantial source of diversity to consider, for a large building
and assuming a decent thermal envelope, is that in your most extreme
after-occupancy/regular operation* cooling case it's likely not every zonal
unit in the building would operate simultaneously.  Consider that for a
simple square building, no more than 2 wall facades should be getting hit
with direct sunlight at any given hour - so in turn the perimeter zones on
the other two orientations would have a fraction of their design cooling
loads for those hours.

 

I would NOT level any judgements, but 100% agree you should be
collaboratively discussing with the mechanical designers understand how they
came to that degree of capacity diversity so that your model matches what
they are expecting to see.  You may want to prepare a summary of the current
model's behavior/expectations regarding chiller capacity (via an autosizing
run) to help marry your sets of assumptions with respect to building
occupancy/operation.  As far as LEED rigor is concerned, when it comes to
assumptions of design and building operation (whether in the construction
documents or not), it's relatively defensible to put forward that you're
matching what the engineer of record has determined for the project (whether
you're discussing setbacks, setpoints, or anything similar).   Be mindful
many such inputs need to be applied to both baseline and proposed models
uniformly.

 

2 systems per apartment sounds correct from the description, and I also
agree from some recent experience with a mixed-use building that you'll
likely want to have a separate set of occupancy and system operations
schedules defined for the residential vs. nonresidential spaces, for reasons
already discussed. 

 

 

Best regards,

 

~Nick

 

*Note from an electrical perspective, it is more typically prudent to design
capacity for such cases of 100% operation, as every system may in fact need
to run simultaneously, particularly after a power outage, when the building
is first coming online.  Sometimes BMS programming is set up to limit and/or
stage system operation in consideration of electrical service size
limitations, however.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Modelling diversity in single zone apartments

 

Hi,

 

Thank you all for your answers. I may have confused everyone. The design
team used a diversity of 0.5 for the cooling equipment in the apartments
only. They haven't assumed this for the whole building.

 

Still, knowing that these are high-end apartments, I'm not entirely
convinced that people will turn cooling off when they don't occupy a space.
But if that's the assumption, I should go with it, right?

 

I had a look at the high-rise office/apartment model Dru pointed me to. It's
interesting to note that the apartments are modelled as single-zone with
cooling running 100% time and no setback.

 

So in conclusion, if I want to stick to the assumption of the design team, I
should split the apartment in 2 zones so that the FCUs in bedrooms and
living rooms can have different operation schedules.

 

Cheers,

Patrick

Patrick,

Here are a few considerations:

1.       Apartments for working people will have low loads during the day
and high loads at night.  The offices will have the reverse pattern.
Depending on the actual office schedules, the actual residential occupancy
pattern and the ratio of office / residential space, 50% might work very
well.  50% may also be rather close to "irresponsible" unless the local
population is very tolerant of room temperatures that are a few degrees
higher than normal!

2.       Regardless of #1 above, a LEED project should model the building
based on the architect and Engineer's "Basis of Design" (BOD) document.  The
scheduling and diversity patterns I mention in #1 are not commonly part of a
BOD document, but in your case they sound critical.  You should (strongly)
request this information!  If you make assumptions that differ from the
Engineer's you may spend endless hours trying to reduce unmet cooling load
hours (and probably will not get paid for them)

3.       Once you are confident of the schedules that have been assumed by
the BOD, you should be able to represent them for the energy model.  

 

Note: Because each apartment has two fan coils, each with a thermostat, you
really have two zones.  This may become important for the cooling diversity.

Patrick,

 

I suspect they didn't assume that the bedroom wasn't cooled at the same time
as the living room. They may have assumed that the cooling schedule of the
office space is different than the apartments - maybe 8am to 5pm M-F  for
the offices and close to the opposite for the apartments. Or they may have
determined that the building peak load was 50% of the sum of the individual
loads. A more likely scenario would be that the combined affect of both of
those might equal 50%.

 

I don't think it would be acceptable to turn cooling off in half of the
apartments even if you did the same thing in the Baseline building. Are you
running into issues with the chiller being undersized?

 

Aaron

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modelling diversity in single zone apartments

 

Hi all,

 

I'm modelling a mixed office/residential tower building with 160 apartments
in tropical climate, for LEED. The apartments are centrally cooled with fan
coil units, in the living room and bedrooms. The design team sized the
chiller with a diversity of 0.5, probably assuming that when the occupants
are in the living room, they're not cooling the bedrooms or something of the
sort.

 

Given the number of apartments, I modelled each apartment as a single block.
I cannot use zone multipliers because of the specific geometry of the
building. I have one combined FCU for each apartment, which is of course
either on or off. I'm also grouping apartments based on orientation, but
that's beside the point.

 

My question is about an approach to modelling the diversity of use of FCUs
in the apartments. With my modelling simplification, I cannot model the
diversity of cooling within an apartment. So what would be an acceptable
approach?

 

I can only think of turning cooling off in half of the apartments, though
apartments with cooling turned off are occupied and have internal loads.
Would a LEED reviewer be ok with such an approach. Or is there a better way?

 

Thanks,

Patrick

Scott, Nick, Leen and Moore,



Thanks for your feedback. Now I have lots of sources to investigate a bit
more.

Thanks Leen for sharing your PhD research. I?ll have a look at it.



My conclusion so far is that there aren?t specific temperature values for
this situation. It?s basically a matter of design.

Hi Mike,

I agree that splitting 160 apartments in 2 is work that I'd rather avoid if
I can! I was originally considering adjusting schedules to represent
diversity. That works ok for internal gains. I have trouble seeing how that
can work for cooling equipment in a single zone apartment; it's either on
or off. Having one zone with diversified internal gains and cooling on is
not the same thing, in terms of energy use, as having 2 zones, one of which
has cooling turned off. But maybe that's ok as long as both proposed and
baseline are the same?

Thanks,
Patrick

I would think as long as you have properly accounted for the diversity via the schedules, the systems should just not run as long because there is less heat to remove from the space.  The only effects you are not capturing is if only one of the apartment zones should be perimeter, but you are grouping both into a single zone that sees the combined load.  That could change how often the core zone would come on versus the perimeter.  At any rate, I think the cycling of the unit on less often should get  you close to showing the diversity effects.

Hi Mike,

I agree that splitting 160 apartments in 2 is work that I'd rather avoid if I can! I was originally considering adjusting schedules to represent diversity. That works ok for internal gains. I have trouble seeing how that can work for cooling equipment in a single zone apartment; it's either on or off. Having one zone with diversified internal gains and cooling on is not the same thing, in terms of energy use, as having 2 zones, one of which has cooling turned off. But maybe that's ok as long as both proposed and baseline are the same?

Thanks,
Patrick

Great conversation.

One thing I didn't see mentioned in the discussion is the fact you can diversify the internal loads within the apartment (and office spaces) to better reflect the engineers "experience" of load diversity.  This will have a direct effect of reducing peak cooling and would save you having to split up your apartments into separate zones.

In my experience, more zones does not always equal better results but it always equals more headaches and a lot more work.

To setup your operating schedules to account for diversity whether it's within a single zone or across an entire building use a weighted average approach.   For example, if the connected lighting load in the apartment is 1W/sq.ft. and the living area and the apartments have equal areas and the lights in each area are never on at the same time then lighting power would never be more than 0.5W/sq.ft. You would use a maximum value of 0.5 in your lighting schedule to describe this case.

As Nick pointed out previously your diversified schedules would need to be the same in both the baseline and proposed models.

Another thing that might help is to try and duplicate the engineers peak cooling load calc within the model.  I'm not sure what software you're using but several tools allow you to do a "peak load calculation" for equipment sizing that is separate from the actual 8760 simulation.  If your tool has this capability you could setup a design cooling load calculation similar to what the engineer will do (e.g. using ASHRAE 1% CDT and all internal loads and occupancy at 100% for the entire day).  With that calculation you can examine the theoretical building peak cooling load and then compare that to the actual building cooling load under a diversified operating schedule.  You can then determine whether the 50% diversity is a valid assumption for this project.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Modelling diversity in single zone apartments

Nick, David,

Thanks for your feedback. I can see there's room for sophistication when wanting to calculate a proper diversity factor! After discussion with the designers, they confirmed they considered that occupants would not be cooling all the rooms at once and that 0.5 was not a calculated diversity but from experience. And thermostats are under the occupants' control.

I would have been a bit more conservative but hopefully the peak load in apartments will come (shortly) after people leave the office part. I guess I'll be able to confirm all that once I make progress on the model and see how much slack the chillers have around that time.

Regards,
Patrick

Hi Patrick,

Another substantial source of diversity to consider, for a large building and assuming a decent thermal envelope, is that in your most extreme after-occupancy/regular operation* cooling case it's likely not every zonal unit in the building would operate simultaneously.  Consider that for a simple square building, no more than 2 wall facades should be getting hit with direct sunlight at any given hour - so in turn the perimeter zones on the other two orientations would have a fraction of their design cooling loads for those hours.

I would NOT level any judgements, but 100% agree you should be collaboratively discussing with the mechanical designers understand how they came to that degree of capacity diversity so that your model matches what they are expecting to see.  You may want to prepare a summary of the current model's behavior/expectations regarding chiller capacity (via an autosizing run) to help marry your sets of assumptions with respect to building occupancy/operation.  As far as LEED rigor is concerned, when it comes to assumptions of design and building operation (whether in the construction documents or not), it's relatively defensible to put forward that you're matching what the engineer of record has determined for the project (whether you're discussing setbacks, setpoints, or anything similar).   Be mindful many such inputs need to be applied to both baseline and proposed models uniformly.

2 systems per apartment sounds correct from the description, and I also agree from some recent experience with a mixed-use building that you'll likely want to have a separate set of occupancy and system operations schedules defined for the residential vs. nonresidential spaces, for reasons already discussed.


Best regards,

~Nick

*Note from an electrical perspective, it is more typically prudent to design capacity for such cases of 100% operation, as every system may in fact need to run simultaneously, particularly after a power outage, when the building is first coming online.  Sometimes BMS programming is set up to limit and/or stage system operation in consideration of electrical service size limitations, however.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Modelling diversity in single zone apartments

Hi,

Thank you all for your answers. I may have confused everyone. The design team used a diversity of 0.5 for the cooling equipment in the apartments only. They haven't assumed this for the whole building.

Still, knowing that these are high-end apartments, I'm not entirely convinced that people will turn cooling off when they don't occupy a space. But if that's the assumption, I should go with it, right?

I had a look at the high-rise office/apartment model Dru pointed me to. It's interesting to note that the apartments are modelled as single-zone with cooling running 100% time and no setback.

So in conclusion, if I want to stick to the assumption of the design team, I should split the apartment in 2 zones so that the FCUs in bedrooms and living rooms can have different operation schedules.

Cheers,
Patrick

Patrick,
Here are a few considerations:

1.       Apartments for working people will have low loads during the day and high loads at night.  The offices will have the reverse pattern.  Depending on the actual office schedules, the actual residential occupancy pattern and the ratio of office / residential space, 50% might work very well.  50% may also be rather close to "irresponsible" unless the local population is very tolerant of room temperatures that are a few degrees higher than normal!

2.       Regardless of #1 above, a LEED project should model the building based on the architect and Engineer's "Basis of Design" (BOD) document.  The scheduling and diversity patterns I mention in #1 are not commonly part of a BOD document, but in your case they sound critical.  You should (strongly) request this information!  If you make assumptions that differ from the Engineer's you may spend endless hours trying to reduce unmet cooling load hours (and probably will not get paid for them)

3.       Once you are confident of the schedules that have been assumed by the BOD, you should be able to represent them for the energy model.

Note: Because each apartment has two fan coils, each with a thermostat, you really have two zones.  This may become important for the cooling diversity.

Patrick,

I suspect they didn't assume that the bedroom wasn't cooled at the same time as the living room. They may have assumed that the cooling schedule of the office space is different than the apartments - maybe 8am to 5pm M-F  for the offices and close to the opposite for the apartments. Or they may have determined that the building peak load was 50% of the sum of the individual loads. A more likely scenario would be that the combined affect of both of those might equal 50%.

I don't think it would be acceptable to turn cooling off in half of the apartments even if you did the same thing in the Baseline building. Are you running into issues with the chiller being undersized?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modelling diversity in single zone apartments


Hi all,

I'm modelling a mixed office/residential tower building with 160 apartments in tropical climate, for LEED. The apartments are centrally cooled with fan coil units, in the living room and bedrooms. The design team sized the chiller with a diversity of 0.5, probably assuming that when the occupants are in the living room, they're not cooling the bedrooms or something of the sort.

Given the number of apartments, I modelled each apartment as a single block. I cannot use zone multipliers because of the specific geometry of the building. I have one combined FCU for each apartment, which is of course either on or off. I'm also grouping apartments based on orientation, but that's beside the point.

My question is about an approach to modelling the diversity of use of FCUs in the apartments. With my modelling simplification, I cannot model the diversity of cooling within an apartment. So what would be an acceptable approach?

I can only think of turning cooling off in half of the apartments, though apartments with cooling turned off are occupied and have internal loads. Would a LEED reviewer be ok with such an approach. Or is there a better way?

Thanks,
Patrick

Hi Cory,

Well, maybe that was just the assumption I made that needed to be
challenged. I was imagining that the combined cooling equipment in the
single zone, running at part load, would have a different energy use than
one cooling equipment running at full load in one of the two zones, while
the other is off/cycling. Maybe the difference is marginal on equipment of
the size found in apartments?

Thanks,
Patrick

If you had DX equipment, I would be more inclined to agree that the part load performance of a combined unit would result in different energy use.  I think since you have chilled water fan coils, which I assume have valves to modulate flow, the main piece of concern is the fan, and with that size system, I don't think it will make a big difference.  To me the question is, how much will the energy use differ from a fan twice the size running somewhere around half the time versus two fans that are half the size not running coincidently?

Hi Cory,

Well, maybe that was just the assumption I made that needed to be challenged. I was imagining that the combined cooling equipment in the single zone, running at part load, would have a different energy use than one cooling equipment running at full load in one of the two zones, while the other is off/cycling. Maybe the difference is marginal on equipment of the size found in apartments?

Thanks,
Patrick

I would think as long as you have properly accounted for the diversity via the schedules, the systems should just not run as long because there is less heat to remove from the space.  The only effects you are not capturing is if only one of the apartment zones should be perimeter, but you are grouping both into a single zone that sees the combined load.  That could change how often the core zone would come on versus the perimeter.  At any rate, I think the cycling of the unit on less often should get  you close to showing the diversity effects.

Hi Mike,

I agree that splitting 160 apartments in 2 is work that I'd rather avoid if I can! I was originally considering adjusting schedules to represent diversity. That works ok for internal gains. I have trouble seeing how that can work for cooling equipment in a single zone apartment; it's either on or off. Having one zone with diversified internal gains and cooling on is not the same thing, in terms of energy use, as having 2 zones, one of which has cooling turned off. But maybe that's ok as long as both proposed and baseline are the same?

Thanks,

Great conversation.

One thing I didn't see mentioned in the discussion is the fact you can diversify the internal loads within the apartment (and office spaces) to better reflect the engineers "experience" of load diversity.  This will have a direct effect of reducing peak cooling and would save you having to split up your apartments into separate zones.

In my experience, more zones does not always equal better results but it always equals more headaches and a lot more work.

To setup your operating schedules to account for diversity whether it's within a single zone or across an entire building use a weighted average approach.   For example, if the connected lighting load in the apartment is 1W/sq.ft. and the living area and the apartments have equal areas and the lights in each area are never on at the same time then lighting power would never be more than 0.5W/sq.ft. You would use a maximum value of 0.5 in your lighting schedule to describe this case.

As Nick pointed out previously your diversified schedules would need to be the same in both the baseline and proposed models.

Another thing that might help is to try and duplicate the engineers peak cooling load calc within the model.  I'm not sure what software you're using but several tools allow you to do a "peak load calculation" for equipment sizing that is separate from the actual 8760 simulation.  If your tool has this capability you could setup a design cooling load calculation similar to what the engineer will do (e.g. using ASHRAE 1% CDT and all internal loads and occupancy at 100% for the entire day).  With that calculation you can examine the theoretical building peak cooling load and then compare that to the actual building cooling load under a diversified operating schedule.  You can then determine whether the 50% diversity is a valid assumption for this project.

Nick, David,

Thanks for your feedback. I can see there's room for sophistication when wanting to calculate a proper diversity factor! After discussion with the designers, they confirmed they considered that occupants would not be cooling all the rooms at once and that 0.5 was not a calculated diversity but from experience. And thermostats are under the occupants' control.

I would have been a bit more conservative but hopefully the peak load in apartments will come (shortly) after people leave the office part. I guess I'll be able to confirm all that once I make progress on the model and see how much slack the chillers have around that time.

Regards,
Patrick

Hi Patrick,

Another substantial source of diversity to consider, for a large building and assuming a decent thermal envelope, is that in your most extreme after-occupancy/regular operation* cooling case it's likely not every zonal unit in the building would operate simultaneously.  Consider that for a simple square building, no more than 2 wall facades should be getting hit with direct sunlight at any given hour - so in turn the perimeter zones on the other two orientations would have a fraction of their design cooling loads for those hours.

I would NOT level any judgements, but 100% agree you should be collaboratively discussing with the mechanical designers understand how they came to that degree of capacity diversity so that your model matches what they are expecting to see.  You may want to prepare a summary of the current model's behavior/expectations regarding chiller capacity (via an autosizing run) to help marry your sets of assumptions with respect to building occupancy/operation.  As far as LEED rigor is concerned, when it comes to assumptions of design and building operation (whether in the construction documents or not), it's relatively defensible to put forward that you're matching what the engineer of record has determined for the project (whether you're discussing setbacks, setpoints, or anything similar).   Be mindful many such inputs need to be applied to both baseline and proposed models uniformly.

2 systems per apartment sounds correct from the description, and I also agree from some recent experience with a mixed-use building that you'll likely want to have a separate set of occupancy and system operations schedules defined for the residential vs. nonresidential spaces, for reasons already discussed.


Best regards,

~Nick

*Note from an electrical perspective, it is more typically prudent to design capacity for such cases of 100% operation, as every system may in fact need to run simultaneously, particularly after a power outage, when the building is first coming online.  Sometimes BMS programming is set up to limit and/or stage system operation in consideration of electrical service size limitations, however.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Modelling diversity in single zone apartments

Hi,

Thank you all for your answers. I may have confused everyone. The design team used a diversity of 0.5 for the cooling equipment in the apartments only. They haven't assumed this for the whole building.

Still, knowing that these are high-end apartments, I'm not entirely convinced that people will turn cooling off when they don't occupy a space. But if that's the assumption, I should go with it, right?

I had a look at the high-rise office/apartment model Dru pointed me to. It's interesting to note that the apartments are modelled as single-zone with cooling running 100% time and no setback.

So in conclusion, if I want to stick to the assumption of the design team, I should split the apartment in 2 zones so that the FCUs in bedrooms and living rooms can have different operation schedules.

Cheers,
Patrick

Patrick,
Here are a few considerations:

1.       Apartments for working people will have low loads during the day and high loads at night.  The offices will have the reverse pattern.  Depending on the actual office schedules, the actual residential occupancy pattern and the ratio of office / residential space, 50% might work very well.  50% may also be rather close to "irresponsible" unless the local population is very tolerant of room temperatures that are a few degrees higher than normal!

2.       Regardless of #1 above, a LEED project should model the building based on the architect and Engineer's "Basis of Design" (BOD) document.  The scheduling and diversity patterns I mention in #1 are not commonly part of a BOD document, but in your case they sound critical.  You should (strongly) request this information!  If you make assumptions that differ from the Engineer's you may spend endless hours trying to reduce unmet cooling load hours (and probably will not get paid for them)

3.       Once you are confident of the schedules that have been assumed by the BOD, you should be able to represent them for the energy model.

Note: Because each apartment has two fan coils, each with a thermostat, you really have two zones.  This may become important for the cooling diversity.

Patrick,

I suspect they didn't assume that the bedroom wasn't cooled at the same time as the living room. They may have assumed that the cooling schedule of the office space is different than the apartments - maybe 8am to 5pm M-F  for the offices and close to the opposite for the apartments. Or they may have determined that the building peak load was 50% of the sum of the individual loads. A more likely scenario would be that the combined affect of both of those might equal 50%.

I don't think it would be acceptable to turn cooling off in half of the apartments even if you did the same thing in the Baseline building. Are you running into issues with the chiller being undersized?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modelling diversity in single zone apartments


Hi all,

I'm modelling a mixed office/residential tower building with 160 apartments in tropical climate, for LEED. The apartments are centrally cooled with fan coil units, in the living room and bedrooms. The design team sized the chiller with a diversity of 0.5, probably assuming that when the occupants are in the living room, they're not cooling the bedrooms or something of the sort.

Given the number of apartments, I modelled each apartment as a single block. I cannot use zone multipliers because of the specific geometry of the building. I have one combined FCU for each apartment, which is of course either on or off. I'm also grouping apartments based on orientation, but that's beside the point.

My question is about an approach to modelling the diversity of use of FCUs in the apartments. With my modelling simplification, I cannot model the diversity of cooling within an apartment. So what would be an acceptable approach?

I can only think of turning cooling off in half of the apartments, though apartments with cooling turned off are occupied and have internal loads. Would a LEED reviewer be ok with such an approach. Or is there a better way?

Thanks,
Patrick

	baseline sizing
Message-ID: <CAPAgWczrRooPXR_h47ZHHdoGMx9CKpadd8jw=a=3aq2Hf_r5ig@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

When sizing cooling equipment for apartments, the design team on my project
used a worst case scenario approach of maxing out all internal loads. For
instance, lighting would be on during the day, with full occupancy and all
plug equipment running, while the sun is hitting the windows. Adjacent
rooms would be considered without cooling.
For LEED, the sizing for the baseline is based on schedules representing
typical operations for occupancy, lighting, plug, etc. That leads the
baseline to size equipment that has smaller capacity than what considered
for the proposed design.
There's an extra dimension, in the fact the design team sized equipment for
each individual room, reaching their peak load at different times of the
day. So the total cooling capacity is the sum of the worst possible
scenarios. The model currently uses a single zone per apartment, with a not
so worst case scenario.
How do I solve this conundrum? Am I missing something?
Thanks,Patrick

Patrick:

The 50% diversity factor for the residential occupied areas that you describe may or may not be aggressive, though it has the potential to lead to downstream problems involving lawyers. While it may be true you are not 'on the hook' for designing an undersized/underperforming engineered mechanical system design (the engineer of record is holding this bag), you have been presented a hand that if you choose to play forward,  presents you with a great opportunity for showing your chops to the building owner and allows you to demonstrate the true power of hourly quasi-steady state whole building energy simulations to the community that pays our bills.  I've been in residential mixed-use retrofit situations where we have downsized existing chiller capacity by more than 50% (after careful analysis of simulation output using different tools to reach consensus), but in a new construction scenario a carte blanche 50% diversity factor scenario can, if distribution piping is aggressively sized, create some problems for later easily remedying.

Once you determine what kind of internal load peaks (and appropriate time-variant schedules?) were assumed by the owner/design team, if you have the time/budget you might want to incorporate some quick investigation of schedule diversity into your proposed model to determine relative sensitivity against block load vs peak load required proposed chiller tonnage...


Some fodder for providing defendable default residential gain schedules to de-rate/deviate from to test the 50% diversity factor assumption can be found in the recently updated  NREL "Building America House Simulation Protocols" document - updated in December of 2013 but still marked as a draft.  This draft pdf document ships as part of the installation of the free NREL BEopt v2.1.0.0 software - released last week - get it here: https://beopt.nrel.gov/downloadBEopt2



The pdf is filled with loads of simulation tool agnostic assumptions (and supporting documentation) that can be useful for generating input data for residential energy modeling activities.  I hope you find it useful.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Modelling diversity in single zone apartments

Hi,

Thank you all for your answers. I may have confused everyone. The design team used a diversity of 0.5 for the cooling equipment in the apartments only. They haven't assumed this for the whole building.

Still, knowing that these are high-end apartments, I'm not entirely convinced that people will turn cooling off when they don't occupy a space. But if that's the assumption, I should go with it, right?

I had a look at the high-rise office/apartment model Dru pointed me to. It's interesting to note that the apartments are modelled as single-zone with cooling running 100% time and no setback.

So in conclusion, if I want to stick to the assumption of the design team, I should split the apartment in 2 zones so that the FCUs in bedrooms and living rooms can have different operation schedules.

Cheers,
Patrick

Patrick,
Here are a few considerations:

1.       Apartments for working people will have low loads during the day and high loads at night.  The offices will have the reverse pattern.  Depending on the actual office schedules, the actual residential occupancy pattern and the ratio of office / residential space, 50% might work very well.  50% may also be rather close to "irresponsible" unless the local population is very tolerant of room temperatures that are a few degrees higher than normal!

2.       Regardless of #1 above, a LEED project should model the building based on the architect and Engineer's "Basis of Design" (BOD) document.  The scheduling and diversity patterns I mention in #1 are not commonly part of a BOD document, but in your case they sound critical.  You should (strongly) request this information!  If you make assumptions that differ from the Engineer's you may spend endless hours trying to reduce unmet cooling load hours (and probably will not get paid for them)

3.       Once you are confident of the schedules that have been assumed by the BOD, you should be able to represent them for the energy model.

Note: Because each apartment has two fan coils, each with a thermostat, you really have two zones.  This may become important for the cooling diversity.

Patrick,

I suspect they didn't assume that the bedroom wasn't cooled at the same time as the living room. They may have assumed that the cooling schedule of the office space is different than the apartments - maybe 8am to 5pm M-F  for the offices and close to the opposite for the apartments. Or they may have determined that the building peak load was 50% of the sum of the individual loads. A more likely scenario would be that the combined affect of both of those might equal 50%.

I don't think it would be acceptable to turn cooling off in half of the apartments even if you did the same thing in the Baseline building. Are you running into issues with the chiller being undersized?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modelling diversity in single zone apartments


Hi all,

I'm modelling a mixed office/residential tower building with 160 apartments in tropical climate, for LEED. The apartments are centrally cooled with fan coil units, in the living room and bedrooms. The design team sized the chiller with a diversity of 0.5, probably assuming that when the occupants are in the living room, they're not cooling the bedrooms or something of the sort.

Given the number of apartments, I modelled each apartment as a single block. I cannot use zone multipliers because of the specific geometry of the building. I have one combined FCU for each apartment, which is of course either on or off. I'm also grouping apartments based on orientation, but that's beside the point.

My question is about an approach to modelling the diversity of use of FCUs in the apartments. With my modelling simplification, I cannot model the diversity of cooling within an apartment. So what would be an acceptable approach?

I can only think of turning cooling off in half of the apartments, though apartments with cooling turned off are occupied and have internal loads. Would a LEED reviewer be ok with such an approach. Or is there a better way?

Thanks,
Patrick

Hi Patrick,

I just wanted to clarify for you that Appendix G (G3.1.2.2.1) requires the simulation of sizing runs for equipment selection based on either the peak from the weather file or ASHRAE 99.6% heating and 1% cooling design temperatures.  As far as I know this is not something USGBC or GBCI has written a clarifying rule on for LEED.

As far as being frustrated over engineers doing overly conservative load calculations, welcome to life as an energy analyst.  The best you can hope for is to use simulation to show them and the building owner that they are over engineering the system and try to get some concession.  Ultimately at the end of the day it's the engineer who is stamping the work and taking on the liability that has the final say.

Hi Mike,

I can't say I'm frustrated yet. Just going through the learning curve. I'm
sure frustration will come in time!

I was musing about the potential imbalance in sizing approach between the
proposed design and the baseline design. If we assume for a second that
engineers also use ASHRAE design days when sizing equipment for the
proposed design, there is still a potentially significant difference
between schedules used for sizing and normal operation schedules. Is the
1.15 sizing factor for baseline cooling enough to cover such imbalance? I
don't know enough to say so yet.

Patrick

To be honest, the only potential "overly conservative" sizing I can see
going on here is if the building is served by a central cooling plant and
that plant has been sized based on the sum of the peak loads and not the
peak coincident block load for the building.  If this is in fact how they
sized the system then there is potentially a large cost savings that could
be had by appropriately sizing the central plant.

The "worst case" scenario that you describe is a real scenario that can
happen fairly easily.  All it takes is someone to be at home with their
lights on and appliances running on a peak summer day.  That doesn't seem
like a very unlikely scenario at the zone level.

As for how the Baseline equipment should be sized, it should be no
different in terms of lighting, plug loads, and solar gains.  The only
stipulation on the baseline simulation is that it is oversized by a
prescriptive 25% for heating and 15% for cooling.  ASHRAE 90.1 doesn't
strictly define what a "sizing run" is, but it would be considered standard
practice to utilize the peak lighting and plug loads during your sizing
calculations (i.e. don't assume any diversity on the lights and use the
maximum anticipated coincident plug load value).

HI Patrick,



To play devil's advocate, I'll just put forward none of the practices you're lamenting are unusual or even necessarily a bad idea from a design perspective.



That said, it isn't unusual in my experience for proposed model cooling capacities to sum larger than a baseline model counterpart (and this can quickly become an arbitrary figure when you've got many small systems).  If however you are looking at many magnitudes difference between your models, that in my experience can be a bright red flag to carefully review your model's assumptions of loads & scheduling against the mechanical designer's - you may be missing critical information.



I would also contend LEED & 90.1 together have very little to say regarding equipment sizing methodology - particularly for determing schedules or which loads are to be considered at 0%, 100%, or anything between for determining capacities.  The only related rules that come to mind are the weather items Mike mentions and the basic requirement for the baseline model to match the proposed model generally for all such scheduling inputs.



Your energy modeling software of choice may dictate what degree of control you have in this matter, but I can volunteer that for eQuest/DOE2 a separate set of schedules and weather conditions can be assigned for both heating and cooling design days, independent of normal operation.  These inputs are used on the LOADS side of the simulation and pretty much directly effect the results for system capacity autosizing.  Coming out of the wizards, you'll find by default eQuest assumes "normal" fractional operation schedules are to be used for heating and cooling design days (HDD/CDD).  This at times can be in sharp contrast to the load assumptions used for equipment sizing protocol outside of an annual simulation, and if I were you I'd also consider reviewing such scheduling assumptions with your mechanical designer.

[cid:image001.png at 01CEF197.B330F950]

[cid:image002.png at 01CEF199.83784270]



I'd also reinforce that while energy modeling can inform and provide insight one can't get anywhere else, at the end of the day the burden of such decisions (and the associated liabilities) are in the designer's hands.  I try to convey such information in a way that avoids "butting heads," but there are times someone at the table isn't really there to talk, learn, and consider changing their minds.  You can try your best to make a case, but ultimately you can't make yourself responsible for what other's paychecks are written for.  Done politically, as Mike suggests, you can leverage your expertise to potentially win new design work if that's within your scope of interests, but be careful to avoid burning bridges ;).



Hope that helps a bit!

"swing."  The building and its contents will absorb a lot of energy 
if the air temperature is allowed to rise a few degrees during peak 
events.  Modeling work that I have done in ASHRAE 1199-RP and 
elsewhere shows that tolerating an occasional 3 F temp rise above the 
set point can reduce the required equipment size by up to 35% 
(depending on building mass etc. etc.)

It is excessively conservative for cooling calcs to assume peak 
internal gains coincident with peak outdoor conditions.  On hot 
afternoons, people very rarely cook full turkey dinners with all the 
TVs on.  If they do, let them warm up a little.  Better than paying 
for an oversized system and running it at lower part load all the time.

A major (and perhaps the only significant) distinction between 
residential and non-residential design philosophy is that in non-res 
situations, people are constrained about what they can do to control 
their environment.  In non-res, the worker must stay at his/her desk 
and slave on ... in res, the occupants can close the shades, move out 
of the sun, and decide to barbecue when it is hot.  Much more 
forgiving situation, so it is nuts to double-oversize res cooling 
systems for the worst worst conditions.  In my humble opinion.

All of which relates to actually designing a good system, as opposed 
to doing 90.1 analysis.  The two activities probably have minimal 
overlap at best.

Chip,

What you say makes sense to a point.  I would argue that most Owner's would
expect the system to work under the very conditions you describe as
excessively conservative and if they don't the contractor and engineer will
be hearing about it down the line.  This is something that should be
discussed on a project by project basis, because when presented properly
the Owner can see considerable savings from such a design as long as they
understand the risk they are taking on by accepting the reduced system size.

When selecting a residential unit, I would undersize the cooling capacity
and oversize the heating capacity. The energy use with decreasing cooling
capacity is not directly proportional (about 1 kw/ton at 100% capacity to 3
kw/ton at 20% capacity).  The energy use of a heating system tends to be
directly proportional to the heating load (up to 90% efficiency).  This is
also true for commercial buildings.  Residential unit control is usually
ON-OFF.  It is more comfortable to let the fan and cooling system run
continuously and let the temperature rise a few degrees under extreme
conditions.  150 years ago there was no air conditioning and mankind
survived.

The "worst case" scenario that you describe is a real scenario that can
happen fairly easily.  All it takes is someone to be at home with their
lights on and appliances running on a peak summer day.  That doesn't seem
like a very unlikely scenario at the zone level.  

As for how the Baseline equipment should be sized, it should be no different
in terms of lighting, plug loads, and solar gains.  The only stipulation on
the baseline simulation is that it is oversized by a prescriptive 25% for
heating and 15% for cooling.  ASHRAE 90.1 doesn't strictly define what a
"sizing run" is, but it would be considered standard practice to utilize the
peak lighting and plug loads during your sizing calculations (i.e. don't
assume any diversity on the lights and use the maximum anticipated

I was musing about the potential imbalance in sizing approach between the

engineers also use ASHRAE design days when sizing equipment for the proposed

schedules used for sizing and normal operation schedules. Is the 1.15 sizing

This statement is a little troubling to me:

"Adjacent rooms would be considered without cooling."


I would suggest that all conditioned spaces be considered conditioned, 
not at ambient temperature, although that is a design decision and must 
be made by the design engineer.

This is a very interesting conversation.

One that could also be held about sizing domestic hot water systems. ASHRAE
also tends to grossly oversize those, based on what I've seen in existing
buildings on projects where they wanted to replace the system. By
monitoring actual flow and doing the ASHRAE calc, it wasn't rare that
ASHRAE recommended double of what was actually needed.

Anyway, I'm sure you are all aware of this, but I feel I must say it anyway
because it's always good to be reminded of the simple things: you should be
careful when applying the statement "undersize the cooling capacity and
oversize the heating capacity" when selecting PTHPs, especially if you end
up with a grossly oversized cooling side. You should select the system
based on the cooling capacity needed anyway (and add an electric resistance
if need be in certain climate zones), unless you really like humidity and
what comes with it. I've witnessed that mistake before and it's not pretty,
especially in a humid climate. If this weak contribution can prevent
someone from making that mistake then it would have been worth it...

Best,
Julien

Description


N++ is a building energy modeling software created to emulate the
architectural and engineering design process. As a front interface for the
highly capable EnergyPlus (v8.1) simulation engine, N++ allows the user to
input project information into the energy simulation in an intuitive,
highly visible fashion that simplifies the energy modeling process for
designers who are new to energy analysis.
During the presentation Mr. Bajic will talk about the new features in N++
version 2014 and demonstrate the construction of an energy model, that will
include various parametric runs and scenarios, collaboration with 3rd party
tools like JEPlus, JESS (http://www.jeplus.org) and GenOpt (
http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/GO/), perform an optimization of the
energy model and talk about how N++ can be utilized for simulation via
cloud services (currently via JESS server).

About the Speaker: Mr. Bajic is a mechanical engineer with over 16 years of
experience in the HVAC industry as a designer, energy modeler and software
developer. His experience is both international and domestic. Mr.Bajic?s
main focus is building software applications that will help architects and

Message-ID: <CAD7gt0V1v--tEb6+qO0CSRZS4B7UKASyjtqNxqJKDhaw9z30vw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone!

It seems to me that to get an output of "Surface inside/outside
temperature" in TAS is not straightforward (not easy). We couldn't figure
out how to get it. Any hint/direction please?

Also can TAS output "Zone Ventilation Volume Flow Rate" or something
similar. We want to check how much air passes from a zone to outdoors
through the "hole" we modeled on a surface.

Thank you in anticipation!

Kind regards,

Hello Group,

 

I am modeling an existing building which could be seen as two buildings
connected by a short hallway.  The quick story on this facility is that
there were two buildings which were connected by hallways at some point, and
are now on the same chilled and hot water systems. I'm having trouble
finding a clear definition in 90.1 which tells me whether I should be
modeling this as one building or two with a shared energy plant.  This is
not a LEED project; I am only interested in a 90.1 interpretation.  

 

Does anyone know of any clarifications, interpretations, or past experience
which could help guide me? 

 

Thanks,

90.1 is flexible to model only one building or as a combined building, the determinant is what the client's purpose is in deciding to have an energy model project completed.

You could obviously model the whole complex with the specific central plant equipment, or else a single building could be modeled using district energy sources for heating and cooling depending on what the goal was for the study.

I agree completely.

Let the scope/purpose of your modeling efforts decide whether modeling both building as one model is going to be beneficial.

>From my experience, the extra work entailed in properly setting up a representative "campus" plan may well be less work than just modeling both buildings, and if in the course of your studies you intend to address efficiency measures applied/unique to both buildings, I expect it will be more efficient and simpler to work within a unified project.

I'm seeing enough typos in my last reply to warrant a re-issue (following)... sorry for any confusion!

I agree completely.

Let the scope/purpose of your modeling efforts determine whether modeling both buildings as one model is going to be preferable.  90.1 leaves this kind of decision up to the modeler.

>From my experience, the extra work entailed in properly setting up (and documenting) a representative "campus" plant can easily become more work than simply modeling both buildings. If you intend to address efficiency measures applied or unique to both buildings, I expect it will be more efficient and simpler to work within a unified project.

Best regards,

90.1 is flexible to model only one building or as a combined building, the determinant is what the client's purpose is in deciding to have an energy model project completed.

You could obviously model the whole complex with the specific central plant equipment, or else a single building could be modeled using district energy sources for heating and cooling depending on what the goal was for the study.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Addition, or Separate Building?

Hello Group,

I am modeling an existing building which could be seen as two buildings connected by a short hallway.  The quick story on this facility is that there were two buildings which were connected by hallways at some point, and are now on the same chilled and hot water systems. I'm having trouble finding a clear definition in 90.1 which tells me whether I should be modeling this as one building or two with a shared energy plant.  This is not a LEED project; I am only interested in a 90.1 interpretation.

Does anyone know of any clarifications, interpretations, or past experience which could help guide me?

Thanks,
Christian

Hi

I would like to add to this discussion, a couple of months ago we had an interesting review comment from LEED on this issue and it has rattled us a little. There is a definition of whether a building is one or two. Off the top of my head I can't remember where it is (sorry for that not terribly useful) but we had a two buildings connected by a corridor all fed with the same boiler and chiller. LEED specifically told us that because it was only connected by a corridor it had to be regarded as two separate buildings. We had to change LEED certifications and redo a huge amount of the energy model in order to split the energy usage in two. I would suggest that you contact LEED to check you are doing the right thing, it will save you hours of pain and money. This is all assuming you are doing LEED, I know that this definition was not in 90.1 it was somewhere else in LEED documentation.

Hi Annie,

This issue you are facing is a LEED issue and it is defined by the
LEED Minimum Program Requirements (Jan 2011), Suplemental Guidance to
the Minimum Program Requirements Rev 2 (Sep 2011), and LEED Aplication
Guide for Multiple Buildings and On-Campus Building Projects (Oct
2011).

The LEED MPR defines a super structure (single buildings) when two
structures are linked by a space other than a corridor or park garage
(maybe regularly occupied space). Therefore you would have to use the
Multiple Buildings and On-Campus rulings and for energy modelling. The
multiple building works as a single LEED certification for a group or
buildings where each building or both buildings combined must comply
with the requirements. On-campus project works in two stages, you get
the site related credits on a first stage and then you may proceed
with the certification of buildings inside the campus.

Regards,
Dionisio Franca
LEED AP EB+OM, ND

All,

Can anyone share their experience with the modified baseline model HVAC description in ASHRAE 90.1 - 2007 and 2010? (copied below)  ASHRAE 90.1-2004 did not require the baseline model for systems 5,6,7 and 8 to have separate HVAC systems per floor and I'd like to hear how people have interpreted this and, if anyone can explain the reasoning for this.

For example, the proposed model of a 15 story office building might have 2 AHUs, one serving the east wing and one serving the west wing.  For the baseline per ASHRAE 90.1-2007 or 2010, will these 2 AHUs be replaced with 15 separate VAV units? Or can the 2 AHUs be kept as long as it satisfies the statement "Floors with identical thermal blocks can be grouped for modeling purposes"?

ASHRAE 90.1 - 2004
G3.1.1 Baseline HVAC System Type and Description.

on usage, number of floors, conditioned floor area, and heating

Yes, for ASHRAE 90.1-2007 and 2010 you will have 15 separate VAV AHUs (one per floor) in the baseline.  I'm not sure of the reasoning for the change unless it is simply for standardization of the number of baseline systems.

I ALWAYS model using the "Floors with identical thermal blocks can be grouped for modeling purposes" allowance, as long as it's thermodynamically appropriate.
Same operating schedule on all 15 floors?  Same setpoints?  Same plug loads and lighting?  What difference would it make to model 15 separate air handlers? (none)
One of my assessment criteria is "Can I explain what I did in front of a group of peers and expect that they'll agree with what I did?"  In this case, I think it would be very hard for them to disagree.

For example, the proposed model of a 15 story office building might have 2 AHUs, one serving the east wing and one serving the west wing.  For the baseline per ASHRAE 90.1-2007 or 2010, will these 2 AHUs be replaced with 15 separate VAV units? Or can the 2 AHUs be kept as long as it satisfies the statement "Floors with identical thermal blocks can be grouped for modeling purposes"?

ASHRAE 90.1 - 2004
G3.1.1 Baseline HVAC System Type and Description.
HVAC systems in the baseline building design shall be based
on usage, number of floors, conditioned floor area, and heating
source as specified in Table G3.1.1A and shall conform
with the system descriptions in Table G3.1.1B.

ASHRAE 90.1 - 2007 and 2010

HVAC systems in the baseline building design shall be based
on usage, number of floors, conditioned floor area, and heating
source as specified in Table G3.1.1A and shall conform

2, 3, and 4, each thermal block shall be modeled with its own
HVAC system. For systems 5, 6, 7, and 8, each floor shall be
modeled with a separate HVAC system.  Floors with identical

I Agree with the interpretation, baseline (5 to 8) should be modelled with
one AHU system per unique floor. If say, the office building had 15
identical floors, then you would have three AHUs. first and last floor
would have different boundary conditions to the rest, so the simplified way
to model the baseline would be One AHU system for the first floor one for
the middle identical floors (with a load multiplier of 13) and one for the
last floor.

The original poster said he didn't have a LEED project, but you are correct that LEED has their own guidance on how to treat buildings and campuses while using 90.1 mostly as-is. Your project may have had unfortunate timing. I don't know if separating the buildings has been strictly enforced before now. Or if some may still pass through in some cases? This is one of the first times that I've heard of it coming up mid-stream as opposed to allowing the project team to help define which case it should use.

Although it seems like a lot of extra work to separate these two buildings for an NC certification, it would be consistent with eventual EB: O&M certification which would be based on separate ENERGY STAR accounts for the two buildings, so I can see the argument in favor.

I would hope that USGBC would allow you to have both buildings in a combined model as long as each had its own heating and cooling loops and electricity meters -- all pertinent energy usage, demand, and cost could be provided to the reviewer even if the model was combined. I think it's a step too far by the reviewers if they forced you to have two separate models.

Hi

I would like to add to this discussion, a couple of months ago we had an interesting review comment from LEED on this issue and it has rattled us a little. There is a definition of whether a building is one or two. Off the top of my head I can't remember where it is (sorry for that not terribly useful) but we had a two buildings connected by a corridor all fed with the same boiler and chiller. LEED specifically told us that because it was only connected by a corridor it had to be regarded as two separate buildings. We had to change LEED certifications and redo a huge amount of the energy model in order to split the energy usage in two. I would suggest that you contact LEED to check you are doing the right thing, it will save you hours of pain and money. This is all assuming you are doing LEED, I know that this definition was not in 90.1 it was somewhere else in LEED documentation.

I agree with the interpretation, paraphrased for clarity's sake:  15 separate baseline systems (one per floor), each with a number of VAV terminal units equal to the number of thermal blocks per floor (one per zone).

I speculate prior to 2007 folks (myself included) would generally match the quantity and arrangement of proposed systems where possible for baseline modeling.  Without the direction of "one per floor" it would mean, all else being equal, two different baseline models could have varying performance based solely on the design of the proposed systems... I speculate the 90.1 committee didn't want the baseline systems to influence/inform actual designs in such a fashion, so they chose to lock down system quantities using the "one per floor" language.  Arbitrary, yeah, but probably has a net effect of making baselines more uniform in performance across projects.  That's my best guess, fwiw.

I would add to Jim/Santiago's multiplier suggestion that while floor/system multipliers are something I'd also expect to use for a 15-story building, assuming you can arrange for identical zoning and so forth, you may find it less work on the documentation/review side of things to model each floor & system separately.  I caution this as I've run into reviewers needing hand-holding to understand what DOE2 system reports should look like when floor multipliers are in play, and I've also found on the front-end that baseline system calculations can become more complex considering the goal to clearly document how you arrived at your answers.  To be fair, more complex calculations for half as many (or fewer) systems in quantity can balance out and may be a wash too.

Food for thought - hope that helps =),

I ALWAYS model using the "Floors with identical thermal blocks can be grouped for modeling purposes" allowance, as long as it's thermodynamically appropriate.
Same operating schedule on all 15 floors?  Same setpoints?  Same plug loads and lighting?  What difference would it make to model 15 separate air handlers? (none)
One of my assessment criteria is "Can I explain what I did in front of a group of peers and expect that they'll agree with what I did?"  In this case, I think it would be very hard for them to disagree.

Yes, for ASHRAE 90.1-2007 and 2010 you will have 15 separate VAV AHUs (one per floor) in the baseline.  I'm not sure of the reasoning for the change unless it is simply for standardization of the number of baseline systems.

Thanks all for your input!

I agree that there isn't much room for interpretation regarding the floor-by-floor, and that the overall energy use between a baseline AHU configuration that isn't floor-by-floor versus one that is, probably won't differ so much-especially for buildings with homogeneous space types (ie all offices). The scenarios in which there might be a slightly bigger difference in annual energy use is for buildings with varied spacetypes and schedules (ie varied hourly power densities) and/or different comfort setpoints across a single floor, which may mean running this 'fictitious' floor-by-floor unit at the lower part of the system efficiency curve.

Does anyone know who added this line? Or how we can find out who wrote it?

I Agree with the interpretation, baseline (5 to 8) should be modelled with one AHU system per unique floor. If say, the office building had 15 identical floors, then you would have three AHUs. first and last floor would have different boundary conditions to the rest, so the simplified way to model the baseline would be One AHU system for the first floor one for the middle identical floors (with a load multiplier of 13) and one for the last floor.

Yes, for ASHRAE 90.1-2007 and 2010 you will have 15 separate VAV AHUs (one per floor) in the baseline.  I'm not sure of the reasoning for the change unless it is simply for standardization of the number of baseline systems.

All,

Can anyone share their experience with the modified baseline model HVAC description in ASHRAE 90.1 - 2007 and 2010? (copied below)  ASHRAE 90.1-2004 did not require the baseline model for systems 5,6,7 and 8 to have separate HVAC systems per floor and I'd like to hear how people have interpreted this and, if anyone can explain the reasoning for this.

For example, the proposed model of a 15 story office building might have 2 AHUs, one serving the east wing and one serving the west wing.  For the baseline per ASHRAE 90.1-2007 or 2010, will these 2 AHUs be replaced with 15 separate VAV units? Or can the 2 AHUs be kept as long as it satisfies the statement "Floors with identical thermal blocks can be grouped for modeling purposes"?

ASHRAE 90.1 - 2004
G3.1.1 Baseline HVAC System Type and Description.
HVAC systems in the baseline building design shall be based
on usage, number of floors, conditioned floor area, and heating
source as specified in Table G3.1.1A and shall conform
with the system descriptions in Table G3.1.1B.

Bldg-sim,
Standards have to provide some direction of how the baseline AHUs are configured.  While surely not perfect, the AHU per floor is the simplest and most sensible solution I have read.  Yes, I know different numbers of systems between two models is a pain in some software.  A one to one correlation with the proposed design often fails, for example when the proposed is zone heat pumps.   You can still overlay your other exceptions based on load intensity, hours of operation etc.    Before you gloss over the differences as negligible based on one homogenous project, remember all of the aspects that are tied to AHU size including fan power, economizer thresholds, and DX cooling efficiency.  On some projects in some locations those are very significant differences.
Happy modeling,

Thanks all for your input!

I agree that there isn't much room for interpretation regarding the floor-by-floor, and that the overall energy use between a baseline AHU configuration that isn't floor-by-floor versus one that is, probably won't differ so much-especially for buildings with homogeneous space types (ie all offices). The scenarios in which there might be a slightly bigger difference in annual energy use is for buildings with varied spacetypes and schedules (ie varied hourly power densities) and/or different comfort setpoints across a single floor, which may mean running this 'fictitious' floor-by-floor unit at the lower part of the system efficiency curve.

Does anyone know who added this line? Or how we can find out who wrote it?

Subject: RE: [Bldg-sim] ASHRAE 90.1 baseline HVAC sytem description

I agree with the interpretation, paraphrased for clarity's sake:  15 separate baseline systems (one per floor), each with a number of VAV terminal units equal to the number of thermal blocks per floor (one per zone).

I speculate prior to 2007 folks (myself included) would generally match the quantity and arrangement of proposed systems where possible for baseline modeling.  Without the direction of "one per floor" it would mean, all else being equal, two different baseline models could have varying performance based solely on the design of the proposed systems... I speculate the 90.1 committee didn't want the baseline systems to influence/inform actual designs in such a fashion, so they chose to lock down system quantities using the "one per floor" language.  Arbitrary, yeah, but probably has a net effect of making baselines more uniform in performance across projects.  That's my best guess, fwiw.

I would add to Jim/Santiago's multiplier suggestion that while floor/system multipliers are something I'd also expect to use for a 15-story building, assuming you can arrange for identical zoning and so forth, you may find it less work on the documentation/review side of things to model each floor & system separately.  I caution this as I've run into reviewers needing hand-holding to understand what DOE2 system reports should look like when floor multipliers are in play, and I've also found on the front-end that baseline system calculations can become more complex considering the goal to clearly document how you arrived at your answers.  To be fair, more complex calculations for half as many (or fewer) systems in quantity can balance out and may be a wash too.

Annie,
You can always certify these buildings together as LEED for Multiple Buildings:
http://www.usgbc.org/resources/leed-application-guide-multiple-buildings-and-campus-building-projects

If they share mechanical plant/equipment, you can put them together in one energy model.  I'm in the comment review phase on a 6 building certification healthcare project.  Two of the hospitals are served by the central plant building (with no other buildings served).  The energy model was performed with both hospital buildings and the central plant building in one model.  The other three buildings are multi-family apartment buildings with stand-alone mechanical equipment.  Those have been modeled individually in separate models.  The Baseline and Proposed energy costs are then all added up for all 4 models to calculate energy cost savings.  This aggregation is performed in a spreadsheet.  This methodology was confirmed with a GBCI CIR beforehand.

If you're certifying multiple buildings together, which it sounds like you are trying to, I've never had problems in the past putting independent buildings in one model (even if they don't share mechanical plant).  Hopefully this doesn't mark an about-face from GBCI on this topic.  The LEED reviewers have gotten better recently about direct communication with the design team.  I recommend you seek clarification from them before proceeding and using lots of hours.

Best of luck,

Hi

I would like to add to this discussion, a couple of months ago we had an interesting review comment from LEED on this issue and it has rattled us a little. There is a definition of whether a building is one or two. Off the top of my head I can't remember where it is (sorry for that not terribly useful) but we had a two buildings connected by a corridor all fed with the same boiler and chiller. LEED specifically told us that because it was only connected by a corridor it had to be regarded as two separate buildings. We had to change LEED certifications and redo a huge amount of the energy model in order to split the energy usage in two. I would suggest that you contact LEED to check you are doing the right thing, it will save you hours of pain and money. This is all assuming you are doing LEED, I know that this definition was not in 90.1 it was somewhere else in LEED documentation.

 Breathing Zone or Outdoor Air Intake
Message-ID: <8A29D97A76074909A9241603F594BCF7@MRENG.local>

Hi,

 

We've received a nice boost in some models in Canada lately as the Proposed
and Baseline designs only need to have the same amount of outdoor air in the
breathing zone under CaGBC Rules.  Meaning that if your baseline design is
VAV Reheat and your proposed design is chilled beam and baseboard heating
then your proposed design will have to condition somewhere in the range of
40% less outdoor air due to higher zone effectiveness and system efficiency.

Aaron,
ASHRAE 90.1-2007 Addendum bj allows modelers to take energy savings credit for HVAC systems that increase air distribution effectiveness and use demand control ventilation.  This can therefore result in different ventilation rates between Baseline and Proposed models.  USGBC allows modelers to apply any ASHRAE Addenda they want for that version of the standard as long as it is applied uniformly and clearly stated.

Hi,

We've received a nice boost in some models in Canada lately as the Proposed and Baseline designs only need to have the same amount of outdoor air in the breathing zone under CaGBC Rules.  Meaning that if your baseline design is VAV Reheat and your proposed design is chilled beam and baseboard heating then your proposed design will have to condition somewhere in the range of 40% less outdoor air due to higher zone effectiveness and system efficiency. It makes a lot of sense to me and becomes a significant energy savings measure.

Is this allowed by the USGBC or by ASHRAE?  I just read in 90.1 in G.3.1.2.5 that "Minimum outdoor air ventilation rates shall be the same for the proposed and baseline designs."  That doesn't specify whether they mean in the breathing zone or outdoor air intake but I think most assume it to be the outdoor air intake.

Scott,

 

Thanks, I see that came out in 2010 so it didn't make it into 90.1-2010.  

 

It allows you to claim credit for having zone effectiveness greater than 1.0
but doesn't allow you to claim system efficiency gains.

 

"Baseline  ventilation  airflow  rates  in  those

zones shall be calculated using the proposed design Ven-

tilation Rate  Procedure  calculation  with  the  following

change only.  Zone air distribution effectiveness shall be

changed to (Ez)=1.0 in each zone having a zone air distri-

bution effectiveness (Ez)>1.0."  

 

So if your Proposed has a DOAS and the Baseline is VAV, the baseline won't
meet Standard 62.

Hi,

 

We've received a nice boost in some models in Canada lately as the Proposed
and Baseline designs only need to have the same amount of outdoor air in the
breathing zone under CaGBC Rules.  Meaning that if your baseline design is
VAV Reheat and your proposed design is chilled beam and baseboard heating
then your proposed design will have to condition somewhere in the range of
40% less outdoor air due to higher zone effectiveness and system efficiency.
It makes a lot of sense to me and becomes a significant energy savings
measure.  

 

Is this allowed by the USGBC or by ASHRAE?  I just read in 90.1 in G.3.1.2.5
that "Minimum outdoor air ventilation rates shall be the same for the
proposed and baseline designs."  That doesn't specify whether they mean in
the breathing zone or outdoor air intake but I think most assume it to be
the outdoor air intake.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Minimum Ventilation Air in Proposed and Baseline - Breathing Zone or Outdoor Air Intake

Hi,

We've received a nice boost in some models in Canada lately as the Proposed and Baseline designs only need to have the same amount of outdoor air in the breathing zone under CaGBC Rules.  Meaning that if your baseline design is VAV Reheat and your proposed design is chilled beam and baseboard heating then your proposed design will have to condition somewhere in the range of 40% less outdoor air due to higher zone effectiveness and system efficiency. It makes a lot of sense to me and becomes a significant energy savings measure.

Is this allowed by the USGBC or by ASHRAE?  I just read in 90.1 in G.3.1.2.5 that "Minimum outdoor air ventilation rates shall be the same for the proposed and baseline designs."  That doesn't specify whether they mean in the breathing zone or outdoor air intake but I think most assume it to be the outdoor air intake.

Scott,

I had thought of that addendum but I don't think it applies in your case since it is meant for UFAD/displacement systems. You may be able to show some savings using G3.1.3.13 and saying that the minimum zone airflow rates are higher for the  baseline VAV system since it is not decoupled like your chilled beam/DOAS system. Baseline and proposed would still have the same minimum OA coming into the building but you would need to do a second OA calc to find what the zone minimums would be. I think it makes sense conceptually but I haven't tried it before so not sure if a reviewer would go for it. That being said they are generally pretty good about accepting atypical arguments for energy savings as long as you show your work in a fair amount of detail.

Scott,

Thanks, I see that came out in 2010 so it didn't make it into 90.1-2010.

It allows you to claim credit for having zone effectiveness greater than 1.0 but doesn't allow you to claim system efficiency gains.

"Baseline  ventilation  airflow  rates  in  those
zones shall be calculated using the proposed design Ven-
tilation Rate  Procedure  calculation  with  the  following
change only.  Zone air distribution effectiveness shall be
changed to (Ez)=1.0 in each zone having a zone air distri-
bution effectiveness (Ez)>1.0."

So if your Proposed has a DOAS and the Baseline is VAV, the baseline won't meet Standard 62.

Aaron,
ASHRAE 90.1-2007 Addendum bj allows modelers to take energy savings credit for HVAC systems that increase air distribution effectiveness and use demand control ventilation.  This can therefore result in different ventilation rates between Baseline and Proposed models.  USGBC allows modelers to apply any ASHRAE Addenda they want for that version of the standard as long as it is applied uniformly and clearly stated.

Thanks Brendan,

 

This question wasn't for a specific project, it came up because it is
accepted by the CaGBC (in Canada) but didn't seem to be something that the
USGBC or ASHRAE had ruled on.

Message-ID: <BLU176-W13801725CC7DC6499CCC9DC3D80@phx.gbl>

I have a question regarding motor efficiency, we are on a project that is looking LEED V2.2 certification. We need to install rolling doors, these doors have two motors each one and motors are 2HP. Our LEED assosor told us that the motor should meet ASHRAE 90.1-2004 efficiency. I think they don?t have to meet because they will be used two or three times per day. The manufacturer (Canadian) told us that motors have 75% efficiency, and according to ASHRAE they need to be 84%. 
Do we really need to meet ASHRAE efficiency? is there any way to be exempt? I will say the motors will serve a special purpose and don?t need to meet efficiency. 
Can you help me and see if I really need to comply with efficiency?

Printing what, newspapers or something else?
I published an ASHRAE paper on conditioning a printing works several years ago, this may help?

It's a book-printing facility, with book binding machine and all.
Yes, I think that will help. What is the details of the paper?

An updated version of EnergyPlusToFMU is now available at
http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/fmu/EnergyPlus/export/index.html

 

EnergyPlusToFMU is a software package written in Python which allows users
to export the building simulation program EnergyPlus version 8.0 or higher 

 

as a Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) for co-simulation using the Functional
Mock-up Interface (FMI) standard version 1.0. This FMU can then be imported
into 

 

a variety of simulation programs that support the import of the Functional
Mock-up Interface for co-simulation. This capability allows for instance to
model the envelope 

 

of a building in EnergyPlus, export the model as an FMU, import and link the
model with an HVAC system model developed in a system simulation tool such
as the Modelica environment Dymola.

Ery, try this?

 

Thermal storage incorporated in the mechanical system for printing works to
offset peak loads

The electrical consumption of a printing works can be reduced by utilising
thermal storage loads. In order to achieve a balance between 100% outdoor
air and conditioned air, different ventilation schemes were compared. The
subsequent cooling load derived from the comparison was further evaluated to
see if a chiller plant together with a thermal storage system would reduce
energy costs.

<Please excuse cross postings>

Following on from the success of our last Design Optimisation Competition (www.designbuilder.co.uk/content/view/135/206/) the ADOPT (www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~adopt/wiki/doku.php) research partners are pleased to announce a new competition which offers the opportunity to use the latest DesignBuilder Optimisation tools to solve a challenging building design problem.

[cid:image002.png at 01CEFB5C.C5D9EE80]<http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~adopt/wiki/doku.php?id=competition:submissions>

The purpose of the competition is to promote awareness of a new breed of optimisation tools which can help with decision making at any stage of the design process. These tools provide powerful techniques for identifying optimal designs that meet potentially conflicting design requirements such as minimising environmental impact while also minimising development costs and at the same time satisfying constraints such as providing minimum levels of occupant comfort.

Prizes will be awarded for the most cost effective and environmentally friendly design meeting a challenging functional and performance specification. The first prize will be 500 GBP cash plus an Advanced Simulation Package. Runner up prizes will also be provided.

The competition is open to all comers including professional consultants, academics and students and we particularly support use of the competition as part of University building energy modelling teaching modules.
Participants will get advance access to the DesignBuilder Optimisation software, which will help give them the best possible chance of winning the competition. Optimisation requires many hundreds of simulations to be carried out to perform an accurate analysis. In DesignBuilder these simulations can be run in parallel on your local machine, on a network server or for the fastest results over the internet on the De Montfort University high performance supercomputer. We expect many participants will take DMU up on their generous offer to use this powerful resource at no cost during the competition.

A free Webinar will be held on 14 January 2014 at 15:00 GMT to provide more detailed information on the competition and also on the new DesignBuilder Optimisation tools. Whether you are interested in taking part in the competition, or you would just like to know more about the latest optimisation tools, you are warmly invited to attend.

Anyone could explain what is the different between gbXML and Functional
Mock-up Interface (FMI) which for me it seems they are doing the same
exchange of model physical/internal information!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] DES Option 1 Pump Power
Message-ID: <01D1D17822CC9A42A183AFD8AF282D39E2941A9295@wattsexch.wattsae.local>

Hello, I am reviewing an energy model and associated LEED comment for a DES project that is modeled using Option 1 (stand-alone scenario), there is no specific reference to pump power within the guidance document.  The LEED comment states:

"Since the project follows the DES guidance Option 1, only the Baseline secondary distribution loop from Appendix G, with the relevant pump and loop parameters from that secondary loop must be modeled. Additionally, since the distribution loop for hot water is a primary-only loop that includes both upstream and downstream equipment, this option is not available for purchased steam or hot water, and the Baseline Case hot water pumps must be modeling identically in the Baseline and Proposed Cases based on the Proposed Case values.

I believe the directive here is to model the baseline pumps identical to the proposed and equal to the proposed values.  The LEED review comment states that the loop includes upstream equipment when Option 1 is specifically to exclude upstream equipment and model stand-alone.  The energy source is purchased heat.

I think the problem is that I see that the steam coils in the roof-top units are modeled in the same loop as the HW terminal units.  If I separate these into two loops I should be able to claim energy savings for the pump power associated with the HW terminal units.  Is this correct or is it still required to model the HW terminal unit pump power identical in baseline and proposed cases?
Thank you.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Fan power when changing baseline system per LEED
	District Energy rules
Message-ID: <CAOyQK8bXNBK14DkDhjCqUd=afmgppuwP=9OaYuPU9Kr-GSYRXw@mail.gmail.com>

I'm modeling a multifamily building that uses a campus plant for cooling.
I'm familiar with the USGBC document for modeling DES plants, and am
currently looking at Option 1, which is an energy neutral purchased chilled
water plant. Because the building is residential, the normal baseline
system is System 1-PTAC. The USGBC document says to change this to a 4-pipe
fan coil in order to make use of the purchased chilled water. Fair enough.

My problem is how to calculate fan power for this new baseline system. FCUs
are not a normal baseline system, so there's no direction in Appendix G.
Has anyone come across this before? If so, what did you do to calculate the
fan power?

For what it's worth, I see three options:
1) Since I'm replacing System 1, use the formula for System 1,
Pfan=CFMs*0.3. The resulting fan power is much lower than my proposed,
which is a bummer, though it's primarily due to 5 DOAS fans that of course
aren't in the baseline.

2) Allow TRACE to calculate the fan power using its built-in 90.1 features.
This number comes out much higher than the proposed fan power, which is
what tipped me off to this issue. I'm currently trying to back out how
Trace arrived at the fan power it did.

3) The proposed building uses fan coils. Since the new baseline also does,
set the fan powers equal and only receive credit from reduced run hours due
to improved envelope and such. This sounds like a nice way to guarantee
reviewer comments.

Any thoughts?

Thanks,

Message-ID: <CAOyQK8aK2ULeqr-rbO7S3cgm+Zu3YUorgpejgUAEnvevyuR83w@mail.gmail.com>

Regarding my earlier question, Trane TRACE is using the formula for CAV
Systems 3-4 when calculating 90.1 fan power with FCU as the baseline
system. In my case, I'm seeing a large benefit because the formula includes
motor efficiency, which is only 82.5% for most of the small single room
FCUs.

This gets me the most EAc1 points, so I am with only modest shame leaning
towards this approach. Does using this formula seem reasonable enough to
others in the modeling community?

Jason,

I would say that applies to fan power, so your Baseline FCUs should use the System 1 fan power Pfan(w)=CFMS*0.3.

For what it's worth, I see three options:
1) Since I'm replacing System 1, use the formula for System 1, Pfan=CFMs*0.3. The resulting fan power is much lower than my proposed, which is a bummer, though it's primarily due to 5 DOAS fans that of course aren't in the baseline.
2) Allow TRACE to calculate the fan power using its built-in 90.1 features. This number comes out much higher than the proposed fan power, which is what tipped me off to this issue. I'm currently trying to back out how Trace arrived at the fan power it did.
3) The proposed building uses fan coils. Since the new baseline also does, set the fan powers equal and only receive credit from reduced run hours due to improved envelope and such. This sounds like a nice way to guarantee reviewer comments.
Any thoughts?

Kevin,
Here's my interpretation of the LEED comment: An Option 1 heating loop is equivalent to a primary loop upstream with a secondary loop downstream. However, Appendix G requires heating loops to be modeled as primary-only. The baseline pump power allowance is based on a primary loop only, and there is no way (according to the LEED comment) to separate the primary loop pump power (which is excluded) from the secondary loop pump power. Therefore, the reviewer wants to see identical heating loop pump power in baseline and proposed.
However, in your case, your district/campus loop is a steam loop which you could argue has no pump power, which could potentially justify modeling 19W/gpm for the baseline heating loop and your actual separate steam and HW loops (from a steam-to-HW heat exchanger, correct?) in the proposed. Unless you get a more thorough review comment or find a CIR explaining it better, I would try that approach and explain it in detail with the revised submission.

Regards,
Bill

Subject: [Bldg-sim] DES Option 1 Pump Power

Hello, I am reviewing an energy model and associated LEED comment for a DES project that is modeled using Option 1 (stand-alone scenario), there is no specific reference to pump power within the guidance document.  The LEED comment states:

"Since the project follows the DES guidance Option 1, only the Baseline secondary distribution loop from Appendix G, with the relevant pump and loop parameters from that secondary loop must be modeled. Additionally, since the distribution loop for hot water is a primary-only loop that includes both upstream and downstream equipment, this option is not available for purchased steam or hot water, and the Baseline Case hot water pumps must be modeling identically in the Baseline and Proposed Cases based on the Proposed Case values.

I believe the directive here is to model the baseline pumps identical to the proposed and equal to the proposed values.  The LEED review comment states that the loop includes upstream equipment when Option 1 is specifically to exclude upstream equipment and model stand-alone.  The energy source is purchased heat.

I think the problem is that I see that the steam coils in the roof-top units are modeled in the same loop as the HW terminal units.  If I separate these into two loops I should be able to claim energy savings for the pump power associated with the HW terminal units.  Is this correct or is it still required to model the HW terminal unit pump power identical in baseline and proposed cases?
Thank you.

I'm modeling a multifamily building that uses a campus plant for cooling. I'm familiar with the USGBC document for modeling DES plants, and am currently looking at Option 1, which is an energy neutral purchased chilled water plant. Because the building is residential, the normal baseline system is System 1-PTAC. The USGBC document says to change this to a 4-pipe fan coil in order to make use of the purchased chilled water. Fair enough.
My problem is how to calculate fan power for this new baseline system. FCUs are not a normal baseline system, so there's no direction in Appendix G. Has anyone come across this before? If so, what did you do to calculate the fan power?

Jason,
If the DOAS fan power is what is driving you over the top on your proposed
model, how are you dealing with outside air in the baseline?  If the added
energy consumption for the FCU's handling all of the OA without heat
recovery in the baseline is not offsetting the DOAS fan power then look at
how the FCU fans in the baseline are bing controlled.  I would assume since
it is a residence or dorm the FCU fans have to run 24/7 at constant volume
to handle the required ventilation and the district chilled water and
district hot water (if that is your heat source) have to expend a lot more
energy to treat the ventilation than the DOAS with heat recovery.  Just a
thought.
Dennis

Wahid

gbXML and the Functional Mockup Interface (FMI) standard address very
different aspects of information exchange:

gbXML (http://www.gbxml.org/), similar than IFC (
http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/), has been developed to exchange
building parameters and simulation results between CAD systems and building
simulation programs, among other domains. The data are for example
parameters that describe building materials, dimension of constructions,
internal heat gain profiles, and outputs of simulation runs. gbXML contains
no executable code that for example computes energy use for a set of input
data, it only contains the inputs and outputs that are fed into or
retrieved from a simulator or a CAD system, using a syntax that is defined
in the standard. It addresses the problem of how to exchange data among
tools and users along the life cycle of buildings.

FMI (https://www.fmi-standard.org/) has been developed to exchange
simulators (the FMI for co-simulation standard) and models (the FMI for
model-exchange standard) in a tool independent standard. By model, I mean a
computer code that given some input, computes outputs such as room
temperatures and energy use (co-simulation) or time rate of change of
temperatures and energy (model exchange). What does this enable? With FMI,
you can develop a simulation model, or a controller or a fault detection
and diagnostics algorithm, export it in a standardized format as a
so-called Functional Mockup Unit, and then import it into a variety of
simulation tools (https://www.fmi-standard.org/tools), into a building
automation system (through an interface for Niagara AX that is currently in
development at LBNL), interface it with your own code or run it on the
cloud (http://www.xogeny.com/products/). All this is done in a tool
independent way; as long as your tool can export code as an FMU, you can
make use of this software ecosystem, that was typically developed for a
variety of application domains. There is an international project underway
(IEA EBC Annex 60, http://iea-annex60.org/) that further develops FMI
compliant applications for buildings.

All the best,

Michael

The review comments seems to imply that a secondary distribution loop is necessary because of the DES guidance.
Stating, "..loop parameters from that secondary loop must be modeled."
It also states that, "..hot water pumps must be modeling identically in the Baseline and Proposed Cases based on the Proposed Case values."

Anyways, the review comment is confusing because it seems to be quite poorly written.
"..this option is not available for purchased steam or hot water".  What option?  Option 1?
Separate the upstream and downstream equipment and make primary loops out of everything it is then.

Kevin,
Here's my interpretation of the LEED comment: An Option 1 heating loop is equivalent to a primary loop upstream with a secondary loop downstream. However, Appendix G requires heating loops to be modeled as primary-only. The baseline pump power allowance is based on a primary loop only, and there is no way (according to the LEED comment) to separate the primary loop pump power (which is excluded) from the secondary loop pump power. Therefore, the reviewer wants to see identical heating loop pump power in baseline and proposed.
However, in your case, your district/campus loop is a steam loop which you could argue has no pump power, which could potentially justify modeling 19W/gpm for the baseline heating loop and your actual separate steam and HW loops (from a steam-to-HW heat exchanger, correct?) in the proposed. Unless you get a more thorough review comment or find a CIR explaining it better, I would try that approach and explain it in detail with the revised submission.

Bill

Hello, I am reviewing an energy model and associated LEED comment for a DES project that is modeled using Option 1 (stand-alone scenario), there is no specific reference to pump power within the guidance document.  The LEED comment states:

"Since the project follows the DES guidance Option 1, only the Baseline secondary distribution loop from Appendix G, with the relevant pump and loop parameters from that secondary loop must be modeled. Additionally, since the distribution loop for hot water is a primary-only loop that includes both upstream and downstream equipment, this option is not available for purchased steam or hot water, and the Baseline Case hot water pumps must be modeling identically in the Baseline and Proposed Cases based on the Proposed Case values.

I believe the directive here is to model the baseline pumps identical to the proposed and equal to the proposed values.  The LEED review comment states that the loop includes upstream equipment when Option 1 is specifically to exclude upstream equipment and model stand-alone.  The energy source is purchased heat.

I think the problem is that I see that the steam coils in the roof-top units are modeled in the same loop as the HW terminal units.  If I separate these into two loops I should be able to claim energy savings for the pump power associated with the HW terminal units.  Is this correct or is it still required to model the HW terminal unit pump power identical in baseline and proposed cases?
Thank you.

I've been pondering this one as well. I'm imagining that if we say "DES = purchased heat = boiler" then Appendix G would want to have 19 W/gpm pumps primary to the building.  But on the other hand, that 19 W/gpm comes from an assumption of a boiler which may have a higher pressure drop than the HX or secondary loop connection in your case. If your proposed building has a secondary loop off of a campus distributed hot water system, then the allowance for 19 W/gpm is probably generous.

The wording is also ambiguous - the building could be considered "primary" if the connection to DES was a heat exchanger rather than a secondary pumping configuration. If you did go to Option 2, then the losses of the steam system or heating hot water system would be accounted for there.

I'd leave the steam vs HW argument out of it - you'd be claiming a pumping energy "benefit" in model space that ignores some real world losses for condensate recovery, losses in the piping, etc. Where the proposed is steam all the way to the coils, I think the baseline should also neglect pumping energy.

The interesting part of this project is that it sounds like it has district steam and primary heating hot water provided to the building? If so then stick with what the reviewer suggested.

If I'm not grasping the scenario and the building receives steam that is used directly in preheat coils and through a heat exchanger to create hot water for use in terminal units, then I think the 19 W/gpm should be allowed for the pumped portion only. I think this would also apply if the heating hot water was through a heat exchanger to allow for pressure drop of the heat exchanger.

What was your W/gpm for the proposed case? If the proposed is way less than the baseline I think we are missing something and the reviewer may be correct.

The last scenario applies, just as stated, the steam coils were modeled in the same loop as the terminal units.  I revised each into separate loops and separate meters to make sure they could be modeled as "primary loops".  As you know, a portion of the building contains spaces that have minimum air change requirements.  These spaces are modeled as CV per guidance using system type SZRH.  Therefore only the spaces that do not have minimum air change requirements may claim energy savings on pump power for zone equipment.  The W/gpm for the Proposed case is 11.7.  Is this excessively low?

Kind Regards,
Kevin

The Low Exergy Module of the Future Cities Laboratory (
http://www.futurecities.ethz.ch/) in Singapore seeks candidates for four
open positions in an applied research project in the field of building
systems in humid climates.

Details for all positions can be found at:
http://www.suat.arch.ethz.ch/en/open-positions

Inquiries and applications can be emailed to Dr. Matthias Mast (
mast at arch.ethz.ch): http://www.futurecities.ethz.ch/person/dr-matthias-mast/

The research of the Low Exergy Module focuses on exploring, simulating and
testing of new high performance building systems and the integrated design
of high performance buildings. The 3for2 pilot project addresses the
transfer of technology and design aspects developed and tested at the
Future Cities Laboratory into a real-world building in Singapore. As part
of this pilot implementation, a section of a building in Singapore will be
built based on our technology and design concepts. This integrated pilot
implementation includes structural elements, new fa?ade solutions and novel
high-performance technology for air-conditioning.

Hi, Jason.

With all due respect to Trane TRACE, I have not found their built-in PRM Fan Calculator to accurately reflect the equations and methods in ASHRAE 90.1, Appendix G, particularly related to the way they handle the 'A' fan power credit.  Verify it for yourself, but I would calculate baseline fan power outside the software.

Thanks,

Jason,
If the DOAS fan power is what is driving you over the top on your proposed model, how are you dealing with outside air in the baseline?  If the added energy consumption for the FCU's handling all of the OA without heat recovery in the baseline is not offsetting the DOAS fan power then look at how the FCU fans in the baseline are bing controlled.  I would assume since it is a residence or dorm the FCU fans have to run 24/7 at constant volume to handle the required ventilation and the district chilled water and district hot water (if that is your heat source) have to expend a lot more energy to treat the ventilation than the DOAS with heat recovery.  Just a thought.
Dennis

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Fan power when changing baseline system per LEED District Energy rules


I'm modeling a multifamily building that uses a campus plant for cooling. I'm familiar with the USGBC document for modeling DES plants, and am currently looking at Option 1, which is an energy neutral purchased chilled water plant. Because the building is residential, the normal baseline system is System 1-PTAC. The USGBC document says to change this to a 4-pipe fan coil in order to make use of the purchased chilled water. Fair enough.
My problem is how to calculate fan power for this new baseline system. FCUs are not a normal baseline system, so there's no direction in Appendix G. Has anyone come across this before? If so, what did you do to calculate the fan power?
For what it's worth, I see three options:
1) Since I'm replacing System 1, use the formula for System 1, Pfan=CFMs*0.3. The resulting fan power is much lower than my proposed, which is a bummer, though it's primarily due to 5 DOAS fans that of course aren't in the baseline.
2) Allow TRACE to calculate the fan power using its built-in 90.1 features. This number comes out much higher than the proposed fan power, which is what tipped me off to this issue. I'm currently trying to back out how Trace arrived at the fan power it did.
3) The proposed building uses fan coils. Since the new baseline also does, set the fan powers equal and only receive credit from reduced run hours due to improved envelope and such. This sounds like a nice way to guarantee reviewer comments.
Any thoughts?
Thanks,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Appendix G Secondary Pump Control
Message-ID: <001501cefd8d$ebca8fe0$c35fafa0$@sudassociates.com>

I have a question regarding 90.1 2004 Appendix G baseline chilled water pump
control.  Section 3.1.3.10 says that baseline CHW systems must be
primary/secondary, with a constant flow primary loop and a variable flow
secondary loop.  The secondary pump will either ride the curve or be
controlled by a VSD depending on square footage.  In the case I currently
have in my hands, the pump rides the curve.  No questions yet. 

 

Section 3.1.3.11 goes on to state that each chiller shall have its own
condenser water and chilled water pumps, interlocked to operate with the
chiller.  This is clear and reasonable for the condenser water and primary
chilled water pumps, but what about secondary chilled water pumps?  For my
current application (one chiller, pump riding curve), my question simply
boils down to whether I should turn the secondary pump off when the chiller
is off, or if I should run it all of the time.  

  

But to get into it a little more, here are three approaches I see:

 

1.       Model one secondary pump for each chiller, and turn each pump off
when its associated chiller turns off.  Section 3.1.3.10 is titled Chilled
Water Pumps, and that section includes both primary and secondary pumps, so
when the next section references "chilled water pumps" that should include
both primary and secondary.  However, this does not reflect the typical
reality of one secondary pump serving multiple chillers, and the common
interpretation that only a primary pump has one single associated chiller.

 

2.       Model one secondary pump regardless of how many chillers there are,
and turn it off when all chillers are off.  This is perhaps most similar to
what you might expect in a 'real' system.  If you only have one chiller (as
I currently have), this is exactly the same as approach 1.  

 

3.       Model one secondary pump regardless of how many chillers there are,
and never turn it off.  Many buildings are unfortunately operated this way.
This approach significantly increases baseline energy when the pump is
riding the curve.

 

I have always used approach 2 without putting much thought into it.  But now
my results are highly dependent on which approach I take, and I see enough
ambiguity that arguments could be made for approach 3.  

 

Your thoughts?

 

Thanks,

Christian

Christian,
I always model one secondary pump for the baseline. I see no reason to do otherwise.
My approach to loop activation has been to model it the same as the proposed design. Using DOE-2 for example, it could be SCHEDULED to run 24/7 during cooling months, or DEMAND-ONLY to stay off until a coil or process load exists. If the proposed design has no CHW plant, but has a boiler/HHW plant, you could model the baseline CHW loop activation similarly to the proposed HHW loop. If the proposed design has no analogous loop operation, you just have to make a judgement call, but I am not aware of any guidance in 90.1 or LEED. Also keep in mind that 22W/gpm is the total pump power allowance for all your primary/secondary CHW pumps, and not the power of each pump.

Bill

Bill,

 

Thanks.  Yes, the 22W/gpm total requirement is still fresh in my mind from
the recent discussion on this forum!

 

I understand your approach to pump control.  But.would you be able to defend
that approach if someone (like your client) pushed you about why you aren't
getting them better savings by running your secondary CHW pump 8760?
Certainly the 90.1 folks had some specific intent, whether they made it
clear or not.

Christian

This approach significantly increases baseline energy when the pump is
riding the curve.

 

I have always used approach 2 without putting much thought into it.  But now
my results are highly dependent on which approach I take, and I see enough
ambiguity that arguments could be made for approach 3.  

 

Your thoughts?

 

Thanks,

Christian

To clarify an email I sent to the last thread on the 22 W / gpm:  I
recently received the updated documentation spreadsheet for a v4 pilot
project, and they have updated the notes.  Not sure if this image will
come thru to everybody, so here's what it says:

 

"The sum of primary and secondary must be 22 W / gpm (349 KW/1000 L/s)
per G3.1.3.10.  Recommended that the pump power be split as one third
(primary) and two-thirds (secondary)."

Bill,

 

Thanks.  Yes, the 22W/gpm total requirement is still fresh in my mind
from the recent discussion on this forum!

 

I understand your approach to pump control.  But...would you be able to
defend that approach if someone (like your client) pushed you about why
you aren't getting them better savings by running your secondary CHW
pump 8760?  Certainly the 90.1 folks had some specific intent, whether
they made it clear or not...

Christian,

I always model one secondary pump for the baseline. I see no reason to
do otherwise.

My approach to loop activation has been to model it the same as the
proposed design. Using DOE-2 for example, it could be SCHEDULED to run
24/7 during cooling months, or DEMAND-ONLY to stay off until a coil or
process load exists. If the proposed design has no CHW plant, but has a
boiler/HHW plant, you could model the baseline CHW loop activation
similarly to the proposed HHW loop. If the proposed design has no
analogous loop operation, you just have to make a judgement call, but I
am not aware of any guidance in 90.1 or LEED. Also keep in mind that
22W/gpm is the total pump power allowance for all your primary/secondary
CHW pumps, and not the power of each pump.

Regards,

Bill

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Appendix G Secondary Pump Control

 

I have a question regarding 90.1 2004 Appendix G baseline chilled water
pump control.  Section 3.1.3.10 says that baseline CHW systems must be
primary/secondary, with a constant flow primary loop and a variable flow
secondary loop.  The secondary pump will either ride the curve or be
controlled by a VSD depending on square footage.  In the case I
currently have in my hands, the pump rides the curve.  No questions yet.


 

Section 3.1.3.11 goes on to state that each chiller shall have its own
condenser water and chilled water pumps, interlocked to operate with the
chiller.  This is clear and reasonable for the condenser water and
primary chilled water pumps, but what about secondary chilled water
pumps?  For my current application (one chiller, pump riding curve), my
question simply boils down to whether I should turn the secondary pump
off when the chiller is off, or if I should run it all of the time.  

  

But to get into it a little more, here are three approaches I see:

 

1.      Model one secondary pump for each chiller, and turn each pump
off when its associated chiller turns off.  Section 3.1.3.10 is titled
Chilled Water Pumps, and that section includes both primary and
secondary pumps, so when the next section references "chilled water
pumps" that should include both primary and secondary.  However, this
does not reflect the typical reality of one secondary pump serving
multiple chillers, and the common interpretation that only a primary
pump has one single associated chiller.

 

2.      Model one secondary pump regardless of how many chillers there
are, and turn it off when all chillers are off.  This is perhaps most
similar to what you might expect in a 'real' system.  If you only have
one chiller (as I currently have), this is exactly the same as approach
1.  

 

3.      Model one secondary pump regardless of how many chillers there
are, and never turn it off.  Many buildings are unfortunately operated
this way.  This approach significantly increases baseline energy when
the pump is riding the curve.

 

I have always used approach 2 without putting much thought into it.  But

Big Brother GBCI has eyes and ears everywhere... =)

I for one am very happy for clearer direction coming about on this point.  For reference, I think that same recent conversation brought about a reference I kept note of for ASHRAE interpretation IC 90.1-2007-14, which ruled that 22 W/GPM is a "whole system" power requirement, similar to Pfan for baseline fan calculations.

The one-third / two-thirds split is to my knowledge new direction, (I have previously simply dumped it all baseline pumping power onto secondary pump for simplicity of documentation - perhaps to my own detriment in certain cases), but I can empathize the reasoning behind providing such direction where distribution of pumping power could (in some cases) affect overall baseline performance.

Thanks very much for sharing James!

John,
I'm not sure how you have to report your CEU's or how technical or
discipline specific your training needs are, however, if you can self
report - two subscription services that seem to offer some fairly high
quality courses in numerous topics, Revit, Bentley, Word, Excel, C++,
Access, SQL Server, etc. are Lynda.com
(http://www.lynda.com/<http://www.lynda.com/member.aspx>)
and Infinite Skills.  Annual premium subscription to Lynda is around
$325.00 and to Infinite Skills (http://www.infiniteskills.com/)  is about
$120.00.  With both sites you can track your courses and your progress.

Are you familiar with Schneider Electric's "Energy University"?  A number of associations and organizations (including USGBC and BPI) approve their FREE online courses for continuing education credit requirements. See the list here:

http://www2.schneider-electric.com/sites/corporate/en/products-services/training/energy-university/endorsements-and-education-credits.page

The courses are online, and they have a nice progress tracking system.

Hope you find it useful...

Are you familiar with Schneider Electric's "Energy University"?  A number of associations and organizations (including USGBC and BPI) approve their FREE online courses for continuing education credit requirements. See the list here:

http://www2.schneider-electric.com/sites/corporate/en/products-services/training/energy-university/endorsements-and-education-credits.page

The courses are online, and they have a nice progress tracking system.

Hope you find it useful...

All the Best,

_Chris
