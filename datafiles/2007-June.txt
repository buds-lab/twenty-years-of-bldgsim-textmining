International Plumbing Code is a start for determining demand.  The demand will depend on the number of fixtures, which are derived from the architectural layout & size.

FYI.

The ASHRAE Handbook has curves for design sizing. Also, there have been papers in the ACEEE proceedings.

Also, try the FMI.

John,
 
Having simulated a number of laboratory buildings for LEED NC 2.1, I
don't see any way around the inclusion of the 'process spaces' in your
ECB analysis. LEED  NC 2.1 does let you subtract out the plug/process
loads when calculating the percentage energy reduction versus the ECB
baseline, but I'm guessing that your building has a high ventilation
load combined with large static pressures on supply and exhaust fans
that are driving the energy consumption of the building. Unfortunately,
the CIR's that have been answered on this issue are pretty clear that
you cannot exclude these spaces from the ECB analysis. 
 
The way to mitigate this issue is look very carefully at the fan power
of the building design and, in particular, the fan power credits allowed
under 6.3.3.1. Take as much credit in the baseline for supply
temperature, filtration, and heat recovery as you reasonably can. In
addition, perform a rigorous calculation of the fan power requirements
of your design. In many buildings of this type, fan power gets grossly
oversized. One project I worked on was calling for 9 in. w.g.. of static
on the lab system supply fans. After a more careful analysis, the MEP
concluded that they only needed about 6 in. w.g.. static to satisfy
their airflow requirements.
 
Other aspects of 90.1-1999 to pay particular attention to are sections
6.3.6 and 6.3.7 on energy recovery and exhaust hoods respectively.

Has anyone managed to exclude interior laboratory spaces from LEED
evaluations?  We have a project under LEED 2.1 where we would like to
not include the interior process spaces.  Having them included would
detract from energy, materials, water use reduction, lighting and
ventilation credit requirements.  Any direction on discussion would be
greatly appreciated.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200706111204.AA0450562pd80001434377@gard.com>

Hi Everyone,

We are evalulating energy savings from an IDEC system for a LEED office
building with eQUEST, and ran into a huge gas penalty. To maximize the
savings, all supply air passes through the IDEC system. Our conversations
with other modelers indicated many of them had similar problem. I was
wondering if there is a good explanation for this gas consumption increase
and whether there is a right way to simulate the IDEC if the gas penalty is
a bug. Thanks.

8:00 PM (approx)    After-dinner talk:  Kelly Speakes, United Technologies Corp.
Kelly Speakes is presently sustainable strategies leader and a UTC representative to the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) Energy Efficiency in Buildings (EEB) Project. Speakes has been active for ten years in the distributed and decentralized generation markets, representing global providers of equipment and services. She is the author of several published articles in energy trade magazines such as Power Economics and Energy Central. Speakes holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from Boston University.
 
Kelly's talk will include an overview and status of the EEB project.  See the full abstract below:
 
The World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) is a coalition of 190 multi-national corporations whose shared commitment to sustainable development and practices are recognized around the world.  In 2006, the WCBSD launched the Energy Efficiency in Buildings (EEB) Project, a three year effort led by co-chairs Lafarge and United Technologies Corporation, with a vision of a world where buildings consume zero net energy. The 10 member companies of the project, many of which are Fortune 500 companies in the field of building products and services, represent the voice of business in their effort to issue and promote a comprehensive and credible action plan to achieve the vision, focusing on six key global markets:  Brazil, China, Europe, India, Japan, and US.
 
Buildings consume roughly 40% of the world's energy resources and are a significant contributor to carbon emissions. In the urgency to transform the building sector, a zero net energy building is an aggressive and necessary response to global energy and climate change issues.  These actions can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of the world's cities. In the short term, energy efficiency improvements can be achieved through a holistic approach to building design, construction and operation, driven by increased awareness and changes in behavior. In the longer term, facilitation by process and information technology, products and services that support these outcomes, financial mechanisms to prove them economically viable and balanced encouragement through policy and regulation are necessary to transform the industry. 
 
By summer 2007 this three year effort will assess the current state of the building industry and analyze the opportunities and barriers.  By May 2008, conduct scenario analysis to overcome financial and institutional barriers that inhibit zero net energy buildings. By May 2009, issue and promote a comprehensive and credible action plan, using stakeholder roadmap validation.
 
This presentation will include an overview and status of the EEB project. The project's key themes of market perceptions that shape financial mechanisms and institutional barriers, holistic technical approaches, and behaviors and awareness will be discussed.  Finally, the presentation will provide an assessment on the role of equipment and energy efficiency improvements and standards in driving down overall energy consumption in the US in various commercial and consumer product areas.

                                                          
Reservations:      To make a reservation contact Peter Ellis < peter_ellis at nrel.gov> via email by June 19, 2007, 5 PM (MDT).  Confirmation of reservations will be sent via email (if you do not receive a confirmation within two business days, please resend your reservation request).

ASHRAE 90.1 2004 Appendix G has pressure credits for filters, but not
for
energy recovery devices.

Thus, it would appear that any situation where energy recovery is
required,
the as designed fan system is at a disadvantage since the baseline fan
bhp
is calculated without any pressure credit, but the as design system is
sized
to include the pressure drop through the energy recovery device.  I've
looked for interpretations on this, but could not find any.  Does
anyone
know of a ruling on this?

 

Thanks,

Mike

Molly,

I checked the NCDC data base of International Surface Observations for nearly 20,000 locations. There is an Ensenada weather station, but with extremely little data. Your best bet is to use San Diego TMY2, which is just 70 miles up the coast, or if you want to get marginally closer, there's Imperial Beach Ream Field NAS  right at the border, but that's raw historical data that you would have to convert to a simulation-friendly weather file.

I am modeling a 40,000 square foot elementary school in Sunnyside WA with
eQuest. The baseline utility cost is around $24,000 a year, for a four pipe
fan coil system. When I add DCV zone sensors the cost jumps to $30,000. I
would like to know if there is some setting that I am not dealing with to
have these sensors work properly. At this point I just select DCV zone
sensors for the minimum outside air control method.

 

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Residential Attic Fans........
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200706041532.AA3216343pd80001431312@gard.com>

In the old archived Emails I ran across a message saying Attic fans are 
not economically warranted.
No electrical   $/ KWH was mentioned, nor was the location, or the 
choice of blowing or suction operation. Combinations of location and 
operation have produced measureable differences in the Sterling.tmy 
climate.... On a gable roof house facing 150 to 210 deg  mounting the 
fan on the East gable and blowing in works best.  As a second tier 
effect a suction fan used in a house with an interior heated space attic 
access can have increased air infiltration if the hatch is not well 
sealed - and that is probably the warmest air in the house.

Has anyone studied the effects of running an attic fan operated B or S  
on attic located flex return air ducts during air conditioning season ???

Has anyone studied the changes in air infiltration from using foil 
backed sheet rock in the upstairs ceiling only.......

Any information or pointers would be appreciated.
Thanks,

John R Ross  P.E.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200706041507.AA0757250pd80001431258@gard.com>

I recently ran a series of  1536 sq ft  single story residential 
buildings, starting with 48 ft x32 ft,
changing the aspect ratio but leaving everything else the same. Then I 
changed the roof from flat to attic and ran  it again using Energy 10 
V1.8.  There was almost no difference in annual fuel consumption at all 
from the aspect ratio changes.....The treatment of "attic" is not well 
explained -- is the insulation flat on the floor or along the rafters? I 
was told earlier that the areas for each face of the roof  were in the 
plane of the roof not the flat projection, so we just increased the 
surface area..
Do we add the gable ends to the wall areas ?

I cannot get a daylighting / SDHW / PV run to work on a nonsample 
problem. The Eplus bombs, etc.  <Windows 98SE, Pentium 3 / 800Mhz, 256 
MB memory,> {hey the Energyplus is on the
new machine don't laugh }

I keep getting another error  that I can't have more that one roof face 
with just one heating
zone, yet under E10 V1.6 I used one upstairs zone and one basement zone 
to analyze an L shaped Hip roof house, resulting in 6 roof faces and 
everything was OK.  Comparison to the real house went well with the 
differences being easily explained.

Is there a set of reference cases that we can run to compare EnergyPlus 
runs to EQuest runs  to Energy 10 runs?  Say a one floor residential, 
two floor residential, commercial midrise 3 to 4 story,
and a commerial high rise.

We have a "Translation Station" , an old P III / 800 Mhz that runs 
Windows 98SE.
It has 5.25 Floppy, 3.5 Floppy,  and QIC 120, QIC 250,  QIC 250 XL, 
Travan 1, Travan 2,
Travan 3,  3010, and 3020 tape capability; a SCSI  U/W CD-R and scanner, 
two USB ports,
and .....  a  Zip 250 EIDE drive. It also has a RAID 0  array  of 2x40 
GB ATA100 Barracudas.
Unfortunately I sold my awesome dual external enclosure  DS DD half 
height 8" floppy drives (Shugart of course) a while ago........

If you have the 5.25 floppies and need them updated let me know.......

Hi,
I had 3 questions:
   
-Are elevator shafts considered part of Conditioned Spaces in Simulation Model ? 
(I recently excluded them and there seemed to be a substantial difference in the energy consumption,using equest).
 
-If restrooms are served by the same AHU but with a different supply air rate (as well as an exclusive outside air supply), should they be taken as a seperate zone?
 
  -If the windows I have assigned in equest show up only on the ground floor and not the middle floors in the model,  does it mean the floor multiplier is working? 
  
Thanks,
Kapil.

Ryan,

eQuest doesn't the capability to model VRV systems.  I recently modeled
a VRV system in a beta version of EnergyPro that can model a specific
manufacturer of VRV systems.  The results were similar to recently
published data on expected energy savings from the technology.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200706011246.AA4652312pd80001429974@gard.com>

I just want to let everyone know that the 189P Standard, "Standard for the Design of High-Performance Green Buildings" is available for public review (see note below). What I find interesting is that Appendix G, which is informational only in 90.1 is now being introduced as a normative appendix (called Appendix D in 189P). From previous comments on Bldg-Sim, I gather that there are alot of issues with Appendix G, if it becomes normative under 189P the Bldg-Sim community may become bound by this rule set. Thus, I believe it is important for the Bldg-Sim community to make comments that will improve on Appendix G (or D).
 
Regards,
 
Harvey Bryan
 
 
Standard 189 Now Open for Public Comment
 
Standard 189P, a proposed new standard that will provide minimum guidelines for green building practices, is nearly complete and has been released for public review and comment. A copy of the draft along with comment forms can be downloaded from http://www.ashrae.org/technology/page/331#849 and comments will be accepted through July 9, 2007. The standard is being developed by ASHRAE in conjunction with the IESNA and USGBC, and will be the first of its kind in the United States.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] What constitutes a floor for 90.1? - clarification
References: <MDAEMON-F200705311709.AA0912156pd80003087019@gard.com>
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200706011118.AA1839890pd80001429823@gard.com>

For what it's worth, in the User's Manual they use the term "stories" in
the text describing how to select the baseline HVAC system.  The table
in the User's Manual still uses "floors".  
 
Also the User's Manual further muddies the waters in their system
selection where they use say "Less than three floors OR less than 75,000
square feet", could sometimes contradict the standard which says three
floors or less AND less than 75,000 square feet for system 3.  The
user's manual seems to have a gap for three floor buildings less than
75,000 square feet...maybe there's an errata to clarify.
 
If I was a reviewer and you were trying to win me over (I'm not), the
percentage of conditioned floor area for the basement would be the
strongest argument for exclusion.  The economics of serving a building
through some vertical distance from the roof to your mail room probably
wouldn't keep the "normal" design from including whatever they would
have included for just a three floor building, as opposed to a full-size
basement that might require additional "System 3" units to fit on an
ever more crowded roof, plus space for duct shafts.  So practically,
your building is three floors.
 
For projects out there with full-size basements requiring multiple
"System 3" units, I'd lean towards the basement counting as a fourth
floor and requiring System 5.
 
Just some thoughts!
 
David

	My original message (below) may be misleading - the mail room is
part of a larger, seldom-occupied basement (~10% of total floor area)
that includes some parking and mechanical/electrical rooms.

	To Whomever may be able to shed some light -
	 
	I am modeling a non-res building <75,000 sqft for LEED
certification. It has 3 above-grade floors and a basement with a small
(~0.4% of total building floor area), normally-occupied mail room. The
number of floors influences the baseline HVAC system according to 90.1,
but 90.1 specifically excludes basements under its definition of a
story. Table 3.1.1A of Appendix G, which designates the baseline HVAC
system types, refers to the number of floors as one of the determinants
of the baseline HVAC system. The definition of a floor in 90.1 does not
so clearly address basements. My question is whether this should be
considered a 3- or 4-floor building? My sense is that it should be
considered 3, but I would like to get some verification if any is
available.

Chris,

I haven't used the 2-pipe changeover system so not sure what happens  
in terms of heating and cooling priority.  If you could give priority  
to cooling but make cooling unavailable through the winter months  
(just in case you have one unit overheating) then the baseboards  
would take care of the rest?

If you can't prioritise cooling over heating then you could disable  
the cooling and heating availability in the swing season and allow  
electric baseboard heating to operate (make sure FCU fan is still  
on).  In this case you would be guessing on aligning the schedules  
with weather so it probably wouldn't work that well.  You could  
iterate on different changeover dates to try and get it right ...

Regards,
Graham

Thanks to all of you who responded.  It turns out that it IS possible to use
the DD wizard to create only below grade shells.  eQUEST produced an error
message the first time I tried it, and I am not sure why.  My apologies and
I very much appreciate the responses and methods provided by those who
responded.

When modeling baseline air cooled DX cooling systems for a building, can
you combine cooling capacities to determine a single ASHRAE 90.1-2004
EER (EIR) value for the building or would you have to enter each system
separately with cooresponding EER (EIR)?

Andy,
 
It sounds like you're being limited by the extents of the wizard in
terms of your geometry.  If I'm understanding your building correctly,
you should be able to build your cellar and first floor geometry in the
detailed mode.  Then I'm assuming your 2nd -15th floors all have the
same geometry, which allows you to use a floor multiplier.
 
I would use the DD wizard to set up the geometry for your 3 different
shells and then alter them accordingly in the detailed mode.  Your 3
shells will show up at 3 different floors in the detailed mode and you
can stack them accordingly based off the coordinate inputs for each
floor.
 
If you've tried this and you're still challenged, then you may have to
build your geometry from scratch in the detailed, beginning with
developing the polygons.  I don't think you need to aggregate the zoning
in your two floors.  You should be able to create them as two separate
floors and zoning in the detailed mode.  I've managed to build some
fairly complex geometries, but it requires being able to work in the
detailed mode.
 
Jim

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] eQUEST Custom Cellar Zoning Pattern


Hello all,

I am modelling a 15 story multifamily building in eQUEST.  It has a
partially finished cellar which includes community spaces, offices,
mechanical spaces and a boiler room.  The cellar also has walls exposed
to the outdoors via "areaways" that allow light and air down to some
cellar windows and PTACs.  The cellar has an 8' ceiling.  The first
floor has a 14' ceiling with community spaces and offices.  I would like
to set up different zoning patterns and ceiling heights in the cellar
and 1st floor by creating separate shells and tracing CAD drawings, but
eQUEST will not allow "0" floors above grade, which seems to preclude
the creating of the separate cellar shell.  

I am considering aggregating the two floors to create an "average"
zoning pattern and an "average" floor height and then adjusting the
ceiling height and changing some of the underground walls to exterior
walls in detailed data edit mode.  I am also considering creating a
"cellar shell" with one floor above grade and then just deleting the
dummy 1st floor in detailed data mode.  Has anyone else dealt with this
problem in a more elegant way, or can speak to problems associated with
either of these methods? 

Thanks so much in advance!

Best,
Andy

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] eQUEST Economizer Question
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200706290835.AA3539890pd80001446466@gard.com>

Two? possibilities .
1. The office system is modeled/proposed with humidification. The increased OA when economizing dries out the mixed air. There are some keywords to close the economizer below user selected ambient humidity ratios. The best solution is to get rid of the humidifier, which should rarely be needed in a tight office building unless the office system transfers a great deal of air to the labs. If the humidity is really needed, and warm return air is available which would otherwise be relieved (the definition of economizing),? evaporative humidification works great and consumes no energy until the mixed air temp is so low preheat would be otherwise needed. BUT, DOE2 does not presently model control of the the evaporative cooling for humidification when not needed for cooling.
2. For a variety of possible reasons, the modeled SAT may be floating up from 55F (CHW loop or cooling scheduled off, inadequate capacity, etc.) during hours when enabling the economizer allows the SAT to be met. So reheat increases during those hours when the SAT is decreased back down to 55F.

Hello,
?
I am using eQUEST to model an Lab/Office building with Standard VAV w/Reheat system type throughout.? The office spaces are isolated on a single VAV system, and one option I am adding by parametric run is an OA Temp economizer strategy.? The supply air temperature set point (COOL-SET-T) is held constant at 55, and the maximum system level heating is also held to 55 degrees (HEAT-SET-T).? What I'm noticing is that there is a significant heating increase with the addition of an economizer when OA-CONTROL is the only variable.? This heating increase is outweighing any significant cooling or electricity savings resulting in an energy penalty.? I had hoped that the economizer would only mix outside air with return air to maintain the 55 degree supply air temperature from the unit.? Are there additional measures necessary to clearly define economizer control to prevent a heating increase, or is there a better way to define economizer control altogether?

You must use the PIU system type to model series or parallel fan-powered
boxes.  The ZONE:TERMINAL-TYPE keyword applies only to this system type.

Andrew,

We're trying to model fan powered VAV boxes with the System Type: VAV.
It appears if you select the system type to be PIU, these terminal unit
inputs work correctly.  

With the VAV system type, one call still select a Series or Parallel Fan
PIU, however the inputs for CFM, kW/CFM, and Zone Fan Ratio were staying
grayed.  So, unless there's default energy affiliated with the PIU
Series or Parallel selections, we couldn't find a way to input the
energy use for each box.  

Does anyone know a way around this issue trying to stick with a VAV
system type?

We have been modeling fan-powered VAV by selecting the Powered Induction
Unit (PIU) for the main system.  The DOE 2.2 Topics Manual says that
this system is an extension of the standard VAV system and allows you to
specify series (air pulled from primary and secondary air streams) or
parallel (air pulled only from secondary) boxes.  We typically will
model a Fan-powered VAV system with ECM motors and then can adjust the
box's kW/cfm to take credit for the ECM motor performance.  Hope that
helps.

According to a DOE system description I have for the PIU...

 

"The Powered Induction Unit System is identical to the VAVS except that
the PIU system uses local fans in some or all of its variable-air volume
terminal units (usually perimeter zones) to draw secondary air directly
from the return plenum." 

 

So long story short, by selecting the PIU system, you are still modeling
a VAV system, DOE has just named it differently when adding the ability
to include fan-powered boxes.  If anyone out there has contrary
information, please share, as this is a widely accepted method for
modeling fan-powered VAV systems.

Series or Parallel selections, we couldn't find a way to input the
energy use for each box.  

Does anyone know a way around this issue trying to stick with a VAV
system type?

We have been modeling fan-powered VAV by selecting the Powered Induction
Unit (PIU) for the main system.  The DOE 2.2 Topics Manual says that
this system is an extension of the standard VAV system and allows you to
specify series (air pulled from primary and secondary air streams) or
parallel (air pulled only from secondary) boxes.  We typically will
model a Fan-powered VAV system with ECM motors and then can adjust the
box's kW/cfm to take credit for the ECM motor performance.  Hope that
helps.

All:

We have a question of how to model Fan Powered VAV in eQuest. I cannot
find the answer off hand.

But I SWEAR you could do it in DOE-2.1E.

Take a look at the PIU (Powered Induction Unit) system in the help file.
You can model both parallel & series fan powered units with that. I
think it's only available in the Detailed Mode.

Steve and Jeff:  Your comments seem to be directed at heat transfer, rather
than infiltration.  I agree completely with your comments, Steve, but I
believe that the effect you describe (rock wool falling from the cavities)
would have a negligible effect on infiltration.

John:  The citation you asked for is:  Yuill, G.K. and D.P. Yuill.  1997.

It also depends on how it was installed.  I have blown rock-wool installed
in the walls of my house.  It is installed in the same manner as blown
cellulose. It has a high R-value, and its heavier mass is great for
dampening sound transmission.

However, after the sheet rock guys were done for the day, I noticed a pile
of rock wool over in a corner.  Obviously, the insulation had fallen out of
one or more wall cavities.  

I don't know if blown-in cellulose is any more stable.  In any case, if I
were to do it over again, I would have a roll of fiberglass insulation on
site so that any loss could be replaced before the wall is closed in.

Kapil,
 
There is also another method you can use to model louvered window shades
using DOE2.2.  Rather than specifying windows using the COMPOSITE keyword
you can use the LAYER-BY-LAYER keyword.  LAYER-BY-LAYER allows you to create
a custom window that includes a louvered shade on either the exterior,
interior or in-between glass layers.  This has to be done in the detailed
edit mode and has to be done individually for each window.  I suggest
creating a master window and then use the DEFINE LINK... feature to link all
of the other windows that you want to have the window shade on.  This will
make calibration and any future changes a lot easier.   
 
I suggest that you read about creating layer-by-layer windows in the user
manual first. If you are going to use LAYER-BY-LAYER eQuest is much happier
if you create all your window layers first before you change the
specification type of any window.   The DOE2.2 library has a number of
pre-defined glass, gas, blind and shades to use.  The default library
entires are limited so you will probably need to customize them to the
details of your specific project.  The big problem I found is the limited
number of glass types, as far as I know you cannot use a Window 5 glass file
to describe a glass window layer.  You can define your own glass window
layers and if you do I suggest you carefully calibrate the model just using
the glass (with out the blind layer) to make sure you are satisfied with
your results (ie: compare the results to a similar window modeled using the
COMPOSITE specification method).  
 
If you decide to use the building shades that Andrew describes be aware that
they have an outward normal that must be facing away from the surface you
want shaded.  Again read up in the user manual before using these because
you can get really strange results if they are not applied properly.  The
problem I have found with using the building shades is that they are a
screen so if you want to simulate a louvered shade you have to create an
individual shade for each and every louver over your window or wall.  This
is the tedious part that Andrew mentions.  
 
Good luck,
 
Mike

Kapil---

 

Although tedious, you can create custom building shades in eQuest in the
'Detailed Edit' mode.  With these shades, you have full control over tilt,
azimuth, length, width, location, etc.  The folder for Building Shades is
right above the shape Polygons in the Component Tree of the Building Shell
tab.  Once you create one 'set' of shades over a window, you might be able
to do a simple copy and paste in the input file and change the location
coordinates.  Good luck.

Dear John and Bryan,
I am a frequent user of Equest and because you support it I would like to
pose a question for you.

We have been trying to evaluate the effect of shading devices on a couple of
buildings and here is the difficulty with Equest:
It only allows overhangs and 2 vertical fins at the window's ends.
It does not allow you to place a number of vertical fins,which are maybe at
an angle. So we have resorted to other means to test the effect of shading
devices.

Would you have a way in Equest to get round this problem?
Thanks,
Kapil.

I, Sir, beg to differ with eQuest needing "infinite data." The list of
requirements you just stated shows me you need a great deal of input as it
is.

eQuest can read an Auto Cad .DWG layout into the tracing function (in the
Design Development Wizard). One can then trace each floor and its zones as
accurately as you can.

After having done "raw" DOE-2.1 A thru E since 1984, eQuest is a blessing,
although not perfect (we need solar water heating added).

But I am currently doing a LEED bound new museum, with 4 floors that are not
anywhere close to the same footprint, and with varying atrium highs. I
expect the entire model to be done, zones, HVAC, utility rates, etc, with 60
man hours. And I didn't trace Auto Cad files either, rather free hand traced
them.

I find it very helpful.

All:

Of course there are many software options for building performance modeling.
As an architecture studio we are concerned more w/ developing form,
assemblies, daylighting models, water use, etc... to develop good building
practice and are less interested in getting overwhelmed by all the data
required by software like eQuest. I noticed that the DOE is developing an
EnergyPlus plug-in for SketchUp which sounds promising.



What software is recommended for developing a simple but useful in-house
design tool for schematic building performance modeling? Something that
allows us to modify and evaluate the effects of building orientation, form,
fenestrations as well as insulation values, mechanical systems, lighting,
etc... Preferably something that simulates performance from a 3D model (like
SKP) not infinite fields of data inputs (like eQuest).



Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!

Regarding your elevator question, eQUEST has a set of library schedules
for elevator usage in several types of buildings (office, apartments,
etc.)  These seem reasonable and appear to be based off of the ASHRAE
schedules that are found in the 90.1-2004 User's Manual.

Going through the LEED 2.2 requirements, I see that site lighting needs
to be modeled as well. Has anyone done this in eQUEST? If so - how is it
modeled? Do you set up another lighting source with schedule? I looked
in the project & site requirements and didn't see a site lighting
option.

Also - I am assuming you model elevators in the internal loads/equipment
tab. Does anyone have experience scheduling elevator usage? What kind of
schedule do you set for them?

Lastly - the baseline requirements for Appendix G requires that there is
no self shading. Can you set that in eQUEST?

Although tedious, you can create custom building shades in eQuest in the
'Detailed Edit' mode.  With these shades, you have full control over
tilt, azimuth, length, width, location, etc.  The folder for Building
Shades is right above the shape Polygons in the Component Tree of the
Building Shell tab.  Once you create one 'set' of shades over a window,
you might be able to do a simple copy and paste in the input file and
change the location coordinates.  Good luck.

It does not allow you to place a number of vertical fins,which are maybe at an angle. So we have resorted to other means to test the effect of shading devices.

Would you have a way in Equest to get round this problem?
Thanks,
Kapil.

I, Sir, beg to differ with eQuest needing "infinite data."  The list of requirements you just stated shows me you need a great deal of input as it is.
 
eQuest can read an Auto Cad .DWG layout into the tracing function (in the Design Development Wizard). One can then trace each floor and its zones as accurately as you can.
 
After having done "raw" DOE-2.1 A thru E since 1984, eQuest is a blessing, although not perfect (we need solar water heating added).
 
But I am currently doing a LEED bound new museum, with 4 floors that are not anywhere close to the same footprint, and with varying atrium highs. I expect the entire model to be done, zones, HVAC, utility rates, etc, with 60 man hours. And I didn't trace Auto Cad files either, rather free hand traced them.
 
I find it very helpful.

All:

Of course there are many software options for building performance modeling.  As an architecture studio we are concerned more w/ developing form, assemblies, daylighting models, water use, etc... to develop good building practice and are less interested in getting overwhelmed by all the data required by software like eQuest.  I noticed that the DOE is developing an EnergyPlus plug-in for SketchUp which sounds promising.

 

What software is recommended for developing a simple but useful in-house design tool for schematic building performance modeling?  Something that allows us to modify and evaluate the effects of building orientation, form, fenestrations as well as insulation values, mechanical systems, lighting, etc...  Preferably something that simulates performance from a 3D model (like SKP) not infinite fields of data inputs (like eQuest).

 

Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] ice storage
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200706270822.AA2205671pd80001444543@gard.com>

I am trying to simulate ice storage in a building using eQUEST

I am running into problems: Can someone help me with what I might be
doing wrong?

 

1. Can I set my ice making Chiller temperature to 21F even if my loop is
at a higher temperature of 34F?

2. I have a situation when the ice storage works only during the day on
weekdays and in summer only, so how do I set up a schedule for charge/
discharge and off in the equipment control? I am being able to only
schedule for charge and discharge, using the flag sch type! (though my
chilled water loop is scheduled to be off in winter and nights)

 

Lastly, when I described my thermal storage and ran the simulation the
PS-C report showed zero load and energy use for the ice storage and I
get the following simulation messages

 

**WARNING***************************************************************
*******

             EQUIP-CTRL: control discharge                has a storage

             seqence number specified, but no storage device is

             attached.

 

**WARNING***************************************************************
*******

             In Circulation-Loop: CHW Loop 1                      the
thermal

             storage charging flow was drastically reduced because other

             coil flows took higher priority. If using 3-way coil valves

             either change to 2-way valves, or manually specify the 

             LOOP-FLOW to be large enough to handle both the 3-way coils

             and the desired charge flow.  Otherwise, tank may fail to

             charge.  First occurrence:  4/16/ 6

 

I will really appreciate any help.

 

Thank you

Robert,

DAYSIM is a daylighting simulation software that exports from sketchup
and AutoCAD/3D Studio. ( www.daysim.com )

DAYSIM is the only Radiance based daylighting simulation software I know
of that helps make daylighting design decisions based on annual climatic
conditions through metrics like Daylight Autonomy, Useful Daylight
Illuminances, Daylight Saturation Percentage and the like. I personally
find the results quite useful and It's not hard to learn at all.

No need to manipulate the models to get to 25%.  It is common for an
elementary school to not have 25%.

 

If you do not achieve the minimum of 25% all you need to do is submit a
detailed list of the equipment planned for the building to demonstrate
the actual plug load.  Be sure to include all loads including cooking,
refrigeration, computers, etc.  The last sentence in the third box at
the bottom of page 173 of the LEED v2.2 Reference Guide refers to this

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] 25% Process Load in ASHRAE baseline building

 

Hello All-

 

I am using eQUEST to model an elementary school that will be submitted
with the projects LEED documentation.  LEED NC 2.2 from October 2005
states that the proposed building "must be compared against a baseline
building that complies with Appendix G to Standard 90.1-2004 (without
amendments). The default process energy cost is 25% of the total energy
cost for the baseline building".  

 

My question:  What is the best way to incorporate a 25% process load
into the eQUEST file?  I know that I could put in a misc load into the
ASHRAE baseline building I created, and play with that number until it
reaches 25% of the total energy use, but it seems like there should be a
better way to incorporate this load. 

 

Any help is much appreciated!

 

Thanks,

Bridgette

I'm a little confused about this passage (read below)

G3.1.1.1 Purchased Heat. For systems using purchased
hot water or steam, hot water or steam costs shall be based on
actual utility rates, and on-site boilers shall not be modeled in
the baseline building design

Does this mean that if my building is using purchased steam, I can take
no credit for the efficiency provided by a central plant? As far as I
remember, for purchased chilled water, the procedure for the base
building is to model a system from table G3.1.1A & B and use the chilled
water rate for the proposed building. Is this not the same for purchased
heat?

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200706250828.AA284300pd80001443420@gard.com>

Dear All,

 

We are looking for a simplistic method to measure the magnitude of wind
pressure (positive or negative) exerted on buildings, especially of
significant height. Wind pressure can normally be calculated from wind
speed but it is an indirect type of measurement, which we don't prefer.

 

In order to measure wind pressure directly, we thought about using (i)
an appropriate load cell with a flat plate attached on its pin or (ii) a
differential pressure transducer. I talked to some local and
international manufacturers of load cells and pressure transducers but
nobody has experience in such type of measurement.

 

Any recommendations about such type of measurement (and the sensors
used) would be greatly appreciated.

 

Thanks,

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200706250433.AA3358312pd80001443321@gard.com>

Dear Robert,

 

As you started the discussion I address my contribution to you.

 

You mention the need to: "evaluate the effects of building orientation,
form, fenestrations as well as insulation values, mechanical systems,
lighting, etc." That makes me think of the very early design stages.
(Please correct me here if I am wrong!)

 

When I assume that little design information is available during the
conceptual design stage developing and evaluating integrated concepts is
particularly difficult. 

 

Too detailed design analysis tools (DDAT) are not supportive under those
circumstances as you need to make and fill in cross-disciplinary design
assumption! 

 

Those issues have been recognized before leading to the development of
conceptual design analysis tools (CDAT), which aim to limit the amount
of input detail. Examples are:

 

1. MIT Design Advisor (http://designadvisor.mit.edu/design/), as
mentioned by Leon Glicksberg before;

 

2. h.e.n.k. (http://www.vabi.nl/uploads/tx_userproducten/henk_info.pdf),
Dutch Language; and

 

3. Energy 10 (http://www.wbdg.org/tools/e10.php).

 

One capability those tools are lacking is interoperability. It is not
difficult to image that having decided for one concept, after the
evaluation of many, you would want to add detail following the design
progress. To my knowledge, the three tools mentioned above do not allow
you to export and re-use the building models with DDAT's. 

 

That is why; I personally, find the latest developments with Energy+
(http://www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/) particularly
interesting. A web based input file generator has been developed that
works with different levels of input detail, from basic to fully
parameterized. The "alternative" interface to Energy+ (E+) uses one to
many relationships for automating the input! 

 

I hope this helps!

 

Kind regards,

 

Christian

Robert,

I have been using the full IES <Virtual Environment> for a while now and 
it keeps getting better. It use to need quite a bit of background to use 
it, but recently it has included a quick 'advisor' for new users that 
requires minimum input to get started. The modeling in IES is very easy 
to learn but limited in capability as I know that there are better 3D 
modeling software out there, but it also takes slightly longer to learn 
too. For really advance modeling, IES now links through an api 
connection to the Autodesk Revit suite - it makes complex modeling much 
easier and quicker as long as you know how to use Revit.

A really nice new feature in the IES <Virtual Environment> is their new 
Sustainability Toolkit it has dynamic thermal modeling (energy, carbon 
and thermal comfort); ASHRAE/CIBSE loads calculations; solar shading 
animations; daylighting assessments with LEED daylighting reports with 
just a couple of clicks. But the best thing I like about it, is that it 
also allows me to conduct in-depth study whenever I needed it to gain a 
complete understanding of building physic that is happening to the 
building design.

Give it a try, is what I would recommend to you. I think they offer free 
trials.


Kind regards,

CK

FYI. 

There are also the PhD Theses by Sovik Bhattachara and Mingshing Liu from Texas A&M, both of these have one or more ASHRAE papers, and are based on laboratory results. Also, Joe Lstiburek has been studying this issue...and may have some reports as well. Bottom line, the "effective u-value" can vary significantly, and is influenced building pressureization/depressurization, mode (heat or cool), and exposure to incident solar radiation.

Hi all, 

Does anyone know of published measured data comparing infiltration rates with batt versus wet blown-in cellulose insulation in a stud cavity?  I have one study by David Yuill that was very informative, but I'd like to find some additional sources. 

Thanks, 
Aleka

Both eQUEST (eQ) and VisualDOE4 (VD4) are suitable for architects since they can build the building model of zones and envelope graphically.  Architects can use the default values, based on building type, for systems & plant.  IIT-Chicago recently held 2-day seminars for eQ and VD4 from May 21 thru May 24.  In my opinion VD4 is easier to learn and use (quickly, knowledgeably and correctly) compared to eQ.   eQ does a better job of building the architectural model by importing ?.dwg? files whereas VD4 has limited capabilities using ?.dxf? files but does the DOE2.1E modeling completely.  Not all of eQ?s graphical building model construction features are documented which is an obstacle for first time users.
Both programs should also offer the alternative of creating the building model (envelope and zones) with forms similar to the present versions of TRACE and HAP.  DOE2 input was designed this way.  Coordinates are required only for day-lighting and externally generated shadows.  The spreadsheets created by eQ (and TRACE) are useful for checking and revising by comparing records.  Global replace (like Excel) in eQ is not possible but it can be made in the ?.inp? file as with all DOE2 interface programs such as VD4 and EnergyPro.
eQ should allow the user to name the zones (and the surface naming system can be by eQ based on this) when creating them graphically.  The azimuth based naming system (zones should use the names on the architectural drawings) by eQ are difficult to identify and does not change when the building is rotated thru N, E, S & W.  Another limitation of eQ is that, once changes are made in the detailed edit mode, it is not possible to go back to the wizard and make architectural changes again.  
I recently tried to create an eQ model of a large DOE2.1E project file.  The numerous assumptions made by the eQ wizard are a nuisance.  I had to make changes through the forms and spreadsheets to match the numbers in DOE2.1E, and then made the mistake of going back to the wizard to make architectural changes.  Hours of effort just disappeared.  On a real project architects are always making changes during the course of the project.  The eQ default assumptions might be useful to architects who are only interested in the building model but have to complete the systems, plant and economics to see the bottom line results of energy savings.
Showing energy code compliance and energy savings for LEED are dependent on computer programs, the way computer programs are used, and on the energy engineering competence level of the people using the programs.  Besides certifying energy programs, program developers should document how to use their programs for different energy conservation options and have the procedures certified.  Building energy analysts submitting projects for code compliance and LEED should also be certified.  The DOE2.1E still appears to be the standard reference energy analysis program in North America and programs by other vendors (IESVE) might have to be checked against it.
The eQ seminar in May was sold out but VD4 had limited attendance.  I think the VD4 interface is an excellent program because of the way it is organized ? simple and obvious especially to previous DOE2.1E users.  The learning curve is short.  Would there be interest in a 3-day VD4 training seminar from Aug 13 thru 15 that emphasized LEED certification issues?  
The proposed seminar could also include 1.5 hours per day in the use of DOE2.1E directly using templates of project case studies demonstrating the energy cost savings for different combinations and operations of systems & plant for different types and formats of utility rates (ComEd, ConEd, PG&E, etc)?  The DOE2 training would include creating ?.bin? weather data from raw NCDC data, generating weather tables, charts, HDD/CDD etc., from the ?.bin? files, transferring hourly Fortran variable output data to Excel and performing additional analysis for MRT, PV, CC condensate recovery, etc.

Ecotect is one software developed specifically for architects. I'm not an expert on Ecotect, but from what I have seen its a good tool for schematic design to inform the decision making process - especially form, shading and orientation.
 
Another residential scale tool is HEED.

All:

Of course there are many software options for building performance modeling.  As an architecture studio we are concerned more w/ developing form, assemblies, daylighting models, water use, etc... to develop good building practice and are less interested in getting overwhelmed by all the data required by software like eQuest.  I noticed that the DOE is developing an EnergyPlus plug-in for SketchUp which sounds promising.

 

What software is recommended for developing a simple but useful in-house design tool for schematic building performance modeling?  Something that allows us to modify and evaluate the effects of building orientation, form, fenestrations as well as insulation values, mechanical systems, lighting, etc...  Preferably something that simulates performance from a 3D model (like SKP) not infinite fields of data inputs (like eQuest).

 

Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!

usages (not sure on that).

IES, while versatile, is not really intuitive or easy to learn.  I've
had plenty of experience learning software & drafting programs, but
IES's VE is very different from anything I've used before or since.  I
think it's getting easier with the updated help section, but sometimes
hunting for something specific was painful.  Drawing complex 3D curves
is difficult, but we have managed to get great quality pictures and fly
thrus.

Good topic.  We use energypro, equest, visualdoe to do our energy
modeling.  However, unless you have experience in this software (and
even if you have extensive experience!), input errors are likely. 

 

Have you found the IES system to be valuable and easy to learn?  I've
been hearing a lot about IES and would like to know more about its
daylight and energy modeling capabilities.

We use a program called IES Virtual Environment for much of our
modeling, especially in schematic design.  It gives us a good idea of
major concerns we might have with day-lighting, glare, and passive solar
use.  On top of that it can give some slick renderings for
presentations.  The only drawback is you need to buy the licenses for
each module to do the more in-depth things, such as ventilation air flow
modeling.  But then again you don't have to buy everything if you're not
going to use it.

All:

Of course there are many software options for building performance
modeling.  As an architecture studio we are concerned more w/ developing
form, assemblies, daylighting models, water use, etc... to develop good
building practice and are less interested in getting overwhelmed by all
the data required by software like eQuest.  I noticed that the DOE is
developing an EnergyPlus plug-in for SketchUp which sounds promising.

 

What software is recommended for developing a simple but useful in-house
design tool for schematic building performance modeling?  Something that
allows us to modify and evaluate the effects of building orientation,
form, fenestrations as well as insulation values, mechanical systems,
lighting, etc...  Preferably something that simulates performance from a
3D model (like SKP) not infinite fields of data inputs (like eQuest).

 

Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!

Thanks for posting this.  

It's too bad, as now I know we will likely not pursue EQ credit 5 or 7.
Often we have to give up one or both of those to get back better overall
building performance.  Sure there are other ways, but LEED is (or was?)
about having choices among credits to achieve accreditation, which this
decree takes away.

Ecotect is one software developed specifically for architects. I'm not
an expert on Ecotect, but from what I have seen its a good tool for
schematic design to inform the decision making process - especially
form, shading and orientation.
 
Another residential scale tool is HEED.

Kevin - Try looking at your supply air temperatures and resets. The heating
load could actually be reheat depending on how you are modeling the supply
air temperature control. A review of the SS-L for that system will give you
an idea of the amount of simultaneous heating and cooling that is occurring.

Hi All,

 

I'm running a 210 ft2 room in eQuest and have assigned generic fabric spec
and a fan coil system with baseboard heating and the location is London. One
of the facades is glazing. When looking at the demand summary the heating
demand is massive relative to all other energy demands (4 times greater than
cooling demand in Summer!). Could anyone suggest what I might be doing
wrong? I've looked at air flow rates, u-values, glazing and nothing seems to
reduce it to what may be expected.

 

Kind Regards,

 

Kevin Burke

John, 
 
I also agree, Mr. Des Rosiers should take Marlin Addison's Building Sim class (which has mostly an eQuest focus) at ASU. It is not that far from his office downtown Phoenix office.

I, Sir, beg to differ with eQuest needing "infinite data."  The list of requirements you just stated shows me you need a great deal of input as it is.
 
eQuest can read an Auto Cad .DWG layout into the tracing function (in the Design Development Wizard). One can then trace each floor and its zones as accurately as you can.
 
After having done "raw" DOE-2.1 A thru E since 1984, eQuest is a blessing, although not perfect (we need solar water heating added).
 
But I am currently doing a LEED bound new museum, with 4 floors that are not anywhere close to the same footprint, and with varying atrium highs. I expect the entire model to be done, zones, HVAC, utility rates, etc, with 60 man hours. And I didn't trace Auto Cad files either, rather free hand traced them.
 
I find it very helpful.

All:

Of course there are many software options for building performance modeling.

What software is recommended for developing a simple but useful in-house design tool for schematic building performance modeling?

We use a program called IES Virtual Environment for much of our
modeling, especially in schematic design.  It gives us a good idea of
major concerns we might have with day-lighting, glare, and passive solar
use.  On top of that it can give some slick renderings for
presentations.  The only drawback is you need to buy the licenses for
each module to do the more in-depth things, such as ventilation air flow
modeling.  But then again you don't have to buy everything if you're not
going to use it.

I'm not sure that's unreasonable - especially for a building of that
size (210 ft2) - the skin loads are pretty significant. There also seems
to be a large glazing area. Looking at weather charts for London, the
summers are really mild (highs in the upper 70s is a non existent summer
for a lot of places), so for a skin dominated building, your loads
wouldn't be that high. The winters are pretty cold though.
 
I guess it depends on how you modeled your internal heat gain (lights,
equipment, people) , outside air changes and infiltration rates. If you
are trying to model a small room in a larger building, then you might
want to make sure you have the internal walls modeled adiabatically (or
some other appropriate way). Looking at the balance point temperature
would also be a good gut check.

Hi All,

 

I'm running a 210 ft2 room in eQuest and have assigned generic fabric
spec and a fan coil system with baseboard heating and the location is

It sounds like you were modeling the chiller plant in one of the
Wizards. You'll need to switch to Detailed Data Edit (under the Mode
menu). You'll then be able to model your plant, specifying different
chiller sizes and types (you'll also get access to more chiller options
in the Detailed Data Edit Mode. When in the Detailed Data Edit Mode, you
can right-click on entry fields and select Item Help to see what the
DOE-2.2 manual says about the variable or topic (for example, the EIR or
electric input ratio is the inverse of the COP at rated or design
conditions, depending on how you set the SPECIFIED-AT variable).

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] chiller plant optimization



We are looking to model a complex chiller plant which has six chillers
of different sizes. I started to model the building in e-quest and
noticed that we can model only two sizes and types of chillers, i.e. we
can model three screw compressor chillers of 1000 tons and three
centrifugal hermetic chillers of 800 tons, but we can not model six
chillers of different sizes or types. I was wondering whether there is
any way to tweak e-quest to make this model work.

 

If it's difficult or impractical to model this in e-quest, which
building software would you recommend to achieve this? Our main goal
here is to optimize the chiller plant by running different scenarios,
different chiller sequencing, different supply temperatures,
retrofitting chillers by installing VFD's etc...

 

 

Thanks & Regards,

 

Sachin

The DOE-2.2 engine has the capability to specifically model an ice rink!
The keywords just never made it into the eQUEST interface. You need to
manually edit your input file. Search the DOE-2.2 "Dictionary" pdf for
"ice" and/or "ice-rink." Most or all of the unique keywords are in the
ZONE command. The brine chiller will probably need to be defined by
custom curves as it supplies 20F fluid. 

 

Then run the dll or exe bdl/sim versions of DOE-2.2 instead of eQuest.

 

Having said that, many of the most efficient AHUs now used to condition
these spaces are not well-represented by the systems modeled directly in
DOE2.2/eQUEST.

I am wondering if there are any programs for determining system
optimization, specifically in staging boilers.  Can one make specific
setpoints in doe-2 for determining how to sequence staged boilers for best
results?  If not can it done in e-plus?

The typical market condo in downtown Toronto has a two-pipe fan coil 
with an electric coil for heating during the change over 
season.  This is near to impossible to easily model with 
DOE2.1e.  Does equest include the capability to include electric 
backup with the TPTC hydronic system?

Some of this information you will need to obtain from the manufacturer of the blinds to be installed in the building. 

*	The shading schedule is a multiplier value that effectively reduces the shading coefficient of the window depending on the time of day
*	The maximum solar sch determines when the shade will close based on solar gain. When the solar gain reaches the value in the schedule for that hour, it will close the blind
*	The sun control probability is the likelihood of someone actually closing the blinds when the "triggers" go off. This should never be "1" unless they are automatic blinds with sensors in them. People are not in their office 100 percent of the time and different HVAC systems may cause some people to leave blinds open or close them too soon.
*	The open shade sch is the likelihood of someone opening the blinds when the triggers are reset. Some people might close a blind, turn on the light in their office, then forget to open the blind, even if the sun is on the other side of the building. This again should never be 1 unless there are sensors.
*	Conductance minimum T sch lowers the blinds if the outside air dry bulb temp is below the stated threshold value.
*	Solar Transmittance is used for daylighting, which says how much light is penetrating the blinds. This is determined by the manufacturer of the blinds in the building.

You will have to create some of your own schedules for this, but remember, you have to make a DAY schedule first, then a WEEK schedule, and then an ANNUAL schedule, all with the same name, but with DAY, WEEK, or ANNUAL before it. This helps with continuity and avoids confusion. 
 
I have used shading on a couple of buildings, and both have shown little savings. 
 
Hope this helps,

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Blind control in eQuest



Dear All,

 

I am running a very simple model in eQuest. I would like to control the blind operation based on the solar radiation levels and report its operation in the simulation results document.

 

The set up I have at the moment is defined in the detailed mode, at window level and goes as follows:

 

Shading Schedule:                     Schedule MULTIPLIER

Shading Type:                           Mov  able interior

Maximum Solar Schedule:          Schedule RADIATION                             Max Solar Control: Transmitted Total

Sun Control Probability:              1.0

 

Open shade schedule:                undefined

Conductance min-T schedule:     undefined

Solar Transmittance schedule:    undefined

 

Is this correct? I have tried using something other than Schedule MULTIPLIER in the shading schedule and it doesn't seem to work.

Do I need to define the undefined schedules. The help information is confusing when available.

 

Finally how do I report this information in the simulation results document. Any input would be greatly appreciated.

 

Kind Regards,

 

Kevin Burke

Christina,

Over the past 2-3 years, I have been using BPS, namely IES, not for code 
compliance but for actual design of demonstration buildings, such as the 
Low Energy Office and  Zero Energy Office in Malaysia. Extensive use of 
daylighting simulation were conducted to ensure that the building will 
get evenly distributed daylight for most of the daytime hours while 
energy simulation were conducted to ensure that the system in place have 
reasonable payback periods while meeting the energy target.

Kind regards,

CK

Complience with the Model National Energy Code in Canada is 
demonstrated using DOE2.1e.  The now defunct Commercial Building 
Incentive Program provided incentives of up to $60,000 for projects 
that could show a 25% reduction in energy use over the MNECB 
Reference case using whole building energy simulation with DOE2.1e.

LEED and LEED Canada both require simulation to show compliance and 
to achieve credit points based on the amount of energy cost savings 
demonstrated using DOE2.1e, DOE2.2, EnergyPlus, <others??>.

Hi Christina,

 

DOE2/eQuest is used in Australia as part of a voluntary but influential
rating system called ABGR (Australian Building Greenhouse Gas Rating).

 

IES is a National Calculation Method approved tool for complying with
England/Wales' Building Regulations concerning the conservation of fuel
and energy.

 

I believe DOE2/eQuest may be used in California also as part of
regulation compliance measures.

 

Kind Regards

 

Kevin Burke

Dear all,

 

It appears that in practice building performance simulation (BPS) is
only used for code compliance checking in the Netherlands.

 

I am curious how that is in other countries. I would be really
interested in your professional opinion and I am looking forward to an
interesting discussion on this subject.

 

Thanks in advance, Christina

Jeffrey,

I think your assumption is valid. As you have rightly mentioned that the Baseline Building envelope would reflect the existing envelope conditions (Table G3.1, Section 5, item (f)). 

Lighting, usage, schedules, occupancy for the Baseline Building are governed by Table G3.1, Sections 2, 3 and 4 which are 'Same as Proposed Design'. 

Keeping the function as a warehouse (occupancy, lighting, schedules, etc) in the baseline and comparing it with the proposed design as an office would not be a valid approach. 

Hope this answers your question.


Best regards,

  Hello All,

   

  Can someone please help with this interpretation?

   

  Table G3.1, Section 5, Building Envelope, Item (f) under Baseline Building indicates that baseline envelope conditions shall reflect the existing conditions prior to revision. The project I am modeling is an existing building that had single pane glass and CMU walls with no insulation. The internal use of the existing building was quite different from the new (we are going from a warehouse to an office). I assume, then, that the Baseline Building will reflect the existing envelope conditions but with the new conditions (i.e. lighting, space usage, schedules, occupancy, etc.) and the Proposed Building will reflect the improved building envelope (with, of course, the other energy efficiency measures designed into the renovated building).

   

  Is this a valid assumption?

   

  Many thanks,

8:00 PM (approx)    After-dinner talk:  Kelly Speakes, United Technologies Corp.
Kelly Speakes is presently sustainable strategies leader and a UTC representative to the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) Energy Efficiency in Buildings (EEB) Project. Speakes has been active for ten years in the distributed and decentralized generation markets, representing global providers of equipment and services. She is the author of several published articles in energy trade magazines such as Power Economics and Energy Central. Speakes holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from Boston University.
 
Kelly's talk will include an overview and status of the EEB project.  See the full abstract below:
 
The World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) is a coalition of 190 multi-national corporations whose shared commitment to sustainable development and practices are recognized around the world.  In 2006, the WCBSD launched the Energy Efficiency in Buildings (EEB) Project, a three year effort led by co-chairs Lafarge and United Technologies Corporation, with a vision of a world where buildings consume zero net energy. The 10 member companies of the project, many of which are Fortune 500 companies in the field of building products and services, represent the voice of business in their effort to issue and promote a comprehensive and credible action plan to achieve the vision, focusing on six key global markets:  Brazil, China, Europe, India, Japan, and US.
 
Buildings consume roughly 40% of the world's energy resources and are a significant contributor to carbon emissions. In the urgency to transform the building sector, a zero net energy building is an aggressive and necessary response to global energy and climate change issues.  These actions can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of the world's cities. In the short term, energy efficiency improvements can be achieved through a holistic approach to building design, construction and operation, driven by increased awareness and changes in behavior. In the longer term, facilitation by process and information technology, products and services that support these outcomes, financial mechanisms to prove them economically viable and balanced encouragement through policy and regulation are necessary to transform the industry. 
 
By summer 2007 this three year effort will assess the current state of the building industry and analyze the opportunities and barriers.  By May 2008, conduct scenario analysis to overcome financial and institutional barriers that inhibit zero net energy buildings. By May 2009, issue and promote a comprehensive and credible action plan, using stakeholder roadmap validation.
 
This presentation will include an overview and status of the EEB project. The project's key themes of market perceptions that shape financial mechanisms and institutional barriers, holistic technical approaches, and behaviors and awareness will be discussed.  Finally, the presentation will provide an assessment on the role of equipment and energy efficiency improvements and standards in driving down overall energy consumption in the US in various commercial and consumer product areas.

                                                          
Reservations:      To make a reservation contact Peter Ellis < peter_ellis at nrel.gov> via email by June 19, 2007, 5 PM (MDT).  Confirmation of reservations will be sent via email (if you do not receive a confirmation within two business days, please resend your reservation request).

Jeff, 
I would agree, if you are using appendix G your baseline would have to
match the mandatory and prescriptive envelope requirements.  That said,
if there was an exception buried somewhere in the text (Either section 4
or 5) that would allow the existing envelope to remain as is, then that
would be your baseline to compare.
 
What you should do is read thru and see what the envelope requirements
would be if you were just going in for a regular minimally comply with
the standard building permit and use that as your baseline, then worry
about G and any particulars therin.

Jeff,
That's a tricky one. I am assuming that as a warehouse, the building
would fall into the semi heated category. In which case switching the
functions might mean that your base building should comply with the
fully heated standard. 
 
Don't know if that's actually the case though.

Table G3.1, Section 5, Building Envelope, Item (f) under Baseline
Building indicates that baseline envelope conditions shall reflect the
existing conditions prior to revision. The project I am modeling is an
existing building that had single pane glass and CMU walls with no
insulation. The internal use of the existing building was quite
different from the new (we are going from a warehouse to an office). I
assume, then, that the Baseline Building will reflect the existing
envelope conditions but with the new conditions (i.e. lighting, space
usage, schedules, occupancy, etc.) and the Proposed Building will
reflect the improved building envelope (with, of course, the other
energy efficiency measures designed into the renovated building).

 

Is this a valid assumption?

 

Many thanks,

Jeff,
That's a tricky one. I am assuming that as a warehouse, the building
would fall into the semi heated category. In which case switching the
functions might mean that your base building should comply with the
fully heated standard. 
 
Don't know if that's actually the case though.

It also depends on your overall control sequences for when you intend to
operate the whole system.  We once audited a large government office
building where the building engineers were responding to a governor's order
to reduce energy consumption by keeping the chillers / towers, etc. off in
the morning until the outdoor temperature exceeded a certain temperature
(maybe 80 deg. F).  The resulting energy consumption for the building was
actually higher than the previous energy use.  This was because when the
chillers were turned on, they had to operate at higher lift conditions, and
were therefore operating less efficiently than they otherwise would have.
Meanwhile, the indoor temperatures of the building had been creeping up all
morning (due to outdoor air conditions, interior loads, and fan heat added
to the air stream), so the cooling demand was much higher when the chillers
were turned on than it would have been if the chillers had been turned on
earlier in the morning.  Also, the VSD fans had been operating at 100% all
morning, and continued operating at 100% after the mechanical cooling
systems had been turned on, since a higher volume of air was required to get
the building back to reasonable comfort conditions.  If the mechanical
cooling had been turned on earlier, the fan energy would have been much less
throughout the day.

There's definitely a right application of air-side economizer and night
ventilation controls to limit mechanical cooling (and these are all
modelable within energy simulation tools), but integrated control between
free cooling (air-side economizers / night ventilation w/ thermal mass) and
mechanical cooling systems tends to provide the highest levels of comfort,
and can provide the best levels of efficiency if controlled correctly.

I'm guessing if you have no operable windows and you have occupancy at that time, you will have a LOT of unhappy campers - regardless of climate type. You need fresh air to be productive.  One option could be to maintain fan power and fresh air, but set the temperature higher (in tropical climates).
 
Lighting reduction will depend on how well you design the spaces for daylight harvesting. Again - you don't want people working in the dark. 
 
Hope this helps.

Dear All,

What are the chances that reducing HVAC operating hours (i.e. starting it at 9.00am rather than 8.30am in the morning and shutting it down 30 minutes before closing hours), will affect indoor air quality and productivity in office buildings in Tropical climates.

Additionally, could lighting period be reduced during the working period and for how long within the same tropical conditions.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200706151016.AA1650468pd80001437126@gard.com>

Dear all,
 
The following recently  published papers may be of interest to  some of
you involved in fenestration and computer simulation.  The first paper
presents the development of new metrics to rate complex fenestration
products with regards to aspects of indoor environment quality, namely:
view impairment index  (which is used to evaluate the outdoor or indoor
view-privacy), luminance index (which links to discomfort glare), light
diffusion quality index (which links to luminance uniformity on work
planes).  The second paper presents the underlying theory and detailed
calculation procedures.  The procedures include models for the glazing
assembly and models for special glazing panes such as a clear substrate
with applied or laminated scattering film, composite film made up of a
number of homogeneous materials, and screen-like glazing panes such as
insect/shading screens, roller blinds, drapery sheets, honeycomb
transparent insulation and fibreglass translucent glazing.  The models
are implemented in a new version of SkyVision (not released yet).
 
 
Complex fenestration systems  are defined as any window product which
incorporates a non-clear  (scattering)  pane in the glazing assembly or
in its attachment.  Examples include: switchable glazing, translucent or
transparent insulation, solar control films doped with nano-particles,
patterned/fritted glass, and shading devices.  CFS may yield better
thermal, lighting and energy performance than regular  clear  windows,
but may have adverse effect on building's occupant satisfaction:  they
may impair the view through and increase the risk of discomfort glare.
Adding these new ratings to the exiting  energy ratings (U-value, SHGC,
VT) will help in the pre-selection of CFS prior to their installation in
buildings to avoid any detrimental effect on occupant satisfaction and
energy performance of the installed product.

That's too hard to say.  It would depend on the systems used & modeled.
Most can tell you exactly how much energy a fan is pouring out, and you
can run a few quick simulations in Carrier's HAP to figure out how much
is fan vs. chillers & pumps.  BTW, coils don't have an energy use
associated with them.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200706150024.AA2413625pd80001436881@gard.com>

what percentage of energy can be saved by running just the fan of an HVAC
equipment as against when the whole system (fan, cooling coils, chillers,
AHU) is running?

Thanks

Mike,

That is not exactly correct, 189P is including Appendix G (called
Appendix D in 189P) in their document as a normative appendix. So if
189P gets approved there will be a normative set of simulation rules for
the industry to use. It remains to be seen how 90.1 and 189 will operate
as jurisdiction begin to adopt 189. That will be a great seminar for a
future ASHRAE meeting. John Hogan was the chair of 189 and with the City
of Seattle he might have some ideas about how these two standards will
operate. 

I wrote a few weeks back suggesting that some Bldg-Sim people might want
to comment on Appendix G becoming normative. The 189P is currently under
public review with the comment period open until July 9th. The draft can
be downloaded from the ASHRAE web-site. 

Regards, 

Harvey Bryan

David,

ASHRAE has changed the process for Appendix G since it is informative
and not normative. It no longer goes out for public review, nor are
official addenda issued. It just gets changed. I am not happy about
this, and it may change after the June ASHRAE meeting in Long Beach.
Anyway, the corresponding changes to G have been incorporated, and will
be released soon in the 2007 version. I am not sure how you deal with it
in the meantime

Can someone point me to the reference where the addendum ac fan power
calculation method is incorporated to Appendix G?

I can see how this would tie into the ECB method, but there isn't
anything in the addendum document pointing to Appendix G.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] 90.1 Appendix G fan power 

 

ASHRAE 90.1 2004 Appendix G has pressure credits for filters, but not
for energy recovery devices. 

Thus, it would appear that any situation where energy recovery is
required, the as designed fan system is at a disadvantage since the
baseline fan bhp is calculated without any pressure credit, but the as
design system is sized to include the pressure drop through the energy
recovery device.  I've looked for interpretations on this, but could not
find any.  Does anyone know of a ruling on this? 

 

Thanks,

Use CO2 sensors in the spaces.  Have a maximum setting for each, with no
allowance for averaging among them.  If any single sensor hits, say,
1000 PPM, the AHU providing outside air should respond by opening the OA
damper.  This control scheme also works well for spaces with changing
occupancy, such as an entire office goes to lunch.  The control logic is
in addition to cooling demand, but works well to save energy from
conditioning the same amount of outside air all day long, every day.  

 

For reducing the lighting load, we have approached it several ways.  One
method was to provide occupancy sensors for each desk, office or area.
Corridors were always lit.  Another was to provide a sophisticated light
sensor system that could energize & dim the lights to maintain an
acceptable lighting level.  This works well for saving energy when you
need to most - hot, sunny days.  It also responds gradually to cloudy
days so that the occupants don't even notice the levels changing.  Each
of these was more expensive, and you are taking control out of the hands
of the occupants for the most part - something most people hate to give
up.

I'm guessing if you have no operable windows and you have occupancy at
that time, you will have a LOT of unhappy campers - regardless of
climate type. You need fresh air to be productive.  One option could be
to maintain fan power and fresh air, but set the temperature higher (in
tropical climates).

 

Lighting reduction will depend on how well you design the spaces for
daylight harvesting. Again - you don't want people working in the dark. 

 

Hope this helps.

Hello All,

I apologize if this question should not be addressed in this forum.

But if you have any input, it will be greatly appreciated.

 

If the project is in China, where the local electric motor runs on 50Hz
frequency, how do you comply with section 10 of the standard? Does this make
us exempted from the mandatory provisions of 10.4?

 

Thanks, I appreciate any feedback.

Does anyone know if eQUEST is a good tool for modelling a small single zone space (20m?) with an autosized plant?  We are getting high pump energy use and low space cooling energy use and would like to troubleshoot the problem.  This model is used to test the performance of the fa?ade, so we did not want to build up the entire building as of yet.

Thanks,
Irene

Thank you for your response,  Larry and Bing.
   
  Actually my question is, what is the number that I should set for the Infiltarion rate in the ASHRAE 90.1-2004 complianec base case model.
   
  The building envelope has 50% window to wall wall ratio (innore the door). So if we model the base case with 2L/s.m2 per window area, then we can set the infiltration rate as 1 L/s.m2 per exterior wall area in the base case. Is this method applicalbe?
   
  Regards,
   
  David

  It??s possible that the sources you referenced are looking at two different situations.  The ASHRAE section 5.4.3.2 addresses only fenestration and door products, whereas the eQuest defaults are probably for the entire wall.  A standard sheet-rocked walls air permeance rate is around 0.004 cfm/s.f., while the Section 5.4.3.2 rate for fenestration products is 0.4 cfm/s.f. (100 times greater.)  It would make sense that the entire wall (after average weighting these surfaces) might be around 0.04 cfm/s.f.  I don??t believe that ASHRAE 90.1 addresses the entire wall infiltration rate (just joint sealing and fenestration products.)

    Dear all,

     

    I have a question about the infiltration rate in the ASHRAE 90.1-2004. As we simulate the base case building energy use, we try to find out what is the reference infiltration rate setup up by ASHRAE 90.1-2004. However, we only find in section 5.4.3.2 (page 180) value is "2.0 L/s.m2 for other products". When we use e-QUEST to simulate the building energy use, we found that the default infiltration rate is set as 0.038 CFM/ft2 for exterior wall area, which is about 0.2 L/s.m2 per exterior wall area.

     

    Could somebody tell me what is the reference infiltration rate per square exterior wall area based on ASHRAE 90.1-2004.

     

    Thank you very much for your help in advance.

Tianzhen,
 
ASHRAE 90.1-2004 doesn't address the infiltration rate in terms of
infiltration rate per square foot of exterior wall area.  The default
value of 0.038 cfm/sf of exterior wall area in eQUEST may be derived
from the old ASHRAE Standard 1989 version.  It is always a challenge to
define the infiltration rate in the commercial buildings.  It is worthy
to read a field test report by NIST, titled as Analysis of Ventilation
Data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Building Assessment
Survey and Evaluation (BASE) Study.  Here is the link to this report:
http://fire.nist.gov/bfrlpubs/build04/PDF/b04043.pdf
 
PNNL's Technical Support Document for the Development of the Advanced
Energy Design Guides also documented the infiltration rate assumptions
for both the baseline building (900.1-1999 version) and the advanced
cases. 
http://www.pnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-160
31.pdf
http://www.pnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-162
50.pdf
 
 
Hope it helps.

Xiang,
 
If I had to guess the problem isn't a bug in eQuest but something with how
you have setup the model.  I just went and looked at a couple of old models
from buildings in SLC, UT I did earlier this year with IDEC and I didn't
have any problems with heating penalties.  I just double checked by
simulating several parametric runs just turning the IDEC on/off and my
heating energy was within 1%.  I also got the same results using both eQuest
3.61 and eQuest 3.60.

Hi Everyone,
 
We are evalulating energy savings from an IDEC system for a LEED office
building with eQUEST, and ran into a huge gas penalty. To maximize the
savings, all supply air passes through the IDEC system. Our conversations
with other modelers indicated many of them had similar problem. I was
wondering if there is a good explanation for this gas consumption increase
and whether there is a right way to simulate the IDEC if the gas penalty is
a bug. Thanks.

Chris,

I haven't used the 2-pipe changeover system so not sure what happens  
in terms of heating and cooling priority.  If you could give priority  
to cooling but make cooling unavailable through the winter months  
(just in case you have one unit overheating) then the baseboards  
would take care of the rest?

If you can't prioritise cooling over heating then you could disable  
the cooling and heating availability in the swing season and allow  
electric baseboard heating to operate (make sure FCU fan is still  
on).  In this case you would be guessing on aligning the schedules  
with weather so it probably wouldn't work that well.  You could  
iterate on different changeover dates to try and get it right ...

Regards,
Graham

Thanks to all of you who responded.  It turns out that it IS possible to use
the DD wizard to create only below grade shells.  eQUEST produced an error
message the first time I tried it, and I am not sure why.  My apologies and
I very much appreciate the responses and methods provided by those who
responded.

Andy,
 
It sounds like you're being limited by the extents of the wizard in
terms of your geometry.  If I'm understanding your building correctly,
you should be able to build your cellar and first floor geometry in the
detailed mode.  Then I'm assuming your 2nd -15th floors all have the
same geometry, which allows you to use a floor multiplier.
 
I would use the DD wizard to set up the geometry for your 3 different
shells and then alter them accordingly in the detailed mode.  Your 3
shells will show up at 3 different floors in the detailed mode and you
can stack them accordingly based off the coordinate inputs for each
floor.
 
If you've tried this and you're still challenged, then you may have to
build your geometry from scratch in the detailed, beginning with
developing the polygons.  I don't think you need to aggregate the zoning
in your two floors.  You should be able to create them as two separate
floors and zoning in the detailed mode.  I've managed to build some
fairly complex geometries, but it requires being able to work in the
detailed mode.
 
Jim

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] eQUEST Custom Cellar Zoning Pattern


Hello all,

I am modelling a 15 story multifamily building in eQUEST.  It has a
partially finished cellar which includes community spaces, offices,
mechanical spaces and a boiler room.  The cellar also has walls exposed
to the outdoors via "areaways" that allow light and air down to some
cellar windows and PTACs.  The cellar has an 8' ceiling.  The first
floor has a 14' ceiling with community spaces and offices.  I would like
to set up different zoning patterns and ceiling heights in the cellar
and 1st floor by creating separate shells and tracing CAD drawings, but
eQUEST will not allow "0" floors above grade, which seems to preclude
the creating of the separate cellar shell.  

I am considering aggregating the two floors to create an "average"
zoning pattern and an "average" floor height and then adjusting the
ceiling height and changing some of the underground walls to exterior
walls in detailed data edit mode.  I am also considering creating a
"cellar shell" with one floor above grade and then just deleting the
dummy 1st floor in detailed data mode.  Has anyone else dealt with this
problem in a more elegant way, or can speak to problems associated with
either of these methods? 

Thanks so much in advance!

Best,
Andy

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200706290835.AA3539890pd80001446466@gard.com>

Two? possibilities .
1. The office system is modeled/proposed with humidification. The increased OA when economizing dries out the mixed air. There are some keywords to close the economizer below user selected ambient humidity ratios. The best solution is to get rid of the humidifier, which should rarely be needed in a tight office building unless the office system transfers a great deal of air to the labs. If the humidity is really needed, and warm return air is available which would otherwise be relieved (the definition of economizing),? evaporative humidification works great and consumes no energy until the mixed air temp is so low preheat would be otherwise needed. BUT, DOE2 does not presently model control of the the evaporative cooling for humidification when not needed for cooling.
2. For a variety of possible reasons, the modeled SAT may be floating up from 55F (CHW loop or cooling scheduled off, inadequate capacity, etc.) during hours when enabling the economizer allows the SAT to be met. So reheat increases during those hours when the SAT is decreased back down to 55F.

Hello,

I am using eQUEST to model an Lab/Office building with Standard VAV w/Reheat system type throughout.? The office spaces are isolated on a single VAV system, and one option I am adding by parametric run is an OA Temp economizer strategy.? The supply air temperature set point (COOL-SET-T) is held constant at 55, and the maximum system level heating is also held to 55 degrees (HEAT-SET-T).? What I'm noticing is that there is a significant heating increase with the addition of an economizer when OA-CONTROL is the only variable.? This heating increase is outweighing any significant cooling or electricity savings resulting in an energy penalty.? I had hoped that the economizer would only mix outside air with return air to maintain the 55 degree supply air temperature from the unit.? Are there additional measures necessary to clearly define economizer control to prevent a heating increase, or is there a better way to define economizer control altogether?

You must use the PIU system type to model series or parallel fan-powered
boxes.  The ZONE:TERMINAL-TYPE keyword applies only to this system type.

Andrew,

We're trying to model fan powered VAV boxes with the System Type: VAV.
It appears if you select the system type to be PIU, these terminal unit
inputs work correctly.  

With the VAV system type, one call still select a Series or Parallel Fan
PIU, however the inputs for CFM, kW/CFM, and Zone Fan Ratio were staying
grayed.  So, unless there's default energy affiliated with the PIU
Series or Parallel selections, we couldn't find a way to input the
energy use for each box.  

Does anyone know a way around this issue trying to stick with a VAV
system type?

Jim

We have been modeling fan-powered VAV by selecting the Powered Induction
Unit (PIU) for the main system.  The DOE 2.2 Topics Manual says that
this system is an extension of the standard VAV system and allows you to
specify series (air pulled from primary and secondary air streams) or
parallel (air pulled only from secondary) boxes.  We typically will
model a Fan-powered VAV system with ECM motors and then can adjust the
box's kW/cfm to take credit for the ECM motor performance.  Hope that
helps.

We have a question of how to model Fan Powered VAV in eQuest. I cannot
find the answer off hand.

But I SWEAR you could do it in DOE-2.1E.

"The Powered Induction Unit System is identical to the VAVS except that
the PIU system uses local fans in some or all of its variable-air volume
terminal units (usually perimeter zones) to draw secondary air directly
from the return plenum." 

 

So long story short, by selecting the PIU system, you are still modeling
a VAV system, DOE has just named it differently when adding the ability
to include fan-powered boxes.  If anyone out there has contrary
information, please share, as this is a widely accepted method for
modeling fan-powered VAV systems.

Andrew,

 

We're trying to model fan powered VAV boxes with the System Type: VAV.

It appears if you select the system type to be PIU, these terminal unit

inputs work correctly.  

 

With the VAV system type, one call still select a Series or Parallel Fan

PIU, however the inputs for CFM, kW/CFM, and Zone Fan Ratio were staying

grayed.  So, unless there's default energy affiliated with the PIU

Series or Parallel selections, we couldn't find a way to input the

energy use for each box.  

 

Does anyone know a way around this issue trying to stick with a VAV

system type?

 

Jim

We have been modeling fan-powered VAV by selecting the Powered Induction

Unit (PIU) for the main system.  The DOE 2.2 Topics Manual says that

this system is an extension of the standard VAV system and allows you to

specify series (air pulled from primary and secondary air streams) or

parallel (air pulled only from secondary) boxes.  We typically will

model a Fan-powered VAV system with ECM motors and then can adjust the

box's kW/cfm to take credit for the ECM motor performance.  Hope that

helps.

Take a look at the PIU (Powered Induction Unit) system in the help file.
You can model both parallel & series fan powered units with that. I
think it's only available in the Detailed Mode.

Steve and Jeff:  Your comments seem to be directed at heat transfer, rather
than infiltration.  I agree completely with your comments, Steve, but I
believe that the effect you describe (rock wool falling from the cavities)
would have a negligible effect on infiltration.

John:  The citation you asked for is:  Yuill, G.K. and D.P. Yuill.  1997.

It also depends on how it was installed.  I have blown rock-wool installed
in the walls of my house.  It is installed in the same manner as blown
cellulose. It has a high R-value, and its heavier mass is great for
dampening sound transmission.

However, after the sheet rock guys were done for the day, I noticed a pile
of rock wool over in a corner.  Obviously, the insulation had fallen out of
one or more wall cavities.  

I don't know if blown-in cellulose is any more stable.  In any case, if I
were to do it over again, I would have a roll of fiberglass insulation on
site so that any loss could be replaced before the wall is closed in.

Kapil,
 
There is also another method you can use to model louvered window shades
using DOE2.2.  Rather than specifying windows using the COMPOSITE keyword
you can use the LAYER-BY-LAYER keyword.  LAYER-BY-LAYER allows you to create
a custom window that includes a louvered shade on either the exterior,
interior or in-between glass layers.  This has to be done in the detailed
edit mode and has to be done individually for each window.  I suggest
creating a master window and then use the DEFINE LINK... feature to link all
of the other windows that you want to have the window shade on.  This will
make calibration and any future changes a lot easier.   
 
I suggest that you read about creating layer-by-layer windows in the user
manual first. If you are going to use LAYER-BY-LAYER eQuest is much happier
if you create all your window layers first before you change the
specification type of any window.   The DOE2.2 library has a number of
pre-defined glass, gas, blind and shades to use.  The default library
entires are limited so you will probably need to customize them to the
details of your specific project.  The big problem I found is the limited
number of glass types, as far as I know you cannot use a Window 5 glass file
to describe a glass window layer.  You can define your own glass window
layers and if you do I suggest you carefully calibrate the model just using
the glass (with out the blind layer) to make sure you are satisfied with
your results (ie: compare the results to a similar window modeled using the
COMPOSITE specification method).  
 
If you decide to use the building shades that Andrew describes be aware that
they have an outward normal that must be facing away from the surface you
want shaded.  Again read up in the user manual before using these because
you can get really strange results if they are not applied properly.  The
problem I have found with using the building shades is that they are a
screen so if you want to simulate a louvered shade you have to create an
individual shade for each and every louver over your window or wall.  This
is the tedious part that Andrew mentions.  
 
Good luck,
 
Mike

Kapil---

 

Although tedious, you can create custom building shades in eQuest in the
'Detailed Edit' mode.  With these shades, you have full control over tilt,
azimuth, length, width, location, etc.  The folder for Building Shades is
right above the shape Polygons in the Component Tree of the Building Shell
tab.  Once you create one 'set' of shades over a window, you might be able
to do a simple copy and paste in the input file and change the location
coordinates.  Good luck.

Dear John and Bryan,
I am a frequent user of Equest and because you support it I would like to
pose a question for you.

We have been trying to evaluate the effect of shading devices on a couple of
buildings and here is the difficulty with Equest:
It only allows overhangs and 2 vertical fins at the window's ends.
It does not allow you to place a number of vertical fins,which are maybe at
an angle. So we have resorted to other means to test the effect of shading
devices.

Would you have a way in Equest to get round this problem?
Thanks,
Kapil.

I, Sir, beg to differ with eQuest needing "infinite data." The list of
requirements you just stated shows me you need a great deal of input as it
is.

eQuest can read an Auto Cad .DWG layout into the tracing function (in the
Design Development Wizard). One can then trace each floor and its zones as
accurately as you can.

After having done "raw" DOE-2.1 A thru E since 1984, eQuest is a blessing,
although not perfect (we need solar water heating added).

But I am currently doing a LEED bound new museum, with 4 floors that are not
anywhere close to the same footprint, and with varying atrium highs. I
expect the entire model to be done, zones, HVAC, utility rates, etc, with 60
man hours. And I didn't trace Auto Cad files either, rather free hand traced
them.

I find it very helpful.

All:

Of course there are many software options for building performance modeling.
As an architecture studio we are concerned more w/ developing form,
assemblies, daylighting models, water use, etc... to develop good building
practice and are less interested in getting overwhelmed by all the data
required by software like eQuest. I noticed that the DOE is developing an
EnergyPlus plug-in for SketchUp which sounds promising.



What software is recommended for developing a simple but useful in-house
design tool for schematic building performance modeling? Something that
allows us to modify and evaluate the effects of building orientation, form,
fenestrations as well as insulation values, mechanical systems, lighting,
etc... Preferably something that simulates performance from a 3D model (like
SKP) not infinite fields of data inputs (like eQuest).



Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!

Regarding your elevator question, eQUEST has a set of library schedules
for elevator usage in several types of buildings (office, apartments,
etc.)  These seem reasonable and appear to be based off of the ASHRAE
schedules that are found in the 90.1-2004 User's Manual.

Going through the LEED 2.2 requirements, I see that site lighting needs
to be modeled as well. Has anyone done this in eQUEST? If so - how is it
modeled? Do you set up another lighting source with schedule? I looked
in the project & site requirements and didn't see a site lighting
option.

Also - I am assuming you model elevators in the internal loads/equipment
tab. Does anyone have experience scheduling elevator usage? What kind of
schedule do you set for them?

Lastly - the baseline requirements for Appendix G requires that there is
no self shading. Can you set that in eQUEST?

Although tedious, you can create custom building shades in eQuest in the
'Detailed Edit' mode.  With these shades, you have full control over
tilt, azimuth, length, width, location, etc.  The folder for Building
Shades is right above the shape Polygons in the Component Tree of the
Building Shell tab.  Once you create one 'set' of shades over a window,
you might be able to do a simple copy and paste in the input file and
change the location coordinates.  Good luck.

Dear John and Bryan,
I am a frequent user of Equest and because you support it I would like
to pose a question for you.

We have been trying to evaluate the effect of shading devices on a
couple of buildings and here is the difficulty with Equest:
It only allows overhangs and 2 vertical fins at the window's ends.
It does not allow you to place a number of vertical fins,which are maybe
at an angle. So we have resorted to other means to test the effect of
shading devices.

Would you have a way in Equest to get round this problem?
Thanks,
Kapil.

I, Sir, beg to differ with eQuest needing "infinite data." The list of
requirements you just stated shows me you need a great deal of input as
it is.

eQuest can read an Auto Cad .DWG layout into the tracing function (in
the Design Development Wizard). One can then trace each floor and its
zones as accurately as you can.

After having done "raw" DOE-2.1 A thru E since 1984, eQuest is a
blessing, although not perfect (we need solar water heating added).

But I am currently doing a LEED bound new museum, with 4 floors that are
not anywhere close to the same footprint, and with varying atrium highs.
I expect the entire model to be done, zones, HVAC, utility rates, etc,
with 60 man hours. And I didn't trace Auto Cad files either, rather free
hand traced them.

I find it very helpful.

All:

Of course there are many software options for building performance
modeling. As an architecture studio we are concerned more w/ developing
form, assemblies, daylighting models, water use, etc... to develop good
building practice and are less interested in getting overwhelmed by all
the data required by software like eQuest. I noticed that the DOE is
developing an EnergyPlus plug-in for SketchUp which sounds promising.



What software is recommended for developing a simple but useful in-house
design tool for schematic building performance modeling? Something that
allows us to modify and evaluate the effects of building orientation,
form, fenestrations as well as insulation values, mechanical systems,
lighting, etc... Preferably something that simulates performance from a
3D model (like SKP) not infinite fields of data inputs (like eQuest).



Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!

Going through the LEED 2.2 requirements, I see that site lighting needs
to be modeled as well. Has anyone done this in eQUEST? If so - how is it
modeled? Do you set up another lighting source with schedule? I looked
in the project & site requirements and didn't see a site lighting
option.

Also - I am assuming you model elevators in the internal loads/equipment
tab. Does anyone have experience scheduling elevator usage? What kind of
schedule do you set for them?

Lastly - the baseline requirements for Appendix G requires that there is
no self shading. Can you set that in eQUEST?

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] ice storage
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200706270822.AA2205671pd80001444543@gard.com>

I am trying to simulate ice storage in a building using eQUEST

I am running into problems: Can someone help me with what I might be
doing wrong?

 

1. Can I set my ice making Chiller temperature to 21F even if my loop is
at a higher temperature of 34F?

2. I have a situation when the ice storage works only during the day on
weekdays and in summer only, so how do I set up a schedule for charge/
discharge and off in the equipment control? I am being able to only
schedule for charge and discharge, using the flag sch type! (though my
chilled water loop is scheduled to be off in winter and nights)

 

Lastly, when I described my thermal storage and ran the simulation the
PS-C report showed zero load and energy use for the ice storage and I
get the following simulation messages

 

**WARNING***************************************************************
*******

             EQUIP-CTRL: control discharge                has a storage

             seqence number specified, but no storage device is

             attached.

 

**WARNING***************************************************************
*******

             In Circulation-Loop: CHW Loop 1                      the
thermal

             storage charging flow was drastically reduced because other

             coil flows took higher priority. If using 3-way coil valves

             either change to 2-way valves, or manually specify the 

             LOOP-FLOW to be large enough to handle both the 3-way coils

             and the desired charge flow.  Otherwise, tank may fail to

             charge.  First occurrence:  4/16/ 6

 

I will really appreciate any help.

 

Thank you

Robert,

DAYSIM is a daylighting simulation software that exports from sketchup
and AutoCAD/3D Studio. ( www.daysim.com )

DAYSIM is the only Radiance based daylighting simulation software I know
of that helps make daylighting design decisions based on annual climatic
conditions through metrics like Daylight Autonomy, Useful Daylight
Illuminances, Daylight Saturation Percentage and the like. I personally
find the results quite useful and It's not hard to learn at all.

No need to manipulate the models to get to 25%.  It is common for an
elementary school to not have 25%.

 

If you do not achieve the minimum of 25% all you need to do is submit a
detailed list of the equipment planned for the building to demonstrate
the actual plug load.  Be sure to include all loads including cooking,
refrigeration, computers, etc.  The last sentence in the third box at

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] 25% Process Load in ASHRAE baseline building

 

Hello All-

 

I am using eQUEST to model an elementary school that will be submitted
with the projects LEED documentation.  LEED NC 2.2 from October 2005
states that the proposed building "must be compared against a baseline
building that complies with Appendix G to Standard 90.1-2004 (without
amendments). The default process energy cost is 25% of the total energy
cost for the baseline building".  

 

My question:  What is the best way to incorporate a 25% process load
into the eQUEST file?  I know that I could put in a misc load into the
ASHRAE baseline building I created, and play with that number until it
reaches 25% of the total energy use, but it seems like there should be a
better way to incorporate this load. 

 

Any help is much appreciated!

 

Thanks,

Bridgette

I'm a little confused about this passage (read below)

G3.1.1.1 Purchased Heat. For systems using purchased
hot water or steam, hot water or steam costs shall be based on
actual utility rates, and on-site boilers shall not be modeled in
the baseline building design

Does this mean that if my building is using purchased steam, I can take
no credit for the efficiency provided by a central plant? As far as I
remember, for purchased chilled water, the procedure for the base
building is to model a system from table G3.1.1A & B and use the chilled
water rate for the proposed building. Is this not the same for purchased
heat?

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] 25% Process Load in ASHRAE baseline building
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200706261029.AA2933937pd80001443925@gard.com>

Hello All-
 
I am using eQUEST to model an elementary school that will be submitted
with the projects LEED documentation.  LEED NC 2.2 from October 2005
states that the proposed building "must be compared against a baseline
building that complies with Appendix G to Standard 90.1-2004 (without
amendments). The default process energy cost is 25% of the total energy
cost for the baseline building".  
 
My question:  What is the best way to incorporate a 25% process load
into the eQUEST file?  I know that I could put in a misc load into the
ASHRAE baseline building I created, and play with that number until it
reaches 25% of the total energy use, but it seems like there should be a
better way to incorporate this load. 
 
Any help is much appreciated!
 
Thanks,
Bridgette

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Wind pressure measurements on buildings
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200706250828.AA284300pd80001443420@gard.com>

Dear All,

 

We are looking for a simplistic method to measure the magnitude of wind
pressure (positive or negative) exerted on buildings, especially of
significant height. Wind pressure can normally be calculated from wind
speed but it is an indirect type of measurement, which we don't prefer.

 

In order to measure wind pressure directly, we thought about using (i)
an appropriate load cell with a flat plate attached on its pin or (ii) a
differential pressure transducer. I talked to some local and
international manufacturers of load cells and pressure transducers but
nobody has experience in such type of measurement.

 

Any recommendations about such type of measurement (and the sensors
used) would be greatly appreciated.

 

Thanks,

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200706250433.AA3358312pd80001443321@gard.com>

Dear Robert,

 

As you started the discussion I address my contribution to you.

 

You mention the need to: "evaluate the effects of building orientation,
form, fenestrations as well as insulation values, mechanical systems,
lighting, etc." That makes me think of the very early design stages.
(Please correct me here if I am wrong!)

 

When I assume that little design information is available during the
conceptual design stage developing and evaluating integrated concepts is
particularly difficult. 

 

Too detailed design analysis tools (DDAT) are not supportive under those
circumstances as you need to make and fill in cross-disciplinary design
assumption! 

 

Those issues have been recognized before leading to the development of
conceptual design analysis tools (CDAT), which aim to limit the amount
of input detail. Examples are:

 

1. MIT Design Advisor (http://designadvisor.mit.edu/design/), as
mentioned by Leon Glicksberg before;

 

2. h.e.n.k. (http://www.vabi.nl/uploads/tx_userproducten/henk_info.pdf),
Dutch Language; and

 

3. Energy 10 (http://www.wbdg.org/tools/e10.php).

 

One capability those tools are lacking is interoperability. It is not
difficult to image that having decided for one concept, after the
evaluation of many, you would want to add detail following the design
progress. To my knowledge, the three tools mentioned above do not allow
you to export and re-use the building models with DDAT's. 

 

That is why; I personally, find the latest developments with Energy+
(http://www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/) particularly
interesting. A web based input file generator has been developed that
works with different levels of input detail, from basic to fully
parameterized. The "alternative" interface to Energy+ (E+) uses one to
many relationships for automating the input! 

 

I hope this helps!

 

Kind regards,

 

Christian

Robert,

I have been using the full IES <Virtual Environment> for a while now and 
it keeps getting better. It use to need quite a bit of background to use 
it, but recently it has included a quick 'advisor' for new users that 
requires minimum input to get started. The modeling in IES is very easy 
to learn but limited in capability as I know that there are better 3D 
modeling software out there, but it also takes slightly longer to learn 
too. For really advance modeling, IES now links through an api 
connection to the Autodesk Revit suite - it makes complex modeling much 
easier and quicker as long as you know how to use Revit.

A really nice new feature in the IES <Virtual Environment> is their new 
Sustainability Toolkit it has dynamic thermal modeling (energy, carbon 
and thermal comfort); ASHRAE/CIBSE loads calculations; solar shading 
animations; daylighting assessments with LEED daylighting reports with 
just a couple of clicks. But the best thing I like about it, is that it 
also allows me to conduct in-depth study whenever I needed it to gain a 
complete understanding of building physic that is happening to the 
building design.

Give it a try, is what I would recommend to you. I think they offer free 
trials.


Kind regards,

CK

FYI. 

There are also the PhD Theses by Sovik Bhattachara and Mingshing Liu from Texas A&M, both of these have one or more ASHRAE papers, and are based on laboratory results. Also, Joe Lstiburek has been studying this issue...and may have some reports as well. Bottom line, the "effective u-value" can vary significantly, and is influenced building pressureization/depressurization, mode (heat or cool), and exposure to incident solar radiation.

Hi all, 

Does anyone know of published measured data comparing infiltration rates with batt versus wet blown-in cellulose insulation in a stud cavity?  I have one study by David Yuill that was very informative, but I'd like to find some additional sources. 

Thanks,

Both eQUEST (eQ) and VisualDOE4 (VD4) are suitable for architects since they can build the building model of zones and envelope graphically.  Architects can use the default values, based on building type, for systems & plant.  IIT-Chicago recently held 2-day seminars for eQ and VD4 from May 21 thru May 24.  In my opinion VD4 is easier to learn and use (quickly, knowledgeably and correctly) compared to eQ.   eQ does a better job of building the architectural model by importing ?.dwg? files whereas VD4 has limited capabilities using ?.dxf? files but does the DOE2.1E modeling completely.  Not all of eQ?s graphical building model construction features are documented which is an obstacle for first time users.
Both programs should also offer the alternative of creating the building model (envelope and zones) with forms similar to the present versions of TRACE and HAP.  DOE2 input was designed this way.  Coordinates are required only for day-lighting and externally generated shadows.  The spreadsheets created by eQ (and TRACE) are useful for checking and revising by comparing records.  Global replace (like Excel) in eQ is not possible but it can be made in the ?.inp? file as with all DOE2 interface programs such as VD4 and EnergyPro.
eQ should allow the user to name the zones (and the surface naming system can be by eQ based on this) when creating them graphically.  The azimuth based naming system (zones should use the names on the architectural drawings) by eQ are difficult to identify and does not change when the building is rotated thru N, E, S & W.  Another limitation of eQ is that, once changes are made in the detailed edit mode, it is not possible to go back to the wizard and make architectural changes again.  
I recently tried to create an eQ model of a large DOE2.1E project file.  The numerous assumptions made by the eQ wizard are a nuisance.  I had to make changes through the forms and spreadsheets to match the numbers in DOE2.1E, and then made the mistake of going back to the wizard to make architectural changes.  Hours of effort just disappeared.  On a real project architects are always making changes during the course of the project.  The eQ default assumptions might be useful to architects who are only interested in the building model but have to complete the systems, plant and economics to see the bottom line results of energy savings.
Showing energy code compliance and energy savings for LEED are dependent on computer programs, the way computer programs are used, and on the energy engineering competence level of the people using the programs.  Besides certifying energy programs, program developers should document how to use their programs for different energy conservation options and have the procedures certified.  Building energy analysts submitting projects for code compliance and LEED should also be certified.  The DOE2.1E still appears to be the standard reference energy analysis program in North America and programs by other vendors (IESVE) might have to be checked against it.
The eQ seminar in May was sold out but VD4 had limited attendance.  I think the VD4 interface is an excellent program because of the way it is organized ? simple and obvious especially to previous DOE2.1E users.  The learning curve is short.  Would there be interest in a 3-day VD4 training seminar from Aug 13 thru 15 that emphasized LEED certification issues?  
The proposed seminar could also include 1.5 hours per day in the use of DOE2.1E directly using templates of project case studies demonstrating the energy cost savings for different combinations and operations of systems & plant for different types and formats of utility rates (ComEd, ConEd, PG&E, etc)?  The DOE2 training would include creating ?.bin? weather data from raw NCDC data, generating weather tables, charts, HDD/CDD etc., from the ?.bin? files, transferring hourly Fortran variable output data to Excel and performing additional analysis for MRT, PV, CC condensate recovery, etc.

Ecotect is one software developed specifically for architects. I'm not an expert on Ecotect, but from what I have seen its a good tool for schematic design to inform the decision making process - especially form, shading and orientation.

All:

Of course there are many software options for building performance modeling.  As an architecture studio we are concerned more w/ developing form, assemblies, daylighting models, water use, etc... to develop good building practice and are less interested in getting overwhelmed by all the data required by software like eQuest.  I noticed that the DOE is developing an EnergyPlus plug-in for SketchUp which sounds promising.

 

What software is recommended for developing a simple but useful in-house design tool for schematic building performance modeling?  Something that allows us to modify and evaluate the effects of building orientation, form, fenestrations as well as insulation values, mechanical systems, lighting, etc...  Preferably something that simulates performance from a 3D model (like SKP) not infinite fields of data inputs (like eQuest).

IES, while versatile, is not really intuitive or easy to learn.  I've
had plenty of experience learning software & drafting programs, but
IES's VE is very different from anything I've used before or since.  I
think it's getting easier with the updated help section, but sometimes
hunting for something specific was painful.  Drawing complex 3D curves
is difficult, but we have managed to get great quality pictures and fly
thrus.

Good topic.  We use energypro, equest, visualdoe to do our energy
modeling.  However, unless you have experience in this software (and
even if you have extensive experience!), input errors are likely. 

 

Have you found the IES system to be valuable and easy to learn?  I've
been hearing a lot about IES and would like to know more about its
daylight and energy modeling capabilities.

We use a program called IES Virtual Environment for much of our
modeling, especially in schematic design.  It gives us a good idea of
major concerns we might have with day-lighting, glare, and passive solar
use.  On top of that it can give some slick renderings for
presentations.  The only drawback is you need to buy the licenses for
each module to do the more in-depth things, such as ventilation air flow
modeling.  But then again you don't have to buy everything if you're not
going to use it.

Thanks for posting this.  

It's too bad, as now I know we will likely not pursue EQ credit 5 or 7.
Often we have to give up one or both of those to get back better overall
building performance.  Sure there are other ways, but LEED is (or was?)
about having choices among credits to achieve accreditation, which this
decree takes away.

Approved by USGBC Membership

In accordance with direction from its Board of Directors and its LEED
Steering Committee to immediately increase the LEED Green Building
Rating System's impact in reducing building energy related greenhouse
gas emissions, USGBC's membership has approved the update of all
balloted commercial LEED Green Building Rating Systems with the
following change: 

All LEED projects are required to achieve at least two (2) Optimize
Energy Performance points.  This requirement is mandatory for all LEED
projects registering after June 26, 2007.  Projects registered prior to
June 26, 2007 will not be held to this requirement; however USGBC
encourages all LEED projects to strive to achieve building energy
performance commensurate with this new requirement.  LEED for Homes and
LEED for Neighborhood Development projects are exempt from this
requirement. 

To help projects achieve this new mandate, a prescriptive path has been
developed for all LEED for New Construction, LEED for Core and Shell,
LEED for Schools and LEED for Retail projects.  When complete, this
prescriptive path will be outlined in the appropriate rating system
documents available here.
<http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=222&> 

The two mandatory points will count towards a project's LEED
certification. Project teams will be reminded of this change at time of
registration, through LEED Online, and illustrated in the rating system
and reference guide documents. 

Go here <http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=2303>  to view
the current Optimize Energy Performance credits in LEED for New
Construction, Existing Buildings, Commercial Interiors and Core & Shell,
and the changes that are required.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Energy Modeling Software Recommendations for Architects

 

All:

Of course there are many software options for building performance modeling.  As an architecture studio we are concerned more w/ developing form, assemblies, daylighting models, water use, etc... to develop good building practice and are less interested in getting overwhelmed by all the data required by software like eQuest.  I noticed that the DOE is developing an EnergyPlus plug-in for SketchUp which sounds promising.

 

What software is recommended for developing a simple but useful in-house design tool for schematic building performance modeling?  Something that allows us to modify and evaluate the effects of building orientation, form, fenestrations as well as insulation values, mechanical systems, lighting, etc...  Preferably something that simulates performance from a 3D model (like SKP) not infinite fields of data inputs (like eQuest).

 

Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!

Good topic.  We use energypro, equest, visualdoe to do our energy modeling.
However, unless you have experience in this software (and even if you have
extensive experience!), input errors are likely. 

 

Have you found the IES system to be valuable and easy to learn?  I've been
hearing a lot about IES and would like to know more about its daylight and
energy modeling capabilities.

Subject: LEED(r) Optimize Energy Performance, Mandatory Point Minimum
Approved by USGBC Membership



In accordance with direction from its Board of Directors and its LEED
Steering Committee to immediately increase the LEED Green Building
Rating System's impact in reducing building energy related greenhouse
gas emissions, USGBC's membership has approved the update of all
balloted commercial LEED Green Building Rating Systems with the
following change: 

All LEED projects are required to achieve at least two (2) Optimize
Energy Performance points.  This requirement is mandatory for all LEED
projects registering after June 26, 2007.  Projects registered prior to
June 26, 2007 will not be held to this requirement; however USGBC
encourages all LEED projects to strive to achieve building energy
performance commensurate with this new requirement.  LEED for Homes and
LEED for Neighborhood Development projects are exempt from this
requirement. 

To help projects achieve this new mandate, a prescriptive path has been
developed for all LEED for New Construction, LEED for Core and Shell,
LEED for Schools and LEED for Retail projects.  When complete, this
prescriptive path will be outlined in the appropriate rating system
documents available here.
<http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=222&> 

The two mandatory points will count towards a project's LEED
certification. Project teams will be reminded of this change at time of
registration, through LEED Online, and illustrated in the rating system
and reference guide documents. 

Go here <http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=2303>  to view
the current Optimize Energy Performance credits in LEED for New
Construction, Existing Buildings, Commercial Interiors and Core & Shell,
and the changes that are required.

Kevin - Try looking at your supply air temperatures and resets. The heating
load could actually be reheat depending on how you are modeling the supply
air temperature control. A review of the SS-L for that system will give you
an idea of the amount of simultaneous heating and cooling that is occurring.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Huge heating demand

 

Hi All,

 

I'm running a 210 ft2 room in eQuest and have assigned generic fabric spec
and a fan coil system with baseboard heating and the location is London. One
of the facades is glazing. When looking at the demand summary the heating
demand is massive relative to all other energy demands (4 times greater than
cooling demand in Summer!). Could anyone suggest what I might be doing
wrong? I've looked at air flow rates, u-values, glazing and nothing seems to
reduce it to what may be expected.

 

Kind Regards,

 

Kevin Burke

I also agree, Mr. Des Rosiers should take Marlin Addison's Building Sim class (which has mostly an eQuest focus) at ASU. It is not that far from his office downtown Phoenix office.

I, Sir, beg to differ with eQuest needing "infinite data."  The list of requirements you just stated shows me you need a great deal of input as it is.
 
eQuest can read an Auto Cad .DWG layout into the tracing function (in the Design Development Wizard). One can then trace each floor and its zones as accurately as you can.
 
After having done "raw" DOE-2.1 A thru E since 1984, eQuest is a blessing, although not perfect (we need solar water heating added).
 
But I am currently doing a LEED bound new museum, with 4 floors that are not anywhere close to the same footprint, and with varying atrium highs. I expect the entire model to be done, zones, HVAC, utility rates, etc, with 60 man hours. And I didn't trace Auto Cad files either, rather free hand traced them.
 
I find it very helpful.

I am currently modeling a hockey arena.  There will be a chilled water system installed for year round ice maintenance.  Has anyone had any experience with modeling this type of application?  Is it possible to have a chilled radiant slab?

I'm not sure that's unreasonable - especially for a building of that
size (210 ft2) - the skin loads are pretty significant. There also seems
to be a large glazing area. Looking at weather charts for London, the
summers are really mild (highs in the upper 70s is a non existent summer
for a lot of places), so for a skin dominated building, your loads
wouldn't be that high. The winters are pretty cold though.
 
I guess it depends on how you modeled your internal heat gain (lights,
equipment, people) , outside air changes and infiltration rates. If you
are trying to model a small room in a larger building, then you might
want to make sure you have the internal walls modeled adiabatically (or
some other appropriate way). Looking at the balance point temperature
would also be a good gut check.

Hi All,

 

I'm running a 210 ft2 room in eQuest and have assigned generic fabric
spec and a fan coil system with baseboard heating and the location is
London. One of the facades is glazing. When looking at the demand
summary the heating demand is massive relative to all other energy
demands (4 times greater than cooling demand in Summer!). Could anyone
suggest what I might be doing wrong? I've looked at air flow rates,
u-values, glazing and nothing seems to reduce it to what may be
expected.

 

Kind Regards,

It sounds like you were modeling the chiller plant in one of the
Wizards. You'll need to switch to Detailed Data Edit (under the Mode
menu). You'll then be able to model your plant, specifying different
chiller sizes and types (you'll also get access to more chiller options
in the Detailed Data Edit Mode. When in the Detailed Data Edit Mode, you
can right-click on entry fields and select Item Help to see what the
DOE-2.2 manual says about the variable or topic (for example, the EIR or
electric input ratio is the inverse of the COP at rated or design
conditions, depending on how you set the SPECIFIED-AT variable).

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] chiller plant optimization



We are looking to model a complex chiller plant which has six chillers
of different sizes. I started to model the building in e-quest and
noticed that we can model only two sizes and types of chillers, i.e. we
can model three screw compressor chillers of 1000 tons and three
centrifugal hermetic chillers of 800 tons, but we can not model six
chillers of different sizes or types. I was wondering whether there is
any way to tweak e-quest to make this model work.

 

If it's difficult or impractical to model this in e-quest, which
building software would you recommend to achieve this? Our main goal
here is to optimize the chiller plant by running different scenarios,
different chiller sequencing, different supply temperatures,
retrofitting chillers by installing VFD's etc...

The DOE-2.2 engine has the capability to specifically model an ice rink!
The keywords just never made it into the eQUEST interface. You need to
manually edit your input file. Search the DOE-2.2 "Dictionary" pdf for
"ice" and/or "ice-rink." Most or all of the unique keywords are in the
ZONE command. The brine chiller will probably need to be defined by
custom curves as it supplies 20F fluid. 

 

Then run the dll or exe bdl/sim versions of DOE-2.2 instead of eQuest.

 

Having said that, many of the most efficient AHUs now used to condition
these spaces are not well-represented by the systems modeled directly in
DOE2.2/eQUEST.

Some of this information you will need to obtain from the manufacturer of the blinds to be installed in the building. 

*	The shading schedule is a multiplier value that effectively reduces the shading coefficient of the window depending on the time of day
*	The maximum solar sch determines when the shade will close based on solar gain. When the solar gain reaches the value in the schedule for that hour, it will close the blind
*	The sun control probability is the likelihood of someone actually closing the blinds when the "triggers" go off. This should never be "1" unless they are automatic blinds with sensors in them. People are not in their office 100 percent of the time and different HVAC systems may cause some people to leave blinds open or close them too soon.
*	The open shade sch is the likelihood of someone opening the blinds when the triggers are reset. Some people might close a blind, turn on the light in their office, then forget to open the blind, even if the sun is on the other side of the building. This again should never be 1 unless there are sensors.
*	Conductance minimum T sch lowers the blinds if the outside air dry bulb temp is below the stated threshold value.
*	Solar Transmittance is used for daylighting, which says how much light is penetrating the blinds. This is determined by the manufacturer of the blinds in the building.

You will have to create some of your own schedules for this, but remember, you have to make a DAY schedule first, then a WEEK schedule, and then an ANNUAL schedule, all with the same name, but with DAY, WEEK, or ANNUAL before it. This helps with continuity and avoids confusion. 
 
I have used shading on a couple of buildings, and both have shown little savings. 
 
Hope this helps,

Dear All,

 

I am running a very simple model in eQuest. I would like to control the blind operation based on the solar radiation levels and report its operation in the simulation results document.

 

The set up I have at the moment is defined in the detailed mode, at window level and goes as follows:

 

Shading Schedule:                     Schedule MULTIPLIER

Shading Type:                           Mov  able interior

Maximum Solar Schedule:          Schedule RADIATION                             Max Solar Control: Transmitted Total

Sun Control Probability:              1.0

 

Open shade schedule:                undefined

Conductance min-T schedule:     undefined

Solar Transmittance schedule:    undefined

 

Is this correct? I have tried using something other than Schedule MULTIPLIER in the shading schedule and it doesn't seem to work.

Do I need to define the undefined schedules. The help information is confusing when available.

 

Finally how do I report this information in the simulation results document. Any input would be greatly appreciated.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200706201105.AA0502546pd80001440137@gard.com>

Hi all,

Does anyone know of published measured data comparing infiltration rates
with batt versus wet blown-in cellulose insulation in a stud cavity?  I have
one study by David Yuill that was very informative, but I'd like to find
some additional sources.

Thanks,
Aleka

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200706200506.AA0620328pd80001439919@gard.com>

Dear All,

 

I am running a very simple model in eQuest. I would like to control the
blind operation based on the solar radiation levels and report its
operation in the simulation results document.

 

The set up I have at the moment is defined in the detailed mode, at
window level and goes as follows:

 

Shading Schedule:                     Schedule MULTIPLIER

Shading Type:                           Movable interior

Maximum Solar Schedule:          Schedule RADIATION
Max Solar Control: Transmitted Total

Sun Control Probability:              1.0

 

Open shade schedule:                undefined

Conductance min-T schedule:     undefined

Solar Transmittance schedule:    undefined

 

Is this correct? I have tried using something other than Schedule
MULTIPLIER in the shading schedule and it doesn't seem to work.

Do I need to define the undefined schedules. The help information is
confusing when available.

 

Finally how do I report this information in the simulation results
document. Any input would be greatly appreciated.

 

Kind Regards,

 

Kevin Burke

Christina,

Over the past 2-3 years, I have been using BPS, namely IES, not for code 
compliance but for actual design of demonstration buildings, such as the 
Low Energy Office and  Zero Energy Office in Malaysia. Extensive use of 
daylighting simulation were conducted to ensure that the building will 
get evenly distributed daylight for most of the daytime hours while 
energy simulation were conducted to ensure that the system in place have 
reasonable payback periods while meeting the energy target.

Kind regards,

CK

Complience with the Model National Energy Code in Canada is 
demonstrated using DOE2.1e.  The now defunct Commercial Building 
Incentive Program provided incentives of up to $60,000 for projects 
that could show a 25% reduction in energy use over the MNECB 
Reference case using whole building energy simulation with DOE2.1e.

LEED and LEED Canada both require simulation to show compliance and 
to achieve credit points based on the amount of energy cost savings 
demonstrated using DOE2.1e, DOE2.2, EnergyPlus, <others??>.

Hi Christina,

 

DOE2/eQuest is used in Australia as part of a voluntary but influential
rating system called ABGR (Australian Building Greenhouse Gas Rating).

 

IES is a National Calculation Method approved tool for complying with
England/Wales' Building Regulations concerning the conservation of fuel
and energy.

 

I believe DOE2/eQuest may be used in California also as part of
regulation compliance measures.

 

Kind Regards

 

Kevin Burke

Dear all,

 

It appears that in practice building performance simulation (BPS) is
only used for code compliance checking in the Netherlands.

 

I am curious how that is in other countries. I would be really
interested in your professional opinion and I am looking forward to an
interesting discussion on this subject.

 

Thanks in advance, Christina

Jeffrey,

I think your assumption is valid. As you have rightly mentioned that the Baseline Building envelope would reflect the existing envelope conditions (Table G3.1, Section 5, item (f)). 

Lighting, usage, schedules, occupancy for the Baseline Building are governed by Table G3.1, Sections 2, 3 and 4 which are 'Same as Proposed Design'. 

Keeping the function as a warehouse (occupancy, lighting, schedules, etc) in the baseline and comparing it with the proposed design as an office would not be a valid approach. 

Hope this answers your question.

  Hello All,

   

  Can someone please help with this interpretation?

Kelly Speakes is presently sustainable strategies leader and a UTC representative to the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) Energy Efficiency in Buildings (EEB) Project. Speakes has been active for ten years in the distributed and decentralized generation markets, representing global providers of equipment and services. She is the author of several published articles in energy trade magazines such as Power Economics and Energy Central. Speakes holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from Boston University.
 
Kelly's talk will include an overview and status of the EEB project.  See the full abstract below:
 
The World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) is a coalition of 190 multi-national corporations whose shared commitment to sustainable development and practices are recognized around the world.  In 2006, the WCBSD launched the Energy Efficiency in Buildings (EEB) Project, a three year effort led by co-chairs Lafarge and United Technologies Corporation, with a vision of a world where buildings consume zero net energy. The 10 member companies of the project, many of which are Fortune 500 companies in the field of building products and services, represent the voice of business in their effort to issue and promote a comprehensive and credible action plan to achieve the vision, focusing on six key global markets:  Brazil, China, Europe, India, Japan, and US.
 
Buildings consume roughly 40% of the world's energy resources and are a significant contributor to carbon emissions. In the urgency to transform the building sector, a zero net energy building is an aggressive and necessary response to global energy and climate change issues.  These actions can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of the world's cities. In the short term, energy efficiency improvements can be achieved through a holistic approach to building design, construction and operation, driven by increased awareness and changes in behavior. In the longer term, facilitation by process and information technology, products and services that support these outcomes, financial mechanisms to prove them economically viable and balanced encouragement through policy and regulation are necessary to transform the industry. 
 
By summer 2007 this three year effort will assess the current state of the building industry and analyze the opportunities and barriers.  By May 2008, conduct scenario analysis to overcome financial and institutional barriers that inhibit zero net energy buildings. By May 2009, issue and promote a comprehensive and credible action plan, using stakeholder roadmap validation.
 
This presentation will include an overview and status of the EEB project. The project's key themes of market perceptions that shape financial mechanisms and institutional barriers, holistic technical approaches, and behaviors and awareness will be discussed.  Finally, the presentation will provide an assessment on the role of equipment and energy efficiency improvements and standards in driving down overall energy consumption in the US in various commercial and consumer product areas.

                                                          
Reservations:      To make a reservation contact Peter Ellis < peter_ellis at nrel.gov> via email by June 19, 2007, 5 PM (MDT).  Confirmation of reservations will be sent via email (if you do not receive a confirmation within two business days, please resend your reservation request).

Jeff, 
I would agree, if you are using appendix G your baseline would have to
match the mandatory and prescriptive envelope requirements.  That said,
if there was an exception buried somewhere in the text (Either section 4
or 5) that would allow the existing envelope to remain as is, then that
would be your baseline to compare.
 
What you should do is read thru and see what the envelope requirements
would be if you were just going in for a regular minimally comply with
the standard building permit and use that as your baseline, then worry
about G and any particulars therin.

Jeff,
That's a tricky one. I am assuming that as a warehouse, the building
would fall into the semi heated category. In which case switching the
functions might mean that your base building should comply with the
fully heated standard. 
 
Don't know if that's actually the case though.

Hello All,

 

Can someone please help with this interpretation?

 

Table G3.1, Section 5, Building Envelope, Item (f) under Baseline
Building indicates that baseline envelope conditions shall reflect the
existing conditions prior to revision. The project I am modeling is an
existing building that had single pane glass and CMU walls with no
insulation. The internal use of the existing building was quite
different from the new (we are going from a warehouse to an office). I
assume, then, that the Baseline Building will reflect the existing
envelope conditions but with the new conditions (i.e. lighting, space
usage, schedules, occupancy, etc.) and the Proposed Building will
reflect the improved building envelope (with, of course, the other
energy efficiency measures designed into the renovated building).

 

Is this a valid assumption?

It also depends on your overall control sequences for when you intend to
operate the whole system.  We once audited a large government office
building where the building engineers were responding to a governor's order
to reduce energy consumption by keeping the chillers / towers, etc. off in
the morning until the outdoor temperature exceeded a certain temperature
(maybe 80 deg. F).  The resulting energy consumption for the building was
actually higher than the previous energy use.  This was because when the
chillers were turned on, they had to operate at higher lift conditions, and
were therefore operating less efficiently than they otherwise would have.
Meanwhile, the indoor temperatures of the building had been creeping up all
morning (due to outdoor air conditions, interior loads, and fan heat added
to the air stream), so the cooling demand was much higher when the chillers
were turned on than it would have been if the chillers had been turned on
earlier in the morning.  Also, the VSD fans had been operating at 100% all
morning, and continued operating at 100% after the mechanical cooling
systems had been turned on, since a higher volume of air was required to get
the building back to reasonable comfort conditions.  If the mechanical
cooling had been turned on earlier, the fan energy would have been much less
throughout the day.

There's definitely a right application of air-side economizer and night
ventilation controls to limit mechanical cooling (and these are all
modelable within energy simulation tools), but integrated control between
free cooling (air-side economizers / night ventilation w/ thermal mass) and
mechanical cooling systems tends to provide the highest levels of comfort,
and can provide the best levels of efficiency if controlled correctly.

I'm guessing if you have no operable windows and you have occupancy at that time, you will have a LOT of unhappy campers - regardless of climate type. You need fresh air to be productive.  One option could be to maintain fan power and fresh air, but set the temperature higher (in tropical climates).
 
Lighting reduction will depend on how well you design the spaces for daylight harvesting. Again - you don't want people working in the dark. 
 
Hope this helps.

Dear All,

What are the chances that reducing HVAC operating hours (i.e. starting it at 9.00am rather than 8.30am in the morning and shutting it down 30 minutes before closing hours), will affect indoor air quality and productivity in office buildings in Tropical climates.

Additionally, could lighting period be reduced during the working period and for how long within the same tropical conditions.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200706151016.AA1650468pd80001437126@gard.com>

Dear all,
 
The following recently  published papers may be of interest to  some of
you involved in fenestration and computer simulation.  The first paper
presents the development of new metrics to rate complex fenestration
products with regards to aspects of indoor environment quality, namely:
view impairment index  (which is used to evaluate the outdoor or indoor
view-privacy), luminance index (which links to discomfort glare), light
diffusion quality index (which links to luminance uniformity on work
planes).  The second paper presents the underlying theory and detailed
calculation procedures.  The procedures include models for the glazing
assembly and models for special glazing panes such as a clear substrate
with applied or laminated scattering film, composite film made up of a
number of homogeneous materials, and screen-like glazing panes such as
insect/shading screens, roller blinds, drapery sheets, honeycomb
transparent insulation and fibreglass translucent glazing.  The models
are implemented in a new version of SkyVision (not released yet).
 
 
Complex fenestration systems  are defined as any window product which
incorporates a non-clear  (scattering)  pane in the glazing assembly or
in its attachment.  Examples include: switchable glazing, translucent or
transparent insulation, solar control films doped with nano-particles,
patterned/fritted glass, and shading devices.  CFS may yield better
thermal, lighting and energy performance than regular  clear  windows,
but may have adverse effect on building's occupant satisfaction:  they
may impair the view through and increase the risk of discomfort glare.
Adding these new ratings to the exiting  energy ratings (U-value, SHGC,
VT) will help in the pre-selection of CFS prior to their installation in
buildings to avoid any detrimental effect on occupant satisfaction and
energy performance of the installed product.

That's too hard to say.  It would depend on the systems used & modeled.
Most can tell you exactly how much energy a fan is pouring out, and you
can run a few quick simulations in Carrier's HAP to figure out how much
is fan vs. chillers & pumps.  BTW, coils don't have an energy use
associated with them.

Mike,

That is not exactly correct, 189P is including Appendix G (called
Appendix D in 189P) in their document as a normative appendix. So if
189P gets approved there will be a normative set of simulation rules for
the industry to use. It remains to be seen how 90.1 and 189 will operate
as jurisdiction begin to adopt 189. That will be a great seminar for a
future ASHRAE meeting. John Hogan was the chair of 189 and with the City
of Seattle he might have some ideas about how these two standards will
operate. 

I wrote a few weeks back suggesting that some Bldg-Sim people might want
to comment on Appendix G becoming normative. The 189P is currently under
public review with the comment period open until July 9th. The draft can
be downloaded from the ASHRAE web-site.

David,

ASHRAE has changed the process for Appendix G since it is informative
and not normative. It no longer goes out for public review, nor are
official addenda issued. It just gets changed. I am not happy about
this, and it may change after the June ASHRAE meeting in Long Beach.
Anyway, the corresponding changes to G have been incorporated, and will
be released soon in the 2007 version. I am not sure how you deal with it
in the meantime

Can someone point me to the reference where the addendum ac fan power
calculation method is incorporated to Appendix G?

I can see how this would tie into the ECB method, but there isn't
anything in the addendum document pointing to Appendix G.

ASHRAE 90.1 2004 Appendix G has pressure credits for filters, but not
for energy recovery devices. 

Thus, it would appear that any situation where energy recovery is
required, the as designed fan system is at a disadvantage since the
baseline fan bhp is calculated without any pressure credit, but the as
design system is sized to include the pressure drop through the energy
recovery device.  I've looked for interpretations on this, but could not
find any.  Does anyone know of a ruling on this?

Use CO2 sensors in the spaces.  Have a maximum setting for each, with no
allowance for averaging among them.  If any single sensor hits, say,
1000 PPM, the AHU providing outside air should respond by opening the OA
damper.  This control scheme also works well for spaces with changing
occupancy, such as an entire office goes to lunch.  The control logic is
in addition to cooling demand, but works well to save energy from
conditioning the same amount of outside air all day long, every day.  

 

For reducing the lighting load, we have approached it several ways.  One
method was to provide occupancy sensors for each desk, office or area.
Corridors were always lit.  Another was to provide a sophisticated light
sensor system that could energize & dim the lights to maintain an
acceptable lighting level.  This works well for saving energy when you
need to most - hot, sunny days.  It also responds gradually to cloudy
days so that the occupants don't even notice the levels changing.  Each
of these was more expensive, and you are taking control out of the hands
of the occupants for the most part - something most people hate to give
up.

Dear All,

What are the chances that reducing HVAC operating hours (i.e. starting
it at 9.00am rather than 8.30am in the morning and shutting it down 30
minutes before closing hours), will affect indoor air quality and

Additionally, could lighting period be reduced during the working period

Can someone point me to the reference where the addendum ac fan power calculation method is incorporated to Appendix G?

I can see how this would tie into the ECB method, but there isn?t anything in the addendum document pointing to Appendix G.

Thanks!

In Addendum ac there is an adjustment for energy recovery for the Baseline. This addendum hasn?t been adopted yet but it should be soon.

ASHRAE 90.1 2004 Appendix G has pressure credits for filters, but not for energy recovery devices. 

Thus, it would appear that any situation where energy recovery is required, the as designed fan system is at a disadvantage since the baseline fan bhp is calculated without any pressure credit, but the as design system is sized to include the pressure drop through the energy recovery device.  I?ve looked for interpretations on this, but could not find any.  Does anyone know of a ruling on this? 

 

Thanks,

Hello All,

I apologize if this question should not be addressed in this forum.

But if you have any input, it will be greatly appreciated.

 

If the project is in China, where the local electric motor runs on 50Hz
frequency, how do you comply with section 10 of the standard? Does this make
us exempted from the mandatory provisions of 10.4?

 

Thanks, I appreciate any feedback.

I'm guessing if you have no operable windows and you have occupancy at
that time, you will have a LOT of unhappy campers - regardless of
climate type. You need fresh air to be productive.  One option could be
to maintain fan power and fresh air, but set the temperature higher (in
tropical climates).
 
Lighting reduction will depend on how well you design the spaces for
daylight harvesting. Again - you don't want people working in the dark. 
 
Hope this helps.

Dear All,

What are the chances that reducing HVAC operating hours (i.e. starting
it at 9.00am rather than 8.30am in the morning and shutting it down 30
minutes before closing hours), will affect indoor air quality and
productivity in office buildings in Tropical climates.

Additionally, could lighting period be reduced during the working period
and for how long within the same tropical conditions.

Hello,

Does anyone know if eQUEST is a good tool for modelling a small single zone space (20m?) with an autosized plant?  We are getting high pump energy use and low space cooling energy use and would like to troubleshoot the problem.  This model is used to test the performance of the fa?ade, so we did not want to build up the entire building as of yet.

Thanks,

Thank you for your response,  Larry and Bing.
   
  Actually my question is, what is the number that I should set for the Infiltarion rate in the ASHRAE 90.1-2004 complianec base case model.
   
  The building envelope has 50% window to wall wall ratio (innore the door). So if we model the base case with 2L/s.m2 per window area, then we can set the infiltration rate as 1 L/s.m2 per exterior wall area in the base case. Is this method applicalbe?
   
  Regards,
   
  David

  It??s possible that the sources you referenced are looking at two different situations.  The ASHRAE section 5.4.3.2 addresses only fenestration and door products, whereas the eQuest defaults are probably for the entire wall.  A standard sheet-rocked walls air permeance rate is around 0.004 cfm/s.f., while the Section 5.4.3.2 rate for fenestration products is 0.4 cfm/s.f. (100 times greater.)  It would make sense that the entire wall (after average weighting these surfaces) might be around 0.04 cfm/s.f.  I don??t believe that ASHRAE 90.1 addresses the entire wall infiltration rate (just joint sealing and fenestration products.)

    I have a question about the infiltration rate in the ASHRAE 90.1-2004. As we simulate the base case building energy use, we try to find out what is the reference infiltration rate setup up by ASHRAE 90.1-2004.

When we use e-QUEST to simulate the building energy use, we found that the default infiltration rate is set as 0.038 CFM/ft2 for exterior wall area, which is about 0.2 L/s.m2 per exterior wall area.

     

    Could somebody tell me what is the reference infiltration rate per square exterior wall area based on ASHRAE 90.1-2004.

     

    Thank you very much for your help in advance.

Tianzhen,
 
ASHRAE 90.1-2004 doesn't address the infiltration rate in terms of
infiltration rate per square foot of exterior wall area.  The default
value of 0.038 cfm/sf of exterior wall area in eQUEST may be derived
from the old ASHRAE Standard 1989 version.  It is always a challenge to
define the infiltration rate in the commercial buildings.  It is worthy
to read a field test report by NIST, titled as Analysis of Ventilation
Data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Building Assessment
Survey and Evaluation (BASE) Study.  Here is the link to this report:
http://fire.nist.gov/bfrlpubs/build04/PDF/b04043.pdf
 
PNNL's Technical Support Document for the Development of the Advanced
Energy Design Guides also documented the infiltration rate assumptions
for both the baseline building (900.1-1999 version) and the advanced
cases.

Hope it helps.

ASHRAE 90.1 2004 Appendix G has pressure credits for filters, but not
for energy recovery devices. 
Thus, it would appear that any situation where energy recovery is
required, the as designed fan system is at a disadvantage since the
baseline fan bhp is calculated without any pressure credit, but the as
design system is sized to include the pressure drop through the energy
recovery device.  I?ve looked for interpretations on this, but could not
find any.  Does anyone know of a ruling on this?

Xiang,
 
If I had to guess the problem isn't a bug in eQuest but something with how
you have setup the model.  I just went and looked at a couple of old models
from buildings in SLC, UT I did earlier this year with IDEC and I didn't
have any problems with heating penalties.  I just double checked by
simulating several parametric runs just turning the IDEC on/off and my
heating energy was within 1%.  I also got the same results using both eQuest
3.61 and eQuest 3.60.

(IDEC)


Hi Everyone,
 
We are evalulating energy savings from an IDEC system for a LEED office
building with eQUEST, and ran into a huge gas penalty. To maximize the
savings, all supply air passes through the IDEC system. Our conversations
with other modelers indicated many of them had similar problem. I was
wondering if there is a good explanation for this gas consumption increase
and whether there is a right way to simulate the IDEC if the gas penalty is
a bug. Thanks.

Chris,

I haven't used the 2-pipe changeover system so not sure what happens  
in terms of heating and cooling priority.  If you could give priority  
to cooling but make cooling unavailable through the winter months  
(just in case you have one unit overheating) then the baseboards  
would take care of the rest?

If you can't prioritise cooling over heating then you could disable  
the cooling and heating availability in the swing season and allow  
electric baseboard heating to operate (make sure FCU fan is still  
on).  In this case you would be guessing on aligning the schedules  
with weather so it probably wouldn't work that well.  You could  
iterate on different changeover dates to try and get it right ...

Regards,
Graham

Thanks to all of you who responded.  It turns out that it IS possible to use
the DD wizard to create only below grade shells.  eQUEST produced an error
message the first time I tried it, and I am not sure why.  My apologies and
I very much appreciate the responses and methods provided by those who
responded.

Andy,
 
It sounds like you're being limited by the extents of the wizard in
terms of your geometry.  If I'm understanding your building correctly,
you should be able to build your cellar and first floor geometry in the
detailed mode.  Then I'm assuming your 2nd -15th floors all have the
same geometry, which allows you to use a floor multiplier.
 
I would use the DD wizard to set up the geometry for your 3 different
shells and then alter them accordingly in the detailed mode.  Your 3
shells will show up at 3 different floors in the detailed mode and you
can stack them accordingly based off the coordinate inputs for each
floor.
 
If you've tried this and you're still challenged, then you may have to
build your geometry from scratch in the detailed, beginning with
developing the polygons.  I don't think you need to aggregate the zoning
in your two floors.  You should be able to create them as two separate
floors and zoning in the detailed mode.  I've managed to build some
fairly complex geometries, but it requires being able to work in the
detailed mode.
 
Jim

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] eQUEST Custom Cellar Zoning Pattern


Hello all,

I am modelling a 15 story multifamily building in eQUEST.  It has a
partially finished cellar which includes community spaces, offices,
mechanical spaces and a boiler room.  The cellar also has walls exposed
to the outdoors via "areaways" that allow light and air down to some
cellar windows and PTACs.  The cellar has an 8' ceiling.  The first
floor has a 14' ceiling with community spaces and offices.  I would like
to set up different zoning patterns and ceiling heights in the cellar
and 1st floor by creating separate shells and tracing CAD drawings, but
eQUEST will not allow "0" floors above grade, which seems to preclude
the creating of the separate cellar shell.  

I am considering aggregating the two floors to create an "average"
zoning pattern and an "average" floor height and then adjusting the
ceiling height and changing some of the underground walls to exterior
walls in detailed data edit mode.  I am also considering creating a
"cellar shell" with one floor above grade and then just deleting the
dummy 1st floor in detailed data mode.  Has anyone else dealt with this
problem in a more elegant way, or can speak to problems associated with
either of these methods? 

Thanks so much in advance!

Two? possibilities .
1. The office system is modeled/proposed with humidification. The increased OA when economizing dries out the mixed air. There are some keywords to close the economizer below user selected ambient humidity ratios. The best solution is to get rid of the humidifier, which should rarely be needed in a tight office building unless the office system transfers a great deal of air to the labs. If the humidity is really needed, and warm return air is available which would otherwise be relieved (the definition of economizing),? evaporative humidification works great and consumes no energy until the mixed air temp is so low preheat would be otherwise needed. BUT, DOE2 does not presently model control of the the evaporative cooling for humidification when not needed for cooling.
2. For a variety of possible reasons, the modeled SAT may be floating up from 55F (CHW loop or cooling scheduled off, inadequate capacity, etc.) during hours when enabling the economizer allows the SAT to be met. So reheat increases during those hours when the SAT is decreased back down to 55F.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] eQUEST Economizer Question


Hello,
?
I am using eQUEST to model an Lab/Office building with Standard VAV w/Reheat system type throughout.? The office spaces are isolated on a single VAV system, and one option I am adding by parametric run is an OA Temp economizer strategy.? The supply air temperature set point (COOL-SET-T) is held constant at 55, and the maximum system level heating is also held to 55 degrees (HEAT-SET-T).? What I'm noticing is that there is a significant heating increase with the addition of an economizer when OA-CONTROL is the only variable.? This heating increase is outweighing any significant cooling or electricity savings resulting in an energy penalty.? I had hoped that the economizer would only mix outside air with return air to maintain the 55 degree supply air temperature from the unit.? Are there additional measures necessary to clearly define economizer control to prevent a heating increase, or is there a better way to define economizer control altogether?
?
Thanks,

You must use the PIU system type to model series or parallel fan-powered
boxes.  The ZONE:TERMINAL-TYPE keyword applies only to this system type.

Andrew,

We're trying to model fan powered VAV boxes with the System Type: VAV.
It appears if you select the system type to be PIU, these terminal unit
inputs work correctly.  

With the VAV system type, one call still select a Series or Parallel Fan
PIU, however the inputs for CFM, kW/CFM, and Zone Fan Ratio were staying
grayed.  So, unless there's default energy affiliated with the PIU
Series or Parallel selections, we couldn't find a way to input the
energy use for each box.  

Does anyone know a way around this issue trying to stick with a VAV
system type?

Jim

We have been modeling fan-powered VAV by selecting the Powered Induction
Unit (PIU) for the main system.  The DOE 2.2 Topics Manual says that
this system is an extension of the standard VAV system and allows you to
specify series (air pulled from primary and secondary air streams) or
parallel (air pulled only from secondary) boxes.  We typically will
model a Fan-powered VAV system with ECM motors and then can adjust the
box's kW/cfm to take credit for the ECM motor performance.  Hope that
helps.

According to a DOE system description I have for the PIU...

 

"The Powered Induction Unit System is identical to the VAVS except that
the PIU system uses local fans in some or all of its variable-air volume
terminal units (usually perimeter zones) to draw secondary air directly
from the return plenum." 

 

So long story short, by selecting the PIU system, you are still modeling
a VAV system, DOE has just named it differently when adding the ability
to include fan-powered boxes.  If anyone out there has contrary
information, please share, as this is a widely accepted method for
modeling fan-powered VAV systems.

Take a look at the PIU (Powered Induction Unit) system in the help file.
You can model both parallel & series fan powered units with that. I
think it's only available in the Detailed Mode.

All:

We have a question of how to model Fan Powered VAV in eQuest. I cannot
find the answer off hand.

But I SWEAR you could do it in DOE-2.1E.

Comments?

Steve and Jeff:  Your comments seem to be directed at heat transfer, rather
than infiltration.  I agree completely with your comments, Steve, but I
believe that the effect you describe (rock wool falling from the cavities)
would have a negligible effect on infiltration.

John:  The citation you asked for is:  Yuill, G.K. and D.P. Yuill.  1997.

of the 1997 Excellence in Building conference, Denver, CO, pages E7-1 to

It also depends on how it was installed.  I have blown rock-wool installed
in the walls of my house.  It is installed in the same manner as blown
cellulose. It has a high R-value, and its heavier mass is great for
dampening sound transmission.

However, after the sheet rock guys were done for the day, I noticed a pile
of rock wool over in a corner.  Obviously, the insulation had fallen out of
one or more wall cavities.  

I don't know if blown-in cellulose is any more stable.  In any case, if I
were to do it over again, I would have a roll of fiberglass insulation on
site so that any loss could be replaced before the wall is closed in.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Modeling custom windows with louvered sun shades

Kapil,
 
There is also another method you can use to model louvered window shades
using DOE2.2.  Rather than specifying windows using the COMPOSITE keyword
you can use the LAYER-BY-LAYER keyword.  LAYER-BY-LAYER allows you to create
a custom window that includes a louvered shade on either the exterior,
interior or in-between glass layers.  This has to be done in the detailed
edit mode and has to be done individually for each window.  I suggest
creating a master window and then use the DEFINE LINK... feature to link all
of the other windows that you want to have the window shade on.  This will
make calibration and any future changes a lot easier.   
 
I suggest that you read about creating layer-by-layer windows in the user
manual first. If you are going to use LAYER-BY-LAYER eQuest is much happier
if you create all your window layers first before you change the
specification type of any window.   The DOE2.2 library has a number of
pre-defined glass, gas, blind and shades to use.  The default library
entires are limited so you will probably need to customize them to the
details of your specific project.  The big problem I found is the limited
number of glass types, as far as I know you cannot use a Window 5 glass file
to describe a glass window layer.  You can define your own glass window
layers and if you do I suggest you carefully calibrate the model just using
the glass (with out the blind layer) to make sure you are satisfied with
your results (ie: compare the results to a similar window modeled using the
COMPOSITE specification method).  
 
If you decide to use the building shades that Andrew describes be aware that
they have an outward normal that must be facing away from the surface you
want shaded.  Again read up in the user manual before using these because
you can get really strange results if they are not applied properly.  The
problem I have found with using the building shades is that they are a
screen so if you want to simulate a louvered shade you have to create an
individual shade for each and every louver over your window or wall.  This
is the tedious part that Andrew mentions.  
 
Good luck,
 
Mike

Kapil---

 

Although tedious, you can create custom building shades in eQuest in the
'Detailed Edit' mode.  With these shades, you have full control over tilt,
azimuth, length, width, location, etc.  The folder for Building Shades is
right above the shape Polygons in the Component Tree of the Building Shell
tab.  Once you create one 'set' of shades over a window, you might be able
to do a simple copy and paste in the input file and change the location
coordinates.  Good luck.

Dear John and Bryan,
I am a frequent user of Equest and because you support it I would like to
pose a question for you.

We have been trying to evaluate the effect of shading devices on a couple of
buildings and here is the difficulty with Equest:
It only allows overhangs and 2 vertical fins at the window's ends.
It does not allow you to place a number of vertical fins,which are maybe at
an angle. So we have resorted to other means to test the effect of shading
devices.

Would you have a way in Equest to get round this problem?
Thanks,
Kapil.

I also agree, Mr. Des Rosiers should take Marlin Addison's Building Sim
class (which has mostly an eQuest focus) at ASU. It is not that far from his

I, Sir, beg to differ with eQuest needing "infinite data." The list of
requirements you just stated shows me you need a great deal of input as it
is.

eQuest can read an Auto Cad .DWG layout into the tracing function (in the
Design Development Wizard). One can then trace each floor and its zones as
accurately as you can.

After having done "raw" DOE-2.1 A thru E since 1984, eQuest is a blessing,
although not perfect (we need solar water heating added).

But I am currently doing a LEED bound new museum, with 4 floors that are not
anywhere close to the same footprint, and with varying atrium highs. I
expect the entire model to be done, zones, HVAC, utility rates, etc, with 60
man hours. And I didn't trace Auto Cad files either, rather free hand traced
them.

I find it very helpful.

All:

Of course there are many software options for building performance modeling.
As an architecture studio we are concerned more w/ developing form,
assemblies, daylighting models, water use, etc... to develop good building
practice and are less interested in getting overwhelmed by all the data
required by software like eQuest. I noticed that the DOE is developing an
EnergyPlus plug-in for SketchUp which sounds promising.



What software is recommended for developing a simple but useful in-house
design tool for schematic building performance modeling? Something that
allows us to modify and evaluate the effects of building orientation, form,
fenestrations as well as insulation values, mechanical systems, lighting,
etc... Preferably something that simulates performance from a 3D model (like
SKP) not infinite fields of data inputs (like eQuest).



Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!

Regarding your elevator question, eQUEST has a set of library schedules
for elevator usage in several types of buildings (office, apartments,
etc.)  These seem reasonable and appear to be based off of the ASHRAE
schedules that are found in the 90.1-2004 User's Manual.

Going through the LEED 2.2 requirements, I see that site lighting needs
to be modeled as well. Has anyone done this in eQUEST? If so - how is it
modeled? Do you set up another lighting source with schedule? I looked
in the project & site requirements and didn't see a site lighting
option.

Also - I am assuming you model elevators in the internal loads/equipment
tab. Does anyone have experience scheduling elevator usage? What kind of
schedule do you set for them?

Lastly - the baseline requirements for Appendix G requires that there is

Although tedious, you can create custom building shades in eQuest in the
'Detailed Edit' mode.  With these shades, you have full control over
tilt, azimuth, length, width, location, etc.  The folder for Building
Shades is right above the shape Polygons in the Component Tree of the
Building Shell tab.  Once you create one 'set' of shades over a window,
you might be able to do a simple copy and paste in the input file and
change the location coordinates.  Good luck.

Dear John and Bryan,
I am a frequent user of Equest and because you support it I would like
to pose a question for you.

We have been trying to evaluate the effect of shading devices on a
couple of buildings and here is the difficulty with Equest:
It only allows overhangs and 2 vertical fins at the window's ends.
It does not allow you to place a number of vertical fins,which are maybe
at an angle. So we have resorted to other means to test the effect of
shading devices.

Would you have a way in Equest to get round this problem?
Thanks,
Kapil.

I, Sir, beg to differ with eQuest needing "infinite data." The list of
requirements you just stated shows me you need a great deal of input as
it is.

eQuest can read an Auto Cad .DWG layout into the tracing function (in
the Design Development Wizard). One can then trace each floor and its
zones as accurately as you can.

After having done "raw" DOE-2.1 A thru E since 1984, eQuest is a
blessing, although not perfect (we need solar water heating added).

But I am currently doing a LEED bound new museum, with 4 floors that are
not anywhere close to the same footprint, and with varying atrium highs.
I expect the entire model to be done, zones, HVAC, utility rates, etc,
with 60 man hours. And I didn't trace Auto Cad files either, rather free
hand traced them.

I find it very helpful.

All:

Of course there are many software options for building performance
modeling. As an architecture studio we are concerned more w/ developing
form, assemblies, daylighting models, water use, etc... to develop good
building practice and are less interested in getting overwhelmed by all
the data required by software like eQuest. I noticed that the DOE is
developing an EnergyPlus plug-in for SketchUp which sounds promising.



What software is recommended for developing a simple but useful in-house
design tool for schematic building performance modeling? Something that
allows us to modify and evaluate the effects of building orientation,
form, fenestrations as well as insulation values, mechanical systems,
lighting, etc... Preferably something that simulates performance from a
3D model (like SKP) not infinite fields of data inputs (like eQuest).



Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] ice storage
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200706270822.AA2205671pd80001444543@gard.com>

I am trying to simulate ice storage in a building using eQUEST

I am running into problems: Can someone help me with what I might be
doing wrong?

 

1. Can I set my ice making Chiller temperature to 21F even if my loop is
at a higher temperature of 34F?

2. I have a situation when the ice storage works only during the day on
weekdays and in summer only, so how do I set up a schedule for charge/
discharge and off in the equipment control? I am being able to only
schedule for charge and discharge, using the flag sch type! (though my
chilled water loop is scheduled to be off in winter and nights)

 

Lastly, when I described my thermal storage and ran the simulation the
PS-C report showed zero load and energy use for the ice storage and I
get the following simulation messages

 

**WARNING***************************************************************
*******

             EQUIP-CTRL: control discharge                has a storage

             seqence number specified, but no storage device is

             attached.

 

**WARNING***************************************************************
*******

             In Circulation-Loop: CHW Loop 1                      the
thermal

             storage charging flow was drastically reduced because other

             coil flows took higher priority. If using 3-way coil valves

             either change to 2-way valves, or manually specify the 

             LOOP-FLOW to be large enough to handle both the 3-way coils

             and the desired charge flow.  Otherwise, tank may fail to

             charge.  First occurrence:  4/16/ 6

 

I will really appreciate any help.

 

Thank you

Alpana

DAYSIM is the only Radiance based daylighting simulation software I know
of that helps make daylighting design decisions based on annual climatic
conditions through metrics like Daylight Autonomy, Useful Daylight
Illuminances, Daylight Saturation Percentage and the like. I personally
find the results quite useful and It's not hard to learn at all.

No need to manipulate the models to get to 25%.  It is common for an
elementary school to not have 25%.

 

If you do not achieve the minimum of 25% all you need to do is submit a
detailed list of the equipment planned for the building to demonstrate
the actual plug load.  Be sure to include all loads including cooking,
refrigeration, computers, etc.  The last sentence in the third box at
the bottom of page 173 of the LEED v2.2 Reference Guide refers to this
supporting documentation.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] 25% Process Load in ASHRAE baseline building

 

Hello All-

 

I am using eQUEST to model an elementary school that will be submitted
with the projects LEED documentation.  LEED NC 2.2 from October 2005
states that the proposed building "must be compared against a baseline
building that complies with Appendix G to Standard 90.1-2004 (without
amendments). The default process energy cost is 25% of the total energy
cost for the baseline building".  

 

My question:  What is the best way to incorporate a 25% process load
into the eQUEST file?  I know that I could put in a misc load into the
ASHRAE baseline building I created, and play with that number until it
reaches 25% of the total energy use, but it seems like there should be a
better way to incorporate this load. 

 

Any help is much appreciated!

 

Thanks,

Bridgette

I'm a little confused about this passage (read below)

G3.1.1.1 Purchased Heat. For systems using purchased
hot water or steam, hot water or steam costs shall be based on
actual utility rates, and on-site boilers shall not be modeled in
the baseline building design

Does this mean that if my building is using purchased steam, I can take
no credit for the efficiency provided by a central plant? As far as I
remember, for purchased chilled water, the procedure for the base
building is to model a system from table G3.1.1A & B and use the chilled
water rate for the proposed building. Is this not the same for purchased
heat?

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200706250828.AA284300pd80001443420@gard.com>

Dear All,

 

We are looking for a simplistic method to measure the magnitude of wind
pressure (positive or negative) exerted on buildings, especially of
significant height. Wind pressure can normally be calculated from wind
speed but it is an indirect type of measurement, which we don't prefer.

 

In order to measure wind pressure directly, we thought about using (i)
an appropriate load cell with a flat plate attached on its pin or (ii) a
differential pressure transducer. I talked to some local and
international manufacturers of load cells and pressure transducers but
nobody has experience in such type of measurement.

 

Any recommendations about such type of measurement (and the sensors
used) would be greatly appreciated.

 

Thanks,

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200706250433.AA3358312pd80001443321@gard.com>

Dear Robert,

 

As you started the discussion I address my contribution to you.

 

You mention the need to: "evaluate the effects of building orientation,
form, fenestrations as well as insulation values, mechanical systems,
lighting, etc." That makes me think of the very early design stages.
(Please correct me here if I am wrong!)

 

When I assume that little design information is available during the
conceptual design stage developing and evaluating integrated concepts is
particularly difficult. 

 

Too detailed design analysis tools (DDAT) are not supportive under those
circumstances as you need to make and fill in cross-disciplinary design
assumption! 

 

Those issues have been recognized before leading to the development of
conceptual design analysis tools (CDAT), which aim to limit the amount
of input detail. Examples are:

 

1. MIT Design Advisor (http://designadvisor.mit.edu/design/), as
mentioned by Leon Glicksberg before;

 

2. h.e.n.k. (http://www.vabi.nl/uploads/tx_userproducten/henk_info.pdf),
Dutch Language; and

 

3. Energy 10 (http://www.wbdg.org/tools/e10.php).

 

One capability those tools are lacking is interoperability. It is not
difficult to image that having decided for one concept, after the
evaluation of many, you would want to add detail following the design
progress. To my knowledge, the three tools mentioned above do not allow
you to export and re-use the building models with DDAT's. 

 

That is why; I personally, find the latest developments with Energy+
(http://www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/) particularly
interesting. A web based input file generator has been developed that
works with different levels of input detail, from basic to fully
parameterized. The "alternative" interface to Energy+ (E+) uses one to
many relationships for automating the input! 

 

I hope this helps!

 

Kind regards,

 

Christian

Robert,

I have been using the full IES <Virtual Environment> for a while now and 
it keeps getting better. It use to need quite a bit of background to use 
it, but recently it has included a quick 'advisor' for new users that 
requires minimum input to get started. The modeling in IES is very easy 
to learn but limited in capability as I know that there are better 3D 
modeling software out there, but it also takes slightly longer to learn 
too. For really advance modeling, IES now links through an api 
connection to the Autodesk Revit suite - it makes complex modeling much 
easier and quicker as long as you know how to use Revit.

A really nice new feature in the IES <Virtual Environment> is their new 
Sustainability Toolkit it has dynamic thermal modeling (energy, carbon 
and thermal comfort); ASHRAE/CIBSE loads calculations; solar shading 
animations; daylighting assessments with LEED daylighting reports with 
just a couple of clicks. But the best thing I like about it, is that it 
also allows me to conduct in-depth study whenever I needed it to gain a 
complete understanding of building physic that is happening to the 
building design.

Give it a try, is what I would recommend to you. I think they offer free 
trials.


Kind regards,

CK

FYI. 

There are also the PhD Theses by Sovik Bhattachara and Mingshing Liu from Texas A&M, both of these have one or more ASHRAE papers, and are based on laboratory results. Also, Joe Lstiburek has been studying this issue...and may have some reports as well. Bottom line, the "effective u-value" can vary significantly, and is influenced building pressureization/depressurization, mode (heat or cool), and exposure to incident solar radiation.

Both eQUEST (eQ) and VisualDOE4 (VD4) are suitable for architects since they can build the building model of zones and envelope graphically.  Architects can use the default values, based on building type, for systems & plant.  IIT-Chicago recently held 2-day seminars for eQ and VD4 from May 21 thru May 24.  In my opinion VD4 is easier to learn and use (quickly, knowledgeably and correctly) compared to eQ.   eQ does a better job of building the architectural model by importing ?.dwg? files whereas VD4 has limited capabilities using ?.dxf? files but does the DOE2.1E modeling completely.  Not all of eQ?s graphical building model construction features are documented which is an obstacle for first time users.
Both programs should also offer the alternative of creating the building model (envelope and zones) with forms similar to the present versions of TRACE and HAP.  DOE2 input was designed this way.  Coordinates are required only for day-lighting and externally generated shadows.  The spreadsheets created by eQ (and TRACE) are useful for checking and revising by comparing records.  Global replace (like Excel) in eQ is not possible but it can be made in the ?.inp? file as with all DOE2 interface programs such as VD4 and EnergyPro.
eQ should allow the user to name the zones (and the surface naming system can be by eQ based on this) when creating them graphically.  The azimuth based naming system (zones should use the names on the architectural drawings) by eQ are difficult to identify and does not change when the building is rotated thru N, E, S & W.  Another limitation of eQ is that, once changes are made in the detailed edit mode, it is not possible to go back to the wizard and make architectural changes again.  
I recently tried to create an eQ model of a large DOE2.1E project file.  The numerous assumptions made by the eQ wizard are a nuisance.  I had to make changes through the forms and spreadsheets to match the numbers in DOE2.1E, and then made the mistake of going back to the wizard to make architectural changes.  Hours of effort just disappeared.  On a real project architects are always making changes during the course of the project.  The eQ default assumptions might be useful to architects who are only interested in the building model but have to complete the systems, plant and economics to see the bottom line results of energy savings.
Showing energy code compliance and energy savings for LEED are dependent on computer programs, the way computer programs are used, and on the energy engineering competence level of the people using the programs.  Besides certifying energy programs, program developers should document how to use their programs for different energy conservation options and have the procedures certified.  Building energy analysts submitting projects for code compliance and LEED should also be certified.  The DOE2.1E still appears to be the standard reference energy analysis program in North America and programs by other vendors (IESVE) might have to be checked against it.
The eQ seminar in May was sold out but VD4 had limited attendance.  I think the VD4 interface is an excellent program because of the way it is organized ? simple and obvious especially to previous DOE2.1E users.  The learning curve is short.  Would there be interest in a 3-day VD4 training seminar from Aug 13 thru 15 that emphasized LEED certification issues?  
The proposed seminar could also include 1.5 hours per day in the use of DOE2.1E directly using templates of project case studies demonstrating the energy cost savings for different combinations and operations of systems & plant for different types and formats of utility rates (ComEd, ConEd, PG&E, etc)?  The DOE2 training would include creating ?.bin? weather data from raw NCDC data, generating weather tables, charts, HDD/CDD etc., from the ?.bin? files, transferring hourly Fortran variable output data to Excel and performing additional analysis for MRT, PV, CC condensate recovery, etc.

Ecotect is one software developed specifically for architects. I'm not an expert on Ecotect, but from what I have seen its a good tool for schematic design to inform the decision making process - especially form, shading and orientation.
 
Another residential scale tool is HEED.

IES, while versatile, is not really intuitive or easy to learn.  I've
had plenty of experience learning software & drafting programs, but
IES's VE is very different from anything I've used before or since.  I
think it's getting easier with the updated help section, but sometimes
hunting for something specific was painful.  Drawing complex 3D curves
is difficult, but we have managed to get great quality pictures and fly
thrus.

Good topic.  We use energypro, equest, visualdoe to do our energy
modeling.  However, unless you have experience in this software (and
even if you have extensive experience!), input errors are likely. 

 

Have you found the IES system to be valuable and easy to learn?  I've
been hearing a lot about IES and would like to know more about its
daylight and energy modeling capabilities.

We use a program called IES Virtual Environment for much of our
modeling, especially in schematic design.  It gives us a good idea of
major concerns we might have with day-lighting, glare, and passive solar
use.  On top of that it can give some slick renderings for
presentations.  The only drawback is you need to buy the licenses for
each module to do the more in-depth things, such as ventilation air flow
modeling.  But then again you don't have to buy everything if you're not
going to use it.

All:

Of course there are many software options for building performance
modeling.  As an architecture studio we are concerned more w/ developing
form, assemblies, daylighting models, water use, etc... to develop good
building practice and are less interested in getting overwhelmed by all
the data required by software like eQuest.  I noticed that the DOE is
developing an EnergyPlus plug-in for SketchUp which sounds promising.

 

What software is recommended for developing a simple but useful in-house
design tool for schematic building performance modeling?  Something that
allows us to modify and evaluate the effects of building orientation,
form, fenestrations as well as insulation values, mechanical systems,
lighting, etc...  Preferably something that simulates performance from a
3D model (like SKP) not infinite fields of data inputs (like eQuest).

 

Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!

Thanks for posting this.  

It's too bad, as now I know we will likely not pursue EQ credit 5 or 7.
Often we have to give up one or both of those to get back better overall
building performance.  Sure there are other ways, but LEED is (or was?)
about having choices among credits to achieve accreditation, which this
decree takes away.

Approved by USGBC Membership

In accordance with direction from its Board of Directors and its LEED
Steering Committee to immediately increase the LEED Green Building
Rating System's impact in reducing building energy related greenhouse
gas emissions, USGBC's membership has approved the update of all
balloted commercial LEED Green Building Rating Systems with the
following change: 

All LEED projects are required to achieve at least two (2) Optimize
Energy Performance points.  This requirement is mandatory for all LEED
projects registering after June 26, 2007.  Projects registered prior to
June 26, 2007 will not be held to this requirement; however USGBC
encourages all LEED projects to strive to achieve building energy
performance commensurate with this new requirement.  LEED for Homes and
LEED for Neighborhood Development projects are exempt from this
requirement. 

To help projects achieve this new mandate, a prescriptive path has been
developed for all LEED for New Construction, LEED for Core and Shell,
LEED for Schools and LEED for Retail projects.  When complete, this
prescriptive path will be outlined in the appropriate rating system
documents available here.
<http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=222&> 

The two mandatory points will count towards a project's LEED
certification. Project teams will be reminded of this change at time of
registration, through LEED Online, and illustrated in the rating system
and reference guide documents. 

Go here <http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=2303>  to view
the current Optimize Energy Performance credits in LEED for New
Construction, Existing Buildings, Commercial Interiors and Core & Shell,
and the changes that are required.

Ecotect is one software developed specifically for architects. I'm not
an expert on Ecotect, but from what I have seen its a good tool for
schematic design to inform the decision making process - especially
form, shading and orientation.
 
Another residential scale tool is HEED.

All:

Of course there are many software options for building performance
modeling.  As an architecture studio we are concerned more w/ developing
form, assemblies, daylighting models, water use, etc... to develop good
building practice and are less interested in getting overwhelmed by all
the data required by software like eQuest.  I noticed that the DOE is
developing an EnergyPlus plug-in for SketchUp which sounds promising.

 

What software is recommended for developing a simple but useful in-house
design tool for schematic building performance modeling?  Something that
allows us to modify and evaluate the effects of building orientation,
form, fenestrations as well as insulation values, mechanical systems,
lighting, etc...  Preferably something that simulates performance from a
3D model (like SKP) not infinite fields of data inputs (like eQuest).

 

Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!

We use a program called IES Virtual Environment for much of our modeling, especially in schematic design.  It gives us a good idea of major concerns we might have with day-lighting, glare, and passive solar use.  On top of that it can give some slick renderings for presentations.  The only drawback is you need to buy the licenses for each module to do the more in-depth things, such as ventilation air flow modeling.  But then again you don't have to buy everything if you're not going to use it.

Good topic.  We use energypro, equest, visualdoe to do our energy modeling.
However, unless you have experience in this software (and even if you have
extensive experience!), input errors are likely. 

 

Have you found the IES system to be valuable and easy to learn?  I've been
hearing a lot about IES and would like to know more about its daylight and
energy modeling capabilities.

Kevin - Try looking at your supply air temperatures and resets. The heating
load could actually be reheat depending on how you are modeling the supply
air temperature control. A review of the SS-L for that system will give you
an idea of the amount of simultaneous heating and cooling that is occurring.

Hi All,

 

I'm running a 210 ft2 room in eQuest and have assigned generic fabric spec
and a fan coil system with baseboard heating and the location is London. One
of the facades is glazing. When looking at the demand summary the heating
demand is massive relative to all other energy demands (4 times greater than
cooling demand in Summer!). Could anyone suggest what I might be doing
wrong? I've looked at air flow rates, u-values, glazing and nothing seems to
reduce it to what may be expected.

 

Kind Regards,

I, Sir, beg to differ with eQuest needing "infinite data."  The list of requirements you just stated shows me you need a great deal of input as it is.
 
eQuest can read an Auto Cad .DWG layout into the tracing function (in the Design Development Wizard). One can then trace each floor and its zones as accurately as you can.
 
After having done "raw" DOE-2.1 A thru E since 1984, eQuest is a blessing, although not perfect (we need solar water heating added).
 
But I am currently doing a LEED bound new museum, with 4 floors that are not anywhere close to the same footprint, and with varying atrium highs. I expect the entire model to be done, zones, HVAC, utility rates, etc, with 60 man hours. And I didn't trace Auto Cad files either, rather free hand traced them.
 
I find it very helpful.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Energy Modeling Software Recommendations for
Architects

 

All:

Of course there are many software options for building performance
modeling.  As an architecture studio we are concerned more w/ developing
form, assemblies, daylighting models, water use, etc... to develop good
building practice and are less interested in getting overwhelmed by all
the data required by software like eQuest.  I noticed that the DOE is
developing an EnergyPlus plug-in for SketchUp which sounds promising.

 

What software is recommended for developing a simple but useful in-house
design tool for schematic building performance modeling?  Something that
allows us to modify and evaluate the effects of building orientation,
form, fenestrations as well as insulation values, mechanical systems,
lighting, etc...  Preferably something that simulates performance from a
3D model (like SKP) not infinite fields of data inputs (like eQuest).

 

Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!

I, Sir, beg to differ with eQuest needing "infinite data."  The list of
requirements you just stated shows me you need a great deal of input as
it is.
 
eQuest can read an Auto Cad .DWG layout into the tracing function (in
the Design Development Wizard). One can then trace each floor and its
zones as accurately as you can.
 
After having done "raw" DOE-2.1 A thru E since 1984, eQuest is a
blessing, although not perfect (we need solar water heating added).
 
But I am currently doing a LEED bound new museum, with 4 floors that are
not anywhere close to the same footprint, and with varying atrium highs.
I expect the entire model to be done, zones, HVAC, utility rates, etc,
with 60 man hours. And I didn't trace Auto Cad files either, rather free
hand traced them.
 
I find it very helpful.

I am currently modeling a hockey arena.  There will be a chilled water system installed for year round ice maintenance.  Has anyone had any experience with modeling this type of application?  Is it possible to have a chilled radiant slab?

I'm not sure that's unreasonable - especially for a building of that
size (210 ft2) - the skin loads are pretty significant. There also seems
to be a large glazing area. Looking at weather charts for London, the
summers are really mild (highs in the upper 70s is a non existent summer
for a lot of places), so for a skin dominated building, your loads
wouldn't be that high. The winters are pretty cold though.
 
I guess it depends on how you modeled your internal heat gain (lights,
equipment, people) , outside air changes and infiltration rates. If you
are trying to model a small room in a larger building, then you might
want to make sure you have the internal walls modeled adiabatically (or
some other appropriate way). Looking at the balance point temperature
would also be a good gut check.

Hi All,

 

I'm running a 210 ft2 room in eQuest and have assigned generic fabric
spec and a fan coil system with baseboard heating and the location is
London. One of the facades is glazing. When looking at the demand
summary the heating demand is massive relative to all other energy
demands (4 times greater than cooling demand in Summer!). Could anyone
suggest what I might be doing wrong? I've looked at air flow rates,
u-values, glazing and nothing seems to reduce it to what may be
expected.

 

Kind Regards,

It sounds like you were modeling the chiller plant in one of the
Wizards. You'll need to switch to Detailed Data Edit (under the Mode
menu). You'll then be able to model your plant, specifying different
chiller sizes and types (you'll also get access to more chiller options
in the Detailed Data Edit Mode. When in the Detailed Data Edit Mode, you
can right-click on entry fields and select Item Help to see what the
DOE-2.2 manual says about the variable or topic (for example, the EIR or
electric input ratio is the inverse of the COP at rated or design
conditions, depending on how you set the SPECIFIED-AT variable).

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] chiller plant optimization



We are looking to model a complex chiller plant which has six chillers
of different sizes. I started to model the building in e-quest and
noticed that we can model only two sizes and types of chillers, i.e. we
can model three screw compressor chillers of 1000 tons and three
centrifugal hermetic chillers of 800 tons, but we can not model six
chillers of different sizes or types. I was wondering whether there is
any way to tweak e-quest to make this model work.

 

If it's difficult or impractical to model this in e-quest, which
building software would you recommend to achieve this? Our main goal
here is to optimize the chiller plant by running different scenarios,
different chiller sequencing, different supply temperatures,
retrofitting chillers by installing VFD's etc...

 

 

Thanks & Regards,

manually edit your input file. Search the DOE-2.2 "Dictionary" pdf for
"ice" and/or "ice-rink." Most or all of the unique keywords are in the
ZONE command. The brine chiller will probably need to be defined by
custom curves as it supplies 20F fluid. 

 

Then run the dll or exe bdl/sim versions of DOE-2.2 instead of eQuest.

 

Having said that, many of the most efficient AHUs now used to condition
these spaces are not well-represented by the systems modeled directly in
DOE2.2/eQUEST.

I am currently modeling a hockey arena.  There will be a chilled water
system installed for year round ice maintenance.  Has anyone had any
experience with modeling this type of application?  Is it possible to
have a chilled radiant slab?

Hello,

 

I am wondering if there are any programs for determining system
optimization, specifically in staging boilers.  Can one make specific
setpoints in doe-2 for determining how to sequence staged boilers for best
results?  If not can it done in e-plus?

The typical market condo in downtown Toronto has a two-pipe fan coil 
with an electric coil for heating during the change over 
season.  This is near to impossible to easily model with 
DOE2.1e.  Does equest include the capability to include electric 
backup with the TPTC hydronic system?

Some of this information you will need to obtain from the manufacturer of the blinds to be installed in the building. 

*	The shading schedule is a multiplier value that effectively reduces the shading coefficient of the window depending on the time of day
*	The maximum solar sch determines when the shade will close based on solar gain. When the solar gain reaches the value in the schedule for that hour, it will close the blind
*	The sun control probability is the likelihood of someone actually closing the blinds when the "triggers" go off. This should never be "1" unless they are automatic blinds with sensors in them. People are not in their office 100 percent of the time and different HVAC systems may cause some people to leave blinds open or close them too soon.
*	The open shade sch is the likelihood of someone opening the blinds when the triggers are reset. Some people might close a blind, turn on the light in their office, then forget to open the blind, even if the sun is on the other side of the building. This again should never be 1 unless there are sensors.
*	Conductance minimum T sch lowers the blinds if the outside air dry bulb temp is below the stated threshold value.
*	Solar Transmittance is used for daylighting, which says how much light is penetrating the blinds. This is determined by the manufacturer of the blinds in the building.

You will have to create some of your own schedules for this, but remember, you have to make a DAY schedule first, then a WEEK schedule, and then an ANNUAL schedule, all with the same name, but with DAY, WEEK, or ANNUAL before it. This helps with continuity and avoids confusion. 
 
I have used shading on a couple of buildings, and both have shown little savings. 
 
Hope this helps,

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Blind control in eQuest



Dear All,

 

I am running a very simple model in eQuest. I would like to control the blind operation based on the solar radiation levels and report its operation in the simulation results document.

 

The set up I have at the moment is defined in the detailed mode, at window level and goes as follows:

 

Shading Schedule:                     Schedule MULTIPLIER

Shading Type:                           Mov  able interior

Maximum Solar Schedule:          Schedule RADIATION                             Max Solar Control: Transmitted Total

Sun Control Probability:              1.0

 

Open shade schedule:                undefined

Conductance min-T schedule:     undefined

Solar Transmittance schedule:    undefined

 

Is this correct? I have tried using something other than Schedule MULTIPLIER in the shading schedule and it doesn't seem to work.

Do I need to define the undefined schedules. The help information is confusing when available.

 

Finally how do I report this information in the simulation results document. Any input would be greatly appreciated.

 

Kind Regards,

 

Kevin Burke

Hi all,

Does anyone know of published measured data comparing infiltration rates
with batt versus wet blown-in cellulose insulation in a stud cavity?  I have
one study by David Yuill that was very informative, but I'd like to find
some additional sources.

Thanks,

Christina,

Over the past 2-3 years, I have been using BPS, namely IES, not for code 
compliance but for actual design of demonstration buildings, such as the 
Low Energy Office and  Zero Energy Office in Malaysia. Extensive use of 
daylighting simulation were conducted to ensure that the building will 
get evenly distributed daylight for most of the daytime hours while 
energy simulation were conducted to ensure that the system in place have 
reasonable payback periods while meeting the energy target.

Kind regards,

CK

Complience with the Model National Energy Code in Canada is 
demonstrated using DOE2.1e.  The now defunct Commercial Building 
Incentive Program provided incentives of up to $60,000 for projects 
that could show a 25% reduction in energy use over the MNECB 
Reference case using whole building energy simulation with DOE2.1e.

LEED and LEED Canada both require simulation to show compliance and 
to achieve credit points based on the amount of energy cost savings 
demonstrated using DOE2.1e, DOE2.2, EnergyPlus, <others??>.

Hi Christina,

 

DOE2/eQuest is used in Australia as part of a voluntary but influential
rating system called ABGR (Australian Building Greenhouse Gas Rating).

 

IES is a National Calculation Method approved tool for complying with
England/Wales' Building Regulations concerning the conservation of fuel
and energy.

 

I believe DOE2/eQuest may be used in California also as part of
regulation compliance measures.

 

Kind Regards

 

Kevin Burke

Dear all,

 

It appears that in practice building performance simulation (BPS) is
only used for code compliance checking in the Netherlands.

 

I am curious how that is in other countries. I would be really
interested in your professional opinion and I am looking forward to an
interesting discussion on this subject.

Jeffrey,

I think your assumption is valid. As you have rightly mentioned that the Baseline Building envelope would reflect the existing envelope conditions (Table G3.1, Section 5, item (f)). 

Lighting, usage, schedules, occupancy for the Baseline Building are governed by Table G3.1, Sections 2, 3 and 4 which are 'Same as Proposed Design'. 

Keeping the function as a warehouse (occupancy, lighting, schedules, etc) in the baseline and comparing it with the proposed design as an office would not be a valid approach. 

Hope this answers your question.


Best regards,

Gaurav Mehta

  Hello All,

   

  Can someone please help with this interpretation?

   

  Table G3.1, Section 5, Building Envelope, Item (f) under Baseline Building indicates that baseline envelope conditions shall reflect the existing conditions prior to revision. The project I am modeling is an existing building that had single pane glass and CMU walls with no insulation. The internal use of the existing building was quite different from the new (we are going from a warehouse to an office). I assume, then, that the Baseline Building will reflect the existing envelope conditions but with the new conditions (i.e. lighting, space usage, schedules, occupancy, etc.) and the Proposed Building will reflect the improved building envelope (with, of course, the other energy efficiency measures designed into the renovated building).

   

  Is this a valid assumption?

Kelly Speakes is presently sustainable strategies leader and a UTC representative to the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) Energy Efficiency in Buildings (EEB) Project. Speakes has been active for ten years in the distributed and decentralized generation markets, representing global providers of equipment and services. She is the author of several published articles in energy trade magazines such as Power Economics and Energy Central. Speakes holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from Boston University.
 
Kelly's talk will include an overview and status of the EEB project.  See the full abstract below:
 
The World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) is a coalition of 190 multi-national corporations whose shared commitment to sustainable development and practices are recognized around the world.  In 2006, the WCBSD launched the Energy Efficiency in Buildings (EEB) Project, a three year effort led by co-chairs Lafarge and United Technologies Corporation, with a vision of a world where buildings consume zero net energy. The 10 member companies of the project, many of which are Fortune 500 companies in the field of building products and services, represent the voice of business in their effort to issue and promote a comprehensive and credible action plan to achieve the vision, focusing on six key global markets:  Brazil, China, Europe, India, Japan, and US.
 
Buildings consume roughly 40% of the world's energy resources and are a significant contributor to carbon emissions. In the urgency to transform the building sector, a zero net energy building is an aggressive and necessary response to global energy and climate change issues.  These actions can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of the world's cities. In the short term, energy efficiency improvements can be achieved through a holistic approach to building design, construction and operation, driven by increased awareness and changes in behavior. In the longer term, facilitation by process and information technology, products and services that support these outcomes, financial mechanisms to prove them economically viable and balanced encouragement through policy and regulation are necessary to transform the industry. 
 
By summer 2007 this three year effort will assess the current state of the building industry and analyze the opportunities and barriers.  By May 2008, conduct scenario analysis to overcome financial and institutional barriers that inhibit zero net energy buildings. By May 2009, issue and promote a comprehensive and credible action plan, using stakeholder roadmap validation.
 
This presentation will include an overview and status of the EEB project. The project's key themes of market perceptions that shape financial mechanisms and institutional barriers, holistic technical approaches, and behaviors and awareness will be discussed.  Finally, the presentation will provide an assessment on the role of equipment and energy efficiency improvements and standards in driving down overall energy consumption in the US in various commercial and consumer product areas.

                                                          
Reservations:      To make a reservation contact Peter Ellis < peter_ellis at nrel.gov> via email by June 19, 2007, 5 PM (MDT).  Confirmation of reservations will be sent via email (if you do not receive a confirmation within two business days, please resend your reservation request).

Jeff, 
I would agree, if you are using appendix G your baseline would have to
match the mandatory and prescriptive envelope requirements.  That said,
if there was an exception buried somewhere in the text (Either section 4
or 5) that would allow the existing envelope to remain as is, then that
would be your baseline to compare.
 
What you should do is read thru and see what the envelope requirements
would be if you were just going in for a regular minimally comply with
the standard building permit and use that as your baseline, then worry
about G and any particulars therin.

Jeff,
That's a tricky one. I am assuming that as a warehouse, the building
would fall into the semi heated category. In which case switching the
functions might mean that your base building should comply with the
fully heated standard. 
 
Don't know if that's actually the case though.

Hello

Do you know any program that can calculate the cost of doe22 library material?
I look for code program that work like doe22 dll files that I give it 
inp file and then the program calculate the cost of material and other 
cost(I want to use USA price).
Can you help me or any advise that I can do this work?

It also depends on your overall control sequences for when you intend to
operate the whole system.  We once audited a large government office
building where the building engineers were responding to a governor's order
to reduce energy consumption by keeping the chillers / towers, etc. off in
the morning until the outdoor temperature exceeded a certain temperature
(maybe 80 deg. F).  The resulting energy consumption for the building was
actually higher than the previous energy use.  This was because when the
chillers were turned on, they had to operate at higher lift conditions, and
were therefore operating less efficiently than they otherwise would have.
Meanwhile, the indoor temperatures of the building had been creeping up all
morning (due to outdoor air conditions, interior loads, and fan heat added
to the air stream), so the cooling demand was much higher when the chillers
were turned on than it would have been if the chillers had been turned on
earlier in the morning.  Also, the VSD fans had been operating at 100% all
morning, and continued operating at 100% after the mechanical cooling
systems had been turned on, since a higher volume of air was required to get
the building back to reasonable comfort conditions.  If the mechanical
cooling had been turned on earlier, the fan energy would have been much less
throughout the day.

There's definitely a right application of air-side economizer and night
ventilation controls to limit mechanical cooling (and these are all
modelable within energy simulation tools), but integrated control between
free cooling (air-side economizers / night ventilation w/ thermal mass) and
mechanical cooling systems tends to provide the highest levels of comfort,
and can provide the best levels of efficiency if controlled correctly.

I'm guessing if you have no operable windows and you have occupancy at that time, you will have a LOT of unhappy campers - regardless of climate type. You need fresh air to be productive.  One option could be to maintain fan power and fresh air, but set the temperature higher (in tropical climates).
 
Lighting reduction will depend on how well you design the spaces for daylight harvesting. Again - you don't want people working in the dark. 
 
Hope this helps.

Dear All,

What are the chances that reducing HVAC operating hours (i.e. starting it at 9.00am rather than 8.30am in the morning and shutting it down 30 minutes before closing hours), will affect indoor air quality and productivity in office buildings in Tropical climates.

Additionally, could lighting period be reduced during the working period and for how long within the same tropical conditions.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200706151016.AA1650468pd80001437126@gard.com>

Dear all,
 
The following recently  published papers may be of interest to  some of
you involved in fenestration and computer simulation.  The first paper
presents the development of new metrics to rate complex fenestration
products with regards to aspects of indoor environment quality, namely:
view impairment index  (which is used to evaluate the outdoor or indoor
view-privacy), luminance index (which links to discomfort glare), light
diffusion quality index (which links to luminance uniformity on work
planes).  The second paper presents the underlying theory and detailed
calculation procedures.  The procedures include models for the glazing
assembly and models for special glazing panes such as a clear substrate
with applied or laminated scattering film, composite film made up of a
number of homogeneous materials, and screen-like glazing panes such as
insect/shading screens, roller blinds, drapery sheets, honeycomb
transparent insulation and fibreglass translucent glazing.  The models
are implemented in a new version of SkyVision (not released yet).
 
 
Complex fenestration systems  are defined as any window product which
incorporates a non-clear  (scattering)  pane in the glazing assembly or
in its attachment.  Examples include: switchable glazing, translucent or
transparent insulation, solar control films doped with nano-particles,
patterned/fritted glass, and shading devices.  CFS may yield better
thermal, lighting and energy performance than regular  clear  windows,
but may have adverse effect on building's occupant satisfaction:  they
may impair the view through and increase the risk of discomfort glare.
Adding these new ratings to the exiting  energy ratings (U-value, SHGC,
VT) will help in the pre-selection of CFS prior to their installation in
buildings to avoid any detrimental effect on occupant satisfaction and
energy performance of the installed product.

That's too hard to say.  It would depend on the systems used & modeled.
Most can tell you exactly how much energy a fan is pouring out, and you
can run a few quick simulations in Carrier's HAP to figure out how much
is fan vs. chillers & pumps.  BTW, coils don't have an energy use
associated with them.

Mike,

That is not exactly correct, 189P is including Appendix G (called
Appendix D in 189P) in their document as a normative appendix. So if
189P gets approved there will be a normative set of simulation rules for
the industry to use. It remains to be seen how 90.1 and 189 will operate
as jurisdiction begin to adopt 189. That will be a great seminar for a
future ASHRAE meeting. John Hogan was the chair of 189 and with the City
of Seattle he might have some ideas about how these two standards will
operate. 

I wrote a few weeks back suggesting that some Bldg-Sim people might want
to comment on Appendix G becoming normative. The 189P is currently under
public review with the comment period open until July 9th. The draft can
be downloaded from the ASHRAE web-site.

David,

ASHRAE has changed the process for Appendix G since it is informative
and not normative. It no longer goes out for public review, nor are
official addenda issued. It just gets changed. I am not happy about
this, and it may change after the June ASHRAE meeting in Long Beach.
Anyway, the corresponding changes to G have been incorporated, and will
be released soon in the 2007 version. I am not sure how you deal with it
in the meantime

Can someone point me to the reference where the addendum ac fan power
calculation method is incorporated to Appendix G?

I can see how this would tie into the ECB method, but there isn't
anything in the addendum document pointing to Appendix G.

ASHRAE 90.1 2004 Appendix G has pressure credits for filters, but not
for energy recovery devices. 

Thus, it would appear that any situation where energy recovery is
required, the as designed fan system is at a disadvantage since the
baseline fan bhp is calculated without any pressure credit, but the as
design system is sized to include the pressure drop through the energy
recovery device.  I've looked for interpretations on this, but could not
find any.  Does anyone know of a ruling on this? 

 

Thanks, 

Mike

David,

ASHRAE has changed the process for Appendix G since it is informative and not normative. It no longer goes out for public review, nor are official addenda issued. It just gets changed. I am not happy about this, and it may change after the June ASHRAE meeting in Long Beach. Anyway, the corresponding changes to G have been incorporated, and will be released soon in the 2007 version. I am not sure how you deal with it in the meantime

Can someone point me to the reference where the addendum ac fan power calculation method is incorporated to Appendix G?

I can see how this would tie into the ECB method, but there isn't anything in the addendum document pointing to Appendix G.

Thanks!

ASHRAE 90.1 2004 Appendix G has pressure credits for filters, but not for energy recovery devices. 

Thus, it would appear that any situation where energy recovery is required, the as designed fan system is at a disadvantage since the baseline fan bhp is calculated without any pressure credit, but the as design system is sized to include the pressure drop through the energy recovery device.  I've looked for interpretations on this, but could not find any.  Does anyone know of a ruling on this?

Use CO2 sensors in the spaces.  Have a maximum setting for each, with no
allowance for averaging among them.  If any single sensor hits, say,
1000 PPM, the AHU providing outside air should respond by opening the OA
damper.  This control scheme also works well for spaces with changing
occupancy, such as an entire office goes to lunch.  The control logic is
in addition to cooling demand, but works well to save energy from
conditioning the same amount of outside air all day long, every day.  

 

For reducing the lighting load, we have approached it several ways.  One
method was to provide occupancy sensors for each desk, office or area.
Corridors were always lit.  Another was to provide a sophisticated light
sensor system that could energize & dim the lights to maintain an
acceptable lighting level.  This works well for saving energy when you
need to most - hot, sunny days.  It also responds gradually to cloudy
days so that the occupants don't even notice the levels changing.  Each
of these was more expensive, and you are taking control out of the hands
of the occupants for the most part - something most people hate to give
up.

I'm guessing if you have no operable windows and you have occupancy at
that time, you will have a LOT of unhappy campers - regardless of
climate type. You need fresh air to be productive.  One option could be
to maintain fan power and fresh air, but set the temperature higher (in
tropical climates).

 

Lighting reduction will depend on how well you design the spaces for
daylight harvesting. Again - you don't want people working in the dark. 

 

Hope this helps.

Dear All,

What are the chances that reducing HVAC operating hours (i.e. starting
it at 9.00am rather than 8.30am in the morning and shutting it down 30
minutes before closing hours), will affect indoor air quality and
productivity in office buildings in Tropical climates.

Additionally, could lighting period be reduced during the working period

Hello All,

I apologize if this question should not be addressed in this forum.

But if you have any input, it will be greatly appreciated.

 

If the project is in China, where the local electric motor runs on 50Hz
frequency, how do you comply with section 10 of the standard? Does this make
us exempted from the mandatory provisions of 10.4?

 

Thanks, I appreciate any feedback.

Hello,

Does anyone know if eQUEST is a good tool for modelling a small single zone space (20m?) with an autosized plant?  We are getting high pump energy use and low space cooling energy use and would like to troubleshoot the problem.  This model is used to test the performance of the fa?ade, so we did not want to build up the entire building as of yet.

Thanks,

Thank you for your response,  Larry and Bing.
   
  Actually my question is, what is the number that I should set for the Infiltarion rate in the ASHRAE 90.1-2004 complianec base case model.
   
  The building envelope has 50% window to wall wall ratio (innore the door). So if we model the base case with 2L/s.m2 per window area, then we can set the infiltration rate as 1 L/s.m2 per exterior wall area in the base case. Is this method applicalbe?
   
  Regards,
   
  David

  It??s possible that the sources you referenced are looking at two different situations.  The ASHRAE section 5.4.3.2 addresses only fenestration and door products, whereas the eQuest defaults are probably for the entire wall.  A standard sheet-rocked walls air permeance rate is around 0.004 cfm/s.f., while the Section 5.4.3.2 rate for fenestration products is 0.4 cfm/s.f. (100 times greater.)  It would make sense that the entire wall (after average weighting these surfaces) might be around 0.04 cfm/s.f.  I don??t believe that ASHRAE 90.1 addresses the entire wall infiltration rate (just joint sealing and fenestration products.)

    Dear all,

     

    I have a question about the infiltration rate in the ASHRAE 90.1-2004. As we simulate the base case building energy use, we try to find out what is the reference infiltration rate setup up by ASHRAE 90.1-2004. However, we only find in section 5.4.3.2 (page 180) value is "2.0 L/s.m2 for other products". When we use e-QUEST to simulate the building energy use, we found that the default infiltration rate is set as 0.038 CFM/ft2 for exterior wall area, which is about 0.2 L/s.m2 per exterior wall area.

     

    Could somebody tell me what is the reference infiltration rate per square exterior wall area based on ASHRAE 90.1-2004.

     

    Thank you very much for your help in advance.

     

    Regards,

     

    David

Tianzhen,
 
ASHRAE 90.1-2004 doesn't address the infiltration rate in terms of
infiltration rate per square foot of exterior wall area.  The default
value of 0.038 cfm/sf of exterior wall area in eQUEST may be derived
from the old ASHRAE Standard 1989 version.  It is always a challenge to
define the infiltration rate in the commercial buildings.  It is worthy
to read a field test report by NIST, titled as Analysis of Ventilation

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Infiltration rate in ASHRAE 90.1-2004


Dear all,
 
I have a question about the infiltration rate in the ASHRAE 90.1-2004.
As we simulate the base case building energy use, we try to find out
what is the reference infiltration rate setup up by ASHRAE 90.1-2004.
However, we only find in section 5.4.3.2 (page 180) value is "2.0 L/s.m2
for other products". When we use e-QUEST to simulate the building energy
use, we found that the default infiltration rate is set as 0.038 CFM/ft2
for exterior wall area, which is about 0.2 L/s.m2 per exterior wall
area.
 
Could somebody tell me what is the reference infiltration rate per
square exterior wall area based on ASHRAE 90.1-2004.
 
Thank you very much for your help in advance.
 
Regards,
 
David

Hello,

Has anyone ever tried modelling a heat pump that connects an LPHW loop and a CHW loop in eQUEST?  If so, how do you model it properly?

Regards,
Irene

David,
 
It's possible that the sources you referenced are looking at two
different situations.  The ASHRAE section 5.4.3.2 addresses only
fenestration and door products, whereas the eQuest defaults are probably
for the entire wall.  A standard sheet-rocked walls air permeance rate
is around 0.004 cfm/s.f., while the Section 5.4.3.2 rate for
fenestration products is 0.4 cfm/s.f. (100 times greater.)  It would
make sense that the entire wall (after average weighting these surfaces)
might be around 0.04 cfm/s.f.  I don't believe that ASHRAE 90.1
addresses the entire wall infiltration rate (just joint sealing and
fenestration products.)

ASHRAE 90.1 2004 Appendix G has pressure credits for filters, but not
for energy recovery devices. 
Thus, it would appear that any situation where energy recovery is
required, the as designed fan system is at a disadvantage since the
baseline fan bhp is calculated without any pressure credit, but the as
design system is sized to include the pressure drop through the energy
recovery device.  I?ve looked for interpretations on this, but could not
find any.  Does anyone know of a ruling on this?

Xiang,
 
If I had to guess the problem isn't a bug in eQuest but something with how
you have setup the model.  I just went and looked at a couple of old models
from buildings in SLC, UT I did earlier this year with IDEC and I didn't
have any problems with heating penalties.  I just double checked by
simulating several parametric runs just turning the IDEC on/off and my
heating energy was within 1%.  I also got the same results using both eQuest
3.61 and eQuest 3.60.

Hi Everyone,
 
We are evalulating energy savings from an IDEC system for a LEED office
building with eQUEST, and ran into a huge gas penalty. To maximize the
savings, all supply air passes through the IDEC system. Our conversations
with other modelers indicated many of them had similar problem. I was
wondering if there is a good explanation for this gas consumption increase
and whether there is a right way to simulate the IDEC if the gas penalty is
a bug. Thanks.
