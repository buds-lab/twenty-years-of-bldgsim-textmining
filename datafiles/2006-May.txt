Subject: [bldg-sim] List working again - I hope
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200605310847.AA4724468pd80001111689@gard.com>

Monday over 20 spam messages came through the BLDG-SIM 
mailing list.  Due to this, I disabled the list yesterday. 
After some investigation, I think I see how a spammer 
figured out how to get around the filters and I changed 
them so it would not happen again (I hope).  The list is 
back up and running so feel free to send in your questions 
about building energy simulation. 

My apologies,

Jason

Subject: [bldg-sim] sky model(s)/weather file algorithm used in DOE-2.2
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200605300052.AA5210578pd80001109508@gard.com>

My question is based on a question and answer I am quoting from the summer
1998 Building energy simulation user news on the LBL website (page 23 of
http://gundog.lbl.gov/dirun/1902.pdf ). The user's question and Fred
winkelmann's answer are as following:

"Question: Is there a method of reading in total horizontal illuminance from
an
  external file and eliminating the need for the turbidity and moisture
values?

Answer: The soon-to-be-released DOE-2.2 bypasses the need for atmospheric
turbidity
values -- it uses the same Perez algorithm as used in the TMY2s to calculate
exterior illuminance for measured solar radiation, sun position and other
quantities available on the weather file. It also calculates atmospheric
moisture
hourly from dewpoint temperature, so the monthly average atmospheric
  moisture values are no longer needed. This approach is also being
incorporated
in DOE-2.1E and should be available later this year."

Does this mean that later versions of DOE-2.1E released by LBL and
DOE-2.2/eQUEST
use perez all weather sky model or is the change only specific to an
algorithm used in the weather file while the sky models remain the same
standard clear and overcast?

Thanks in advance,
Ramana.

Rajan,

I gave up on ConstructDWG method many years ago.

I suggest using ConstructDXF, i.e. export autocad drawing in dxf first.

Kind regards,

CK

Best contact support at iesve.com.
It would appear that IES VE did not install properly or the  
distribution was missing this file.

Venkata,

(Sorry for cross-posting against the Radiance general discussion list)

As DAYSIM weather files are based on Energy Plus weather files, you could just convert Energy Plus files directly into DOE-2/eQuest bin files using the eQ_WthProc executable from the DOE-2 web site:

http://doe2.com/index_Wth.html

Hope this helps,

Hello all,

I need to modify the direct normal and total horizontal solar values in the
BIN format TMY2 weather file used by DOE-2/eQUEST to ensure both DAYSIM and
DOE-2 provide the same exterior horizontal illuminance. Any pointers on how
this can be done or an alternative approach will be appreciated.

IES VE is only available on disk - you have to order it from them.

Dear Bruno,

We at your own faculty (FEUP) have people with some years of experience 
with building simulation (ESP-r, DOE, TRNSYS, E+...).
We invite you to show up at the Heat and Fluids Section of the 
Mechanical Engineering Department (SFC-DEMEGI), where we can discuss 
these matters. Contact me, Jose Luis Alexandre or Petra Vaquero if you 
want.
And YES, we also know where to find the E+ manuals...

Kind regards,
V?tor Leal

You should find all the information you need to select a simulation
tool at the following site:

http://www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/tools_directory/pdfs/

and look for the file
contrasting_the_capabilities_of_building_energy_performance_simulation_programs_v1.0.pdf

there should also be an IBPSA paper in the same folder with the name
comparative_paper.pdf

Hi! My name is Bruno and i?m a student at Faculdade de Engenharia da
Universidade do Porto (FEUP).
I?m sending this mail to see if someone could advise me some program in
wich i could
analyse simple passive solar systems like trombe walls, direct gains from
windows, ...
I was hoping you could refer to me a program that could, not only give me
heat balance and heat demands, but also, give me
inside temperatures and confort mesures.

If you go to the water-side tab and then right-click on the topmost entry on the components tree, you should get the option to create lots of different elements including the GSHP wells.

Does anyone have a documented source of elevator electricity consumption numbers for a typical office building? What would a normal number be in terms of % of overall building consumption?

Does anyone have a documented source of elevator electricity consumption
numbers for a typical office building? What would a normal number be in

I agree with Glenn, it doesn't seem like LEED-NC shoudl be used for a 
lab/manufacturing site.

Hi folks,
   
  I  am not sure if the topic is worth of discussion.
   
  When browsing its web sites I happen to find that Intel anounces one of its sustainable goals that is to register its first LEED project by the end of 2006. It comes up to my mind if LEED rating system works for semiconductor factories, which basically consist of fab and assembling and testing factories.
   
  Both of the two type of factories, esp. fab ones, have very intensive processing load, large volume of poisonous exhaust such as acid steam, large amount of chemical wastes, and water treatment that are specifically designed. Fab factories mandates 24-hour operation and extremely high system reliability such as Intel's N+1 requirement.
   
  I don't think measures can be taken to optimize mechanical system even through simulation due to the complicated processing requirement. Such ECMs as waterside heat recovery, variable primary flow systems, DC FFUs are already utilized or even standard configuration of current fab factories. I don't know how much building performance would be improved as a result of optimizing building envelop, lighting, etc.. when process load is very high (say 300~500 W/sq. m). And if my understanding is correct LEED NC 2.2 and ASHRAE 90-2004 stipulate that all energy end use including processing and equipment load be taken into account when rating the energy performance.
   
  And compared to the large amount of water required for processing,  the amount of water for irrigation or flushing is negligible. And totally different from an office environment, to talk about IEQ in a sealed space full of chemical exhaust such as SOx, NOx doesn't make much sense.
   
  I believe that a fab factory could be qualified for LEED certificate or even Silver if carefully designed. I am just wondering whether the factory can really benefit a lot from LEED other than marketing or corporate image that is considered.
   
  I may be missing something due to my limited knowledge or my understanding is completely wrong. I highly appreciate if  I am informed of any good case study of semiconductor factories in US.
   
  Thanks for any comments and advice.
   
  Glenn Wu

Chaoqin,
   I imagine that it depends upon the software tool that you choose for 
your simulation. You could certainly create such a system using TRNSYS and 
evaluate whether or not combining space and water heating is a worthwhile idea.
Kind regards,
  David

Hi, 

Is it possible to combine the water loop for space
heaing and domestic hot water together in a commercial
building? What are the potential problems or
difficulties? 

I think the two loops require different water quality,
but not really sure if this is the case. The two loops
might also require different water temperature. How
should the gas burner cater for this?

Thanks,
Chaoqin

Please excuse the cross-postings...


Registration for SimBuild 2006 is now open!  Please visit our website (www.ibpsa.us) to register for the conference and apply for on-campus housing.  

Student scholarships up to $500 are also now available!  See the website for details.



Pre-registration fees (through July 17, 2006):

Three-day registration (full conference)        $380
Student registration                            $180
One-day registration for practitioner day       $180 

Full registration fees (after July 17, 2006):

Three-day registration (full conference)        $400
Student registration                            $180
One-day registration for practitioner day       $200 




SimBuild 2006

IBPSA-USA will hold its second national conference, August 2-4, 2006 on the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  The format will be similar to the successful SimBuild 2004 held at the University of Colorado, Boulder.  Technical sessions over two days will feature presentations on a wide range of topics related to the simulation of HVAC equipment, airflow in buildings, energy usage, and the visual and acoustic environment in buildings, as well as demonstrations of simulation software and of hardware and software needed to emulate or measure the performance of buildings.   Friday will be a practitioner day, offering case studies, hands-on software demonstrations and other presentations aimed at giving practicing architects and engineers the information they need to be more informed collaborators with simulation experts.  The practitioner day will be coordinated with local US Green Building Council chapters and affiliates.  Training workshops by various software vendors are being scheduled for the Monday and Tuesday preceding the conference - further details will be announced later. 

Conference housing will be offered on campus in dormitories and in nearby hotels.  Single- and double-occupancy dormitory rooms will range in price from about $65 to $110 per night.

The meeting is open to all, world-wide.  Boston is a convenient destination for travelers from major cities in the U.S. and in many other countries.  It is a historic and compact city, easily explored on foot and via public transportation.  Conference participants may want to stay longer and explore New England's mountains and Atlantic coast, from Maine to Connecticut.  MIT has a growing number of architecturally significant buildings that participants can visit, including recent work by Frank Gehry, Steven Holl, and Kevin Roche, and earlier projects by I.M. Pei, Eero Saarinen, and Finnish master Alvar Aalto.   Harvard University and Harvard Square are a short distance away.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200605171218.AA1810250pd80001092301@gard.com>

Hi all,

 

We are modeling a displacement ventilation system in eQuest.  Currently, the
system is set up as a PVVT, with the return air path set to plenum zones and
an economizer with dual enthalpy outside air control.  We have distributed
some of the heat loads to the plenum zones in order to simulate the
stratification in a displacement ventilation system.  I am wondering if the
return air will be appropriately heated by the heat loads in the plenum
zone, and if this higher temperature return air will be appropriately
modeled by the dual enthalpy economizer.  Also, how would you suggest
diagnosing this to see if it is working correctly?

 

Thanks,

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200605161407.AA0714984pd80001091121@gard.com>

Hello,

I'm trying to use eQuest to compare centralized vs. decentralized plant
options, and I'm running into a problem because you cannot assign
multiple loops to a single piece of central plant equipment.  My model
contains 4 buildings and the three basic plant options are:

1.	Decentralized: Water Source Heat Pumps with a loop at each
building. Cooling tower and boiler at each building. 
2.	Semi-decentralized:  Water Source Heat Pumps with a loop at each
building. Boiler at each building, central cooling tower.
3.	Centralized:  Centralized chilled water plant serving 4 pipe
FCUs.  Central cooling towers and boilers. 

Option 1 is straightforward to model, but I need to assign a single
cooling tower to four loops for Option 2.  Is this possible?  The pump
heads for the loop and equipment pumps vary greatly between the options,
so I really need to be able to specify these building loops
individually.

Thank you!

Andrew Marsh the key person behind Ecotect is back in circulation
(I saw him two days ago at a software fair hosted by IBPSA Scotland)
and Square One is planning a roll-out of a new Ecotect version in the
next week or two.  Based on that I would expect their web site and
emails to their existing client base to reflect that shortly if it has
not already done so.

It's interesting watching this forum over the past 5 or so years.  At the risk of putting TRNSYS, ESPr or EnergyPlus users offside, it has evolved from being a DOE-2.1E focussed to EQuest/2.2 focussed to now including a balanced discussion on a number of additional tools.  It is good to see the thermal analysis tools originating from Europe gathering interest in North America.

I have used DOE-2 and Apache (IES) for years and have watched both evolve.  I share Peter's sentiments and would add it actually has a GUI for all the modules and the modules do generally work together off the common geometry and templates - other programs promise this and don't deliver with a single module.  One frustration / challenge is that it can be quite easy to create large complex APhvac (the mechanical airside simulation) modules and when it comes time for debugging / quality reviews I have found it very difficlt to pin down what is going wrong or right.  Ultimately there is a means to get at all the information, but this can be time consuming.  Building up  model progressively can help mitigate these challenges, but IES and other programs could learn a lot from the structured and layered reporting of DOE-2.  Perhaps if more of us start asking for this then they will add key reports.  

While Apache is great on the airside it has limited functionality on the waterside so depending on where your design efforts are focussed you may be better off with EQuest /2.2 or other tools.  Also don't underestimate the value of macros and expressions in EQuest/2.2 where you need to change shading / glazing dimensions across a building at the stroke of a key or switch system operation without having to redraw / reset 50+ controllers ...

Another frustration of mine is ISO 7730 / ASHRAE 55 thermal comfort calculations which account for surface temperatures in a radiant temperature calculation but not any of the shortwave diffuse or beam radiation from the sky / sun. Apache has a compliant comfort calculation, but to get a full picture in facade design one needs to see the diffuse and preferably beam radiation factored in.  EDSL's TAS factors diffuse and Arup at the time I left still had a wonderful tool that factored both diffuse and beam.  It would be good to see other programs add this funcionality in.  Anyone who can do it with commercially available software would have my interest.  In Australia we get a lot of sun and it is 10-15% more intense in summer than for the same latitude in the north due to the earth's elliptical orbit around the sun so perhaps we focus on this more than other parts of the world.

Graham

  We have purchased the IES software and are extremely happy with the program and the results. The motor by the way is ESP developed by Joe Clarke and Don MacClean. For real buildings of 200,000 sf and up it does everything a mechanical design engineer could wish for and some more. The results are clear and concise, very user friendly.

  Hi Folks:

   

  I have just been made aware of IESVE software from a

  company in Scotland. It appears to do a bit of

  everything, from energy analysis to 3-D CFD to

  daylighting in 3-D rendering. Does anyone have a good

  handle on what this stuff actually is?

I was wondering if there is away to model a free cooling heat exchanger
in series with a chiller and powered by condenser water. That would
ensure continuous load reduction on the chiller when ambient
temperatures permit. I know we can add a heat exchanger in parallel with
the chillers as in conventional free cooling.

 

Thank you,

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200605102105.AA0528359pd80001084267@gard.com>

Having worked in design, I certainly do not concur.  My experience does
not indicate 115F commonality.  Where I worked, the standard practice
was to work with the owners and the people responsible for the
electronic equipment (whether it is computers or telephone switchers).
On top of the interviews, we built in a 2- to 3-times factor of safety
to allow for the ever advancing electronics technology which can pack
more and more Wattage into the same small box.  From talking with other
designers from other firms, this appeared to be standard protocol.
Remember, the market will dictate the poor designers from the good ones,
and the last thing you want to do is anger a customer from a sector that
is continually expanding.

I believe your experience is either witnessing computer rooms that the
owner performed ad hoc in an old storage room or closet, or possibly is
perhaps a decade old, and the owner had exceeded the FS put into the
design.  My experience indicates that in some cases, a FS of 3 can be
surpassed in as little as 5 years.  This is an extreme example where the
owner changed the functionality of the site.  Something the designer can
not allow for, or else the price would skyrocket.

I am not sure what ASHRAE says to do in this case, but it is an
irresponsible designer who cannot assess the job at hand and use the
most appropriate resources to provide for the scope of work.

Subject: [bldg-sim] "computer rooms" not what they used to be

It seems to me that HVAC professionals and IT professionals don't at all
mean the same thing when they talk about a "computer room." A couple
decades ago computer rooms still had interior glassed windows, one
locked door, a raised floor, held a "mainframe" computer, and had their
own A/C. But computers have gotten a whole lot smaller and "big iron" is
rare now.

Nowadays when an elevation plan says "computer room," that room will
commonly have few or no windows, no special doors, no hollow floor, hold
a whole bunch of "minicomputers" and "PC"s and "network hubs" and "UPS"s
on shelves or racks, and rely on the building A/C. Unfortunately the
computer equipment still generates a _huge_ amount of heat (even more
than the "mainframe" it replaced), which must be carried away (or
neutralized) immediately.

Overheated computer equipment becomes unreliable and has its lifespan
shortened significantly. But it seldom fails right away, so both HVAC
professionals and facility managers can easily be completely unaware of
the problem. It's all too common for a computer technician to arrive at
the office Monday morning only to find the "computer room" is 115
degrees; costly equipment had its life shortened before anyone even knew
there was a problem. There should at minimum be a temperature alarm in
the "computer room."

After complaining about the difference between common sense and what
building simulation programs recommend, I was told this disconnect is
due to "standard ASHRAE methodology" and not a flaw in any particular
building simulation tool. I feel it's time for the heating and cooling
profession to catch up with the reality of current "computer rooms."

This is just my two cents; what do other people think?

Dr. Vladimir Bazjanac,

Please accept my humble apologies.

I should not have posted rumors. I have no idea Singapore is still 
keeping the project alive after facing so many problems with it.

Anyway, as you mentioned it, it was not an IFC problem. Its the /lack of 
software/ problem. Hope to see this solved quickly and see some real 
'action' soon!

I, too,  am  looking forward to an totally interoperable CAD system for 
the construction industry. It will really solve many headache that we 
are getting now.

Please accept my apologies again for the misinformed rumors.


Kind regards,

CK Tang

Subject: [bldg-sim] "computer rooms" not what they used to be
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200605101514.AA1443218pd80001083844@gard.com>

It seems to me that HVAC professionals and IT professionals don't at all mean the same thing when they talk about a "computer room." A couple decades ago computer rooms still had interior glassed windows, one locked door, a raised floor, held a "mainframe" computer, and had their own A/C. But computers have gotten a whole lot smaller and "big iron" is rare now.

Nowadays when an elevation plan says "computer room," that room will commonly have few or no windows, no special doors, no hollow floor, hold a whole bunch of "minicomputers" and "PC"s and "network hubs" and "UPS"s on shelves or racks, and rely on the building A/C. Unfortunately the computer equipment still generates a _huge_ amount of heat (even more than the "mainframe" it replaced), which must be carried away (or neutralized) immediately.

Overheated computer equipment becomes unreliable and has its lifespan shortened significantly. But it seldom fails right away, so both HVAC professionals and facility managers can easily be completely unaware of the problem. It's all too common for a computer technician to arrive at the office Monday morning only to find the "computer room" is 115 degrees; costly equipment had its life shortened before anyone even knew there was a problem. There should at minimum be a temperature alarm in the "computer room."

After complaining about the difference between common sense and what building simulation programs recommend, I was told this disconnect is due to "standard ASHRAE methodology" and not a flaw in any particular building simulation tool. I feel it's time for the heating and cooling profession to catch up with the reality of current "computer rooms."

This is just my two cents; what do other people think?

Hello all,

 

Does anyone know of a definitive list outlining whole building
simulation tools capable of interfacing with integrated environments
(for example, IFC, gbXML, etc.)? I am primarily interested in the
ability to import geometry from CAD tools. 

 

Kind regards

The only list I know of is http://www.bauwesen.fh-muenchen.de/iai/ImplementationOverview.htm which lists all IFC compliant applications.  It hasn't been updated since Jan. 2003 and only lists 2 pograms: (1) BSClient for EnergyPlus and (2) RUISKA, BSPro from Olof Granlund Oy.

Otherwise, http://www.aecbytes.com/viewpoint/2005/issue_12.html has an article by Dominic Gallello (President & CEO, Graphisoft) which describes 3 other programs (including Ecotect).

Subject: [bldg-sim] electricity generation from waste heat
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200605090954.AA5456953pd80001082155@gard.com>

I am looking for waste heat generation equipment to use the exhaust from a
30 kW Capstone microturbine and turn this is into additional electricity.
Exhaust is at 530 deg. F, and operation will vary so that exhaust heat may
be from 30,000 to 300,000 Btu/hr.  Some of the heat will be used for heating
and DHW. 

 

I am aware of a thermal electric generator solid state device, but it needs
higher temperatures.  I am also aware of the Electra Therm which uses a
refrigerant cycle with a generation device at the expansion valve but the
smallest unit they are building now is much too big.  

 

Anyone know of a really small steam generator, or other method to create
useful electricity from such a heat source?

 

Thanks

 

Brian

The R-value database they have created is a really good resource.  
 
Another good source is ASHRAE's "Heat Tramission Coefficients for Walls,

	Hi all,

	Does anyone know of any good values/research to use for derating
the R-value of batt insulation in a (residential) wall stud cavity as it
settles over time?  I've heard recently that an R-19 can often perform
around R-13, and would like to find a second source.

Objet : [bldg-sim] Simulation tools capable of interfacing with integrated environments
 
Elmer,

I don't know of any available references. But based on my experience, 
Ecotect is quite good for importing and exporting 3D building cad model 
for building simulation.

I am also interested to hear more about this issue, especially on IFC 
and gbXML. A ambitious project I know of in Singapore tried to implement 
building code checking through IFC, but failed because IFC is not 
capable to recognize everything required by the building code yet and 
the project die a natural death after spend a few millions by their 
government.

Anybody have any indication of the market support for IFC or gbXML?


Kind regards,

CK

Don't know. 

I've read about laboratory results, but I don't know what the issues are bringing this to mass production. A wild guess would be 5 to 10 years. The PV folks at NREL should know more about this.

This sounds interesting - how long before we might see these (in your 
estimation, or anyone else on the list)? Web search did not turn up much 
information on them.

Thanks,

In heating dominated climates, you find that the heating energy can 
increase far outweighing the PV energy generated.

A couple of good points in your colorful email. 

Yes. We have a thesis on PV/T as well, (Sakara Rasisuttra) including test bench data of a triple effect PV/T panel (electric, solar heating, and night-time radiant cooling). 

Unfortunately, the data show that you're better off not to combine things since this would mean an unglazed collector that is not very good at collecting useful heat when it gets cold, or at radiating heat at night. Furthermore, you need enormous area, even at near horizontal orientation covering a roof, which gets worse is the BIPV has a vertical orientation, that is off-south.  

You're better off with high efficiency components that do one thing well. Furthermore, you may need special-purpose, cascade systems to squeeze the Btus out of the thermal stream before returning to the collector. 

I myself am looking forward to the multi-spectral systems going into production. The expected 30 - 40 % efficiency will turn the tide for PV.

I certainly agree with Pat?s statement that ?most engineers have a difficult
time even estimating what the price of energy will be 15 years from now, or
5 for that matter?.  I would expand this to fit the more general case:

 

1.	It is difficult for anyone to predict the future cost of energy.
2.	The effort required to calculate energy savings can range from
relatively simple to complicated, depending on the technology being
evaluated and the analysis procedure required.  But, given enough effort,
one can usually get a pretty good handle on the energy savings.
3.	Doing a life-cycle analysis on those savings to determine
present-value $$$ savings is a lot like pushing a rope ? the longer the
analysis period (or rope), the more difficult it is to predict the outcome.
4.	The errors in the life cycle assumptions of energy escalation rate,
etc., when extrapolated out 20 years or more, can dwarf the errors in the
calculation procedure used to calculate the annual energy savings.
5.	Given #3, a life-cycle analysis can actually confuse the issue,
rather than clarify it.  (Hence the original question posted on this
subject.)

 

For these reasons, I question the validity of life-cycle analysis.  Since
the goal of most life-cycle analysis is to compute a discounted payback, and
most financial decision makers then arbitrarily select a maximum limit on
payback, which is typically much less than 20 years, why not just use simple
payback?

The escalation assumptions that come from the Energy Information
Administration are, as Renee stated, negative for many years, and from our
perspective very conservative.  I think that people use the EIA numbers
because most engineers have a difficult time even estimating what the price
of energy will be 15 years from now, or 5 for that matter.

 

We have done a little research to try and find escalation factors that agree
more closely with recent experience.  For California have been using 2%
based on a look back at utility rates.  The difficulty is that EIA never
projects discontinuities (they can't), but a lot of the increases over the
past 30 years have been in the form of spikes.  For example, next year the
price of natural gas may drop, but it will drop from historic highs which
were not captured by any escalation assumptions in the recent past.

 

I would be curious to know if any large corporate entities have an energy
cost assumption built into their corporate budgeting process.  I have to
believe that energy intensive industries, certainly the airlines, and
probably others have economists or consultants dedicated to assessing this
issue/risk.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] life cycle costing assumptions for non-federal projects

I was using BLCC for life cycle costing and the end life cycle cost results
were less than if I took the maintenance costs, energy costs, and first
costs and added them together over the 25 year study period I was examining!
Then I noticed the NIST/DOE fuel escalation factors which have negative
values for many of the years. This I believe contributed to this error. My
first question is, doesn?t this seem odd that the fuel escalation factors
are negative at a time like now?

 

Also, as this was a non-federal project, I used a default factor of 2%
instead. But my other questions are, for life cycle costing analysis, what
are the most commonly used sources you might have found for inflation rates,
real or nominal discount rates, or fuel escalation rates? I made some
assumptions based on doing some web research but is there an acceptable
method of choice other than using defaults in BLCC which are designed more
for federal projects?

 

Thanks in advance for your feedback!

Back in the early 90's when I worked on the building energy standard for Mexico, I looked into the availability of weather data. The best I could come up was 3 years of data each for 5 locations, of which the closest to Torreon is Monterrey, roughly 300 km to the east. No doubt if you were to contact the US National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) now, you should be able to get many more years of data, but again probably just for Monterrey. However, I did find fairly complete monthly statistics including daily max/mins, humidity, minutes of sunshine, etc., for over 60 cities, one of which, if my memory's correct, was Torreon. At one point I was intrigued by the possibility of developing hourly data from such monthly statistics, but never had the time or drive to look into it carefully.  Larry Degelman, however, has written a program that does this, although his program will require a few other items of input.  So, your choices are to either use Monterrey data (hopefully do a better job than I did with more years of record), or experiment in creating a weather file for Torreon from the monthly statistics.

  Greetings,

  I am looking for weather data for Torreon, Mexico (pretty remote, I know!). I would be grateful if someone can guide me to where I might find it or something close to it. What other options do I have if nothing is available for this location?

  Thanks,

Meteonorm is a last resort if you can't find something
closer.  It essentially will interpolate between whatever
locations it has in its dataset--which can be really spotty
in some places.

Greetings,
I am looking for weather data for Torreon, Mexico (pretty remote, I know!).
I would be grateful if someone can guide me to where I might find it or
something close to it. What other options do I have if nothing is available
for this location?
Thanks,
~m

Extending on Ramana's comment,
Toggle between the project-site, Internal
loads,airside HVAC, waterside, hVAC tabs a few times
and come back to the building geometry tab and then "
right click on the screen and click on reset camera".
That should work.

Mark:

Check your computer memory. I have 256Meg memory at
home, and I cannot see 3-D on some eQUEST files that I
can with the 1 GIG memory at work.

You may have crossed into the "Twilight Zone" when you
added somthing.

Hey marke,

Toggle between the project-site, Internal loads, airside HVAC, waterside
HVAC tabs a few times and come back to the building geometry tab and then
try to view the 3D geometry. That should work most of the times. Been there
done that.

EXTENDED ABSTRACT DEADLINE

Call for Presentations

for Seminar at

ASHRAE Meeting Dallas, Texas, January 27-31, 2007

 

Seminar title

Use of 'equation solver' for modeling and simulation

 

Co-chairs

Prof. Jean Lebrun, University of Liege
J.Lebrun at ulg.ac.be <mailto:J.Lebrun at ulg.ac.be> 

 

Michael Wetter, United Technologies Research Center
WetterM at utrc.utc.com <mailto:WetterM at utrc.utc.com>  

 

We are looking for three to four speakers for a 90 minute seminar to be
held at the ASHRAE meeting in Dallas. Please, see below for the seminar
abstract and deadlines. For questions, please feel free to contact Prof.
Jean Lebrun and Michael Wetter.


Abstract


 

This seminar shall show how simulation packages that are built using
equation-based solvers can benefit the building energy community. Such
software packages typically separate the formulation of a model's
underlying physics from its numerical solution algorithms. This allows
input-output free modeling, which facilitates model reuse and the
selection of the numerical solution algorithm that is best suited for
the problem at hand. Equation-based simulation packages are frequently
used in various industrial sectors. In building energy simulation,
however, they have not yet enjoyed wide-spread use. Based on a
technology assessment and case-studies, this seminar shall stimulate
discussions to understand their applicability, advantages and
limitations for the building energy community.

 


Deadlines


May 15, 2006: Extended Deadline for Submission of 100-200 word abstract
to WetterM at utrc.utc.com

June 1, 2006: Notification of acceptance.

July 1, 2006: Submission of presentation slides.

Mike,
 
(I think) The XL sheet that you are referring to is a reference sheet.
It references window glass types in the DOE2 glass library. By changing
the values in the sheet, you will not change anything in your model.
What it's intended use is is for you to be able to look up glazing type
numbers from the glass library so that you can pick glass types by u
value, Tviz & SHGC.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Window Inputs


Hello all,
 
Can someone explain to me how I can change the values associated with
windows. I am aware of the Excel sheet that has the window parameters in
it, but I do not think that the software goes to this file for the info
because there are multiple sheets that have the values sorted by
different qualities. If I change a value in one of the sheets it is not
automatically reflected in the other sheets, this is why I do not think
the software is going to the Excel file for the info (which sheet would
it go to). I also made changes to the Excel sheet and they did not seem
to be reflected in the simulation output.
 
Thanks and sorry if this request is not clear,
 
Mike d
