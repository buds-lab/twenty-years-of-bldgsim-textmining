True, but when you define your wall assembly you define your external surface reflectance which then factors in the solar absorptance.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] "Opaque" windows

Strictly speaking, every construction (window or wall) has a non-zero SHGC. A portion of absorbed solar radiation will ultimately end up inside a space (via conduction through the surface and later radiation/convection into the space). A highly insulated wall will transmit a negligible amount of energy. The ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals (Fenestration chapter) provides a method for calculating the SHGC of window frames.

For your opaque windows, the transmittance may be zero, but the SHGC > 0. The magnitude will depend on the construction of the "window"; with higher U-values leading to a higher SHGC.

Why not use LBNL Window software to calculate it? I ran the following tests with opaque glass and clear glass. Here are the results:
Plain opaque glass: SHGC = 0.31
Opaque outside, air, Clear inside: SHGC = 0.16
Clear outside, air, Opaque inside: SHGC = 0.5

It depends which surface is black........  S1 (outside) clear >>>  normal reflected / transmitted fractions....etc.

Hi Robert,

If it's an opaque window, can't it be described as a construction/wall material? Why still define it as a window?

Does anybody know a SHGC for "Opaque" windows?  I think they painted
them black.

I don't think "0.00" is appropriate, but I'm willing to listen to reason...

model.  I am not looking for review of the building elements (although 
comments are welcome) but I need someone who owns and uses Energy Pro 
routinely for NR Performance energy usage, rates, energy costs, and load

water-cooled condenser (open cooling tower), hot water boiler, hot water 
pump, cooling tower pump and fan, 70 Ton DX 25,000 CFM air side, 32 VAV 
boxes (typ. 30%), hot water reheat coils in VAV boxes, and other 
elements.  I will send you the .bld file for review, so you must have 
the EP NR Performance module.

This is not for T-24 compliance, but rather for energy savings estimates 
with modifications and alternatives.

If you have experience with such systems and have two hours available 
today or over the weekend, please call the number below or reply to 
robert at wichert.org <mailto:robert at wichert.org> .  I will pay your rate

Hi, all,

I'm from the high performance group in Gatech led by Prof. Augenbroe and I
have a question about the E+ Version7 new feature which uses CEN adaptive
comfort model for NV control.

I have investigated within E+ and confirmed with E+ support team that in
airflow network scheme, if we use the CEN adaptive comfort model for NV
control, the program is intentionally looking for a temperature set-point
schedule and the documentation is lagging to explain this.

So my question is: If I use airflow net work model with CEN adaptive
comfort model for NV control in E+, what kind of * temperature set-point
schedule *should I define for this?* *Or what is the right way of using
this new feature in E+?

It would be really helpful if anyone could help me on this, thanks very
much!

Best,

Qinpeng

Hi all,

We are modeling a new construction hospital whose cooling loads are met by 3 onsite 1350 ton chillers. A fourth 'future' 1350 ton chiller is added to this plant to provide supplementary cooling to an adjacent but future Lab building (the lab also borrows partial cooling from a campus CHW loop). All four chillers will be connected to the same primary chilled water loop, so essentially both the hospital and lab will feed off the same CHW loop. However, the hospital and Lab are being certified as two separate LEED NC projects.

For modeling the hospital only, should I

1.       Create  a virtual plant using Appendix C of the LEED DES guidelines and --model all upstream equipment, add a process load profile of the hospital and the lab to determine the average COP of the plant and then apply it to the hospital;

2.       OR make an argument that we should be allowed to scale the plant as per the loads of the hospital since the plant is onsite. This will mean that, I will model the hospital as having only 3 onsite chillers and all related upstream equipment without following the LEED DES guidelines.

Any input will be appreciated.

Thank you

I would follow #2

You need to figure out what the chiller sequencing is and factor that into your model too, but there is no reason why you shouldn't model it as an on site chiller. When the lab comes online and if they seek to certify the lab, then I guess the lab would need to follow option1.

I agree on this point if there is only one building of the hospital.
If there is more than one buildings in the hospital, I will choose option 1 I think.

Dear All

I have been involved in modeling PCM as a part of my PhD work at University of Colorado Boulder. At this phase of my work, I'm looking for a reliable experimental data to validate the models that I have coded. If you are willing to share your experimental data or you know someone who has one, then I will appreciate you contacting me or send the data to me. 


I have done the literature and found many available studies and contacting authors but unfortunately wasn't successful in getting the data. I tried to extract data from those published papers but I don't think that would be accurate for validation(i.e. may be good for qualitative comparison) .


I appreciate your cooperation for accurate PCM simulation.

I am compiling a list of published Building Energy Modeling Guidelines. I
know of a few and was hoping to get some help from all of you to fill it
out. This is what I know of:

*1) CIBSE Applications Manual AM11: 1998, Building Energy and Environmental
Modelling*. The manual is available to members of the United Kingdom
organization - the Chartered Institution of Building Services (CIBSE).

2) From the Colorado Governor's Energy Office, ENERGY MODELING: A GUIDE FOR
THE BUILDING PROFESSIONAL. See
http://rechargecolorado.org/images/uploads/pdfs/Energy_Modelling_062411.pdf

3) AIA Modeling Guidelines (believe there is a draft out for public review)

Ashrae 90.1 isn't a guideline? Its a set of massively prescriptive and defined rules for assessing buildings against benchmark buildings. 

We have a similar document to some extent in the UK. The national calculation methodology document that accompanies the iSBEM energy calculation tool available from the BRE outlines how to model in accordance with UK regulations or at least it does to some extent. 

Ok whilst writing this I've altered my opinions and so both are probably worth adding to list as they do have  some useful information on how to define zones, etc rather than just being code style documents.

Kind regards

Paul

Ellen,



Here's a few more:



1. In a way the sample files that come with DOE-2.1e are showing you examples of buildings that LBNL assembled to go with DOE-2. You can view these with DrawBDL. However, there is only limited text that explains he intent of the file, and now guideline so to speak about modeling a building, in general.



In a similar fashion, EQUEST comes with input files that you can view as well that pretty much cover the full range of building types.



Finally, the DOE EnergyPlus standard 17 building type files (that came originally from Joe Huang I'm told) are also examples of how to model different building types.



There are also the books by Joe Clarke, Godfried Augenbroe, Jan Hensen/Roberto Lambert on simulation that provide varying advice on simulation.



Also, TRNSYS has lots of files in their library that show how to model different things (mostly systems), that are useful as well.



Problem is with any guide, anywhere is that, at some point,  is has to be specific to a particular simulation program, or else it becomes so general that it loses it meaning.



If you want something that is really interesting, look at the 1958 ASHRAE paper by Buchberg that talks about modeling a one room hut using an analog electrical circuit...this was the start of it all.

Saleh,

My latest data on the BioPCM technology is attached in the document called
BioPCM Energy Plus Objects. It has temperature enthalpy sets for the
following melt temperatures: Q21, Q23, Q25, Q29.
I do not yet have data on the microtek, BASF, and DuPont products, but the
microtek is not commercially available yet, and the BASF & DuPont products
can not be installed in the USA because they are a fire hazard so the
BioPCM is the defacto only commercially viable product for the USA. I have
attached a file with info on the BioPCM technology as well as an image of
the BioPCMat product..

The ramp on the Q21 is .5C/min, and the others are 1C/min, all using
dynamic DSC testing.  I have requested for each of the melt temps to be
tested using isothermal stepped DSC testing. Question-- Could/would you
want to do T history and/or isothermal stepped testing, if so I can have
samples of each sent to you on Monday, as the lab I have at my disposal is
saying that it may take 250 hours to do the isothermal stepped tests, and
my math says that it should take more like 20 hours (how long would you say
it should take?) I have also attached are three files on testing methods
for your review..

Also thank you for all the recent advise, I now have my model working for a
small room and did figure out how to get energy savings. What I did was use
the internal source sink layers construction object and change the
convergence limits and it now works very well.

Here is a link to my visualization of a recent simulation run for Denver CO
that shows 25.2% savings (The same file ran in Eugene Oregon shows 12.6%)

   -
   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ag7cD5ZV9QwRdGdmMThETElEaGJNWUQ3ZGU1MEZRcEE


Lastly I have attached two files that I found to be very interesting with
regards to parametric modeling PCM's, one by Saylor on enhanced comfort in
passive house and the other on an office building and more.. (see pages
50+)
I figure these files may give you some ideas about possible parametric
analysis that might be done.

Best of luck on your code project, and I will send you the next data as
soon as I get it (hot of the DSC....:)

Ellen,
Perhaps the Bonneville Power "Guildelines for Energy Simulation of
Commercial Buildings"?  It's old, but perhaps still useful?

Jeff,

1) Is it correct to say that any problem discussed on this list can be
answered by referring to some of sources that were just mentioned?

2) More general.. Can you give an estimate on how many professionals in BEM
community (ten, hundred, thousand) are, let's say, 100% educated,
'self-sufficient', capable of demonstrating the ultimate level of knowledge?

3) More specifically.. From your experience, what is an average percentage
of  graduates from your school  who becomes an expert in BEM?

4) More on this... How many BEM schools are there in US? Can you name them?


Thank you,

Pavel Dybskiy

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Building Energy Modeling Guidelines

Jeff,

1) Is it correct to say that any problem discussed on this list can be answered by referring to some of sources that were just mentioned?

I have always found that the sample files that come with DOE-2 and EQUEST provide advise on how to model 90% of most buildings. The 10% would include things that can't be modeled well with DOE-2 and/or EQUEST including: atriums, borrowed-lite windows (i.e., glass on an inside partition), courtyard buildings with interior gardens (i.e., evaporative cooling that leads to different temps in the courtyard -- see John Reynolds book). If one adds the 17 DOE EnergyPlus files, then you could make that 95%.

2) More general.. Can you give an estimate on how many professionals in BEM community (ten, hundred, thousand) are, let's say, 100% educated, 'self-sufficient', capable of demonstrating the ultimate level of knowledge?

Whew! I think there are about 100+ or so ASHRAE Certified BEM modelers...which grows every month. Conservatively, if you doubled or tripled that number to include good modelers that have not taken the exam, then you might have a few hundred folks that are certified or equivalent.

If you want to know those who are capable of demonstrating the ultimate knowledge, you'd have to be code-specific, and then I would guess there are probably less than 20 persons per code or less that really know what they are doing well enought to write rewrite the code (i.e., DOE-2), or edit the FORTRAN and recompile the code. Unfortunately, many of the folks who wrote the original algorithms for DOE-2 and BLAST (a part of EnergyPlus) are no longer around.

In the case of EnergyPlus, I would guess there are maybe 20 people that really know the code well enough to edit it and/or write new modules. Obviously, those who worked on it, and a few more, that's about it.

For TRNSYS, the number is probably smaller. In the U.S. the source of most knowledge about TRNSYS is in Wisconsin (i.e., TESS or UofW-M).

3) More specifically.. From your experience, what is an average percentage of  graduates from your school  who becomes an expert in BEM?

I've always believed that it takes about 10 years of constant use to become expert. I educate about 10 to 20 persons per year, and have done so for 27 years. So, about 1/2 of my students may or may not have been praticing for 10 years, which brings them into the realm of becoming expert. Our current staff at the ESL who work on our code-compliant web-based calculator are all expert level (...they now teach me!).
4) More on this... How many BEM schools are there in US?

I'm sure I'll insult someone here...

Can you name them?
I can name schools where I know folks: MIT, PSU, TAMU, UT, OSU, CU, UC Berkeley, UofI, ASU, UofW-Milwaukee, UofW-Madison, UofW-Milwaukee, Purdue,UPenn, Cornell, CUNY, U.Kansas...and others.

Ellen,



Here's a few more:



1. In a way the sample files that come with DOE-2.1e are showing you examples of buildings that LBNL assembled to go with DOE-2. You can view these with DrawBDL. However, there is only limited text that explains he intent of the file, and now guideline so to speak about modeling a building, in general.



In a similar fashion, EQUEST comes with input files that you can view as well that pretty much cover the full range of building types.



Finally, the DOE EnergyPlus standard 17 building type files (that came originally from Joe Huang I'm told) are also examples of how to model different building types.



There are also the books by Joe Clarke, Godfried Augenbroe, Jan Hensen/Roberto Lambert on simulation that provide varying advice on simulation.



Also, TRNSYS has lots of files in their library that show how to model different things (mostly systems), that are useful as well.



Problem is with any guide, anywhere is that, at some point,  is has to be specific to a particular simulation program, or else it becomes so general that it loses it meaning.



If you want something that is really interesting, look at the 1958 ASHRAE paper by Buchberg that talks about modeling a one room hut using an analog electrical circuit...this was the start of it all.

Ashrae 90.1 isn't a guideline? Its a set of massively prescriptive and defined rules for assessing buildings against benchmark buildings.

We have a similar document to some extent in the UK. The national calculation methodology document that accompanies the iSBEM energy calculation tool available from the BRE outlines how to model in accordance with UK regulations or at least it does to some extent.

Ok whilst writing this I've altered my opinions and so both are probably worth adding to list as they do have  some useful information on how to define zones, etc rather than just being code style documents.

I think modeling is one thing, and understanding the causes and results when modeling is something else. It is like the X-ray technician and the doctor who look at the X-ray image to interpret it. Yes, we need professional modeler, but we also need building technology experts who can derive meaningful information from the energy model to evaluate and improve the design. Otherwise , it will be shooting in the dark.

2) From the Colorado Governor's Energy Office, ENERGY MODELING: A GUIDE FOR THE BUILDING PROFESSIONAL. See http://rechargecolorado.org/images/uploads/pdfs/Energy_Modelling_062411.pdf 

3) AIA Modeling Guidelines (believe there is a draft out for public review) but what I find on their website is: 
An Architects Guide to Integrated Modeling Within the Design Process 

4) GSA BIM to BEM also out for public review,see: http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/105075 

5) ASHRAE Research Project 1468 BIM to BEM, 

What have others come across?

Good analogy in case ... if the modeler's job is to run a model developed
by an expert, and only change weather files and sometimes windows' size and
temperature set point :)

It appears that EQuest will not import EnergyPro .bld files.  Am I 
correct?  Is there any way to import an EnergyPro .bld file into EQuest?

It seems not, but if anybody will know, somebody on this list will know, 
so I'm asking.


Thanks for your thoughts.

One of the better handbooks which cover all aspects of professional use
of simulation software is the CIBSE AM-11.  Checklists, data sources, discussions
of methodology and not specific to any particular software.  And AM-11
is currently being updated so there should be a new version out in the mid-term.

Regarding documentation and guides focused on code compliance such
as the earlier reference to SBEM in the UK:  Compliance is a sub-set
goal for the use of simulation -  focused on comparison with a specific
set of rules.  These rules are not necessarily well matched if the purpose
of simulation is to enquire about how a design actually works.  

Many practitioners have become confused over time about the differences
between models defined for purposes of compliance and design.  Using a
compliance tool and compliance rule set for design is a decision which
may constrain your deliverables. 

Much of what we can observe in a building and measure via simulation 
does not fit in a compliance rule-set.  Goals differ.  The extents of the
underlying physics which apply differ.  Check out what has to be
stripped-out of an otherwise well-formed design model to confirm with 
compliance rule sets.  Mass flow networks no, CFD no way, explicit
representations of raised floors, ceiling voids, buffer spaces and
explicit mass within rooms are a few of the issues which are not 
discussed or forbidden.

Gentelmen,
As a self educated Modeler, who takes the task very seriously I might add,
I encourage you to read the publication by the rocky mountain institute on
what they call "Black Belt Energy Modeling".. And see how you feel you rank
in the system. (I would say I am a purple belt)

Check this link
http://www.rmi.org/Content/Files/Black%20Belt%20Modeling%20Matrix%20RMI%2008-27-10.pdf

Or see attachment for the full pdf,

Black Belt Energy Modeling1
The concept of black belt energy modeling arose from a need to set forth
expectations, training materials, and professional development paths for
learning
this specialized skill. While contributions can be made at many levels,
becoming a
master requires a depth and breadth of knowledge pertaining to engineering,
building science and energy simulation tools. The Black Belt Energy Modeling
Matrix presented below outlines a spectrum of modeling capabilities ? from
trainee
to master ? along with the associated skills and background knowledge to
support
success.
The framework and content of the matrix are based on providing integrated
design
assistance as typically delivered to the private sector. Thus the outline
may not align
well to other applications. It does not reflect the benefits of a
streamlined BIM
process or software that automatically generates a minimally code?compliant
building model.

Gentelmen, 

As a self educated Modeler, who takes the task very seriously I might add, I encourage you to read the publication by the rocky mountain institute on what they call "Black Belt Energy Modeling".. And see how you feel you rank in the system. (I would say I am a purple belt) 

 

Check this link http://www.rmi.org/Content/Files/Black%20Belt%20Modeling%20Matrix%20RMI%2008-27-10.pdf

 

Or see attachment for the full pdf,

 

Black Belt Energy Modeling1

The concept of black belt energy modeling arose from a need to set forth

expectations, training materials, and professional development paths for learning

this specialized skill. While contributions can be made at many levels, becoming a

master requires a depth and breadth of knowledge pertaining to engineering,

building science and energy simulation tools. The Black Belt Energy Modeling

Matrix presented below outlines a spectrum of modeling capabilities ? from trainee

to master ? along with the associated skills and background knowledge to support

success.

The framework and content of the matrix are based on providing integrated design

assistance as typically delivered to the private sector. Thus the outline may not align

well to other applications. It does not reflect the benefits of a streamlined BIM

process or software that automatically generates a minimally code?compliant

building model.

Jeff, 

 

1) Is it correct to say that any problem discussed on this list can be answered by referring to some of sources that were just mentioned?

 

I have always found that the sample files that come with DOE-2 and EQUEST provide advise on how to model 90% of most buildings. The 10% would include things that can't be modeled well with DOE-2 and/or EQUEST including: atriums, borrowed-lite windows (i.e., glass on an inside partition), courtyard buildings with interior gardens (i.e., evaporative cooling that leads to different temps in the courtyard -- see John Reynolds book). If one adds the 17 DOE EnergyPlus files, then you could make that 95%.

 

2) More general.. Can you give an estimate on how many professionals in BEM community (ten, hundred, thousand) are, let's say, 100% educated, 'self-sufficient', capable of demonstrating the ultimate level of knowledge?

 

Whew! I think there are about 100+ or so ASHRAE Certified BEM modelers...which grows every month. Conservatively, if you doubled or tripled that number to include good modelers that have not taken the exam, then you might have a few hundred folks that are certified or equivalent.

 

If you want to know those who are capable of demonstrating the ultimate knowledge, you'd have to be code-specific, and then I would guess there are probably less than 20 persons per code or less that really know what they are doing well enought to write rewrite the code (i.e., DOE-2), or edit the FORTRAN and recompile the code. Unfortunately, many of the folks who wrote the original algorithms for DOE-2 and BLAST (a part of EnergyPlus) are no longer around.

 

In the case of EnergyPlus, I would guess there are maybe 20 people that really know the code well enough to edit it and/or write new modules. Obviously, those who worked on it, and a few more, that's about it.

 

For TRNSYS, the number is probably smaller. In the U.S. the source of most knowledge about TRNSYS is in Wisconsin (i.e., TESS or UofW-M).

 

3) More specifically.. From your experience, what is an average percentage of  graduates from your school  who becomes an expert in BEM? 

 

I've always believed that it takes about 10 years of constant use to become expert. I educate about 10 to 20 persons per year, and have done so for 27 years. So, about 1/2 of my students may or may not have been praticing for 10 years, which brings them into the realm of becoming expert. Our current staff at the ESL who work on our code-compliant web-based calculator are all expert level (...they now teach me!).

4) More on this... How many BEM schools are there in US? 

 

I'm sure I'll insult someone here...

 

Can you name them?    

I can name schools where I know folks: MIT, PSU, TAMU, UT, OSU, CU, UC Berkeley, UofI, ASU, UofW-Milwaukee, UofW-Madison, UofW-Milwaukee, Purdue,UPenn, Cornell, CUNY, U.Kansas...and others.

Thank you,

Ellen,

 

Here's a few more:

 

1. In a way the sample files that come with DOE-2.1e are showing you examples of buildings that LBNL assembled to go with DOE-2. You can view these with DrawBDL. However, there is only limited text that explains he intent of the file, and now guideline so to speak about modeling a building, in general.

 

In a similar fashion, EQUEST comes with input files that you can view as well that pretty much cover the full range of building types.

 

Finally, the DOE EnergyPlus standard 17 building type files (that came originally from Joe Huang I'm told) are also examples of how to model different building types. 

 

There are also the books by Joe Clarke, Godfried Augenbroe, Jan Hensen/Roberto Lambert on simulation that provide varying advice on simulation.

 

Also, TRNSYS has lots of files in their library that show how to model different things (mostly systems), that are useful as well.

 

Problem is with any guide, anywhere is that, at some point,  is has to be specific to a particular simulation program, or else it becomes so general that it loses it meaning.

 

If you want something that is really interesting, look at the 1958 ASHRAE paper by Buchberg that talks about modeling a one room hut using an analog electrical circuit...this was the start of it all.

Ashrae 90.1 isn't a guideline? Its a set of massively prescriptive and defined rules for assessing buildings against benchmark buildings. 

We have a similar document to some extent in the UK. The national calculation methodology document that accompanies the iSBEM energy calculation tool available from the BRE outlines how to model in accordance with UK regulations or at least it does to some extent. 

Ok whilst writing this I've altered my opinions and so both are probably worth adding to list as they do have  some useful information on how to define zones, etc rather than just being code style documents.

Kind regards

Paul

Of course ASHRAE 90.1 APPENDIX G is the most popular guideline I think

Hi, Ellen.

There are two simulation guidelines (Volume 1 and 2) at Energy Design
Resources:

http://energydesignresources.com/resources/publications/design-guidelines/design-guidelines-hvac-simulation-guidelines.aspx

http://energydesignresources.com/resources/publications/design-guidelines/design-guidelines-advanced-simulation-guidebook,-volume-ii.aspx


And the Advanced VAV Design Guide at EDR has guidance on modeling fans,
DCV, and VAV boxes.

There's also a 1992 guide from BPA that Jason Glazer posted awhile back:

Gentelmen,
As a self educated Modeler, who takes the task very seriously I might add, I encourage you to read the publication by the rocky mountain institute on what they call "Black Belt Energy Modeling".. And see how you feel you rank in the system. (I would say I am a purple belt)

Check this link http://www.rmi.org/Content/Files/Black%20Belt%20Modeling%20Matrix%20RMI%2008-27-10.pdf

Or see attachment for the full pdf,

Black Belt Energy Modeling1
The concept of black belt energy modeling arose from a need to set forth
expectations, training materials, and professional development paths for learning
this specialized skill. While contributions can be made at many levels, becoming a
master requires a depth and breadth of knowledge pertaining to engineering,
building science and energy simulation tools. The Black Belt Energy Modeling
Matrix presented below outlines a spectrum of modeling capabilities ? from trainee
to master ? along with the associated skills and background knowledge to support
success.
The framework and content of the matrix are based on providing integrated design
assistance as typically delivered to the private sector. Thus the outline may not align
well to other applications. It does not reflect the benefits of a streamlined BIM
process or software that automatically generates a minimally code?compliant
building model.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Building Energy Modeling Guidelines
Jeff,

1) Is it correct to say that any problem discussed on this list can be answered by referring to some of sources that were just mentioned?

I have always found that the sample files that come with DOE-2 and EQUEST provide advise on how to model 90% of most buildings. The 10% would include things that can't be modeled well with DOE-2 and/or EQUEST including: atriums, borrowed-lite windows (i.e., glass on an inside partition), courtyard buildings with interior gardens (i.e., evaporative cooling that leads to different temps in the courtyard -- see John Reynolds book). If one adds the 17 DOE EnergyPlus files, then you could make that 95%.

2) More general.. Can you give an estimate on how many professionals in BEM community (ten, hundred, thousand) are, let's say, 100% educated, 'self-sufficient', capable of demonstrating the ultimate level of knowledge?

Whew! I think there are about 100+ or so ASHRAE Certified BEM modelers...which grows every month. Conservatively, if you doubled or tripled that number to include good modelers that have not taken the exam, then you might have a few hundred folks that are certified or equivalent.

If you want to know those who are capable of demonstrating the ultimate knowledge, you'd have to be code-specific, and then I would guess there are probably less than 20 persons per code or less that really know what they are doing well enought to write rewrite the code (i.e., DOE-2), or edit the FORTRAN and recompile the code. Unfortunately, many of the folks who wrote the original algorithms for DOE-2 and BLAST (a part of EnergyPlus) are no longer around.

In the case of EnergyPlus, I would guess there are maybe 20 people that really know the code well enough to edit it and/or write new modules. Obviously, those who worked on it, and a few more, that's about it.

For TRNSYS, the number is probably smaller. In the U.S. the source of most knowledge about TRNSYS is in Wisconsin (i.e., TESS or UofW-M).

3) More specifically.. From your experience, what is an average percentage of  graduates from your school  who becomes an expert in BEM?

I've always believed that it takes about 10 years of constant use to become expert. I educate about 10 to 20 persons per year, and have done so for 27 years. So, about 1/2 of my students may or may not have been praticing for 10 years, which brings them into the realm of becoming expert. Our current staff at the ESL who work on our code-compliant web-based calculator are all expert level (...they now teach me!).
4) More on this... How many BEM schools are there in US?

I'm sure I'll insult someone here...

Can you name them?
I can name schools where I know folks: MIT, PSU, TAMU, UT, OSU, CU, UC Berkeley, UofI, ASU, UofW-Milwaukee, UofW-Madison, UofW-Milwaukee, Purdue,UPenn, Cornell, CUNY, U.Kansas...and others.

Thank you,

Ellen,



Here's a few more:



1. In a way the sample files that come with DOE-2.1e are showing you examples of buildings that LBNL assembled to go with DOE-2. You can view these with DrawBDL. However, there is only limited text that explains he intent of the file, and now guideline so to speak about modeling a building, in general.



In a similar fashion, EQUEST comes with input files that you can view as well that pretty much cover the full range of building types.



Finally, the DOE EnergyPlus standard 17 building type files (that came originally from Joe Huang I'm told) are also examples of how to model different building types.



There are also the books by Joe Clarke, Godfried Augenbroe, Jan Hensen/Roberto Lambert on simulation that provide varying advice on simulation.



Also, TRNSYS has lots of files in their library that show how to model different things (mostly systems), that are useful as well.



Problem is with any guide, anywhere is that, at some point,  is has to be specific to a particular simulation program, or else it becomes so general that it loses it meaning.



If you want something that is really interesting, look at the 1958 ASHRAE paper by Buchberg that talks about modeling a one room hut using an analog electrical circuit...this was the start of it all.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Building Energy Modeling Guidelines
Ashrae 90.1 isn't a guideline? Its a set of massively prescriptive and defined rules for assessing buildings against benchmark buildings.

We have a similar document to some extent in the UK. The national calculation methodology document that accompanies the iSBEM energy calculation tool available from the BRE outlines how to model in accordance with UK regulations or at least it does to some extent.

Ok whilst writing this I've altered my opinions and so both are probably worth adding to list as they do have  some useful information on how to define zones, etc rather than just being code style documents.

Kind regards

Paul

Of course ASHRAE 90.1 APPENDIX G is the most popular guideline I think

1) CIBSE Applications Manual AM11: 1998, Building Energy and Environmental Modelling. The manual is available to members of the United Kingdom organization - the Chartered Institution of Building Services (CIBSE).

2) From the Colorado Governor's Energy Office, ENERGY MODELING: A GUIDE FOR THE BUILDING PROFESSIONAL. See http://rechargecolorado.org/images/uploads/pdfs/Energy_Modelling_062411.pdf

3) AIA Modeling Guidelines (believe there is a draft out for public review) but what I find on their website is:
An Architects Guide to Integrated Modeling Within the Design Process

4) GSA BIM to BEM also out for public review,see: http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/105075

5) ASHRAE Research Project 1468 BIM to BEM,

What have others come across?

Energy Star's Multifamily High-Rise program 
<http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=bldrs_lenders_raters.nh_mfhr_tech_res> 
has published a set of multifamily simulation guidelines, which can be 
found here 
<http://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/bldrs_lenders_raters/downloads/mfhr/ENERGY_STAR_MFHR_Simulation_Guidelines_V1.0.pdf?d8d0-351e>.  
These are also referenced by the LEED for Homes Multifamily Midrise 
program.  Older versions of the simulation guidelines included a nice 
appendix that include references and background for many of the proposed 
guidelines.

Interesting comments,
Any reviews on the recently released IBPSA's first book : "Building
Performance Simulation for Design and Operation Edited by Jan L.M.
Hensen, Roberto Lamberts" ?

Thanks,

Santiago.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Hot Water ReHeat in DOE-2
Message-ID: <4F55485B.9020906@wichert.org>

I am running a model on a hot water reheat VAV system using Energy Pro 
and EP Support tells me that there is a DOE-2 restriction on the hot 
water (boiler) setpoint that it MUST BE less than the condenser 
setpoint.  Since the condenser doesn't touch the hot water loop, this 
doesn't make sense to me from a physical standpoint, but if it's a DOE-2 
restriction, then how do you model an (admittedly inefficient) hot water 
reheat VAV system in DOE-2 with a water cooled condenser?

1)     Has anybody modeled a hot-water reheat VAV system in EP with a 
water cooled condenser?  Can you give me a hint?

2)    Has anybody modeled a hot-water reheat VAV system in DOE-2 with a 
water cooled condenser?  Any tricks needed to make it work?

This is an old system, so probably not for new construction, but I am 
working on upgrades.


Thanks for taking the time to read this, and if you can help, I will 
appreciate it very much.

Great discussion. I have updated the "What guides and 
reports may be useful?" topic on the FAQ to include many of 
the guidelines that people have suggested. See:

http://onebuilding.org/wiki/doku.php

More suggestions are welcome.

Thanks

Jason

Ellen,

A couple that I haven't seen mentioned above:

GB 50189-2005 - "Design Standard for Energy Efficiency of Public Buildings"
- This contains some specific guidance for energy analysis for projects in
China.

Also the USGBC has provided a technical manual called

"Advanced Energy Modeling for LEED"
http://www.gbci.org/files/leedonline/Advanced_Energy_Modeling_for_LEED_V2_1c.pdf

Also I have seen 90.1 mentioned, but not a specific mention of the 90.1
Users Manual which I personally found very helpful when I was first picking
up modeling.

Message-ID: <BAFC68F9A9A30443BAB64F153C572BD506806F25@MBX10.d.ethz.ch>

Dear colleagues,

we will soon be launching a project that will investigate different aspects of wood as a construction material. One of the work packages will look into the differences in space heat demand, due to the effect of thermal inertia, for different wall compositions.

Currently I am assembling a list of simulation software that is well fit for this task. So far I was thinking of EnergyPlus, IDA-ICE and TRNSYS. 

My first guess would be that all of those tools are sufficient for such an analysis. However I would be happy about an expert opinion on that.
Does someone here have any experience on that particular matter?
Do you know studies that compare different software solutions, including the issue of thermal inertia?
Would you oppose certain software or suggest other ones?

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Kind regards,
Niko Heeren.

Concerning the question of the number of building energy 
modelers, one indication may be how many people subscribe to 
various mailing lists:

BLDG-SIM - 2307 members
eQUEST-users - 1821 members
EnergyPlus_Support - 3079 members
TRNSYS-users - 1311 members
EPS-r mailing list - about 500 members

I believe these are the email lists related to BEM with the 
most subscribers.

Of course not every modeler subscribes to a mailing list and 
some modelers subscribe to multiple mailing lists so trying 
to draw a conclusion about the number of modelers may be 
difficult.

	Engineering
Message-ID: <1B23446CBF250648A2FC775DE3FE7E80061CFE@OC11expo28.exchange.mit.edu>

Dear colleagues,

The presentation below might be of interest for those of you in the greater Boston area.

Next Monday, March 12th, at 12.30 Stephen Kemp, one of the principals of Enermodal Engineering, will be talking at MIT about "Commissioning Low Energy Buildings". The presentation is part of the Building Technology Lecture Series and will be in Room 7-431. Enermodal is a leading Canadian consulting firm exclusively dedicated to creating green buildings and communities.  Their recent work on using energy models generated during the design process to commission buildings during operation is remarkably innovative, especially since they are doing this work in a for-profit context. Please feel free to join us. For more information visit http://bt.mit.edu/?m=201203.

Best,

Christoph

I love this topic.

In addition to all previously mentioned guidelines and protocols, please add GreenStar (Australia, South Africa and now Ghana) energy modelling protocol on the list.

http://www.gbcsa.org.za/docs/greenstar/GSSA_Office_v1_Energy_Guide_20100701.pdf the protocol for SA.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Building Energy Modeling Guidelines

Concerning the question of the number of building energy
modelers, one indication may be how many people subscribe to
various mailing lists:

BLDG-SIM - 2307 members
eQUEST-users - 1821 members
EnergyPlus_Support - 3079 members
TRNSYS-users - 1311 members
EPS-r mailing list - about 500 members

I believe these are the email lists related to BEM with the
most subscribers.

Of course not every modeler subscribes to a mailing list and
some modelers subscribe to multiple mailing lists so trying
to draw a conclusion about the number of modelers may be
difficult.

Message-ID: <CACsFbrCdJYZ8gK3wauDLBPvv21QTxN4ZPzHs_3_HJWt9R5GwAA@mail.gmail.com>

Hey All,

Quick question....how do I get a .bin weather file.  I'm not familiar with
this file type.

I've tried converting to a .bin in the Ecotect "Convert Weather Data" tab,
but it won't switch whatever file you have to a .bin.

Any help would be great.  Thanks.

TMY2 or TMY3 weather files utilize the .bin format which is what eQUEST
reads.  Here is the doe2.com list that has all of the TMY2 and TMY3
weather files for the US.  There is also a link to zip files for weather
data from international locations.

*.bin is the file format used by DOE-2.1E and DOE-2.2, which is the underlying simulation 
engine for eQUEST.
It's a surprisingly small binary file of only 148K, because the data have been "packed", 
i.e., the numbers have been combined numerically to be "unpacked" when read by DOE-2. This 
was done to minimize computer storage which was a consideration when DOE-2 was first 
designed in the early 80's.  The downsides to these packed files are: (1) some loss of 
precision, and (2) you need special programs to convert the files into something humanly 
readable. Perhaps none of this is relevant to most users, who just need a *.bin weather 
file for their specific location and have no interest in looking at the weather data 
itself, but I throw out these two sentences just to explain what they are.

There is no recognizable depository of *.bin files, but there are plenty of them floating 
around in various places. For example, the eQUEST web site ( www.doe2.com/index_Wth.html ) 
has a number of standard weather data sets, almost entirely for the US, California, and 
Canada.   I've also got NREL's new TMY3 weather files in *.bin format for 1020 US 
locations on my company website (www.whiteboxtechnologies.com/weather_data.html ).
The eQUEST web site also has a utility program (eQ_WthProc) that allows users to convert 
EPW files to bin files.

If you don't find a *.bin file meeting your needs from the above, it's also possible to 
create a *.bin file from raw weather data. <caution - advertising follows :-) >   I have 
been offering a service to create weather files in *.bin (or other commonly used formats) 
for any location available in the National Climatic Data Center's (NCDC) massive 
Integrated Surface Hourly (ISH) archive that contains historical weather records for 
around 8,000 international locations (1,500 in the US, 600 in Canada) going back to 1980.  
Those interested can e-mail for details.

Message-ID: <4F57C4C6.3060503@wichert.org>

I am trying to learn E-Quest and I am trying to model a building that I 
have already modeled with Energy Pro.  The gas usage from E-Quest is 
very very low compared to both actual and Energy Pro.  It is a hot water 
reheat VAV system with a boiler and a water cooled condenser.  The 
actual gas use is 17891 Therms, from the bills.  Energy Pro predicts 
17600 Therms.  E-Quest predicts 580 Therms.  This makes no sense to me, 
but it is clearly my error.  I have gone over the inputs several times.

Is there anything that occurs to anybody that would make gas usage that 
far off?

Electrical from E-Quest is 453 MWh.  Electrical from Energy Pro is 422 
MWh.  Electrical actual is 543 MWh.  The building has lots of 
unaccounted-for process equipment, so I'm not so worried about being low 
on electrical.  It's not too far off.  But the gas use is just way too 
low.  Hot water is showing up at 3 Therms a month.


This is the first model I have done with E-Quest, so I apologize for 
even asking.  It's obviously something stupid that I have done.

I've always found the default plug & lighting loads in eQuest to be on the
high-side which has a significant affect on space temperatures and space
conditioning energy.

I would take a look at your unmet load hours in the perimeter spaces.  If
they're high it's likely that you have a heating air flow rate or supply
air temperature issue.

You might want to take the online eQuest course from
http://energy-models.com/training/equest/course-objectives
I found it to be very helpful when learning eQuest.

I would guess your issue is occupancy differences, or deep in the HVAC
system like Morgan suggests..

A quick thought:   REHEAT-DELTA-T is a zonal input that has specifically caught me and others multiple times for systems with reheat.  It's something that isn't optional for some systems, and doesn't have a default coming out of the wizards so you have to physically enter something (I typically right-click and enter stuff like this as a user-defined default - blue text - more in the archives if you're interested).  If you leave the inputs blank the reheat won't engage.

If it's not that, efficiencies are relatively easy to check.  I would scan your reheat and preheat inputs (if applicable) next:   Right-click and review the DOES2 help entries under heat, reheat, and preheat (at the zones) for any inputs you've allowed to default/leave blank - you might just need to fill in one more box ;).

Hey All,

Quick question....how do I get a .bin weather file.  I'm not familiar with this file type.

I've tried converting to a .bin in the Ecotect "Convert Weather Data" tab, but it won't switch whatever file you have to a .bin.

Any help would be great.  Thanks.

Figure I'd throw in my two cents:

Weatheranalytics.com is something I've also grown comfortable recommending when you need actual data for a specific location and a specific period.  Great for calibration, meaningful daylight savings studies, etc...  The system they've put together is really pretty amazing for what it accomplishes, interpolating weather data for any point on the globe between available weatherstations/resources.  Their telephone/email response time has always been very prompt and helpful in my experience and is a big reason I continue to utilize this service.  In cases where the weather data produced seems awry, I found this these guys super-eager to help review, educate me as necessary, and otherwise make things right without charging any extra fees or turning unresponsive.

I have zero affiliations with this service, by the way.  Just relating my positive experiences.

For their fee, they generate a zip file that includes the requested weather data in a series of formats (bin,csv,epw,tm2,tm3), alongside a small text file serving as a reference for the header nomenclature.  The .bin file provided should be DOE2/eQuest compatible, but I have and continue to convert the .epw file they provide into a .bin.

I regularly convert the .epw using the free eQ_WthProc software, found here:  http://doe2.com/index_Wth.html.  The reason I pursue this extra effort is this process has the benefit of producing some easily navigable and well-formatted visual graphs of the data's DB/WB/Windspeed/Solar (Direct & Horz) over the year, making it a breeze to check whether anything is awry.  These animated/interactive visuals (play with the zooming features!) double as effective marketing/report/communicative material for whenever I need to reference the actual weather to explain a result/behavior.

If you are interested in trying eQ_WthProc, make a point to read what the doe2.com webpage says carefully regarding the ".ini reset" procedure - the program as it is currently available requires you do take this extra step to get it installed and working correctly.

Of course, I will use freely available .bin TMY data wherever I can get it and it's appropriate for the model =).  Hope this helps!

It's a surprisingly small binary file of only 148K, because the data have been "packed", i.e., the numbers have been combined numerically to be "unpacked" when read by DOE-2. This was done to minimize computer storage which was a consideration when DOE-2 was first designed in the early 80's.  The downsides to these packed files are: (1) some loss of precision, and (2) you need special programs to convert the files into something humanly readable. Perhaps none of this is relevant to most users, who just need a *.bin weather file for their specific location and have no interest in looking at the weather data itself, but I throw out these two sentences just to explain what they are.

There is no recognizable depository of *.bin files, but there are plenty of them floating around in various places. For example, the eQUEST web site ( www.doe2.com/index_Wth.html<http://www.doe2.com/index_Wth.html> ) has a number of standard weather data sets, almost entirely for the US, California, and Canada.   I've also got NREL's new TMY3 weather files in *.bin format for 1020 US locations on my company website (www.whiteboxtechnologies.com/weather_data.html<http://www.whiteboxtechnologies.com/weather_data.html> ).
The eQUEST web site also has a utility program (eQ_WthProc) that allows users to convert EPW files to bin files.

If you don't find a *.bin file meeting your needs from the above, it's also possible to create a *.bin file from raw weather data.  <caution - advertising follows :-) >   I have been offering a service to create weather files in *.bin (or other commonly used formats) for any location available in the National Climatic Data Center's (NCDC) massive Integrated Surface Hourly (ISH) archive that contains historical weather records for around 8,000 international locations (1,500 in the US, 600 in Canada) going back to 1980.

Yes! Thank you all for the help.  The deleting of .ini file initially
tripped me up, but eventually got it right.

I will keep weatheranalytics.com in mind if we ever need any weather files
we can't find.  Does  weatheranalytics.com have a lot of the international
weather files that are sometimes harder to come by?

ASHRAE has just released a set of   IWEC2 weather files for 3,012 international 
locations.  These are for sale on a DVD through the ASHRAE Bookstore ($199 members, $229 
non-members).  For details, see

http://www.techstreet.com/cgi-bin/detail?product_id=1823067

Included in this set are weather files for 1118 locations in Europe, 864 in Asia, 173 in 
Oceania, 144 in South America, 65 in Central America, 192 in Africa, and even 7 in 
Antarctica.  I will post the list as soon as I get permission from the ASHRAE Bookstore to 
do so.

ASHRAE is now also making plans to sell these weather files individually or subsets on the 
Web.

Hello,
?
I would kindly ask for information please.
I am doing energy modeling for LEED EAc1 complinace in Energy Pro. It is a mixed use building (retail and residential). The HVAC system is as follows: ?for RETAIL: ?Unconditioned fresh air is supplied by roof mounted supply fan (SF) to the zone where? one portion is mixed with ?indoor air and ?introduced to the indoor unit of split electrically driven heat pump. The other portion of the fresh air is supplied around kitchen hood serving as an air curtain and?exhaust is by kitchen hoods. For residential - electrical baseboard heaters only + natural ventilation. 
Corridors are not conditioned but just ventilated (fresh air supply + exhaust for each corridor per floor) 
My?concerns are as follows?.
?
1) ?How to model retail HVAC system? One room is one zone.
My approach would be: 
@ system level/Split DX/Heating and Cooling capacity of outdoor unit/ Enter fan cfm and HP for outdoor unit as per cut sheet
@ zone level/ zonal system/select variable refrigerant flow (just to account for heating and cooling capacity), enter heating and cooling capacity of indoor unit / fan tab enter cfm from ?fan cut sheet (mixed air)
@ room level/ exhaust fan tab/ enter cfm being exhausted (to account kitchen hoods)
?
How to model SF? Perhaps to include additional zone and room, where internal loads are zero, room is unconditioned with cfm and HP entered @ zone level? ??
?
2) How to model electrical baseboard heaters? One room is one zone.
My approach would be: @ system level , select any system without heating/cooling. At zone level, select e.g. VAV box and put Heating Output only. 
?
3) How to model ventilation for corridors?. One zone includes corridors on several levels
My approach would be: 
@ system level: select any system without heating/cooling, no input for fan
@zone level/ select e.g. VAV box or diffuser/ enter air supply cfm ?but without heating/cooling
@ room level/ exhaust fan tab/ enter cfm being exhausted 
?
?Thanks,Sasa

I've always found the default plug & lighting loads in eQuest to be on the high-side which has a significant affect on space temperatures and space conditioning energy.

Patrick,

Yes, weather analytics has files for the entire globe (about 150,000 land based locations and another 500,000 over the oceans).  They are built by integrating all of the stored ground station observations with a newly released high resolution historical data set from NOAA.  Since they are built on demand you can chose TMY2 or TMY3 or any single actual year or running 12 month period.

Lots of work but pretty cool, as we are hoping it to enable higher precision and energy responsive designs.

Happy to answer any questions.

Chuck

Yes! Thank you all for the help.  The deleting of .ini file initially tripped me up, but eventually got it right. 

I will keep weatheranalytics.com in mind if we ever need any weather files we can't find.  Does  weatheranalytics.com have a lot of the international weather files that are sometimes harder to come by?

  Figure I?d throw in my two cents:



  Weatheranalytics.com is something I?ve also grown comfortable recommending when you need actual data for a specific location and a specific period.  Great for calibration, meaningful daylight savings studies, etc?  The system they?ve put together is really pretty amazing for what it accomplishes, interpolating weather data for any point on the globe between available weatherstations/resources.  Their telephone/email response time has always been very prompt and helpful in my experience and is a big reason I continue to utilize this service.  In cases where the weather data produced seems awry, I found this these guys super-eager to help review, educate me as necessary, and otherwise make things right without charging any extra fees or turning unresponsive.



  I have zero affiliations with this service, by the way.  Just relating my positive experiences.



  For their fee, they generate a zip file that includes the requested weather data in a series of formats (bin,csv,epw,tm2,tm3), alongside a small text file serving as a reference for the header nomenclature.  The .bin file provided should be DOE2/eQuest compatible, but I have and continue to convert the .epw file they provide into a .bin.  



  I regularly convert the .epw using the free eQ_WthProc software, found here:  http://doe2.com/index_Wth.html.  The reason I pursue this extra effort is this process has the benefit of producing some easily navigable and well-formatted visual graphs of the data?s DB/WB/Windspeed/Solar (Direct & Horz) over the year, making it a breeze to check whether anything is awry.  These animated/interactive visuals (play with the zooming features!) double as effective marketing/report/communicative material for whenever I need to reference the actual weather to explain a result/behavior.



  If you are interested in trying eQ_WthProc, make a point to read what the doe2.com webpage says carefully regarding the ?.ini reset? procedure ? the program as it is currently available requires you do take this extra step to get it installed and working correctly. 



  Of course, I will use freely available .bin TMY data wherever I can get it and it?s appropriate for the model =).  Hope this helps!

  *.bin is the file format used by DOE-2.1E and DOE-2.2, which is the underlying simulation engine for eQUEST.
  It's a surprisingly small binary file of only 148K, because the data have been "packed", i.e., the numbers have been combined numerically to be "unpacked" when read by DOE-2. This was done to minimize computer storage which was a consideration when DOE-2 was first designed in the early 80's.  The downsides to these packed files are: (1) some loss of precision, and (2) you need special programs to convert the files into something humanly readable. Perhaps none of this is relevant to most users, who just need a *.bin weather file for their specific location and have no interest in looking at the weather data itself, but I throw out these two sentences just to explain what they are.

  There is no recognizable depository of *.bin files, but there are plenty of them floating around in various places. For example, the eQUEST web site ( www.doe2.com/index_Wth.html ) has a number of standard weather data sets, almost entirely for the US, California, and Canada.   I've also got NREL's new TMY3 weather files in *.bin format for 1020 US locations on my company website (www.whiteboxtechnologies.com/weather_data.html ). 
  The eQUEST web site also has a utility program (eQ_WthProc) that allows users to convert EPW files to bin files.

  If you don't find a *.bin file meeting your needs from the above, it's also possible to create a *.bin file from raw weather data.  <caution - advertising follows :-) >   I have been offering a service to create weather files in *.bin (or other commonly used formats) for any location available in the National Climatic Data Center's (NCDC) massive Integrated Surface Hourly (ISH) archive that contains historical weather records for around 8,000 international locations (1,500 in the US, 600 in Canada) going back to 1980.

A follow up for Robert and others:

I recall Robert mentioning he's new with eQuest so my response was probably a bit cryptic, and I happen to have a model open and appropriate for illustrating what I'm talking about.  This is a good opportunity to clarify my advice for reheat systems and share some more tidbits all eQuest users should be aware of.

Recognizing this is [bldg-sim], what follows is eQuest-specific procedure/advice geared for new/intermediate users:

REHEAT-DELTA-T is an input after the wizards and in detailed mode.  It can be input for the system and/or for the zones served - where you define it is determined by the type of system you are using (right-click the input field and read the associated help topic for more details).

Navigate to the 'Airside systems tab' and then double-click on a conditioned zone (not a plenum) under a system in the tree on the left.  From there, you can find the zone heating tab:
[cid:image002.png at 01CCFD08.F4822F80]

Alternatively, you can find REHEAT-DELTA-T for a system by double-clicking a system and navigating to the heating > Coil/Capacity tab.  My advice below is that if you are seeing white boxes, then you may want to try entering something.

In a typical scenario, this number is added to the discharge temperature defined at the system level, indirectly defining the discharge temperature for your terminal boxes... In the example above I wanted the box to put out 100F heating air per the HVAC design, and the central unit was discharging 68F, so I arrived at setting a 32F delta.

I mentioned "user-defined defaults" / "blue text" as well:  suffice to say that is something every intermediate/advanced user really should know about, but beginners can comfortably put off to learn later.  It's merely a means of using the program more efficiently.  Again, instructions are in the archives ;).

Finally, I and others will commonly say "read the help for that input" and I recognize this may not seem intuitive/easy given the massiveness of the DOE2 help file and how little is in the actual eQuest help file.  This comes up often, so here's a quick visual of what some of us are getting at:

[cid:image001.png at 01CCFD1D.EBE00DB0]

Almost EVERY input field has a corresponding help entry in the various help resources that come with eQuest.  You can most easily find them by right-clicking the field you want to learn more about for a context menu, then mousing over the first item: "Item Help"  This will bring up one or more references that will bring you straight to something pertinent to what you're looking at, most of the time.  All eQuest users are ultimately self-taught to some extent, and this way of using the resources at your fingertips is something not to miss!

Best of luck!

A quick thought:   REHEAT-DELTA-T is a zonal input that has specifically caught me and others multiple times for systems with reheat.  It's something that isn't optional for some systems, and doesn't have a default coming out of the wizards so you have to physically enter something (I typically right-click and enter stuff like this as a user-defined default - blue text - more in the archives if you're interested).  If you leave the inputs blank the reheat won't engage.

If it's not that, efficiencies are relatively easy to check.  I would scan your reheat and preheat inputs (if applicable) next:   Right-click and review the DOES2 help entries under heat, reheat, and preheat (at the zones) for any inputs you've allowed to default/leave blank - you might just need to fill in one more box ;).

I would guess your issue is occupancy differences, or deep in the HVAC system like Morgan suggests..

reheat VAV system with a boiler and a water cooled condenser.  The
actual gas use is 17891 Therms, from the bills.  Energy Pro predicts
17600 Therms.  E-Quest predicts 580 Therms.  This makes no sense to me,
but it is clearly my error.  I have gone over the inputs several times.

Is there anything that occurs to anybody that would make gas usage that
far off?

Electrical from E-Quest is 453 MWh.  Electrical from Energy Pro is 422
MWh.  Electrical actual is 543 MWh.  The building has lots of
unaccounted-for process equipment, so I'm not so worried about being low
on electrical.  It's not too far off.  But the gas use is just way too
low.  Hot water is showing up at 3 Therms a month.


This is the first model I have done with E-Quest, so I apologize for
even asking.  It's obviously something stupid that I have done.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] A critical juncture for Modelica/FMI next week
Message-ID: <E7DE1359657DA948A14588A22C4C7D9701A24ED534A6@EQ-SRV-SBS-01.EQUA.local>

Dear all,

There is a meeting of the FMI (www.functional-mockup-interface.org<http://www.functional-mockup-interface.org>) design group Monday and Tuesday next week where most likely the level of ambition of FMI 2.0 will be settled. Different application areas have different needs and priorities and I think it would be wise to provide some input from the building simulation community to this meeting. Let me first give some background.

The ultimate purpose of equation based simulation and Modelica (www.modelica.org<http://www.modelica.org>) is to enable model exchange between users and tools. However, the Modelica language is by necessity a very complex and rapidly evolving "beast." It is essentially impossible to keep tools in good sync with each other in their interpretation of Modelica. In practice, this means that porting complex model libraries, such as the MSL Fluid and Media libraries and derivatives, from one tool to another often involves man years of work, if possible at all. This is where FMI comes in. FMI provides a means to exchange pre-compiled model units and this can be radically simpler than to achieve a common understanding and interpretation of the underlying Modelica code. FMI 1.0 has proven this since a number of years. However, for our application FMI 1.0 is severely limited.

There are three key areas where FMI 2.0 has previously been planned to be enhanced in ways that in my opinion are essential to the building simulation community:


-          Introduction of physical connectors (now only direct variable-to-variable connections are supported)

-          Support for arrays, the size of which is determined by parameters that can be changed after compilation (only scalars in FMI 1.0)

-          Support for sparse analytical Jacobians

In the building simulation world of multiple-port tanks and zones, where many components are built around  discretized PDE:s, FMI without these features is unlikely to become very useful. At the same time the FMI design group is facing some seriously conflicting goals:


-          FMI must not be too rapidly evolving - otherwise much of the purpose is lost

-          The standard must not be too complex for vendors to support

-          There is an urgent need to upgrade v. 1.0 to something more powerful

Therefore, there is a distinct risk that some of the planned enhancements of 2.0 are postponed. For reasons of stability, it could take a very long time before the next major release.



If you share my concern about these issues, please write a few lines to underline why we need these features to me.  I will compile for the FMI design committee.



Best regards,



Per Sahlin

Subject: Re: teleconference about IEA proposal "Modelica-based next-generation tools for new and existing buildings and communities"

All,

Thanks to those who contributed to today's conference call. Attached please find the meeting minutes. Please let me know any important omissions or corrections.

As discussed, I also added a google doc where each of you can add your interest in participation and in leading a particular subtask. There is also a column in which you can specify your funding situation for the respective work, and a column in which you can add demonstration objects that could be included in the revised proposal. The link to this spreadsheet is
   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnSvCGCOHhzXdHBOSDRuLXJOd2tvSlBzUXBHaU93NVE
Anyone with the link can edit and view the document. So don't add sensitive information or proprietary information. You are free to share this document, as well as the proposal, at
  https://docs.google.com/a/lbl.gov/document/d/1ia1jyXrvf1jUynN_1-3QBx0quYdXlOdYgPTacpE6lLU/edit?hl=en_US&pli=1
with your ExCo delegate and/or your potential funding agency.

Depending on how many people work on the respective subtasks, some subtasks might be combined in future revision. For now I kept the structure that resulted from the Sydney meeting.

All the best,

Michael

All,

We would like to schedule a teleconference with those of you who are interested in participating in the IEA proposal "Modelica-based next-generation tools for new and existing buildings and communities" that was discussed in Sydney last November.

To schedule the call, please respond by Wednesday February 8 to the poll at  http://www.doodle.com/c5fvhz5uuzuq7ykr.
If you like to be removed from future emails, please respond to me.

The proposal is at https://docs.google.com/a/lbl.gov/document/d/1ia1jyXrvf1jUynN_1-3QBx0quYdXlOdYgPTacpE6lLU/edit?hl=en_US&pli=1 and attached to this email. This version addresses the feedback from the Sydney meeting, as well as feedback received from the Fraunhofer Institute in Kassel.

The items to be discussed at the phone call are below.


 1.  Outline of next steps.
Proposal due April 16, presentation to IEA ExCo meeting on June 14.
If approved, there will be a 1 year planning period (we will check whether this can be accelerated), followed by 3 years of research and 1 year of reporting.
 2.  Expression of interest of research groups to work on the proposed research.
Individual research groups should express what tasks they like to contribute to, and are likely to get funded from their respective country.
 3.  Indication of subtask leaders.
Note: Subtask leaders need not be finalized by June, but an indication of what country will lead what task is recommended. The subtask leaders can be finalized during the planning period.
Subtask leaders need a minimum commitment of 3 months/year.
 4.  Inform your ExCo delegate.
The ExCo delegates will need to verbally confirm at the June meeting that funding will be available in their country and that the proposal is in the interest of their country. For the proposal to be accepted, around five (minimum 3) countries need to commit to participate. It therefore is essential that you discuss the proposal and your interest to participate with your ExCo delegate prior to the June meeting. See http://www.ecbcs.org/contacts.htm for a list of ExCo delegates.
 5.  Other points of discussion.

Please let me know if there is anything else you would like to add to the agenda.

All the best,

Michael Wetter & Jan Hensen

Per,

It is impressive ... but it sounds too abstract to me to digest.
Can you help me to think about FMI in terms of a BEM (building energy
modeling) task.

For example:
1) There is a  system of ODEs (2 o3 equations), which represents a
simple (say 3R2C or 3R3C) thermal network (TN), which in turn models a
thermal zone.

2) There is another set of equations and inequalities that specifies HVAC
system.

3) There is a given weather file (temps, radiation, etc) which provides
some set of time series variables (1hour sample time) for those ODEs.

4) There are 2-3-4 schedule files, which  specifies other sets of
variables/parameters  ( 1hour - 1day - 1month sample time ) for those
thermal zones and HVAC.

Today I am using Matlab/Simulink to simulate this (1-4) problem.

In case if I need more complex building and HVAC models I may think about
BCVTB(LBNL) (people already do this) to co-simulate various combinations of
E+ and Matlab models.

What role and how can FMI/FMU play in such a game?

Thank you

Pavel

Hi Pavel,

It is difficult to explain these things in totally concrete terms. It has to do with simulation model scalability, portability, abstraction and ease-of-use.

Both Simulink and Modelica tools offer ways of describing and simulating the behavior of a wide class of dynamical systems. This allows you to tailor exactly the equations you want to use, for example in the way you outline below. This total freedom is often needed in building simulation problems, since the number of different component models needed for various studies is for all practical purposes infinite. No tool with a fixed set of models will ever be sufficient.

Now, a full-fledged building zone model like that of E+, or our tool IDA ICE, will not require 2-3 equations, but rather on the order of a thousand variables per zone. A fair number of these represent things that are meaningful to observe directly, such as the temperature of the third layer of a particular wall and others are just help variables that are needed to compute for example a sliding average. If you then want to model a thousand zone building, you get by all standards a fairly complex and large system of ordinary differential and algebraic equations (DAEs) to solve. This is where the scalability comes in; not all approaches will be able to handle this size of problem.

When you have this many equations to keep track of, no single person or even team will have the required expertise about each type of process that needs modelling. Portability and abstraction becomes needed. If you can specialize in a particular field, such as advanced heat pump modelling, and then package your models in a way  that will plug right into relevant neighboring models and in a variety of tools, many people can use them without knowing each detail. This is the ultimate purpose of Modelica and FMI.

A building simulation model must also be possible to set up and operate by a person that knows absolutely nothing about Modelica, DAEs and variable timestep solvers. Therefore, it must also be possible to package these equation-based models in a way that, on the surface, looks much the same as traditional BEM tools - the ease-of-use.

I hope this was of some help. If you are interested to learn more about these things, browse the conference proceedings available on https://www.modelica.org/publications , where you can see how Modelica has been applied in many different domains.

Best regards,

Per

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] A critical juncture for Modelica/FMI next week

Per,

It is impressive ... but it sounds too abstract to me to digest.
Can you help me to think about FMI in terms of a BEM (building energy modeling) task.

For example:
1) There is a  system of ODEs (2 o3 equations), which represents a simple (say 3R2C or 3R3C) thermal network (TN), which in turn models a thermal zone.

2) There is another set of equations and inequalities that specifies HVAC system.

3) There is a given weather file (temps, radiation, etc) which provides some set of time series variables (1hour sample time) for those ODEs.

4) There are 2-3-4 schedule files, which  specifies other sets of variables/parameters  ( 1hour - 1day - 1month sample time ) for those thermal zones and HVAC.

Today I am using Matlab/Simulink to simulate this (1-4) problem.

In case if I need more complex building and HVAC models I may think about BCVTB(LBNL) (people already do this) to co-simulate various combinations of E+ and Matlab models.

What role and how can FMI/FMU play in such a game?

Thank you

Pavel

Dear all,

There is a meeting of the FMI (www.functional-mockup-interface.org<http://www.functional-mockup-interface.org>) design group Monday and Tuesday next week where most likely the level of ambition of FMI 2.0 will be settled. Different application areas have different needs and priorities and I think it would be wise to provide some input from the building simulation community to this meeting. Let me first give some background.

The ultimate purpose of equation based simulation and Modelica (www.modelica.org<http://www.modelica.org>) is to enable model exchange between users and tools. However, the Modelica language is by necessity a very complex and rapidly evolving "beast." It is essentially impossible to keep tools in good sync with each other in their interpretation of Modelica. In practice, this means that porting complex model libraries, such as the MSL Fluid and Media libraries and derivatives, from one tool to another often involves man years of work, if possible at all. This is where FMI comes in. FMI provides a means to exchange pre-compiled model units and this can be radically simpler than to achieve a common understanding and interpretation of the underlying Modelica code. FMI 1.0 has proven this since a number of years. However, for our application FMI 1.0 is severely limited.

There are three key areas where FMI 2.0 has previously been planned to be enhanced in ways that in my opinion are essential to the building simulation community:


-          Introduction of physical connectors (now only direct variable-to-variable connections are supported)

-          Support for arrays, the size of which is determined by parameters that can be changed after compilation (only scalars in FMI 1.0)

-          Support for sparse analytical Jacobians

In the building simulation world of multiple-port tanks and zones, where many components are built around  discretized PDE:s, FMI without these features is unlikely to become very useful. At the same time the FMI design group is facing some seriously conflicting goals:


-          FMI must not be too rapidly evolving - otherwise much of the purpose is lost

-          The standard must not be too complex for vendors to support

-          There is an urgent need to upgrade v. 1.0 to something more powerful

Therefore, there is a distinct risk that some of the planned enhancements of 2.0 are postponed. For reasons of stability, it could take a very long time before the next major release.



If you share my concern about these issues, please write a few lines to underline why we need these features to me.  I will compile for the FMI design committee.



Best regards,



Per Sahlin

Subject: Re: teleconference about IEA proposal "Modelica-based next-generation tools for new and existing buildings and communities"

All,

Thanks to those who contributed to today's conference call. Attached please find the meeting minutes. Please let me know any important omissions or corrections.

As discussed, I also added a google doc where each of you can add your interest in participation and in leading a particular subtask. There is also a column in which you can specify your funding situation for the respective work, and a column in which you can add demonstration objects that could be included in the revised proposal. The link to this spreadsheet is
   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnSvCGCOHhzXdHBOSDRuLXJOd2tvSlBzUXBHaU93NVE
Anyone with the link can edit and view the document. So don't add sensitive information or proprietary information. You are free to share this document, as well as the proposal, at
  https://docs.google.com/a/lbl.gov/document/d/1ia1jyXrvf1jUynN_1-3QBx0quYdXlOdYgPTacpE6lLU/edit?hl=en_US&pli=1
with your ExCo delegate and/or your potential funding agency.

Depending on how many people work on the respective subtasks, some subtasks might be combined in future revision. For now I kept the structure that resulted from the Sydney meeting.

All the best,

Michael

All,

We would like to schedule a teleconference with those of you who are interested in participating in the IEA proposal "Modelica-based next-generation tools for new and existing buildings and communities" that was discussed in Sydney last November.

To schedule the call, please respond by Wednesday February 8 to the poll at  http://www.doodle.com/c5fvhz5uuzuq7ykr.
If you like to be removed from future emails, please respond to me.

The proposal is at https://docs.google.com/a/lbl.gov/document/d/1ia1jyXrvf1jUynN_1-3QBx0quYdXlOdYgPTacpE6lLU/edit?hl=en_US&pli=1 and attached to this email. This version addresses the feedback from the Sydney meeting, as well as feedback received from the Fraunhofer Institute in Kassel.

The items to be discussed at the phone call are below.


 1.  Outline of next steps.
Proposal due April 16, presentation to IEA ExCo meeting on June 14.
If approved, there will be a 1 year planning period (we will check whether this can be accelerated), followed by 3 years of research and 1 year of reporting.
 2.  Expression of interest of research groups to work on the proposed research.
Individual research groups should express what tasks they like to contribute to, and are likely to get funded from their respective country.
 3.  Indication of subtask leaders.
Note: Subtask leaders need not be finalized by June, but an indication of what country will lead what task is recommended. The subtask leaders can be finalized during the planning period.
Subtask leaders need a minimum commitment of 3 months/year.
 4.  Inform your ExCo delegate.
The ExCo delegates will need to verbally confirm at the June meeting that funding will be available in their country and that the proposal is in the interest of their country. For the proposal to be accepted, around five (minimum 3) countries need to commit to participate. It therefore is essential that you discuss the proposal and your interest to participate with your ExCo delegate prior to the June meeting. See http://www.ecbcs.org/contacts.htm for a list of ExCo delegates.
 5.  Other points of discussion.

Please let me know if there is anything else you would like to add to the agenda.

All the best,

Michael Wetter & Jan Hensen

I read AM11 at least once a year.   It reminds me that I need more 
than one tool in my building performance simulation toolbox.  I agree 
with Jon that an energy code compliance modelling tool should not be 
with the tools you might use during the design process.  The 
integrated design process often becomes a bunch of people reviewing 
how many energy points their design is getting.

Personally, I feel compliance modelling ("gold star chasing") and 
"wizards" make it hard to develop a deep understanding of QA process 
of building simulation.

Hi Rasheed,
 
Have you found a place to do your PhD, yet? Dr Ivan Korolija was working with me on quantifying HVAC system energy consumption versus building heating and cooling load. He finished recently; you can find his PhD thesis here: http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jeplus/wiki/doku.php?id=research:publications <http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jeplus/wiki/doku.php?id=research:publications> . What he found was that a power law regression model typically gives a good prediction of office building HVAC consumption in the UK, if the building's loads are known. Of course during the study, we found more questions need to be addressed, than those have been covered by the thesis. If you are interested in this area, please let me or Ivan know.
 
Cheers,
 
Yi

Message-ID: <D1168E6C4207B742BFC631BD652B1E922D04248D42@MAILBOX1.nrel.gov>

Hi Bldg-Sim Community,

Has anyone out there had any experience modeling large double-walled canvas tents?  I'm looking for literature on the topic and recommended modeling strategies for accounting for the convection heat transfer between the inner shell and outer rain-fly-like shell.  The air gap between the two shells is large, typically between 14 and 27 inches.  The hope is that all the modeling can be done in EnergyPlus. Any advice or references would be a great help!

Thanks,
Lesley

Bill,

Any specific format?  I have a couple of sources, depending on what is being done:


-        The only modeling I have done for that location is in Trace and there is a built-in, 8760 weather file for Monterrey.

-        You can download a monthly/annual climate summary page (1971-2000 was the version I have) from the "Servicio Meteorologico Nacional" (http://smn.cna.gob.mx/) that could be used for ASHRAE Handbook methods or other weather summary purposes, but would need extrapolation for simulation purposes.

-        There are DOE2 bin files available at http://doe2.com/Download/Weather/NON-US/mexico.zip that include 3 for Monterrey, but I have not used them, only aware of their presence

There will probably be a few other sources that people have that I don't have.

Message-ID: <1331710171.62851.YahooMailNeo@web192501.mail.sg3.yahoo.com>

Dear all,

As per Appendix G 3.1.2.8, design air flow rate has to be determined by 20 deg F temperature difference. If the base case is PSZ and each zone is assigned with a separate PSZ system, then the CFM for that zone will be calculated in the software with the 20degF differential. 


The Zones are having high unmet hours. Will it be a correct practice if we increase the CFM in baseline case at zone level to reduce unmet hours. 


Regards,
Rathnashree

The Third Public Comment period is open until March 20th.
I see that the option for calibrated modeling for M&V was removed from the second draft and is now included in Pilot Credit 27: Reconcile Projected and Actual Energy Performance:
http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=2104 (Pilot credits page)
http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=8202 (Pilot Credit 27)

ASHRAE 90.1-2010 is used for the EA credits.
The energy performance improvement levels required to achieve points for the Optimize Energy Performance credit have been lowered since the second draft, presumably because the goal of 90.1-2010 was to reduce energy costs 30% relative to 90.1-2004 and it will be considerably more difficult to demonstrate savings compared to 90.1-2007. For example, 16% energy cost savings is good for 3 points in LEED 2009 for New Construction, but is 6 points in LEED 2012.

Bill

Dear bldg-sim'rs,

I usually take this kind of data for granted (our industry has been

Statistics not being my strong point, does anybody know of any good web 
resources for working out percentile data of various weather 
characteristics? I have hourly data available and would like to 
undertake the task in excel (or openoffice).

Dear All,

Thank you very much. This is all useful stuff. I guess binning isn't in 
the engineering culture over here in the UK in the same way it is in the 
UK. We tend merely to use hourly weather data to do simulations and can 
take design data from CIBSE (most of the time).

I'll definitely undertake these exercises. In the mean time, I wrote 
some very crude vba to step through the weather data and calculate its 
effect on battery charge which I'll be happy to share once I've tidied 
it up a bit.

Cheers

Chris

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Understanding BEPU for system with 2 stage gas
	absorption chiller
Message-ID: <4F61A705.3060606@kalpakrit.com>

Hello Friends,

I am modelling an office building which is run on electricity generated 
by natural gas fired generators (say, NGG). The exhaust heat is being 
used to run a 2-stage absorption chiller to provide complete space 
cooling for the building. However I have modeled exhaust heat as heat 
recovered in a hot water loop which also had to be supplemented by a 
boiler since eQUEST cannot model it without.

Now the issues are:

 1. Is this a good way to model the cooling? I will appreciate any
    nuances if someone can share those with me.
 2. Understanding of one key utility meter report "EGen" in BEPS/ BEPU.
    Please check out "GG input.jpeg". EGen, ESrp and FInp are allocated
    in the NGG Input box in the tabs electric meter, Surplus meter and
    Fuel meter respectively. FM1 is attached to the hot water exhaust
    coming from the GG Set. EM1 and FM2 are left default without any
    assignments. Another meter "EM3" which is a sub meter to EGen
    utility meter is reporting part consumption of all electricity usage
    in the building, however PS-F report shows complete energy
    consumption as 39XXXXX kWh units both in EGen (Utility) and EM3 (sub
    meter). Now the big questions are :
      * Is EGen and its sub meter EM3 indicating the fraction of energy
        consumption from the  whole or additional amount of energy
        requirement for the building which NGG was unable to provide?
      * If it is the additional energy requirement, then why is surplus
        meter showing any reading?
      * Is FInp and FM1 reporting overall gas consumption by the NGG?

I look forward to any inputs on these issues.
Thanks in advance!
Sincerely,
Anup

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Masonry Heater and LEED
Message-ID: <CAKnCpCFO17ocrPLRL0EgVGbifK5eNdQsFnFSSRY_NSsj5unezg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a LEED project that is utilizing a VRV system to provide heating and
cooling.  The building also has a masonry heater that the users will use
often as a heat source and for cooking.  I'm completing a LEED model for
this project and I'm not sure how to approach the baseline heating systems.
 The building has a fully functional VRV system - this would lead to
choosing System 4 - PSZ-HP.  However, the users will use the masonry heater
for heat whenever they can.  This might lead to choosing System 3, and
using a boiler.  Any thoughts or experience with similar projects?

Thanks,

Karen

Thanks Dru,
It's actually minimum wind speed occurrences that I'm interested in - 
when we aren't generating from the wind turbine. Perhaps the best 
solution is just get to grips with the E+ WTG model and use hourly data.

Each of the EPW files have a "stat" file.

But you might investigate the "DView" software.

I'm not quite sure what you're after -- detailed analysis 
(spreadsheetable) or just viewable.

We're doing an off grid system on a farm house in Cumbria, North 
England. If anybody has ever seen the film Withnail & I, it's just down 
the road from where the famous country retreat was filmed.

I'm trying to work out how often there's a need for the backup generator 
to kick in. I've done a crude exercise based on hourly data using vba 
which will suffice for now. It doesn't take into account rate at which 
batteries can be re-charged (yet), but it does allow for quite a big 
margin (70%) by assuming everything does a round trip through the 
batteries when they're not fully charged, plus the Depth of Discharge is 
relatively modest at 20%.

Talking to one supplier, the frequency of the generator kicking in 
sounds like a moot point - they're plc logic brings in the generator on 
a fairly regular basis to condition the batteries.

Cheers

Chris

Subject: [Bldg-sim] DAYSIM to eQuest workshop with Mike Nicklas,
 Early Bird pricing extended through march 19th
Message-ID: <assp.2422bad368.65362F60B91184408723EA5FA54CADE80BB2F1@wind.southface.org>

Daylighting and Daysim with eQUEST

Instructors: Mike Nicklas and Umesh Atre, Innovative Design

Of all high performance building design strategies, none will have a greater positive impact than daylighting. As occupants and building management personnel become increasingly aware of the energy, health, and productivity benefits associated with controlled daylighting, more and more designers are implementing these proven strategies.

This full-day workshop will first address those engaged in building design and will focus on issues critical to good daylighting, then on translating these daylighting principles into usable daylighting metrics. Participants will be introduced to computer modeling techniques using the ?Daysim? software.  The 3-D modeling software ?SketchUp? is used to create the daylighting models, and the energy modeling software ?eQUEST? will be used to demonstrate how daylighting results can be incorporated into energy models.

This workshop will carry participants through the key steps, from design concept to graphic model to Daysim?s daylighting analysis to eQUEST?s overall building energy simulation.  Participants are assumed to have a basic working knowledge of eQUEST.   Because of this assumed knowledge level regarding eQUEST, the workshop will not focus on general eQUEST training but rather on how to interface with DAYSIM and key issues relative how to interpret the information that results from eQUEST.

The workshop will focus on the following:


  *   Consideration of human factors
  *   Consideration of energy ramifications
  *   Accounting for site constraints and benefits
  *   Integrating daylighting strategies into your design
  *   Introduction to Daysim,
  *   Development of and using SketchUp models with Daysim,
  *   Detailed walkthrough of Daysim,
  *   Understanding Daysim output, and
  *   Converting Daysim output into usable hourly daylighting schedules for eQUEST

Early-bird pricing this workshop is $350. Early-bird pricing will close on Monday, March 19, 2012. Price will then increase to $425 (discount automatically applied and credited at check-out)

Message-ID: <6770429BC4498B45B627F96AF8FC047422C4A76FD9@helene>


Hi Chris,
Found your discussion regarding off-grid farmhouse on the Bldg-sim list very interesting. We are currently doing the design of power and heating system for an off-grid farmhouse in Cwm, Wales. I would be very interested in the approach you have taken to size the systems, sofwares used to model PV or Wind turbine with a diesel generator backup. I have used HOMER and PVsol to do the system sizing. But I am still struggling to accurately model a hybrid-system since HOMER is not a design tool but an optimisation tool. If anyone can share their experiences in modelling an off-grid system would be very useful.


Regards,
Apeksha

Karen -

Good question! I have a project right now using a wood stove.

If it's biomass, it technically isn't "fossil fuel", right?

So, whether VRF ("electric") OR biomass ("other") is the predominant heat source, in both cases you'd be up against the right-hand column of Table G3.1.1A for your baseline ... make sense?

Additionally, are you actually modeling the "energy cost" of the masonry heater in the proposed case?
(If so, a whole host of questions follow. Energy rate? Acceptable per LEED to use biomass heaters in model? Mechanism for modeling in eQUEST?) If so, then I believe you would be attempting to show the energy cost difference between heating with wood (eg "Other" fuel source) and heating with an electric single-zone heat pump.

On my job, there is a woodstove and a water source heatpump.

However, the client has indicated that the use of the woodstove will be only occasional, so we are allowing the load to be carried by the water-to-water heat pump only in the proposed case, and the baseline is from the right-hand column of Table G3.1.1A.

Additionally, they have 40+acres, and plan to harvest the wood on-site, so technically there is no cash paid for the woodfuel source ... ie it would only be a savings in the model versus the displaced electric heat pump heat ... so we feel we are conservative in neglecting it. Might be a different story if the client was purchasing their wood. Anyone ever do a calc of $ / BTU from dry hardwood versus natural gas versus heat pump heating?? ;)

Hi,

I have a LEED project that is utilizing a VRV system to provide heating and cooling.  The building also has a masonry heater that the users will use often as a heat source and for cooking.  I'm completing a LEED model for this project and I'm not sure how to approach the baseline heating systems.  The building has a fully functional VRV system - this would lead to choosing System 4 - PSZ-HP.  However, the users will use the masonry heater for heat whenever they can.  This might lead to choosing System 3, and using a boiler.  Any thoughts or experience with similar projects?

Thanks,

Karen

Hi Aaron,

Thanks for your response.  Wood is harvested on-site by the occupants.  My
project is very similar, and I think I will take the same approach.  You
might want to look into the CIR's because there was one from LEED 2.0 that
mentioned locally harvested wood for heat.  The ruling was in relation to
the renewable energy credit and indicated that credit can be taken for
renewable energy for any wood harvested from the site, or an adjacent site
with the same owner as long as there is a sustainable forestry plan.  Could
be worth an extra 7 points for you guys.

As far as how to model it - I'm using EnergyPlus these days so I have many
options for modeling the system.

Message-ID: <D410F3F02B0ACC4E8549E6402196D543096BE18A@cei-exch1.coffman.com>

I am modeling a building that will use steam produced by a Coal Fired central plant. My baseline system is system 3, PSZ, fossil fuel fired for multiple zones.

Per LEED's  District Thermal Energy V2, section 2.4.2.2, exception A, "For fuels used at the central plant that are not available at the building use the central plant rates for that fuel type in the Baseline and Proposed Case."

My understanding is that I will use an 80% efficient gas fired furnace for each PSZ, and then apply the heating value and cost of coal to the amount of BTU's used?

Is this a correct interpretation?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED baseline for data centers
Message-ID: <FD49521620A94E43B6D384F2F5594A27086BEB0709@temail01>

Hi,

I am doing the LEED v3 EA credit for a large office building with a data center and wanted to see if anyone had any experience with this and knew what the baseline should be.  In particular I wanted to know what standards (if any) there are for the following issues:


-       IT load schedule (is it flat or staggered as in the proposals to 90.1 2010 and Title 24 2011)?

-       CRAC/CRAH unit fans, is the basecase constant speed?

-       Hot aisle containment, can you take credit for higher DT, lower airflow?  If so, what is the baseline DT?

-       Air and water-side economizers can you omit them in the baseline?

-       CHW plant equipment, can you use a model that just meets the mandatory minimum equipment efficiencies?

Also, if anyone has reviewed any of the CIRs on this issue and has a cheat sheet of CIRs that would be helpful.

Thanks in advance,

Message-ID: <1332299981.64024.YahooMailNeo@web161303.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

Dear All,
It is stated in ASHRAE Handbook 2008 - HVAC Systems and Equipment ? that one of the major factors for deciding on the applicability of district cooling is the design cooling load density DCLD (i.e., cooling load per unit area of the ground surface). I wonder if someone came up with a reference value of DCLD above which district cooling becomes feasible. I know that DCLD reference value will depend on many environmental and financial factors, However, I want to use the DCLD reference values that you will provide as verification indices for the DCLD reference value for Kuwait.
Many thanks in advance.

Aaron / Karen:

I have not had the pleasure of modeling a wood stove or other wood-fueled heating for a LEED project - I'd defer to first read any wood-heating related CIR's and other material.

I can relate that I've successfully completed a reviewed LEED model that used multiple baseline systems however where we were clearly bridging the "electric" vs. "fossil fuel" divide.  In the case I'm thinking of we had electric heating generally but used gas radiant heaters for some large back of house areas.

In retrospect it was a significant amount of extra documentation / explanation when all was said and done, but local gas vs. electric rates ultimately required making that distinction in the baseline.

An outside the box thought:  Maybe interpreting the operation of your fancy fireplace as a free/cheap process internal heat load (applied only to the proposed model, with explanation) would be simpler from a baseline/documentation standpoint... Maybe =).

Hi Aaron,

Thanks for your response.  Wood is harvested on-site by the occupants.  My project is very similar, and I think I will take the same approach.  You might want to look into the CIR's because there was one from LEED 2.0 that mentioned locally harvested wood for heat.  The ruling was in relation to the renewable energy credit and indicated that credit can be taken for renewable energy for any wood harvested from the site, or an adjacent site with the same owner as long as there is a sustainable forestry plan.  Could be worth an extra 7 points for you guys.

As far as how to model it - I'm using EnergyPlus these days so I have many options for modeling the system.

Karen -

Good question! I have a project right now using a wood stove.

If it's biomass, it technically isn't "fossil fuel", right?

So, whether VRF ("electric") OR biomass ("other") is the predominant heat source, in both cases you'd be up against the right-hand column of Table G3.1.1A for your baseline ... make sense?

Additionally, are you actually modeling the "energy cost" of the masonry heater in the proposed case?
(If so, a whole host of questions follow. Energy rate? Acceptable per LEED to use biomass heaters in model? Mechanism for modeling in eQUEST?) If so, then I believe you would be attempting to show the energy cost difference between heating with wood (eg "Other" fuel source) and heating with an electric single-zone heat pump.

On my job, there is a woodstove and a water source heatpump.

However, the client has indicated that the use of the woodstove will be only occasional, so we are allowing the load to be carried by the water-to-water heat pump only in the proposed case, and the baseline is from the right-hand column of Table G3.1.1A.

Additionally, they have 40+acres, and plan to harvest the wood on-site, so technically there is no cash paid for the woodfuel source ... ie it would only be a savings in the model versus the displaced electric heat pump heat ... so we feel we are conservative in neglecting it. Might be a different story if the client was purchasing their wood. Anyone ever do a calc of $ / BTU from dry hardwood versus natural gas versus heat pump heating?? ;)

Hi,

I have a LEED project that is utilizing a VRV system to provide heating and cooling.  The building also has a masonry heater that the users will use often as a heat source and for cooking.  I'm completing a LEED model for this project and I'm not sure how to approach the baseline heating systems.  The building has a fully functional VRV system - this would lead to choosing System 4 - PSZ-HP.  However, the users will use the masonry heater for heat whenever they can.  This might lead to choosing System 3, and using a boiler.  Any thoughts or experience with similar projects?

Thanks,

Dear Ben,
I think you are right, the DCLD is the most important issue when considering District Cooling. I think you could calculate the pump energy consumption compared to the chiller consumption to determine whether to use the district cooling or not.
I have a district cooling case in China. The ground surface area of the park is about 58000m2 (160000m2 building area), and the peak cooling load is 5000RT. Actually, the park is even larger. the peak load of the district cooling will be increased to 16000RT, but I don't have the information of the rest of the park surface area. For your reference.

	heating/cooling loads
Message-ID: <1332549398.49303.YahooMailClassic@web171003.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>

Dear All,

I want to calculate annual heating/cooling loads in a building. But I am not sure how to handle ventilation loads. The main problem is how to specify the temperature for ventilaiton air.  

To my knowledge, different software uses various methods to consider the effects of ventiliton loads: 
In ESP-R, the temperature for ventialtion air can be constant or ambient. 
In DOE2.1, the thermal loads do not include the effects of ventilation.
In EnergyPlus, the ventilaiton loads will be added by considering ventilaiton air with ambient temperature. 

If the calculaiton of ventilation loads is using ambient temperature, then there is no differences between infiltration and ventilaiton. But in actual most of HVAC systems, ventilaiton air will be heated or cooled to a certain temperature (possible close to indoor air temprature) and then import it to indoor space. The thermal loads due to infiltration belong to space loads, while the ventilation loads belong to coil loads.  Hence, it sounds not to be fair using ambient temperaure to calculate ventilaiton loads. 

Do you think which is a better way to calculate ventilaiton loads using ambient or possilbe indoor temperature in order to estimate annual heating/cooling loads? or Annual heating/cooling loads itself should not include the influences of ventilation (like in DOE2.1e) as ventilation loads vary a lot in different types of HVAC systems? Then annual heating/cooling loads itself may not be a very good concept at all. 

Thanks,

Jim

Hi Alex,

 

These errors could be related to your assemblies (2 thermal bridges in the
same composition, layers with no width, etc.).

 

Another common error is related to the heavy floor, try to put them in
medium weight floor if it?s not the case.

 

A way figure out where the error is coming from is by sequentially deleting
your zones or spaces (after you have saved a copy of your .bld)  and see if
it comes from one the specific zone.  Otherwise, I think it would be related
to your assemblies.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Model validation protocol
Message-ID: <001e01cd0cdc$df2429c0$9d6c7d40$@com>

Hi,

This requires input from masters of energy modelling, so plz give
suggestions!

I have modelled a test chamber with radiant floor cooling system + OA
ventilation using EnergyPlus. The model has been prepared as per the
specification of a published paper of a renowned Journal. The experimental
data of the test chamber as given in the paper has been matched with my
energyplus results. So, here are my queries:

1. Will this be considered as validation of the methodology used in the
software and now I can make changes in not only the HVAC system but also in
the building envelope as well. My concern is that, by changing the building
envelope and HVAC system do the results of my model be considered as
validated or not. Can anyone share the model result validation protocol. 

2. If I put DOAS in the same model with same envelope details and compare it
with other cooling systems for a particular climate does the model results
be considered as validated or not. In other words, can I make changes in the
HVAC system keeping envelope, schedules and other loads similar to the
original data and consider my model results to be validated or not.

In many cases what I have seen is that the models are validated using
experimental data but what if there is no experimental setup available, then
will this approach of using a published data from previous experiment to
validate your own modelling approach and then making desired parametric
changes to find results suffice or not?

 

Thanks,

 

With regards,

Sachin,

For building energy simulation programs validation protocols are like professional registration exams, you can only do a limited number of previously addressed/"solved" specific problems to "prove" competency to qualify to practice (and then subsequently step off the "academic" platform and into the larger world -- and do your best). Having said that, we are striving to take validation as far as we can.

I recommend the following as a starting point for studying validation methodology; and you can search on the authors at the "NREL publications data base" for more recent material. 

http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy06osti/40360.pdf

Also, an IEA research task had a study a while back relating to validating radiant system modeling

Message-ID: <0F18FC782AAB044BADF94EA196DF1261F7460E@exc03ahk1hk.asia.wspgroup.com>

Hi, everyone:

Below is an illustration of a EPW weather file, I'm trying very hard to
find out the description of each row. 

The main information I searched is :

1.       The wind speed reference height. 

2.       Every rows' meaning.

3.       Other numbers' meaning.

Someone told me that Energy Plus 's help files should include theses
information , I real find some climate information , but no detail
enough.

Could anyone take some light on this ?

Any suggestion should be appreciated. 

 

Thank you very much. 

Joey

Jiao,
I can not at the moment locate the header I had created for this process,
but have figured out the answer in the past. I had inconsistent wind data,
so created my own weather files using the process below. I seem to remember
finding the process of saving as text, then saving as csv cleared things up
a bit.. Hope this is sorta useful, and I will try to search an old computer
for the excel file that I made..

*Custom EPW

   1. Download closest EPW file
   2. Run and export INMBY
   3. Use weather file converter change EPW to CSV
   4. Open CSV in Notepad ++
   5. Remove header
   6. Save as text file
   7. Open in excel as comma delimited
   8. Cut wind column, and place into custom excel sheet for editing this
   file type
   9. Change all hours of the year by month to INMBY extrapolated data that
   have monthly averages over cut in speed.
   10. Export as CSV that says nameEPW.CSV
   11. Open EPW.CSV with notepad++
   12. Replace header with custom header
   13. Save as EPW.CSV
   14. Open in weather converter, convert to EPW
   15. Open new EPW file in weather file converter and generate stat file
   16. Save .STAT file, and .EPW file with same name, and place in same
   folder
   17. Open weather file in EP launch
   18. Open IDF design conditions file in IDF editor, replace data in
   Windspire.IDF with design conditions from Weather file converter GENERATED
   idf
   19. Edit IDF in text editor, to reflect the location
   20. Run simulation.

Hi Jiao,

If you go into auxiliary programs in the documentation folder in your
EnergyPlus install, on page 15/16 there is a discription of all the
variables in the weather file.

Karol,
   There is a program in the US called "Building America." The 
publications section of their website has some useful information.

http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/building_america/

I did a search on "latent gain household appliance" and got some 
promising looking results.
Kind regards,
  David

Hi Karol,

The standard assumptions we use for Building America research are detailed in the "Building America House Simulation Protocol" which can be downloaded directly from NREL's publications site here:
http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/49246.pdf

The document Morgan attached (Building America Benchmark) has been replaced by the above. 

We do revise these assumptions periodically based on newer research and you can always check http://www.buildingamerica.gov/ for the latest updates. 

Regards,
Dane

Sachin,

For building energy simulation programs validation protocols are like professional registration exams, you can only do a limited number of previously addressed/"solved" specific problems to "prove" competency to qualify to practice (and then subsequently step off the "academic" platform and into the larger world -- and do your best). Having said that, we are striving to take validation as far as we can.

I recommend the following as a starting point for studying validation methodology; and you can search on the authors at the "NREL publications data base" for more recent material.

http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy06osti/40360.pdf

Also, an IEA research task had a study a while back relating to validating radiant system modeling

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Model validation protocol

Hi,

This requires input from masters of energy modelling, so plz give suggestions!

I have modelled a test chamber with radiant floor cooling system + OA ventilation using EnergyPlus. The model has been prepared as per the specification of a published paper of a renowned Journal. The experimental data of the test chamber as given in the paper has been matched with my energyplus results. So, here are my queries:

1. Will this be considered as validation of the methodology used in the software and now I can make changes in not only the HVAC system but also in the building envelope as well. My concern is that, by changing the building envelope and HVAC system do the results of my model be considered as validated or not. Can anyone share the model result validation protocol.

2. If I put DOAS in the same model with same envelope details and compare it with other cooling systems for a particular climate does the model results be considered as validated or not. In other words, can I make changes in the HVAC system keeping envelope, schedules and other loads similar to the original data and consider my model results to be validated or not.

In many cases what I have seen is that the models are validated using experimental data but what if there is no experimental setup available, then will this approach of using a published data from previous experiment to validate your own modelling approach and then making desired parametric changes to find results suffice or not?

Thanks,

With regards,

??: Re: [Bldg-sim] Where can I get a description of the weather file?

 

Jiao, 

I can not at the moment locate the header I had created for this process, but have figured out the answer in the past. I had inconsistent wind data, so created my own weather files using the process below. I seem to remember finding the process of saving as text, then saving as csv cleared things up a bit.. Hope this is sorta useful, and I will try to search an old computer for the excel file that I made..

 

Custom EPW

1.	Download closest EPW file
2.	Run and export INMBY
3.	Use weather file converter change EPW to CSV
4.	Open CSV in Notepad ++
5.	Remove header
6.	Save as text file
7.	Open in excel as comma delimited 
8.	Cut wind column, and place into custom excel sheet for editing this file type
9.	Change all hours of the year by month to INMBY extrapolated data that have monthly averages over cut in speed.
10.	Export as CSV that says nameEPW.CSV
11.	Open EPW.CSV with notepad++
12.	Replace header with custom header
13.	Save as EPW.CSV
14.	Open in weather converter, convert to EPW
15.	Open new EPW file in weather file converter and generate stat file
16.	Save .STAT file, and .EPW file with same name, and place in same folder
17.	Open weather file in EP launch
18.	Open IDF design conditions file in IDF editor, replace data in Windspire.IDF with design conditions from Weather file converter GENERATED idf
19.	Edit IDF in text editor, to reflect the location
20.	Run simulation.

Hi, everyone:

Below is an illustration of a EPW weather file, I?m trying very hard to find out the description of each row. 

The main information I searched is :

1.       The wind speed reference height. 

2.       Every rows? meaning.

3.       Other numbers? meaning.

Someone told me that Energy Plus ?s help files should include theses information , I real find some climate information , but no detail enough.

Could anyone take some light on this ?

Any suggestion should be appreciated. 

 

Thank you very much.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Cold Storage
Message-ID: <4F75F44E.2070502@wichert.org>

This question has been asked before, but I can't actually find an answer 
anywhere.

The question is basically what simulation tool can be used to model cold 
storage?

A supermarket is a good example of cold storage.  I have read that 
EnergyPlus has numerous features to model supermarkets, including cold 
racks and lots more.  But I have also read that EnergyPlus is 
text-input-only and a graphical user interface is advisable.

I have never used EnergyPlus.  I have used EnergyPro and E-Quest.

Do any of you EnergyPlus gurus out there recommend EnergyPlus for 
supermarkets and further do you recommend a graphical interface?


Your thoughts are appreciated.

I thin k E-plus is your best fit. I don't think E-quest can do it because the minimum indoor temp can not be set below 55F. I have done something similar before in E-Plus and it worked fine.

So, it is supposed to have that capability, but some have been unable to 
get it to work.

Please know that there is a new file here:
http://energyplus.helpserve.com/
http://energyplus.helpserve.com/index.php?_m=downloads&_a=viewdownload&downloaditemid=112
That claims to be a new Refrigerated Cases Data Set saying "The file 
that was distributed with the EnergyPlus V7 install was flawed. This 
file has been corrected of those flaws."

But what about a graphical interface, is that needed?

Our experience in modeling cold warehouse 
especially to take into account the effect of the 
thermal mass of the storage was with ESPr and TRNSYS

It was not for energy performance validation but for design

We've played with the DOE-2.2R package, and did some preliminary 
modeling of a cold storage facility.  The program has some good 
capabilities and provided reasonable results when compared to actual 
utility data we had for the project.

An example refrigerated warehouse project is included with the install.

Dear Robert,

I am now preparing a model of a supermarket in E+ (for the first time J) and have most of the pieces in place.  So far, so good.

If you have not used E+ previously, you?ll be climbing a steep learning curve for the program itself in addition to using a fair number of the more sophisticated features ? consider carefully whether your schedule and budget allow it!

I use DesignBuilder v2 for the building geometry and materials ? and it works very well. The new version (v3) appears to be very powerful and may allow you to shorten that learning curve dramatically.  I don?t know if they?ve incorporated refrigerated casework?

 

p.s., Don?t underestimate the time and effort to corral all of the casework energy data.  In my 50,000 sq. ft. store there are over 50 pieces of casework on multiple refrigeration circuits, each of which has a unique COPs. Also, you must identify and quantify casework:

?         fan power

?         lighting power

?         anti-sweat heaters

?         sensible and latent case credits and 

?         defrost method, timing and energy source?. 

?         and if you are involved with a LEED project, the Proposed system will likely be different than Baseline.  

 

Whew!

I thin k E-plus is your best fit. I don't think E-quest can do it because the minimum indoor temp can not be set below 55F.  I have done something similar before in E-Plus and it worked fine.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Cold Storage

This question has been asked before, but I can't actually find an answer 
anywhere.

The question is basically what simulation tool can be used to model cold 
storage?

A supermarket is a good example of cold storage.  I have read that 
EnergyPlus has numerous features to model supermarkets, including cold 
racks and lots more.  But I have also read that EnergyPlus is 
text-input-only and a graphical user interface is advisable.

I have never used EnergyPlus.  I have used EnergyPro and E-Quest.

Do any of you EnergyPlus gurus out there recommend EnergyPlus for 
supermarkets and further do you recommend a graphical interface?


Your thoughts are appreciated.

YuXiang,
   TRNSYS uses the Mitalas method. I gather, however, that some work has 
been going on between the ?cole Polytechnique de Montr?al and the 
Germant TRNSYS developer (Transsolar) to update the method
Kind regards,
  David

Subject: [Bldg-sim] window U-value
Message-ID: <CAB_-mWPg-PRNruXf8q1P8cmOWhh4BQb6nEse_J6=pzrNrqabpg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear,

I am doing a sensitivity study and one of the parameters to adapt is the
U-value of the window. Is there a way to copy an existing window type (e.g.
2001 from w4-lib.dat) several times and consequently adapt its U-value only?

thanks,

Leen
