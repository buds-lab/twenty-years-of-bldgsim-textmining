Alec,

I don't know the NOAA address but I'm sure they still do

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200206280917.AA171262pd80000165855@gard.com>

All,

I need to evaluate the addition of light shelves to an existing DOE-2.1E-133 model. I'm interested in the effect that the light shelves will have on both heat transfer through the glazing and on daylighting controls. 

Can light shelves be modeled in DOE-2.1E or must this analysis be performed outside of the model? If anyone has experience modeling light shelves in DOE-2.1E, I would appreciate any suggestions.

Thanks,

James

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200206271605.AA052310pd80000165571@gard.com>

Hello,

I need some help with modelling Radiant floor heat in slab on grade from a natural gas boiler with an air-cooled chiller/AHU both for the same thermal zone.  When I put the thermal zone on the AHU, the cooling coil shows up on the chilled water loop but not the boiler loop.  When I put the thermal zone on the radiant slab, it shows on the hot water loop but not the chilled water loop.  I can't get the radiant floor to show on the heating side of the AHU as an alternate heat source, but I'm not allowed to have the same thermal zone on two different systems.  Can anyone please help me?

Thank you.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200206260450.AA502470pd80000164938@gard.com>

Hello,

I would very much appreciate your thoughts on a few questions I have
relating to building simulation programs. Specifically:

1. Are there any commercial EnergyPlus interfaces now available? The
EnergyPlus website suggests that several are being developed for release as
early as mid-2002 (i.e., now), but I have been unable to find any
information about them.
2. Are there any building simulation programs/add-ons that incorporate
daylighting analysis? Alternately, is there any compatability between
programs like EnergyPlus/TRNSYS and Radiance?
3. For whole-building (energy) analysis of window systems, are TRNSYS and
EnergyPlus best used separately or in combination? I?d be interested in
your experience with these programs, particularly as they relate to
modeling applications focused on window systems.

Thanks for your help.

Sincerely / Med venlig hilsen / Mit freundlichen Gr??en,

Hello,

We are a company based in Chennai, India with middleware products targeted
for building simulation and automation industry as one of the verticals.

We would like to understand how the simulation industry uses CORBA for 
interoperable/distributed building simulation and automation. In particular
we are interested in information relating to building simulation in 
environments that are a combinations of building simulation and emulation.

Pointers to relevant information will be greatly appreciated. Sorry, if 
this is a faq !

Actually, all the variables get reported in the .eso file.  But the post 
processing program will limit its creation of the .csv file to 254 
variables, due to Excel's limititation of same.  So, what you could do is a 
more targeted request to the post processing program (ReadVarsESO) and use 
the created .eso file.

This program is described in both the Output Details document and in the 
InputOutput Reference document (I think).  You can give it a list of just 
the variables you want -- if you give it nothing it tries to report on the 
entire set of variables in the .eso file and probably runs into the limit.

Though you are looking for surface variables, I think, if you were looking 
for meter variables (Report Meter), the .mtr file that gets saved can also 
be run from the post processing program (I think we do it automatically) 
and is usually a lot less individual variables.

In order to do this, you will have to use the Command mode or MS-DOS mode 
rather than use EP-Launch or other methods.

Hope this helps.

Linda

Linda,

YOu seem to be working on a Sunday, since u responded immediately to my
membership request. If you happen to read this email today and have the
time to reply to it, can you please tell me if there is a solution to my
problem.

I have requested for about totally 64 report variables (where each
variable is duplicated to follow two different schedules.) These are
multiplied when each variable is applied to each surface of different
zones. While the simulation works, it reports only the first 254
variables. My model gets more complicated with more surfaces - than the
current simulation. I was wondering if there is some way to have a report
of all the variables, apart from simply deleting the reported variables in
the input file and running the simulation again.

thanks a lot

Hi,
I get an error message in PowerDoe
: Pump: DEFAULT-CW-PUMP is not attached to any
equipment. 

In the model, there is already a pump assigned to the
CW loop. Everytime I delete this default pump the
simulation runs without error but when I open the
model again this Default-CW-Pump is created by the
program.

Pl let me know how to resolve this problem. 

The BDL file creates the following entry:


"CW Loop" = CIRCULATION-LOOP
     *7255 *    LIBRARY-ENTRY "DEFAULT-CW"
     *   1 * $LIBRARY-ENTRY DEFAULT-CW                
     CIRCULATION-LOOPStarting Points
     *   2 *  TYPE = CW    LOOP-PUMP = DEFAULT-CW-PUMP
   ..
     *   1 * $LIBRARY-ENTRY DEFAULT-CW-PUMP           
     PUMP            Starting Points
     *   2 *  FLOW-RATIO 1.1  HEAD-RATIO 1.1      ..
     *7256 *    LOOP-PUMP        = "CW PUMP"

Hi,

I was wondering if there is a database which explains or defines the
output variables in Energy Plus.

Secondly, when I add a schedule name in my report variables sub group I
get the following error:

Program Version,EnergyPlus 1.0.1.042, 6/21/02 9:47 AM
   ** Severe  ** Schedule MAR1 has missing days in its schedule pointers
   ** Severe  ** Schedule JUN1 has missing days in its schedule pointers
   **  Fatal  ** Preceding Errors during Schedule Input Processing cause
termination.
   ************* EnergyPlus Terminated--Fatal Error Detected. 0 Warning; 2
Severe Errors

A sample of my schedule input and my report variables is given below. If
anyone can identify, the reason for this error, please let me know.

thank you very much

Subject:  Building Energy Software Survey

The U.S. Department of Energy is conducting a web-based 
survey of users of government-sponsored building simulation 
programs. The survey is directed at users of EnergyPlus, 
ENERGY-10, DOE-2 and BLAST.  The goal is to find out how 
much these programs are being used and what features you 
would like to see added to them.  

Please try your hand at the survey by visiting 

   http://SimulationResearch.lbl.gov/ 

then click on "Survey" at the top of the left menu. 

The survey takes only a few minutes to complete and your 
responses will influence future program enhancements, 
especially to EnergyPlus and ENERGY-10, which are still 
under development.  

Thanks in advance from the EnergyPlus, ENERGY-10, DOE-2 and 
BLAST development teams, and from Dru Crawley, DOE Program 
Manager for Building Energy Tools Development.

I created a window gas material using the inbuilt option of "air" for the
gas instead of customizing it. The way I understand the program, I do not
need to enter values for conductivity, viscosity and specific heat
coeeficients and molecular weight. However my program terminates with the
following errors. Does anyone know why this happens. I have pasted the
input file in here, i am sorry, its very long.

thanks a lot

The capability to model a water/water chiller/heat-pump was recently added to DOE-2.2, Version 41.  This chiller can be coupled with the floor panel system to approximate the radiant floor,  and either a ground-loop heat-exchanger or a lake/well/sea to provide the source of heat.

  Dear collegues,
  Does anyone knows if it is possible to simulate a water/water Heat Pump 
  connected to a radiant floor (for heating and cooling)with DOE2.1 (doeplus). 
  More: 
  can I provide a water temperature schedule (water from the sea)?
  can I also suppose to have a ground heat exchanger for the HP?
  Thanks in advance.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200206111516.AA162898pd80000159305@gard.com>

Dear colleagues,

A lot of new information to tell you about EnergyPlus.

1. Building Energy Analysis Tools Survey.
We are conducting a web-based survey of energy simulation tool users to
find out how much energy simulation
is being used and what features users think are most important for near-
and long-term development.
Please try your hand at the survey by visiting
http://SimulationResearch.lbl.gov/  then click on "Survey"
in the left menu. The survey takes only a few minutes to complete and your
responses will influence
future program enhancements.  Your responses are completely confidential.

2. New, Version 1.0.1 EnergyPlus Now Available.
A new version of EnergyPlus was released in late April and is available for
download from the EnergyPlus
web site  (http://www.energyplus.gov).  Version 1.0.1 contains many new
features including:
extensive end-use meters, auto sizing of system components and equipment,
Trombe wall, photovoltaic
calculations (link to TRNSYS), new window-related features (blinds,
controls, data import from Window 5,
interior window solar radiation, movable slats, mixtures of gases,
triangular windows), many new input file
examples and HVAC system templates, continuous extensive testing, movable
transparent wall insulation,
and many more!

3. Weather Data for >550 Locations Worldwide Available for EnergyPlus.
The EnergyPlus web site also now includes weather data for more than 550
locations around the world --
more than 300 in North America with the other 200 in 70 other countries.
Check out the list of available
weather files at:
http://www.eren.doe.gov/buildings/energy_tools/energyplus/energyplus_weatherdata.html

4. Progress on User Interfaces for EnergyPlus.
The most asked questions are 'Where is the interface?' and 'When will
commercial interfaces be available?'.
We are pleased to announce that we expect the first interface to be
available later this summer.  Also tools to
make using EnergyPlus easier--although it's not a full user-friendly
interface--are now available.  Check
out these two web site for more information:
http://www.deringergroup.com/Software/EPlusTools.htm
and  http://www.tse-inc.net/epi.htm .   We will also announce the
availability of user interfaces and tools as
they become available on the EnergyPlus web site.  Note that at least 5
other organizations have indicated
that they plan to develop user interfaces over the next year or so.

Thanks in advance,

Dru Crawley
Program Manager, Building Energy  Tools

More:
1)The ground-loop heat exchanger for the HP is also allowable for this case?
2)It is possible to provide a water temperature schedule (water from the sea)?

Yes, EnergyPlus will calculate beam solar radiation entering an exterior
window in a zone and then passing through interior windows in the zone to
adjacent zone(s). It does this by tracking where beam solar radiation
falls inside the primary zone. It will also apportion some of the diffuse
solar entering an exterior window to interior window(s). However,
daylighting through interior windows is not calculated.

Yes, but only if you select Solar Distribution =  
FullInteriorAndExterior (in the BUILDING object).  With this option 
selected, direct sunlight is projected into the space onto the other 
zone surfaces.  If this option is not selected, then all direct 
sunlight entering the space is projected onto the floor surfaces.  
Use of this option requires that the zone be a completely enclosed 
convex volume.  EnergyPlus will also transmit sunlight from one zone 
into another through a window placed on an interior wall.  This may 
be the configuration you have with your double-skin facade.

There are two main sources of design day data.  In the 
EnergyPlus\DataSets folder, the file BLASTDesignDays.idf contains 
dozens of design day definitions for primarily U.S. locations which 
are already in EnergyPlus format.  For other locations, data is 
available in the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals, Chapter 27.

You need to do both.  The inside convection algorithm applies to the 
interior surface of every wall (not to the inside of wall cavities).  
So, your trombe space of the double skin space needs to be treated as 
a separate zone.  Understand, though, that it may not be possible 
with current features to truly represent your double-skin facade, 
depending on how it is configured.

Windows are the only objects which can transmit sunlight.  So, a 
glass wall is created by placing a window wall so that the window 
covers nearly the entire wall (it is true that there must be a small 
nonzero area of wall left over).  For curtainwalls, however, you may 
have opaque sections as well as window sections.  For this case, 
specify the base wall as having glass as it's exerior layer, and then 
size the windows to cover just the light-transmitting section of the 
curtainwall.  Note that the opaque glass layer must be 
MATERIAL:REGULAR, not MATERIAL:WINDOWGLASS.

The EnergyPlus *.rdd file lists all available output variables for a 
given idf file.  Since the heat gain into a zone is going to depend 
on the zone temperature, you need to control the zone to the desired 
setpoint.  The simplest way to do this is in EnergyPlus is with 
"purchased air" which is essentially an infinite source of hot or 
cold air.  The purchased air "system" will report total heating and 
cooling loads for the space.  For component loads, such as the heat 
gain just through a window, see the *.rdd file for a list of 
reportable components.

Jason et al;

For California, there is a database of cities and the corresponding climate zone mapping.  Each climate zone has an approved weather file for performing energy code compliance calculations.  These files are in WYEC2 format (but no illuminance data).

I have attached the MS Excel file that maps 600 California cities to their appropriate climate zone.  This file was exported from the "City List" table in the California Non-Residential New Construction [NRNC] Characteristics Database.  This database has a publication ID # of 3522, and can be found on the CALMAC (California DSM Measurement Advisory Committee) website - http://www.calmac.org.

Selecting the most appropriate weather file is not always 
straight forward.  I usually look for the weather file that 
is geographically close and still has about the same CDD 
and HDD as the building location.  I would like to make 
this process as easy as possible for people using some 
software I'm developing.

Does anyone have a database that would relate something 
that most people know about their location in the US (such 
as a zip code or state/county) to the appropriate weather 
file to use for building simulation (such as TMY2 or WYEC)? 
How about a location to design data?

One more resource that you might add to your list is the GWDS (Global
Weather Data Sources) that is the result of ASHRAE's research project
1170-RP, completed in June 2001.  It's on the web and has a neat little
GUI that was developed by NCDC for ASHRAE.  It is only available to
ASHRAE members by logging onto the ASHRAE home page
(http//:www.ashrae.org), then clicking a shortcut to Technical
Committees, then selecting T.C.-4.2 (Weather Information), then the
ASHRAE weather data products, and finally 1170-RP.  This will link you
to NCDC's GWDS site, which cannot be accessed except through ASHRAE.

This web site tells you what sorts of weather data are available at
about one-hundred international sites, along with the full address and
contact info on how to obtain the data.  The web site does not contain
actual weather data.

I thought there might be enough ASHRAE members on the BLDG-SIM list that
could benefit from this.  Even non-members of ASHRAE could find the
1170-RP final report to be useful.  The report lists at least 72
contacts names and addresses, 92 international weather data web sites,
and 15 more web sites just on solar radiation.  NCDC maintains the site
and intends to keep the site dynamic by updating the data as such become
available.

is geographically close and still has about the same CDD 
and HDD as the building location.  I would like to make 
this process as easy as possible for people using some 
software I'm developing.

Does anyone have a database that would relate something 
that most people know about their location in the US (such 
as a zip code or state/county) to the appropriate weather 
file to use for building simulation (such as TMY2 or WYEC)? 
How about a location to design data?

The BLDG-SIM mailing list has always been a good forum for 
questions about how to find weather data for use with 
building energy simulation programs.  I pulled together 
some of sources that I know about and found URLs.  Please 
see:

  http://www.gard.com/weather/

It is not a very exhaustive list, I know it could be much 
more comprehensive.  I'm hoping for your help to add to it. 
If you have additional resources, please e-mail them to me 
with a short description and an URL and I'll add them to 
the page.  

In the past we have gotten questions about Russia, Italy, 
England, Poland, Germany, Israel, Portugal, Morocco, China, 
Argentina, Spain, Lebanon, Netherlands, Canada, United 
States and probably a few that I missed.  If you asked and 
got an answer about these locations or are the one that 
answered a message about them, please forward the e-mail 
with the source to me.

Thanks

I am working on a simulation in energy plus and have a few questions.

The rpt weather file does not provide all weather information such as
barometric pressure for design days, snow reflectance, etc. Where
can one get this information.

Secondly, I am studying heat performance of a double skin envelope in
comparision to a single glass surface. Would it be recommended to use the
trombe wall for the inside convection algorithm for the double skin or is
it better to create the airspace as a second zone?

Thirdly, the program prevents me from creating a glass wall and a
window has to be part of a wall. Its surface area cannot be equal to
the wall surface. Has anyone tried modeling a curtain wall
or something similar? How have you circumvented this?

Thank you
Shefali Modi
