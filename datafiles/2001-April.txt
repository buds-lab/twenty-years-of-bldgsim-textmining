Mailing List Members,

We are currently experiencing problems with e-mail being 
sent to the gard.com domain including mailing lists.  We 
have been connecting to the internet through a DSL 
connection provided in part by Northpoint Communications.  
On March 23, they declared bankruptcy and on March 29 our 
internet connection was terminated.  Since then, we have re-
established some e-mail functionality.  Currently, some but 
not all e-mail is arriving to the gard.com mail server via 
a standard modem.  The software we are using for this 
temporary connection will probably not support mailing 
lists so it will take longer to get the mailing lists 
working again.  I will send out another message when I can 
get the mailing lists up again.   I apologize for this 
interruption in service.

Our web site will not be effected since it is hosted with 
another provider.  If you need to contact me you can try by 
e-mail or just give me a call.

Thanks

Jason
