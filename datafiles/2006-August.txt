All,
 
Correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that there was a rumor that both

In-Reply-To: <MDAEMON-F200608301118.AA1818562pd80002070147@gard.com>
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200608311234.AA3420703pd80001224108@gard.com>

All,
 
We have been working with Brandon on the issues he has been having with
the ABS-gbXML-GBS-DOE-2.2-eQuest process flow and would like to note a
few items for clarity.
 
1. The DOE-2 and EnergyPlus files created by GBS are exact translations
of what is in the gbXML file exported by the CAD application. No
surfaces are added, modified, or moved.  The "misplaced" roof Jeff
mentions is actually a ceiling surface that has been exported as a roof
surface from ABS, and we have encouraged Brandon to report the issue to
Autodesk who is aggressively working on any issues with their gbXML
export that are reported to them by their users.
 
2. Jeff and I have spoken about the issues of viewing GBS created DOE-2
files in eQuest's 2D views and have agreed to work together to find a
solution.  The issue in a nut shell, eQuest's 2D plan view relies on
horizontal planar polygons that represent the space boundary and a
planar polygon to represent the bounding story polygon to draw the
spaces and story. That is the primary purpose of these two polygons
(space and floor) as they are not required by DOE-2 for the energy
analysis. A real world example of this horizontal planar polygon
limitation is a theatre floor or a lecture auditorium that have curved
or angled floors that currently can not be viewed in eQuest's 2D view.
The curved or angled floors are represented in gbXML as they are seen in
the CAD application and the resulting GBS created DOE-2.2 files. We have
designed our gbXML to DOE-2 translation for these real world scenarios.
 
3. gbXML does have a volumetric space representation, one that is fully
3D. The vast majority of CAD applications do not have 3D space/room
objects that can capture a curvatous room that you may find in a Gehry
building design with walls tilted outward (that is why Gehry went with
Catia a mechanical design CAD application).  The CAD vendors are rapidly
expanding their tool's capabilities to have fully 3D space objects.
DOE-2, eQuest, or EnergyPlus have no 3D volumetric space objects.
 
One of the tests we recommend CAD vendors conduct in testing their gbXML
export is a sphere. The link below is to such a sphere that has been
translated to DOE-2 by GBS and is viewed in eQuest's 3D view. This
spherical space can not be viewed in eQuest's 2D view, as it would be
too great of a simplification to represent the curved floor with one
planar polygon as eQuest currently requires for its 2D view. It would
also be very difficult programmatically and error prone to automatically
determine where the 2D planar polygon should be.
 
http://development.greenbuildingstudio.com/images/equestsphere.jpg
 
Though none of what I said above will help Brandon's issue today, I
think his feedback to Autodesk, Green Building Studio, and Jeff will
ensure that our next or future updates and versions meet his real needs.
 
Lastly, today the vast majority of energy modeling requires hours of
human interpretation of drawings and CAD models to build the energy
model. In this process, human interpretation makes apprenticed judgments
to simplify the model given the budgetary and time constraints of the
project. The CAD vendors are pushing the envelope to automate this
process to provide geometrically accurate thermal models of the building
as they are represented in their tools. They have made great progress
and are fine tuning the exceptions as they are reported, so very soon we
can shelve our architectural scales as slide rulers were many decades
ago.
 
I look forward to that day!

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] gbXML CAD data into eQuest?


All,
 
Recently I have been successful on a number of projects exporting gbXML
building geometry from CAD (Autodesk Building Systems 2007) and
importing into version 6 of Trace 700 and version 4.3 of Carrier HAP.  
 
Have also tried sending the gbXML to Green Building Studio and
downloading the DOE-2 file they create in an effort to import this data
expeditiously into eQuest.  Unfortunately the DOE-2 file created by
Green Building studio is problematic for use in eQuest -- Jeff Hirsch
has looked at one made the following evaluation:
 
It appears that the ACad -> gbXML software creates a building model that
is not easily used in eQUEST and cannot ever be used in the eQUEST
wizard, only in the detail mode. Since it uses an "Energy Plus" style of
input model description (i.e; surface geometry but no floor plan or
space layout) it is not really compatible with eQUEST for detail
envelope or space/zone modification without some difficulty ... since
you cannot use eQUEST 2-d view (the primary way of identifying and
modifying space/zone data.)

Also, the building geometry is not correct and is difficult to really
confirm in eQUEST ... all the interior and exterior walls extend outside
the roof or the roofs are misplaced at Z low by a couple feet.

Since the creation process does not create any space (room geometry) but
only physically places walls at the site relative the location of the
building on the earth (i.e, it does not geometrically describe the
spaces so that they can be viewed in 2- and 3- dimensions, checking the
placement of walls is not possible (but there are visual problems such
as the wall height I mentioned earlier.)

 
Does anyone know of an expeditious way to transfer gbXML geometry data
into eQuest accurately -- being able use the wizards I could live
without, so long as space / zone modification possible in detail edit
mode.  Or alternatively, does anyone know if gbXML import is "in the
works" for a future version of eQuest?
 
Thanks

Yes, we spent many hours modelling radiant systems and invested a great
deal of finance. The results have been somewhat published in papers by
Gaw, Ruess, Holst and Simmonds, also Bjarne Olesen and Meirhans have
published work on active concrete. There are also other publications
such as Markus Kochenz. EMPA were Kochenz used to work has also
published data on controlling radiant floors. Night flushing has also
been reported by Braun and Simmonds.

Real buildings up and running are Bangkok airport, 199 Fremont in San
Francisco, Akron Art Museum, Water and life in Hemet (CA), the Groninger
Museum ( the paper written on this project explains exactly what you are
looking at) and a few more.

Good Luck and use TRNSYS.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Radiant floor cooling and increased capacity with
thicker slab

 

I'm looking into improving the overall efficiency of a radiant cooling

system by increasing the slab thickness 1-2 inches below the tubing and

using night cooling to charge the slab.  Currently, we have 5/8" tubing

fastened to a layer of insulation on grade and 4" of concrete poured on

top.  Ideally, if we can significantly reduce the need for cooling in

the morning for a few hours and even reduce the peak cooling load at 5pm

during the day, then we will definitely look further into this strategy.

Has anyone modeled this or better yet have experience with this on a

project and seen the benefits?

 

Thanks

2.	I lowered the plenum height as much as possible but not to the 6 foot level as eQuest does not allow windows in the plenum zones.
3.	I used a VAV system, not a CV system as suggested below since there would be a heating coil with a damper to reduce the air flow at the zones.

All,

 

Thanks for the responses on yesterday's question, 'simulating a VAV without cooling coil'.  A reasonable result was obtained by using a DX coil and setting the capacity to 1.  Believe I tried sending it to zero prior, but this as I now understand invoked autosizing.

 

Today I'd like to take a conventional VAV system with cooling and model its performance in a displacement ventilation (DV) configuration.  OUr 'typical school' DV does not require underfloor air distribution, so were not worried about accounting for any radiant effect.  I've read (well, skimmed) the Addison-Nall paper and they seem to explain the issues sufficiently, but didn't see anything in there I could explicitly apply to developing a DV model with eQuest.

 

Here is what Trane has to say about modeling displacement ventilation systems using Trace 700 (wherever they say 'underfloor' read 'displacement'):

*	The air in a space supplied by an underfloor system is stratified and you only need enough airflow to handle the temperature (loads) in the lower stratified region. Trace (as well as the rest of the simulation programs) assumes well mixed spaces with the same temperature at all locations.
*	The way to handle this is to model the lower portion (the bottom 6 ft or so) as the height in the space. The top portion is then modeled by calling it a plenum space (plenum of about 5 or 6 feet). Then create custom miscellaneous loads and assign a portion of them to the plenum. The same thing can be done with the lights. 
*	As for the system side, choose a Constant Volume Variable Temperature system. Go to the Temp/Humidity tab and assign a Leaving Cooling Coil Min and Max temperature of 55?F. Under the Direct/Indirect Humidification Controls, select "CV Mixed Air Bypass with Wild Coil Leaving Temp". 
*	This will cause the temp off the coil to be low dewpoint, then air will be bypassed around main cooling coil and reintroduced and mixed back in after the main CC, which will allow the air to be supplied to the space with a reasonable %RH at a higher temperature (60-65?F).

When everything is working right, for equivalent space loads and equipment the DV model should allow a higher supply temperature (60-65?) and thus perform with measurably greater number hours of economizer operation than the conventional overhead distribution system.  

 

Does anyone have a similar checklist or reference to Trane's for doing a DV model in eQuest?  After having attended a one-day eQuest seminar, I am familiar with parameters.  But I'm not at all clear on how to assign say two thirds of the lighting load to a parameter, and transfer it to the exhaust air.

 

 

 

Thanks

Subject: How to simulate VAV systems without cooling coils in eQuest

All,

 

 

In the northwest USA we often use VAV systems without cooling for schools -- 100% outside air economizer cooling, and 'off' for three months in the summer.  The particular system I want to model in eQuest is the standard VAV with heat recovery, but I can't figure how to either define it without a cooling coil, or render the cooling coil and chiller ineffective.

 

What is the best way to do this?

 

 

Thanks

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] gbXML CAD data into eQuest?
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200608301118.AA1818671pd80001222309@gard.com>

All,
 
Recently I have been successful on a number of projects exporting gbXML
building geometry from CAD (Autodesk Building Systems 2007) and
importing into version 6 of Trace 700 and version 4.3 of Carrier HAP.  
 
Have also tried sending the gbXML to Green Building Studio and
downloading the DOE-2 file they create in an effort to import this data
expeditiously into eQuest.  Unfortunately the DOE-2 file created by
Green Building studio is problematic for use in eQuest -- Jeff Hirsch
has looked at one made the following evaluation:
 
It appears that the ACad -> gbXML software creates a building model that
is not easily used in eQUEST and cannot ever be used in the eQUEST
wizard, only in the detail mode. Since it uses an "Energy Plus" style of
input model description (i.e; surface geometry but no floor plan or
space layout) it is not really compatible with eQUEST for detail
envelope or space/zone modification without some difficulty ... since
you cannot use eQUEST 2-d view (the primary way of identifying and
modifying space/zone data.)

Also, the building geometry is not correct and is difficult to really
confirm in eQUEST ... all the interior and exterior walls extend outside
the roof or the roofs are misplaced at Z low by a couple feet.

Since the creation process does not create any space (room geometry) but
only physically places walls at the site relative the location of the
building on the earth (i.e, it does not geometrically describe the
spaces so that they can be viewed in 2- and 3- dimensions, checking the
placement of walls is not possible (but there are visual problems such
as the wall height I mentioned earlier.)

 
Does anyone know of an expeditious way to transfer gbXML geometry data
into eQuest accurately -- being able use the wizards I could live
without, so long as space / zone modification possible in detail edit
mode.  Or alternatively, does anyone know if gbXML import is "in the
works" for a future version of eQuest?
 
Thanks

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] eQUEST v.3.6 - Hot Water Loop Heating Capacity Different from Plant Size
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200608301114.AA1404562pd80001222302@gard.com>

Hello all, I am simulating an H-shaped, 13 story, 600,000 square foot,
50+ year old office building in Seattle, WA with the core zones served
by a dual-duct system and the perimeter zones served by a 4-pipe fan
coil system. The systems run 24 hours a day with no setback. eQUEST
reports an air handler summary heating design load of 39.6 Btuh/sf which
appears within reason for this type of setup.

My concern is the discrepancy between Hot Water Loop Heating Capacity in
the PV-A report vs. the Hot Water Loop Peak Net Load in the PS-D report.
The PV-A Circulation Loop Heating Capacity number is -23.700 MBTU/HR,
which corresponds with the 39.6 Btuh/sf reported under the Air-Side HVAC
Summary sheet. In the PS-D report, the Hot Water Loop Peak Net Load is
-8774.2 KBTU/HR, which is 37% of the value in PV-A. The PS-C, Equipment
Loads and Energy Use report also agrees with PS-D, showing the boiler
peak Heat Load at -8774.2 KBTU/HR, with hours of operation showing up in
all part load ranges, totaling 8,595 hours of operation per year (due to
the reheat system and 24 hour operation).

Am I understanding correctly that the -23.7 MBTU/HR is a peak connected
load (sum of the air handler/zone heating coils), but that the hot water
boiler plant will see only a peak of -8774.2 KBTU/HR because of
diversity? Any insight would be much appreciate.

pretty much same as what I do except for the loads (lighting, people, and equipment) allocation to the plenum. 
It is very straighforward, if you have plenum zones. Just decide how much load goes to the plenum and input it under the equipment/light/people tab. You have to first assign a schedule so that the w/sqft numbers can be entered. For the people load, one thing to keep in mind is the outside air, if it is based on cfm/person. The plenum people do not get counted, so you will have to add extra cfm to the conditioned zone people.

the conventional overhead distribution system.  

 

Does anyone have a similar checklist or reference to Trane's for doing a DV
model in eQuest?  After having attended a one-day eQuest seminar, I am
familiar with parameters.  But I'm not at all clear on how to assign say two
thirds of the lighting load to a parameter, and transfer it to the exhaust
air.

Subject: How to simulate VAV systems without cooling coils in eQuest

All,

 

 

In the northwest USA we often use VAV systems without cooling for schools --
100% outside air economizer cooling, and 'off' for three months in the
summer.  The particular system I want to model in eQuest is the standard VAV
with heat recovery, but I can't figure how to either define it without a
cooling coil, or render the cooling coil and chiller ineffective.

 

What is the best way to do this?

 

 

Thanks

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200608291812.AA121400pd80001221303@gard.com>

All,
 
Thanks for the responses on yesterday's question, 'simulating a VAV without cooling coil'.  A reasonable result was obtained by using a DX coil and setting the capacity to 1.  Believe I tried sending it to zero prior, but this as I now understand invoked autosizing.
 
Today I'd like to take a conventional VAV system with cooling and model its performance in a displacement ventilation (DV) configuration.  OUr 'typical school' DV does not require underfloor air distribution, so were not worried about accounting for any radiant effect.  I've read (well, skimmed) the Addison-Nall paper and they seem to explain the issues sufficiently, but didn't see anything in there I could explicitly apply to developing a DV model with eQuest.
 
Here is what Trane has to say about modeling displacement ventilation systems using Trace 700 (wherever they say 'underfloor' read 'displacement'):

*	The air in a space supplied by an underfloor system is stratified and you only need enough airflow to handle the temperature (loads) in the lower stratified region. Trace (as well as the rest of the simulation programs) assumes well mixed spaces with the same temperature at all locations.
*	The way to handle this is to model the lower portion (the bottom 6 ft or so) as the height in the space. The top portion is then modeled by calling it a plenum space (plenum of about 5 or 6 feet). Then create custom miscellaneous loads and assign a portion of them to the plenum. The same thing can be done with the lights. 
*	As for the system side, choose a Constant Volume Variable Temperature system. Go to the Temp/Humidity tab and assign a Leaving Cooling Coil Min and Max temperature of 55?F. Under the Direct/Indirect Humidification Controls, select "CV Mixed Air Bypass with Wild Coil Leaving Temp". 
*	This will cause the temp off the coil to be low dewpoint, then air will be bypassed around main cooling coil and reintroduced and mixed back in after the main CC, which will allow the air to be supplied to the space with a reasonable %RH at a higher temperature (60-65?F).

When everything is working right, for equivalent space loads and equipment the DV model should allow a higher supply temperature (60-65?) and thus perform with measurably greater number hours of economizer operation than the conventional overhead distribution system.  
 
Does anyone have a similar checklist or reference to Trane's for doing a DV model in eQuest?  After having attended a one-day eQuest seminar, I am familiar with parameters.  But I'm not at all clear on how to assign say two thirds of the lighting load to a parameter, and transfer it to the exhaust air.

Hi Daniel:

So many issues.

Are you allowing the cooling coil(s) to reset to the
warmest zone load? Otherwise, I believe your cooling
coil remains at 55?F.

Nothing to do with the economizer, in my view.

Also, is your thermostat REVERSE-ACTION? There are
those that under stand these controls better than I,
but this allows the VAV box to back open in the
winter, when heating is needed.

Try these items.

Hello,

 

I'm modeling a multistory office building located in New York using eQUEST.
The building has a heated basement (no cooling) and six conditioned floors
(heating and cooling). Cooling is done via air-cooled DX units and a packaged
VAV with reheat distribution system. Heating is done using boilers and a hot
water loop feeding the reheat coils in the VAV box and baseboards along the
perimeter. The schedules are eQUEST defaults. I am not sure what I am doing
wrong, but I am getting a significant cooling load in winter. I am using OA
temperature controlled economizer and compressor lock-out.

 

One other strange thing that happens with this model is that both fan energy
and demand go up in the winter. One should think that in the heating mode the
airflow is set to minimum and the temperature is varied to meet the load.
Therefore the fan energy and demand should be lower in the winter. However,
the numbers I am seeing show that the demand for the fans is about 50% higher
in the winter and the fans energy use in January is almost 4 times higher than
the one in August. I have played with the night controls for the fans, but
that does not help. If I select the "Stay Off" control instead of "Cycle On
Any" I am getting rid of the cooling in the winter, but I am getting weird
heating numbers in the summer. In June and August I get some gas use (???) for
space heating, but none in July. I do not know what I am missing, but this
does not seem right.

 

Did anyone encounter these or similar issues? Any input will be highly
appreciated. Please let me know if you need more details.

 

Thank you,

Dan

Put these loads, with profiles, in the Equipment of an
unconditioned zone. eQUEST has a lot of open space to
define electric loads. Just be aware of where you put
it, if you need to extract it from output later.

Brandon,
 
You could set your capcities to zero. However, if this is for a LEED model, beware of the fact that ASHRAE 90.1 (1999 or 2004, take your pick) requires you to model a code equivalent system whenever a cooling or heating system does not exist in the actual design. In order to minimize the impact on your overall energy consumption you could set schedules for the summer months in which the temperature of the building is allowed to increase to limits not acceptable during the normal conditioning hours, turn fans off, and alter the fraction/multiplier for internal loads such as lighting and misc equipment. This would be a truly representative case as less lighting, computers, etc will be active.

Since eQUEST combined SYSTEM and PLANT into HVAC, if a
chiller is inadequate to satisfy load, space
temperatures go up.

Try setting the coiling coil to 55?F, and allow it to
modulate with OSA. Make it a package unit, and give it
a zero EER. But still include your reheat coils.

See if that works.

Has anyone tried to model the Mitsubishi City Multi Heat Pump system in

guess would be to model it as a WLHP and remove all the pumps.  Any ideas

Hi Scott:

Let's take these in order. And by the way, if you have
used the software only once before, all I will be
describing is in the Detailed Interface Mode, after
you have generally created your building.

Make sure you have done everything in the Wizard Mode
you want. If you make inputs within the Detailed
Interface Mode, going back to a Wizard will erase
these changes:

1) Chiller heat - All heat generating loads are to be
shown in the LOADS portion of your model. If the
chiller is in a particular space (ZONE), you simply
won't put this heat generating load in the space.

You will put the chiller in the PLANT module, and the
program will not care where the chiller is actually
located.

2) In the HVAC section, you can go to the particular
ZONES that will have exhaust fans, and input them
there.

3) Electric Unit heaters - Likewise, on the HVAC
module level, you would input BASEBOARD heating (if
separate from the main HVAC system), or input a Unit
Heater system here as well.

4) Air Rotation Units - I am unfamiliar with this
term. If you mean Fan Filter Units, such as are in
silicon wafer manufacturing, you can simply account
for the electric load in LOADS, unless there is a coil
attached to the unit. Then, I believe, a 4-PIPE
INDUCTION system must be chosen, with the secondary
coil load in the FFUs.

Consult someone who HAS used this software within you
area, as it sounds like you make need help in the
Detailed Interface area.

Hope this gets you started.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Equest- Central Energy Plant
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200608280859.AA5901656pd80001218869@gard.com>

For our LEED credit, we are using equest to model a central energy
plant. I am inexperienced in the central energy plant area, and I have
used this software only once before.

 

Any help is most appreciated:

 

1)     If I am cooling certain portions of the plant, how do I make sure
that the heat generated by the chillers is not contributing to that
building load. I have louvers and a fan venting the chiller areas. If
the building sees the heat by the chillers, then obviously, I'm never
going to achieve my goal of energy reduction in the cooling department.
I've read about setting the tstat for no cooling or heating, but am
unsure if this is the right way to do it and where exactly on the
screens to input this.

 

2)     How do I account for exhaust fans in specified zones?

 

3)     How Do I account for electric unit heaters in specified zones?

 

4)     How do I account for Air Rotation Units in specified zones?

 

 

 

Thanks in advance for your help.

Contact the Brisbane MET office and they should be able to arrange a long history for $10-40.  They may even be able to give you a historical average / typical year though the defnition of this may be different from what you want and what they produce.  DOE2.com's websit also has the Brisbane airport TRY file in BIN format which if you accept the TRY year as 'average' then you can extract the WBT's.

  Hello All,

  I require average hourly statistics (Jan-Dec) for wet bulb temperatures (?C or ?F) of Brisbane, Australia. I tried to find using Bureau of Meteorology, Australia website.But can't find any suitable data. Can anyone give me any link to find it out? 

  Thanks in advanced.

I am sure it is a DOE-2 derivative, proabably eQUEST.
I dodn't know TRACE had the VRS module invented yet,
but according to a contributer, it does.

C'mon, you eQUEST folks !!!

You can use the eQUEST weather processor (eQ_WthProc)
   http://doe2.com/index_Wth.html
to read a EPW file and convert to DOE-2 compatible file (that
you can discard if not useful) but then you will have csv files
(orig and final - with doe-2 conversions) with the variables you
want (including headers) on the "final" csv if you uncheck the
"clear Interim Results on Exit" checkbox on the setup tab.

Here is an example original csv partial

My mistake!  You are correct that the epw-->csv conversion will only give DB,
RH, and Dew Point.  The alternate route is to run an annual simulation with
EnergyPlus using the weather file of interest, select "Outdoor Wet Bulb" as an
hourly REPORT VARIABLE, and then use the csv output file to generate
statistics.  One could even generate the averages with EnergyPlus by applying
schedules to the report variable and reporting the scheduled value as monthly
averages.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Radiant floor cooling and increased capacity with
thicker slab

I'm looking into improving the overall efficiency of a radiant cooling
system by increasing the slab thickness 1-2 inches below the tubing and
using night cooling to charge the slab.  Currently, we have 5/8" tubing
fastened to a layer of insulation on grade and 4" of concrete poured on
top.  Ideally, if we can significantly reduce the need for cooling in
the morning for a few hours and even reduce the peak cooling load at 5pm
during the day, then we will definitely look further into this strategy.
Has anyone modeled this or better yet have experience with this on a
project and seen the benefits?

Thanks

Ian,

You may consider to use ESP-r computer program to model such a system,
using a two-dimensional heat transfer model that I implemented in ESP-r
some years ago.  Here is a link to the paper:

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Radiant floor cooling and increased capacity with
thicker slab

I'm looking into improving the overall efficiency of a radiant cooling
system by increasing the slab thickness 1-2 inches below the tubing and
using night cooling to charge the slab.  Currently, we have 5/8" tubing
fastened to a layer of insulation on grade and 4" of concrete poured on
top.  Ideally, if we can significantly reduce the need for cooling in
the morning for a few hours and even reduce the peak cooling load at 5pm
during the day, then we will definitely look further into this strategy.
Has anyone modeled this or better yet have experience with this on a
project and seen the benefits?

Thanks

My mistake!  You are correct that the epw-->csv conversion will only give DB, 
RH, and Dew Point.  The alternate route is to run an annual simulation with 
EnergyPlus using the weather file of interest, select "Outdoor Wet Bulb" as an 
hourly REPORT VARIABLE, and then use the csv output file to generate 
statistics.  One could even generate the averages with EnergyPlus by applying 
schedules to the report variable and reporting the scheduled value as monthly 
averages.

Ashfaque,
I know from when I was working in Australia that the Bureau of Meteorology actually publishes a CD (for a price - I don't think that it costs too much) of weather data for lots of locations around Australia. (including Brisbane) and we used the psychometric functions within the report generator portion of TAS to calculate the hourly wet-bulb temperatures.
I can send you the contact details of the retailer of TAS in Australia if you like.

Regards

David

Energyplus weather files do not have wet-bulb temperatures, do they? I had the impression they only have DB , RH and Dew Point. You might have to manually convert to wetbulb which might be quite an exercise.
Is there a simpler way of computing the data below?

  Envi-met is a good choice to simulate the urban microclimate. Its website is 
  http://www.geographie.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/agklima/envimet/
  "ENVI-met is a three-dimensional microclimate model designed to simulate the surface-plant-air interactions in urban environment with a typical resolution of 0.5 to 10 m in space and 10 sec in time. Typical areas of application are Urban Climatology, Architecture, Building Design or Environmental Planing, just to name a few. "
   
  Another alternative choice is AUSSSM Tool. Its website is 
  http://ktlabo.cm.kyushu-u.ac.jp/e/UHI/ausssm_tool/ausssm_top_e.htm
  "AUSSSM Tool was developed as a computer software, originating from the methodology of the revised-Architectural-Urban-Soil-Simultaneous Simulation Model (revised-AUSSSM), for estimating the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effects in concrete terms."  This software is very east to use,but this software has some limitation. 
   
  The above two softwares are free.   
   
  Hope this helps,

Sam:

I don't really believe you can yet.

Both EnergyPro and VisualDOE (both under AEC tutilage)
are developing the algorithems for this technology, so
I have been been told.

We can only hope eQUEST will do the same. I would
suggest emailing the eQUEST team to encourage this
modification.

Another point on the cooling energy for the proposed model:

Using a 48 deg SADB eliminates a lot of economizer hours, especially in
Seattle.  Raising the SADB will reduce cooling energy but increase fan
energy.  It's a balancing act to find the sweet-spot between cooling
energy and fan energy.

That's what I was thinking initially, but it shouldn't be increasing the
cooling energy by 30% if the cooling control is set to warmest.  If you
set the cooling control to warmest and allow the supply air temp to be
reset with OA (up to 62 F, for example), then you can avoid most
instances where you would be cooling to 48F and then reheating at the
zones.

Another fundamental point is that a VAV reheat system will almost always

use more cooling energy than a single-zone system without reheat, 
assuming they have the same EER and same space loads. In the VAV case, 
there will be some zones that spend time at minimum primary air flow and

reheat kicks in. That is wasted cooling energy that doesn't happen in a 
single-zone system. You can reduce the VAV/reheat cooling penalty by 
reducing the primary air minimum flow settings to each zone, but the 
reduction is limited at some point by ventilation requirements. 

So a VAV saves fan energy in the Appendix G context, but not necessarily

cooling or heating energy.

Natasha,

A couple of things to point out. 

1. Your proposed system is a gas/electric hybrid system, so your
baseline system should be System 3, packaged single zone with dx cooling
and gas furnace heating, not system 4 with heat pump heating. (see TABLE
G3.1.1A)

2. When the baseline building requires a single zone system, each
thermal zone should have its own system assigned to it. This is implied,
though not clearly stated in the published version of Appendix G. It is
discussed in the 90.1 Users Manual. This has also been clarified in
Addendum U to 90.1 2004, which addresses system assignments in Appendix
G in more detail. 

3. I would guess that at least part of your building requires
economizers in the baseline system according to TABLE G3.1.2.6A. 

I am not sure this solves your problem, but I think you may want to
address these issues and then see if the mystery remains.

I am modeling a 3-story office building, 40,000 sf (27,000 sf
conditioned) in Seattle, WA, consisting of parking garage, retail, and
core spaces on the first floor; and core plus open office spaces on the
second and third floors.  I am trying to calculate the estimated energy
cost savings for LEED NC 2.2, which requires the use of a baseline
energy model per ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G guidelines.
 
The proposed design uses a packaged VAV system to serve the core and
office spaces, consisting of: 1) a rooftop packaged AC unit with DX
cooling, high efficiency gas furnace, premium efficiency VSD fan motor,
and economizer; and 2) series fan powered boxes with electric reheat at
each zone.  Cooling supply air is delivered at 48F, and the DX coils
have an EER of 11.7 (fan power removed).  The building envelope includes
35% window to wall ratio, average window assembly U-value of 0.385, and
external wall assembly R-value of R-11.  The controls strategy for the
VAV system cooling is "reset for warmest zone."
 
Per Appendix G, the baseline model uses a constant volume, packaged
rooftop unit with DX cooling and electric heat pump.  To reduce the
number of hours certain spaces were under-heated, I had to include some
heat pump supplemental electric heat and zone reheat.  Cooling supply
air is delivered at 55F, and the DX coils have an EER of 11.6 (fan power
removed).  The building envelope includes 35% window to wall ratio (same
as proposed design), average window assembly U-value of 0.595 (higher
than proposed design), external wall assembly R-value of R-8 (lower than
proposed design), and lighting power densities higher than in the
proposed design.
 
Here is my question:  According to the results, the cooling energy
required for the proposed design model is about 30% greater than the
baseline model.  This does not make sense to me, since the proposed
design model incorporates a VAV system with economizer, slightly
improved EER, and improved building envelope.  (Fan power is 72% lower
and heating is 9% lower than the baseline model, which seems
reasonable.)  Any thoughts on where there might be an error in my
modeling?  I would appreciate any insights or suggestions.
 
Thanks,

If you are looking for long-term averages, you can download the EnergyPlus IWEC 
file for Brisbane (www.energyplus.gov --> Weather Data) and use the EnergyPlus 
weather converter to convert it from epw format to a csv file which includes 
column headings and can be opened in a spreadsheet program.  Then you can 
compute the averages from there.

Hello:
  I was trying to model  demand ventillation strategy for an office building  using MIN-AIR-SCH and Occupancy schedule commands in DOE-2.1e.
  The annual heating was drastically reduced. However, the annual cooling increased by 4%. I am not sure why this happened. Can anybody point out the potential errors I may have made in my assumptions?

Another fundamental point is that a VAV reheat system will almost always 
use more cooling energy than a single-zone system without reheat, 
assuming they have the same EER and same space loads. In the VAV case, 
there will be some zones that spend time at minimum primary air flow and 
reheat kicks in. That is wasted cooling energy that doesn't happen in a 
single-zone system. You can reduce the VAV/reheat cooling penalty by 
reducing the primary air minimum flow settings to each zone, but the 
reduction is limited at some point by ventilation requirements. 

So a VAV saves fan energy in the Appendix G context, but not necessarily 
cooling or heating energy.

Natasha,

A couple of things to point out. 

1. Your proposed system is a gas/electric hybrid system, so your
baseline system should be System 3, packaged single zone with dx cooling
and gas furnace heating, not system 4 with heat pump heating. (see TABLE
G3.1.1A)

2. When the baseline building requires a single zone system, each
thermal zone should have its own system assigned to it. This is implied,
though not clearly stated in the published version of Appendix G. It is
discussed in the 90.1 Users Manual. This has also been clarified in
Addendum U to 90.1 2004, which addresses system assignments in Appendix
G in more detail. 

3. I would guess that at least part of your building requires
economizers in the baseline system according to TABLE G3.1.2.6A. 

I am not sure this solves your problem, but I think you may want to
address these issues and then see if the mystery remains.

I am modeling a 3-story office building, 40,000 sf (27,000 sf
conditioned) in Seattle, WA, consisting of parking garage, retail, and
core spaces on the first floor; and core plus open office spaces on the
second and third floors.  I am trying to calculate the estimated energy
cost savings for LEED NC 2.2, which requires the use of a baseline
energy model per ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G guidelines.
 
The proposed design uses a packaged VAV system to serve the core and
office spaces, consisting of: 1) a rooftop packaged AC unit with DX
cooling, high efficiency gas furnace, premium efficiency VSD fan motor,
and economizer; and 2) series fan powered boxes with electric reheat at
each zone.  Cooling supply air is delivered at 48F, and the DX coils
have an EER of 11.7 (fan power removed).  The building envelope includes
35% window to wall ratio, average window assembly U-value of 0.385, and
external wall assembly R-value of R-11.  The controls strategy for the
VAV system cooling is "reset for warmest zone."
 
Per Appendix G, the baseline model uses a constant volume, packaged
rooftop unit with DX cooling and electric heat pump.  To reduce the
number of hours certain spaces were under-heated, I had to include some
heat pump supplemental electric heat and zone reheat.  Cooling supply
air is delivered at 55F, and the DX coils have an EER of 11.6 (fan power
removed).  The building envelope includes 35% window to wall ratio (same
as proposed design), average window assembly U-value of 0.595 (higher
than proposed design), external wall assembly R-value of R-8 (lower than
proposed design), and lighting power densities higher than in the
proposed design.
 
Here is my question:  According to the results, the cooling energy
required for the proposed design model is about 30% greater than the
baseline model.  This does not make sense to me, since the proposed
design model incorporates a VAV system with economizer, slightly
improved EER, and improved building envelope.  (Fan power is 72% lower
and heating is 9% lower than the baseline model, which seems
reasonable.)  Any thoughts on where there might be an error in my
modeling?  I would appreciate any insights or suggestions.
 
Thanks,

You might try the new Trace 700 - it has an option for VRV systems. I
haven't used it, but perhaps others can comment on its accuracy, ease of
use, etc.

Hi,

SUNtool is an EC-funded project that:

" ... aims to develop an environmental modelling tool and supporting knowledge base that enables planners of communities (architects, town planners, developers, etc) to rapidly define an optimal sustainable solution in terms of building design, site layout, the mix of uses and combination of energy saving and renewable technologies."

Hello Professor Koerniawan:

 

There?s a researcher at the Desert Architecture and Urban Planning Unit at
the Jacob Blaustein Institute for Desert Research in Israel, who has
published extensively in the subject area related to your question.  His
name is Dr. Evyatar Erell, and he recently completed a PhD dissertation on
an Urban Canyon Model for predicting urban street temperatures when the only
available climate data are from nearby airport measuring sites.  He recently
presented his model to an ASHRAE Seminar in Quebec City in June of this
year.

 

I?m not sure that he would have any software available, but he certainly
would be regarded as an expert in the subject area and may be able to point
you in a fruitful direction.  You can contact him at:
erell at bgumail.bgu.ac.il

 

Best regards,

 

LOD

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200608240438.AA3807140pd80001212706@gard.com>

Dear IBPSA Members and Friends

THE DEADLINE IS LOOMING ? 31ST AUGUST 2006

WE HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED A FEW ENTRIES IN EACH CATEGORY BUT WOULD LIKE THIS
TO BE A REAL CONTEST!  FROM THE NUMBER OF EMAILS FLYING AROUND BLDG-SIM,
THERE MUST BE MORE WORTHY YOUNG CONTRIBUTORS, DISTINGUISED SIMULATORS AND
EMMINENT PRACTICES OUT THERE ? SO PLEASE CONSIDER NOMINATING A WORTHY
INDIVIDUAL OR PRACTICE IN ANY OF THE THREE CATEGORIES LISTED BELOW:

In order to allow the awardees time to plan to attend, it is time to
consider nominations for the up-coming 2007 conference in Beijing, China.
We would now invite nominations in the usual three categories as listed
below and for each category we will require a brief CV or summary of work
(relating to the appropriate category) for the nominee(s) plus the
additional information outlined for each category below (Distinguished
Service Award, Young Contributor Award, and Outstanding Practice).

Nominations should be sent in the first instance to Lori McElroy as
representative of the Awards Committee ? lori.mcelroy at thelighthouse.co.uk by
a closing date of the 31st August 2006.

We hope that there will be a good competition this time, so please contact
me to discuss a possible nomination if required.  We also hope that
nominations will be made for the Distinguished Practice Award this time
around, as no award was made in this category last time, despite the fact
that there is plenty of appropriate talent Worldwide.

Kind regards

Lori McElroy

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200608240257.AA5754546pd80001212577@gard.com>

Hello All,

I require average hourly statistics (Jan-Dec) for wet bulb temperatures (?C
or ?F) of Brisbane, Australia. I tried to find using Bureau of Meteorology,
Australia website.But can't find any suitable data. Can anyone give me any
link to find it out?

Thanks in advanced.

This is more or less correct, but the full 
explanation requires the introduction of some 
additional jargon.  The throttling range is a 
parameter of proportional control, the set point 
being the other.  For a system controlled 
proportionally, there is only one value of the 
cooling load for which the set point temperature 
is exactly satisfied.  If the load is less, space 
temperature will drop below set point and if it 
is greater, it will rise above.  The difference 
between this operating point and the set point is 
called error or offset.  Offset can be reduced or 
eliminated by adding a second, integral, 
component to the controller.  In integral 
control, the time integral of error is used to 
drive the space temperature back toward set point 
regardless of load.  Proportional + integral (PI) 
control is a type of control action that does not 
inherently require the use of digital controls, 
but has become commonplace because of them.

A good explanation with illustrative diagrams can 
be found at the Iowa Energy Center's DDC Online web site:

To quote Shakespeare (and the DOE-2.1E mnual)

"Throttling Range specifies the number of degrees that
room temperature must change to go from full heating
to zero heating and/or full cooling to zero cooling."

The zone thermostat setpoint is assumed to be at the
middle of the throttling range. (DOE-2.2 manual add)

In other words, if you set your cooling t'stat at 72?F
and set a throttling range of 3 degrees, you would be
at full cooling at 73.5?F space temp and full cooling
off at 70.5?F (as it is explained).

I believe this has to do with the "slop" in the T'stat
(which DDC controls virtually eliminates).

But it also comes into play when you swing from
cooling to heating and vice versa (such as a VAV
system).

Holly,
 
There's a beautiful diagram on throttling range, buried in the eQUEST Help files, that will explain all and make things right with the world. Here's how to get it.
 

1.	Open your eQUEST Help.
2.	Under the FIND tab, type in Air-Side HVAC System Control Strategies.
3.	Select the Air-Side HVAC System Control Strategies Topic Contents and click DISPLAY. The Air-Side HVAC System Control Strategies Topic Contents opens.
4.	From the topic list, click the General Air-Side HVAC System Control Strategies hyperlink. The General Air-Side HVAC System Control Strategies topic opens.
5.	Scroll down about 7 or 8 paragraphs to the Zone Thermostats and Throttling Ranges heading.
6.	On the next line, click the FIGURE hyperlink,and voila, the diagram appears. 

This diagram shows the relationship among throttling ranges, set point temperatures, and dead band. Personally, I didn't get the concept of throttling range until I digested this diagram.
 
Essentially, throttling range is the temperate range over which a heating system is heating a space or cooling system is cooling a space. For example, if your setpoint for heating is 72F and your throttling range is 4F, then the system will start heating when the temperature drops to 70F and continue heating until the space temperature reaches 74F (a 4 degree range). 
 
How the system heats or cools depends on the system type (but that is another topic).

Yes, all DCV stuff is functioning (download Version
3.6). I just used this on an office building project
in Pasadena, CA. Still a bit of black magic to me,
until I start printing some hourly printouts for the
data.

Jaya,
 
I don't know if these are fully functional yet, but the help in the latest
version of Equest has the following:
 
DCV-RETURN-SENSOR This codeword instructs the program to model a DCV device
that uses a CO2 differential between the SYSTEM return air stream and OA
intake air stream to determine the hourly minimum OA fraction. The program
calculates the OA minimum requirement and sets the minimum damper position
hourly based upon the sum of the ZONE requirements. Each zone OA requirement
is calculated based upon the hourly maximum of either OA-CFM/PER (times the
NUMBER-OF-PEOPLE adjusted by the hourly PEOPLE-SCHEDULE) or a minimum OA
ventilation rate. The zone minimum OA ventilation rate is either
MIN-OUTSIDE-AIR if specified or the maximum of OA-CHANGES (times the zone
VOLUME/60), OA-FLOW/AREA (times the zone AREA.)

DCV-ZONE-SENSORS   This codeword instructs the program to model a DCV device
that uses the highest CO2 differential between the each ZONE air and OA
intake air stream to determine the hourly minimum OA fraction. The program
calculates the OA minimum requirement and sets the minimum damper position
hourly using the ?critical? zone requirement; the critical zone requirement
is defined as the zone having the highest fraction of OA relative to its
hourly supply air flow rate. Each zone OA requirement is calculated based
upon the hourly maximum of either OA-CFM/PER (times the NUMBER-OF-PEOPLE
adjusted by the hourly PEOPLE-SCHEDULE) or a minimum OA ventilation rate.
The zone minimum OA ventilation rate is either MIN-OUTSIDE-AIR if specified
or the maximum of OA-CHANGES (times the zone VOLUME/60), OA-FLOW/AREA (times
the zone AREA.). The value of the zone minimum OA ventilation flow rate is
divided by the specified/calculated zone supply flow to calculate hourly
zone OA fraction; the zone with the highest hourly flow fraction value is
the ?critical? zone.  Setting the sum of the ZONE OA flow requirements
divided by the system total supply fan flow to X, and letting the critical
zone OA fraction be denoted as Z, the system hourly minimum OA flow fraction

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] modeling thermal energy storage in Equest
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200608212329.AA2918968pd80001209717@gard.com>

Greetings - this email is from Linda Morrison with Ambient Energy.

The physical components of an ice storage plant are a 200 ton screw chiller
used for both making chilled water during the day and ice at night, a
condenser water loop and cooling tower, a chilled water loop, and a thermal
storage component.  The ice storage will be charged at night and the day
cooling load will be met by discharging the ice storage and running the
chiller.

My question is how to best model in eQuest the different operating points of
the chiller because there is a much higher kW/ton during ice production (22
F) than during chilled water production (45 F).  Should I: 

1) have a single chiller represented in Equest and use the part load curve
to get the different kW/ton or 

2) have two chillers represented in eQuest, one which does chilled water and
one which makes ice.  

If option 1 then would averaging the part load curves make sense? If it is
option 2, what is the best way to schedule the chillers (ice and chilled
water are mutually exclusive)?

Thank you very much.

eQUEST version 3.6 and DOE-2.2 version 44 Released



These new versions of eQUEST and DOE-2.2 were posted to http://DOE2.com on August 12, 2006.  eQUEST 
3.6 contains a complete version of DOE-2.2 version 44d3 as its simulation engine. This version of 
eQUEST was also submitted, along with D2Comply version 3.6, to the California Energy Commission for 
certification as an Alternative Calculation Method for the non-residential 2005 Title 24 Standards. 
Additionally, eQUEST 3.6 has been updated to perform analysis of energy savings and calculate 
incentive payments for the California State-wide Saving By Design new construction energy efficiency 
program.



To download eQUEST freeware go to http://DOE2.com/eQUEST

To download DOE-2.2 freeware got to http://DOE2.com/DOE2 (not needed if you install the above eQUEST 
version)



Below is a partial list of new features you will find in eQUEST 3.6 and DOE-2.2-44d3.





New simulation features in DOE-2.2 version 44

(Excerpts from Volume 6 of DOE-2.2 Manuals - all have new eQUEST interface controls as well)



Water-Loop and Ground Source Heat Pump Enhancements
The ability to model water loop heat pumps , in both ground coupled and conventional configurations, 
has been greatly enhanced in two major ways:

1.      Water-source heat pump - the PVVT, PVAVS and PSZ systems can now be specified to be 
water-loop heat pump systems thus allowing all the options of these SYSTEM TYPEs to be available for 
use in modeling water -loop heat pump configurations (including variable flow, staged heating and 
cooling, heat recovery, ERV's, as well as sub-zone conditioning and return air plenum pathways.

2.      Vertical well ground source heat exchangers - a new modeling approach has been added to more 
accurately model vertical wells. This new model allows the specification of grout properties, the 
fluid type plus a library of 42 well configurations is included..

These enhancements to the water-source and ground-source heat pump modeling capability of DOE-2.2 
were supported, in part, by ClimateMaster, Inc. The new vertical well ground heat exchanger model is 
based upon work by Claesson, Eskilson, Hellstrom, .et.al, at the University of Lund, Sweden and 
Spitler, et.al., at Oklahoma State University; changes for the new heat exchanger models were 
implemented in collaboration with ClimateMaster.

Small "Frictionless" Centrifugal Chillers
Centrifugal chillers most commonly have been available in sizes 300 tons (1000 kW) and larger. 
Recent developments in compressor technology now allow hermetic centrifugal chillers to be available 
in sizes as small as 70 tons (250 kW).  These compressors utilize frictionless bearings and do not 
circulate oil with the refrigerant.  Capacity modulation is via a variable-speed drive and inlet 
vanes.  Multiple compressors can share a common evaporator and condenser (not circuited separately), 
further improving part load performance.

The implementation into DOE-2.2 is for chillers with water-cooled condensers.  As with any 
variable-speed centrifugal, part-load performance is maximized by allowing the cooling tower 
temperature to float, or by utilizing a wetbulb-reset strategy.  Models for the use of small 
frictionless compressors in air-cooled chillers and built-up DX equipment are planned for later 
during 2006 and early 2007.



Glass Manufacturer Window Library
A new set of window entries have been added to the window library.  These entries reflect actual 
products sold on the market today.  Depending on whether the glazing system is single glazed, double 
glazed or triple glazed, the user can select a window with a glazing system from a specific glass 
manufacturer.  The user needs to be familiar with the glass types offered by a manufacturer in order 
to select the corresponding window system from the library.

The new windows were created within WINDOW 5.2 using glass from release 14.4 of the International 
Glazing Database (IGDB 14.4).  The International Glazing Database includes spectral data for glass 
manufactured by all glass manufacturers who have chosen to submit their data for peer review to 
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.   Use of these windows improves the accuracy of the 
calculations because the windows represent actual products and the simulations employ the angular 
properties of the glazing systems from WINDOW 5.2.

Return Duct Losses
The program has simulated supply duct thermal heat gains/losses and leakage for several years.  This 
capability has been extended to return ducts. The keyword RETURN-UA is specified to define the UA 
value of the return duct.  This value should include losses through the duct insulation as well as 
any bypass effects due to the duct hangars, crushed insulation, etc.  This keyword applies only for 
air handlers having return ducts; if the return is via plenums, then this keyword is ignored.

Boiler and Chiller Cycling Losses

When a boiler or chiller is online, but there is no load on the equipment, the equipment may still 
use energy simply to remain at the required supply temperature.  Previously, this effect was 
approximated using a portion of the START-UP-TIME.  Now, a keyword, STANDBY-TIME, is used to 
explicitly account for this standby energy.  Additionally, the default ELEC-INPUT-RATIO for forced 
draft boilers (i.e., ) has been lowered from 0.022 to 0.0024.



New 'Triggers' Methods for the Deployment of Window Shades

Window management options in DOE-2 have long permitted users to specify a schedule of solar 
radiation, i.e., MAX-SOLAR-SCH, to help 'trigger' the deployment of window shades.  DOE-2 version 
2.1E used transmitted direct (beam) solar radiation. Previous versions of DOE-2.2 used exterior 
incident total (beam + diffuse) solar radiation as the trigger.  The new MAX-SOLAR-CTRL keyword 
allows selection among four alternative trigger quantities: Incident Direct, Incident Total, 
Transmitted Direct and Transmitted Total.



New analysis features in eQUEST 3.6



2005 Title 24 Non-Residential Compliance Analysis

The Alternative Calculation Method (ACM) for the non-residential Title 24 Standards capability has 
been updated for use in showing compliance with the 2005 version of the Standard.  This includes 
changes to the Title 24 "ruleset" as well as changes to the wizard input and BDL generations and 
many changes to the detail edit mode screens.



2006 Savings By Design Analysis

The Savings By Design (SBD) analysis capability has been updated to agree with the 2006 California 
statewide program as offered by electric and gas utilities.  This capability includes the ability to 
calculate incentive payments for program participation.



New Detail Edit Mode On-line Help

The eQUEST on-line help systems for the detail edit mode has been completely replaced with a system 
that fully incorporates the entire set of current DOE-2.2 manuals reformatted as a single searchable 
help system.  In the detail edit mode, using the quick menu (accessed using a right mouse click on a 
interface data entry control) will present item and topic help selections which take you directly to 
the relevant item of the help system; this will normally include any DOE-2.2 manual pages for the 
BDL element that corresponds to the interface control selected.

Wizard HVAC selection of Ground Source Heat Pump

The building creation wizards now include the capability to select and define the details of a 
ground loop heat pump circulation loop and ground heat exchanger system.



New Hourly Results Export Option

A new more convenient capability has been added for use with hourly reports that allows the easy 
export of the contents of any hourly report to a CSV file, ready for use with spreadsheet programs. 
To access this new feature, from within the eQUEST detailed edit mode, select 'File', then 'Export 
Hourly Results'.



Wizard HVAC "System per area" Selection

The Design Development Wizard has a new input control on the System screen that allows control of 
the number of air handlers for each system type to be used when the DOE-2.2 input file is created, 
i.e., one per zone, one per floor, one per shell, one per project.

Steve / Jeff,
Correct me if I am wrong but eQuest does have a part load curve that varies
efficiency (HIR) as a function of either entering (or leaving) water
temperature.  This curve however defaults to 1 regardless of temperature.
If one has the data then I believe you can set up the curve and thus the
unit to perform the way you want.
Regards,
Graham

Chris,
A comment on "picking an average" return water temp:

In New England, return water temperatures will vary significantly during the
heating season, and picking an average will not accurately show monthly fuel
consumption.  What we have done in this situation is to set up two boilers
in the model, one with condensing performance, and the other with standard
performance.  We then use equipment scheduling to switch between the two
based on OA temp.  The OA temp threshold is based on the HW Reset Schedule,
the expected coil delta T, and the return water temperature at which the
boiler goes into condensing mode.  I believe the return water value is
around 135F.

It would be a nice feature to have eQuest allow return water temp to factor
into boiler performance.

Aerco efficiency curves are available for their condensing boilers on the 
aerco web site.  You can then create the DOE2 curves following the DOE2 
manual.  Note that condensing boiler efficiency depends on the return water 
temperature.  As far as I know, the boiler efficiency curve in DOE2 does 
not include return water temperature so you have to pick an "average" 
return water temperature for your specific application and then use that
curve.

Steve,

We?ve recently worked on a project with VFD-controlled 450-ton centrifugal
chillers that can handle ECWT of 55?F or less.  When we have simulated
chillers in eQuest, we generally make our own curves that cover the range of
expected operations.  I would support the idea of a warning instead of an
error.  Perhaps the warning should suggest that the appropriate curve fits
be confirmed?

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Condenser Water Reset in eQuest

 

We are checking eQUEST to confirm the issue of MIN-COND-T, and will fix it
if it is missing.

 

Mike is correct that the capacity and power performance curves were not fit
for condenser temperatures below 65-70F, and the default MIN-COND-T reflects
this fact.  The reason is because the majority of chillers cannot operate
satisfactorily much below this temperature.   For many reciprocating
chilllers, the expansion valve requires a minimum pressure differential in
order to operate and deliver the rated capacity.  Centrifugal chillers may
also be limited.  Recently, we were investigating a ?frictionless?
centrifugal compressor, and learned that motor cooling would be inadequate
if the condenser temperature (and pressure) drops much below about this
value; insufficient liquid refrigerant would be injected into the motor.

 

If you want to investigate lower condenser temperatures, we recommend that
you inspect the capacity and eir curves in the regime of interest to confirm
whether they yield reasonable results.

 

The best way to use the DIAGNOSTIC NO-LIMITS override is to first debug your
input at a higher diagnostic level so that the BDL can issue errors,
warnings, cautions.  Once you are ready to run, then set NO-LIMITS.

 

Depending on feedback we get from people, we can reduce the lower limit of
MIN-COND-T, or change the error checking so that it issues a warning rather
than an error.  As the curves are NOT fit for temperatures lower than about
65F, the lower limit should probably remain the same, but the checking
reduced from an error to a warning.  Comments?

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Condenser Water Reset in eQuest

 

 

Hi all..I thought I would share a couple of tips on using Condenser Water
Reset Strategies in eQuest . Hopefully some of you will find this useful.

We just finished modeling a chiller plant where we looked at using low
condenser water temperatures ( below 60F ) as an energy efficiency measure.
The project is in a climate with very low wetbulb temperatures .  There are
a couple of quirks I thought I would share about trying to model a strategy
like this.  

The Condenser Loop Control tab has several options for resetting the loop
temperature.  If you notice MIN-RESET-T always defaults to 70F. 

Issue  #1:  If you reset the Condenser loop MIN-RESET-T lower than 70F (say
65F) and then run an hourly report to check the loop temperature everything
looks like it's working fine.  BUT..if you also check the chiller entering
condenser temperature you will find it never goes below 70F even though the
condenser loop says it should be lower.  This is because the chiller has a
keyword MIN-COND-T that defualts to 70F and cannot be changed from within
eQuest.  You have to change the keyword manually in the input file by adding
the line, MIN-COND-T = 65 underneath the definition of your chiller.

  
The most likely reason this defaults to 70F is because the default chiller
performance curves were not designed for condenser temperatures below 70F  (
someone should correct me if this is wrong)  

If you want to try and model condenser water temperatures below 70F I highly
recommend you create custom performance curves that include data points that
describe the operation of your chiller at the appropriate condenser water
conditions.

That brings me to Issue #2. 

The MIN-COND-T keyword has a lower limit of 60F.  In other words even if you
create the appropriate performance curves  and then try to set MIN-COND-T
lower than 60F you will get a simulation error.  

You can work around this by using the DIAGNOSTIC keyword "NO-LIMITS".  In
effect this turns off both the Max and Min keyword limits.  You can then
simulate chiller operation with very low condesner water temperatures.  

If you use the "NO-LIMITS" keyword do so very carefully.  This is a very
important error checking function of DOE2.2 eQuest.

Does anybody know where can I find a list of 120 response factors for 
ASHRAE walls?

Thank you in advance.

Kendra,
 
I am not sure how you've got your systems setup but you shouldn't need
to use the Min OA Schedule to force the OA to 100% in the summer.  I
have found that the best way to simulate Dir/Ind systems is to use the
keyowrds on the Pre-Conditioner tab under your HVAC system as opposed to
using the DIR/IND System Type (check the DOE 2.2 documentation for the
differences).  One of the keywords is EVAP-CLR-AIR which describes the %
of supply air that will pass through the DIR/IND.  Set this to 1.0, then
set the keyword DRYBULB-LIMIT to some high value like 130 (default is
120).  Anytime the outside air temp is below DRYBULB-LIMIT and above
your SAT the DIR/IND will use 100% OA.
 
The nice thing about using the DIR/IND on the pre-conditioner tab versus
the DIR/IND system type is you can set up all the keyword variables and
then turn it on and off using a parametric run.

	I am trying to simulate the following system:

	A DX cooler with VAV (HW reheat) that uses 100% outside air and
an indirect/direct evap cooler in the cooling months (the climate is Las
Vegas - very hot and dry).  In the winter, the outside air should be at
a minimum as determine by the OA/person specified at the zonal level.

	I created a Minimum OA Schedule and set the fraction to 1.0 for
the cooling months.  In the help menu, and in the DOE2.2 documentation,
it says to set the schedule value to -999 when you want the fraction to
revert to the minimum calculated OA.  When I tried to enter -999, I get
an error saying that negative values are not accepted.  I tried changing
this in the input file, but when I open the file in eQuest, I receive
errors as well.

	Does anyone know how to get eQuest to accept the -999 value in
the minimum OA schedule?

	Thank you!

Kendra:

Are you opening eQUEST in the Detailed Interface Mode?

I know DOE-2 has always been "-999" friendly, and
indeed have seen DOE-2.2 input files with -999 used.

I haven't try this myself, but it may be the "kicker."

Condenser Water Reset in eQuestMike,

What great timing you have. I was grappling with this exact issue this
morning. You saved me some time.

There seems to be a work around for the issue of the min CW temp at the
chiller. You say that "the chiller has a keyword MIN-COND-T that defualts to
70F and cannot be changed from within eQuest". I could not find how to
change it within the main body of eQUEST either. However, it seems you CAN
change it in a parametric run. I did this and it seems to be reflected in
the chiller condenser water temp in my hourly report.

  Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Condenser Water Reset in eQuest




  Hi all..I thought I would share a couple of tips on using Condenser Water
Reset Strategies in eQuest . Hopefully some of you will find this useful.

  We just finished modeling a chiller plant where we looked at using low
condenser water temperatures ( below 60F ) as an energy efficiency measure.
The project is in a climate with very low wetbulb temperatures .  There are
a couple of quirks I thought I would share about trying to model a strategy
like this.

  The Condenser Loop Control tab has several options for resetting the loop
temperature.  If you notice MIN-RESET-T always defaults to 70F.

  Issue  #1:  If you reset the Condenser loop MIN-RESET-T lower than 70F
(say 65F) and then run an hourly report to check the loop temperature
everything looks like it's working fine.  BUT..if you also check the chiller
entering condenser temperature you will find it never goes below 70F even
though the condenser loop says it should be lower.  This is because the
chiller has a keyword MIN-COND-T that defualts to 70F and cannot be changed
from within eQuest.  You have to change the keyword manually in the input
file by adding the line, MIN-COND-T = 65 underneath the definition of your
chiller.


  The most likely reason this defaults to 70F is because the default chiller
performance curves were not designed for condenser temperatures below 70F
( someone should correct me if this is wrong)

  If you want to try and model condenser water temperatures below 70F I
highly recommend you create custom performance curves that include data
points that describe the operation of your chiller at the appropriate
condenser water conditions.

  That brings me to Issue #2.

  The MIN-COND-T keyword has a lower limit of 60F.  In other words even if
you create the appropriate performance curves  and then try to set
MIN-COND-T lower than 60F you will get a simulation error.

  You can work around this by using the DIAGNOSTIC keyword "NO-LIMITS".  In
effect this turns off both the Max and Min keyword limits.  You can then
simulate chiller operation with very low condesner water temperatures.

  If you use the "NO-LIMITS" keyword do so very carefully.  This is a very
important error checking function of DOE2.2 eQuest.

We are checking eQUEST to confirm the issue of MIN-COND-T, and will fix it
if it is missing.

 

Mike is correct that the capacity and power performance curves were not fit
for condenser temperatures below 65-70F, and the default MIN-COND-T reflects
this fact.  The reason is because the majority of chillers cannot operate
satisfactorily much below this temperature.   For many reciprocating
chilllers, the expansion valve requires a minimum pressure differential in
order to operate and deliver the rated capacity.  Centrifugal chillers may
also be limited.  Recently, we were investigating a 'frictionless'
centrifugal compressor, and learned that motor cooling would be inadequate
if the condenser temperature (and pressure) drops much below about this
value; insufficient liquid refrigerant would be injected into the motor.

 

If you want to investigate lower condenser temperatures, we recommend that
you inspect the capacity and eir curves in the regime of interest to confirm
whether they yield reasonable results.

 

The best way to use the DIAGNOSTIC NO-LIMITS override is to first debug your
input at a higher diagnostic level so that the BDL can issue errors,
warnings, cautions.  Once you are ready to run, then set NO-LIMITS.

 

Depending on feedback we get from people, we can reduce the lower limit of
MIN-COND-T, or change the error checking so that it issues a warning rather
than an error.  As the curves are NOT fit for temperatures lower than about
65F, the lower limit should probably remain the same, but the checking
reduced from an error to a warning.  Comments?

Kathryn,
 
In the newly released eQuest v3.60 you can select whether a heat pump
will be standard water source or ground source and the program will
adjust the curves for you.  You will still need to provide all the
necessary details on the ground loop.  Good luck.

Kathryn,
 
One other thing you need to be sure to do if you're trying to model
ground source heat pumps is to download the GSHP performance curves from
the DOE22.com website.  The default curves in eQuest are not suitable
for the low water temperatures typically associated with ground source
systems.
 
The curves need to be copied into the .inp file which you can do with a
text editor.  The inp file is located in the project folder that equest
creates for your model.  The zip file with the curves includes
directions on where in the inp file they need to be copied.

Aerco efficiency curves are available for their condensing boilers on the 
aerco web site.  You can then create the DOE2 curves following the DOE2 
manual.  Note that condensing boiler efficiency depends on the return water 
temperature.  As far as I know, the boiler efficiency curve in DOE2 does 
not include return water temperature so you have to pick an "average" 
return water temperature for your specific application and then use that curve.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200608161735.AA355331pd80001203313@gard.com>

Hi,
I'm trying to change an existing model from a conventional packaged HVAC
system to a ground source heat pump.  Is there any document providing
instructions for setting this up?  I have already changed my boiler and
chiller to a heat pump system, and added a circulation loop. But I don't
know how to add a ground source heat exchanger to my circulation loop
amongst other things.

Kathryn

Natural Resources Canada included a curve for condensing boilers in
their recent EE4 release which is based on the DOE2.1e engine.  The
software is free at ee4.com but I don't know the source for the
condensing boiler curves.  

They are... 

Condensing:
B-HIR-FPLR-COND   CURVE-FIT  TYPE = QUADRATIC
COEF=(0.00533,0.904,0.09066) ..

Non-condensing:
B-HIR-FPLR-NONCOND   CURVE-FIT  TYPE = QUADRATIC
COEF=(0.082597,0.996764,-0.079361) ..

There were a couple of posts out there looking for condensing boiler
curves for DOE2 (Bryce, Doug) - anyone have any luck?

Specifically we're looking at Aerco Benchmark and Gasmaster.

Any help would be appreciated!

Thanks!

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200608151445.AA4516765pd80001201826@gard.com>

Excuse me for the second posting but I just want to make sure I communicate
my query correctly.

I am using functions (READ and WRITE) in a DOE-2.1E model to make it read an
external text file that is in a format recognizable by FORTRAN. I have
successfully done it using READ function for one external file for a single
zone building but when I try to do it with two zones and make the model read
two external files, I get an error message reading:

*ERR* IO-09 system file error - Too many open files

Hence I need to know if making the functions read a second external file is
possible at all in DOE-2.1E and if yes, how it can be done.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200608151340.AA4003718pd80001201678@gard.com>

I am trying to model a DX Unit with an evaporatively cooled condenser in
eQuest, and the only condenser types available for packaged units are
air-cooled, water-cooled, and evap. pre-cooled.  The evap precooled
option is not the same as modeling a packaged evaporative condensing
unit, so I am modeling this system with a chiller that has a remote
evaporatively cooled condenser.  I am setting my pump power to zero on
the chilled water loop, but my question is in reference to the chilled
water and condenser water temperature setpoints.

I don't know what to input for my chilled water and condenser water
temps at design and rated conditions.  In reality, I know my entering
and leaving drybulb and wetbulb air temperatures, but since I'm modeling
this as a chiller, does anyone have any suggestions for what to input
for the water temps?

Thank you!

Try this again.

Mike, if you have your base case model is now the way
you want it, then leave the Wizard Mode (never to
return in THIS mode).

Now create the parametric run AND the life cycle cost
inputs from the Tools Menu within the Detailed
Interface Mode.  You may change as many (I believe)
parameters as you wish for the Parametric run.

Good luck !!

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200608101230.AA302646pd80001196394@gard.com>

Hi,

Using DOE2.1E, I am trying to simulate DHW energy usage that uses
utility plant steam and a steam/hot water converter. Utility plant steam
is also used as the heat source for the building's hydronic heating
systems. We can simulate the steam use for the building's hydronic
systems by specifying a steam utility rate without assigning a boiler.
With this arrangement, we then proceed to add a domestic hot water
heater but steam is not allowed in the program as a fuel source for the
DHW heater. If we were to create a HW boiler and use it to emulate the
DHW heater, we can choose a steam meter for it but the program defaults
to natural gas as energy source regardless of the type of meter
selected. A big problem with this method is that the program will use
the HW boiler to satisfy the building's hydronic loads and not for DHW
use. I'll start thinking along the lines of Load Assignment but am not
very familiar with the programming language associated with it. I do
know that DOE2.1E forbids the use of load assignments for DHW heaters.

If anyone has an idea of how to tackle this or has had similar
experience, please don't hesitate to reply.

Thanks!

-Ivy

Brett,
 
Funny you should ask. Last week at the SIM BUILD 2006
conference in Boston, Joe Huang from LBL presented some 
work he is doing on Title 24 test cases, converting files 
written in DOE-2.1E to EnergyPlus. Joe has an "alpha" 
version of his translator called doe2ep that might be helpful. 
 
You might contact Joe at YJHuang at lbl.gov and see if his 
translator is ready for prime time.

Matt, I believe your question asks how to generate the two different glazings on the building (fastest). In order to assign the two windows to different areas of the building, the fastest way is creating the two glazing and applying them through search and replace techniques in the INP file. After this is done, one can make global changes to one glazing or the other through parametric runs or changing the glazing directly in the inputs, as has been mentioned in past responses.
 
If you use parameters and only have one glazing assigned, all of your windows will change as opposed to only half of your windows.

You can use the parametric simulation function to select a whole bunch of windows and change the glass type. You can also set the global parameters if you are using the simplified glass model to vary either SC, VT or Uvalue parametrically.  (This is in the detailed interface).

Matt,
it seems to me that you could build a logic expression for the window
construction based on a window parameter you're not using, say the glare
control probability or the sun control probability.

Since 0.235 # of water per hour = around 235 Btu/hr, you should be seeing a
little less load than your assumption of 250 Btu/hr latent, but definitely
not 245% more.  By the way, ASHRAE recommended values for people in
restaurants is 275 Btu/hr sensible and 275 Btu/hr latent to account for the
extra heat (30 Btu/hr each for sensible and latent) from the food per
individual.

Subject: [bldg-sim] People load: BTUs vs moisture

Hi,
I'm designing an expensive residential dining room in Shanghai that
will be dehumidified using the required outside air through a
chilled-water coil and the room's sensible loads will be met using
radiant cooling from an exposed, chilled slab.

When I calculate the cooling/dehumidifying load based on moisture
output per person (using 0.235 lb/hr/person), I come up with a
cooling
capacity that is 245% of what I need if I size the system to meet the
heat output per person (250 latent + 250 sensible).

Why do the two approaches yield such different system sizes?  (Or:
why
do the BTU/hr/person numbers not correspond to the
pounds-of-moisture/hr/person numbers?)

Is my moisture load (0.235 lb/hr/person) a good assumption for
sedentary dining in comfortable conditions?

Does ASHRAE Fundamentals list a table of moisture output/person in
different conditions?

Thanks in advance.

Dan,
Not sure if this is relevant, but have you factored in the reheat load
associated with dehumidifying using a cooling coil? That might be where
your getting the additional load. Also - if you are cooling sensibly
separately, you might want to dehumidify using a liquid desiccant
system. This could end up saving you a lot.

Subject: [bldg-sim] Dedicated Outdoor Air in eQUEST
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200608071352.AA5245765pd80001192790@gard.com>

I am modelling dedicated outdoor air systems (DOAS) in eQUEST with each zone having it's own PSZ recirculation system.  I posted this once and got some generous advice involving a dummy zone that I did not have time to implement before a deadline.  Instead, I tried to have the entire building's outside air load in one zone with the other zones having PSZ's that represent what is realistically in the building, hopefully accounting for the recirulation loads accurately as well as the OA loads.  I'm not sure if I did it correctly.  Any help with the following questions would be very appreciated:

1. How do I make sure that the PSZ's have zero outside air?
2. How do I make sure the DOAS has 100% outside air (but can still vary between the minimum outside air requirement and the maximum, depending on the load in those zone)
3. Should I, instead, specify the PSZ's also as 100% OA but have them draw it from the zone I have taking the entire OA load (wouldn't this then require it to exhaust some air to the outdoors and creat more load?  The DOAS zone know that this air was leaving and realize that it was exhausting more air than it was supplying?)

Thanks very much.

Matt,

 

You can change it manually in the detailed data edit mode, but changing
floor to floor heights, wall heights, etc.  If you want to do it in the
wizard, you'd have to create a building shell (and associated footprint)
for each zone height.  OR create another building shell on top of the
first footprint that adds the additional height to the necessary zones.
You would make the top zones "Open to Below" in the zone characteristics
box (on the sheet where you define the footprint).

Hello everyone,

Does anybody know if it is possible to assign different heights in
various Zones within the same footprint.  

Thanks for any help,

I am not used to using the EQuest interface of DOE-2.2, but are you sizing
from the weather file or design day?  If the design day, was this
automatically changed when you changed weather files?

Vikram (and others):

SURE you can change an interior wall to an exterior
wall. You will need to do it in the .INP file with a
Text Editor. The change will show up in the Detailed
IEdit mode. Don't go back to the Wizard mode after
that, or the change will erase.

Any trick you could do in old RAW Doe-2, you can still
do. Just not in the eQUEST interface every time.

Matt,

1. You might have to use the "rectangular atrium" option in the wizard when
you are selecting a shape for your building. Then you can define windows on
the courtyard walls.

2. For a wall to be an exterior wall, you have to create an exterior wall
(Though construction layers of an internal wall can be defined to be similar
to those of an exterior wall, DOE-2 treats interior walls in a different way
thermally as compared to an exterior wall)

Hope this helps,
Ramana.

Mike,
Per the USGBC, LEED NC addresses new buildings and major renovations.
LEED EB is designed to address O&M of existing buildings. If you are
performing a major renovation (which I think you are in this case), you
should use LEED NC. As a rule of thumb a major renovation involves
elements of major HVAC renovation, significant envelope modifications
(adding 2 stories would fall under this I think) and major interior
rehabilitation (Page 24 of the 2.2 reference guide).
 
I would say you fall under NC. You will probably get less credit for
your energy performance, but I think you can take significant credit in
the MR section for retaining the existing building shell. 
 
Hope this helps

Hi all, 

I have aLEED EA-1 question that I am hoping someone has had to deal with
previously. 

I am looking at a potential LEED project that involves the extensive
renovation of an existing building and the construction of a new
addition.  The existing building is three floors (15,000 sq.ft.) and the
new addition will be two stories (4,000 sq.ft.).  

I am wondering how USGBC is currently dealing with projects that
incorporate renovation and addition.  At what point is a project still
considered an existing building allowing the use of the Existing
Building savings percentages?  I cannot seem to find a discussion about
it in the NC 2.1 User's Manual.  

Any advice would be appreciated, thank you.

The simplest way to do the courtyard thing (through the wizard) is to
model a small gap through one of the sides of the courtyard. What you'll
need to do then is to go in and delete the 2 exterior walls facing the
gap.
 
It is not possible to change interior wall types to exterior wall types
(that I know of), but you can create an exterior wall in the same
position, and delete the interior wall.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200608031349.AA4914203pd80001188557@gard.com>

Hi all,

We are starting to model a three story office building with a system
consisting of a single 100 hp double duct supply fan with economizer,
preheat coil, hot deck and two ventilation decks. Zones throughout the
building are served by constant volume mixing boxes, of which some include
cooling coils. We have been unable to figure out the most appropriate method
of modeling such system, as eQuest does not have an option for 'zonal
cooling'.

The existing system has been upgraded with the fan now served with a VFD
control, however, further to this improvement we would like to recommend a
total upgrade, with VAV boxes at the zones. In order to check the
feasibility of such ECM we would need to model the system as is...

Any suggestions on how we can proceed?

Thank you,

Hi Holly:

Noticed you have been asking a few questions lately.
Reply to ALL, so I can get your reply at my work as
work.

Sounds like you have a reheat system without a cold
deck reset. The DX unit (I am assuming with this size
building) is set at a constant cold deck temperature
of 55?F, so the VAV reheat are running wild. Put in a
cold deck reset and your heating (reheating) should
reduce dramatically.

Hi,
I'm trying to change the utility rates for my model from a rate that I
designed to the PG&E schedules.  When I choose the PG&E electricity schedule
A-6 from the library I get an error message that reads "The data just
modified will cause the following 1 error:  Utility Rate 'PG&E Elec Rate'
Energy-chg-sch:  Assigned building component 'PG&E Sch-A6 Schedule' is of an
incompatible type."  I don't understand what this error message is trying to
tell me or how to go about fixing it.  Any insight would be very helpful!

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200608011354.AA5459968pd80001185909@gard.com>

Hello,

 

I am modeling a building in Eagle, Colorado, and as of now all the HVAC
and Boilers are set up right, but the two boilers are running over 50%
of the time.  Still my KBTU/SF is at 150 for a 24,000 SF building.  I
was told that it should be around 50 or so.  Is this correct for a
building this size and for the location?

 

Thanks,

Holly

Dear All,

Does anyone know why the standard ASHRAE 90.1 2004 is not for sale anymore
on the ASHRAE store webpage?

http://resourcecenter.ashrae.org/store/ashrae/newstore.cgi?itemid=23261&view=item&categoryid=311

Suggestions on any other reliable stores where it can still be ordered from
are welcome.

Thanks,

Hello, 

 

 

I am working on a building that has different climatic conditions according to the fa?ade. 

On one fa?ade, humid ceramic pillars transform the hygrometric condition. The humidity increases and the temperature decreases. 

 

I would like to realize a simulation of this system in Trnsys with trnbuild or with DesignBuilder-Energy+.

 

 It could help us a lot.

 

Thank you in advance
