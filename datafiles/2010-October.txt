Subject: [Bldg-sim] Automatic Lighting Shutoff Mandatory Provision Question
Message-ID: <995130.56986.qm@web113116.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hello All,
 
I am confused on the mandatory provision 9.4.1.1 which states that building 
larger than 5000 ft2 shall have automatic control device. Does it mean 
that mid-rise and high rise building cannot claim for credit in occupancy 
sensors shown in Table G3.2 because their GFA is more than 5000 ft2 and only 
small office can claim for this credit? I am sure I am not interpreting this 
section correct since from what I read, other modelers  are claiming for savings 
for buildings with more than 5000 ft2 area for occupancy sensors even if 
mandatory requirements states that this is required which means baseline 
building will also have occupancy sensors.

Can someone correct me on this? 
 
Thank you,
 
 
C. Jaigath

Jaigath,

 

Appendix G allows us to take credit for automatic controls in addition
to (beyond) what's required in 9.4.1 for minimum compliance.  One of the
options here is to have programmable (time-of-day) shutoff for interior
lighting circuits, and you can infer from between Table G3.1 and G3.2 of
Appendix G that baseline models are taken to feature only such timeclock
controls for automatic shutoff.  Further, it's taken that the lighting
scheduling being kept identical between the proposed and baseline
adequately reflects the minimum requirements, so you aren't supposed to
try to explicitly model the programmable shutoff.  

 

If you have occupancy sensors throughout a building which only requires
programmable shutoff, that's an example of having automatic controls
beyond what 9.4.1 requires - and you'd get to take 10% off your proposed
LPD in all spaces where such short-term shutoff isn't already required
(per following section 9.4.1.2).

 

Note Table G3.2 also has a corresponding distinction between building
smaller than and larger than 5,000ft2 - offering more credit for
buildings using a means of automatic shutoff where no such controls are
even minimally required.

Dear all,

I've just started using IES-VE MicroFlow for CFD simulation. After I
complete the simulation there is only a program to visualize the result. *I
wonder how can I export the result as an ASCII or Text file?*

Thanks in Advance,

Mostapha Sadeghipour

PS: I'm not sure if there is a separate list for IES-VE users. Let me know
if I should post it somewhere else.

Chris,
First of all I want to save different simulation results for different
scenarios. Then I want to use other visualisation tools (e.g. Tecplot) for
my presentation. If there be another way to export the result it's still OK.
Thanks,
Mostapha

You can save the results file under a different name for each simulation.
I'm not sure the results file is compatable with any other tools. You should
contact IES to confirm that.
The CFD tool in IES is a simplified, dumbed-down tool which is not suitable
for large domains and only performs steady-state analysis not transient. It
is sometimes difficult to achieve convergence unless the model has been set
up very well.

G'Day,

you cannot - and I'm not sure why you'd expect to be able to? what you can
do though is save the entire project and ship that around, of course it's
only openable in IES. You can also create images etc.

what exactly are you trying to do?

That's right! Actually I've already saved my files in this way (*.CDF). But
I can not load the result back to the model! When I load these files in the
MicroFlo Visualization, it shows nothing but the basic geometry.

As far as I tried it's not compatible at all! :)

Thanks,
Mostapha

Ah, of course you can save each individual run so that you don't need to
repeat the simulation.

HI Mostapha,

I do not think txt or ASCII can be exported by Microflo. However, VE can
export .cdf  file. Bear in mind, the cdf file is encoded and therefore it is
not so friendly to be used by other program. I've heard that the format
could not be imported into Ecotect successfully due to the grid matching
issue. No harm to try, however, in your visualisation tools if it can import
.cdf.

If you are going to save different scenarios or export visible results
(either in picture or video format), VE can do it directly without exporting
any file actually.

Cheers,

Cheney

Good afternoon,

I think it's reasonable to be able to export the simulation result (whatever
it is) in a text file. In the simplest case what I want to do is to use the
numbers instead of images to analyze the result and I want to use another
software instead of IES-VE.

Thanks,
Mostapha

Hi,

interesting. what do you expect the file to look like? a 3-D grid of
locations with properties such as temp, air flow rate, humidity etc? what
resolution? Seems a nice idea but very far fetched at present. Like you'd
need some sort of standard or at least an agreement on formatting. Don't
hold your breath :)
You can open any previous .cfd file in the Microflo viewer by clicking on
file and open. works for me!

Not as complicated as you said. Just think of NIST FDS or Fluent result
files. There is some geometry/grid/results file and you can import them to
TecPlot. Sounds reasonable for me! Isn't it? :)

Well...

1. It is possible to export simulation result, but not in text format. Does
your 3rd party tool ask for txt?
2. It is possible to see numbers by using Cell Monitors in Microflo if you
define them in advance

Reasonable and likely are two different thing unfortunately.
why don't you ping IES Support (PAlly or David Geddes are very good). you
could also post on the IES forum (not the linkedinone, that's just
marketing) - you get to it from the help menu pulldown in VE-PRO

good luck - let me know if you get anywhere :)

Thank you very much?Nick. I really appreciate your help on this.
?
I really got confused with this when I got a commnet recently saying that the 
"baseline case per section 9.4.1.2 were not modeled" and was asked to revised 
the baseline. So I ended up with no savings. This is in conflict with Table 
G3.1.6 that you have pointed out which says that No automatic lighting controls 
shall be modeled in the baseline building design.?

Does it mean that I am wrong when I applied also 10% savings to my baseline? 
This is where?I got confused since 9.4.1.1.b?also mentions occupant sensor that 
shall turn lighting off within 30?mins of occupant leaving the space.?

Jaigath,
?
Appendix G allows us to take credit for automatic controls in addition to 
(beyond) what?s required in 9.4.1 for minimum compliance.? One of the options 
here is to have programmable (time-of-day) shutoff for interior lighting 
circuits, and you can infer from between Table G3.1 and G3.2 of Appendix G that 
baseline models are taken to feature only such timeclock controls for automatic 
shutoff.? Further, it?s taken that the lighting scheduling being kept identical 
between the proposed and baseline adequately reflects the minimum requirements, 
so you aren?t supposed to try to explicitly model the programmable shutoff. ?
?
If you have occupancy sensors throughout a building which only requires 
programmable shutoff, that?s an example of having automatic controls beyond what 
9.4.1 requires ? and you?d get to take 10% off your proposed LPD in all spaces 
where such short-term shutoff isn?t already required (per following section 
9.4.1.2).
?
Note Table G3.2 also has a corresponding distinction between building smaller 
than and larger than 5,000ft2 ? offering more credit for buildings using a means 
of automatic shutoff where no such controls are even minimally required.
?

Hello All,
?
I am confused on?the mandatory provision 9.4.1.1 which states that building 
larger than 5000 ft2 shall have automatic control device. Does it mean 
that?mid-rise and high rise building?cannot claim for credit in occupancy 
sensors shown in Table G3.2 because their GFA is more than 5000 ft2 and only 
small office can claim for this credit? I am sure I am not interpreting this 
section correct since from what I read, other modelers ?are claiming for savings 
for buildings with more than 5000 ft2 area for occupancy sensors even if 
mandatory requirements states that this is required which means baseline 
building will also have occupancy sensors.

Can someone correct me on this??

It is very important that any tool or service allows you to get your
data back out of it - i.e. it is not a one-way street allowing
data/model entry but not extraction.

Ideally open standards exist for such interchange, but if not some
simple table-based data dump is infinitely better than nothing.
Documentation of the tool's own file format is another way to achieve
interoperability.

I try very hard to avoid using tools where I have no way to get my
data back out. My experience of the building simulation area is
limited to date, but so far my impression is that the current
situation can best be described as 'poor' on this front. 

Mostapha is quite right to expect some kind of open data export.
Wouldn't it be nice to live in a world where we could easily shift
data back and forth between different modelling tools?

it is not an accurate statement to say that "the current situation can best
be described as poor on this front". Every simulation tool I use has a
feature where detailed reports on the input data are available.

There is a recognised exchange format that is acknowledged in commercial
CFD packages and post processors. It is CGNS. Unfortunately I have not
seen reference to it in building simulation CFD packages.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] District thermal energy
Message-ID: <4cab2e51.0da18e0a.4d63.5c8b@mx.google.com>

Hi friends,

 

 

I am working on a project which comes under "Required Treatment of District
Thermal Energy in LEED-NC version 2.2 and LEED for Schools", Version 1.0,
May 28, 2008 document.

 

My project is a hotel building (80% residential and 20% non-residential).
Hence as per my understanding the system type will be system 2 (residential,
as per table G3.1.1A and G3.1.1B).

 

I received a review comment which says that 

 

Per ASHRAE 90.1-2004, tables G3.1.1A and G3.1.1B, the baseline system for
this project shall be System #2 ? Packaged terminal heat pump. Also, since
the project includes more than 20,000 square feet of non-residential space
in addition to the large residential occupancy, all residential spaces
should be modeled in the Baseline as System Type # 4 (if the total
conditioned building area is less than 150,000 square feet) or System Type #
8 (if the total conditioned building area exceeds 150,000 square feet).
Please include the requested information on the Template and revise the
Tables 1.4, 1.8.1, 1.8.2 and the model as appropriate.

 

 

My questions are:

 

1.	The project will come under residential category or non-residential
category or both?? My system selection is correct??
2.	Do anyone has the backup or support which confirms the line "since
the project includes more than 20,000 square feet of non-residential space
in addition to the large residential occupancy,"?

 

Thanks in advance.

The hard and fast rule I follow is that baseline LPD?s are never to be messed with.  Any and all credit taken for lighting controls is a deduction of LPD (or sufficiently documented schedule adjustment, I suppose) in the proposed case. 

 

It can get confusing, but in specific spaces (i.e. classrooms), 9.4.1.2 may require occ. sensors.  In such a case, I don?t take a credit in the baseline (see hard/fast rule above), but instead remove the credit otherwise taken for that space in the proposed case.

I appreciate the answer to the following question:

With respect to LEED v3 commercial interior EA credit 3.1, how do we
approach the existing building HVAC system serving the entire building
including the tenant area seeking LEED certification. Shall we include
only new HVAC equipment serving the tenant area and consider the main
system as "EXISTING" in the energy modeling or we need to include the
building main system (e.g. chillers, pumps, air handling units). In
latter case, the entire building needs to be considered in the energy
modeling. Since the building main system may be somewhat old and not
very energy efficient, it may adversely affect the proposed energy
usage. In addition, in case the tenant improvement does not utilize any
new AC equipment (for instance only VAV boxes), what needs to be
included in the energy modeling to prove the compliance with 2007 ASHRAE
90.1 or 2008 Title-24.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Research Position Available
Message-ID: <00df01cb649e$f97b9f70$ec72de50$@ac.uk>

A position exists for a Research Associate to work on city-scale energy
simulation models of the built environment as part of the Energy Efficient
Cities initiative at Cambridge (www.eeci.cam.ac.uk). This initiative aims to
strengthen the UK's capacity to address energy demand reduction and
environmental impacts in cities through cross-disciplinary research in
building and transport technologies, district power systems, urban planning
and environmental impacts. Prospective applicants will work as part of the
EECi multidisciplinary team of researchers and collaboratively develop
models for investigating energy use and environmental conditions in urban
environments. 

The researcher will be responsible for developing physics-based models to
compute energy and environmental emissions of urban areas and assess the
impact of policy interventions involving building technologies, urban
infrastructures, and energy supply systems. Candidates applying for this
post must have a doctoral degree in a relevant engineering or science
discipline, and a strong background in energy modelling of buildings,
building physics, and relevant experience in extending physics-based models
on buildings to the urban scale. The candidate is also expected to have very
good computational skills - particularly in running models such as TRANSYS,
statistical packages in MATLAB (for sensitivity analysis and uncertainty
quantification), and/or numerical optimization models. The tenure of the
position will range from 1.5 years, renewable up to 3 years. Starting date
of the position will be agreed upon with selected candidates. 

The CHRIS /6 (Cover sheet for CVs) can be found at
http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/offices/hr/forms/ . Please send the appropriate

I actually take the credit for occ. sensor in both the baseline and proposed
case for such spaces that have a mandatory requirement for occupancy sensor
(e.g. classroom). The advantage is your total energy consumption is slightly
less, so when you are in border line cases where you are ever so slightly
less than the required percentage points for the next level of points it
helps. Much more advantageous to do it this way when you are doing a
school/university building.

Rohini,

 

While it's a minor point, I'd only caution that my "hard and fast rule"
is pretty much a directly from Table G3.1.6:  "No automatic lighting
controls ... shall be modeled in the baseline building design..."  That
said, if I were a reviewer I wouldn't have a problem with your approach.

 

While modeling occ. sensors in both cases would help the EUI of the
proposed model, not modeling occ sensors in both cases will mean your
baseline and proposed  HVAC systems have to deal with extra internal
loads, so presuming you have a better HVAC system in the proposed model,
I'd intuitively assume if anything a classroom-heavy school/university
might do better to not model occ. sensors in each model... I guess if
the results bear it out, go with the flow though =).

Thank you very much Nick. I really appreciate your help on this.

 
I really got confused with this when I got a commnet recently saying
that the "baseline case per section 9.4.1.2 were not modeled" and was
asked to revised the baseline. So I ended up with no savings. This is in
conflict with Table G3.1.6 that you have pointed out which says that No
automatic lighting controls shall be modeled in the baseline building
design. 

 

Does it mean that I am wrong when I applied also 10% savings to my
baseline? This is where I got confused since 9.4.1.1.b also mentions
occupant sensor that shall turn lighting off within 30 mins of occupant
leaving the space.

Jaigath,

 

Appendix G allows us to take credit for automatic controls in addition
to (beyond) what's required in 9.4.1 for minimum compliance.  One of the
options here is to have programmable (time-of-day) shutoff for interior
lighting circuits, and you can infer from between Table G3.1 and G3.2 of
Appendix G that baseline models are taken to feature only such timeclock
controls for automatic shutoff.  Further, it's taken that the lighting
scheduling being kept identical between the proposed and baseline
adequately reflects the minimum requirements, so you aren't supposed to
try to explicitly model the programmable shutoff.  

 

If you have occupancy sensors throughout a building which only requires
programmable shutoff, that's an example of having automatic controls
beyond what 9.4.1 requires - and you'd get to take 10% off your proposed
LPD in all spaces where such short-term shutoff isn't already required
(per following section 9.4.1.2).

 

Note Table G3.2 also has a corresponding distinction between building
smaller than and larger than 5,000ft2 - offering more credit for
buildings using a means of automatic shutoff where no such controls are
even minimally required.

Hello All,

 

I am confused on the mandatory provision 9.4.1.1 which states that
building larger than 5000 ft2 shall have automatic control device. Does
it mean that mid-rise and high rise building cannot claim for credit in

5000 ft2 and only small office can claim for this credit? I am sure I am
not interpreting this section correct since from what I read, other

Hi Mostapha,

Theoretically, it is possible to export a txt file with whole bunch of
information generated by a CFD simulation. Actually some commercial CFD
program, such as CFX and CFX-post, may fulfil your requirements.

Microflo in VE is only a simplified CFD module which targets on simple yet
straightforward building CFD analysis. With its visual outputs and bunch of
interested monitor points(quantitative data), I can generate pretty decent
report for the customers in the construction industry. We are not doing
research and seeking very in-depth analysis of the fluid mechanics (you will
not use Microflo if you are). From this point of view, I can't see any
improvement in Mircroflo in the near future. Liam, as the expert in this
area, please correct me if I've made the wrong judgement.

Cheers,

Cheney

Rohini,

 

I had a review comment that addressed this. They specifically told me
not to model occupancy sensors in the baseline and only take the 10%
reduction in the proposed model for rooms that have occupancy sensors
and are not required to have occupancy sensors per ASHRAE 90.1 9.4.1.1
and 9.4.1.2.

 

Also read Table G3.1 No. 6-g.

Rohini,

 

While it's a minor point, I'd only caution that my "hard and fast rule"
is pretty much a directly from Table G3.1.6:  "No automatic lighting
controls ... shall be modeled in the baseline building design..."  That
said, if I were a reviewer I wouldn't have a problem with your approach.

 

While modeling occ. sensors in both cases would help the EUI of the
proposed model, not modeling occ sensors in both cases will mean your
baseline and proposed  HVAC systems have to deal with extra internal
loads, so presuming you have a better HVAC system in the proposed model,
I'd intuitively assume if anything a classroom-heavy school/university
might do better to not model occ. sensors in each model... I guess if
the results bear it out, go with the flow though =).

I actually take the credit for occ. sensor in both the baseline and
proposed case for such spaces that have a mandatory requirement for
occupancy sensor (e.g. classroom). The advantage is your total energy
consumption is slightly less, so when you are in border line cases where
you are ever so slightly less than the required percentage points for
the next level of points it helps. Much more advantageous to do it this
way when you are doing a school/university building.

The hard and fast rule I follow is that baseline LPD's are never to be

deduction of LPD (or sufficiently documented schedule adjustment, I
suppose) in the proposed case. 

 

It can get confusing, but in specific spaces (i.e. classrooms), 9.4.1.2
may require occ. sensors.  In such a case, I don't take a credit in the
baseline (see hard/fast rule above), but instead remove the credit
otherwise taken for that space in the proposed case.

Thank you very much Nick. I really appreciate your help on this.

 
I really got confused with this when I got a commnet recently saying
that the "baseline case per section 9.4.1.2 were not modeled" and was
asked to revised the baseline. So I ended up with no savings. This is in
conflict with Table G3.1.6 that you have pointed out which says that No
automatic lighting controls shall be modeled in the baseline building
design. 

 

Does it mean that I am wrong when I applied also 10% savings to my
baseline? This is where I got confused since 9.4.1.1.b also mentions
occupant sensor that shall turn lighting off within 30 mins of occupant
leaving the space.

Question

Jaigath,

 

Appendix G allows us to take credit for automatic controls in addition
to (beyond) what's required in 9.4.1 for minimum compliance.  One of the
options here is to have programmable (time-of-day) shutoff for interior
lighting circuits, and you can infer from between Table G3.1 and G3.2 of
Appendix G that baseline models are taken to feature only such timeclock
controls for automatic shutoff.  Further, it's taken that the lighting
scheduling being kept identical between the proposed and baseline
adequately reflects the minimum requirements, so you aren't supposed to
try to explicitly model the programmable shutoff.  

 

If you have occupancy sensors throughout a building which only requires
programmable shutoff, that's an example of having automatic controls
beyond what 9.4.1 requires - and you'd get to take 10% off your proposed
LPD in all spaces where such short-term shutoff isn't already required
(per following section 9.4.1.2).

 

Note Table G3.2 also has a corresponding distinction between building
smaller than and larger than 5,000ft2 - offering more credit for
buildings using a means of automatic shutoff where no such controls are
even minimally required.

Hello All,

 

I am confused on the mandatory provision 9.4.1.1 which states that
building larger than 5000 ft2 shall have automatic control device. Does
it mean that mid-rise and high rise building cannot claim for credit in
occupancy sensors shown in Table G3.2 because their GFA is more than
5000 ft2 and only small office can claim for this credit? I am sure I am
not interpreting this section correct since from what I read, other
modelers  are claiming for savings for buildings with more than 5000 ft2
area for occupancy sensors even if mandatory requirements states that
this is required which means baseline building will also have occupancy
sensors.

 

Can someone correct me on this?

Neeraja,

Here are some answers;

Question 1:  The third footnote below table G3.1.1A says to use the
predominant condition when more than 1 system can be applied.

Question 2:  ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Exception G3.1.1a is the source of the 20,000

USGBC launches ADVANCED ENERGY MODELING FOR LEED, 

 

Technical Manual.

 

USGBC has developed the Advanced Energy Modeling for LEED, Technical Manual to guide the project teams and LEED reviewers on requirements and documentation for Whole Building Energy Simulation to Optimize Energy Performance of the building. The objective is to provide further information on EA Credit 1, streamline the LEED documentation process, and provide a greater degree of consistency for both LEED applications and reviewer comments. This manual should be considered a guiding document on EA Credit 1 requirements. The intended users of this manual are both LEED reviewers and applicants with intermediate or advanced understanding of energy modeling, referenced standards, and energy codes. This edition is primarily applicable to LEED for New Construction & Major Renovations v2.2,LEED Core & Shell v2.0 and LEED for Schools and can be adapted to apply to LEED Building Design and Construction 2009. The Manual includes chapters containing overview of references standards, key simulation outputs, submittal and documentation checklist, summary of applicable CIRs, verification of proposed savings, simulation input-output consistency, sample exceptional calculation methodologies accepted by USGBC including natural ventilation and many others. A book preview <http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=7795>  is available. Please visit USGBC website <http://www.usgbc.org/Store/PublicationsList_new.aspx?CMSPageID=1518>  for more information.

Hi again,

Just my last post on this topic!

There is a limitation when you want to add new cells to the "Cell Monitor"
list that seems to be a bug. When you want to add a new cell you have to
change *all X, Y and Z coordinates* for the new cell, otherwise you can not
add the point. So, for example you can not trace the changes in Z axis for
one point because X and Y coordinates are supposed to constant for the new
cells.

Thanks,
Mostapha

We just had a pretty in-depth discussion on this internally also - local
implementations of the code (for example, Chicago Building Code) have
added some confusion.  To add to what Nick said, the credits in table
G3.2 are only referenced in the lighting requirements in Table G3.1 and
are specifically listed for use in the proposed model for controls that
are not already required by the mandatory provisions of Section 9.  I've
always found it ironic that a Section G3.2 doesn't exist even though a
Table G3.2 does...but I digress...here is where we arrived internally:

 

Section 9.4.1 has 4 main parts - Whole building control, individual
space control, exterior lighting control and additional mandatory
controls.

 

-        9.4.1.1 requires an automatic whole building control capable of
shutting off lighting (with override capabilities allowed) for the
entire building based on either (a) time clock signal, (b) occupancy
sensors, or (c) some other control signal (like a BMS).  This applies to
all buildings over 5,000 SF.

-        9.4.1.2 requires an individual control for all spaces, either
manual or automatic.  For specific space types, automatic controls are
required: classrooms (except shop classrooms, laboratory classrooms, and
preschool - 12th grade classrooms), conference/meeting rooms, and
employee lunch and break rooms UNLESS those rooms have multiscene
control in which case they are also exempt from the automatic
requirement.  All other spaces are not required to have automatic
controls and can have either manual or automatic controls.  In addition,
those spaces where automatic controls are mandatory are NOT required to
be connected to other automatic lighting shutoff controls (i.e. the
whole building controls required by 9.4.1.1)

-        9.4.1.3 requires photocell or astronomical time clock control
of site lighting (with some nuances, but this is a safe simplification
of the requirements).

-        9.4.1.4 requires a number of specialty lighting installations
to have controls - most applicable to LEED is the requirement for all
task lighting to have an individual control.

 

The way I simplified this for our engineers is the following: any and
all spaces will have 2 levels of code-required control.  The first will
comply with 9.4.1.1 and the second will comply with 9.4.1.2.  As an
example, for a typical private office our engineers have been using wall
devices that have an occ sensor with a manual control.  If that is the
only controls that cover the private office, then the occ sensor
complies with 9.4.1.1 and the manual switch complies with 9.4.1.2; no
credit from Table G3.2 would be allowed since both control methods are
required by 9.4.1.  Now, if there is a time clock in the building and
the private office were connected to the time clock with the same wall
device the situation would be different: the time clock would comply
with 9.4.1.1 and the manual switch would comply with 9.4.1.2 leaving the
occupancy sensor as an additional control, eligible in Table G3.2 for a
10% LPD credit against the PROPOSED LPD factors.  For a classroom in a
community center, if the lighting is setup for multiple purposes and the
space is on the building time clock, then you just have compliance with
9.4.1.2 and 9.4.1.1 respectively.  If you put in an occ sensor (some
control logic required due to the multiscene) then you can take credit
for that sensor in Table G3.2.

 

I'm curious what you two think of this interpretation?

 

We even went so far in our discussion to look literally at the way
9.4.1.1 is worded and I believe that since the word "either" does not
imply mixed compliance then any given building must comply entirely with
one of the three options, not a mix of two.  Say a time clock for common
spaces with occ sensors for tenant leased space, for example, would not
comply with the most strict reading of the code.  That is quite literal,
but I've had code reviewers who have read other codes that literally
before...

Rohini,

 

While it's a minor point, I'd only caution that my "hard and fast rule"
is pretty much a directly from Table G3.1.6:  "No automatic lighting
controls ... shall be modeled in the baseline building design..."  That
said, if I were a reviewer I wouldn't have a problem with your approach.

 

While modeling occ. sensors in both cases would help the EUI of the
proposed model, not modeling occ sensors in both cases will mean your
baseline and proposed  HVAC systems have to deal with extra internal
loads, so presuming you have a better HVAC system in the proposed model,
I'd intuitively assume if anything a classroom-heavy school/university
might do better to not model occ. sensors in each model... I guess if
the results bear it out, go with the flow though =).

I actually take the credit for occ. sensor in both the baseline and
proposed case for such spaces that have a mandatory requirement for
occupancy sensor (e.g. classroom). The advantage is your total energy
consumption is slightly less, so when you are in border line cases where
you are ever so slightly less than the required percentage points for
the next level of points it helps. Much more advantageous to do it this
way when you are doing a school/university building.

It can get confusing, but in specific spaces (i.e. classrooms), 9.4.1.2
may require occ. sensors.  In such a case, I don't take a credit in the
baseline (see hard/fast rule above), but instead remove the credit
otherwise taken for that space in the proposed case.

Thank you very much Nick. I really appreciate your help on this.

 
I really got confused with this when I got a commnet recently saying
that the "baseline case per section 9.4.1.2 were not modeled" and was
asked to revised the baseline. So I ended up with no savings. This is in
conflict with Table G3.1.6 that you have pointed out which says that No
automatic lighting controls shall be modeled in the baseline building
design. 

 

Does it mean that I am wrong when I applied also 10% savings to my
baseline? This is where I got confused since 9.4.1.1.b also mentions
occupant sensor that shall turn lighting off within 30 mins of occupant
leaving the space.

Question

Jaigath,

 

Appendix G allows us to take credit for automatic controls in addition
to (beyond) what's required in 9.4.1 for minimum compliance.  One of the
options here is to have programmable (time-of-day) shutoff for interior
lighting circuits, and you can infer from between Table G3.1 and G3.2 of
Appendix G that baseline models are taken to feature only such timeclock
controls for automatic shutoff.  Further, it's taken that the lighting
scheduling being kept identical between the proposed and baseline
adequately reflects the minimum requirements, so you aren't supposed to
try to explicitly model the programmable shutoff.  

 

If you have occupancy sensors throughout a building which only requires
programmable shutoff, that's an example of having automatic controls
beyond what 9.4.1 requires - and you'd get to take 10% off your proposed
LPD in all spaces where such short-term shutoff isn't already required
(per following section 9.4.1.2).

 

Note Table G3.2 also has a corresponding distinction between building
smaller than and larger than 5,000ft2 - offering more credit for
buildings using a means of automatic shutoff where no such controls are
even minimally required.

Question

 

Hello All,

 

I am confused on the mandatory provision 9.4.1.1 which states that
building larger than 5000 ft2 shall have automatic control device. Does
it mean that mid-rise and high rise building cannot claim for credit in
occupancy sensors shown in Table G3.2 because their GFA is more than
5000 ft2 and only small office can claim for this credit? I am sure I am
not interpreting this section correct since from what I read, other
modelers  are claiming for savings for buildings with more than 5000 ft2
area for occupancy sensors even if mandatory requirements states that
this is required which means baseline building will also have occupancy
sensors.

 

Can someone correct me on this? 

 

Thank you,

Hi Brett,

 

Thanks for such a prompt response.

 

In my case total conditioned space is 2,69,920 sqft as per eQuest output
report LS-C command.

 

Out of which almost 36,000 sqft is non-residential space (corridors,
administrative offices, mechanical electrical spaces-all conditioned) and
rest (2,33,920 sqft) is residential space (guest rooms, dinning space,
prayer rooms etc).

Hence residential space is predominant. 

 

This means I need to select:

 

Case1: system-4 PSZ-HP for non-residential space and system-2 PTHP for
residential space.

 

OR 

 

Case2: System-4 for all spaces (residential and non-residential spaces)

 

OR

 

Case3: System-8 as the residential space is > 150000 sqft

 

OR 

 

Case4: System-2 for all spaces, because residential space is predominant

 

Kindly suggest. 

 

Thanks & Regards,

Hi friends,

 

 

I am working on a project which comes under "Required Treatment of District
Thermal Energy in LEED-NC version 2.2 and LEED for Schools", Version 1.0,
May 28, 2008 document.

 

My project is a hotel building (80% residential and 20% non-residential).
Hence as per my understanding the system type will be system 2 (residential,
as per table G3.1.1A and G3.1.1B).

 

I received a review comment which says that 

 

Per ASHRAE 90.1-2004, tables G3.1.1A and G3.1.1B, the baseline system for
this project shall be System #2 ? Packaged terminal heat pump. Also, since
the project includes more than 20,000 square feet of non-residential space
in addition to the large residential occupancy, all residential spaces
should be modeled in the Baseline as System Type # 4 (if the total
conditioned building area is less than 150,000 square feet) or System Type #
8 (if the total conditioned building area exceeds 150,000 square feet).
Please include the requested information on the Template and revise the
Tables 1.4, 1.8.1, 1.8.2 and the model as appropriate.

 

 

My questions are:

 

1.	The project will come under residential category or non-residential
category or both?? My system selection is correct??
2.	Do anyone has the backup or support which confirms the line "since
the project includes more than 20,000 square feet of non-residential space
in addition to the large residential occupancy,"?

 

Thanks in advance.

Does the USGBC allow energy savings credit for exterior lighting 
systems?  SS-8 provides a template for detailing the exterior 
lighting power savings over ASHRAE 90.1.  Can you use the savings 
noted on SS-8 to predict annual exterior lighting energy savings?

Thanks for any help with this question!

Jeremy,
 
I agree with Nick's explanation to Jaigath, below. A 10% LPD credit can
be taken in spaces that have occupancy sensors, except where occupancy
sensors are required (classrooms etc. per 9.4.1.2). It would make no
sense to allow energy savings only for spaces that have both time clock
and occupancy controls, since a space with both controls would provide
no additional energy savings over an occupancy sensor alone.
 
I also agree with Nick's comment to Rohini. Leave the baseline LPD alone
(turning lights off during unoccupied hours using the same schedule in
baseline and proposed) and take the 10% credit in the proposed where
applicable.

Bill

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Automatic Lighting Shutoff
MandatoryProvisionQuestion
 
We just had a pretty in-depth discussion on this internally also - local
implementations of the code (for example, Chicago Building Code) have
added some confusion.  To add to what Nick said, the credits in table
G3.2 are only referenced in the lighting requirements in Table G3.1 and
are specifically listed for use in the proposed model for controls that
are not already required by the mandatory provisions of Section 9.  I've
always found it ironic that a Section G3.2 doesn't exist even though a
Table G3.2 does...but I digress...here is where we arrived internally:
 
Section 9.4.1 has 4 main parts - Whole building control, individual
space control, exterior lighting control and additional mandatory
controls.
 
-        9.4.1.1 requires an automatic whole building control capable of
shutting off lighting (with override capabilities allowed) for the
entire building based on either (a) time clock signal, (b) occupancy
sensors, or (c) some other control signal (like a BMS).  This applies to
all buildings over 5,000 SF.
-        9.4.1.2 requires an individual control for all spaces, either
manual or automatic.  For specific space types, automatic controls are
required: classrooms (except shop classrooms, laboratory classrooms, and
preschool - 12th grade classrooms), conference/meeting rooms, and
employee lunch and break rooms UNLESS those rooms have multiscene
control in which case they are also exempt from the automatic
requirement.  All other spaces are not required to have automatic
controls and can have either manual or automatic controls.  In addition,
those spaces where automatic controls are mandatory are NOT required to
be connected to other automatic lighting shutoff controls (i.e. the
whole building controls required by 9.4.1.1)
-        9.4.1.3 requires photocell or astronomical time clock control
of site lighting (with some nuances, but this is a safe simplification
of the requirements).
-        9.4.1.4 requires a number of specialty lighting installations
to have controls - most applicable to LEED is the requirement for all
task lighting to have an individual control.
 
The way I simplified this for our engineers is the following: any and
all spaces will have 2 levels of code-required control.  The first will
comply with 9.4.1.1 and the second will comply with 9.4.1.2.  As an
example, for a typical private office our engineers have been using wall
devices that have an occ sensor with a manual control.  If that is the
only controls that cover the private office, then the occ sensor
complies with 9.4.1.1 and the manual switch complies with 9.4.1.2; no
credit from Table G3.2 would be allowed since both control methods are
required by 9.4.1.  Now, if there is a time clock in the building and
the private office were connected to the time clock with the same wall
device the situation would be different: the time clock would comply
with 9.4.1.1 and the manual switch would comply with 9.4.1.2 leaving the
occupancy sensor as an additional control, eligible in Table G3.2 for a
10% LPD credit against the PROPOSED LPD factors.  For a classroom in a
community center, if the lighting is setup for multiple purposes and the
space is on the building time clock, then you just have compliance with
9.4.1.2 and 9.4.1.1 respectively.  If you put in an occ sensor (some
control logic required due to the multiscene) then you can take credit
for that sensor in Table G3.2.
 
I'm curious what you two think of this interpretation?
 
We even went so far in our discussion to look literally at the way
9.4.1.1 is worded and I believe that since the word "either" does not
imply mixed compliance then any given building must comply entirely with
one of the three options, not a mix of two.  Say a time clock for common
spaces with occ sensors for tenant leased space, for example, would not
comply with the most strict reading of the code.  That is quite literal,
but I've had code reviewers who have read other codes that literally
before...

Rohini,
 
While it's a minor point, I'd only caution that my "hard and fast rule"
is pretty much a directly from Table G3.1.6:  "No automatic lighting
controls ... shall be modeled in the baseline building design..."  That
said, if I were a reviewer I wouldn't have a problem with your approach.
 
While modeling occ. sensors in both cases would help the EUI of the
proposed model, not modeling occ sensors in both cases will mean your
baseline and proposed  HVAC systems have to deal with extra internal
loads, so presuming you have a better HVAC system in the proposed model,
I'd intuitively assume if anything a classroom-heavy school/university
might do better to not model occ. sensors in each model... I guess if
the results bear it out, go with the flow though =).

I actually take the credit for occ. sensor in both the baseline and
proposed case for such spaces that have a mandatory requirement for
occupancy sensor (e.g. classroom). The advantage is your total energy
consumption is slightly less, so when you are in border line cases where
you are ever so slightly less than the required percentage points for
the next level of points it helps. Much more advantageous to do it this
way when you are doing a school/university building.

may require occ. sensors.  In such a case, I don't take a credit in the

Thank you very much Nick. I really appreciate your help on this.
 
I really got confused with this when I got a commnet recently saying
that the "baseline case per section 9.4.1.2 were not modeled" and was
asked to revised the baseline. So I ended up with no savings. This is in
conflict with Table G3.1.6 that you have pointed out which says that No
automatic lighting controls shall be modeled in the baseline building
design. 
 
Does it mean that I am wrong when I applied also 10% savings to my
baseline? This is where I got confused since 9.4.1.1.b also mentions
occupant sensor that shall turn lighting off within 30 mins of occupant
leaving the space.

Question
Jaigath,
 
Appendix G allows us to take credit for automatic controls in addition
to (beyond) what's required in 9.4.1 for minimum compliance.  One of the
options here is to have programmable (time-of-day) shutoff for interior
lighting circuits, and you can infer from between Table G3.1 and G3.2 of
Appendix G that baseline models are taken to feature only such timeclock
controls for automatic shutoff.  Further, it's taken that the lighting
scheduling being kept identical between the proposed and baseline
adequately reflects the minimum requirements, so you aren't supposed to
try to explicitly model the programmable shutoff.  
 
If you have occupancy sensors throughout a building which only requires
programmable shutoff, that's an example of having automatic controls
beyond what 9.4.1 requires - and you'd get to take 10% off your proposed
LPD in all spaces where such short-term shutoff isn't already required
(per following section 9.4.1.2).
 
Note Table G3.2 also has a corresponding distinction between building
smaller than and larger than 5,000ft2 - offering more credit for
buildings using a means of automatic shutoff where no such controls are
even minimally required.

Question
 
Hello All,
 
I am confused on the mandatory provision 9.4.1.1 which states that
building larger than 5000 ft2 shall have automatic control device. Does
it mean that mid-rise and high rise building cannot claim for credit in
occupancy sensors shown in Table G3.2 because their GFA is more than
5000 ft2 and only small office can claim for this credit? I am sure I am
not interpreting this section correct since from what I read, other
modelers  are claiming for savings for buildings with more than 5000 ft2
area for occupancy sensors even if mandatory requirements states that
this is required which means baseline building will also have occupancy
sensors.
 
Can someone correct me on this? 
 
Thank you,
 
 
C. Jaigath

Jeremy, 

 

Bill's condensed my thoughts very well.  This logic is further supported
by Table G3.2:

 

If, for your "typical office" case, one needs both a local occupancy
sensor and a timeclock on the circuit to demonstrate a savings in the
proposed model, why would table G3.2 have distinct lines for "occupancy
sensor and programmable timing control" as well as simply "occupancy
sensor?"  As you've noted, this table exists for the sole purpose of
doling out credit for proposed models, so there's no answer other than
one may be able to claim credit for occ. sensors without timer control.

 

More to the point, and as Bill notes - there's no savings gained with a
timeclock in combination with an occ. sensor that can't be achieved by
an occ. sensor alone (that's how I think of it anyway).  An occ. sensor
will however save you energy over a timeclock alone as you'll achieve
shutoff periods during working hours.  That's probably why the LPD
reductions in the two lines mentioned above are identical.  For these
reasons, I think we can consider occ. sensors alone to be "in addition
to" the minimum automatic shutoff requirements - inferred to be a
timeclock alone.  I reckon you can take the LPD credit in those spaces.

 

To your classroom example:  Yes, I've regularly interpreted spaces like
classrooms with automatic shutoff and multi-scene controls to be
qualified for a LPD reduction due to the corresponding exemption in
9.4.1.2.

 

Hope that helps!

 

~Nick

Jeremy,

 

I agree with Nick's explanation to Jaigath, below. A 10% LPD credit can
be taken in spaces that have occupancy sensors, except where occupancy
sensors are required (classrooms etc. per 9.4.1.2). It would make no
sense to allow energy savings only for spaces that have both time clock
and occupancy controls, since a space with both controls would provide
no additional energy savings over an occupancy sensor alone.

 

I also agree with Nick's comment to Rohini. Leave the baseline LPD alone
(turning lights off during unoccupied hours using the same schedule in
baseline and proposed) and take the 10% credit in the proposed where
applicable.

Bill

MandatoryProvisionQuestion

 

We just had a pretty in-depth discussion on this internally also - local
implementations of the code (for example, Chicago Building Code) have
added some confusion.  To add to what Nick said, the credits in table
G3.2 are only referenced in the lighting requirements in Table G3.1 and
are specifically listed for use in the proposed model for controls that
are not already required by the mandatory provisions of Section 9.  I've
always found it ironic that a Section G3.2 doesn't exist even though a
Table G3.2 does...but I digress...here is where we arrived internally:

 

Section 9.4.1 has 4 main parts - Whole building control, individual
space control, exterior lighting control and additional mandatory
controls.

 

-        9.4.1.1 requires an automatic whole building control capable of
shutting off lighting (with override capabilities allowed) for the
entire building based on either (a) time clock signal, (b) occupancy
sensors, or (c) some other control signal (like a BMS).  This applies to
all buildings over 5,000 SF.

-        9.4.1.2 requires an individual control for all spaces, either
manual or automatic.  For specific space types, automatic controls are
required: classrooms (except shop classrooms, laboratory classrooms, and
preschool - 12th grade classrooms), conference/meeting rooms, and
employee lunch and break rooms UNLESS those rooms have multiscene
control in which case they are also exempt from the automatic
requirement.  All other spaces are not required to have automatic
controls and can have either manual or automatic controls.  In addition,
those spaces where automatic controls are mandatory are NOT required to
be connected to other automatic lighting shutoff controls (i.e. the
whole building controls required by 9.4.1.1)

-        9.4.1.3 requires photocell or astronomical time clock control
of site lighting (with some nuances, but this is a safe simplification
of the requirements).

-        9.4.1.4 requires a number of specialty lighting installations
to have controls - most applicable to LEED is the requirement for all
task lighting to have an individual control.

 

The way I simplified this for our engineers is the following: any and
all spaces will have 2 levels of code-required control.  The first will
comply with 9.4.1.1 and the second will comply with 9.4.1.2.  As an
example, for a typical private office our engineers have been using wall
devices that have an occ sensor with a manual control.  If that is the
only controls that cover the private office, then the occ sensor
complies with 9.4.1.1 and the manual switch complies with 9.4.1.2; no
credit from Table G3.2 would be allowed since both control methods are
required by 9.4.1.  Now, if there is a time clock in the building and
the private office were connected to the time clock with the same wall
device the situation would be different: the time clock would comply
with 9.4.1.1 and the manual switch would comply with 9.4.1.2 leaving the
occupancy sensor as an additional control, eligible in Table G3.2 for a
10% LPD credit against the PROPOSED LPD factors.  For a classroom in a
community center, if the lighting is setup for multiple purposes and the
space is on the building time clock, then you just have compliance with
9.4.1.2 and 9.4.1.1 respectively.  If you put in an occ sensor (some
control logic required due to the multiscene) then you can take credit
for that sensor in Table G3.2.

 

I'm curious what you two think of this interpretation?

 

We even went so far in our discussion to look literally at the way
9.4.1.1 is worded and I believe that since the word "either" does not
imply mixed compliance then any given building must comply entirely with
one of the three options, not a mix of two.  Say a time clock for common
spaces with occ sensors for tenant leased space, for example, would not
comply with the most strict reading of the code.  That is quite literal,
but I've had code reviewers who have read other codes that literally
before...

Rohini,

 

While it's a minor point, I'd only caution that my "hard and fast rule"
is pretty much a directly from Table G3.1.6:  "No automatic lighting
controls ... shall be modeled in the baseline building design..."  That
said, if I were a reviewer I wouldn't have a problem with your approach.

 

While modeling occ. sensors in both cases would help the EUI of the
proposed model, not modeling occ sensors in both cases will mean your
baseline and proposed  HVAC systems have to deal with extra internal
loads, so presuming you have a better HVAC system in the proposed model,
I'd intuitively assume if anything a classroom-heavy school/university
might do better to not model occ. sensors in each model... I guess if
the results bear it out, go with the flow though =).

I actually take the credit for occ. sensor in both the baseline and
proposed case for such spaces that have a mandatory requirement for
occupancy sensor (e.g. classroom). The advantage is your total energy
consumption is slightly less, so when you are in border line cases where
you are ever so slightly less than the required percentage points for
the next level of points it helps. Much more advantageous to do it this
way when you are doing a school/university building.

It can get confusing, but in specific spaces (i.e. classrooms), 9.4.1.2
may require occ. sensors.  In such a case, I don't take a credit in the
baseline (see hard/fast rule above), but instead remove the credit

Thank you very much Nick. I really appreciate your help on this.

 
I really got confused with this when I got a commnet recently saying
that the "baseline case per section 9.4.1.2 were not modeled" and was
asked to revised the baseline. So I ended up with no savings. This is in
conflict with Table G3.1.6 that you have pointed out which says that No
automatic lighting controls shall be modeled in the baseline building
design. 

 

Does it mean that I am wrong when I applied also 10% savings to my
baseline? This is where I got confused since 9.4.1.1.b also mentions
occupant sensor that shall turn lighting off within 30 mins of occupant
leaving the space.

Question

Jaigath,

 

Appendix G allows us to take credit for automatic controls in addition
to (beyond) what's required in 9.4.1 for minimum compliance.  One of the
options here is to have programmable (time-of-day) shutoff for interior
lighting circuits, and you can infer from between Table G3.1 and G3.2 of
Appendix G that baseline models are taken to feature only such timeclock
controls for automatic shutoff.  Further, it's taken that the lighting
scheduling being kept identical between the proposed and baseline
adequately reflects the minimum requirements, so you aren't supposed to
try to explicitly model the programmable shutoff.  

 

If you have occupancy sensors throughout a building which only requires
programmable shutoff, that's an example of having automatic controls
beyond what 9.4.1 requires - and you'd get to take 10% off your proposed
LPD in all spaces where such short-term shutoff isn't already required
(per following section 9.4.1.2).

 

Note Table G3.2 also has a corresponding distinction between building
smaller than and larger than 5,000ft2 - offering more credit for
buildings using a means of automatic shutoff where no such controls are
even minimally required.

Question

 

Hello All,

 

I am confused on the mandatory provision 9.4.1.1 which states that
building larger than 5000 ft2 shall have automatic control device. Does
it mean that mid-rise and high rise building cannot claim for credit in
occupancy sensors shown in Table G3.2 because their GFA is more than
5000 ft2 and only small office can claim for this credit? I am sure I am
not interpreting this section correct since from what I read, other
modelers  are claiming for savings for buildings with more than 5000 ft2
area for occupancy sensors even if mandatory requirements states that
this is required which means baseline building will also have occupancy
sensors.

 

Can someone correct me on this? 

 

Thank you,

 

 

C. Jaigath

Chris, 

Yes. And in fact, they require to use the same values as in SSc8 if SSc8 is part of the credits you are applying for.

In essence, exterior lighting power in the Baseline must be determined using Table 9.4.5. 

Attention must be paid to non-tradable surfaces.

Hello all,

One of the requirements for EQ Credit 5 is to prove that the areas such as
the janitor's closet need to be negatively pressurized to a minimum
of 5Pa when doors are closed and 1Pa when doors are open. Generally, in
mechanical drawings, the cfm values are mentioned for exhaust fans.

I wanted some insight as to how this pressure difference information can be
obtained for both cases. Is there a straightforward calculation?

I am not sure whom at the US-DOE to contact but the EPW weather tapes
from the E+ Weather Data web site for Cadiz, Spain, and City Real,
Spain, have corrupt direct and diffuse radiation data. The total
horizontal radiation data make sense but direct and diffuse radiation
levels are somehow offset leading to non-vanishing values at night.

 

It would be wonderful if the DOE announced a contact email on the E+
Weather Data web site so that such bugs can be reported and fixed as
they can take quite some time to locate. If such a contact email already
exists, I did not find it.  Having said this, I am of course very
grateful that the DOE provides the files free of charge in the first
place!

I don't know what they were thinking when making these requirements, since

Obtaining a negative pressure difference also requires sealing the space.
 Door seals, and sealing walls.  If you exhaust 0.5 cfm/sf from a room with
chicken wire walls, you won't achieve any kind of measurable pressure
difference.

I usually steer clients away from this credit for this very reason

I've documented many EQc5s and have never been asked to prove anything.
For what it's worth, back when I used Contamw for stair pressurization
calcs, even a modest airflow of about 200 CFM per 3 foot door created
pressure differences of 0.1-0.15 in.  That's on the order of 25-30 PA.
So as long as you're in the range of 50 CFM per door, you'll be OK
(assuming the door undercut and crack are the only openings into the
room).

 

This is a major generalization, and there are a lot of parameters that
would need to be included to accurately calculate, but it helps me sleep
at night knowing 50 CFM / door usually meets this credit.

 

And Karen, I don't follow why you would steer clients away from this
credit.  Putting full height walls around janitor's closets and print
shops and negatively exhausting them is a good thing, right?

/ sq.ft. and no recirculation you'll be OK.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Negative pressure for EQ cr 5

 

Hello all,

 

One of the requirements for EQ Credit 5 is to prove that the areas such
as the janitor's closet need to be negatively pressurized to a minimum
of 5Pa when doors are closed and 1Pa when doors are open. Generally, in
mechanical drawings, the cfm values are mentioned for exhaust fans. 

 

I wanted some insight as to how this pressure difference information can
be obtained for both cases. Is there a straightforward calculation? 

 

 

Thanks,

Deepa

We have an exhaust rate of 1.31cfm/sf (or 75cfm per door) which exceeds the
minimum requirement greatly. According to what you have
mentioned, this should be good as far as creating a negative pressure.

Just to know, are there any equations to calculate this or is it best
determined by physical measurement?

Hi Deepa,

My two cents.

For your question, you need to know:

1. the air volume in room and its pressure

2. To achieve 5Pa, how much more air should be introduced -

Higher pressure x air volume in room/atmospheric pressure

Now you get the number for the  static condition... ;)

to maintain the pressure in a leaky room you have to pump in more air,
right?

3. from the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals:

Q = 2610 x A x (DP)1/2

? Q is the room leakage flow rate in cfm,
? 2610 is a conversion factor,
? A is the net open crack area of the room (generally not measurable), and
? DP is the differential pressure.
4. If you'd like to maintain certain pressure in the room, you need to
supply 2+3 first. When the pressure is established in dynamic condition,
you need to supply only 3 to maintain the pressure you want.

This is only the theoretical calculation for your reference.
Cheers,
Cheney

Nick,

 

Table G3.2 by itself also has to cover all possible situations, but it
is also only to provide credit for controls in addition to the mandatory
provisions.  I'll explain my view on those two issues separately. 

 

The intent of 9.4.1.1 from the 90.1 Users Manual is to ensure all
buildings "have an automatic control device that is capable of turning
off lighting in all spaces without human intervention."  This ensures
energy savings when the building is unoccupied.  Since occupants leave a
space during the day for various reasons, 9.4.1.2 exists to ensure that
unoccupied spaces during occupied hours have a means to save energy by
turning off the lights, either automatically or manually.  In addition,
that same device (if capable) can serve as the override (for safety
reasons) to turn lighting on in the space during unoccupied hours -
another mandatory provision of 9.4.1.2.  The way I read it, an occupancy
sensor alone cannot comply with both mandatory provisions because
9.4.1.2 requires an override to the automatic controls required by
9.4.1.1.  If the occ sensor is installed to comply with 9.4.1.1 and no
means is provided to override the control (such as a manual switch),
then compliance with 9.4.1.2 has not been demonstrated.  Once I have
satisfied 9.4.1.1 and 9.4.1.2 and only then can I look to Table G3.2 for
credit for automatic controls.  That is what Table G3.1(6)(g) says.

 

G3.2(1) only applies to buildings less than 5,000SF and non-24-hour
operations and gives 0% credit to larger buildings.  This is in line
with 9.4.1.1 that requires whole building control for buildings larger
than 5,000SF but not for those smaller.  G3.2(2) and G3.2(3) provide the
exact same credit for only an occ sensor or for an occ sensor and
programmable timing device (15% for buildings less than 5,000SF and
non-24-hr, 10% for others).  This "estimates" the savings from
compliance with 9.4.1.1 at approximately 5% for buildings larger than
5,000SF.  The 24-hour operation comment in G3.2 is due to exception (a)
to 9.4.1.1 since whole building control is not required for 24-hour
operations.

 

A situation I could see using G3.2(3) would be one of the more high-tech
security systems.  If the security system is tracking occupancy via
security card swipe-in/out records, then it would be capable of
determining that the building is unoccupied.  It could send a signal to
a relay panel to turn of the lighting.  That would comply with
9.4.1.1(c).  At that point, if every space were designed with manual
controls (except the three that require automatic controls) then the
manual controls would comply with 9.4.1.2.  If a time clock and
occupancy sensor were installed in addition, that would allow the credit
from G3.2; however, as you pointed out, no additional efficiency would
be gained by the combination of the two that was not achieved by the occ
sensor alone and indeed, Table G3.2 does not provide any additional
credit for installing both in this case where neither would be required
for compliance with the mandatory provisions.

 

I think it is an order of reading the code issue - since the mandatory
provisions come first, both 9.4.1.1 and 9.4.1.2 must be satisfied before
credit can be taken.  If the building only has a time clock, in that
typical office - there needs to be a local control for compliance with
9.4.1.2.  If that office has a switch that can function as an override
to the time clock AND a local control device, then that occ sensor would
indeed be eligible for the 10% credit.  But if the office just has the
time clock and the occ sensor - no other devices, then I don't see any
other way that 9.4.1.2 is satisfied except by the occ sensor, meaning it
is part of the mandatory provisions and not eligible for credit under
Table G3.2.

 

A single occ sensor with no other controls for the lighting in a space
(in buildings larger than 5,000SF) cannot comply with 9.4.1.1, 9.4.1.2
and earn credit under Table G3.2 since table G3.2 is for controls in
addition to the minimum.  Going back to the original question, I think
the issue arises somewhat from reviews only recently "cracking down" on
this part of the code...

 

Thoughts?

 

Separately, I also agree with the last comments - Baseline LPD is left
alone, always.  Table G3.2 only applies to the proposed design and is a
prescriptive alternative to having to use G2.5 Exceptional Calculations.

MandatoryProvisionQuestion

 

Jeremy, 

 

Bill's condensed my thoughts very well.  This logic is further supported
by Table G3.2:

 

If, for your "typical office" case, one needs both a local occupancy
sensor and a timeclock on the circuit to demonstrate a savings in the
proposed model, why would table G3.2 have distinct lines for "occupancy
sensor and programmable timing control" as well as simply "occupancy
sensor?"  As you've noted, this table exists for the sole purpose of
doling out credit for proposed models, so there's no answer other than
one may be able to claim credit for occ. sensors without timer control.

 

More to the point, and as Bill notes - there's no savings gained with a
timeclock in combination with an occ. sensor that can't be achieved by
an occ. sensor alone (that's how I think of it anyway).  An occ. sensor
will however save you energy over a timeclock alone as you'll achieve
shutoff periods during working hours.  That's probably why the LPD
reductions in the two lines mentioned above are identical.  For these
reasons, I think we can consider occ. sensors alone to be "in addition
to" the minimum automatic shutoff requirements - inferred to be a
timeclock alone.  I reckon you can take the LPD credit in those spaces.

 

To your classroom example:  Yes, I've regularly interpreted spaces like
classrooms with automatic shutoff and multi-scene controls to be
qualified for a LPD reduction due to the corresponding exemption in
9.4.1.2.

 

Hope that helps!

Jeremy,

 

I agree with Nick's explanation to Jaigath, below. A 10% LPD credit can
be taken in spaces that have occupancy sensors, except where occupancy
sensors are required (classrooms etc. per 9.4.1.2). It would make no
sense to allow energy savings only for spaces that have both time clock
and occupancy controls, since a space with both controls would provide
no additional energy savings over an occupancy sensor alone.

 

I also agree with Nick's comment to Rohini. Leave the baseline LPD alone
(turning lights off during unoccupied hours using the same schedule in
baseline and proposed) and take the 10% credit in the proposed where
applicable.

 

Regards,

Bill

MandatoryProvisionQuestion

 

We just had a pretty in-depth discussion on this internally also - local
implementations of the code (for example, Chicago Building Code) have
added some confusion.  To add to what Nick said, the credits in table
G3.2 are only referenced in the lighting requirements in Table G3.1 and
are specifically listed for use in the proposed model for controls that
are not already required by the mandatory provisions of Section 9.  I've
always found it ironic that a Section G3.2 doesn't exist even though a
Table G3.2 does...but I digress...here is where we arrived internally:

 

Section 9.4.1 has 4 main parts - Whole building control, individual
space control, exterior lighting control and additional mandatory
controls.

 

-        9.4.1.1 requires an automatic whole building control capable of
shutting off lighting (with override capabilities allowed) for the
entire building based on either (a) time clock signal, (b) occupancy
sensors, or (c) some other control signal (like a BMS).  This applies to
all buildings over 5,000 SF.

-        9.4.1.2 requires an individual control for all spaces, either
manual or automatic.  For specific space types, automatic controls are
required: classrooms (except shop classrooms, laboratory classrooms, and
preschool - 12th grade classrooms), conference/meeting rooms, and
employee lunch and break rooms UNLESS those rooms have multiscene
control in which case they are also exempt from the automatic
requirement.  All other spaces are not required to have automatic
controls and can have either manual or automatic controls.  In addition,
those spaces where automatic controls are mandatory are NOT required to
be connected to other automatic lighting shutoff controls (i.e. the
whole building controls required by 9.4.1.1)

-        9.4.1.3 requires photocell or astronomical time clock control
of site lighting (with some nuances, but this is a safe simplification
of the requirements).

-        9.4.1.4 requires a number of specialty lighting installations
to have controls - most applicable to LEED is the requirement for all
task lighting to have an individual control.

 

The way I simplified this for our engineers is the following: any and
all spaces will have 2 levels of code-required control.  The first will
comply with 9.4.1.1 and the second will comply with 9.4.1.2.  As an
example, for a typical private office our engineers have been using wall
devices that have an occ sensor with a manual control.  If that is the
only controls that cover the private office, then the occ sensor
complies with 9.4.1.1 and the manual switch complies with 9.4.1.2; no
credit from Table G3.2 would be allowed since both control methods are
required by 9.4.1.  Now, if there is a time clock in the building and
the private office were connected to the time clock with the same wall
device the situation would be different: the time clock would comply
with 9.4.1.1 and the manual switch would comply with 9.4.1.2 leaving the
occupancy sensor as an additional control, eligible in Table G3.2 for a
10% LPD credit against the PROPOSED LPD factors.  For a classroom in a
community center, if the lighting is setup for multiple purposes and the
space is on the building time clock, then you just have compliance with
9.4.1.2 and 9.4.1.1 respectively.  If you put in an occ sensor (some
control logic required due to the multiscene) then you can take credit
for that sensor in Table G3.2.

 

I'm curious what you two think of this interpretation?

 

We even went so far in our discussion to look literally at the way
9.4.1.1 is worded and I believe that since the word "either" does not
imply mixed compliance then any given building must comply entirely with
one of the three options, not a mix of two.  Say a time clock for common
spaces with occ sensors for tenant leased space, for example, would not
comply with the most strict reading of the code.  That is quite literal,
but I've had code reviewers who have read other codes that literally
before...

Rohini,

 

While it's a minor point, I'd only caution that my "hard and fast rule"
is pretty much a directly from Table G3.1.6:  "No automatic lighting
controls ... shall be modeled in the baseline building design..."  That
said, if I were a reviewer I wouldn't have a problem with your approach.

 

While modeling occ. sensors in both cases would help the EUI of the
proposed model, not modeling occ sensors in both cases will mean your
baseline and proposed  HVAC systems have to deal with extra internal
loads, so presuming you have a better HVAC system in the proposed model,
I'd intuitively assume if anything a classroom-heavy school/university
might do better to not model occ. sensors in each model... I guess if
the results bear it out, go with the flow though =).

I actually take the credit for occ. sensor in both the baseline and
proposed case for such spaces that have a mandatory requirement for
occupancy sensor (e.g. classroom). The advantage is your total energy
consumption is slightly less, so when you are in border line cases where
you are ever so slightly less than the required percentage points for
the next level of points it helps. Much more advantageous to do it this
way when you are doing a school/university building.

It can get confusing, but in specific spaces (i.e. classrooms), 9.4.1.2
may require occ. sensors.  In such a case, I don't take a credit in the

Thank you very much Nick. I really appreciate your help on this.

 
I really got confused with this when I got a commnet recently saying
that the "baseline case per section 9.4.1.2 were not modeled" and was
asked to revised the baseline. So I ended up with no savings. This is in
conflict with Table G3.1.6 that you have pointed out which says that No
automatic lighting controls shall be modeled in the baseline building
design. 

 

Does it mean that I am wrong when I applied also 10% savings to my
baseline? This is where I got confused since 9.4.1.1.b also mentions
occupant sensor that shall turn lighting off within 30 mins of occupant
leaving the space.

Jaigath,

 

Appendix G allows us to take credit for automatic controls in addition
to (beyond) what's required in 9.4.1 for minimum compliance.  One of the
options here is to have programmable (time-of-day) shutoff for interior
lighting circuits, and you can infer from between Table G3.1 and G3.2 of
Appendix G that baseline models are taken to feature only such timeclock
controls for automatic shutoff.  Further, it's taken that the lighting
scheduling being kept identical between the proposed and baseline
adequately reflects the minimum requirements, so you aren't supposed to
try to explicitly model the programmable shutoff.  

 

If you have occupancy sensors throughout a building which only requires
programmable shutoff, that's an example of having automatic controls
beyond what 9.4.1 requires - and you'd get to take 10% off your proposed
LPD in all spaces where such short-term shutoff isn't already required
(per following section 9.4.1.2).

 

Note Table G3.2 also has a corresponding distinction between building
smaller than and larger than 5,000ft2 - offering more credit for
buildings using a means of automatic shutoff where no such controls are
even minimally required.

Hello All,

 

I am confused on the mandatory provision 9.4.1.1 which states that
building larger than 5000 ft2 shall have automatic control device. Does
it mean that mid-rise and high rise building cannot claim for credit in
occupancy sensors shown in Table G3.2 because their GFA is more than
5000 ft2 and only small office can claim for this credit? I am sure I am
not interpreting this section correct since from what I read, other
modelers  are claiming for savings for buildings with more than 5000 ft2
area for occupancy sensors even if mandatory requirements states that
this is required which means baseline building will also have occupancy
sensors.

 

Can someone correct me on this?

Hi Jeremy,

 

No offense taken, but part of your response looks something like a straw
man argument from my end, so let me clarify my position...

 

When I said "occ. sensor only,"  I was simply referencing your typical
office case containing both an occ. sensor with manual control.  I did
not intend to imply something violating 9.4.1.2.  From that, I'd agree
with 95% of your post below.

 

I also fully agree that all mandatory provisions are to be met before
one can even begin an Appendix G performance rating model - it's plain
as day in G1.2, so let's remove that from the discussion.

 

We do differ in our interpretations however, and I believe I understand
where you're coming from... 

 

Let's take a hypothetical case to illustrate: 

 

I've developed a model for a design featuring enclosed offices with
manual control, occupancy sensors, and no timeclock.  I have taken a 10%
LPD deduction in these spaces as prescribed in Table G3.2, line #2, and
have stated so in my LEED 3.0 EAp2 spreadsheet with explicit clarity.
If it's a big project, perhaps I've also uploaded a supplementary scan
of my takeoff highlighting the areas where credit for automatic controls
is/isn't being taken.

 

Now let's say you're my LEED reviewer, and would like to challenge my
interpretation:

 

You claim an occupancy sensor with manual override does not qualify for
Table G3.2's deduction because this control scheme is not (quoting
TG3.1.6.g)"...automatic lighting controls in addition to those required
for minimum code compliance under Section 9.4.1," emphasizing the
underlined phrase.  

 

You go on to state if we were to add a timeclock to the equation, then
the design would qualify, because the timeclock would satisfy the
mandatory provisions of Section 9.4, allowing the occupancy sensor to be
classified as "in addition to."

 

My response:  

 

The 90.1 User's Manual states: "The proposed building may include power
adjustment credits for occupant sensors or automatic time switches when
they are not already required by the mandatory provisions."  These
occupancy sensors are not required devices, but merely one of three
options to achieve required automatic shutoff.

 

The only times occupancy sensors are required as a device by the
mandatory provisions are as outlined in section 9.4.1.2.a.  Enclosed
offices are not on that list.

 

The proposed design for these offices:

1.       Satisfies the requirements of providing automatic shutoff in
9.4.1.1,

2.       Satisfies the requirements of space control in 9.4.1.2, and is
further not required to have a control device capable of automatic
shutoff and

3.       Provides shutoff controls in addition to those required by the
above sections for a minimally compliant design.

 

A minimally compliant design would use the timeclock option, providing
automatic shutoff only during unoccupied hours.  The proposed design
however goes beyond the minimum requirements by additionally providing
automatic shutoff during occupied hours.  As such, for the context of
the Performance Rating Method prescribed in Appendix G, the proposed
design does indeed provide "automatic lighting controls in addition to
those required for minimum code compliance under section 9.4.1."

 

I might also point out adding a timeclock to the office circuit would
save negligible-to-zero energy and would be a waste of resources...
probably would kill a few trees or sink a few polar bear homes if you
crunch the numbers right ;).  In all seriousness though, if you take
your current interpretation to the sidewalk's end, I think you'll find
you pretty much have to have redundant, functionally pointless controls
to ever demonstrate a credit via Table G3.2.  I think it boils down to
whether the same device can or can't simultaneously satisfy requirements
within 9.4.1 and also provide an energy savings beyond "those required
for minimum compliance."  That last phrase is not in any glossary, so
it's all up to you!

 

To the "cracking down" comment:  I'm a diehard optimist, but I like to
think all of us (reviewers, modelers, designers, building owners) are
all doing the best we can and trying to play by the rules of the game.
The new compliance documentation for LEED v3 is definitely a
game-changer in that we must now document items we had to do only
voluntarily in the past, but despite the extra time required (who enjoys
documentation anyway?) I suppose it does level the playing field a bit
for those of us trying to do right by the rules.  **

 

Anyway that's my take - and you're right to observe this is all
ultimately our individual views/interpretations, which may or may not
align with the reviewers... with precedents all but tossed out the
window with LEED v3, there's less for us to stand on beyond our own
logic during a review (I've found the User's Manual generally helpful
though)!

 

Yours,


~Nick

 

PS:  Thanks to everyone involved for sharing their thoughts!  I
sincerely enjoy these discussions and think as a group we can grow with
them.  I've found historically that writing out my thoughts this way can
ultimately galvanize/refine my own positions, but also sometimes changes
my stance completely, so I enjoy it as an exercise (time allowing)!  If
I'm disagreeing with anyone, it's only with complete respect for others
and to seek a better answer.

 

**) I'm writing this in the context of an 'ethical position statement'
of sorts regarding energy modeling in general and for LEED... may be
interesting reading to some:

MandatoryProvisionQuestion

 

Nick,

 

Table G3.2 by itself also has to cover all possible situations, but it
is also only to provide credit for controls in addition to the mandatory
provisions.  I'll explain my view on those two issues separately. 

 

The intent of 9.4.1.1 from the 90.1 Users Manual is to ensure all
buildings "have an automatic control device that is capable of turning
off lighting in all spaces without human intervention."  This ensures
energy savings when the building is unoccupied.  Since occupants leave a
space during the day for various reasons, 9.4.1.2 exists to ensure that
unoccupied spaces during occupied hours have a means to save energy by
turning off the lights, either automatically or manually.  In addition,
that same device (if capable) can serve as the override (for safety
reasons) to turn lighting on in the space during unoccupied hours -
another mandatory provision of 9.4.1.2.  The way I read it, an occupancy
sensor alone cannot comply with both mandatory provisions because
9.4.1.2 requires an override to the automatic controls required by
9.4.1.1.  If the occ sensor is installed to comply with 9.4.1.1 and no
means is provided to override the control (such as a manual switch),
then compliance with 9.4.1.2 has not been demonstrated.  Once I have
satisfied 9.4.1.1 and 9.4.1.2 and only then can I look to Table G3.2 for
credit for automatic controls.  That is what Table G3.1(6)(g) says.

 

G3.2(1) only applies to buildings less than 5,000SF and non-24-hour
operations and gives 0% credit to larger buildings.  This is in line
with 9.4.1.1 that requires whole building control for buildings larger
than 5,000SF but not for those smaller.  G3.2(2) and G3.2(3) provide the
exact same credit for only an occ sensor or for an occ sensor and
programmable timing device (15% for buildings less than 5,000SF and
non-24-hr, 10% for others).  This "estimates" the savings from
compliance with 9.4.1.1 at approximately 5% for buildings larger than
5,000SF.  The 24-hour operation comment in G3.2 is due to exception (a)
to 9.4.1.1 since whole building control is not required for 24-hour
operations.

 

A situation I could see using G3.2(3) would be one of the more high-tech
security systems.  If the security system is tracking occupancy via
security card swipe-in/out records, then it would be capable of
determining that the building is unoccupied.  It could send a signal to
a relay panel to turn of the lighting.  That would comply with
9.4.1.1(c).  At that point, if every space were designed with manual
controls (except the three that require automatic controls) then the
manual controls would comply with 9.4.1.2.  If a time clock and
occupancy sensor were installed in addition, that would allow the credit
from G3.2; however, as you pointed out, no additional efficiency would
be gained by the combination of the two that was not achieved by the occ
sensor alone and indeed, Table G3.2 does not provide any additional
credit for installing both in this case where neither would be required
for compliance with the mandatory provisions.

 

I think it is an order of reading the code issue - since the mandatory
provisions come first, both 9.4.1.1 and 9.4.1.2 must be satisfied before
credit can be taken.  If the building only has a time clock, in that
typical office - there needs to be a local control for compliance with
9.4.1.2.  If that office has a switch that can function as an override
to the time clock AND a local control device, then that occ sensor would
indeed be eligible for the 10% credit.  But if the office just has the
time clock and the occ sensor - no other devices, then I don't see any
other way that 9.4.1.2 is satisfied except by the occ sensor, meaning it
is part of the mandatory provisions and not eligible for credit under
Table G3.2.

 

A single occ sensor with no other controls for the lighting in a space
(in buildings larger than 5,000SF) cannot comply with 9.4.1.1, 9.4.1.2
and earn credit under Table G3.2 since table G3.2 is for controls in
addition to the minimum.  Going back to the original question, I think
the issue arises somewhat from reviews only recently "cracking down" on
this part of the code...

 

Thoughts?

 

Separately, I also agree with the last comments - Baseline LPD is left
alone, always.  Table G3.2 only applies to the proposed design and is a
prescriptive alternative to having to use G2.5 Exceptional Calculations.

Jeremy, 

 

Bill's condensed my thoughts very well.  This logic is further supported
by Table G3.2:

 

If, for your "typical office" case, one needs both a local occupancy
sensor and a timeclock on the circuit to demonstrate a savings in the
proposed model, why would table G3.2 have distinct lines for "occupancy
sensor and programmable timing control" as well as simply "occupancy
sensor?"  As you've noted, this table exists for the sole purpose of
doling out credit for proposed models, so there's no answer other than
one may be able to claim credit for occ. sensors without timer control.

 

More to the point, and as Bill notes - there's no savings gained with a
timeclock in combination with an occ. sensor that can't be achieved by
an occ. sensor alone (that's how I think of it anyway).  An occ. sensor
will however save you energy over a timeclock alone as you'll achieve
shutoff periods during working hours.  That's probably why the LPD
reductions in the two lines mentioned above are identical.  For these
reasons, I think we can consider occ. sensors alone to be "in addition
to" the minimum automatic shutoff requirements - inferred to be a
timeclock alone.  I reckon you can take the LPD credit in those spaces.

 

To your classroom example:  Yes, I've regularly interpreted spaces like
classrooms with automatic shutoff and multi-scene controls to be
qualified for a LPD reduction due to the corresponding exemption in
9.4.1.2.

 

Hope that helps!

Jeremy,

 

I agree with Nick's explanation to Jaigath, below. A 10% LPD credit can
be taken in spaces that have occupancy sensors, except where occupancy
sensors are required (classrooms etc. per 9.4.1.2). It would make no
sense to allow energy savings only for spaces that have both time clock
and occupancy controls, since a space with both controls would provide
no additional energy savings over an occupancy sensor alone.

 

I also agree with Nick's comment to Rohini. Leave the baseline LPD alone
(turning lights off during unoccupied hours using the same schedule in
baseline and proposed) and take the 10% credit in the proposed where
applicable.

Bill

We just had a pretty in-depth discussion on this internally also - local
implementations of the code (for example, Chicago Building Code) have
added some confusion.  To add to what Nick said, the credits in table
G3.2 are only referenced in the lighting requirements in Table G3.1 and
are specifically listed for use in the proposed model for controls that
are not already required by the mandatory provisions of Section 9.  I've
always found it ironic that a Section G3.2 doesn't exist even though a
Table G3.2 does...but I digress...here is where we arrived internally:

 

Section 9.4.1 has 4 main parts - Whole building control, individual
space control, exterior lighting control and additional mandatory
controls.

 

-        9.4.1.1 requires an automatic whole building control capable of
shutting off lighting (with override capabilities allowed) for the
entire building based on either (a) time clock signal, (b) occupancy
sensors, or (c) some other control signal (like a BMS).  This applies to
all buildings over 5,000 SF.

-        9.4.1.2 requires an individual control for all spaces, either
manual or automatic.  For specific space types, automatic controls are
required: classrooms (except shop classrooms, laboratory classrooms, and
preschool - 12th grade classrooms), conference/meeting rooms, and
employee lunch and break rooms UNLESS those rooms have multiscene
control in which case they are also exempt from the automatic
requirement.  All other spaces are not required to have automatic
controls and can have either manual or automatic controls.  In addition,
those spaces where automatic controls are mandatory are NOT required to
be connected to other automatic lighting shutoff controls (i.e. the
whole building controls required by 9.4.1.1)

-        9.4.1.3 requires photocell or astronomical time clock control
of site lighting (with some nuances, but this is a safe simplification
of the requirements).

-        9.4.1.4 requires a number of specialty lighting installations
to have controls - most applicable to LEED is the requirement for all
task lighting to have an individual control.

 

The way I simplified this for our engineers is the following: any and
all spaces will have 2 levels of code-required control.  The first will
comply with 9.4.1.1 and the second will comply with 9.4.1.2.  As an
example, for a typical private office our engineers have been using wall
devices that have an occ sensor with a manual control.  If that is the
only controls that cover the private office, then the occ sensor
complies with 9.4.1.1 and the manual switch complies with 9.4.1.2; no
credit from Table G3.2 would be allowed since both control methods are
required by 9.4.1.  Now, if there is a time clock in the building and
the private office were connected to the time clock with the same wall
device the situation would be different: the time clock would comply
with 9.4.1.1 and the manual switch would comply with 9.4.1.2 leaving the
occupancy sensor as an additional control, eligible in Table G3.2 for a
10% LPD credit against the PROPOSED LPD factors.  For a classroom in a
community center, if the lighting is setup for multiple purposes and the
space is on the building time clock, then you just have compliance with
9.4.1.2 and 9.4.1.1 respectively.  If you put in an occ sensor (some
control logic required due to the multiscene) then you can take credit
for that sensor in Table G3.2.

 

I'm curious what you two think of this interpretation?

 

We even went so far in our discussion to look literally at the way
9.4.1.1 is worded and I believe that since the word "either" does not
imply mixed compliance then any given building must comply entirely with
one of the three options, not a mix of two.  Say a time clock for common
spaces with occ sensors for tenant leased space, for example, would not
comply with the most strict reading of the code.  That is quite literal,
but I've had code reviewers who have read other codes that literally
before...

Rohini,

 

While it's a minor point, I'd only caution that my "hard and fast rule"
is pretty much a directly from Table G3.1.6:  "No automatic lighting
controls ... shall be modeled in the baseline building design..."  That
said, if I were a reviewer I wouldn't have a problem with your approach.

 

While modeling occ. sensors in both cases would help the EUI of the
proposed model, not modeling occ sensors in both cases will mean your
baseline and proposed  HVAC systems have to deal with extra internal
loads, so presuming you have a better HVAC system in the proposed model,
I'd intuitively assume if anything a classroom-heavy school/university
might do better to not model occ. sensors in each model... I guess if
the results bear it out, go with the flow though =).

I actually take the credit for occ. sensor in both the baseline and
proposed case for such spaces that have a mandatory requirement for
occupancy sensor (e.g. classroom). The advantage is your total energy
consumption is slightly less, so when you are in border line cases where
you are ever so slightly less than the required percentage points for
the next level of points it helps. Much more advantageous to do it this
way when you are doing a school/university building.

It can get confusing, but in specific spaces (i.e. classrooms), 9.4.1.2
may require occ. sensors.  In such a case, I don't take a credit in the
baseline (see hard/fast rule above), but instead remove the credit
otherwise taken for that space in the proposed case.

Thank you very much Nick. I really appreciate your help on this.

 
I really got confused with this when I got a commnet recently saying
that the "baseline case per section 9.4.1.2 were not modeled" and was
asked to revised the baseline. So I ended up with no savings. This is in
conflict with Table G3.1.6 that you have pointed out which says that No
automatic lighting controls shall be modeled in the baseline building
design. 

 

Does it mean that I am wrong when I applied also 10% savings to my
baseline? This is where I got confused since 9.4.1.1.b also mentions
occupant sensor that shall turn lighting off within 30 mins of occupant
leaving the space.

Jaigath,

 

Appendix G allows us to take credit for automatic controls in addition
to (beyond) what's required in 9.4.1 for minimum compliance.  One of the
options here is to have programmable (time-of-day) shutoff for interior
lighting circuits, and you can infer from between Table G3.1 and G3.2 of
Appendix G that baseline models are taken to feature only such timeclock
controls for automatic shutoff.  Further, it's taken that the lighting
scheduling being kept identical between the proposed and baseline
adequately reflects the minimum requirements, so you aren't supposed to
try to explicitly model the programmable shutoff.  

 

If you have occupancy sensors throughout a building which only requires
programmable shutoff, that's an example of having automatic controls
beyond what 9.4.1 requires - and you'd get to take 10% off your proposed
LPD in all spaces where such short-term shutoff isn't already required
(per following section 9.4.1.2).

 

Note Table G3.2 also has a corresponding distinction between building
smaller than and larger than 5,000ft2 - offering more credit for
buildings using a means of automatic shutoff where no such controls are
even minimally required.

Question

 

Hello All,

 

I am confused on the mandatory provision 9.4.1.1 which states that
building larger than 5000 ft2 shall have automatic control device. Does
it mean that mid-rise and high rise building cannot claim for credit in
occupancy sensors shown in Table G3.2 because their GFA is more than
5000 ft2 and only small office can claim for this credit? I am sure I am
not interpreting this section correct since from what I read, other
modelers  are claiming for savings for buildings with more than 5000 ft2
area for occupancy sensors even if mandatory requirements states that
this is required which means baseline building will also have occupancy
sensors.

 

Can someone correct me on this? 

 

Thank you,

 

 

C. Jaigath

Hi all,



I am looking for incentive rates from electricity supply companies in terms
of lighting retrofits. So, when I am opting for an option of changing 3-lamp
T12 magnetic ballast lighting fixture to 2-lamp super T8 electronic ballast
fixture, will this be considered under lighting retrofit or replacement?


Also, will the incentive include delamping rebate also?


Thanks in advance.

Going from a 3-lamp to a 2-lamp set up would involve changing out the
fixture, and will typically be done for the entire space together. Such a
replacement of lighting, where all/many fixtures being replaced are still
functioning, is classified as a retrofit. In general, a retrofit involves
replacement before the end of life. The contrasting scenario is called
replace-on-fail (aka replace on burnout) where you change lamps/ fixtures as
they die out. (Not typically done for lighting). What is described here is
therefore a retrofit.

Utility rebate structures vary by utility and are decided based on utility
budgets, program structure (simple rebate versus custom lighting program for
example), aggressiveness of energy savings goals and cost of the retrofit
among other things. A common scenario for commercial lighting retrofits is a
simple rebate program with a set incentive per fixture. This would typically
cover a portion of the expected cost including materials and labor (and any
additional O&M)-- the calculation of which should include delamping-- but
only a portion is covered by rebate. Let's say the new lighting fixture cost
is $60 and labor is $20. That's $80 upgrade cost. Let's say the utility pays
$50 rebate. Whether this rebate covers the cost of delamping per se is
arguable but the 'basis' for calculating the rebate should include it.

Hope that helps.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] space type breakdown in office buildings
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=k64REMp6tA-yGyT4JNv5Vp+YyMGU9+CfAQuP8@mail.gmail.com>

All,

I'm looking for a credible source for representative space type breakdown in
typical office buildings, presumably based on data collected from existing
office buildings. Preferably for california, but nationwide will do too. An
example breakdown I have looks like this:


Net Area, [sf] % of Floor  Open Offices 21,675 63.6%  Private Offices 5,934
17.4%  Conference Rooms 1,810 5.3%  Corridor 600 1.8%  Printer/Copier 214
0.6%  Restrooms 685 2.0%  Elevator Lobby 333 1.0%  Mechanical/Electrical 645
1.9%  Stairs 306 0.9%  Storage 118 0.3%  Break Room 1690 5.0%  Janitor 77
0.2%
Thanks,
Ramana.

Hi Ramana,

A quick source of info would be to select an office building in the eQUEST
wizard and see what the breakdowns are in it. I'm sure the developer's used
a reliable source of info to generate their numbers and they would probably
even tell you what it is if you asked.

Best,

Carol

There might also be some specific terminology/procedures used by the state
program you are looking at as far as retrofit/replacement.



For instance in ComEd territory the Smart Ideas incentive might be two
parts, one for converting lamp and ballasts to more efficient models, and a
separate incentive for permanent removal of a lamp through addition of a
reflector.  They use the word ?replace? in the description, even though
someone else had replied to your post with an alternate definition.



Other utility programs may or may not also incentivize new lamps, or it may
be included in the initial ballast and fixture upgrade.



The answer I think could vary depending on which utility program you are
using.

Hi all,



I am looking for incentive rates from electricity supply companies in terms
of lighting retrofits. So, when I am opting for an option of changing 3-lamp
T12 magnetic ballast lighting fixture to 2-lamp super T8 electronic ballast
fixture, will this be considered under lighting retrofit or replacement?



Also, will the incentive include delamping rebate also?



Thanks in advance.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Call for papers for special issue from Journal of
	Building Performance Simulation
Message-ID: <CF5331C45914F242BA4E021761FA02EF097A04CD@UKEXBE01.UK.CorpLAN.net>

CALL FOR PAPERS FOR A SPECIAL ISSUE OF THE 

Journal of Building Performance Simulation 

 

OLYMPIC VENUES AND INFRASTRUCTURE 

 

Guest editors: Pieter de Wilde, Dejan Mumovic and Malcolm Cook 

 

The publisher of the Journal of Building Performance Simulation, Taylor
& Francis, together with Routledge, intend to produce a collection of
special issues of journals that deal with the Olympic and Paralympic
Games of London 2012. Olympic and Paralympic Games generate substantial
construction projects in the host country, involving the development of
flagship stadia, athlete and press accommodation, and many other
spin-off projects. These projects will have worldwide attention during
the games. It is therefore crucial for the host nation to ensure they
are high performance, state-of-the-art facilities. 

 

This Special Issue of the Journal of Building Performance Simulation
invites contributions which address the building performance of Olympic
Venues - especially those for London 2012 - across the different
building simulation domains: thermal behaviour (energy and comfort),
ventilation and air flow, lighting, fire and evacuation, acoustics, and
integrated views that combine these domains. Papers are welcome that
address different levels of spatial resolution, covering Olympic
buildings and their components, Olympic sites, but also the urban level
beyond these sites. Contributions may cover different levels of
innovation, starting from regular engineering application (fitness for
purpose checks) to more innovative studies that deal with topics such as
urban development and planning, climate change, sustainability and reuse
of facilities after the end of the games. 

 

Submissions: authors are asked to submit a 300-500 word abstract
describing the focus, research, results and conclusions of the paper
they propose to submit. Abstracts and further enquiries should be
emailed to Dr Pieter de Wilde, pieter.dewilde at plymouth.ac.uk by 12
November 2010. Full papers are due 20 May 2011 via Manuscript Central at
http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/tbps.

Cheney, can you post the chapter in the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals where
I can find the equation

Hi Deepa, 

 

My two cents. 

 

For your question, you need to know: 

 

1. the air volume in room and its pressure

 

2. To achieve 5Pa, how much more air should be introduced - 

 

Higher pressure x air volume in room/atmospheric pressure 

 

Now you get the number for the  static condition... ;)

 

to maintain the pressure in a leaky room you have to pump in more air, right?


 

3. from the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals:

Q = 2610 x A x (DP)1/2

* Q is the room leakage flow rate in cfm,
* 2610 is a conversion factor,
* A is the net open crack area of the room (generally not measurable), and
* DP is the differential pressure.

4. If you'd like to maintain certain pressure in the room, you need to supply
2+3 first. When the pressure is established in dynamic condition, you need to
supply only 3 to maintain the pressure you want. 

 

This is only the theoretical calculation for your reference. 

Cheers, 
Cheney

Hi Johannes,

I am sorry for my typo error. The equation can be found in ASHRAE Handbook
- HVAC Applications. My version is 2003, page 52.5. It is actually under
Fire an Smoke Management.

Message-ID: <769F37AB357BF741BC9FD2057F2618320F6B7736@ex-be03.burohappold.com>

How can daylight factors be calculated for a grid of points in an
EnergyPlus zone with external shading?

 

DELight allows up to 100 reference points to be defined, however this
does not appear to take into account any shading (Shading:Building,
Shading:Overhang, Shading:Zone etc).

The DELight input file _DELight.in contains a reference to BUILDING
SHADES, however I can't find an EnergyPlus configuration that gives
anything other than "N_BShades 0".

 

Thanks,

All:

Question on Cool Roof and the way to simulate them in eQuest.



My boss came to me with a cool roof and asked me to do a quick eQuest on it. I 
did a 25,000 sf single story office in Los Angeles, saw the roof outside 
emissivity was 0.9. ?I changed it to 0.5 and the electric usage went UP. I 
change it again to 0.12 and the electric usage went up AGAIN. The HVAC is a 
standard single zone pacakge unit with furnace heat.

Am I seeing reality or what am I missing?

Thanks.

John,
 
Nay. I believe you should be leaving the emissivity alone (or changing
it only slightly). By decreasing the emissivity, you make it more
difficult for the roof to get rid of heat that is absorbed. White/cool
roofs have higher reflectance. You want to change the absorptance (= 1 -
reflectance) of the roof, which is entered in the roof construction in
eQUEST. See my previous email, attached, for more info.
 
Regards,
Bill

Question on Cool Roof and the way to simulate them in eQuest.
 
My boss came to me with a cool roof and asked me to do a quick eQuest on
it. I did a 25,000 sf single story office in Los Angeles, saw the roof
outside emissivity was 0.9.  I changed it to 0.5 and the electric usage
went UP. I change it again to 0.12 and the electric usage went up AGAIN.
The HVAC is a standard single zone pacakge unit with furnace heat.
 
Am I seeing reality or what am I missing?

In response to the question from Ralph Evins regarding DELight accounting
for external shading:

No DElight does not account for external shading.  I was surprised by this
myself, but checked the code to make sure.  Although DElight is capable of
accounting for shading surfaces, none of the EnergyPlus Shading Surface
types are currently transferred to DElight for its calculations.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Daylight factors in EnergyPlus: Does DELight account for

How can daylight factors be calculated for a grid of points in an EnergyPlus
zone with external shading?



DELight allows up to 100 reference points to be defined, however this does
not appear to take into account any shading (Shading:Building,
Shading:Overhang, Shading:Zone etc).

The DELight input file _DELight.in contains a reference to BUILDING SHADES,
however I can?t find an EnergyPlus configuration that gives anything other
than "N_BShades 0".



Thanks,

DOE, PNNL Release Report on Cutting Energy Use in Half in Commercial Buildings
October 08, 2010
Report details strategies to save energy in quick-service restaurants
The U.S. Department of Energy and its Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) have released a technical report that provides recommendations on how to achieve up to 50% energy savings in quick-service restaurants. PNNL, with help from industry collaborators and under the direction of DOE's Building Technologies Program, performed the research, analysis, and documentation that support DOE's goal of significantly improving the energy efficiency of new and existing commercial buildings across the United States.
Technical Support Document: 50% Energy Savings for Quick-Service Restaurants[cid:image001.gif at 01CB6943.3F5CE910]<http://www.pnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-19809.pdf> details a package of energy-efficiency measures that cut energy use in quick-service restaurants by up to 50% compared to a baseline standard in less than five years. The 50% goal involves reducing site energy usage in all eight U.S. climate zones, relative to buildings constructed to meet minimal code-compliant requirements of ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-2004.
For the analysis, PNNL developed a 2,500-square-foot building model that was based on actual floor plans in prototypical quick-service restaurant design. PNNL used EnergyPlus, an energy simulation program, to determine the energy savings provided by the energy-efficiency measures. The prototype building was analyzed in the eight U.S. climate zones, which were further divided into 16 representative climate cities. The report establishes the baseline energy use by end-use category in a typical quick-service restaurant and provides the site energy and energy cost savings from implementation of the recommended measures. The report also provides an estimate of the incremental first costs and simple payback years for an energy-efficient quick-service restaurant in various climate locations.
The following energy-efficiency measures helped researchers reach the energy-savings target:

 *   Ultra-efficient cooking appliances resulted in reduced kitchen exhaust air flow
 *   An optimized HVAC system configuration was used to better utilize a dedicated outdoor air system and runaround coil loop heat recovery
 *   Efficient exterior and interior lighting were used around the building and dimming controls were used in the dining room
 *   Enhanced insulation, cool roofs, and high-performance window glazing improved the building envelope.
The 50% savings report will provide the basis for the next series of Advanced Energy Design Guides (AEDGs), which are "how-to" guides that show architects, engineers, and building designers how to achieve above-code exemplary energy performance for buildings using existing technologies available today. The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) works in collaboration with DOE, the American Institute of Architects, the Illuminating Engineering Society, and the U.S. Green Building Council to develop and publish AEDGs. These are available for free public download<http://www.ashrae.org/technology/page/938>.
In addition to the ASHRAE design guides, the results of these studies will be shared with DOE's Commercial Building Energy Alliances and the Commercial Building Partnerships. These groups are public-private collaborations aimed at developing energy-efficient technologies and practices and sharing the information with commercial building owners and operators around the United States.
DOE, with its national laboratories, commissions these technical support documents (TSDs), to describe the assumptions, methodologies, and analyses used to achieve certain levels of energy performance. DOE has published documents in several categories for commercial buildings. To view previous TSDs, search the publications database<http://nrelpubs.nrel.gov/Webtop/ws/nich/www/public/SearchForm>.
The mission of the Building Technologies Program (BTP) is to develop technologies, techniques, and tools for making buildings more energy efficient, productive, and affordable. BTP focuses on improving commercial and residential building components, energy modeling tools, building energy codes, and appliance standards. For more information, visit the Building Technologies Program Web site<http://www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/>.

Hello -

 

I forwarded this email to colleagues working in LBNL's Cool Roof group
(Jonathan Slack (JLSlack at lbl.gov) and Haley Gilbert (hegilbert at lbl.gov )),
and got this response back from them:

 

***

 

"By reducing the emissivity, he's reducing the ability of the roofing
material to emit thermal IR and thereby drop it's temperature. Hence, the
roofing material is increasing in temperature, thus increasing heat flow
into the structure, thus increasing demand on the cooling system. The most
effective cool roofs are both high in reflectivity and high in thermal
emittance. Haley and I have all sort of nice graphics on this if your
collaborator would be interested in seeing them.

Bottom line for his model - increase reflectance, increase emissivity.
Luckily, all the real world cool roof materials actually do have high
emissivities. An example of a poor cool roof material would be polished
copper - even though it's reflectance is high, it's low emissivity dooms it
to poor performance in a hot climate."

Cool roof would have high thermal emittance and low solar absorptance (high solar reflectance). So you need to modify the parameters accordingly.

John,
Appendix G may or may not be a meaningful reference for  your boss but here goes.
In 90.1-2007, Table G3.1 allows roofs with reflectance greater 0.70 or more and remittance greater than 0.75 (per testing standards) to be modeled as having a reflectance of 0.45.  I presume the difference there is initial vs. maintained.  Baseline and other roofs are to be modeled with a reflectance of 0.30.

In eQUEST/DOE-2, absorptance is a Construction property while emissivity is a Surface property.
As Bill noted absorptance = 1 - reflectance, assuming no transmission (opaque surface).
The help section also has values for different properties.

External shading by buildings, PV panels, etc should also be considered.

USGBC launches ADVANCED ENERGY MODELING FOR LEED, 

 

Technical Manual.

 

USGBC has developed the Advanced Energy Modeling for LEED, Technical
Manual to guide the project teams and LEED reviewers on requirements and
documentation for Whole Building Energy Simulation to Optimize Energy
Performance of the building. The objective is to provide further
information on EA Credit 1, streamline the LEED documentation process,
and provide a greater degree of consistency for both LEED applications
and reviewer comments. This manual should be considered a guiding
document on EA Credit 1 requirements. The intended users of this manual
are both LEED reviewers and applicants with intermediate or advanced
understanding of energy modeling, referenced standards, and energy
codes. This edition is primarily applicable to LEED for New Construction
& Major Renovations v2.2,LEED Core & Shell v2.0 and LEED for Schools and
can be adapted to apply to LEED Building Design and Construction 2009.
The Manual includes chapters containing overview of references
standards, key simulation outputs, submittal and documentation
checklist, summary of applicable CIRs, verification of proposed savings,
simulation input-output consistency, sample exceptional calculation
methodologies accepted by USGBC including natural ventilation and many
others. A book preview
<http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=7795>  is available.
Please visit USGBC website

Hello Mary,
I purchased it and think that it will be very useful for those who submit EAc1 and find that the GBCI responds with a lot of clarification requests. There is a good list of common mistakes in submission documentation that I found extremely useful. What is a bit less useful about the document is that it is not updated for ASHRAE 90.1-2007 nor does it take into account the new DES modeling requirements.

DOE, NREL Release Reports on Cutting Energy Use in Half in Commercial Buildings
September 24, 2010

Reports detail strategies to save energy in large office buildings and large hospitals

The U.S. Department of Energy and its National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) have released two technical reports that provide recommendations on how to achieve 50% energy savings in large office buildings and large hospitals. Conducted by NREL's Commercial Buildings Group, under the direction of DOE's Building Technologies Program, the studies support DOE's goal of significantly improving the energy efficiency of new and existing commercial buildings across the United States.

Technical Support Document: Strategies for 50% Energy Savings in Large Office Buildings[cid:image001.gif at 01CB6A0A.088740D0]<http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy10osti/49213.pdf> evaluates the potential for new large office buildings to achieve a 50% net onsite energy savings compared to a baseline standard (as defined by ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-2004). The report found 50% energy savings can be achieved in both low-rise and high-rise office buildings in a broad range of U.S. climates. The analysis was conducted in 16 cities that represented different climate zones, such as hot and humid, hot and dry, marine, cold and humid, and cold and dry. The following energy-efficiency measures helped researchers reach the 50% energy-savings target:
*         Lighting power density was reduced in office spaces and occupancy sensors were used in infrequently occupied spaces.
*         High-efficiency boilers, chillers, air distribution units, and service water heating equipment were installed.
*         Plug loads were reduced by purchasing high-efficiency electronic equipment and using special controls that shut off equipment when not in use.

Large Hospital 50% Energy Savings: Technical Support Document[cid:image001.gif at 01CB6A0A.088740D0]<http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy10osti/47867.pdf> details the technical analysis performed and the resulting design guidance that will enable large hospitals to achieve whole-building energy savings of at least 50% over the above standard. The large hospitals report also documents the modeling methods used to demonstrate how the design recommendations will help institutions meet or exceed the 50% energy-savings goal. This report found 50% energy savings can be achieved in large hospitals across all eight U.S. climate zones. Energy savings range from 50.6% to 61.3%, with the smallest savings in humid climates and extremely cold climates. The highest energy savings were achieved in marine climates, with relatively high energy savings achieved in dry climates. In general, for each climate type (humid, marine, and arid), savings were seen to decrease as the climate became progressively colder.

DOE commissions these types of technical reports, called technical support documents (TSDs), to describe the assumptions, methodologies, and analyses used to achieve certain levels of energy performance.  In many cases, technical support documents are the basis for Advanced Energy Design Guides (AEDGs), which are "how-to" guides that show architects, engineers, and building designers how to achieve above-code exemplary energy performance for buildings using existing technologies available today. The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) works in collaboration with DOE, the American Institute of Architects, the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America, and the U.S. Green Building Council to develop and publish AEDGs.

In addition to the ASHRAE design guides, the results of these studies will be shared with DOE's Commercial Building Energy Alliances. These alliances are public-private collaborations aimed at developing energy-efficient technologies and practices and sharing the information with commercial building owners and operators around the United States.

DOE, PNNL Release Report on Cutting Energy Use in Half in Commercial Buildings
October 08, 2010
Report details strategies to save energy in quick-service restaurants
The U.S. Department of Energy and its Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) have released a technical report that provides recommendations on how to achieve up to 50% energy savings in quick-service restaurants. PNNL, with help from industry collaborators and under the direction of DOE's Building Technologies Program, performed the research, analysis, and documentation that support DOE's goal of significantly improving the energy efficiency of new and existing commercial buildings across the United States.
Technical Support Document: 50% Energy Savings for Quick-Service Restaurants[cid:image001.gif at 01CB6A0A.088740D0]<http://www.pnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-19809.pdf> details a package of energy-efficiency measures that cut energy use in quick-service restaurants by up to 50% compared to a baseline standard in less than five years. The 50% goal involves reducing site energy usage in all eight U.S. climate zones, relative to buildings constructed to meet minimal code-compliant requirements of ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-2004.
For the analysis, PNNL developed a 2,500-square-foot building model that was based on actual floor plans in prototypical quick-service restaurant design. PNNL used EnergyPlus, an energy simulation program, to determine the energy savings provided by the energy-efficiency measures. The prototype building was analyzed in the eight U.S. climate zones, which were further divided into 16 representative climate cities. The report establishes the baseline energy use by end-use category in a typical quick-service restaurant and provides the site energy and energy cost savings from implementation of the recommended measures. The report also provides an estimate of the incremental first costs and simple payback years for an energy-efficient quick-service restaurant in various climate locations.
The following energy-efficiency measures helped researchers reach the energy-savings target:

 *   Ultra-efficient cooking appliances resulted in reduced kitchen exhaust air flow
 *   An optimized HVAC system configuration was used to better utilize a dedicated outdoor air system and runaround coil loop heat recovery
 *   Efficient exterior and interior lighting were used around the building and dimming controls were used in the dining room
 *   Enhanced insulation, cool roofs, and high-performance window glazing improved the building envelope.
The 50% savings report will provide the basis for the next series of Advanced Energy Design Guides (AEDGs), which are "how-to" guides that show architects, engineers, and building designers how to achieve above-code exemplary energy performance for buildings using existing technologies available today. The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) works in collaboration with DOE, the American Institute of Architects, the Illuminating Engineering Society, and the U.S. Green Building Council to develop and publish AEDGs. These are available for free public download<http://www.ashrae.org/technology/page/938>.
In addition to the ASHRAE design guides, the results of these studies will be shared with DOE's Commercial Building Energy Alliances and the Commercial Building Partnerships. These groups are public-private collaborations aimed at developing energy-efficient technologies and practices and sharing the information with commercial building owners and operators around the United States.
DOE, with its national laboratories, commissions these technical support documents (TSDs), to describe the assumptions, methodologies, and analyses used to achieve certain levels of energy performance. DOE has published documents in several categories for commercial buildings. To view previous TSDs, search the publications database<http://nrelpubs.nrel.gov/Webtop/ws/nich/www/public/SearchForm>.
The mission of the Building Technologies Program (BTP) is to develop technologies, techniques, and tools for making buildings more energy efficient, productive, and affordable. BTP focuses on improving commercial and residential building components, energy modeling tools, building energy codes, and appliance standards.

Otto,

Not that I would be an expert on the Washington State energy code, but I just happened to be looking at it on the web yesterday, and found it has only two climate zones, as follows:

ZONE 1:  Climate Zone 1 shall include all counties not included in Climate Zone 2.  
ZONE 2:  Climate Zone 2 shall include: Adams, Chelan, Douglas, Ferry, Grant, Kittitas, Lincoln, Okanogan, Pend Oreille, Spokane, Stevens, and Whitman counties.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Cooling Loads Question
Message-ID: <AANLkTim5XCbMFCFn_ir87Br3E5tExjeK72nXzw54q4QN@mail.gmail.com>

Good Evening Everyone:
I have a question about high cooling loads I am getting in my simulation.  I
have developed a simulation in Design Builder, using Energy+ as the
simulation engine.  It has been developed acording to ASHRAE 90.1-2007 AppG,
and it is for a leased space of 11,000+ SF.  Additionally, I specified
System #4 - PSZ-HP.
I double checked my weather file, equipment loads, and lighting loads, and
they are within range.  However, my cooling loads are almost 4 times as high
as my heating (Heating = 3.4 kbtu/sqft-yr & Cooling = 12.4 kbtu/sqft-yr).
My major concern with this is that when I use CBECS as a reference the
heating and cooling loads are almost reversed from what I am getting.
I have read over the Design Builder Users Manual to verify that I have not
overlooked anything, but I am at a loss...
My simulation may be correct, however I did want to get a second opinion.
Any information or suggestions is appreciated.

Thanks,

Corey,

Where is the building located and what is it's use? It's not too unusual to
have cooling loads that are much higher than heating loads as all the
internal gains go against you during the cooling season but assist you
during the heating season.

Corey, 

You may also want to look at your ground temperatures. DB uses a default 14C as monthly averages for the whole year. Ideally you would use E+ SLAB to calculate ground temperatures for your specific project. On larger buildings and depending on climate, lower ground temperatures normally increase the heating loads. However if one uses E+ recommended approximation Ti - 2C (for larger footprints), on a smaller footprint you do get those kinds of results. Otherwise, if you send me your DB file I may be able to help.

Corey, 

You may also want to look at your ground temperatures. DB uses a default 14C as monthly averages for the whole year.

Good Evening Everyone:
I have a question about high cooling loads I am getting in my simulation.  I have developed a simulation in Design Builder, using Energy+ as the simulation engine.  It has been developed acording to ASHRAE 90.1-2007 AppG, and it is for a leased space of 11,000+ SF.  Additionally, I specified System #4 - PSZ-HP.
I double checked my weather file, equipment loads, and lighting loads, and they are within range.  However, my cooling loads are almost 4 times as high as my heating (Heating = 3.4 kbtu/sqft-yr & Cooling = 12.4 kbtu/sqft-yr).
My major concern with this is that when I use CBECS as a reference the heating and cooling loads are almost reversed from what I am getting. 
I have read over the Design Builder Users Manual to verify that I have not overlooked anything, but I am at a loss...
My simulation may be correct, however I did want to get a second opinion.  Any information or suggestions is appreciated.

Not sure if this is the case for you (depends on which report you are
looking at) -
The CBECS would give electricity consumption for cooling and gas consumption
for heating (usually) - so if you factor in the COP of the cooling
equipment, your numbers will look more like what you are expecting. i.e if
COP is 4, the electrical consumption for cooling will be ~3 kbtu/sqft? This
will not reverse the numbers though.

I don't think it sounds unreasonable, then, as I know that Washington D.C.
is as hot as heck during the summer, I used to live there. It's cold during
the winter, too, but you get all the internal gains helping you. I can't
imagine that the ground temperature would make a significant difference.

I could give your files a quick look if you wanted or a more complete peer
review for a fee.

I am not a modeler, but I've worked a bit with the TRANE Trace demo
software a few years ago.

 

I've forgotten how to maneuver within it, so I was hoping someone might
comment on this question.

 

The software provided an air leakage rate for whatever wall assembly is
entered into the model.

 

I know from previous posts and responses that you do not change the air
leakage rate to account for any air barrier system that is to be
installed.  I also know that if you do apply an air barrier leakage
rate, the model is very sensitive to it, and the model produces
significant energy savings because of it.

 

And, it's my understanding the R-value rating of the insulation is used
despite that the rating is based on more or less zero air flow.

 

So, I'm wondering if the models, seeing both zero-air-flow insulation
and un-moderated leakage rates, ignore one or the other or somehow
produce a modulated result that reflects reduced wall assembly R-value
from air leakage through it.

Hi Paul,

Probably I did not really understand your question. But my understanding is
that R values of building assemblies will be mainly used for conductive
calculation while air leakage rate through assemblies will be involved in
convective one. In this case, there is no modulated result reflected the
combined effect of the two parameters. Instead, they are represented
respectively in the simulation results.

Cheers,
Cheney

Scenario:
I have an "intermediate" sized building (25,000 to 150,000 sqft) with
several systems in it.  can each system be determined separately or should
each by a System type 5/6 depending on Heating source?  I would like to
label some small systems as a type 3/4 and some as type 5/6 depending on the
area that is served by the system.

thanks for any opinions that people would like to share.

Hi Rob,

If the systems serve distinctly different uses that comprise more than
20,000 sf you are fine. Otherwise, I would use the predominant heat source.
It will be interesting to hear others opinions.

Exception a of G3.1.1 looks at your proposed systems and has the noted 20,000 sf criteria.
Exceptions b & c are tied to thermal zones and are not tied to your proposed system configuration.
The planned system boundaries alone are not sufficient to trigger a separate lookup in table G.3.1.1A.
Often the mapping of system to zones is different between proposed and baseline model.

Hi Rob,

If the systems serve distinctly different uses that comprise more than 20,000 sf you are fine. Otherwise, I would use the predominant heat source. It will be interesting to hear others opinions.

Scenario:
I have an "intermediate" sized building (25,000 to 150,000 sqft) with several systems in it.  can each system be determined separately or should each by a System type 5/6 depending on Heating source?  I would like to label some small systems as a type 3/4 and some as type 5/6 depending on the area that is served by the system.

thanks for any opinions that people would like to share.

All,

Does anyone have good data on soil for green roofs? I am trying to determine the minimum amount of insulation needed for a roof with soil on top. Maybe an R-value per inch would help? I appreciate any help I can get.

That entirely is a function of what type of growing media and moisture
content. Every seminar I have been in said it does add insulation value, but
you can't count on it due to the variable presented by moisture and soil mix
content.

Do you have a detailed syllabus and an intended audience that you can
share? Will this be specific to any particular simulation tools, or focused
on generic best practices?

Can anybody chime in on their experience with the workshop?

Just to clarify, the course could be useful in your preparations for the
BEMP exam, and will focus on useful procedures and techniques for energy
modeling for varying project scope.



The course would also be very useful for those practitioners that haven?t
met all of the prerequisites to sit for the BEMP exam, but want to expand
their skill set.

I attended this in San Francisco on Monday of this week. It was an excellent seminar. Great discussion of modeling fundamentals, informing the design and a review of the performance rating method. They also went through some useful tools for pre and post processing eQuest data.

I was also in attendance in San Francisco on Monday. I'm a relatively
new energy modeler (about 1.5 yrs experience) and found the seminar
incredibly informative. Here's a list of the learning objectives, taken
directly from the presentation:

 

*          Explain the IBPSA building energy modeling body of knowledge


*          Apply the ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2007 Performance Rating Method
in order to develop Baseline and Proposed Design energy models

*          Identify best practices for providing high quality and
consistent modeling services

*          Inform building design through energy modeling

*          Develop an effective business case for energy efficiency

*          Implement measurement and verification procedures that use
calibrated building energy simulation models to calculate savings

 

The seminar was focused on best practices and not a particular program,
though eQuest was prominently featured. As Andy mentioned, some of the
design tools that were presented are specific to eQuest.

I attended this in San Francisco on Monday of this week. It was an
excellent seminar. Great discussion of modeling fundamentals, informing
the design and a review of the performance rating method. They also went
through some useful tools for pre and post processing eQuest data.

Justin,

I took the class with Gail/Erik last Monday offered here in San Francisco. Thanks again Gail/Erik :)!
It was great class-refresher for the knowledge I have and also learned some new things-especially in regards to 90.1/LEED.

The class does not target specific software though references were made to E+, equest, IES, etc. It's focused on generic best practices/workarounds/modeling tips/etc..

Per IBPSA web it was intended for

Message-ID: <AANLkTikopwHRoD2xEvp9PadOzURJCNDk_KzoCcoHZMAR@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All!

I am doing energy model for EA 1.3 LEED 3.0 CI. My project takes 2 floors of
8 story building. I am trying to understand this credit, and I probably
think to hard and make everything to difficult.

The building is LEED certified already. Energy model was done by AHSRAE
90.1-2004. All floors have WSHP units that cool and heat spaces. Fresh air
is delivered by energy recovery rooftop unit. System includes 2 boilers,
pumps, and 2 closed circuit evaporative cooling towers.
I'm working in Trace program.
So my project has common ERU, heating and cooling plants with other floors.
The underfloor air distribution system and two heat pumps were added to in
my project + occupancy sensors.
Could you explain me please, how do I need to build my model.
1. Do I have to model the whole building or take the area within my project
?
2. I will have 3 alternatives as it is required in LEED CI EA1.3 . First is
my actual design, third is a model by AHSRAE 90.1 2007. I can't understand
what should include the second alternative ( baseline case step 6 ) in this
case if I take area only within my project. Does it have to be my actual
design before renovation?

Please, help me to understand and to get clear thoughts.

Thank you

With best wishes,
Genia

Hi to all

I am modeling a building in eQUEST
This building has a garage on the grind floor and the ceiling above is concrete the plenum bellow the concrete floor is heated with furnaces. Any ideas how this can be modeled in eQUESt. 

Thanks.

But my understanding is that R values of building assemblies will be mainly used for conductive calculation while air leakage rate through assemblies will be involved in convective one. In this case, there is no modulated result reflected the combined effect of the two parameters. Instead, they are represented respectively in the simulation results.

I have been tasked to run EnergyPro versus eQuest for a particular Client. This 
is, of course, DOE-2.1E. I am running a Water Source Heat Pump. And?I am trying 
to match utility bills.

And?I am under a deadline.

My problem is that I cannot get the supplimentary boiler to run in the winter 
(abet Southern California winter). Their example DOES show such supplimentary 
boiler usage in the same climate.

Any suggestions?

Hello Justin,
This course is independent of the ASHRAE BEMP Certification Exam, although the material taught in the course will overlap with some of the topics that may be tested in ASHRAE's BEMP Certification Exam.

The course focuses on best practices for building energy modeling, rather than providing training that would be specific to a particular simulation tool. The topics that are covered in the course and the intended audience are listed at http://www.ibpsa.us/workshops.shtml

Do you have a detailed syllabus and an intended audience that you can share? Will this be specific to any particular simulation tools, or focused on generic best practices?

Can anybody chime in on their experience with the workshop?

Deepika:

I've taught building energy simulation for more than 25 years to 100s of students, and I can say without reservation that this workshop is a great way to set your modeling career on the right path.

There are several reasons for this. First, it is simply the best thing of its kind out there that I'm aware of. It was developed by a very smart contractor and was critically reviewed by a smart group who have a combined experience of hundreds of years of simulation across multiple platforms, including EQUEST, EnergyPlus, and TRNSYS.

Second, you'll meet some really smart people that can be a future resource for you and your firm as you negotiate your way through the twists and turns of modeling the new high performance buildings -- a tall order for even the best modelers. Third, and finally it will firmly introduce you to the wonders of IBPSA and IBPSA USA, including the vast archive of information available for free on the IBPSA website. We even have a meeting every six months where you can continue to expand your horizons, usually on Saturday night at the ASHRAE meeting.

So, jump in...

Genia,

Use your proposed building model. Simply open it up and save it using
another file name and make your changes. Should be doable in TRACE although
I haven't used it for a number of years so not entirely sure.

Genia,
To your first question, 90.1-2007 Chapter 11 Table 11.3.1 No 2.b. requires the model to include all of the spaces served by the mechanical system(s) serving the project spaces.  We had a LEED reviewer require remodeling of an energy performance prerequisite model to address this, even though the outcome was obvious.  And that was even before they overhauled their review process. I strongly believe that they will require your energy model for LEED 2009 for CI (EAp2 or EAc1.3) include of all of the spaces that are served by the air, water, and refrigerant systems that serve your project spaces.  A huge part of mechanical system performance is part load performance and the rationale is that you cannot adequately evaluate that without modeling the whole system with the correct capacities and load profiles.

I don't understand your 2nd question.

Good luck,

Paul Riemer
Dunham

Hi All!

I am doing energy model for EA 1.3 LEED 3.0 CI. My project takes 2 floors of 8 story building. I am trying to understand this credit, and I probably think to hard and make everything to difficult.

The building is LEED certified already. Energy model was done by AHSRAE 90.1-2004. All floors have WSHP units that cool and heat spaces. Fresh air is delivered by energy recovery rooftop unit. System includes 2 boilers, pumps, and 2 closed circuit evaporative cooling towers.
I'm working in Trace program.
So my project has common ERU, heating and cooling plants with other floors. The underfloor air distribution system and two heat pumps were added to in my project + occupancy sensors.
Could you explain me please, how do I need to build my model.
1. Do I have to model the whole building or take the area within my project ?
2. I will have 3 alternatives as it is required in LEED CI EA1.3 . First is my actual design, third is a model by AHSRAE 90.1 2007. I can't understand what should include the second alternative ( baseline case step 6 ) in this case if I take area only within my project. Does it have to be my actual design before renovation?

Please, help me to understand and to get clear thoughts.

Thank you

Genia,
You'll have two models - and you will need to model everything that the
system serving your two floors is serving - which is probably the rest of
the building. If your two floors are served by an AHU, and that AHU serves
everything - you must model everything.

The first model will be your baseline model - LEED CI allows you to either
use your 90.1 ASHRAE baseline building as this baseline, OR if you are in a
really old really inefficient building, it allows you to model the existing
building as your baseline (before your retrofits / modifications). The
purpose of this is if you choose your location for your office well, say
you go into a LEED platinum building, your existing building is amazing -
and thus LEED CI allows you to use the 90.1 baseline for your base model.

The second model will be your proposed building. Try to get the energy
conservation measures incorporated  very early in the design.  LEED CI can
be difficult because your hands are often tied because of existing building
parameters...

My second LEED project (Our URS office in Southfield Michigan) was LEED CI,
it achieved Silver last year so I know CI modeling pretty well.. email me
if you have any questions.

you could refer to some research paper in the international journals, such as Energy and Buildings, Energy Policy. They are available online in the Elsevier database.
 
Your question is hard to determine, because the cooling/heating load index differ largely from climate zone to zone.
 
I also think the building energy saving standard in Korea may have the recommended values.

Hi All,
           In the ASHRAE-90.1-2004 it is menitioned that we have to
model chilled water pumps in baseline for 22W/gpm and hot water pumps
for  19W/gpm but there is no input in the software as W/gpm for the
pumps either we can enter gpm or watts seperatly  then how can we
incorporate this for baseline?

In Page 182 G3.1.3.3  it is mentioned that hot water supply and return
temperature shall be 180 ansd 130F is this for boilers or Domestic hot
water heating system?

If in our proposed case DHW is electric type than can we show some
energy consumption difference for baseline DHW in terms of some
efficiency, insulation or temperature parameters or not ,or only if
our DHW is solar type than only savings can be claimed from
baselineDHW?

In Page G3.1.3.10 it is mentiond that chilled water oumos serving less
than 300TR shall be be modelled as primary/secondary  system with
secondary pump riding the pump curve.I did'nt get what is meaning of
secondary pump riding the pump curve.

I shall be obliged if any one can give satisfactory answers to these
queries regarding ASHRAE.

Thanks
Sambhav.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] EnergyPlus V6.0 Released
Message-ID: <20101018225606.1911E4800D@diego.dreamhost.com>

EnergyPlus Version 6.0 Available

The latest release of the EnergyPlus building 
energy simulation program, Version 6.0, is now 
available in versions for Windows, Linux, and Mac 
operating systems. A few key new features 
include: significant speed increases -- up to 
25-40% execution time reduction in most 
simulations, life-cycle cost calculations, 
Transformer model, modeling of CO2 
concentrations, enhanced Green Roof (EcoRoof) 
model, enhanced convection coefficients.  We have 
updated and extended capabilities throughout the 
existing building envelope, daylighting, and HVAC 
equipment and systems portions of the program.

EnergyPlus V 6.0 is available at no cost from the 
EnergyPlus web site:  www.energyplus.gov.

OpenStudio plugin for Google SketchUp: The 
OpenStudio is a free plugin for the 
GoogleSketchUp 3D drawing program. The plugin 
makes it easy to create and edit the building 
geometry in your EnergyPlus input files. The 
plugin also allows you to launch EnergyPlus 
simulations and view the results without leaving SketchUp.

EnergyPlus Example File Generator: A Web-based 
service is available that creates and runs 
EnergyPlus input files for simple models of 
commercial buildings. The input files (and annual 
results summary files) are sent to your e-mail 
address as attachments. This is a pilot project 
and is currently made available only as a BETA 
service. You can access the service and customize 
the characteristics of the building you want to 
model on the EnergyPlus Example File Generator Application.

The set of example input files now includes 
full-blown models of typical new construction 
(drawn from the DOE Commercial Reference 
Buildings project). Also included is a real-life Hospital sample.

What's New in Version 6.0?

The highlights ? improved and new features ? are displayed by category.

Hi Deepak,

 

I think you mean single vs. two-speed DX compressors.

 

Having either two-speed compressors or multiple compressors for a given
DX coil means effectively you have two or more stages of cooling.
Staged cooling means you don't need to run the compressors full-out for
short periods when you only have a partial cooling load during the year.
As a result, they don't have to cycle on and off as much.  Cycling on
and off burns significantly more energy relative to the alternative of
staying on for an extended period - same way your car engine gets better
miles-per-gallon on the highway versus in the city with stop and go
traffic.  For this reason, staged cooling saves energy. 

 

Staged cooling has other benefits including tighter temperature control
and sometimes better de-humidification during part-load seasons,
depending on your system setup.

 

~Nick

Hi all,

I have a question about modeling skylights in e quest. 

I'm trying to customize the skylights in dd wizard mode. If I click the use
custom skylights and then edit custom skylights I'm facing with below
screen. I cannot see any created skylights at the below screen. 

I can customize the skylights when I have created a default building but in
my building something is wrong. If anybody can help me I will appreciated
!!!!! I have added pd2 and inp files as attachments.

Message-ID: <4F46B8EDBEE3424491F1CE6FBE6C33FE045B7F@eme-server-02>

Hi All,

I am currently modeling a building in DOE2.1e and am trying to comply with ASHRAE 90.1-2007 section G3.1.3.4 which states that:

Hot-water supply temperature shall be reset based on outdoor dry-bulb temperature using the following schedule: 180?F at 20?F and below, 150?F at 50?F and above, and ramped linearly between 180?F and 150?F at temperatures between 20?F and 50?F.

DOE2.2 allows you to model this in the "CIRCULATION-LOOP" command, but DOE2.1e does not recognize that code-word. Does anyone know how to incorporate hot-water temperature reset in DOE2.1e?

Thanks,

Sambhav,

For baseline pump energy, you can adjust the mechanical efficiency of
the pump without affecting the autosized flow rate. In eQUEST, I adjust
the mechanical efficiency (usually reducing it to 0.52 +/-) to get
22W/gpm or 19W/gpm, as indicated in the PV-A report for pump power and
flow.

Sections G3.1.3.2 through G3.1.3.5 are for space heating hot water
systems. Domestic hot water requirements are found in Table G3.1, No.11
Service Hot-Water Systems.

A centrifugal pump "rides the pump curve" when it is a single-speed pump
(no VFD) but the system has at least some two-way valves to permit
variable loop flow. So, for example, in eQUEST you would model a
secondary pump riding the pump curve by setting the secondary CHW loop
pump capacity control to "One Speed Pump" and making sure some or all of
the CHW coil valves are "Two Way".

Bill

I shall be obliged if any one can give satisfactory answers to these

Hello All,
Another solution to the 19 or 33 W/GPM is to adjust the pipe head in the circulation loop.  Just another way to do the same thing.

DOE2.1e from Hirsh uses the HW-SUPPLY-RESET = LOAD-RESET

"LOAD-RESET indicates that the HW-SUPPLY-T will 
be reset so that one hot-water coil valve is 
fully open.  All other hot-water coil valves will 
modulate as required to maintain the supply air temperature set-point."

Hello All,

I have a project with water loop heat pump system and district hot water as heating source. Different from regular configuration of boiler, I have trouble getting the district hot water loop into the water loop heat pump in DOE2.2. Does anyone have any idea how do I configure the loops?

Any suggestion is appreciated. Thank you,

David

Subject: [Bldg-sim] u factors with NFRC certification or u factors according
	to european norms
Message-ID: <!&!AAAAAAAAAAAYAAAAAAAAALC1D2GlsM5GjxojvO1WJG/CgAAAEAAAAKd3OQXIs7JAjQ+z1r9qKF4BAAAAAA==@erketasarim.com>

Just a small question. I have glazing with its frame which you can see as an
attachment. You can see the overall u factor ( glazing+frame) at the pdf
file. But as you can understand it has certified and calculated according to
the European norms. (The thermal transmission coefficients were figured for
insertion elements and windows (Uw) according to EN 10077-1:2006 and for
curtain wall (Ucw) in compliance with EN 13947:2006.) I mean our
fenestration with u factors, SHGC or visible light transmittance did not
determine, certify  and label in accordance with NFRC 100, 200, and 300. But
we have European norm certifications. In that case I will not allowed to use
the u factor value in the pdf ( which is 1,81 W/m2.K) for the NFRC u factor
value of the  building simulation software (e quest). ?? Is that correct? 

 

In this condition, do I have to use the figures mentioned in table A8.1A/B,
table A8.2 for the proposed design ?? It means my windows are not certified
or labeled and I will use worse u factors for the simulation but they are
produced according to the European norms and we can see these information
from the manufacturer specification. I have checked CIR section of the LEED
online and I have seen a similar problem happened for the Japan
norms.(fenestration has certified according to the Japan standards and LEED
accepted that case)

Comments ????

Hi Berke,

You can easily do this in DD edit mode. So, grit your teeth and exit the
wizard! After you do simply right click on the space that you want to add
the skylights to and fill in the blanks. You will be able to see right away
whether you located them properly.

Are there other problems you are having? At first glance the model looks
okay. You might want to have a peer review, however, it never hurts.

Eric,
Try this:
$ Create a schedule for OA reset
SD-01-RC  = DAY-RESET-SCH
SUPPLY-HI  = 180
SUPPLY-LO  = 150
OUTSIDE-HI = 50
OUTSIDE-LO = 20
..

SY-01-RC = RESET-SCHEDULE
THRU DEC 31
(ALL)  SD-01-RC
..

Then in your plant, look at your Hot Water supply reset and make the
change below.
HW-SUPPLY-RESET     = LOAD-RESET.

This should work

David,

It looks like you will have to make a boiler to approximate the district hot water loop.

Some suggestions:

1.       Make boiler efficiency equal to 1

2.       Remove any auxiliary equipment and start-up/shut-down time

3.       Assign a separate fuel meter to it with the associated district hot water cost per unit of energy (perhaps MMBTU, M=1,000) rate structure

This is similar to how you do this in TRACE as well, if anyone was wondering.

Message-ID: <2868B61B17A740409A18C906719BEBB8FF0EFC@EXC04COL1UK.uk.wspgroup.com>

Hi All,

 

I am working with energy plus in sketchup on the quest for one model.

 

What I am trying to do is to trace the external geometry from a 3d
daylighting model and to build my energy plus model and then apply
thicknesses internally afterwards to account for the volume accurately.

 

I know I can apply the floor to ceiling height in energy plus, but I am
struggling to find where I can apply the wall thickness without
individually changing each co-ordinate.

 

Does anyone know if it is possible to assign a wall thickness
specifically to go internally so ensure the internal volume will be
accurate if I trace external walls?

 

Thanks in advance.

 

Kind Regards

Ross,

So if I understand this correctly you are starting with a thick wall model used for 3d daylighting. Tracing the exterior geometry is the correct approach for EnergyPlus modeling. The heat transfer surfaces should be at the exterior face of the wall vs. the interior. You are correct that the volume EnergyPlus calculates will change based on where you draw that boundary. Drawing the heat transfer surface at the interior face of wall, while creating more accurate volumes, introduces bigger issues such as changing the surface area of the heat transfer surfaces exposed to the outside air and ground.

Just as you can set the ceiling height in EnergyPlus, you can also set the zone volume. So if you use tools in SketchUp to help get this volume, you can manually enter it in your IDF. You will have to use an IDF or text editor for this vs. the SketchUp Plugin. Note that if you do this the volume is not dynamic. If you change your zone geometry EnergyPlus will still use the volume you set earlier. There is a warning  when you run the simulation if the volumes differ drastically, but I'm not sure what that threshold is. Search for "field: volume" in the link below to learn more about the volume field.
http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/pdfs/inputoutputreference.pdf

So, now on to the tools to use in SketchUp to determine accurate interior volume. If you are using SketchUp 7 one option you have is to make a copy of your zone floors outside of the EnergyPlus group and then use the offset too. The offset tool icon looks like two arcs with a red arrow. Click once near the edge of the tool, and then click again where you want your offset path to be. You can also type a distance after the initial click. If you select your new face you can right click and choose "entity info" to view the area of your new face. Multiply that times the height to get your volume. If you plan to do this on a model that is still changing I would locate these floor copies  geometrically inside of the zone, but not physically in that group. You can also put the copies on a unique layer so that you can turn their visibility on and off. In SketchUp 8 you can use that same approach, or you can extrude the floor to a volume, and make it a group. Now you can right click to choose "entity info" and it will give you the volume of the group, assuming it is a clean manifold solid, airtight shape without extra surfaces or lines. Another option is to use a plugin called the "Joint Push Pull" plugin that among other things will perform a 3d offset. So if you have a 10 foot cube. You can offset all walls by 15 inches, and then get the volume of your new smaller cube (in SketchUp 8). Here is a link to the plugin, but you may have to register with the site to download the plugin and see the documentation.
http://forums.sketchucation.com/viewtopic.php?f=180&t=6708

Having shown you how you can use SketchUp to calculate the volume, and manually enter them into the IDF, I want to point out there are probably better places in the energy model for you to spend your effort rather than adjusting volumes. For example the effects of the internal mass in a zone would likely have a great impact on your energy analysis than minor adjustments to zone volumes.

I hope this helps, let me know if you have any additional questions.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Wall thickness

Hi All,

I am working with energy plus in sketchup on the quest for one model.

What I am trying to do is to trace the external geometry from a 3d daylighting model and to build my energy plus model and then apply thicknesses internally afterwards to account for the volume accurately.

I know I can apply the floor to ceiling height in energy plus, but I am struggling to find where I can apply the wall thickness without individually changing each co-ordinate.

Does anyone know if it is possible to assign a wall thickness specifically to go internally so ensure the internal volume will be accurate if I trace external walls?

Thanks in advance.

Kind Regards

	Research

Esteemed colleagues,

I'm throwing my hat in the ring for a NSF GRFP fellowship (as well as 
others fellowships). I have a few ideas for what I would like to research, 
but I wanted to vet them with the building simulation community. Any 
comments are appreciated. Epically comments regarding if you think 
research on the subject is needed or has broader application(s).

Some of my interests:
Applying solar thermal to northern climates (ie: my home town - Detroit)
Natural ventilation and optimizing building designs for airflow inside and 
through buildings.
Another key interest of mine is educating engineers and giving them easy 
to use tools for analyzing sustainable strategies. 

An aside - I wonder if I can apply for a fellowship to establish a 
workflow and document it in a users manual for engineers? I am a proponent 
of open-source software.. its free. Maybe document a workflow for CFD 
analysis using open-source or free CFD packages (NIST FDS, OpenFOAM etc) 
combined with open-source or free CAD packages (Blender)? 

Typically I'm full of ideas, but right now while filling out this 
application I cant decide on one...

Regards,
Shariq

Hello,

G3.1.2.5 states that?minimum ventilation rates will be the same for proposed

In my opinion:

For LEED, the OA should increase 30% first. This is the propose requirement.

Then for energy model, the baseline model should equal to proposed, which
means the baseline OA is also 30% more than 62.1 requirement.

I agree.  Standard 61.1 sets the minimum acceptable ventilation rate.
The design ventilation rate can be higher, and the baseline rate should
be the same as the real design.

Section G.3.1.2.5 in 90.1-2007 has added an exception to the "shall be the same" for models with demand controlled ventilation in the proposed that is not required by Section 6.4.3.9.

That alone is kind of confusing since it does not address what the values should be when they are allowed to not be the same.

I think they are trying to resolve the intersection of projects that use more OA than Std 62.1 and utilize demand controlled ventilation.
The most recent Trane Engineers broadcast promised more changes coming to this section (as addendum DA?) but I do not have anything published to reference.

In my opinion, the exception is means that keep the "design value" of OA
same in both proposed and basline, but use DCV only in proposed.

Because DCV can modify OA volume by the number of people in zone, and the OA
requirement is dynamics in simulation - which is too hard to keep baseline
same with, and also should not keep the same, if not where  does the saving
come from?

Baseline building should always be just providing the minimum outdoor air 
ventilation rate required by 62.1. It should never be increased. For proposed, 
it just means that your OA should never be below the minimum OA requirement of 
62.1. Now if the design chooses to pursue 30% more OA. Then you should reflect 
in your model what is in the design. G3.1.2.5 just wants to make sure that you 
do not model your proposed to be below the minimum OA. Providing 30% more OA can 
earn you a credit but it will affect your EAc1.

I agree with Jon.  The increased Ventilation rate of 130% OA is for comfort
only, and should show an increase in energy usage when compared to the
baseline.  this is the approach my firm has always took when solving this
little riddle.

There was a major discussion on this topic a few months ago, although it may
have been on the eQuest list-serve, I don't remember.  Try searching the
archives.

The general conclusion was that the current requirements are that the
baseline and proposed design models should have the same ventilation rates,
BUT that this doesn't make that much sense as you could over-ventilate to
the point where there is no added benefit to the occupants, and major
additional energy use.  The discussion was primarily around LEED EA Credit
1, and there was some correspondence between the simulation group and the
LEED credit chair.  I believe that they will be looking at modifying this
requirement for LEED models in the future.

This changes with the soon to be released 90.1-2010 which adds the following;

If the minimum outdoor air intake flow in the proposed
design is provided in excess of the amount required by the
rating authority or building official then the baseline
building design shall be modeled to reflect the greater of
that required by the rating authority or building official
and will be less than the proposed design.

In my opinion:

For LEED, the OA should increase 30% first. This is the propose requirement.

Then for energy model, the baseline model should equal to proposed, which means the baseline OA is also 30% more than 62.1 requirement.

For what it's worth, regardless of what the various publications
actually say, the last 5-6 projects of mine have had reviewers that had
me confirm that when I use DCV in the proposed design, that the baseline
design MUST match the minimum ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or 07) requirements.

 

So if you don't have DCV (shame on you!), then your baseline and
proposed models can have matching OA, and it can be whatever quantity
you want.

As soon as you incorporate DCV, the baseline model has to go down to
minimum 62.1 rates.

There was a major discussion on this topic a few months ago, although it
may have been on the eQuest list-serve, I don't remember.  Try searching
the archives.

 

The general conclusion was that the current requirements are that the
baseline and proposed design models should have the same ventilation
rates, BUT that this doesn't make that much sense as you could
over-ventilate to the point where there is no added benefit to the
occupants, and major additional energy use.  The discussion was
primarily around LEED EA Credit 1, and there was some correspondence
between the simulation group and the LEED credit chair.  I believe that
they will be looking at modifying this requirement for LEED models in
the future.

Because DCV can modify OA volume by the number of people in zone, and
the OA requirement is dynamics in simulation - which is too hard to keep
baseline same with, and also should not keep the same, if not where
does the saving come from?

That alone is kind of confusing since it does not address what the
values should be when they are allowed to not be the same. 

 

I think they are trying to resolve the intersection of projects that use
more OA than Std 62.1 and utilize demand controlled ventilation.

The most recent Trane Engineers broadcast promised more changes coming
to this section (as addendum DA?) but I do not have anything published

I agree.  Standard 61.1 sets the minimum acceptable ventilation rate.
The design ventilation rate can be higher, and the baseline rate should
be the same as the real design.

Then for energy model, the baseline model should equal to proposed,
which means the baseline OA is also 30% more than 62.1 requirement.

The previous discussion also touched on the topic of requirements for LEED
models changing at the review stage (your reviewer indicating something that
is reflected NOWHERE in the documentation).  This really makes me mad!  It
requires extra time on our end because either:

1.  The reviewers are not properly educated as to the requirements
2.  The reviewers are making up requirements on their own
or,
3.  The reviewers are following guidelines provided to them by someone
(USGBC???) that has not been made available to the modeling professionals
who must abide by these rules.

yes!  Hear! Hear!

My experience with submitted LEED projects has been.
1. proposed and baseline use the same OA quantity
2. you can take credit for DCV in the proposed building; however, the  baseline 
building is also required to use DCV in the spaces that are  required to have it 
as prescribed in 90.1

The previous discussion also touched on the topic of requirements for LEED 
models changing at the review stage (your reviewer indicating something that is 
reflected NOWHERE in the documentation).  This really makes me mad!  It requires 
extra time on our end because either:


1.  The reviewers are not properly educated as to the requirements
2.  The reviewers are making up requirements on their own
or,
3.  The reviewers are following guidelines provided to them by someone 
(USGBC???) that has not been made available to the modeling professionals who 
must abide by these rules.

there are so many different opinions~

read the 90.1, and also 90.1 user manual and LEED requirement carefully~

Allow me to add my two cents...

My understanding and what my logic are telling me (whether they forgot to clearly specify it in the Standard or not) is that OA design values in the Baseline should never be:


1.       more than the design values in the Proposed; and

2.       more than the code-prescribed  values.

independently of DCV or this 30% over-ventilation.

My experience with submitted LEED projects has been.
1. proposed and baseline use the same OA quantity
2. you can take credit for DCV in the proposed building; however, the baseline building is also required to use DCV in the spaces that are required to have it as prescribed in 90.1

The previous discussion also touched on the topic of requirements for LEED models changing at the review stage (your reviewer indicating something that is reflected NOWHERE in the documentation).  This really makes me mad!  It requires extra time on our end because either:

1.  The reviewers are not properly educated as to the requirements
2.  The reviewers are making up requirements on their own

3.  The reviewers are following guidelines provided to them by someone (USGBC???) that has not been made available to the modeling professionals who must abide by these rules.

So if you don't have DCV (shame on you!), then your baseline and proposed models can have matching OA, and it can be whatever quantity you want.
As soon as you incorporate DCV, the baseline model has to go down to minimum 62.1 rates.

There was a major discussion on this topic a few months ago, although it may have been on the eQuest list-serve, I don't remember.  Try searching the archives.

The general conclusion was that the current requirements are that the baseline and proposed design models should have the same ventilation rates, BUT that this doesn't make that much sense as you could over-ventilate to the point where there is no added benefit to the occupants, and major additional energy use.  The discussion was primarily around LEED EA Credit 1, and there was some correspondence between the simulation group and the LEED credit chair.  I believe that they will be looking at modifying this requirement for LEED models in the future.

Because DCV can modify OA volume by the number of people in zone, and the OA requirement is dynamics in simulation - which is too hard to keep baseline same with, and also should not keep the same, if not where  does the saving come from?

In my opinion:

For LEED, the OA should increase 30% first. This is the propose requirement.

Then for energy model, the baseline model should equal to proposed, which means the baseline OA is also 30% more than 62.1 requirement.

Hello,

G3.1.2.5 states that minimum ventilation rates will be the same for proposed building and baseline building. Does it mean that if my building design OA rate is increased by 30%, my model will still be based on the minimum OA required by 62.1 and is still equal to the baseline building OA? Meaning my proposed building wont be penalized by supplying more OA?


Thanks in advance.

I think this idea that the baseline building design ventilation rate
should be equal to the minimum code required rate should be handled
cautiously by energy modelers. Implementing this requirement would
require modelers to do the following:
1.) determine which code(s) are applicable for the mechanical design
(local/state codes and ASHRAE Standard 62.1 for starters)
2.) calculate the minimum design ventilation rates for all zones, for
all applicable codes for the project, and determine the highest minimum
rates if the applicable codes differ
3.) compare the calculated rates to the ventilation rates in the
proposed design, for all zones
 
This is significant additional scope that is usually not required for an
energy model, including LEED models. This is the responsibility of the
mechanical designer. Unless I know that a project is pursuing LEED IEQc2
credit, or that a proposed mechanical design is using excessive
ventilation for some other reason, I will use the proposed design
ventilation rates in both the proposed and baseline models, which I have
been entering on a zone-by-zone basis to this point to meet my
interpretation of the G3.1.2.5 intent.

Allow me to add my two cents...
 
My understanding and what my logic are telling me (whether they forgot
to clearly specify it in the Standard or not) is that OA design values
in the Baseline should never be:
 
1.       more than the design values in the Proposed; and
2.       more than the code-prescribed  values.
 
independently of DCV or this 30% over-ventilation.

My experience with submitted LEED projects has been.
1. proposed and baseline use the same OA quantity
2. you can take credit for DCV in the proposed building; however, the
baseline building is also required to use DCV in the spaces that are
required to have it as prescribed in 90.1

The previous discussion also touched on the topic of requirements for
LEED models changing at the review stage (your reviewer indicating
something that is reflected NOWHERE in the documentation).  This really
makes me mad!  It requires extra time on our end because either:
 
1.  The reviewers are not properly educated as to the requirements
2.  The reviewers are making up requirements on their own
or,
3.  The reviewers are following guidelines provided to them by someone
(USGBC???) that has not been made available to the modeling
professionals who must abide by these rules.

For what it's worth, regardless of what the various publications

So if you don't have DCV (shame on you!), then your baseline and
proposed models can have matching OA, and it can be whatever quantity
you want.
As soon as you incorporate DCV, the baseline model has to go down to
minimum 62.1 rates.

There was a major discussion on this topic a few months ago, although it
may have been on the eQuest list-serve, I don't remember.  Try searching
the archives.
 
The general conclusion was that the current requirements are that the
baseline and proposed design models should have the same ventilation
rates, BUT that this doesn't make that much sense as you could
over-ventilate to the point where there is no added benefit to the
occupants, and major additional energy use.  The discussion was
primarily around LEED EA Credit 1, and there was some correspondence
between the simulation group and the LEED credit chair.  I believe that
they will be looking at modifying this requirement for LEED models in
the future.

Message-ID: <BD137BAC95216647AF596B224864EA423FDE5E@bnaexch.SSR.com>

There are several CIRs to USGBC addressing humidification for process purposes, but I find a lack of information on modeling humidity for occupant comfort.  ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G at least states that humidity control setpoints should be the same in the baseline and proposed, but what fuel source to use in the baseline?  And what efficiency should be assigned to the humidification process?

 

Should the baseline humidification system be based on the Baseline HVAC system type?  This might work if the heating fuel source was electricity, as electric steam generators could be modeled.  But I?m not sure how gas-fired hot water boilers can be used for humidification?

 

Any help would be appreciated.

Since there's a lack of direction, I'd model what you actually have in both
the baseline and proposed models. It seems like you couldn't go wrong doing
it that way.

I have been wondering about this too, currently we have been primarily using EE4 which is a DOE 2.1 based program . The modeling Guide recommends specifying the space as HEAVYWEIGHT. I suspect this could be the wrong approach as I suspect any radiant gains falling on the floor becoming a plant load quicker than for an air based system.

Option of course would be to use Custom weighting factors but not sure if there are any guidelines for radiant slabs
