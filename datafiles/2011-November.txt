Hello everyone.

I am doing a research on Housing with the concept of 
 
Environmental friendly issues such as:
ecological / zero-energy/ recycled or re-used material constructions
  
Is there any website or magazine that I can find case studies.
I am looking for the one which are already constructed, plus I need the 
pictures and drawings of these case studies.
Thanks a lot in advance

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LBNL releases version 1.0 of the Modelica "Buildings"
 library and the Python "BuildingsPy" package to automate Modelica
 simulations
Message-ID: <CACXXVcjcW5Z4s+K=b0E+KqxvSDEDnUNjRMxwR=x+E7OUO-pp3Q@mail.gmail.com>

LBNL releases version 1.0 of the Modelica "Buildings" library and the
Python "BuildingsPy" package to automate Modelica simulations.

The Modelica "Buildings" library is a free open-source library with dynamic
simulation models for building energy and control systems. The library
contains models for
 * air-based HVAC systems,
 * water-based heating systems,
 * controls,
 * heat transfer among rooms and the outside, and
 * multizone airflow, including natural ventilation and contaminant
transport.

The primary use of the library is for flexible and fast modeling of
building energy and control systems to accelerate innovation leading to
cost-effective very low energy systems for new and existing buildings. The
library is particularly suited for
 * rapid prototyping of new building systems,
 * analysis of the operation of existing building systems,
 * development, specification, verification and deployment of building
controls within a model-based design process, and
 * reuse of models during operation for functional testing, for
verification of control sequences, for energy-minimizing controls, fault
detection and diagnostics.

All development is open-source and we welcome contributions.

For more information, visit http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica/

Together with the Modelica library, we also released "BuildingsPy," a
Python package that can be used
 * to run Modelica simulations using Dymola,
 * to process output files that were generated by Dymola or OpenModelica,
and
 * to run unit tests as part of the library development.

Message-ID: <005401cc9d65$0e60bba0$2b2232e0$@buildingperformanceteam.com>

Dear Forum,

I am soliciting input from you regarding your experience in using full, 8760
hour energy models for energy audits of existing buildings.  I have used
EnergyPlus for a few of these and am starting to get an opinion about what
is important for an existing building energy model.  I am convinced that the
rules  are different than for a new building, but would like to know what
your experience has been.

My primary interest is the "big picture" factors, not so much the fine
details. I have made an outline of factors and considerations below and will
appreciate your feedback and comments as you are able!

p.s., I suspect that I am not the first to ask this question!  If you are
aware of past conferences or papers, please point me in the right direction.

Energy Audits Which Utilize an Energy Model

Factors which imply the need for an energy model

.             Multi-use (different schedules for portions of the building)

.             Radically different construction types in different portions
of the building

  o           e.g., lightweight construction added to massive construction,
high % glazing added to low % glazing

.             Multiple air handlers of different types

  o           E.g., RTUs for one portion, baseboard heating only for another
portion

.             Anticipation of changing to one of the above

.             Other???

What is the minimum data needed for a defensible / reliable energy model?

.             Correct total wall area plus window area by elevation?

  o           With low regard for a perfect match to actual geometry

.             Schedules of operation?

.             Motor power for fans, pumps?

.             Air and water flow for fans and pumps?

.             Special uses?

  o           Pool

  o           Assembly

  o           Specialized equipment such as servers, X-ray

.             Plug loads?

.             Outdoor air flow?

.             Lighting loads in W/sq.f.t?  W / zone or room?

.             Exterior lighting?

.             Temperature / humidity setpoints?

.             Air handler control setpoints?

  o           Which ones?

.             Shading elements?

What method should be used for evaluating hard-to-measure data such as
actual lighting and plug load use, outdoor air flow, heating / cooling
system efficiency at part loads, infiltration, insulation (especially for
old buildings with no construction drawings), process power

.             Trial & error? Using user-imposed restraints?

.             Benchmark or past project data?

.             ???

How closely must the energy model match past energy use?

.             Match annual consumption +-10%?  >75% R2 month-by-month?

.             Is actual weather data important? (vs. TMY / "typical")

.             ???

How carefully must the energy model match define ECMs?

.             Annual? Peak? Efficiency of new components

.             Generic or manufacturer-specific performance data?

 

Description: BPT BizCard JVDII Updated

 

Tolerance is not agreement.  Tolerance is precisely the willingness to
restrain from the use of coercion. (and who hasn't experienced the benefit
of respectful, constructive disagreement?)

Dear colleagues,


I?ve heard that EnergyPlus v6 may have a bug to simulate horizontal shading
devices. Indeed, I was trying to simulate the impact of a shading device
using DesignBuilder and I noticed some critical inconsistencies in the
results.


I'd appreciate a lot if you could give me more information about the
magnitude and character of this calculation bug. I need to know more about
the limitations in the calculation so I can justify or not these
simulations in my PhD thesis.


Best regards,

Raoni Venancio

Dear Building Simulation 2011 attendee (or Sydney resident),


DIVA is a Radiance/Daysim/EnergyPlus plug-in that we have developed for the Rhinoceros/Grasshopper - NURBS modeler for Windows. DIVA supports a series of performance evaluations including:



- Physically-based scene visualizations (Radiance)

- Annual radiation maps (Radiance/GenCumulativeSky)

- Climate-based daylighting metrics (Daysim)

- Glare analysis (Evalglare)

- LEED IEQ Credit 8.1 compliance (Radiance)

- Hourly load calculations (EnergyPlus)



The plug-in offers highly optimized simulation workflows within Rhino and can be combined with parametric Grasshopper scripting in order to generate animated simulation movies (see for example http://vimeo.com/31269386).

Subject: [Bldg-sim] water-econo condenser flow
Message-ID: <22CE8791E7DE554FB00676D7248C6B55573480C3@AKFMAILPA.AKF-ENG.COM>


Anyone understand how condenser flow gets assigned for the FREE-COOLING chiller type?

Is the operating head of the FREECOOLING chiller over-ridden to force the flow rate and delta-T to match the chilled flow rate and delta T?

My building has 3200 gpm condenser water pumps with 10 deg F delta T, approx. 1200 tons rejection during normal operation. (2000 gpm chilled water pumps at 15 deg F delta T.)

One of these CW pump is used to provide water for free cooling via a shell-and-tube HX at a reduced delta T (6.25) at the same rough gpm (3200). The chiller is smaller than the main building chillers. (800 tons - chilled water side is designed for lower delta T 10 deg F at same flow rate 200 gpm in this case.)

However, no matter my inputs, the hourly flow on the condenser side is 2000 gpm, which exactly matches the flow rate and delta T of the chilled water side.

I would expect my specified constant-speed pump to operate at the operating point given by the component pressure drops to yield the design flow rate. However, the head on the condenser side appears over-ridden high to decrease flow to match the chiller side.

Any experience or ideas here?

Thanks,

I know the water-econo chiller type is relatively new.

Has anyone seen any documentation on its function beyond what's in context help / Topics / New Features manuals?

I'm having a hard time understanding the relationship between what I enter for flows / heads in the input file and what I am seeing in hourly reports.

Any references would be appreciated!

Is it good modeling practice to model a small chase in a building if it is

I vote "Ignore it".  It's a small construction difference in a small portion
of the overall envelope and will not affect your overall results at all,
especially considering the myriad of other assumption you are making.

Agreed.

 

Tracing the footprint as you have - you are setting up flexibility to
revisit this decision later if you should desire to.  You could easily
come back and define an alternate layered construction to apply to the
associated exterior surfaces later if you need to enhance the model's
accuracy ;).  I also suspect the net effect is probably negligible.

Dear Rob,

To me the idea of modeling these spaces as extra zones is a bit overkill, especially looking at their floor area in comparison to the adjacent room. The "detailed" approach you discussed would probably work, but probably doesn't gain you much in accuracy. It is difficult to tell from the drawings provided what the construction of these chases might be, but since they are so thin relative to the room, you might be able to approximate them by creating a special envelope construction with an air gap. You don't need to have a temperature node in your model for the chase, just capture their basic heat conduction properties.

Good luck!
Peter

Dear All,

According to 62.1-2004 we have to consider an exhaust rate of 0,75 cfm/ft2 (or 3,7 l/s m2) for parking garages.
To do the calculations I have a couple of questions:

1. Do we have to include the streets within the parking lot on the area calculation or only the parking area (where the cars actually park)?
2. In projects seeking LEED NCv3 IEQc2 "Increased ventilation". Do we have to consider a 30% increase on the parking exhaust rate or that only apply for ventilation rates?

Uh, what? Not sure what you are asking for here. You can calculate daylight factors in Radiance (for what they are worth), daylight coefficients, and all kinds of metrics. "Window cleanness" can be approximated by applying a factor the the transmissivity of the glazing, which is what Radiance expects as input. Glazing properties such as transmittance, reflectance, color and now even BSDFs can be derived from the Window6 program from LBNL.

Gut feeling is this shouldn't be a problem, provided you are actually
lighting the space with fixtures intended for that sole purpose.  

 

If you're trying to claim the area because it's sorta lit due to spill
from a roadway pole or entry wallpacks... I would expect resistance.  

 

Note 90.1 has a vaguer "special feature areas" category that may be a
better fitting description than "plaza."

Subject: [Equest-users] 90.1-2007 Exterior lighting - playgrounds

 

Question about exterior lighting power allowance for a  90.1-2007 LEED
baseline model with a playground area inside the LEED project boundary.
Would the playground qualify as a plaza area or special feature area
under 90.1-2007 Table 9.4.5?  Has anyone successfully submitted a
project for LEED review with a playground area classified under this
exterior lighting power allowance?

 

Thanks in advance,

Steven

Felipe,



1.       ASHRAE 62.1-2004 Table 6.4 (Minimum Exhaust Rates) has a category
for ?parking garage,? not ?parking spaces? apply the area of the whole
enclosed parking lot, including drive aisle (but excluding enclosed spaces
of other use types, such as mech rooms, stairwells, etc.)



2.       IEQc2 is all about increasing the ?breathing zone outdoor air
ventilation rates,? which corresponds to the outdoor air requirements of
the VRP calculation and Table 6-1. Parking garages are not part of this
calculation, so you are not required to increase the exhaust rate by 30%.
In fact you may have noticed that section 6.2.8 doesn?t even require that
the air you exhaust from the garage be made up with fresh air, you can use
any combination of outdoor, recirculated and transfer air.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Underground Parking Garages Exhaust Rates



Dear All,



According to 62.1-2004 we have to consider an exhaust rate of 0,75 cfm/ft2
(or 3,7 l/s m2) for parking garages.

To do the calculations I have a couple of questions:



1. Do we have to include the streets within the parking lot on the area
calculation or only the parking area (where the cars actually park)?

2. In projects seeking LEED NCv3 IEQc2 "Increased ventilation". Do we have
to consider a 30% increase on the parking exhaust rate or that only apply
for ventilation rates?



Kind Regards,

 heater in equest ?
Message-ID: <DC3E4BF25FD22047828351C670688CDC034932C523@MESERVER.meengineering.local>

Hello everyone, I'm new to the industry and to Equest so all info is greatly appreciated. I'm running into two problems right now
First, I have to model a baseboard (with knob thermostat on the unit) that is being left on and is adding greatly to the hydro bill but EQUEST only lets me add baseboards to an HVAC system and run it with the same heating schedule. Is there any way to separate this two?

Second, I need to model a police station garage that has a radiant tube heater but I can't seem to find it in the "system type". What options do I have? I looked through all the detailed data mode but I couldn't find anything.


Thanks in advance!

Hi Sowgol,

just as Rob wrote, just use the physical properties in your geometry and
scene description.

Radiance's basic unit is - surprise - radiance [W/m2sr]. If you want to
derive photometric values from radiometric onces, you typically use a
luminous efficacy of 179 in Radiance. Or you rely on its analysis tools
doing the conversion for you such as pvalue, falsecolor.

If glazing is not clean, I would expect transmission through it to get
reduced plus extra scattering. It depends on you application whether
scattering is of importance (e.g. a really dirty glazing exposed to
direct sun may lead to glare). Reduced transmission may be accounted for
by using it in you glass material definition (probably you should know
the reduction, which would require measurements). Heavy scatter could(!)
lead to using a different material type instead. An example: reduced
transmission would make your window pane just appear darker when viewed.
Increased scatter e.g. due to a layer of dust particles would make it
appear brighter when viewed directly except sources directly visible,
which would appear darker. In other terms, the scatter would distribute
the bright spot of the source over a wider area. That would make it
appear to have a bright film over the entire pane, while a perfectly
clear glazing would be dark with the source directly seen appearing at
its full brightness.

The important thing to remember (always) is that there is no such thing
as a correction factor in Radiance. It is all about physical units. If
results appear to be wrong, do not multiply but find the source of error.

Cheers, Lars.

Hi Jim,
Here are my thoughts on the subject. That'll help me sort things out as
well.

I don't do an audit without a full year hour by hour simulation. Why?
Because we offer E Audits as a means to optimise a client's building and to
give all the details to the client in order for him to make a good
decision. BTW, we do small and large commercial and institutionnal bldg
simulations and have been using EnergyPlus for some time now.

I must say that the solutions we are proposing call for something flexible
like EnergyPlus. I was using other softwares before but I must admit that
there where times when there was little advantage of using simulation
because we had to do the savings calculations on the side using much
guessing or assumptions. Now I can make any system I like. Using bldg
exhaust air or outdoor air or a mix of the two to feed the garage
ventilation system would be easy and take out a lot of uncertainties.
I think that other softwares are fine if you just want to compare two
systemes performances in a real life bldg in a specific climate and with
specific uses. When I think of e-sim as a set of equipement (HVAC) for a
specific bldg (walls and windows, etc.) used in a specific way by the
occupants (schedules, plug loads, etc.) I realise that there is much more
interpretation and uncertainties in the latter anyway. So why bother with
hour by hour e-sim if you are not looking at what's happening every hour.
In optimisation however, I need to look at what's happening every hour.
While most other softwares are running 8760 hours most do not give you a
good visualisation of the results on that scale (i.e. hour by hour). I want
to be able to graph a pumps runtime with a room's exess heat, concurrent
cooling and heating loads, exhaust air of one room compared to the intake
of another... This is why I use hour by hour e-sim.

You mention that you are looking for the big picture. I agree but...I tend
to be carefull at not adding (and often multiplying) uncertainties.  you
know what I'm talking about. I think I change my strategy depending on the
type of building use or construction. I won't be looking too much at the
pumps if there are only a few. I might consider more the wall construction
of an older bldg, But bottom line, why bother with a pump's specifications
if you're not even sure of its runtime. What do you think?

Also, matching the bldg's energy bills helps me to validate some schedules
and HVAC operations mainly. I don't really want to be close to the bills
each time. 30% can be acceptable if you have some explanations. I look at
the patterns of real vs simulation data : monthly energy use distribution
by source and by end use, peak power demand monthly. I would like to use
benchmarking more but I didn't find much valuable information for canadian
bldgs yet.

Anyone has good BENCHMARKING data for canada? by end use mainly.
Energy Portfolio Manager (EPM) will now collaborate with Canada gov. I hope
that is good. I used it once and had a major issue with source energy since
the bldg was 100% electric. Electricity is 90+% hydro here in Montreal.

"How carefully must the energy model match define ECMs?"
I'd say how important are the results in making the right decision? also,
what does it take to have more precise information? It's a tradeoff between
the two.

Merci, Mssr. Beaulieu.

I agree about using an 8760 hour simulation.  The big issue is how to define
the level of importance for various inputs and how that affects you speed of
preparing the model. I think certain information can be assumed with
reasonable confidence, some must be measured and some can be figured out by
trial and error.

As you mention below, many owners / operators have no clue about the details
of their systems' operation, so you must attempt some trial and error to get
a good fit, or spend a lot of time in the building.  I like spending time in
buildings, but my clients are not too excited about paying me to do it, so
I'm looking for reasonable shortcuts.

As an aside, I think benchmarking is helpful if your building happens to fit
one of the standard categories.  It is NOT helpful to understand why the
building varies from the category mean.

I am now walking the path of a three step accuracy level for an energy
audit.  

1.       The first step is a "drive by" audit using basic building
dimensions, age and HVAC & lighting system information along with utility
bills.  (No utility bills = no confidence about predictions.)

2.       Step 2 is gathering more detailed information from occupants about
schedules and gathering data about key energy equipment ("gathering data"
means measuring motor power and key operating temperatures, and observing
outdoor air damper positions)

3.       Step 3 gather yet more detailed information when Step 2 results in
more than 10% difference between annual and predicted energy plus worse than
75% R-squared correlation month-by-month.

 

Step 1 can be considered a measure of opportunity for the owner and is
supposed to be very fast and inexpensive.  Step 2 confirms and quantifies
the opportunity, and includes a moderate amount of additional effort.  Step
3 is even more effort and more costly.

I think many owner / managers are hesitant to invest much money when they
are unconvinced that there is any sizable opportunity / savings.  Once it
looks promising, they are more likely to fund additional work.  More likely,
but not highly likely, so that step still needs to be a modest cost
increase.

The just-delivered ASHRAE Journal has an interesting article on
"Streamlining Energy Simulation To Identify Building Retrofits", which is
very timely for me J. The authors did a fairly detailed audit of a 700,000
sq.ft. Federal office building in ~300 hours.  Check it out!  I think we
could have done better, but they seem to have done a very good job  ;)

Message-ID: <0BA915866A92F542AA5018A148FE0323467D0A@FGSERVER.fgroup.local>

Hi all,

I'm not sure I understand how eQuest calculates the heating/cooling
equipment loads.

I've built two models with identical envelopes and internal loads etc,
and OA supply.  In model A, we have a boiler and chiller on hot and
chilled water loops and a four-pipe fan coil air-side system.  In model
B, we're using an air cooled Heat Pump and two-pipe fan coils.

In report PS-C for model A, the sum heat load is -29.6 MBTU, whereas for
model B, the sum heat load is -130.2 MBTU.  I understand that the fuel
use should be very different, but I don't know why the load is so
different between the models.  Shouldn't the heating energy delivered to
the spaces be the same in both cases?  Why does the Heat Pump system
have a load that is so much higher than its counterpart?

 

Similarly, in report SS-E, January has 110 Heating load hours for Model
A, and 385 Heating load hours for Model B.  Again, shouldn't the loads
be the same between the two models?  

 

Thanks in advance for the help,

Thanks Brian,

But I'd already examined LS-C, LS-D, SS-C and SS-D.  As one would
expect, LS-C and LS-D are the same for both models.  SS-D, however, is
not.  I guess what I don't understand is what eQuest considers a "load"
to be.  I consider "load" to be the requirements of the space (including
envelope, occupants, and OA), and none of those things have changed
between my models.  The only thing that changes is what system is used
to meet the load.  

SS-D only has a monthly breakdown - but doesn't explain why the loads
are different.

 

Thanks,

Katherine

Look at the SS-D and LS-C reports.  SS-D shows the peak heating &
cooling loads with outdoor air, LS-C shows the same without outdoor air
... but will show components so you can determine where the difference
is.

RE:  ". . . can't find) anything in 621.1 which says that unoccupied ventilation should be zero."

I think this requirement comes from the mandatory provisions of 90.1.

6.4.3.4.3 Shutoff Damper Controls. Both outdoor
air supply and exhaust systems shall be equipped with motorized
dampers that will automatically shut when the systems or
spaces served are not in use. Ventilation outdoor air dampers
shall be capable of automatically shutting off during preoccupancy
building warm-up, cool down, and setback, except
when ventilation reduces energy costs (e.g., night purge) or
when ventilation must be supplied to meet code requirements.

Thoughts??

Dear Patrick,

Thank you for sharing this GBCI response!  It is very informative and, while I won't admit that I've been modeling anything incorrectly, I am going to change a couple of things :).
In particular, I have heard on several occasions that the Increased Ventilation credit was a clear case of "IEQ vs. energy"; you make a decision to trade one against the other.  After reading the GBCI response below and then double-checking with ASHRAE 90.1, I find that they are consistent with each other and effectively allow no penalty for the increased energy caused by increased ventilation.  Very curious, considering there is no science which demonstrates a health benefit for outdoor airflows greater than that required by ASHRAE 62.1!
The other item is that I failed to notice (and still can't find) anything in 621.1 which says that unoccupied ventilation should be zero.  I guess that is OK, but is also curious, since a portion of the ventilation calcs in 62.1 include consideration for off-gassing materials (which are always present.)
All in all, I'm smarter than I was as a result of your post, so it's a good day!  Thanks again.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] usgbc response to outdoor air question

back in september there was a thread about what the outdoor air rate in a baseline simulation should be compared to a proposed simulation, specifically when one is adding 30% more outdoor air to meet the ieqc2 requirement and earn 1 leed point.  there were differences of opinions about the flow rates between baseline and proposed being either the same (as required in 90.1 app g) or the baseline being the calculated per 62.1 and the proposed being as designed.

so i submitted a support request to the usgbc and the reply i received is below, but in short the response is that unless you're using dcv optionally the outdoor air rates in the baseline and proposed energy simulations for eac1 should be the same.  the response below gives the standard responses to differing outdoor air rate scenarios.

Dear Patrick,

Thank you for contacting the Green Building Certification Institute.

You ask very good questions related to the relationship between ASHRAE Standards 62.1 and 90.1, and how these standards are applied across multiple LEED Rating System prerequisites and credits.

The simple answer to your question is that, for systems without demand controlled ventilation, the outdoor air included in EA Credit 1 energy simulations must be the same in the Baseline and Proposed cases. If the project is attempting IEQ Credit 2 Increased Ventilation, then the values calculated in IEQc2 must be used in the EAc1 Basline and Proposed case energy models. Note that IEQc2 does not limit the project to providing only 30% more outdoor air than AHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate Procedure minimums, so higher amounts are acceptable, as long as they are modeled identically in both the Baseline and Proposed case energy models.

The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems that do not have demand controlled ventilation:

It is unclear whether the minimum outside air rates (in CFM) were modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case for all zones not having Demand Control Ventilation in the Proposed case. Please confirm that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed cases using the proposed case rates. Additionally, please verify that all systems in both the baseline and proposed case are modeled with zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case).

The situation becomes a bit more complicated in you have systems that have demand controlled ventilation (often implemented as Carbon Dioxide control of outdoor air or as programmed control of outdoor air based on occupancy sensors.) In this case the Baseline case energy model must include the minimum outdoor air as determined by the ASHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate Procedure calculations for all systems having demand controlled ventilation.

The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems that do have demand controlled ventilation:

Demand control ventilation was modeled for credit in the proposed case. Appendix G allows schedule changes for demand control ventilation as approved by the rating authority (Table G3.1#4(Baseline)). As the LEED Certification rating authority, GBCI requires that the outside air ventilation rates for the Baseline case be modeled using minimum ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or 2007 for LEED-NC 2009 projects) rates wherever credit is taken for demand control ventilation in the Proposed case. The proposed case minimum rates at design conditions should be modeled as designed. Please verify that the Baseline Case model reflects ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or 2007) minimum rates for any spaces where credit is taken for demand control ventilation, or revise the model accordingly. For all other spaces, please confirm that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed cases. Additionally, please verify that all systems in both the baseline and proposed cases are modeled with zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case).

Finally, even though you don't address energy recovery in your question, whether or not you have energy recovery in your ventilation systems may affect how much better (or worse) your Proposed case energy models perform in relation to your Baseline case energy models.

The following generic LEED Review Comment addresses energy recovery in EAc1 energy models as it relates to ventilation systems.

Energy recovery is modeled for credit in the Proposed case. Please provide further information regarding the energy recovery efficiency, verify that outside air is modeled with zero flow in both the Baseline and Proposed cases during unoccupied periods when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed Case), and indicate the bypass mechanism used to bypass the energy recovery during mild conditions.

I hope that helps, but if you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to use the contact form at http://www.gbci.org/contactus and select "Follow up to GBCI Response," inputting your case number from this email's subject line.

CUSTOMER INQUIRY:
I am trying to verify what the minimum outdoor airflow rate required for EAc1 is and am not sure if this requires a CIR.

If the Proposed outdoor air ventilation is a minimum of 30% higher than the minimum required by ASHRAE 62 in order to achieve 1 LEED point for credit IEQC2 is the Baseline outdoor air rate also 30% higher than the minimum required by ASHRAE 62? or would the Baseline outdoor air ventilation rate be the minimum outdoor air rate per ASHRAE 62 calculations.

In other words, if ASHRAE 62 requires a minimum of 1,000 CFM of outdoor air, and 1,300 CFM is provided to attain 1 LEED point via IEQC1, is the Baseline outdoor air flow rate 1,000 CFM or 1,300 CFM in the energy simulation?

90.1-2007/2004 both say the minimu    m outdoor airflow rates shall be the same for both the proposed and baseline building designs, as does the user manual.

But this logic seems to reward the Proposed simulation by conditioning the additional outdoor air supplied (300 cfm in the example above) to achieve IEQC1 in the Baseline system as well as the proposed.

The logic of using the minimum required in the Baseline case is reflected in EAC1 in the equipment efficiency requirements. Baseline efficiencies are the minimum required, e.g. SEER 13 for packaged units.

It is the intent of the requirement that I am not sure is clear. Increasing the outdoor air ventilation rate increases the energy used to condition the outdoor air, so if the intent is to put the onus on Proposed design to show energy reduction/LEED compliance over the 90.1/62 requirements shouldn't the Baseline outdoor air be the minimum air flow rate per the ASHRAE 62 calculations? This puts the onus on the design team to provide a design that compensates for the increase in energy to meet IEQC2 by providing some method of processing the increase in outdoor air while still reducing energy consumption.

Ouch!
In the Model energy code in Canada only up to 20% 
more than ASHRAE 62 is allowed in the base 
case.  Imagine a building with 100% more OA and a 
ERV of 70% on the proposed case it can easily 
reach 10 EAcr1 point especially in cold climate.

While ASHRAE 90.1 does a pretty good job of defining higher efficiency
practices, it?s not perfect.  On the other hand, that?s why Appendix G is
there; you can show why your idea is better, at least on the energy part of
things.

There are still issues with the general level of knowledge among both the
reviewer community as well as the energy modeling community, and that may
never cease.  As is commonly the case, a designer often is facing either
(energy efficiency) / or (greater IAQ & productivity).  The challenge is how
to get the best combination of both.

One benefit of LEED certification seems to have been that many engineer
designers have responded to the challenge of greater efficiency and
performance and changed their standard designs in favor of something with
better performance.  That?s probably very good, largely because stagnation
is never good.

There certainly is experimentation going on, not all of which is producing
great results, but I still prefer a real attitude of ?continuous
improvement? over stagnation!

Ouch!
In the Model energy code in Canada only up to 20% more than ASHRAE 62 is
allowed in the base case.  Imagine a building with 100% more OA and a ERV of
70% on the proposed case it can easily reach 10 EAcr1 point especially in

I think this requirement comes from the mandatory provisions of 90.1.
 
6.4.3.4.3 Shutoff Damper Controls. Both outdoor
air supply and exhaust systems shall be equipped with motorized
dampers that will automatically shut when the systems or
spaces served are not in use. Ventilation outdoor air dampers
shall be capable of automatically shutting off during preoccupancy
building warm-up, cool down, and setback, except
when ventilation reduces energy costs (e.g., night purge) or
when ventilation must be supplied to meet code requirements.

Dear Patrick,
 
Thank you for sharing this GBCI response!  It is very informative and, while
I won?t admit that I?ve been modeling anything incorrectly, I am going to
change a couple of things J.
In particular, I have heard on several occasions that the Increased
Ventilation credit was a clear case of ?IEQ vs. energy?; you make a decision
to trade one against the other.  After reading the GBCI response below and
then double-checking with ASHRAE 90.1, I find that they are consistent with
each other and effectively allow no penalty for the increased energy caused
by increased ventilation.  Very curious, considering there is no science
which demonstrates a health benefit for outdoor airflows greater than that
required by ASHRAE 62.1!
The other item is that I failed to notice (and still can?t find) anything in
621.1 which says that unoccupied ventilation should be zero.  I guess that
is OK, but is also curious, since a portion of the ventilation calcs in 62.1
include consideration for off-gassing materials (which are always present.)
All in all, I?m smarter than I was as a result of your post, so it?s a good
day!  Thanks again.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] usgbc response to outdoor air question
 
back in september there was a thread about what the outdoor air rate in a
baseline simulation should be compared to a proposed simulation,
specifically when one is adding 30% more outdoor air to meet the ieqc2
requirement and earn 1 leed point.  there were differences of opinions about
the flow rates between baseline and proposed being either the same (as
required in 90.1 app g) or the baseline being the calculated per 62.1 and
the proposed being as designed.

so i submitted a support request to the usgbc and the reply i received is
below, but in short the response is that unless you're using dcv optionally
the outdoor air rates in the baseline and proposed energy simulations for
eac1 should be the same.  the response below gives the standard responses to
differing outdoor air rate scenarios.

Dear Patrick,

Thank you for contacting the Green Building Certification Institute. 

You ask very good questions related to the relationship between ASHRAE
Standards 62.1 and 90.1, and how these standards are applied across multiple
LEED Rating System prerequisites and credits.

The simple answer to your question is that, for systems without demand
controlled ventilation, the outdoor air included in EA Credit 1 energy
simulations must be the same in the Baseline and Proposed cases. If the
project is attempting IEQ Credit 2 Increased Ventilation, then the values
calculated in IEQc2 must be used in the EAc1 Basline and Proposed case
energy models. Note that IEQc2 does not limit the project to providing only
30% more outdoor air than AHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate Procedure minimums, so
higher amounts are acceptable, as long as they are modeled identically in
both the Baseline and Proposed case energy models.

The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems
that do not have demand controlled ventilation:

It is unclear whether the minimum outside air rates (in CFM) were modeled
identically in the Baseline and Proposed case for all zones not having
Demand Control Ventilation in the Proposed case. Please confirm that minimum
outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled identically in the Baseline
and Proposed cases using the proposed case rates. Additionally, please
verify that all systems in both the baseline and proposed case are modeled
with zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied
setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an
alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the
unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline
and Proposed case).

The situation becomes a bit more complicated in you have systems that have
demand controlled ventilation (often implemented as Carbon Dioxide control
of outdoor air or as programmed control of outdoor air based on occupancy
sensors.) In this case the Baseline case energy model must include the
minimum outdoor air as determined by the ASHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate
Procedure calculations for all systems having demand controlled ventilation.


The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems
that do have demand controlled ventilation:

Demand control ventilation was modeled for credit in the proposed case.
Appendix G allows schedule changes for demand control ventilation as
approved by the rating authority (Table G3.1#4(Baseline)). As the LEED
Certification rating authority, GBCI requires that the outside air
ventilation rates for the Baseline case be modeled using minimum ASHRAE
62.1-2004 (or 2007 for LEED-NC 2009 projects) rates wherever credit is taken
for demand control ventilation in the Proposed case. The proposed case
minimum rates at design conditions should be modeled as designed. Please
verify that the Baseline Case model reflects ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or 2007)
minimum rates for any spaces where credit is taken for demand control
ventilation, or revise the model accordingly. For all other spaces, please
confirm that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled
identically in the Baseline and Proposed cases. Additionally, please verify
that all systems in both the baseline and proposed cases are modeled with
zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback
temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate
minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied
outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed
case).

Finally, even though you don't address energy recovery in your question,
whether or not you have energy recovery in your ventilation systems may
affect how much better (or worse) your Proposed case energy models perform
in relation to your Baseline case energy models. 

The following generic LEED Review Comment addresses energy recovery in EAc1
energy models as it relates to ventilation systems.

Energy recovery is modeled for credit in the Proposed case. Please provide
further information regarding the energy recovery efficiency, verify that
outside air is modeled with zero flow in both the Baseline and Proposed
cases during unoccupied periods when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied
setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an
alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the
unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline
and Proposed Case), and indicate the bypass mechanism used to bypass the
energy recovery during mild conditions. 

I hope that helps, but if you have any further questions or concerns, please

official rulings in advance of a LEED Certification Review, customers should
utilize the Formal Inquiries process available in LEED Online that results
in a Project Credit Interpretation Ruling (Project CIR) and possibly a LEED
Interpretation (formerly CIRs or Public Rulings). Applications for LEED

CUSTOMER EMAIL ADDRESS:

CUSTOMER INQUIRY:
I am trying to verify what the minimum outdoor airflow rate required for
EAc1 is and am not sure if this requires a CIR. 

If the Proposed outdoor air ventilation is a minimum of 30% higher than the
minimum required by ASHRAE 62 in order to achieve 1 LEED point for credit
IEQC2 is the Baseline outdoor air rate also 30% higher than the minimum
required by ASHRAE 62? or would the Baseline outdoor air ventilation rate be
the minimum outdoor air rate per ASHRAE 62 calculations. 

In other words, if ASHRAE 62 requires a minimum of 1,000 CFM of outdoor air,
and 1,300 CFM is provided to attain 1 LEED point via IEQC1, is the Baseline
outdoor air flow rate 1,000 CFM or 1,300 CFM in the energy simulation? 

90.1-2007/2004 both say the minimu    m outdoor airflow rates shall be the
same for both the proposed and baseline building designs, as does the user
manual. 

But this logic seems to reward the Proposed simulation by conditioning the
additional outdoor air supplied (300 cfm in the example above) to achieve
IEQC1 in the Baseline system as well as the proposed. 

The logic of using the minimum required in the Baseline case is reflected in
EAC1 in the equipment efficiency requirements. Baseline efficiencies are the
minimum required, e.g. SEER 13 for packaged units. 

It is the intent of the requirement that I am not sure is clear. Increasing
the outdoor air ventilation rate increases the energy used to condition the
outdoor air, so if the intent is to put the onus on Proposed design to show
energy reduction/LEED compliance over the 90.1/62 requirements shouldn't the
Baseline outdoor air be the minimum air flow rate per the ASHRAE 62
calculations? This puts the onus on the design team to provide a design that
compensates for the increase in energy to meet IEQC2 by providing some
method of processing the increase in outdoor air while still reducing energy
consumption.

There was an earlier discussion on the list about this:

 

62.1-2007, Section 5.4 states "Mechanical ventilation systems shall
include controls, manual or automatic, that enable the fan system to
operate whenever the spaces served are occupied.  The system shall be
designed to maintain the minimum outdoor airflow as required by Section
6 under any load condition."

 

62.1-2007, Section 6.2.6.1 states "Ventilation systems shall be designed
to be capable of providing the required ventilation rates in the
breathing zone whenever the zones served by the system are occupied,
including all full- and part-load conditions."

 

These are generally applied to mean that the system is not required to
operate when spaces are unoccupied.  Yes, the standard does not
explicitly state that unoccupied ventilation should be zero but the
standard does not explicitly state that unoccupied ventilation can't be
zero.  Section 5.4 and 6.2.6.1 only require controls and ventilation
rates "whenever the spaces/zones served by the system are occupied" so
it can be implied that the requirement doesn't apply when the
spaces/zones are unoccupied.  There's a fine interpretive line there,
but many of the official interpretations on 62.1 also lean this
direction.  If in doubt, put in an official interpretation request
specifically on this with ASHRAE on the topic to clarify.

I think this requirement comes from the mandatory provisions of 90.1.

 

6.4.3.4.3 Shutoff Damper Controls. Both outdoor

air supply and exhaust systems shall be equipped with motorized

dampers that will automatically shut when the systems or

spaces served are not in use. Ventilation outdoor air dampers

shall be capable of automatically shutting off during preoccupancy

building warm-up, cool down, and setback, except

when ventilation reduces energy costs (e.g., night purge) or

when ventilation must be supplied to meet code requirements.

 

Thoughts??

Dear Patrick,

 

Thank you for sharing this GBCI response!  It is very informative and,
while I won't admit that I've been modeling anything incorrectly, I am
going to change a couple of things J.

In particular, I have heard on several occasions that the Increased
Ventilation credit was a clear case of "IEQ vs. energy"; you make a
decision to trade one against the other.  After reading the GBCI
response below and then double-checking with ASHRAE 90.1, I find that
they are consistent with each other and effectively allow no penalty for
the increased energy caused by increased ventilation.  Very curious,
considering there is no science which demonstrates a health benefit for
outdoor airflows greater than that required by ASHRAE 62.1!

The other item is that I failed to notice (and still can't find)
anything in 621.1 which says that unoccupied ventilation should be zero.
I guess that is OK, but is also curious, since a portion of the
ventilation calcs in 62.1 include consideration for off-gassing
materials (which are always present.)

All in all, I'm smarter than I was as a result of your post, so it's a
good day!  Thanks again.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] usgbc response to outdoor air question

 

back in september there was a thread about what the outdoor air rate in
a baseline simulation should be compared to a proposed simulation,
specifically when one is adding 30% more outdoor air to meet the ieqc2
requirement and earn 1 leed point.  there were differences of opinions
about the flow rates between baseline and proposed being either the same
(as required in 90.1 app g) or the baseline being the calculated per
62.1 and the proposed being as designed.

so i submitted a support request to the usgbc and the reply i received
is below, but in short the response is that unless you're using dcv
optionally the outdoor air rates in the baseline and proposed energy
simulations for eac1 should be the same.  the response below gives the
standard responses to differing outdoor air rate scenarios.

Dear Patrick,

Thank you for contacting the Green Building Certification Institute. 

You ask very good questions related to the relationship between ASHRAE
Standards 62.1 and 90.1, and how these standards are applied across
multiple LEED Rating System prerequisites and credits.

The simple answer to your question is that, for systems without demand
controlled ventilation, the outdoor air included in EA Credit 1 energy
simulations must be the same in the Baseline and Proposed cases. If the
project is attempting IEQ Credit 2 Increased Ventilation, then the
values calculated in IEQc2 must be used in the EAc1 Basline and Proposed
case energy models. Note that IEQc2 does not limit the project to
providing only 30% more outdoor air than AHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate
Procedure minimums, so higher amounts are acceptable, as long as they
are modeled identically in both the Baseline and Proposed case energy
models.

The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems
that do not have demand controlled ventilation:

It is unclear whether the minimum outside air rates (in CFM) were
modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case for all zones not
having Demand Control Ventilation in the Proposed case. Please confirm
that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled identically
in the Baseline and Proposed cases using the proposed case rates.
Additionally, please verify that all systems in both the baseline and
proposed case are modeled with zero outside air flow when fans are
cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or
safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied
periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be
modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case).

The situation becomes a bit more complicated in you have systems that
have demand controlled ventilation (often implemented as Carbon Dioxide
control of outdoor air or as programmed control of outdoor air based on
occupancy sensors.) In this case the Baseline case energy model must
include the minimum outdoor air as determined by the ASHRAE 62.1
Ventilation Rate Procedure calculations for all systems having demand
controlled ventilation. 

The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems
that do have demand controlled ventilation:

Demand control ventilation was modeled for credit in the proposed case.
Appendix G allows schedule changes for demand control ventilation as
approved by the rating authority (Table G3.1#4(Baseline)). As the LEED
Certification rating authority, GBCI requires that the outside air
ventilation rates for the Baseline case be modeled using minimum ASHRAE
62.1-2004 (or 2007 for LEED-NC 2009 projects) rates wherever credit is
taken for demand control ventilation in the Proposed case. The proposed
case minimum rates at design conditions should be modeled as designed.
Please verify that the Baseline Case model reflects ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or
2007) minimum rates for any spaces where credit is taken for demand
control ventilation, or revise the model accordingly. For all other
spaces, please confirm that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm)
was modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed cases.
Additionally, please verify that all systems in both the baseline and
proposed cases are modeled with zero outside air flow when fans are
cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or
safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied
periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be
modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case).

Finally, even though you don't address energy recovery in your question,
whether or not you have energy recovery in your ventilation systems may
affect how much better (or worse) your Proposed case energy models
perform in relation to your Baseline case energy models. 

The following generic LEED Review Comment addresses energy recovery in
EAc1 energy models as it relates to ventilation systems.

Energy recovery is modeled for credit in the Proposed case. Please
provide further information regarding the energy recovery efficiency,
verify that outside air is modeled with zero flow in both the Baseline
and Proposed cases during unoccupied periods when fans are cycled on to
meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations
mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which
case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in
the Baseline and Proposed Case), and indicate the bypass mechanism used
to bypass the energy recovery during mild conditions. 

I hope that helps, but if you have any further questions or concerns,
please feel free to use the contact form at

CUSTOMER INQUIRY:
I am trying to verify what the minimum outdoor airflow rate required for
EAc1 is and am not sure if this requires a CIR. 

If the Proposed outdoor air ventilation is a minimum of 30% higher than
the minimum required by ASHRAE 62 in order to achieve 1 LEED point for
credit IEQC2 is the Baseline outdoor air rate also 30% higher than the
minimum required by ASHRAE 62? or would the Baseline outdoor air
ventilation rate be the minimum outdoor air rate per ASHRAE 62
calculations. 

In other words, if ASHRAE 62 requires a minimum of 1,000 CFM of outdoor
air, and 1,300 CFM is provided to attain 1 LEED point via IEQC1, is the
Baseline outdoor air flow rate 1,000 CFM or 1,300 CFM in the energy
simulation? 

90.1-2007/2004 both say the minimu    m outdoor airflow rates shall be
the same for both the proposed and baseline building designs, as does
the user manual. 

But this logic seems to reward the Proposed simulation by conditioning
the additional outdoor air supplied (300 cfm in the example above) to
achieve IEQC1 in the Baseline system as well as the proposed. 

The logic of using the minimum required in the Baseline case is
reflected in EAC1 in the equipment efficiency requirements. Baseline
efficiencies are the minimum required, e.g. SEER 13 for packaged units. 

It is the intent of the requirement that I am not sure is clear.
Increasing the outdoor air ventilation rate increases the energy used to
condition the outdoor air, so if the intent is to put the onus on
Proposed design to show energy reduction/LEED compliance over the
90.1/62 requirements shouldn't the Baseline outdoor air be the minimum
air flow rate per the ASHRAE 62 calculations? This puts the onus on the
design team to provide a design that compensates for the increase in
energy to meet IEQC2 by providing some method of processing the increase
in outdoor air while still reducing energy consumption.

SimBuild 2012

5th National Conference of IBPSA-USA
August 1 - 3, 2012 ? Madison, WI

Call for Abstracts

IBPSA-USA is soliciting abstracts for its fifth biennial conference on 
building performance simulation, SimBuild 2012. Please note that 
December 1st, 2011 is the deadline for all abstracts.

The conference organizers are limiting the number of peer-reviewed oral 
presentations in order to maintain a high level of quality in the 
papers. Submissions will therefore be rigorously peer-reviewed. Paper 
submissions should deal with computer-based building performance 
simulation (BPS) with the scope ranging from individual building 
components to whole buildings and neighborhoods. Basic phenomena of 
interest include the modeling of heat and mass transfer, air movement, 
natural and electric light as well as controls and occupant behavior. 
Other suitable topics include new developments in tools for modeling and 
simulation, automated optimization during design and operations, 
stochastic modeling and data visualization, the generation of climate 
datasets and successful applications of BPS in design practice (case 
studies), incentive programs, building operations and education.

In addition to the technical papers, a limited number of 
non-peer-reviewed oral presentations will be sought in order to enable 
practitioners and researchers to address simulation-related issues such 
as: the future of BEM software; modeling controls in BEM software; use 
of simulation in real-time to support building operation; dealing with 
uncertainty in building performance simulation; validation, calibration 
and verification of simulation using real time data; model predictive 
control in buildings; use of BEM in a building system fault finding 
capacity; appropriate modeling for the different phases of a building 
design; and case studies of the application of modeling in building design.

The meeting is open to all, world-wide. Madison is located in the middle 
of the US near to Chicago and Minneapolis. The conference will be held 
at The Madison Concourse Hotel in downtown Madison.

Submission of Abstracts:

Abstracts are due by December 1st, 2011 and should be a maximum of 200 
words. Abstracts should be submitted through the SimBuild 2012 website.

Hello all,

I am writing to encourage you participate in the public review of DOE's job
task analysis for energy modelers. Back in April, about 15 energy modeling
professionals (myself included) came up with this draft job description
(including required skills and knowledge) for energy modelers. This
document will provide the foundation for future education, training and
certification programs. It is likely that existing programs, such as the
BEMP certification, will need to show compliance with this.

For these reasons, I urge you to review and comment on this document! If
you think its sufficient and doesn't have gaps, that would also be helpful
to hear. The review period closes November 28, 2011.

Hi,

I'm modelling single family dwellings in EnergyPlus, and I am wondering about the accuracy of the typical assumption that the zones are fully mixed .

The results of my modelling are showing that the high ratio of ceiling insulation to wall insulation required by the codes (BC and Canada) seems to higher than practical (i.e. no point having an R50 roof if your walls are only R16). However, this is making me wonder if I should be trying to account for the stratification that occurs in reality (which would increase losses through the roof).

Anyone have any experience with modelling stratification in a scenario like this? Or know of some empirical studies where the stratification has been measured? I'm pretty sure I can set up a temperature gradient in the zone if I know what it should be...

Thanks!

If the project is attempting IEQ Credit 2 Increased Ventilation, then the values calculated in IEQc2 must be used in the EAc1 Basline and Proposed case energy models. Note that IEQc2 does not limit the project to providing only 30% more outdoor air than AHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate Procedure minimums, so higher amounts are acceptable, as long as they are modeled identically in both the Baseline and Proposed case energy models.

Additionally, please verify that all systems in both the baseline and proposed case are modeled with zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case).

> Demand control ventilation was modeled for credit in the proposed case. Appendix G allows schedule changes for demand control ventilation as approved by the rating authority (Table G3.1#4(Baseline)). As the LEED Certification rating authority, GBCI requires that the outside air ventilation rates for the Baseline case be modeled using minimum ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or 2007 for LEED-NC 2009 projects) rates wherever credit is taken for demand control ventilation in the Proposed case. The proposed case minimum rates at design conditions should be modeled as designed. Please verify that the Baseline Case model reflects ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or 2007) minimum rates for any spaces where credit is taken for demand control ventilation, or revise the model accordingly. For all other spaces, please confirm that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed cases. Additionally, please verify that all systems in both the baseline and proposed cases are modeled with zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case).

Increasing the outdoor air ventilation rate increases the energy used to condition the outdoor air, so if the intent is to put the onus on Proposed design to show energy reduction/LEED compliance over the 90.1/62 requirements shouldn't the Baseline outdoor air be the minimum air flow rate per the ASHRAE 62 calculations? This puts the onus on the design team to provide a design that compensates for the increase in energy to meet IEQC2 by providing some method of processing the increase in outdoor air while still reducing energy consumption.

Increasing the outdoor air ventilation rate increases the energy used to condition the outdoor air, so if the intent is to put the onus on Proposed design to show energy reduction/LEED compliance over the 90.1/62 requirements shouldn't the Baseline outdoor air be the minimum air flow rate per the ASHRAE 62 calculations? This puts the onus on the design team to provide a design that compensates for the increase in energy to meet IEQC2 by providing some method of processing the increase in outdoor air while still reducing energy consumption.

Yes, the standard does not explicitly state that unoccupied ventilation should be zero but the standard does not explicitly state that unoccupied ventilation can?t be zero.  Section 5.4 and 6.2.6.1 only require controls and ventilation rates ?whenever the spaces/zones served by the system are occupied? so it can be implied that the requirement doesn?t apply when the spaces/zones are unoccupied.  There?s a fine interpretive line there, but many of the official interpretations on 62.1 also lean this direction.  If in doubt, put in an official interpretation request specifically on this with ASHRAE on the topic to clarify.

Increasing the outdoor air ventilation rate increases the energy used to condition the outdoor air, so if the intent is to put the onus on Proposed design to show energy reduction/LEED compliance over the 90.1/62 requirements shouldn't the Baseline outdoor air be the minimum air flow rate per the ASHRAE 62 calculations? This puts the onus on the design team to provide a design that compensates for the increase in energy to meet IEQC2 by providing some method of processing the increase in outdoor air while still reducing energy consumption.

Very good point. The purpose of using the assumption of well-mixed air is
due to the constrain of current heat balance thermal engine employed in
most simulation program. It is not easy to increase the "nodes" due to
extensive iteration triggered. However, what I can suggest is try to divide
single space into smaller ones along the stratified path. Although in each
smaller space, the air will still be well mixed, different set points can
be assigned in order to reflect the stratified effect. meanwhile, the
internal heat gain should be assigned into smaller spaces accurately. I can
foresee your hypothesis is correct that high roof R value will contribute
to minimizing heat loss through the roof.

Cheney

On a somewhat similar issue, has anyone validated a bulk airflow simulation of a nat. vent. / 'solar' chimney design as a simplified alternate to a cfd or wind tunnel study?

It is not easy to increase the "nodes" due to extensive iteration triggered. However, what I can suggest is try to divide single space into smaller ones along the stratified path. Although in each smaller space, the air will still be well mixed, different set points can be assigned in order to reflect the stratified effect. meanwhile, the internal heat gain should be assigned into smaller spaces accurately. I can foresee your hypothesis is correct that high roof R value will contribute to minimizing heat loss through the roof.

>> 
>> You ask very good questions related to the relationship between ASHRAE Standards 62.1 and 90.1, and how these standards are applied across multiple LEED Rating System prerequisites and credits.
>> 
>> The simple answer to your question is that, for systems without demand controlled ventilation, the outdoor air included in EA Credit 1 energy simulations must be the same in the Baseline and Proposed cases. If the project is attempting IEQ Credit 2 Increased Ventilation, then the values calculated in IEQc2 must be used in the EAc1 Basline and Proposed case energy models. Note that IEQc2 does not limit the project to providing only 30% more outdoor air than AHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate Procedure minimums, so higher amounts are acceptable, as long as they are modeled identically in both the Baseline and Proposed case energy models.
>> 
>> The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems that do not have demand controlled ventilation:
>> 
>> It is unclear whether the minimum outside air rates (in CFM) were modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case for all zones not having Demand Control Ventilation in the Proposed case. Please confirm that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed cases using the proposed case rates. Additionally, please verify that all systems in both the baseline and proposed case are modeled with zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case).
>> 
>> The situation becomes a bit more complicated in you have systems that have demand controlled ventilation (often implemented as Carbon Dioxide control of outdoor air or as programmed control of outdoor air based on occupancy sensors.) In this case the Baseline case energy model must include the minimum outdoor air as determined by the ASHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate Procedure calculations for all systems having demand controlled ventilation. 
>> 
>> The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems that do have demand controlled ventilation:
>> 
>> Demand control ventilation was modeled for credit in the proposed case. Appendix G allows schedule changes for demand control ventilation as approved by the rating authority (Table G3.1#4(Baseline)). As the LEED Certification rating authority, GBCI requires that the outside air ventilation rates for the Baseline case be modeled using minimum ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or 2007 for LEED-NC 2009 projects) rates wherever credit is taken for demand control ventilation in the Proposed case. The proposed case minimum rates at design conditions should be modeled as designed. Please verify that the Baseline Case model reflects ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or 2007) minimum rates for any spaces where credit is taken for demand control ventilation, or revise the model accordingly. For all other spaces, please confirm that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed cases. Additionally, please verify that all systems in both the baseline and proposed cases are modeled with zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case).
>> 
>> Finally, even though you don't address energy recovery in your question, whether or not you have energy recovery in your ventilation systems may affect how much better (or worse) your Proposed case energy models perform in relation to your Baseline case energy models. 
>> 
>> The following generic LEED Review Comment addresses energy recovery in EAc1 energy models as it relates to ventilation systems.
>> 
>> Energy recovery is modeled for credit in the Proposed case. Please provide further information regarding the energy recovery efficiency, verify that outside air is modeled with zero flow in both the Baseline and Proposed cases during unoccupied periods when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed Case), and indicate the bypass mechanism used to bypass the energy recovery during mild conditions.

>> I am trying to verify what the minimum outdoor airflow rate required for EAc1 is and am not sure if this requires a CIR. 
>> 
>> If the Proposed outdoor air ventilation is a minimum of 30% higher than the minimum required by ASHRAE 62 in order to achieve 1 LEED point for credit IEQC2 is the Baseline outdoor air rate also 30% higher than the minimum required by ASHRAE 62? or would the Baseline outdoor air ventilation rate be the minimum outdoor air rate per ASHRAE 62 calculations. 
>> 
>> In other words, if ASHRAE 62 requires a minimum of 1,000 CFM of outdoor air, and 1,300 CFM is provided to attain 1 LEED point via IEQC1, is the Baseline outdoor air flow rate 1,000 CFM or 1,300 CFM in the energy simulation? 
>> 
>> 90.1-2007/2004 both say the minimu    m outdoor airflow rates shall be the same for both the proposed and baseline building designs, as does the user manual. 
>> 
>> But this logic seems to reward the Proposed simulation by conditioning the additional outdoor air supplied (300 cfm in the example above) to achieve IEQC1 in the Baseline system as well as the proposed. 
>> 
>> The logic of using the minimum required in the Baseline case is reflected in EAC1 in the equipment efficiency requirements. Baseline efficiencies are the minimum required, e.g. SEER 13 for packaged units. 
>> 
>> It is the intent of the requirement that I am not sure is clear. Increasing the outdoor air ventilation rate increases the energy used to condition the outdoor air, so if the intent is to put the onus on Proposed design to show energy reduction/LEED compliance over the 90.1/62 requirements shouldn't the Baseline outdoor air be the minimum air flow rate per the ASHRAE 62 calculations? This puts the onus on the design team to provide a design that compensates for the increase in energy to meet IEQC2 by providing some method of processing the increase in outdoor air while still reducing energy consumption.

>> Thank you for contacting the Green Building Certification Institute. 
>> 
>> You ask very good questions related to the relationship between ASHRAE Standards 62.1 and 90.1, and how these standards are applied across multiple LEED Rating System prerequisites and credits.
>> 
>> The simple answer to your question is that, for systems without demand controlled ventilation, the outdoor air included in EA Credit 1 energy simulations must be the same in the Baseline and Proposed cases. If the project is attempting IEQ Credit 2 Increased Ventilation, then the values calculated in IEQc2 must be used in the EAc1 Basline and Proposed case energy models. Note that IEQc2 does not limit the project to providing only 30% more outdoor air than AHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate Procedure minimums, so higher amounts are acceptable, as long as they are modeled identically in both the Baseline and Proposed case energy models.
>> 
>> The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems that do not have demand controlled ventilation:
>> 
>> It is unclear whether the minimum outside air rates (in CFM) were modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case for all zones not having Demand Control Ventilation in the Proposed case. Please confirm that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed cases using the proposed case rates. Additionally, please verify that all systems in both the baseline and proposed case are modeled with zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case).
>> 
>> The situation becomes a bit more complicated in you have systems that have demand controlled ventilation (often implemented as Carbon Dioxide control of outdoor air or as programmed control of outdoor air based on occupancy sensors.) In this case the Baseline case energy model must include the minimum outdoor air as determined by the ASHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate Procedure calculations for all systems having demand controlled ventilation. 
>> 
>> The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems that do have demand controlled ventilation:
>> 
>> Demand control ventilation was modeled for credit in the proposed case. Appendix G allows schedule changes for demand control ventilation as approved by the rating authority (Table G3.1#4(Baseline)). As the LEED Certification rating authority, GBCI requires that the outside air ventilation rates for the Baseline case be modeled using minimum ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or 2007 for LEED-NC 2009 projects) rates wherever credit is taken for demand control ventilation in the Proposed case. The proposed case minimum rates at design conditions should be modeled as designed. Please verify that the Baseline Case model reflects ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or 2007) minimum rates for any spaces where credit is taken for demand control ventilation, or revise the model accordingly. For all other spaces, please confirm that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed cases. Additionally, please verify that all systems in both the baseline and proposed cases are modeled with zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case).
>> 
>> Finally, even though you don't address energy recovery in your question, whether or not you have energy recovery in your ventilation systems may affect how much better (or worse) your Proposed case energy models perform in relation to your Baseline case energy models. 
>> 
>> The following generic LEED Review Comment addresses energy recovery in EAc1 energy models as it relates to ventilation systems.
>> 
>> Energy recovery is modeled for credit in the Proposed case. Please provide further information regarding the energy recovery efficiency, verify that outside air is modeled with zero flow in both the Baseline and Proposed cases during unoccupied periods when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed Case), and indicate the bypass mechanism used to bypass the energy recovery during mild conditions.

>> I am trying to verify what the minimum outdoor airflow rate required for EAc1 is and am not sure if this requires a CIR. 
>> 
>> If the Proposed outdoor air ventilation is a minimum of 30% higher than the minimum required by ASHRAE 62 in order to achieve 1 LEED point for credit IEQC2 is the Baseline outdoor air rate also 30% higher than the minimum required by ASHRAE 62? or would the Baseline outdoor air ventilation rate be the minimum outdoor air rate per ASHRAE 62 calculations. 
>> 
>> In other words, if ASHRAE 62 requires a minimum of 1,000 CFM of outdoor air, and 1,300 CFM is provided to attain 1 LEED point via IEQC1, is the Baseline outdoor air flow rate 1,000 CFM or 1,300 CFM in the energy simulation? 
>> 
>> 90.1-2007/2004 both say the minimu    m outdoor airflow rates shall be the same for both the proposed and baseline building designs, as does the user manual. 
>> 
>> But this logic seems to reward the Proposed simulation by conditioning the additional outdoor air supplied (300 cfm in the example above) to achieve IEQC1 in the Baseline system as well as the proposed. 
>> 
>> The logic of using the minimum required in the Baseline case is reflected in EAC1 in the equipment efficiency requirements. Baseline efficiencies are the minimum required, e.g. SEER 13 for packaged units. 
>> 
>> It is the intent of the requirement that I am not sure is clear. Increasing the outdoor air ventilation rate increases the energy used to condition the outdoor air, so if the intent is to put the onus on Proposed design to show energy reduction/LEED compliance over the 90.1/62 requirements shouldn't the Baseline outdoor air be the minimum air flow rate per the ASHRAE 62 calculations? This puts the onus on the design team to provide a design that compensates for the increase in energy to meet IEQC2 by providing some method of processing the increase in outdoor air while still reducing energy consumption.

>> These are generally applied to mean that the system is not required to operate when spaces are unoccupied.  Yes, the standard does not explicitly state that unoccupied ventilation should be zero but the standard does not explicitly state that unoccupied ventilation can?t be zero.  Section 5.4 and 6.2.6.1 only require controls and ventilation rates ?whenever the spaces/zones served by the system are occupied? so it can be implied that the requirement doesn?t apply when the spaces/zones are unoccupied.  There?s a fine interpretive line there, but many of the official interpretations on 62.1 also lean this direction.  If in doubt, put in an official interpretation request specifically on this with ASHRAE on the topic to clarify.

>> CUSTOMER INQUIRY:
>> I am trying to verify what the minimum outdoor airflow rate required for EAc1 is and am not sure if this requires a CIR. 
>> 
>> If the Proposed outdoor air ventilation is a minimum of 30% higher than the minimum required by ASHRAE 62 in order to achieve 1 LEED point for credit IEQC2 is the Baseline outdoor air rate also 30% higher than the minimum required by ASHRAE 62? or would the Baseline outdoor air ventilation rate be the minimum outdoor air rate per ASHRAE 62 calculations. 
>> 
>> In other words, if ASHRAE 62 requires a minimum of 1,000 CFM of outdoor air, and 1,300 CFM is provided to attain 1 LEED point via IEQC1, is the Baseline outdoor air flow rate 1,000 CFM or 1,300 CFM in the energy simulation? 
>> 
>> 90.1-2007/2004 both say the minimu    m outdoor airflow rates shall be the same for both the proposed and baseline building designs, as does the user manual. 
>> 
>> But this logic seems to reward the Proposed simulation by conditioning the additional outdoor air supplied (300 cfm in the example above) to achieve IEQC1 in the Baseline system as well as the proposed. 
>> 
>> The logic of using the minimum required in the Baseline case is reflected in EAC1 in the equipment efficiency requirements. Baseline efficiencies are the minimum required, e.g. SEER 13 for packaged units. 
>> 
>> It is the intent of the requirement that I am not sure is clear. Increasing the outdoor air ventilation rate increases the energy used to condition the outdoor air, so if the intent is to put the onus on Proposed design to show energy reduction/LEED compliance over the 90.1/62 requirements shouldn't the Baseline outdoor air be the minimum air flow rate per the ASHRAE 62 calculations? This puts the onus on the design team to provide a design that compensates for the increase in energy to meet IEQC2 by providing some method of processing the increase in outdoor air while still reducing energy consumption.

Hey Arpan,

This paper from CU Boulder (
http://rp.ashrae.biz/page/ASHRAE-D-RP-1456-20110405.pdf) compares several
bulk airflow models (COMIS, CONTAM, EnergyPlus, ESP-r) with lab
experiments.  They examine wind-driven, bouyancy-driven and combined-driven
flows.  There's a long list of references at the end too.

>> You ask very good questions related to the relationship between ASHRAE

>> The simple answer to your question is that, for systems without demand

>>
>> The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems

>>
>> The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems

>> You ask very good questions related to the relationship between ASHRAE

>>
>> The simple answer to your question is that, for systems without demand

>> in both the Baseline and Proposed case energy models.
>>
>> The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems
>> that do not have demand controlled ventilation:
>>
>> It is unclear whether the minimum outside air rates (in CFM) were modeled
>> identically in the Baseline and Proposed case for all zones not having

>>
>> The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems

>> 62.1-2004 (or 2007 for LEED-NC 2009 projects) rates wherever credit is
>> taken for demand control ventilation in the Proposed case. The proposed
>> case minimum rates at design conditions should be modeled as designed.
>> Please verify that the Baseline Case model reflects ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or

>> Dear Patrick,
>>
>> Thank you for contacting the Green Building Certification Institute.
>>
>> You ask very good questions related to the relationship between ASHRAE
>> Standards 62.1 and 90.1, and how these standards are applied across
>> multiple LEED Rating System prerequisites and credits.
>>
>> The simple answer to your question is that, for systems without demand
>> controlled ventilation, the outdoor air included in EA Credit 1 energy
>> simulations must be the same in the Baseline and Proposed cases. If the
>> project is attempting IEQ Credit 2 Increased Ventilation, then the values
>> calculated in IEQc2 must be used in the EAc1 Basline and Proposed case
>> energy models. Note that IEQc2 does not limit the project to providing only
>> 30% more outdoor air than AHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate Procedure minimums,
>> so higher amounts are acceptable, as long as they are modeled identically
>> in both the Baseline and Proposed case energy models.
>>
>> The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems
>> that do not have demand controlled ventilation:
>>
>> It is unclear whether the minimum outside air rates (in CFM) were modeled
>> identically in the Baseline and Proposed case for all zones not having
>> Demand Control Ventilation in the Proposed case. Please confirm that
>> minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled identically in the
>> Baseline and Proposed cases using the proposed case rates. Additionally,
>> please verify that all systems in both the baseline and proposed case are
>> modeled with zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet
>> unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate
>> an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the
>> unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline
>> and Proposed case).
>>
>> The situation becomes a bit more complicated in you have systems that
>> have demand controlled ventilation (often implemented as Carbon Dioxide
>> control of outdoor air or as programmed control of outdoor air based on
>> occupancy sensors.) In this case the Baseline case energy model must
>> include the minimum outdoor air as determined by the ASHRAE 62.1
>> Ventilation Rate Procedure calculations for all systems having demand
>> controlled ventilation.
>>
>> The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems
>> that do have demand controlled ventilation:
>>
>> Demand control ventilation was modeled for credit in the proposed case.
>> Appendix G allows schedule changes for demand control ventilation as
>> approved by the rating authority (Table G3.1#4(Baseline)). As the LEED
>> Certification rating authority, GBCI requires that the outside air
>> ventilation rates for the Baseline case be modeled using minimum ASHRAE
>> 62.1-2004 (or 2007 for LEED-NC 2009 projects) rates wherever credit is
>> taken for demand control ventilation in the Proposed case. The proposed
>> case minimum rates at design conditions should be modeled as designed.
>> Please verify that the Baseline Case model reflects ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or
>> 2007) minimum rates for any spaces where credit is taken for demand control
>> ventilation, or revise the model accordingly. For all other spaces, please
>> confirm that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled
>> identically in the Baseline and Proposed cases. Additionally, please verify
>> that all systems in both the baseline and proposed cases are modeled with
>> zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback
>> temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate
>> minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied
>> outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and
>> Proposed case).
>>
>> Finally, even though you don't address energy recovery in your question,
>> whether or not you have energy recovery in your ventilation systems may
>> affect how much better (or worse) your Proposed case energy models perform
>> in relation to your Baseline case energy models.
>>
>> The following generic LEED Review Comment addresses energy recovery in
>> EAc1 energy models as it relates to ventilation systems.
>>
>> Energy recovery is modeled for credit in the Proposed case. Please
>> provide further information regarding the energy recovery efficiency,
>> verify that outside air is modeled with zero flow in both the Baseline and
>> Proposed cases during unoccupied periods when fans are cycled on to meet
>> unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate
>> an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the
>> unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Low Ambient Strategy questioned in LEED Review
Message-ID: <assp.13027e780b.47813BD5DFF1D147997345A40A19343203F69210@GREEN.southface.org>

Sorry for the long attachment here, but this LEED v2.2 EAc1 comment has
me really confused so I want to post it in its entirety.

 

1.    The EAc1 Narrative describes the interior lighting design target
for all studio spaces is 20 fc and that task lights have been modeled
identically in the Baseline and Proposed case. However, according to the
IESNA Lighting Handbook, ninth edition, the minimum horizontal design
illuminance for art studios is 50 fc and for reading areas with
handwritten tasks is 30 fc. The ASHRAE allowances represent the power
allowance required to meet the minimum IESNA illuminance requirements
for various space types. It is inappropriate to claim savings for
designs that do not meet the minimum lighting level requirements and
model the additional lighting power in the Baseline for lighting in the
Proposed that is required to perform the anticipated tasks.

Also, Table 1.4 reports that 4.02 kW of process lighting has been
modeled in both cases, and it is assumed that this represents the task
lighting. Process lighting is limited to the exempt interior lighting
applications described in Section 9.2.2.3. Task lighting is regulated
and thus not considered a process load. Section 9.6.3(b) does provide an
additional allowance for task lighting when the Space by Space Method is
used, but this may not be used for lighting required to raise the
ambient lighting to meet the required lighting levels. If this
additional allowance is used in the Proposed design, the Baseline must
be modeled with the same power as the Proposed up to the 0.35 W/square
foot allowance. Please remove all task lighting power from the Baseline
model that is required to meet the IESNA recommended illuminance levels.
If any of the additional allowance from Section 9.2.2.3 is applied to
the Baseline case, provide calculations verifying that this additional
lighting is not required in the Proposed case to meet the required
illuminance levels and confirming that this only represents the portion
of the additional allowance that is used in the Proposed case.



My first question; isn't low ambient-task specific a commonly accepted
energy use reduction strategy? Why would I model a lighting design in
the proposed solution which isn't installed and how would one determine,
without an extensive lighting design effort, the appropriate lighting
power to achieve 50fc, or 30fc? (not quite sure which one they want) 

Second, the spaces in question are architecture college studios. If the
task lighting is a plug in desk lamp, provided by the student, then am I
correct in assuming it's not regulated by 9.2.2.3? I've assumed 60W per
lamp as plug load, but there no way that the lamp type or light
distribution can be controlled as defined in 9.6.3.b, nor is it a given
that a lamp will be used. 

 

I'm at a loss as to how to respond to this. 

 

Thanks for any input.

tb,

After, you have read through this  couple of times, or looked at it in 
an Excel table, you will figure out the changes you have to make and 
make them. Always remember, do the proposed case first and then back out 
the baseline, which must meet the applicable code.

I think in a case like this building you would have had a different 
result if you had attached, or put into the form, what you were trying 
to do and how you did it. Your explanation is quite good and it gives 
the reviewers something to look at besides numbers. Then you get to 
exercise both sides of your brain.

Cheers,

Carol

Has anyone used COMIS, CONTAM and Energy Programs to evaluate infiltration, exfiltration, ventilation due to stack and wind effect in tall and super tall buildings? Can you get these values for any height (floor) of the building? I would also like to get information on research (published papers) on this topic.
 
I would like to have similar information on double wall commercial buildings and a list of such buildings. There are two in the US that I know of, one in Buffalo NY and other is Manulife Boston http://www.som.com/content.cfm/601_congress_street
 
Hey Arpan,
This paper from CU Boulder (http://rp.ashrae.biz/page/ASHRAE-D-RP-1456-20110405.pdf) compares several bulk airflow models (COMIS, CONTAM, EnergyPlus, ESP-r) with lab experiments. They examine wind-driven, bouyancy-driven and combined-driven flows. There's a long list of references at the end too.

Tom et al:

 

To your reviewer's first paragraph... this is something of a tangent for
your quandary, but it sometimes infuriates me how many in our industry
try to apply/enforce/design around the recommended illuminance level
tables without reading the (short!) chapter discussing what they mean
and how they're intended to be used and not used.  They are emphatically
NOT "minimums."  I have been cornered on this a few times by select
individuals outside of a LEED review - suffice to say reviewers who
don't learn what they're enforcing run the risk of demonstrating their
incompetence.

 

It appears: (1) your reviewer does not understand task-ambient lighting
and could use some education in that dept and (2) you have not
communicated exactly what that 20fc figure means.  Your reviewer has the
impression task surfaces will only have 20fc after all sources (which
would be bad lighting for an architecture studio).  Correct that
impression, and further explain how the targeted illuminance values are
going to be achieved.

 

"Installed interior lighting power" is a 90.1 glossary term.  For
90.1-2004/2007, it only includes "permanently installed" fixtures*.
Reviewer is having a quibble over vocabulary... If I'm not mistaken,
desk lamps are plug loads, and plug loads are process loads.  Simple.
Perhaps different terminology is part of any revisions you may need to
make.   I think the term "process lighting" is something your reviewer
may be making up, but he/she is referring to lighting integral to
refrigerator casework and such in that long list of exceptions... you
should not need to "exempt" desk lamps because they're not permanently
installed and so inherently are not part of "installed interior lighting
power" to begin with. 

 

9.6.3(b) is for VDT's (computer screens) - sorta confusing reference...
Does anyone know if there is precedent for this?  The function of this
passage as I understand it is to permit additional lighting beyond the
interior lighting power allowance under the space-by-space method... not
to limit task lighting within the allowance.  Again, I think the term
"task-ambient" is throwing your reviewer off.

 

I have not attempted documenting this myself, but am not aware of
anything in 90.1 or the IESNA Handbook that disallows the use of
non-permanently installed lighting (however variable it may be in a
college setting) to achieve the targeted illuminance values.  This may
warrant some investigation however to be sure.  

 

~Nick

1.    The EAc1 Narrative describes the interior lighting design target
for all studio spaces is 20 fc and that task lights have been modeled
identically in the Baseline and Proposed case. However, according to the
IESNA Lighting Handbook, ninth edition, the minimum horizontal design
illuminance for art studios is 50 fc and for reading areas with
handwritten tasks is 30 fc. The ASHRAE allowances represent the power
allowance required to meet the minimum IESNA illuminance requirements
for various space types. It is inappropriate to claim savings for
designs that do not meet the minimum lighting level requirements and
model the additional lighting power in the Baseline for lighting in the
Proposed that is required to perform the anticipated tasks.

Also, Table 1.4 reports that 4.02 kW of process lighting has been
modeled in both cases, and it is assumed that this represents the task
lighting. Process lighting is limited to the exempt interior lighting
applications described in Section 9.2.2.3. Task lighting is regulated
and thus not considered a process load. Section 9.6.3(b) does provide an
additional allowance for task lighting when the Space by Space Method is
used, but this may not be used for lighting required to raise the
ambient lighting to meet the required lighting levels. If this
additional allowance is used in the Proposed design, the Baseline must
be modeled with the same power as the Proposed up to the 0.35 W/square
foot allowance. Please remove all task lighting power from the Baseline
model that is required to meet the IESNA recommended illuminance levels.
If any of the additional allowance from Section 9.2.2.3 is applied to
the Baseline case, provide calculations verifying that this additional
lighting is not required in the Proposed case to meet the required
illuminance levels and confirming that this only represents the portion
of the additional allowance that is used in the Proposed case.




My first question; isn't low ambient-task specific a commonly accepted
energy use reduction strategy? Why would I model a lighting design in
the proposed solution which isn't installed and how would one determine,
without an extensive lighting design effort, the appropriate lighting
power to achieve 50fc, or 30fc? (not quite sure which one they want) 

Second, the spaces in question are architecture college studios. If the
task lighting is a plug in desk lamp, provided by the student, then am I
correct in assuming it's not regulated by 9.2.2.3? I've assumed 60W per
lamp as plug load, but there no way that the lamp type or light
distribution can be controlled as defined in 9.6.3.b, nor is it a given
that a lamp will be used. 

 

I'm at a loss as to how to respond to this. 

 

Thanks for any input.

I suggest you contact GBCI thru:

 

http://www.gbci.org/contactcertification.aspx

 

I had an issue a few months ago where I believed the reviewer was
incorrect in their comment, and Gail Hampshire (Technical Director of
the HVAC/Energy team) was very helpful in resolving the issue and making
other reviewers aware of it.  She said the above contact method is best
to make sure your question gets properly addressed for your project now,
and for future projects.

 

I agree with Nick - this review comment is at least partially incorrect,
in that you can't negate an ECM that the design engineer has implemented
just because the result may not comply with an IESNA "guideline".  That
would be like saying that an improved exterior lighting design is not
allowed because the resulting footcandle levels don't comply with a
random GSA requirement, or something to that affect.

Tom et al:

 

To your reviewer's first paragraph... this is something of a tangent for
your quandary, but it sometimes infuriates me how many in our industry
try to apply/enforce/design around the recommended illuminance level
tables without reading the (short!) chapter discussing what they mean
and how they're intended to be used and not used.  They are emphatically
NOT "minimums."  I have been cornered on this a few times by select
individuals outside of a LEED review - suffice to say reviewers who
don't learn what they're enforcing run the risk of demonstrating their
incompetence.

 

It appears: (1) your reviewer does not understand task-ambient lighting
and could use some education in that dept and (2) you have not
communicated exactly what that 20fc figure means.  Your reviewer has the
impression task surfaces will only have 20fc after all sources (which
would be bad lighting for an architecture studio).  Correct that
impression, and further explain how the targeted illuminance values are
going to be achieved.

 

"Installed interior lighting power" is a 90.1 glossary term.  For
90.1-2004/2007, it only includes "permanently installed" fixtures*.
Reviewer is having a quibble over vocabulary... If I'm not mistaken,
desk lamps are plug loads, and plug loads are process loads.  Simple.
Perhaps different terminology is part of any revisions you may need to
make.   I think the term "process lighting" is something your reviewer
may be making up, but he/she is referring to lighting integral to
refrigerator casework and such in that long list of exceptions... you
should not need to "exempt" desk lamps because they're not permanently
installed and so inherently are not part of "installed interior lighting
power" to begin with. 

 

9.6.3(b) is for VDT's (computer screens) - sorta confusing reference...
Does anyone know if there is precedent for this?  The function of this
passage as I understand it is to permit additional lighting beyond the
interior lighting power allowance under the space-by-space method... not
to limit task lighting within the allowance.  Again, I think the term
"task-ambient" is throwing your reviewer off.

 

I have not attempted documenting this myself, but am not aware of
anything in 90.1 or the IESNA Handbook that disallows the use of
non-permanently installed lighting (however variable it may be in a
college setting) to achieve the targeted illuminance values.  This may
warrant some investigation however to be sure.

tb,

After, you have read through this  couple of times, or looked at it in
an Excel table, you will figure out the changes you have to make and
make them. Always remember, do the proposed case first and then back out
the baseline, which must meet the applicable code. 

I think in a case like this building you would have had a different
result if you had attached, or put into the form, what you were trying
to do and how you did it. Your explanation is quite good and it gives
the reviewers something to look at besides numbers. Then you get to
exercise both sides of your brain.

Cheers,

Carol

Sorry for the long attachment here, but this LEED v2.2 EAc1 comment has
me really confused so I want to post it in its entirety.

 

1.    The EAc1 Narrative describes the interior lighting design target
for all studio spaces is 20 fc and that task lights have been modeled
identically in the Baseline and Proposed case. However, according to the
IESNA Lighting Handbook, ninth edition, the minimum horizontal design
illuminance for art studios is 50 fc and for reading areas with
handwritten tasks is 30 fc. The ASHRAE allowances represent the power
allowance required to meet the minimum IESNA illuminance requirements
for various space types. It is inappropriate to claim savings for
designs that do not meet the minimum lighting level requirements and
model the additional lighting power in the Baseline for lighting in the
Proposed that is required to perform the anticipated tasks.

Also, Table 1.4 reports that 4.02 kW of process lighting has been
modeled in both cases, and it is assumed that this represents the task
lighting. Process lighting is limited to the exempt interior lighting
applications described in Section 9.2.2.3. Task lighting is regulated
and thus not considered a process load. Section 9.6.3(b) does provide an
additional allowance for task lighting when the Space by Space Method is
used, but this may not be used for lighting required to raise the
ambient lighting to meet the required lighting levels. If this
additional allowance is used in the Proposed design, the Baseline must
be modeled with the same power as the Proposed up to the 0.35 W/square
foot allowance. Please remove all task lighting power from the Baseline
model that is required to meet the IESNA recommended illuminance levels.
If any of the additional allowance from Section 9.2.2.3 is applied to
the Baseline case, provide calculations verifying that this additional
lighting is not required in the Proposed case to meet the required
illuminance levels and confirming that this only represents the portion
of the additional allowance that is used in the Proposed case.



My first question; isn't low ambient-task specific a commonly accepted
energy use reduction strategy? Why would I model a lighting design in

Nick,

I mostly agree with your approach, however I disagree on one point - even
though desk lamps may be plugged-in and not permanently installed, if they
are part of the overall lighting plan, then I think that they should be
included in the proposed model and not in the baseline.  If you have low
footcandles in a space, but for whaterver reason, task lighting is not
required (this architectural studio uses giant multi-touch computers for
drawing), then task lights should be modeled equally in both models.

I'll play devil's advocate here.

 

If the reviewer's interpretation of the baseline model is correct, the
maximum LPD values have been entered for the baseline per Table 9.6.1
(or maybe Table 9.5.1). Additionally, 4.02 kW of lighting has been added
to both the baseline and proposed models to represent task lighting via
plug-in desk lamps. I agree with the reviewer that plug-in desk lamps
are not process loads as they don't meet any of the 9.2.2.3 exceptions.
Presumably, installed lighting fixtures provide 20 fc in the studio
spaces and students will turn on desk lamps to increase the light level
to something in the range of 50 fc +/-. Therefore, the proposed model
would be claiming savings unfairly if the desk lamp power is added to
the baseline in addition to the Table 9.6.1 values. I'm not aware of a
LEED or ASHRAE 90.1 requirement that a proposed design must have a
lighting design that "satisfies" IESNA lighting guidelines. My guess is
that the reviewer is mentioning IESNA levels to support the position
that the desk lamp power needs to be removed from the baseline model. I
assume the reference to 9.6.3(b) is a typo and should be 9.6.2(b).

 

My approach would be to do the following:

1.)    Pester the lighting designer for their estimate of desk/task
lighting power sufficient to meet desired lighting levels.

2.)    Use that value in the proposed model in place of the 4.02 kW of
process lighting.

3.)    Create and apply a unique desk/task lighting schedule.

4.)    Remove the 4.02 kW load from the baseline.

5.)    Allot a portion of the baseline lighting allowance to desk/task
lighting (equal to the power calculated/assumed for the proposed design)
and assign it to the desk/task lighting schedule.

 

Alternatively, you could argue that your 4.02 kW value is reasonable and
leave it in the proposed model, but remove it from the baseline. The
worst alternative would be to follow the guidance in Appendix G Table
G3.1(6b) and "assume identical lighting power for the proposed and
baseline designs", since the architecture studios could be interpreted
to meet the exception of "other spaces in which lighting systems are
connected via receptacles and are not shown or provided for on building
plans".

 

It is also possible that I don't understand task-ambient lighting and
could use some education. ;)

Nick,

 

I mostly agree with your approach, however I disagree on one point -
even though desk lamps may be plugged-in and not permanently installed,
if they are part of the overall lighting plan, then I think that they
should be included in the proposed model and not in the baseline.  If
you have low footcandles in a space, but for whatever reason, task
lighting is not required (this architectural studio uses giant
multi-touch computers for drawing), then task lights should be modeled
equally in both models.

I suggest you contact GBCI thru:

 

http://www.gbci.org/contactcertification.aspx

 

I had an issue a few months ago where I believed the reviewer was
incorrect in their comment, and Gail Hampshire (Technical Director of
the HVAC/Energy team) was very helpful in resolving the issue and making
other reviewers aware of it.  She said the above contact method is best
to make sure your question gets properly addressed for your project now,
and for future projects.

 

I agree with Nick - this review comment is at least partially incorrect,
in that you can't negate an ECM that the design engineer has implemented
just because the result may not comply with an IESNA "guideline".  That
would be like saying that an improved exterior lighting design is not
allowed because the resulting footcandle levels don't comply with a
random GSA requirement, or something to that affect.

Tom et al:

 

To your reviewer's first paragraph... this is something of a tangent for
your quandary, but it sometimes infuriates me how many in our industry
try to apply/enforce/design around the recommended illuminance level
tables without reading the (short!) chapter discussing what they mean
and how they're intended to be used and not used.  They are emphatically
NOT "minimums."  I have been cornered on this a few times by select
individuals outside of a LEED review - suffice to say reviewers who
don't learn what they're enforcing run the risk of demonstrating their
incompetence.

 

It appears: (1) your reviewer does not understand task-ambient lighting
and could use some education in that dept and (2) you have not
communicated exactly what that 20fc figure means.  Your reviewer has the
impression task surfaces will only have 20fc after all sources (which
would be bad lighting for an architecture studio).  Correct that
impression, and further explain how the targeted illuminance values are
going to be achieved.

 

"Installed interior lighting power" is a 90.1 glossary term.  For
90.1-2004/2007, it only includes "permanently installed" fixtures*.
Reviewer is having a quibble over vocabulary... If I'm not mistaken,
desk lamps are plug loads, and plug loads are process loads.  Simple.
Perhaps different terminology is part of any revisions you may need to
make.   I think the term "process lighting" is something your reviewer
may be making up, but he/she is referring to lighting integral to
refrigerator casework and such in that long list of exceptions... you
should not need to "exempt" desk lamps because they're not permanently
installed and so inherently are not part of "installed interior lighting
power" to begin with. 

 

9.6.3(b) is for VDT's (computer screens) - sorta confusing reference...
Does anyone know if there is precedent for this?  The function of this
passage as I understand it is to permit additional lighting beyond the
interior lighting power allowance under the space-by-space method... not
to limit task lighting within the allowance.  Again, I think the term
"task-ambient" is throwing your reviewer off.

 

I have not attempted documenting this myself, but am not aware of
anything in 90.1 or the IESNA Handbook that disallows the use of
non-permanently installed lighting (however variable it may be in a
college setting) to achieve the targeted illuminance values.  This may
warrant some investigation however to be sure.

tb,

After, you have read through this  couple of times, or looked at it in
an Excel table, you will figure out the changes you have to make and
make them. Always remember, do the proposed case first and then back out
the baseline, which must meet the applicable code. 

I think in a case like this building you would have had a different
result if you had attached, or put into the form, what you were trying
to do and how you did it. Your explanation is quite good and it gives
the reviewers something to look at besides numbers. Then you get to
exercise both sides of your brain.

Cheers,

Sorry for the long attachment here, but this LEED v2.2 EAc1 comment has
me really confused so I want to post it in its entirety.

 

1.    The EAc1 Narrative describes the interior lighting design target
for all studio spaces is 20 fc and that task lights have been modeled
identically in the Baseline and Proposed case. However, according to the
IESNA Lighting Handbook, ninth edition, the minimum horizontal design
illuminance for art studios is 50 fc and for reading areas with
handwritten tasks is 30 fc. The ASHRAE allowances represent the power
allowance required to meet the minimum IESNA illuminance requirements
for various space types. It is inappropriate to claim savings for
designs that do not meet the minimum lighting level requirements and
model the additional lighting power in the Baseline for lighting in the
Proposed that is required to perform the anticipated tasks.

Also, Table 1.4 reports that 4.02 kW of process lighting has been
modeled in both cases, and it is assumed that this represents the task
lighting. Process lighting is limited to the exempt interior lighting
applications described in Section 9.2.2.3. Task lighting is regulated
and thus not considered a process load. Section 9.6.3(b) does provide an
additional allowance for task lighting when the Space by Space Method is
used, but this may not be used for lighting required to raise the
ambient lighting to meet the required lighting levels. If this
additional allowance is used in the Proposed design, the Baseline must
be modeled with the same power as the Proposed up to the 0.35 W/square
foot allowance. Please remove all task lighting power from the Baseline
model that is required to meet the IESNA recommended illuminance levels.
If any of the additional allowance from Section 9.2.2.3 is applied to
the Baseline case, provide calculations verifying that this additional
lighting is not required in the Proposed case to meet the required
illuminance levels and confirming that this only represents the portion
of the additional allowance that is used in the Proposed case.

My first question; isn't low ambient-task specific a commonly accepted
energy use reduction strategy? Why would I model a lighting design in
the proposed solution which isn't installed and how would one determine,
without an extensive lighting design effort, the appropriate lighting
power to achieve 50fc, or 30fc? (not quite sure which one they want) 

Second, the spaces in question are architecture college studios. If the
task lighting is a plug in desk lamp, provided by the student, then am I
correct in assuming it's not regulated by 9.2.2.3? I've assumed 60W per
lamp as plug load, but there no way that the lamp type or light
distribution can be controlled as defined in 9.6.3.b, nor is it a given
that a lamp will be used. 

 

I'm at a loss as to how to respond to this. 

 

Thanks for any input.

Karen,

 

I agree completely, for what it's worth!  

 

In my response (pasted below for continuity), I wasn't thinking
specifically about how this gets applied in baseline vs. proposed, but
focusing on other issues within the comment.  I think making a
distinction between "plug loads that are an integral part of the
lighting system" and otherwise makes sense (desk lamps could fall in
either category).  Better to not call these process loads at all, to
avoid confusion. 

 

My master's thesis/research was focused on exploring/evaluating
task-ambient lighting strategies and their effects on occupants
comfort/productivity, so it's an issue I'm intimate with as a lighting
designer =).

 

Thanks!


~Nick

or light distribution can be controlled as defined in 9.6.3.b, nor is it
a given that a lamp will be used.

Message-ID: <CAEACE4E.5D543%chris@greenengineer.com>

Here's the logic in 90.1 Appendix G:

1. In 90.1 Appendix G, all lighting, including "task and furniture mounted
fixtures" must be included in the proposed case. (Table G3.1.6.d).

2. Table G3.1.6.b says that lighting power shall be determined in accordance
with Sections 9.1.3 and 9.1.4.

3. Section 9.1.3 says that all lighting power must be included "except as
specifically exempted in 9.2.2.3."

3. In 90.1 there is no such thing as "process lighting". If the lighting
doesn't meet one of the exceptions in 9.2.2.3 it must be included in the
model. 

4.  Note that 9.2.2.3.p applies, so furniture mounted task lighting with
automatic shutoff complying with 9.4.1.4(d) does NOT need to be included in
the model, provide it can be shown that it is "in addition to the general
lighting" 

I think the reviewer basically pointing out your circular logic. You've
argued that 20fc is adequate, but then argued that additional lighting
shouldn't be counted against you, because you need more light.

Subject:  Re: [Bldg-sim] Low Ambient Strategy questioned in LEED Review

I?ll play devil?s advocate here.
 
If the reviewer?s interpretation of the baseline model is correct, the
maximum LPD values have been entered for the baseline per Table 9.6.1 (or
maybe Table 9.5.1). Additionally, 4.02 kW of lighting has been added to both
the baseline and proposed models to represent task lighting via plug-in desk
lamps. I agree with the reviewer that plug-in desk lamps are not process
loads as they don?t meet any of the 9.2.2.3 exceptions. Presumably,
installed lighting fixtures provide 20 fc in the studio spaces and students
will turn on desk lamps to increase the light level to something in the
range of 50 fc +/-. Therefore, the proposed model would be claiming savings
unfairly if the desk lamp power is added to the baseline in addition to the
Table 9.6.1 values. I?m not aware of a LEED or ASHRAE 90.1 requirement that
a proposed design must have a lighting design that ?satisfies? IESNA
lighting guidelines. My guess is that the reviewer is mentioning IESNA
levels to support the position that the desk lamp power needs to be removed
from the baseline model. I assume the reference to 9.6.3(b) is a typo and
should be 9.6.2(b).
 
My approach would be to do the following:
1.)    Pester the lighting designer for their estimate of desk/task lighting
power sufficient to meet desired lighting levels.

2.)    Use that value in the proposed model in place of the 4.02 kW of
process lighting.

3.)    Create and apply a unique desk/task lighting schedule.

4.)    Remove the 4.02 kW load from the baseline.

5.)    Allot a portion of the baseline lighting allowance to desk/task
lighting (equal to the power calculated/assumed for the proposed design) and
assign it to the desk/task lighting schedule.

 
Alternatively, you could argue that your 4.02 kW value is reasonable and
leave it in the proposed model, but remove it from the baseline. The worst
alternative would be to follow the guidance in Appendix G Table G3.1(6b) and
?assume identical lighting power for the proposed and baseline designs?,
since the architecture studios could be interpreted to meet the exception of
?other spaces in which lighting systems are connected via receptacles and
are not shown or provided for on building plans?.
 
It is also possible that I don?t understand task-ambient lighting and could
use some education. ;)

Bill

Nick,
 
I mostly agree with your approach, however I disagree on one point - even
though desk lamps may be plugged-in and not permanently installed, if they
are part of the overall lighting plan, then I think that they should be
included in the proposed model and not in the baseline.  If you have low
footcandles in a space, but for whatever reason, task lighting is not
required (this architectural studio uses giant multi-touch computers for
drawing), then task lights should be modeled equally in both models.

I suggest you contact GBCI thru:
 
http://www.gbci.org/contactcertification.aspx
 
I had an issue a few months ago where I believed the reviewer was incorrect
in their comment, and Gail Hampshire (Technical Director of the HVAC/Energy
team) was very helpful in resolving the issue and making other reviewers
aware of it.  She said the above contact method is best to make sure your
question gets properly addressed for your project now, and for future
projects.
 
I agree with Nick - this review comment is at least partially incorrect, in
that you can't negate an ECM that the design engineer has implemented just
because the result may not comply with an IESNA "guideline".  That would be
like saying that an improved exterior lighting design is not allowed because
the resulting footcandle levels don't comply with a random GSA requirement,
or something to that affect.

Tom et al:
 
To your reviewer?s first paragraph? this is something of a tangent for your
quandary, but it sometimes infuriates me how many in our industry try to
apply/enforce/design around the recommended illuminance level tables without
reading the (short!) chapter discussing what they mean and how they?re
intended to be used and not used.  They are emphatically NOT ?minimums.?  I
have been cornered on this a few times by select individuals outside of a
LEED review ? suffice to say reviewers who don?t learn what they?re
enforcing run the risk of demonstrating their incompetence.
 
It appears: (1) your reviewer does not understand task-ambient lighting and
could use some education in that dept and (2) you have not communicated
exactly what that 20fc figure means.  Your reviewer has the impression task
surfaces will only have 20fc after all sources (which would be bad lighting
for an architecture studio).  Correct that impression, and further explain
how the targeted illuminance values are going to be achieved.
 
?Installed interior lighting power? is a 90.1 glossary term.  For
90.1-2004/2007, it only includes ?permanently installed? fixtures*.
Reviewer is having a quibble over vocabulary... If I?m not mistaken, desk
lamps are plug loads, and plug loads are process loads.  Simple.  Perhaps
different terminology is part of any revisions you may need to make.   I
think the term ?process lighting? is something your reviewer may be making
up, but he/she is referring to lighting integral to refrigerator casework
and such in that long list of exceptions? you should not need to ?exempt?
desk lamps because they?re not permanently installed and so inherently are
not part of ?installed interior lighting power? to begin with.
 
9.6.3(b) is for VDT?s (computer screens) ? sorta confusing reference... Does
anyone know if there is precedent for this?  The function of this passage as
I understand it is to permit additional lighting beyond the interior
lighting power allowance under the space-by-space method? not to limit task
lighting within the allowance.  Again, I think the term ?task-ambient? is
throwing your reviewer off.
 
I have not attempted documenting this myself, but am not aware of anything
in 90.1 or the IESNA Handbook that disallows the use of non-permanently
installed lighting (however variable it may be in a college setting) to
achieve the targeted illuminance values.  This may warrant some
investigation however to be sure.

tb,

After, you have read through this  couple of times, or looked at it in an
Excel table, you will figure out the changes you have to make and make them.
Always remember, do the proposed case first and then back out the baseline,
which must meet the applicable code.

I think in a case like this building you would have had a different result
if you had attached, or put into the form, what you were trying to do and
how you did it. Your explanation is quite good and it gives the reviewers
something to look at besides numbers. Then you get to exercise both sides of
your brain.

Cheers,

Carol

Sorry for the long attachment here, but this LEED v2.2 EAc1 comment has me
really confused so I want to post it in its entirety.
 
1.    The EAc1 Narrative describes the interior lighting design target for
all studio spaces is 20 fc and that task lights have been modeled
identically in the Baseline and Proposed case. However, according to the
IESNA Lighting Handbook, ninth edition, the minimum horizontal design
illuminance for art studios is 50 fc and for reading areas with handwritten
tasks is 30 fc. The ASHRAE allowances represent the power allowance required
to meet the minimum IESNA illuminance requirements for various space types.
It is inappropriate to claim savings for designs that do not meet the
minimum lighting level requirements and model the additional lighting power
in the Baseline for lighting in the Proposed that is required to perform the
anticipated tasks.

Also, Table 1.4 reports that 4.02 kW of process lighting has been modeled in
both cases, and it is assumed that this represents the task lighting.
Process lighting is limited to the exempt interior lighting applications
described in Section 9.2.2.3. Task lighting is regulated and thus not
considered a process load. Section 9.6.3(b) does provide an additional
allowance for task lighting when the Space by Space Method is used, but this
may not be used for lighting required to raise the ambient lighting to meet
the required lighting levels. If this additional allowance is used in the
Proposed design, the Baseline must be modeled with the same power as the
Proposed up to the 0.35 W/square foot allowance. Please remove all task
lighting power from the Baseline model that is required to meet the IESNA
recommended illuminance levels. If any of the additional allowance from
Section 9.2.2.3 is applied to the Baseline case, provide calculations
verifying that this additional lighting is not required in the Proposed case
to meet the required illuminance levels and confirming that this only
represents the portion of the additional allowance that is used in the
Proposed case.

My first question; isn?t low ambient-task specific a commonly accepted
energy use reduction strategy? Why would I model a lighting design in the
proposed solution which isn?t installed and how would one determine, without
an extensive lighting design effort, the appropriate lighting power to
achieve 50fc, or 30fc? (not quite sure which one they want)
Second, the spaces in question are architecture college studios. If the task
lighting is a plug in desk lamp, provided by the student, then am I correct
in assuming it?s not regulated by 9.2.2.3? I?ve assumed 60W per lamp as plug
load, but there no way that the lamp type or light distribution can be
controlled as defined in 9.6.3.b, nor is it a given that a lamp will be
used. 
 
I?m at a loss as to how to respond to this.
 
Thanks for any input.

I would like to be grandfathered in please. Who is scrutinizing this
document (proposed regulation?) at ASHRAE headquarters? Have you had any
input from ASHRAE?

If you were to do a jta for President of the United States it might not be
so lengthy as the one for building energy modelers. (And, a lot of folks in
the current primary would be automatically excluded). Is it possible that
we have the cart before the horse? Perhaps we need a jta for building
architects and building design engineers of which energy modelers could be
a subset.  I am sure that if DOE proposed a regulatory test procedure for
architects and engineers there would be plenty of comment.

I've looked at the document. What caught my attentions was the list of
"skills and abilities." These included such thing as "time management
skills," "critical thinking," and  "spatial skills."  Assuming that the
goal is to define *measurable* skills, we might want to give energy modeler
want-a-be s the SAT again.

Then I saw "common sense" and "patience" as skills and abilities. Now, not
withstanding the jta, I consider myself a competent modeler of buildings
and their energy systems. We don't need to vote on that but I also am
reasonably sure that "patience" has only recently kicked in as a personal
skill (maybe I am being optimistic). How are we going to measure the
"common sense" of someone who wants to apply to be an energy modeler?

Dr. Roth, it is not clear that very many in the building sciences field are
aware of your project, its history, and potential impact. Perhaps you could
get on the agenda at an upcoming ASHRAE meeting and explain the process and
your intent for the project outcomes.

Respectfully,
Doug Hittle

Mr. Hittle,

My name is Daniel Studer and I am an engineer at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. I also happen to be the project lead for DOE's commercial job/task analysis development work.

I can assure you that we have conducted extensive outreach to ensure that persons who operate in the spaces targeted by these JTAs are fully aware of the work being performed, including ASHRAE.

The energy modeler JTA itself was created over the course of three days by eleven practicing energy modelers who were guided through the process by a professional psychometrician. The names and associated organizations of each of these folks are listed at the back of the JTA, in case you are curious. DOE and NREL had zero input into the content of this document. And to ensure that the document is truly reflective of the industry, DOE has decided to make the documents available for public comment. That way, individuals such as yourself can provide DOE with constructive feedback to ensure that the document content is both appropriate and valid.

The intent of the project, as stated on the project website, is to:
Provide a basis for developing and comparing new and existing training programs in the commercial building sector. This will help individuals identify opportunities to enhance their professional skills, enable industry to identify an appropriately skilled workforce, and allow training providers to ensure that they are providing the highest quality product possible.

In short, we are trying to document the job as it currently exists so that training/certification providers can ensure that they are providing high quality products in line with industry's identified needs. Additionally, gathering this information using the objective approach that we have also has the side benefit of creating a sort of baseline document that can be used to help a training/certification end user better understand how their current skill set and existing training/certification options fit together.

I totally agree with you that items identified such as "time management skills" are not very measurable, and in fact seem both excessive and irrelevant, in the context of developing a training program or certification around this material. However, such information is very valuable in other contexts, which is why it is included in any JTA which utilizes the "developing a curriculum" (DACUM) method. The idea is that all aspects of the job should be documented so that the resultant analysis can be used for multiple purposes. For example, an individual wishing to develop a job posting may look at the JTA and include items such as "time management skills" or "spatial skills" in the job posting. They could then structure interview questions to better understand that person's abilities in those areas to make a more informed decision about a candidate.

In other JTAs that were developed under this project, SMEs also identified physical attributes necessary to perform the job (e.g., lift X lbs over head, see X feet). While these may also seem silly, they become very important when developing high risk assessments, such as licensure exams, in these spaces.

The real meat of each document is the DACUM chart located at the back of each. These charts identify the specific domain areas, tasks, and steps that the SMEs identified were necessary to perform the specified job. It is this content specifically that is of most use to training/certification providers, which is why DOE asked for comments on this specific chart in the Federal Register notice.

The proposed content blueprint tables (located near the front of each document), contain the SME's proposed weights for how often, and how important, each of the identified tasks is to the job. Such weights provide valuable context to training/certification providers by serving as guidelines for how much time should be devoted to each topic.

As part of this project, NREL will be facilitating a "survey validation" which will provide industry with the opportunity to adjust these weighting factors. However, to avoid the confusion that would occur with two "comment periods" occurring at once, this will not happen until DOE's public comment closes at the end of November.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any additional questions.

Thanks,
Danny

I would like to be grandfathered in please. Who is scrutinizing this document (proposed regulation?) at ASHRAE headquarters? Have you had any input from ASHRAE?

If you were to do a jta for President of the United States it might not be so lengthy as the one for building energy modelers. (And, a lot of folks in the current primary would be automatically excluded). Is it possible that we have the cart before the horse? Perhaps we need a jta for building architects and building design engineers of which energy modelers could be a subset.  I am sure that if DOE proposed a regulatory test procedure for architects and engineers there would be plenty of comment.

I've looked at the document. What caught my attentions was the list of "skills and abilities." These included such thing as "time management skills," "critical thinking," and  "spatial skills."  Assuming that the goal is to define measurable skills, we might want to give energy modeler want-a-be s the SAT again.

Then I saw "common sense" and "patience" as skills and abilities. Now, not withstanding the jta, I consider myself a competent modeler of buildings and their energy systems. We don't need to vote on that but I also am reasonably sure that "patience" has only recently kicked in as a personal skill (maybe I am being optimistic). How are we going to measure the "common sense" of someone who wants to apply to be an energy modeler?

Dr. Roth, it is not clear that very many in the building sciences field are aware of your project, its history, and potential impact. Perhaps you could get on the agenda at an upcoming ASHRAE meeting and explain the process and your intent for the project outcomes.

Dear All,

I took a brief look a while back and was uncertain what the Job Task
analysis was trying to do; it seemed very broad and full of "soft skills"
like common sense and patience, as mentioned by Doug.  These are personal
attributes applicable to almost any job, any person and I was not sure what
they were doing in a job description.  Kendra clarified this a bit in her
post of yesterday, but I find myself thinking that I still don't really know
what I am evaluating or why. 

 

 

Kendra Tupper wrote earlier:

I am writing to encourage you participate in the public review of DOE's job
task analysis for energy modelers. Back in April, about 15 energy modeling
professionals (myself included) came up with this draft job description
(including required skills and knowledge) for energy modelers. This document
will provide the foundation for future education, training and certification
programs. It is likely that existing programs, such as the BEMP
certification, will need to show compliance with this.

 

For these reasons, I urge you to review and comment on this document! If you
think its sufficient and doesn't have gaps, that would also be helpful to
hear. The review period closes November 28, 2011.

Daniel, 

 

Thank you so much for this clarification!  I have to sympathize with Mr.
Hittle in that, despite the apparent efforts to "spread the word," I too
feel somewhat unsure of what the real implications will be for myself
and my colleagues in the energy modeling world.

 

My current impression is that the results of this study will ultimately
manifest as some sort of new licensure/certification/PDH requirements
for modeling services in future LEED and/or military/government
contracted work (i.e. DoD/GSA contracts)...  does that sound right?

 

Maybe an illustration would be helpful... This is from the comment
document:

 

"JTA is traditionally used by secondary and postsecondary educators,
test developers, and business, industry, government, and military
trainers to help identify core knowledge areas, critical work functions,
and skills that are common across a representative sampling of current
practitioners."

 

Can you provide an example of what JTA's have accomplished for those
working in the above industries?  

 

For better or for worse, my concern is this study is going to add
additional layers of beauracracy to the job description... Great news
(enforced business) for those in the licensing/training industries I
suppose, but will there be a net benefit for the actual practitioners?
Are my concerns unrealistic or missing the point?

 

Thanks again for your time and efforts!

 

~Nick

Mr. Hittle,

 

My name is Daniel Studer and I am an engineer at the National Renewable
Energy Laboratory. I also happen to be the project lead for DOE's
commercial job/task analysis development work.

 

I can assure you that we have conducted extensive outreach to ensure
that persons who operate in the spaces targeted by these JTAs are fully
aware of the work being performed, including ASHRAE.

 

The energy modeler JTA itself was created over the course of three days
by eleven practicing energy modelers who were guided through the process
by a professional psychometrician. The names and associated
organizations of each of these folks are listed at the back of the JTA,
in case you are curious. DOE and NREL had zero input into the content of
this document. And to ensure that the document is truly reflective of
the industry, DOE has decided to make the documents available for public
comment. That way, individuals such as yourself can provide DOE with
constructive feedback to ensure that the document content is both
appropriate and valid.

 

The intent of the project, as stated on the project website, is to:

Provide a basis for developing and comparing new and existing training
programs in the commercial building sector. This will help individuals
identify opportunities to enhance their professional skills, enable
industry to identify an appropriately skilled workforce, and allow
training providers to ensure that they are providing the highest quality
product possible.

 

In short, we are trying to document the job as it currently exists so
that training/certification providers can ensure that they are providing
high quality products in line with industry's identified needs.
Additionally, gathering this information using the objective approach
that we have also has the side benefit of creating a sort of baseline

better understand how their current skill set and existing
training/certification options fit together.

 

I totally agree with you that items identified such as "time management

irrelevant, in the context of developing a training program or
certification around this material. However, such information is very

They could then structure interview questions to better understand that
person's abilities in those areas to make a more informed decision about

Please feel free to contact me if you have any additional questions.

 

Thanks,

Danny

Nick,

Your concerns are entirely understandable, but perhaps a little overstated. The intention with this project was to produce documents that could be used by the corresponding sectors to improve existing, or if necessary, create new, training/certification materials, thus leading to a more qualified and effective workforce. If you take a look at the job categories we targeted, I think you will see that we focused on jobs that have a direct impact on commercial building energy use.

The development of specific training/certification materials however, is being left up to the training/certification providers in each industry. Our goal was to eliminate the heavy lift for such organizations by facilitating the identification (by industry, not by DOE or NREL) of what tasks were required in each job category, and what knowledge, skills, and abilities were required to perform each of those tasks. The idea is that organizations who have existing training/certification programs can self-compare their program to the developed JTA to determine if they are adequately meeting industry's needs. Or, for industries where few training/certification programs exist, organizations could use the developed JTAs to immediately start developing curricula (the DACUM method is often used to create curricula at the community college level). Through these mechanisms, the idea was to improve the quality and amount of training available to the end-user (in this case, the modeler), with the ultimate goal being a reduction in real energy use at the building level.

Additionally, the JTAs can be used as a standardized metric of sorts to evaluate existing training/certification programs. We are currently working on a tool that will allow an end-user in each of the six fields to examine what content different training/certification programs cover, using the JTAs as a baseline (so that folks are comparing apples to apples, instead of apples to oranges). That way, they can make a more informed decision about where to invest their time and money when pursuing professional development activities.

I do know that GSA is planning to utilize the JTAs to support efforts related to the Federal Buildings Personnel Training Act of 2010. What other items (new licensure/certification/PDH requirements for government/military contracted work, etc.) will come out of this work I cannot speak to, as those decisions are likely to be out of my control and should they arise, will likely be made within each corresponding organization, far from my purview.

I know this is another long response, and that I did not directly address several of your questions. However, I felt that clarifying the project purpose would actually eliminate the need for such answers. If you feel differently let me know and I'll try to go through and provide more specifics.

Thanks,
Danny

"JTA is traditionally used by secondary and postsecondary educators, test developers, and business, industry, government, and military trainers to help identify core knowledge areas, critical work functions, and skills that are common across a representative sampling of current practitioners."

Can you provide an example of what JTA's have accomplished for those working in the above industries?

For better or for worse, my concern is this study is going to add additional layers of beauracracy to the job description... Great news (enforced business) for those in the licensing/training industries I suppose, but will there be a net benefit for the actual practitioners?  Are my concerns unrealistic or missing the point?

Thanks again for your time and efforts!

Mr. Hittle,

My name is Daniel Studer and I am an engineer at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. I also happen to be the project lead for DOE's commercial job/task analysis development work.

I can assure you that we have conducted extensive outreach to ensure that persons who operate in the spaces targeted by these JTAs are fully aware of the work being performed, including ASHRAE.

The energy modeler JTA itself was created over the course of three days by eleven practicing energy modelers who were guided through the process by a professional psychometrician. The names and associated organizations of each of these folks are listed at the back of the JTA, in case you are curious. DOE and NREL had zero input into the content of this document. And to ensure that the document is truly reflective of the industry, DOE has decided to make the documents available for public comment. That way, individuals such as yourself can provide DOE with constructive feedback to ensure that the document content is both appropriate and valid.

The intent of the project, as stated on the project website, is to:
Provide a basis for developing and comparing new and existing training programs in the commercial building sector. This will help individuals identify opportunities to enhance their professional skills, enable industry to identify an appropriately skilled workforce, and allow training providers to ensure that they are providing the highest quality product possible.

In short, we are trying to document the job as it currently exists so that training/certification providers can ensure that they are providing high quality products in line with industry's identified needs. Additionally, gathering this information using the objective approach that we have also has the side benefit of creating a sort of baseline document that can be used to help a training/certification end user better understand how their current skill set and existing training/certification options fit together.

I totally agree with you that items identified such as "time management skills" are not very measurable, and in fact seem both excessive and irrelevant, in the context of developing a training program or certification around this material. However, such information is very valuable in other contexts, which is why it is included in any JTA which utilizes the "developing a curriculum" (DACUM) method. The idea is that all aspects of the job should be documented so that the resultant analysis can be used for multiple purposes. For example, an individual wishing to develop a job posting may look at the JTA and include items such as "time management skills" or "spatial skills" in the job posting. They could then structure interview questions to better understand that person's abilities in those areas to make a more informed decision about a candidate.

In other JTAs that were developed under this project, SMEs also identified physical attributes necessary to perform the job (e.g., lift X lbs over head, see X feet). While these may also seem silly, they become very important when developing high risk assessments, such as licensure exams, in these spaces.

The real meat of each document is the DACUM chart located at the back of each. These charts identify the specific domain areas, tasks, and steps that the SMEs identified were necessary to perform the specified job. It is this content specifically that is of most use to training/certification providers, which is why DOE asked for comments on this specific chart in the Federal Register notice.

The proposed content blueprint tables (located near the front of each document), contain the SME's proposed weights for how often, and how important, each of the identified tasks is to the job. Such weights provide valuable context to training/certification providers by serving as guidelines for how much time should be devoted to each topic.

As part of this project, NREL will be facilitating a "survey validation" which will provide industry with the opportunity to adjust these weighting factors. However, to avoid the confusion that would occur with two "comment periods" occurring at once, this will not happen until DOE's public comment closes at the end of November.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any additional questions.

Thanks,
Danny

I would like to be grandfathered in please. Who is scrutinizing this document (proposed regulation?) at ASHRAE headquarters? Have you had any input from ASHRAE?

If you were to do a jta for President of the United States it might not be so lengthy as the one for building energy modelers. (And, a lot of folks in the current primary would be automatically excluded). Is it possible that we have the cart before the horse? Perhaps we need a jta for building architects and building design engineers of which energy modelers could be a subset.  I am sure that if DOE proposed a regulatory test procedure for architects and engineers there would be plenty of comment.

I've looked at the document. What caught my attentions was the list of "skills and abilities." These included such thing as "time management skills," "critical thinking," and  "spatial skills."  Assuming that the goal is to define measurable skills, we might want to give energy modeler want-a-be s the SAT again.

Then I saw "common sense" and "patience" as skills and abilities. Now, not withstanding the jta, I consider myself a competent modeler of buildings and their energy systems. We don't need to vote on that but I also am reasonably sure that "patience" has only recently kicked in as a personal skill (maybe I am being optimistic). How are we going to measure the "common sense" of someone who wants to apply to be an energy modeler?

Dr. Roth, it is not clear that very many in the building sciences field are aware of your project, its history, and potential impact. Perhaps you could get on the agenda at an upcoming ASHRAE meeting and explain the process and your intent for the project outcomes.

Respectfully,
Doug Hittle

I'm afraid I can't agree that you conducted "extensive outreach" to prepare this document. For example, there was no discussion of this, before it happened, on any of the list servers before it came out. In addition, there was no "call for experts" that I was aware of. Normally, for a document like this that is sponsored by DOE, one would expect a call of some sort through the usual list servers.



In addition, I noticed from your list, that there is nobody who directly represents IBPSA-USA, nor even ASHRAE TC 4.7, which is the responsible ASHRAE TC for energy modeling. Although there are several individuals on the list who attend IBPSA and ASHRAE meetings and are well-known. It seems like little was done to notify others in IBPSA-USA or ASHRAE.



You should know that IBPSA-USA has also worked for some time on such an effort, which now exists as a wiki, under Joe Deringer's guidance. It also held a workshop in Boulder, and developed the BEM exam with ASHRAE. Yet, I see no reference to this or any of the previous efforts, nor efforts made to contact those of us who worked on this.



Finally, there are also at least a dozen or more educators within IBPSA-USA who teach Energy Modeling at the University level, yet not one of these individuals is mentioned in your list of contributors, only one academic appears on your list.



Hence, I suggest that if DOE is serious about making this a consensus document, then it needs to do a better job contacting the relevant organizations to obtain input and not rely on an email response after the fact.



Clearly, this is not the case with this document.

Opportunity Announcement

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is currently
sponsoring a project to develop (1) job task analyses (JTAs), which
identify and catalog all of the activities a worker performs in a
given job; and (2) the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs), which
define the minimum requirements necessary for a person to adequately
perform those tasks, for the following six commercial building job
categories:

- Energy modeler
- Operating engineer/building technician
- Building energy auditor
- Energy/sustainability manager
- Commissioning/retro-
commissioning practitioner
- Facility manager

The project goal is to create "national guidelines" which will define
a common body of knowledge that any training organization will be able
to draw from when developing curriculum, helping to bring the core
competencies imparted by training organizations to their trainees into
common alignment. This body of knowledge will also be used by the
General Services Administration and the Department of Energy to help
meet the requirements of the Federal Buildings Personnel Training Act
of 2010.

To facilitate development of the JTAs/KSAs, Professional Testing,
Inc. is seeking current industry practitioners who are interested in
helping to define, promote energy efficiency in, and support their
field of practice by participating in these JTA/KSA development
workshops. Interested individuals are invited to submit their
credentials at http://proftesting.rapidinsites.com. Please note that
each JTA/KSA workshop will take place in Denver, Colorado and is
anticipated to last 3 full days (not including travel). Reimbursement
for travel costs up to a fixed amount and a travel per diem will be
awarded to individuals selected for participation. Additional project
details, including how practitioners will be selected and where to
direct project-related questions, can be found using the above link.

NREL and Professional Testing, Inc. are excited to present this unique
opportunity for individuals to have their voices heard in this
important discussion. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
The NREL Commercial Workforce Development Team

Great Conversation, I really appreciate all of the feedback. 

 

I think the issue touches on what Nick alludes to in the confusion
between process and lighting load. I can make the argument that for
architectural education studios, the task light is a needed tool for the
act of hand drawing and model making, much like mass spectrometer is
required for some science experiments. No matter what light level is in
the space students will have a task lamp at their desk and will use to
set the light level to meet their specific needs. The reason to make it
distinct from the space lighting is that you don't always need it to be
on.

I believe I took a fair approach for modeling a load that the design
team has no control over by assigning 60w to the 67 workstations in the
project. I'll take some offense to the circular logic comment, in that
the conscious decision to provide lower ambient lighting levels than
typically recommended was in response to the fact that much of the
"drawing" is now encouraged to be done on the computer. An evenly lit
space at 20fc is actually quite nice for that task, so the issue isn't
that we didn't provide enough light, it's that we tailored the design to
the dominant condition, not the worst case, and are allowing the student
to fill in any gap for their particular task.        

 

Taking all of the great input into consideration I feel I will respond
by not altering the proposed design and removing the task lights from
the baseline.

 

Thanks all.

Here's the logic in 90.1 Appendix G:

 

1. In 90.1 Appendix G, all lighting, including "task and furniture
mounted fixtures" must be included in the proposed case. (Table
G3.1.6.d). 

 

2. Table G3.1.6.b says that lighting power shall be determined in
accordance with Sections 9.1.3 and 9.1.4. 

 

3. Section 9.1.3 says that all lighting power must be included "except
as specifically exempted in 9.2.2.3." 

 

3. In 90.1 there is no such thing as "process lighting". If the lighting
doesn't meet one of the exceptions in 9.2.2.3 it must be included in the
model. 

 

4.  Note that 9.2.2.3.p applies, so furniture mounted task lighting with
automatic shutoff complying with 9.4.1.4(d) does NOT need to be included
in the model, provide it can be shown that it is "in addition to the
general lighting" 

 

I think the reviewer basically pointing out your circular logic. You've
argued that 20fc is adequate, but then argued that additional lighting
shouldn't be counted against you, because you need more light.

I'll play devil's advocate here.

 

If the reviewer's interpretation of the baseline model is correct, the
maximum LPD values have been entered for the baseline per Table 9.6.1
(or maybe Table 9.5.1). Additionally, 4.02 kW of lighting has been added
to both the baseline and proposed models to represent task lighting via
plug-in desk lamps. I agree with the reviewer that plug-in desk lamps
are not process loads as they don't meet any of the 9.2.2.3 exceptions.
Presumably, installed lighting fixtures provide 20 fc in the studio
spaces and students will turn on desk lamps to increase the light level
to something in the range of 50 fc +/-. Therefore, the proposed model
would be claiming savings unfairly if the desk lamp power is added to
the baseline in addition to the Table 9.6.1 values. I'm not aware of a
LEED or ASHRAE 90.1 requirement that a proposed design must have a
lighting design that "satisfies" IESNA lighting guidelines. My guess is
that the reviewer is mentioning IESNA levels to support the position
that the desk lamp power needs to be removed from the baseline model. I
assume the reference to 9.6.3(b) is a typo and should be 9.6.2(b).

 

My approach would be to do the following:

1.)    Pester the lighting designer for their estimate of desk/task
lighting power sufficient to meet desired lighting levels.

2.)    Use that value in the proposed model in place of the 4.02 kW of
process lighting.

3.)    Create and apply a unique desk/task lighting schedule.

4.)    Remove the 4.02 kW load from the baseline.

5.)    Allot a portion of the baseline lighting allowance to desk/task
lighting (equal to the power calculated/assumed for the proposed design)
and assign it to the desk/task lighting schedule.

 

Alternatively, you could argue that your 4.02 kW value is reasonable and
leave it in the proposed model, but remove it from the baseline. The
worst alternative would be to follow the guidance in Appendix G Table
G3.1(6b) and "assume identical lighting power for the proposed and
baseline designs", since the architecture studios could be interpreted
to meet the exception of "other spaces in which lighting systems are
connected via receptacles and are not shown or provided for on building
plans".

 

It is also possible that I don't understand task-ambient lighting and
could use some education. ;)

Bill

Nick,

 

I mostly agree with your approach, however I disagree on one point -
even though desk lamps may be plugged-in and not permanently installed,
if they are part of the overall lighting plan, then I think that they
should be included in the proposed model and not in the baseline.  If
you have low footcandles in a space, but for whatever reason, task
lighting is not required (this architectural studio uses giant
multi-touch computers for drawing), then task lights should be modeled
equally in both models.

I suggest you contact GBCI thru:

 

http://www.gbci.org/contactcertification.aspx

 

I had an issue a few months ago where I believed the reviewer was
incorrect in their comment, and Gail Hampshire (Technical Director of
the HVAC/Energy team) was very helpful in resolving the issue and making
other reviewers aware of it.  She said the above contact method is best
to make sure your question gets properly addressed for your project now,
and for future projects.

 

I agree with Nick - this review comment is at least partially incorrect,
in that you can't negate an ECM that the design engineer has implemented
just because the result may not comply with an IESNA "guideline".  That
would be like saying that an improved exterior lighting design is not
allowed because the resulting footcandle levels don't comply with a
random GSA requirement, or something to that affect.

Tom et al:

 

To your reviewer's first paragraph... this is something of a tangent for
your quandary, but it sometimes infuriates me how many in our industry
try to apply/enforce/design around the recommended illuminance level
tables without reading the (short!) chapter discussing what they mean
and how they're intended to be used and not used.  They are emphatically
NOT "minimums."  I have been cornered on this a few times by select
individuals outside of a LEED review - suffice to say reviewers who
don't learn what they're enforcing run the risk of demonstrating their
incompetence.

 

It appears: (1) your reviewer does not understand task-ambient lighting
and could use some education in that dept and (2) you have not
communicated exactly what that 20fc figure means.  Your reviewer has the
impression task surfaces will only have 20fc after all sources (which
would be bad lighting for an architecture studio).  Correct that
impression, and further explain how the targeted illuminance values are
going to be achieved.

 

"Installed interior lighting power" is a 90.1 glossary term.  For
90.1-2004/2007, it only includes "permanently installed" fixtures*.
Reviewer is having a quibble over vocabulary... If I'm not mistaken,
desk lamps are plug loads, and plug loads are process loads.  Simple.
Perhaps different terminology is part of any revisions you may need to
make.   I think the term "process lighting" is something your reviewer
may be making up, but he/she is referring to lighting integral to
refrigerator casework and such in that long list of exceptions... you
should not need to "exempt" desk lamps because they're not permanently
installed and so inherently are not part of "installed interior lighting
power" to begin with. 

 

9.6.3(b) is for VDT's (computer screens) - sorta confusing reference...
Does anyone know if there is precedent for this?  The function of this
passage as I understand it is to permit additional lighting beyond the
interior lighting power allowance under the space-by-space method... not
to limit task lighting within the allowance.  Again, I think the term
"task-ambient" is throwing your reviewer off.

 

I have not attempted documenting this myself, but am not aware of
anything in 90.1 or the IESNA Handbook that disallows the use of
non-permanently installed lighting (however variable it may be in a
college setting) to achieve the targeted illuminance values.  This may
warrant some investigation however to be sure.

tb,

After, you have read through this  couple of times, or looked at it in
an Excel table, you will figure out the changes you have to make and
make them. Always remember, do the proposed case first and then back out
the baseline, which must meet the applicable code. 

I think in a case like this building you would have had a different
result if you had attached, or put into the form, what you were trying
to do and how you did it. Your explanation is quite good and it gives
the reviewers something to look at besides numbers. Then you get to
exercise both sides of your brain.

Cheers,

Carol

Sorry for the long attachment here, but this LEED v2.2 EAc1 comment has
me really confused so I want to post it in its entirety.

 

1.    The EAc1 Narrative describes the interior lighting design target
for all studio spaces is 20 fc and that task lights have been modeled
identically in the Baseline and Proposed case. However, according to the
IESNA Lighting Handbook, ninth edition, the minimum horizontal design
illuminance for art studios is 50 fc and for reading areas with
handwritten tasks is 30 fc. The ASHRAE allowances represent the power
allowance required to meet the minimum IESNA illuminance requirements
for various space types. It is inappropriate to claim savings for
designs that do not meet the minimum lighting level requirements and
model the additional lighting power in the Baseline for lighting in the
Proposed that is required to perform the anticipated tasks.

Also, Table 1.4 reports that 4.02 kW of process lighting has been
modeled in both cases, and it is assumed that this represents the task
lighting. Process lighting is limited to the exempt interior lighting
applications described in Section 9.2.2.3. Task lighting is regulated
and thus not considered a process load. Section 9.6.3(b) does provide an
additional allowance for task lighting when the Space by Space Method is
used, but this may not be used for lighting required to raise the
ambient lighting to meet the required lighting levels. If this
additional allowance is used in the Proposed design, the Baseline must
be modeled with the same power as the Proposed up to the 0.35 W/square
foot allowance. Please remove all task lighting power from the Baseline
model that is required to meet the IESNA recommended illuminance levels.
If any of the additional allowance from Section 9.2.2.3 is applied to
the Baseline case, provide calculations verifying that this additional
lighting is not required in the Proposed case to meet the required
illuminance levels and confirming that this only represents the portion
of the additional allowance that is used in the Proposed case.

My first question; isn't low ambient-task specific a commonly accepted
energy use reduction strategy? Why would I model a lighting design in
the proposed solution which isn't installed and how would one determine,
without an extensive lighting design effort, the appropriate lighting
power to achieve 50fc, or 30fc? (not quite sure which one they want) 

Second, the spaces in question are architecture college studios. If the
task lighting is a plug in desk lamp, provided by the student, then am I
correct in assuming it's not regulated by 9.2.2.3? I've assumed 60W per
lamp as plug load, but there no way that the lamp type or light
distribution can be controlled as defined in 9.6.3.b, nor is it a given
that a lamp will be used. 

 

I'm at a loss as to how to respond to this. 

 

Thanks for any input.

O.K.



So much for me reading my email...in fact, I did indeed get this but did nothing.



However, even though there was an email about this, there was no discussion about this at the June IBPSA-USA meeting, nor was there a request for this to be put on the agenda at the June ASHRAE meeting for TC 4.7, Standard 140, or other committees of interest. In addition, Charles Eley has held several conference calls (some of which I've attended), which have discussed COMNet, yet this was not mentioned on any of the calls I attended.



In addition, such documents like this, if they are coordinated with ASHRAE, will usually be sent to RAC then to the TCs for comment, back to RAC and then back to DOE.



Finally, if this effort was truly important to DOE, why are there no other participants from the other National Labs? Why is NREL the only lab with expertise in this area? Or for that matter, why are there no individuals from outside the US? Or even Canada?  Seems fishy.



Somehow, I still don't get a warm, friendly feeling about this.

Opportunity Announcement

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is currently
sponsoring a project to develop (1) job task analyses (JTAs), which
identify and catalog all of the activities a worker performs in a
given job; and (2) the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs), which
define the minimum requirements necessary for a person to adequately
perform those tasks, for the following six commercial building job
categories:

- Energy modeler
- Operating engineer/building technician
- Building energy auditor
- Energy/sustainability manager
- Commissioning/retro-
commissioning practitioner
- Facility manager

The project goal is to create "national guidelines" which will define
a common body of knowledge that any training organization will be able
to draw from when developing curriculum, helping to bring the core
competencies imparted by training organizations to their trainees into
common alignment. This body of knowledge will also be used by the
General Services Administration and the Department of Energy to help
meet the requirements of the Federal Buildings Personnel Training Act
of 2010.

To facilitate development of the JTAs/KSAs, Professional Testing,
Inc. is seeking current industry practitioners who are interested in
helping to define, promote energy efficiency in, and support their
field of practice by participating in these JTA/KSA development
workshops. Interested individuals are invited to submit their
credentials at http://proftesting.rapidinsites.com<http://proftesting.rapidinsites.com/>. Please note that
each JTA/KSA workshop will take place in Denver, Colorado and is
anticipated to last 3 full days (not including travel). Reimbursement
for travel costs up to a fixed amount and a travel per diem will be
awarded to individuals selected for participation. Additional project
details, including how practitioners will be selected and where to
direct project-related questions, can be found using the above link.

NREL and Professional Testing, Inc. are excited to present this unique
opportunity for individuals to have their voices heard in this
important discussion. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
The NREL Commercial Workforce Development Team

My apologies Daniel, I suddenly realized that I am so old as to be before
your time. I was project manager on the BLAST energy analysis program and
my colleague and thesis adviser, Curt Pedersen was head of the BLAST
support office and one of the project managers of EnergyPlus. We both have
been very active in ASHRAE Technical Committee 4.7, Energy Calculations and
4.1 Load  Calculation.  I recently retired from Colorado State University
where I taught HVAC design including energy modeling (BLAST, EnergyPlus via
DesignBuilder, TRACE, TRANSIS, etc.). I feel fortunate that a number of our
former students are now your colleagues at NREL.

As you no doubt know, the words "certification" and "licensure exam" (see
your clarifying email) are loaded phrases in the consulting engineering
community. While most practitioners support professional engineering exams
and licensing, requirements for additional, new certification are not
likely to be widely embraced, at least not until they can be shown to have
some economic or other value. Furthermore, it may not be enough for
cognizant organizations to be aware of your JTA work. Groups like NCEES and
ASHRAE have to be early proponents of any certification or licensing
program that might result from your project. Otherwise Republicans and Tea
Partiers will claim that you are proposing more intrusive, job-killing
government regulations (be clear, *I* am NOT expressing this opinion).

Aside from the (probably) uncontroversial goals of guiding training and
education, and helping with job descriptions, what are the project goals
and expected outcomes. Are the results to be used to create an industry
standard (like standard 90)? Are parts of the work to be incorporated into
building codes? Do you hope to create a Professional Engineering Exam for
Energy Modeling? Perhaps the answer is "all of the above." The JTA report
is vague about this, perhaps intentionally.

Just exactly why are you and your team doing this work? Who are its
proponents? What are the hoped-for impacts? Who will be affected in the
long run? I am not trying to be critical by asking these questions but
without the answers it is hard to review the report.

Lastly, many energy modelers have a personal mantra that is not listed in
your report: "It helps to know what you are doing!" If I were hiring that
would be the main qualification.

Regards,

Doug Hittle

PS Can we all assume that these email exchanges will be considered as
qualifying comments on the report as requested by Dr. Roth?

All,

Apologies for the confusion. I had been responding previously only to the Bldg-sim listserv, as opposed to both the Bldg-sim and IBSPA-USA listservs. Below is my response earlier this evening to Nick Caton's email inquiry (again, sent only to the Bldg-sim listserv). Also, since things seemed to be quickly fragmenting, I have attempted to paste below all emails on this topic, so that everyone can easily reference them. I will follow up to the two most recent emails in a separate posting so that others may follow the conversation more easily.

Thanks,
Danny

Nick,

Your concerns are entirely understandable, but perhaps a little overstated. The intention with this project was to produce documents that could be used by the corresponding sectors to improve existing, or if necessary, create new, training/certification materials, thus leading to a more qualified and effective workforce. If you take a look at the job categories we targeted, I think you will see that we focused on jobs that have a direct impact on commercial building energy use.

The development of specific training/certification materials however, is being left up to the training/certification providers in each industry. Our goal was to eliminate the heavy lift for such organizations by facilitating the identification (by industry, not by DOE or NREL) of what tasks were required in each job category, and what knowledge, skills, and abilities were required to perform each of those tasks. The idea is that organizations who have existing training/certification programs can self-compare their program to the developed JTA to determine if they are adequately meeting industry's needs. Or, for industries where few training/certification programs exist, organizations could use the developed JTAs to immediately start developing curricula (the DACUM method is often used to create curricula at the community college level). Through these mechanisms, the idea was to improve the quality and amount of training available to the end-user (in this case, the modeler), with the ultimate goal being a reduction in real energy use at the building level.

Additionally, the JTAs can be used as a standardized metric of sorts to evaluate existing training/certification programs. We are currently working on a tool that will allow an end-user in each of the six fields to examine what content different training/certification programs cover, using the JTAs as a baseline (so that folks are comparing apples to apples, instead of apples to oranges). That way, they can make a more informed decision about where to invest their time and money when pursuing professional development activities.

I do know that GSA is planning to utilize the JTAs to support efforts related to the Federal Buildings Personnel Training Act of 2010. What other items (new licensure/certification/PDH requirements for government/military contracted work, etc.) will come out of this work I cannot speak to, as those decisions are likely to be out of my control and should they arise, will likely be made within each corresponding organization, far from my purview.

I know this is another long response, and that I did not directly address several of your questions. However, I felt that clarifying the project purpose would actually eliminate the need for such answers. If you feel differently let me know and I'll try to go through and provide more specifics.

Thanks,
Danny

My apologies Daniel, I suddenly realized that I am so old as to be before your time. I was project manager on the BLAST energy analysis program and my colleague and thesis adviser, Curt Pedersen was head of the BLAST support office and one of the project managers of EnergyPlus. We both have been very active in ASHRAE Technical Committee 4.7, Energy Calculations and 4.1 Load  Calculation.  I recently retired from Colorado State University where I taught HVAC design including energy modeling (BLAST, EnergyPlus via DesignBuilder, TRACE, TRANSIS, etc.). I feel fortunate that a number of our former students are now your colleagues at NREL.

As you no doubt know, the words "certification" and "licensure exam" (see your clarifying email) are loaded phrases in the consulting engineering community. While most practitioners support professional engineering exams and licensing, requirements for additional, new certification are not likely to be widely embraced, at least not until they can be shown to have some economic or other value. Furthermore, it may not be enough for cognizant organizations to be aware of your JTA work. Groups like NCEES and ASHRAE have to be early proponents of any certification or licensing program that might result from your project. Otherwise Republicans and Tea Partiers will claim that you are proposing more intrusive, job-killing government regulations (be clear, I am NOT expressing this opinion).

Aside from the (probably) uncontroversial goals of guiding training and education, and helping with job descriptions, what are the project goals and expected outcomes. Are the results to be used to create an industry standard (like standard 90)? Are parts of the work to be incorporated into building codes? Do you hope to create a Professional Engineering Exam for Energy Modeling? Perhaps the answer is "all of the above." The JTA report is vague about this, perhaps intentionally.

Just exactly why are you and your team doing this work? Who are its proponents? What are the hoped-for impacts? Who will be affected in the long run? I am not trying to be critical by asking these questions but without the answers it is hard to review the report.

Lastly, many energy modelers have a personal mantra that is not listed in your report: "It helps to know what you are doing!" If I were hiring that would be the main qualification.

Regards,

Doug Hittle

PS Can we all assume that these email exchanges will be considered as qualifying comments on the report as requested by Dr. Roth?

O.K.



So much for me reading my email...in fact, I did indeed get this but did nothing.



However, even though there was an email about this, there was no discussion about this at the June IBPSA-USA meeting, nor was there a request for this to be put on the agenda at the June ASHRAE meeting for TC 4.7, Standard 140, or other committees of interest. In addition, Charles Eley has held several conference calls (some of which I've attended), which have discussed COMNet, yet this was not mentioned on any of the calls I attended.



In addition, such documents like this, if they are coordinated with ASHRAE, will usually be sent to RAC then to the TCs for comment, back to RAC and then back to DOE.



Finally, if this effort was truly important to DOE, why are there no other participants from the other National Labs? Why is NREL the only lab with expertise in this area? Or for that matter, why are there no individuals from outside the US? Or even Canada?  Seems fishy.



Somehow, I still don't get a warm, friendly feeling about this.



Jeff

The following went out on the Bldg-sim listserve in March 2011.

Also, the IBPSA Wiki known as BEMBook is mostly empty. Maybe there's another one that I am unaware of?

Opportunity Announcement

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is currently
sponsoring a project to develop (1) job task analyses (JTAs), which
identify and catalog all of the activities a worker performs in a
given job; and (2) the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs), which
define the minimum requirements necessary for a person to adequately
perform those tasks, for the following six commercial building job
categories:

- Energy modeler
- Operating engineer/building technician
- Building energy auditor
- Energy/sustainability manager
- Commissioning/retro-
commissioning practitioner
- Facility manager

The project goal is to create "national guidelines" which will define
a common body of knowledge that any training organization will be able
to draw from when developing curriculum, helping to bring the core
competencies imparted by training organizations to their trainees into
common alignment. This body of knowledge will also be used by the
General Services Administration and the Department of Energy to help
meet the requirements of the Federal Buildings Personnel Training Act
of 2010.

To facilitate development of the JTAs/KSAs, Professional Testing,
Inc. is seeking current industry practitioners who are interested in
helping to define, promote energy efficiency in, and support their
field of practice by participating in these JTA/KSA development
workshops. Interested individuals are invited to submit their
credentials at http://proftesting.rapidinsites.com<http://proftesting.rapidinsites.com/>. Please note that
each JTA/KSA workshop will take place in Denver, Colorado and is
anticipated to last 3 full days (not including travel). Reimbursement
for travel costs up to a fixed amount and a travel per diem will be
awarded to individuals selected for participation. Additional project
details, including how practitioners will be selected and where to
direct project-related questions, can be found using the above link.

NREL and Professional Testing, Inc. are excited to present this unique
opportunity for individuals to have their voices heard in this
important discussion. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
The NREL Commercial Workforce Development Team

Daniel.



I'm afraid I can't agree that you conducted "extensive outreach" to prepare this document. For example, there was no discussion of this, before it happened, on any of the list servers before it came out. In addition, there was no "call for experts" that I was aware of. Normally, for a document like this that is sponsored by DOE, one would expect a call of some sort through the usual list servers.



In addition, I noticed from your list, that there is nobody who directly represents IBPSA-USA, nor even ASHRAE TC 4.7, which is the responsible ASHRAE TC for energy modeling. Although there are several individuals on the list who attend IBPSA and ASHRAE meetings and are well-known. It seems like little was done to notify others in IBPSA-USA or ASHRAE.



You should know that IBPSA-USA has also worked for some time on such an effort, which now exists as a wiki, under Joe Deringer's guidance. It also held a workshop in Boulder, and developed the BEM exam with ASHRAE. Yet, I see no reference to this or any of the previous efforts, nor efforts made to contact those of us who worked on this.



Finally, there are also at least a dozen or more educators within IBPSA-USA who teach Energy Modeling at the University level, yet not one of these individuals is mentioned in your list of contributors, only one academic appears on your list.



Hence, I suggest that if DOE is serious about making this a consensus document, then it needs to do a better job contacting the relevant organizations to obtain input and not rely on an email response after the fact.



Clearly, this is not the case with this document.



Jeff

Daniel,

Thank you so much for this clarification!  I have to sympathize with Mr. Hittle in that, despite the apparent efforts to "spread the word," I too feel somewhat unsure of what the real implications will be for myself and my colleagues in the energy modeling world.

My current impression is that the results of this study will ultimately manifest as some sort of new licensure/certification/PDH requirements for modeling services in future LEED and/or military/government contracted work (i.e. DoD/GSA contracts)...  does that sound right?

Maybe an illustration would be helpful... This is from the comment document:

"JTA is traditionally used by secondary and postsecondary educators, test developers, and business, industry, government, and military trainers to help identify core knowledge areas, critical work functions, and skills that are common across a representative sampling of current practitioners."

Can you provide an example of what JTA's have accomplished for those working in the above industries?

For better or for worse, my concern is this study is going to add additional layers of beauracracy to the job description... Great news (enforced business) for those in the licensing/training industries I suppose, but will there be a net benefit for the actual practitioners?  Are my concerns unrealistic or missing the point?

Thanks again for your time and efforts!

Mr. Hittle,

My name is Daniel Studer and I am an engineer at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. I also happen to be the project lead for DOE's commercial job/task analysis development work.

I can assure you that we have conducted extensive outreach to ensure that persons who operate in the spaces targeted by these JTAs are fully aware of the work being performed, including ASHRAE.

The energy modeler JTA itself was created over the course of three days by eleven practicing energy modelers who were guided through the process by a professional psychometrician. The names and associated organizations of each of these folks are listed at the back of the JTA, in case you are curious. DOE and NREL had zero input into the content of this document. And to ensure that the document is truly reflective of the industry, DOE has decided to make the documents available for public comment. That way, individuals such as yourself can provide DOE with constructive feedback to ensure that the document content is both appropriate and valid.

The intent of the project, as stated on the project website, is to:
Provide a basis for developing and comparing new and existing training programs in the commercial building sector. This will help individuals identify opportunities to enhance their professional skills, enable industry to identify an appropriately skilled workforce, and allow training providers to ensure that they are providing the highest quality product possible.

In short, we are trying to document the job as it currently exists so that training/certification providers can ensure that they are providing high quality products in line with industry's identified needs. Additionally, gathering this information using the objective approach that we have also has the side benefit of creating a sort of baseline document that can be used to help a training/certification end user better understand how their current skill set and existing training/certification options fit together.

I totally agree with you that items identified such as "time management skills" are not very measurable, and in fact seem both excessive and irrelevant, in the context of developing a training program or certification around this material. However, such information is very valuable in other contexts, which is why it is included in any JTA which utilizes the "developing a curriculum" (DACUM) method. The idea is that all aspects of the job should be documented so that the resultant analysis can be used for multiple purposes. For example, an individual wishing to develop a job posting may look at the JTA and include items such as "time management skills" or "spatial skills" in the job posting. They could then structure interview questions to better understand that person's abilities in those areas to make a more informed decision about a candidate.

In other JTAs that were developed under this project, SMEs also identified physical attributes necessary to perform the job (e.g., lift X lbs over head, see X feet). While these may also seem silly, they become very important when developing high risk assessments, such as licensure exams, in these spaces.

The real meat of each document is the DACUM chart located at the back of each. These charts identify the specific domain areas, tasks, and steps that the SMEs identified were necessary to perform the specified job. It is this content specifically that is of most use to training/certification providers, which is why DOE asked for comments on this specific chart in the Federal Register notice.

The proposed content blueprint tables (located near the front of each document), contain the SME's proposed weights for how often, and how important, each of the identified tasks is to the job. Such weights provide valuable context to training/certification providers by serving as guidelines for how much time should be devoted to each topic.

As part of this project, NREL will be facilitating a "survey validation" which will provide industry with the opportunity to adjust these weighting factors. However, to avoid the confusion that would occur with two "comment periods" occurring at once, this will not happen until DOE's public comment closes at the end of November.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any additional questions.

Thanks,
Danny

I would like to be grandfathered in please. Who is scrutinizing this document (proposed regulation?) at ASHRAE headquarters? Have you had any input from ASHRAE?

If you were to do a jta for President of the United States it might not be so lengthy as the one for building energy modelers. (And, a lot of folks in the current primary would be automatically excluded). Is it possible that we have the cart before the horse? Perhaps we need a jta for building architects and building design engineers of which energy modelers could be a subset.  I am sure that if DOE proposed a regulatory test procedure for architects and engineers there would be plenty of comment.

I've looked at the document. What caught my attentions was the list of "skills and abilities." These included such thing as "time management skills," "critical thinking," and  "spatial skills."  Assuming that the goal is to define measurable skills, we might want to give energy modeler want-a-be s the SAT again.

Then I saw "common sense" and "patience" as skills and abilities. Now, not withstanding the jta, I consider myself a competent modeler of buildings and their energy systems. We don't need to vote on that but I also am reasonably sure that "patience" has only recently kicked in as a personal skill (maybe I am being optimistic). How are we going to measure the "common sense" of someone who wants to apply to be an energy modeler?

Dr. Roth, it is not clear that very many in the building sciences field are aware of your project, its history, and potential impact. Perhaps you could get on the agenda at an upcoming ASHRAE meeting and explain the process and your intent for the project outcomes.

Respectfully,
Doug Hittle

The DOE has put together a job task analysis (JTA)--job description plus required knowledge and skills--for building energy modelers.  The draft document, created by a group of 15 energy modeling professionals, can be found here:

http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/commercial_initiative/pdfs/energy_modeler_jta_comment.pdf



DOE is accepting comments on this draft until November 28, 2011 at this URL: http://www.nrel.gov/ap/buildings_workforce_feedback/. Very few comments have been received so far. I urge you to review and comment on this draft as the final document will provide the foundation for future education, training and certification programs and will likely have to be complied with going forward by existing programs, e.g., ASHRAE BEMP. In addition to constructive critique, positive comments, e.g., "perfect, don't change a thing", are also welcome.

Please note that this email contains responses to postings by both Mr. Haberl and Mr. Hittle.

Mr. Haberl:

The purpose of each JTA is to capture the job as currently practiced. Such a baseline document is essential in order to fairly and objectively identify knowledge and training gaps that exist between where any industry is and where it "should" be.

As such, we went to extreme efforts ensure that psychometrically valid sets of SMEs were selected to define the documents. Besides having to prove that they were current practitioners in the field, applicants were screened by a psychometrician (not DOE or NREL) using criteria such as geographic location, years of experience, and industry credentials to ensure that the selected group was broad with respect to all of these criteria (this is outlined in slightly more detail in the JTAs themselves). Bias in any one of these areas (experienced folks over novices, people from the east coast vs. the southwest, etc.) would have favored a particular group and skewed the resulting document in favor of that particular group's thinking. Since we were attempting to adequately capture the job as practiced in the U.S. (not as practiced by experts in the U.S., or by academics in the U.S., or how it should be done according to organization X, etc.), we wanted the broadest U.S. representation possible. This is also why there were no international participants.

Clearly, the inclusion of any professional society or organization directly involved in the development of such a document would also skew, whether meaning to or not, the resulting document toward the viewpoint of said organization. Indeed, to prevent this from happening, no outside reference materials were allowed into the workshops. Thus, the material presented in the JTAs comes directly from the first-hand knowledge of the participants. The resulting JTAs were all created by practitioners detailing what it was they did in their jobs.

I believe that the Boulder meeting you mentioned was the BEM Innovation Summit, which was hosted by RMI in Boulder last spring. The following is from PDF page 36 (document page 32) of the post summit report (http://rmi.org/Content/Files/BEM_Report_FINAL.pdf):
"Additionally, the DOE is currently sponsoring a project to develop (1) job task analyses (JTAs), which identify and catalog all of the activities a worker performs in a given job; and (2) the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs), which define the minimum requirements necessary to adequately perform those tasks, for six building job categories, including "energy modeler". The project goal is to create "national guidelines" which will define a common body of knowledge that any training organization will be able to draw from when developing curriculum, helping to ensure consistent core competencies among training programs."

An action item identified in that same report (PDF page 38) reads: "Respond to Doe's RFP to develop "national guidelines" for energy modeling education."



Mr. Hittle,

Congratulations on your recent retirement; that is one of my near-term goals (to be accompanied by a private island though).

I believe that you may not have seen my previous email to Nick Caton, which I believe (again, opinion) may answer most of the questions you pose. If not, please feel free to let me know and I will do my best to answer them. Like I said in my last email, this thread is getting a little fragmented.

However, I can answer one of the questions you pose here. The Federal Register notice released by DOE (http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-10-14/pdf/2011-26645.pdf) details the means by which they will accept public comment. While email is one of those means, said email must be sent to a specific email address and accompanied by a signed copy (there are other, less burdensome ways to submit comments as well). So in response to your question, no, this correspondence will not be officially documented as comments received on the documents.

Thanks all for the lively discussion!

Danny

All,

Apologies for the confusion. I had been responding previously only to the Bldg-sim listserv, as opposed to both the Bldg-sim and IBSPA-USA listservs. Below is my response earlier this evening to Nick Caton's email inquiry (again, sent only to the Bldg-sim listserv). Also, since things seemed to be quickly fragmenting, I have attempted to paste below all emails on this topic, so that everyone can easily reference them. I will follow up to the two most recent emails in a separate posting so that others may follow the conversation more easily.

Thanks,

Nick,

Your concerns are entirely understandable, but perhaps a little overstated. The intention with this project was to produce documents that could be used by the corresponding sectors to improve existing, or if necessary, create new, training/certification materials, thus leading to a more qualified and effective workforce. If you take a look at the job categories we targeted, I think you will see that we focused on jobs that have a direct impact on commercial building energy use.

The development of specific training/certification materials however, is being left up to the training/certification providers in each industry. Our goal was to eliminate the heavy lift for such organizations by facilitating the identification (by industry, not by DOE or NREL) of what tasks were required in each job category, and what knowledge, skills, and abilities were required to perform each of those tasks. The idea is that organizations who have existing training/certification programs can self-compare their program to the developed JTA to determine if they are adequately meeting industry's needs. Or, for industries where few training/certification programs exist, organizations could use the developed JTAs to immediately start developing curricula (the DACUM method is often used to create curricula at the community college level). Through these mechanisms, the idea was to improve the quality and amount of training available to the end-user (in this case, the modeler), with the ultimate goal being a reduction in real energy use at the building level.

Additionally, the JTAs can be used as a standardized metric of sorts to evaluate existing training/certification programs. We are currently working on a tool that will allow an end-user in each of the six fields to examine what content different training/certification programs cover, using the JTAs as a baseline (so that folks are comparing apples to apples, instead of apples to oranges). That way, they can make a more informed decision about where to invest their time and money when pursuing professional development activities.

I do know that GSA is planning to utilize the JTAs to support efforts related to the Federal Buildings Personnel Training Act of 2010. What other items (new licensure/certification/PDH requirements for government/military contracted work, etc.) will come out of this work I cannot speak to, as those decisions are likely to be out of my control and should they arise, will likely be made within each corresponding organization, far from my purview.

I know this is another long response, and that I did not directly address several of your questions. However, I felt that clarifying the project purpose would actually eliminate the need for such answers. If you feel differently let me know and I'll try to go through and provide more specifics.

Thanks,
Danny

My apologies Daniel, I suddenly realized that I am so old as to be before your time. I was project manager on the BLAST energy analysis program and my colleague and thesis adviser, Curt Pedersen was head of the BLAST support office and one of the project managers of EnergyPlus. We both have been very active in ASHRAE Technical Committee 4.7, Energy Calculations and 4.1 Load  Calculation.  I recently retired from Colorado State University where I taught HVAC design including energy modeling (BLAST, EnergyPlus via DesignBuilder, TRACE, TRANSIS, etc.). I feel fortunate that a number of our former students are now your colleagues at NREL.

As you no doubt know, the words "certification" and "licensure exam" (see your clarifying email) are loaded phrases in the consulting engineering community. While most practitioners support professional engineering exams and licensing, requirements for additional, new certification are not likely to be widely embraced, at least not until they can be shown to have some economic or other value. Furthermore, it may not be enough for cognizant organizations to be aware of your JTA work. Groups like NCEES and ASHRAE have to be early proponents of any certification or licensing program that might result from your project. Otherwise Republicans and Tea Partiers will claim that you are proposing more intrusive, job-killing government regulations (be clear, I am NOT expressing this opinion).

Aside from the (probably) uncontroversial goals of guiding training and education, and helping with job descriptions, what are the project goals and expected outcomes. Are the results to be used to create an industry standard (like standard 90)? Are parts of the work to be incorporated into building codes? Do you hope to create a Professional Engineering Exam for Energy Modeling? Perhaps the answer is "all of the above." The JTA report is vague about this, perhaps intentionally.

Just exactly why are you and your team doing this work? Who are its proponents? What are the hoped-for impacts? Who will be affected in the long run? I am not trying to be critical by asking these questions but without the answers it is hard to review the report.

Lastly, many energy modelers have a personal mantra that is not listed in your report: "It helps to know what you are doing!" If I were hiring that would be the main qualification.

Regards,

Doug Hittle

PS Can we all assume that these email exchanges will be considered as qualifying comments on the report as requested by Dr. Roth?

O.K.



So much for me reading my email...in fact, I did indeed get this but did nothing.



However, even though there was an email about this, there was no discussion about this at the June IBPSA-USA meeting, nor was there a request for this to be put on the agenda at the June ASHRAE meeting for TC 4.7, Standard 140, or other committees of interest. In addition, Charles Eley has held several conference calls (some of which I've attended), which have discussed COMNet, yet this was not mentioned on any of the calls I attended.



In addition, such documents like this, if they are coordinated with ASHRAE, will usually be sent to RAC then to the TCs for comment, back to RAC and then back to DOE.



Finally, if this effort was truly important to DOE, why are there no other participants from the other National Labs? Why is NREL the only lab with expertise in this area? Or for that matter, why are there no individuals from outside the US? Or even Canada?  Seems fishy.



Somehow, I still don't get a warm, friendly feeling about this.

Opportunity Announcement

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is currently
sponsoring a project to develop (1) job task analyses (JTAs), which
identify and catalog all of the activities a worker performs in a
given job; and (2) the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs), which
define the minimum requirements necessary for a person to adequately
perform those tasks, for the following six commercial building job
categories:

- Energy modeler
- Operating engineer/building technician
- Building energy auditor
- Energy/sustainability manager
- Commissioning/retro-
commissioning practitioner
- Facility manager

The project goal is to create "national guidelines" which will define
a common body of knowledge that any training organization will be able
to draw from when developing curriculum, helping to bring the core
competencies imparted by training organizations to their trainees into
common alignment. This body of knowledge will also be used by the
General Services Administration and the Department of Energy to help
meet the requirements of the Federal Buildings Personnel Training Act
of 2010.

To facilitate development of the JTAs/KSAs, Professional Testing,
Inc. is seeking current industry practitioners who are interested in
helping to define, promote energy efficiency in, and support their
field of practice by participating in these JTA/KSA development
workshops. Interested individuals are invited to submit their
credentials at http://proftesting.rapidinsites.com<http://proftesting.rapidinsites.com/>. Please note that
each JTA/KSA workshop will take place in Denver, Colorado and is
anticipated to last 3 full days (not including travel). Reimbursement
for travel costs up to a fixed amount and a travel per diem will be
awarded to individuals selected for participation. Additional project
details, including how practitioners will be selected and where to
direct project-related questions, can be found using the above link.

NREL and Professional Testing, Inc. are excited to present this unique
opportunity for individuals to have their voices heard in this
important discussion. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
The NREL Commercial Workforce Development Team

Daniel.



I'm afraid I can't agree that you conducted "extensive outreach" to prepare this document. For example, there was no discussion of this, before it happened, on any of the list servers before it came out. In addition, there was no "call for experts" that I was aware of. Normally, for a document like this that is sponsored by DOE, one would expect a call of some sort through the usual list servers.



In addition, I noticed from your list, that there is nobody who directly represents IBPSA-USA, nor even ASHRAE TC 4.7, which is the responsible ASHRAE TC for energy modeling. Although there are several individuals on the list who attend IBPSA and ASHRAE meetings and are well-known. It seems like little was done to notify others in IBPSA-USA or ASHRAE.



You should know that IBPSA-USA has also worked for some time on such an effort, which now exists as a wiki, under Joe Deringer's guidance. It also held a workshop in Boulder, and developed the BEM exam with ASHRAE. Yet, I see no reference to this or any of the previous efforts, nor efforts made to contact those of us who worked on this.



Finally, there are also at least a dozen or more educators within IBPSA-USA who teach Energy Modeling at the University level, yet not one of these individuals is mentioned in your list of contributors, only one academic appears on your list.



Hence, I suggest that if DOE is serious about making this a consensus document, then it needs to do a better job contacting the relevant organizations to obtain input and not rely on an email response after the fact.



Clearly, this is not the case with this document.

Daniel,

Thank you so much for this clarification!  I have to sympathize with Mr. Hittle in that, despite the apparent efforts to "spread the word," I too feel somewhat unsure of what the real implications will be for myself and my colleagues in the energy modeling world.

My current impression is that the results of this study will ultimately manifest as some sort of new licensure/certification/PDH requirements for modeling services in future LEED and/or military/government contracted work (i.e. DoD/GSA contracts)...  does that sound right?

Maybe an illustration would be helpful... This is from the comment document:

"JTA is traditionally used by secondary and postsecondary educators, test developers, and business, industry, government, and military trainers to help identify core knowledge areas, critical work functions, and skills that are common across a representative sampling of current practitioners."

Can you provide an example of what JTA's have accomplished for those working in the above industries?

For better or for worse, my concern is this study is going to add additional layers of beauracracy to the job description... Great news (enforced business) for those in the licensing/training industries I suppose, but will there be a net benefit for the actual practitioners?  Are my concerns unrealistic or missing the point?

Thanks again for your time and efforts!

Mr. Hittle,

My name is Daniel Studer and I am an engineer at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. I also happen to be the project lead for DOE's commercial job/task analysis development work.

I can assure you that we have conducted extensive outreach to ensure that persons who operate in the spaces targeted by these JTAs are fully aware of the work being performed, including ASHRAE.

The energy modeler JTA itself was created over the course of three days by eleven practicing energy modelers who were guided through the process by a professional psychometrician. The names and associated organizations of each of these folks are listed at the back of the JTA, in case you are curious. DOE and NREL had zero input into the content of this document. And to ensure that the document is truly reflective of the industry, DOE has decided to make the documents available for public comment. That way, individuals such as yourself can provide DOE with constructive feedback to ensure that the document content is both appropriate and valid.

The intent of the project, as stated on the project website, is to:
Provide a basis for developing and comparing new and existing training programs in the commercial building sector. This will help individuals identify opportunities to enhance their professional skills, enable industry to identify an appropriately skilled workforce, and allow training providers to ensure that they are providing the highest quality product possible.

In short, we are trying to document the job as it currently exists so that training/certification providers can ensure that they are providing high quality products in line with industry's identified needs. Additionally, gathering this information using the objective approach that we have also has the side benefit of creating a sort of baseline document that can be used to help a training/certification end user better understand how their current skill set and existing training/certification options fit together.

I totally agree with you that items identified such as "time management skills" are not very measurable, and in fact seem both excessive and irrelevant, in the context of developing a training program or certification around this material. However, such information is very valuable in other contexts, which is why it is included in any JTA which utilizes the "developing a curriculum" (DACUM) method. The idea is that all aspects of the job should be documented so that the resultant analysis can be used for multiple purposes. For example, an individual wishing to develop a job posting may look at the JTA and include items such as "time management skills" or "spatial skills" in the job posting. They could then structure interview questions to better understand that person's abilities in those areas to make a more informed decision about a candidate.

In other JTAs that were developed under this project, SMEs also identified physical attributes necessary to perform the job (e.g., lift X lbs over head, see X feet). While these may also seem silly, they become very important when developing high risk assessments, such as licensure exams, in these spaces.

The real meat of each document is the DACUM chart located at the back of each. These charts identify the specific domain areas, tasks, and steps that the SMEs identified were necessary to perform the specified job. It is this content specifically that is of most use to training/certification providers, which is why DOE asked for comments on this specific chart in the Federal Register notice.

The proposed content blueprint tables (located near the front of each document), contain the SME's proposed weights for how often, and how important, each of the identified tasks is to the job. Such weights provide valuable context to training/certification providers by serving as guidelines for how much time should be devoted to each topic.

As part of this project, NREL will be facilitating a "survey validation" which will provide industry with the opportunity to adjust these weighting factors. However, to avoid the confusion that would occur with two "comment periods" occurring at once, this will not happen until DOE's public comment closes at the end of November.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any additional questions.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] [Ibpsausa] DOE Job Task Analysis for Energy Modelers: Open for public comment until Nov. 28th

I would like to be grandfathered in please. Who is scrutinizing this document (proposed regulation?) at ASHRAE headquarters? Have you had any input from ASHRAE?

If you were to do a jta for President of the United States it might not be so lengthy as the one for building energy modelers. (And, a lot of folks in the current primary would be automatically excluded). Is it possible that we have the cart before the horse? Perhaps we need a jta for building architects and building design engineers of which energy modelers could be a subset.  I am sure that if DOE proposed a regulatory test procedure for architects and engineers there would be plenty of comment.

I've looked at the document. What caught my attentions was the list of "skills and abilities." These included such thing as "time management skills," "critical thinking," and  "spatial skills."  Assuming that the goal is to define measurable skills, we might want to give energy modeler want-a-be s the SAT again.

Then I saw "common sense" and "patience" as skills and abilities. Now, not withstanding the jta, I consider myself a competent modeler of buildings and their energy systems. We don't need to vote on that but I also am reasonably sure that "patience" has only recently kicked in as a personal skill (maybe I am being optimistic). How are we going to measure the "common sense" of someone who wants to apply to be an energy modeler?

Dr. Roth, it is not clear that very many in the building sciences field are aware of your project, its history, and potential impact. Perhaps you could get on the agenda at an upcoming ASHRAE meeting and explain the process and your intent for the project outcomes.

Respectfully,
Doug Hittle

Apologies for cross-posting,


The DOE has put together a job task analysis (JTA)--job description plus required knowledge and skills--for building energy modelers.  The draft document, created by a group of 15 energy modeling professionals, can be found here:

http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/commercial_initiative/pdfs/energy_modeler_jta_comment.pdf



DOE is accepting comments on this draft until November 28, 2011 at this URL: http://www.nrel.gov/ap/buildings_workforce_feedback/. Very few comments have been received so far. I urge you to review and comment on this draft as the final document will provide the foundation for future education, training and certification programs and will likely have to be complied with going forward by existing programs, e.g., ASHRAE BEMP. In addition to constructive critique, positive comments, e.g., "perfect, don't change a thing", are also welcome.


Thanks,

-Amir

Thanks for your responses Daniel. I now understand that your (DoE's)
purposes are to provide guidance to educators, trainers and job description
writers and to assist GSA and DoD in developing personnel training
programs. I gleaned this understanding from your remarks and from the
paragraphs from DoE solicitations and emails that you quoted. This being
the case, a lot of unproductive pot-stirring can be avoided if you were to
simply broadcast the fact that neither NREL nor DoE intends for the JTA
document to be the basis for any standard, building code,  certification
granting process, licensing process or any other form of regulation.  When
you do this, practitioners will be able to review the document in its
proper context and they will know that it won't and is not intended to
infringe on their right to practice.

Also I hope you will consider all input no matter how it is transmitted and
received.

Until tomorrow.
Doug Hittle

Daniel,



I still don't agree with your process. Your logic is flawed and most likely so is the document.



You excluded those organizations that could/will benefit from your document for no valid reason, and you have excluded known educators in this field, experts in the field, and other national labs.



For the most part this was developed off-line, out of public review. Hence the results of any such process cannot be trusted and the document must be regarded as being second rate.



Jeff

Please note that this email contains responses to postings by both Mr. Haberl and Mr. Hittle.

Mr. Haberl:

The purpose of each JTA is to capture the job as currently practiced. Such a baseline document is essential in order to fairly and objectively identify knowledge and training gaps that exist between where any industry is and where it ?should? be.

As such, we went to extreme efforts ensure that psychometrically valid sets of SMEs were selected to define the documents. Besides having to prove that they were current practitioners in the field, applicants were screened by a psychometrician (not DOE or NREL) using criteria such as geographic location, years of experience, and industry credentials to ensure that the selected group was broad with respect to all of these criteria (this is outlined in slightly more detail in the JTAs themselves). Bias in any one of these areas (experienced folks over novices, people from the east coast vs. the southwest, etc.) would have favored a particular group and skewed the resulting document in favor of that particular group?s thinking. Since we were attempting to adequately capture the job as practiced in the U.S. (not as practiced by experts in the U.S., or by academics in the U.S., or how it should be done according to organization X, etc.), we wanted the broadest U.S. representation possible. This is also why there were no international participants.

Clearly, the inclusion of any professional society or organization directly involved in the development of such a document would also skew, whether meaning to or not, the resulting document toward the viewpoint of said organization. Indeed, to prevent this from happening, no outside reference materials were allowed into the workshops. Thus, the material presented in the JTAs comes directly from the first-hand knowledge of the participants. The resulting JTAs were all created by practitioners detailing what it was they did in their jobs.

I believe that the Boulder meeting you mentioned was the BEM Innovation Summit, which was hosted by RMI in Boulder last spring. The following is from PDF page 36 (document page 32) of the post summit report (http://rmi.org/Content/Files/BEM_Report_FINAL.pdf):
?Additionally, the DOE is currently sponsoring a project to develop (1) job task analyses (JTAs), which identify and catalog all of the activities a worker performs in a given job; and (2) the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs), which define the minimum requirements necessary to adequately perform those tasks, for six building job categories, including ?energy modeler?. The project goal is to create ?national guidelines? which will define a common body of knowledge that any training organization will be able to draw from when developing curriculum, helping to ensure consistent core competencies among training programs.?

An action item identified in that same report (PDF page 38) reads: ?Respond to Doe?s RFP to develop ?national guidelines? for energy modeling education.?



Mr. Hittle,

Congratulations on your recent retirement; that is one of my near-term goals (to be accompanied by a private island though).

I believe that you may not have seen my previous email to Nick Caton, which I believe (again, opinion) may answer most of the questions you pose. If not, please feel free to let me know and I will do my best to answer them. Like I said in my last email, this thread is getting a little fragmented.

However, I can answer one of the questions you pose here. The Federal Register notice released by DOE (http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-10-14/pdf/2011-26645.pdf) details the means by which they will accept public comment. While email is one of those means, said email must be sent to a specific email address and accompanied by a signed copy (there are other, less burdensome ways to submit comments as well). So in response to your question, no, this correspondence will not be officially documented as comments received on the documents.

Thanks all for the lively discussion!

Danny

All,

Apologies for the confusion. I had been responding previously only to the Bldg-sim listserv, as opposed to both the Bldg-sim and IBSPA-USA listservs. Below is my response earlier this evening to Nick Caton?s email inquiry (again, sent only to the Bldg-sim listserv). Also, since things seemed to be quickly fragmenting, I have attempted to paste below all emails on this topic, so that everyone can easily reference them. I will follow up to the two most recent emails in a separate posting so that others may follow the conversation more easily.

Thanks,
Danny

Nick,

Your concerns are entirely understandable, but perhaps a little overstated. The intention with this project was to produce documents that could be used by the corresponding sectors to improve existing, or if necessary, create new, training/certification materials, thus leading to a more qualified and effective workforce. If you take a look at the job categories we targeted, I think you will see that we focused on jobs that have a direct impact on commercial building energy use.

The development of specific training/certification materials however, is being left up to the training/certification providers in each industry. Our goal was to eliminate the heavy lift for such organizations by facilitating the identification (by industry, not by DOE or NREL) of what tasks were required in each job category, and what knowledge, skills, and abilities were required to perform each of those tasks. The idea is that organizations who have existing training/certification programs can self-compare their program to the developed JTA to determine if they are adequately meeting industry?s needs. Or, for industries where few training/certification programs exist, organizations could use the developed JTAs to immediately start developing curricula (the DACUM method is often used to create curricula at the community college level). Through these mechanisms, the idea was to improve the quality and amount of training available to the end-user (in this case, the modeler), with the ultimate goal being a reduction in real energy use at the building level.

Additionally, the JTAs can be used as a standardized metric of sorts to evaluate existing training/certification programs. We are currently working on a tool that will allow an end-user in each of the six fields to examine what content different training/certification programs cover, using the JTAs as a baseline (so that folks are comparing apples to apples, instead of apples to oranges). That way, they can make a more informed decision about where to invest their time and money when pursuing professional development activities.

I do know that GSA is planning to utilize the JTAs to support efforts related to the Federal Buildings Personnel Training Act of 2010. What other items (new licensure/certification/PDH requirements for government/military contracted work, etc.) will come out of this work I cannot speak to, as those decisions are likely to be out of my control and should they arise, will likely be made within each corresponding organization, far from my purview.

I know this is another long response, and that I did not directly address several of your questions. However, I felt that clarifying the project purpose would actually eliminate the need for such answers. If you feel differently let me know and I?ll try to go through and provide more specifics.

Thanks,
Danny

My apologies Daniel, I suddenly realized that I am so old as to be before your time. I was project manager on the BLAST energy analysis program and my colleague and thesis adviser, Curt Pedersen was head of the BLAST support office and one of the project managers of EnergyPlus. We both have been very active in ASHRAE Technical Committee 4.7, Energy Calculations and 4.1 Load  Calculation.  I recently retired from Colorado State University where I taught HVAC design including energy modeling (BLAST, EnergyPlus via DesignBuilder, TRACE, TRANSIS, etc.). I feel fortunate that a number of our former students are now your colleagues at NREL.

As you no doubt know, the words "certification" and "licensure exam" (see your clarifying email) are loaded phrases in the consulting engineering community. While most practitioners support professional engineering exams and licensing, requirements for additional, new certification are not likely to be widely embraced, at least not until they can be shown to have some economic or other value. Furthermore, it may not be enough for cognizant organizations to be aware of your JTA work. Groups like NCEES and ASHRAE have to be early proponents of any certification or licensing program that might result from your project. Otherwise Republicans and Tea Partiers will claim that you are proposing more intrusive, job-killing government regulations (be clear, I am NOT expressing this opinion).

Aside from the (probably) uncontroversial goals of guiding training and education, and helping with job descriptions, what are the project goals and expected outcomes. Are the results to be used to create an industry standard (like standard 90)? Are parts of the work to be incorporated into building codes? Do you hope to create a Professional Engineering Exam for Energy Modeling? Perhaps the answer is "all of the above." The JTA report is vague about this, perhaps intentionally.

Just exactly why are you and your team doing this work? Who are its proponents? What are the hoped-for impacts? Who will be affected in the long run? I am not trying to be critical by asking these questions but without the answers it is hard to review the report.

Lastly, many energy modelers have a personal mantra that is not listed in your report: "It helps to know what you are doing!" If I were hiring that would be the main qualification.

Regards,

Doug Hittle

PS Can we all assume that these email exchanges will be considered as qualifying comments on the report as requested by Dr. Roth?

O.K.



So much for me reading my email...in fact, I did indeed get this but did nothing.



However, even though there was an email about this, there was no discussion about this at the June IBPSA-USA meeting, nor was there a request for this to be put on the agenda at the June ASHRAE meeting for TC 4.7, Standard 140, or other committees of interest. In addition, Charles Eley has held several conference calls (some of which I've attended), which have discussed COMNet, yet this was not mentioned on any of the calls I attended.



In addition, such documents like this, if they are coordinated with ASHRAE, will usually be sent to RAC then to the TCs for comment, back to RAC and then back to DOE.



Finally, if this effort was truly important to DOE, why are there no other participants from the other National Labs? Why is NREL the only lab with expertise in this area? Or for that matter, why are there no individuals from outside the US? Or even Canada?  Seems fishy.



Somehow, I still don't get a warm, friendly feeling about this.

Jeff,

The following went out on the Bldg-sim listserve in March 2011.

Also, the IBPSA Wiki known as BEMBook is mostly empty. Maybe there's another one that I am unaware of?

Opportunity Announcement

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is currently
sponsoring a project to develop (1) job task analyses (JTAs), which
identify and catalog all of the activities a worker performs in a
given job; and (2) the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs), which
define the minimum requirements necessary for a person to adequately
perform those tasks, for the following six commercial building job
categories:

- Energy modeler
- Operating engineer/building technician
- Building energy auditor
- Energy/sustainability manager
- Commissioning/retro-
commissioning practitioner
- Facility manager

The project goal is to create "national guidelines" which will define
a common body of knowledge that any training organization will be able
to draw from when developing curriculum, helping to bring the core
competencies imparted by training organizations to their trainees into
common alignment. This body of knowledge will also be used by the
General Services Administration and the Department of Energy to help
meet the requirements of the Federal Buildings Personnel Training Act
of 2010.

To facilitate development of the JTAs/KSAs, Professional Testing,
Inc. is seeking current industry practitioners who are interested in
helping to define, promote energy efficiency in, and support their
field of practice by participating in these JTA/KSA development
workshops. Interested individuals are invited to submit their
credentials at http://proftesting.rapidinsites.com<http://proftesting.rapidinsites.com/>. Please note that
each JTA/KSA workshop will take place in Denver, Colorado and is
anticipated to last 3 full days (not including travel). Reimbursement
for travel costs up to a fixed amount and a travel per diem will be
awarded to individuals selected for participation. Additional project

Daniel.



I'm afraid I can't agree that you conducted "extensive outreach" to prepare this document. For example, there was no discussion of this, before it happened, on any of the list servers before it came out. In addition, there was no "call for experts" that I was aware of. Normally, for a document like this that is sponsored by DOE, one would expect a call of some sort through the usual list servers.



In addition, I noticed from your list, that there is nobody who directly represents IBPSA-USA, nor even ASHRAE TC 4.7, which is the responsible ASHRAE TC for energy modeling. Although there are several individuals on the list who attend IBPSA and ASHRAE meetings and are well-known. It seems like little was done to notify others in IBPSA-USA or ASHRAE.



You should know that IBPSA-USA has also worked for some time on such an effort, which now exists as a wiki, under Joe Deringer's guidance. It also held a workshop in Boulder, and developed the BEM exam with ASHRAE. Yet, I see no reference to this or any of the previous efforts, nor efforts made to contact those of us who worked on this.



Finally, there are also at least a dozen or more educators within IBPSA-USA who teach Energy Modeling at the University level, yet not one of these individuals is mentioned in your list of contributors, only one academic appears on your list.



Hence, I suggest that if DOE is serious about making this a consensus document, then it needs to do a better job contacting the relevant organizations to obtain input and not rely on an email response after the fact.



Clearly, this is not the case with this document.

Daniel,

Thank you so much for this clarification!  I have to sympathize with Mr. Hittle in that, despite the apparent efforts to ?spread the word,? I too feel somewhat unsure of what the real implications will be for myself and my colleagues in the energy modeling world.

My current impression is that the results of this study will ultimately manifest as some sort of new licensure/certification/PDH requirements for modeling services in future LEED and/or military/government contracted work (i.e. DoD/GSA contracts)?  does that sound right?

Maybe an illustration would be helpful? This is from the comment document:

?JTA is traditionally used by secondary and postsecondary educators, test developers, and business, industry, government, and military trainers to help identify core knowledge areas, critical work functions, and skills that are common across a representative sampling of current practitioners.?

Can you provide an example of what JTA?s have accomplished for those working in the above industries?

For better or for worse, my concern is this study is going to add additional layers of beauracracy to the job description? Great news (enforced business) for those in the licensing/training industries I suppose, but will there be a net benefit for the actual practitioners?  Are my concerns unrealistic or missing the point?

Thanks again for your time and efforts!

Mr. Hittle,

My name is Daniel Studer and I am an engineer at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. I also happen to be the project lead for DOE?s commercial job/task analysis development work.

I can assure you that we have conducted extensive outreach to ensure that persons who operate in the spaces targeted by these JTAs are fully aware of the work being performed, including ASHRAE.

The energy modeler JTA itself was created over the course of three days by eleven practicing energy modelers who were guided through the process by a professional psychometrician. The names and associated organizations of each of these folks are listed at the back of the JTA, in case you are curious. DOE and NREL had zero input into the content of this document. And to ensure that the document is truly reflective of the industry, DOE has decided to make the documents available for public comment. That way, individuals such as yourself can provide DOE with constructive feedback to ensure that the document content is both appropriate and valid.

The intent of the project, as stated on the project website, is to:
Provide a basis for developing and comparing new and existing training programs in the commercial building sector. This will help individuals identify opportunities to enhance their professional skills, enable industry to identify an appropriately skilled workforce, and allow training providers to ensure that they are providing the highest quality product possible.

In short, we are trying to document the job as it currently exists so that training/certification providers can ensure that they are providing high quality products in line with industry?s identified needs. Additionally, gathering this information using the objective approach that we have also has the side benefit of creating a sort of baseline document that can be used to help a training/certification end user better understand how their current skill set and existing training/certification options fit together.

I totally agree with you that items identified such as ?time management skills? are not very measurable, and in fact seem both excessive and irrelevant, in the context of developing a training program or certification around this material. However, such information is very valuable in other contexts, which is why it is included in any JTA which utilizes the ?developing a curriculum? (DACUM) method. The idea is that all aspects of the job should be documented so that the resultant analysis can be used for multiple purposes. For example, an individual wishing to develop a job posting may look at the JTA and include items such as ?time management skills? or ?spatial skills? in the job posting. They could then structure interview questions to better understand that person?s abilities in those areas to make a more informed decision about a candidate.

In other JTAs that were developed under this project, SMEs also identified physical attributes necessary to perform the job (e.g., lift X lbs over head, see X feet). While these may also seem silly, they become very important when developing high risk assessments, such as licensure exams, in these spaces.

The real meat of each document is the DACUM chart located at the back of each. These charts identify the specific domain areas, tasks, and steps that the SMEs identified were necessary to perform the specified job. It is this content specifically that is of most use to training/certification providers, which is why DOE asked for comments on this specific chart in the Federal Register notice.

The proposed content blueprint tables (located near the front of each document), contain the SME?s proposed weights for how often, and how important, each of the identified tasks is to the job. Such weights provide valuable context to training/certification providers by serving as guidelines for how much time should be devoted to each topic.

As part of this project, NREL will be facilitating a ?survey validation? which will provide industry with the opportunity to adjust these weighting factors. However, to avoid the confusion that would occur with two ?comment periods? occurring at once, this will not happen until DOE?s public comment closes at the end of November.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any additional questions.

Thanks,
Danny

I would like to be grandfathered in please. Who is scrutinizing this document (proposed regulation?) at ASHRAE headquarters? Have you had any input from ASHRAE?

If you were to do a jta for President of the United States it might not be so lengthy as the one for building energy modelers. (And, a lot of folks in the current primary would be automatically excluded). Is it possible that we have the cart before the horse? Perhaps we need a jta for building architects and building design engineers of which energy modelers could be a subset.  I am sure that if DOE proposed a regulatory test procedure for architects and engineers there would be plenty of comment.

I've looked at the document. What caught my attentions was the list of "skills and abilities." These included such thing as "time management skills," "critical thinking," and  "spatial skills."  Assuming that the goal is to define measurable skills, we might want to give energy modeler want-a-be s the SAT again.

Then I saw "common sense" and "patience" as skills and abilities. Now, not withstanding the jta, I consider myself a competent modeler of buildings and their energy systems. We don't need to vote on that but I also am reasonably sure that "patience" has only recently kicked in as a personal skill (maybe I am being optimistic). How are we going to measure the "common sense" of someone who wants to apply to be an energy modeler?

Dr. Roth, it is not clear that very many in the building sciences field are aware of your project, its history, and potential impact. Perhaps you could get on the agenda at an upcoming ASHRAE meeting and explain the process and your intent for the project outcomes.

Respectfully,
Doug Hittle

Apologies for cross-posting,


The DOE has put together a job task analysis (JTA)--job description plus required knowledge and skills--for building energy modelers.  The draft document, created by a group of 15 energy modeling professionals, can be found here:

http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/commercial_initiative/pdfs/energy_modeler_jta_comment.pdf



DOE is accepting comments on this draft until November 28, 2011 at this URL: http://www.nrel.gov/ap/buildings_workforce_feedback/. Very few comments have been received so far. I urge you to review and comment on this draft as the final document will provide the foundation for future education, training and certification programs and will likely have to be complied with going forward by existing programs, e.g., ASHRAE BEMP. In addition to constructive critique, positive comments, e.g., "perfect, don't change a thing", are also welcome.

All,

 

I was reading all of these emails this morning and I will admit, I've
only scanned the Job Tasks Analysis document. But I think we should all
put this in the perspective that this is a first step in Energy Modeling
becoming a profession on its own. If I understand this correctly, these
classifications are used as standard job definitions for things like the
Occupational Outlook Handbook http://www.bls.gov/oco/, and to gather
statistics on energy modeling as a profession, like how many are there
in the country, what is their typical education, salaries for different
levels of experience. 

 

I am an energy modeler, much more than an architect, or a mechanical
engineer. I for one am excited that energy modeler is becoming a
stand-alone profession, rather than just a offshoot of one of the allied
professions. 

 

There may be flaws in the definition, and the process, but this kind of
marks a coming of age of our field, and I think that is kind of
exciting.

Daniel,

 

I still don't agree with your process. Your logic is flawed and most
likely so is the document. 

 

You excluded those organizations that could/will benefit from your
document for no valid reason, and you have excluded known educators in
this field, experts in the field, and other national labs. 

 

For the most part this was developed off-line, out of public review.
Hence the results of any such process cannot be trusted and the document
must be regarded as being second rate.

Please note that this email contains responses to postings by both Mr.
Haberl and Mr. Hittle.

 

Mr. Haberl:

 

The purpose of each JTA is to capture the job as currently practiced.
Such a baseline document is essential in order to fairly and objectively
identify knowledge and training gaps that exist between where any
industry is and where it "should" be.

 

As such, we went to extreme efforts ensure that psychometrically valid
sets of SMEs were selected to define the documents. Besides having to
prove that they were current practitioners in the field, applicants were
screened by a psychometrician (not DOE or NREL) using criteria such as
geographic location, years of experience, and industry credentials to
ensure that the selected group was broad with respect to all of these
criteria (this is outlined in slightly more detail in the JTAs
themselves). Bias in any one of these areas (experienced folks over
novices, people from the east coast vs. the southwest, etc.) would have
favored a particular group and skewed the resulting document in favor of
that particular group's thinking. Since we were attempting to adequately
capture the job as practiced in the U.S. (not as practiced by experts in
the U.S., or by academics in the U.S., or how it should be done
according to organization X, etc.), we wanted the broadest U.S.
representation possible. This is also why there were no international
participants.

 

Clearly, the inclusion of any professional society or organization
directly involved in the development of such a document would also skew,
whether meaning to or not, the resulting document toward the viewpoint
of said organization. Indeed, to prevent this from happening, no outside
reference materials were allowed into the workshops. Thus, the material
presented in the JTAs comes directly from the first-hand knowledge of
the participants. The resulting JTAs were all created by practitioners
detailing what it was they did in their jobs.

 

I believe that the Boulder meeting you mentioned was the BEM Innovation
Summit, which was hosted by RMI in Boulder last spring. The following is
from PDF page 36 (document page 32) of the post summit report
(http://rmi.org/Content/Files/BEM_Report_FINAL.pdf):

"Additionally, the DOE is currently sponsoring a project to develop (1)
job task analyses (JTAs), which identify and catalog all of the
activities a worker performs in a given job; and (2) the knowledge,
skills, and abilities (KSAs), which define the minimum requirements
necessary to adequately perform those tasks, for six building job
categories, including "energy modeler". The project goal is to create
"national guidelines" which will define a common body of knowledge that
any training organization will be able to draw from when developing
curriculum, helping to ensure consistent core competencies among
training programs."

 

An action item identified in that same report (PDF page 38) reads:
"Respond to Doe's RFP to develop "national guidelines" for energy
modeling education."

 

 

 

Mr. Hittle,

 

Congratulations on your recent retirement; that is one of my near-term
goals (to be accompanied by a private island though).

 

I believe that you may not have seen my previous email to Nick Caton,
which I believe (again, opinion) may answer most of the questions you
pose. If not, please feel free to let me know and I will do my best to
answer them. Like I said in my last email, this thread is getting a
little fragmented.

 

However, I can answer one of the questions you pose here. The Federal
Register notice released by DOE (
http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-10-14/pdf/2011-26645.pdf) details
the means by which they will accept public comment. While email is one
of those means, said email must be sent to a specific email address and
accompanied by a signed copy (there are other, less burdensome ways to
submit comments as well). So in response to your question, no, this
correspondence will not be officially documented as comments received on
the documents.

 

Thanks all for the lively discussion!

 

Danny

Apologies for the confusion. I had been responding previously only to
the Bldg-sim listserv, as opposed to both the Bldg-sim and IBSPA-USA

Nick,

 

Your concerns are entirely understandable, but perhaps a little
overstated. The intention with this project was to produce documents
that could be used by the corresponding sectors to improve existing, or
if necessary, create new, training/certification materials, thus leading
to a more qualified and effective workforce. If you take a look at the
job categories we targeted, I think you will see that we focused on jobs
that have a direct impact on commercial building energy use.

 

The development of specific training/certification materials however, is
being left up to the training/certification providers in each industry.
Our goal was to eliminate the heavy lift for such organizations by
facilitating the identification (by industry, not by DOE or NREL) of
what tasks were required in each job category, and what knowledge,
skills, and abilities were required to perform each of those tasks. The
idea is that organizations who have existing training/certification
programs can self-compare their program to the developed JTA to
determine if they are adequately meeting industry's needs. Or, for
industries where few training/certification programs exist,
organizations could use the developed JTAs to immediately start
developing curricula (the DACUM method is often used to create curricula
at the community college level). Through these mechanisms, the idea was
to improve the quality and amount of training available to the end-user
(in this case, the modeler), with the ultimate goal being a reduction in
real energy use at the building level.

 

Additionally, the JTAs can be used as a standardized metric of sorts to
evaluate existing training/certification programs. We are currently
working on a tool that will allow an end-user in each of the six fields
to examine what content different training/certification programs cover,
using the JTAs as a baseline (so that folks are comparing apples to
apples, instead of apples to oranges). That way, they can make a more
informed decision about where to invest their time and money when
pursuing professional development activities.

 

I do know that GSA is planning to utilize the JTAs to support efforts
related to the Federal Buildings Personnel Training Act of 2010. What
other items (new licensure/certification/PDH requirements for
government/military contracted work, etc.) will come out of this work I
cannot speak to, as those decisions are likely to be out of my control
and should they arise, will likely be made within each corresponding
organization, far from my purview.

 

I know this is another long response, and that I did not directly
address several of your questions. However, I felt that clarifying the
project purpose would actually eliminate the need for such answers. If
you feel differently let me know and I'll try to go through and provide
more specifics.

 

Thanks,

Danny

My apologies Daniel, I suddenly realized that I am so old as to be
before your time. I was project manager on the BLAST energy analysis
program and my colleague and thesis adviser, Curt Pedersen was head of
the BLAST support office and one of the project managers of EnergyPlus.
We both have been very active in ASHRAE Technical Committee 4.7, Energy
Calculations and 4.1 Load  Calculation.  I recently retired from
Colorado State University where I taught HVAC design including energy
modeling (BLAST, EnergyPlus via DesignBuilder, TRACE, TRANSIS, etc.). I
feel fortunate that a number of our former students are now your
colleagues at NREL. 

As you no doubt know, the words "certification" and "licensure exam"
(see your clarifying email) are loaded phrases in the consulting
engineering community. While most practitioners support professional
engineering exams and licensing, requirements for additional, new
certification are not likely to be widely embraced, at least not until
they can be shown to have some economic or other value. Furthermore, it
may not be enough for cognizant organizations to be aware of your JTA
work. Groups like NCEES and ASHRAE have to be early proponents of any
certification or licensing program that might result from your project.
Otherwise Republicans and Tea Partiers will claim that you are proposing
more intrusive, job-killing government regulations (be clear, I am NOT
expressing this opinion). 

Aside from the (probably) uncontroversial goals of guiding training and
education, and helping with job descriptions, what are the project goals
and expected outcomes. Are the results to be used to create an industry
standard (like standard 90)? Are parts of the work to be incorporated
into building codes? Do you hope to create a Professional Engineering
Exam for Energy Modeling? Perhaps the answer is "all of the above." The
JTA report is vague about this, perhaps intentionally. 

Just exactly why are you and your team doing this work? Who are its
proponents? What are the hoped-for impacts? Who will be affected in the
long run? I am not trying to be critical by asking these questions but
without the answers it is hard to review the report. 

Lastly, many energy modelers have a personal mantra that is not listed
in your report: "It helps to know what you are doing!" If I were hiring
that would be the main qualification.

Regards,

Doug Hittle

PS Can we all assume that these email exchanges will be considered as
qualifying comments on the report as requested by Dr. Roth?

O.K.

 

So much for me reading my email...in fact, I did indeed get this but did
nothing.

 

However, even though there was an email about this, there was no
discussion about this at the June IBPSA-USA meeting, nor was there a
request for this to be put on the agenda at the June ASHRAE meeting for
TC 4.7, Standard 140, or other committees of interest. In addition,
Charles Eley has held several conference calls (some of which I've
attended), which have discussed COMNet, yet this was not mentioned on
any of the calls I attended.

 

In addition, such documents like this, if they are coordinated with
ASHRAE, will usually be sent to RAC then to the TCs for comment, back to
RAC and then back to DOE.

 

Finally, if this effort was truly important to DOE, why are there no
other participants from the other National Labs? Why is NREL the only
lab with expertise in this area? Or for that matter, why are there no
individuals from outside the US? Or even Canada?  Seems fishy. 

 

Somehow, I still don't get a warm, friendly feeling about this.

Jeff,

The following went out on the Bldg-sim listserve in March 2011.

Also, the IBPSA Wiki known as BEMBook is mostly empty. Maybe there's
another one that I am unaware of?

Opportunity Announcement

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is currently
sponsoring a project to develop (1) job task analyses (JTAs), which
identify and catalog all of the activities a worker performs in a
given job; and (2) the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs), which
define the minimum requirements necessary for a person to adequately
perform those tasks, for the following six commercial building job
categories:

- Energy modeler
- Operating engineer/building technician
- Building energy auditor
- Energy/sustainability manager
- Commissioning/retro- 

commissioning practitioner
- Facility manager

The project goal is to create "national guidelines" which will define
a common body of knowledge that any training organization will be able
to draw from when developing curriculum, helping to bring the core
competencies imparted by training organizations to their trainees into
common alignment. This body of knowledge will also be used by the
General Services Administration and the Department of Energy to help
meet the requirements of the Federal Buildings Personnel Training Act
of 2010.

To facilitate development of the JTAs/KSAs, Professional Testing,
Inc. is seeking current industry practitioners who are interested in
helping to define, promote energy efficiency in, and support their
field of practice by participating in these JTA/KSA development
workshops. Interested individuals are invited to submit their
credentials at http://proftesting.rapidinsites.com
<http://proftesting.rapidinsites.com/> . Please note that
each JTA/KSA workshop will take place in Denver, Colorado and is
anticipated to last 3 full days (not including travel). Reimbursement
for travel costs up to a fixed amount and a travel per diem will be
awarded to individuals selected for participation. Additional project
details, including how practitioners will be selected and where to
direct project-related questions, can be found using the above link.

NREL and Professional Testing, Inc. are excited to present this unique
opportunity for individuals to have their voices heard in this
important discussion. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
The NREL Commercial Workforce Development Team

Daniel.

 

I'm afraid I can't agree that you conducted "extensive outreach" to
prepare this document. For example, there was no discussion of this,
before it happened, on any of the list servers before it came out. In
addition, there was no "call for experts" that I was aware of. Normally,
for a document like this that is sponsored by DOE, one would expect a
call of some sort through the usual list servers.

 

In addition, I noticed from your list, that there is nobody who directly
represents IBPSA-USA, nor even ASHRAE TC 4.7, which is the responsible
ASHRAE TC for energy modeling. Although there are several individuals on
the list who attend IBPSA and ASHRAE meetings and are well-known. It
seems like little was done to notify others in IBPSA-USA or ASHRAE.

 

You should know that IBPSA-USA has also worked for some time on such an
effort, which now exists as a wiki, under Joe Deringer's guidance. It
also held a workshop in Boulder, and developed the BEM exam with ASHRAE.
Yet, I see no reference to this or any of the previous efforts, nor
efforts made to contact those of us who worked on this. 

 

Finally, there are also at least a dozen or more educators within
IBPSA-USA who teach Energy Modeling at the University level, yet not one
of these individuals is mentioned in your list of contributors, only one
academic appears on your list.

 

Hence, I suggest that if DOE is serious about making this a consensus
document, then it needs to do a better job contacting the relevant
organizations to obtain input and not rely on an email response after
the fact.

 

Clearly, this is not the case with this document.

Daniel, 

 

Thank you so much for this clarification!  I have to sympathize with Mr.
Hittle in that, despite the apparent efforts to "spread the word," I too
feel somewhat unsure of what the real implications will be for myself
and my colleagues in the energy modeling world.

 

My current impression is that the results of this study will ultimately
manifest as some sort of new licensure/certification/PDH requirements
for modeling services in future LEED and/or military/government
contracted work (i.e. DoD/GSA contracts)...  does that sound right?

 

Maybe an illustration would be helpful... This is from the comment
document:

 

"JTA is traditionally used by secondary and postsecondary educators,
test developers, and business, industry, government, and military
trainers to help identify core knowledge areas, critical work functions,
and skills that are common across a representative sampling of current
practitioners."

 

Can you provide an example of what JTA's have accomplished for those
working in the above industries?  

 

For better or for worse, my concern is this study is going to add
additional layers of beauracracy to the job description... Great news
(enforced business) for those in the licensing/training industries I
suppose, but will there be a net benefit for the actual practitioners?
Are my concerns unrealistic or missing the point?

 

Thanks again for your time and efforts!

Mr. Hittle,

 

My name is Daniel Studer and I am an engineer at the National Renewable
Energy Laboratory. I also happen to be the project lead for DOE's
commercial job/task analysis development work.

 

I can assure you that we have conducted extensive outreach to ensure
that persons who operate in the spaces targeted by these JTAs are fully
aware of the work being performed, including ASHRAE.

 

The energy modeler JTA itself was created over the course of three days
by eleven practicing energy modelers who were guided through the process
by a professional psychometrician. The names and associated
organizations of each of these folks are listed at the back of the JTA,
in case you are curious. DOE and NREL had zero input into the content of
this document. And to ensure that the document is truly reflective of
the industry, DOE has decided to make the documents available for public
comment. That way, individuals such as yourself can provide DOE with
constructive feedback to ensure that the document content is both
appropriate and valid.

 

The intent of the project, as stated on the project website, is to:

Provide a basis for developing and comparing new and existing training
programs in the commercial building sector. This will help individuals
identify opportunities to enhance their professional skills, enable
industry to identify an appropriately skilled workforce, and allow
training providers to ensure that they are providing the highest quality
product possible.

 

In short, we are trying to document the job as it currently exists so
that training/certification providers can ensure that they are providing
high quality products in line with industry's identified needs.
Additionally, gathering this information using the objective approach
that we have also has the side benefit of creating a sort of baseline
document that can be used to help a training/certification end user
better understand how their current skill set and existing
training/certification options fit together.

 

I totally agree with you that items identified such as "time management
skills" are not very measurable, and in fact seem both excessive and
irrelevant, in the context of developing a training program or
certification around this material. However, such information is very
valuable in other contexts, which is why it is included in any JTA which
utilizes the "developing a curriculum" (DACUM) method. The idea is that
all aspects of the job should be documented so that the resultant
analysis can be used for multiple purposes. For example, an individual
wishing to develop a job posting may look at the JTA and include items
such as "time management skills" or "spatial skills" in the job posting.
They could then structure interview questions to better understand that
person's abilities in those areas to make a more informed decision about
a candidate.

 

In other JTAs that were developed under this project, SMEs also
identified physical attributes necessary to perform the job (e.g., lift
X lbs over head, see X feet). While these may also seem silly, they
become very important when developing high risk assessments, such as
licensure exams, in these spaces.

 

The real meat of each document is the DACUM chart located at the back of
each. These charts identify the specific domain areas, tasks, and steps
that the SMEs identified were necessary to perform the specified job. It
is this content specifically that is of most use to
training/certification providers, which is why DOE asked for comments on
this specific chart in the Federal Register notice.

 

The proposed content blueprint tables (located near the front of each
document), contain the SME's proposed weights for how often, and how
important, each of the identified tasks is to the job. Such weights
provide valuable context to training/certification providers by serving
as guidelines for how much time should be devoted to each topic.

 

As part of this project, NREL will be facilitating a "survey validation"
which will provide industry with the opportunity to adjust these
weighting factors. However, to avoid the confusion that would occur with
two "comment periods" occurring at once, this will not happen until
DOE's public comment closes at the end of November.

 

Please feel free to contact me if you have any additional questions.

 

Thanks,

Danny

I would like to be grandfathered in please. Who is scrutinizing this
document (proposed regulation?) at ASHRAE headquarters? Have you had any
input from ASHRAE?

If you were to do a jta for President of the United States it might not
be so lengthy as the one for building energy modelers. (And, a lot of
folks in the current primary would be automatically excluded). Is it
possible that we have the cart before the horse? Perhaps we need a jta
for building architects and building design engineers of which energy
modelers could be a subset.  I am sure that if DOE proposed a regulatory
test procedure for architects and engineers there would be plenty of
comment. 

I've looked at the document. What caught my attentions was the list of
"skills and abilities." These included such thing as "time management
skills," "critical thinking," and  "spatial skills."  Assuming that the
goal is to define measurable skills, we might want to give energy
modeler want-a-be s the SAT again. 

Then I saw "common sense" and "patience" as skills and abilities. Now,
not withstanding the jta, I consider myself a competent modeler of
buildings and their energy systems. We don't need to vote on that but I
also am reasonably sure that "patience" has only recently kicked in as a
personal skill (maybe I am being optimistic). How are we going to
measure the "common sense" of someone who wants to apply to be an energy
modeler?

Dr. Roth, it is not clear that very many in the building sciences field
are aware of your project, its history, and potential impact. Perhaps
you could get on the agenda at an upcoming ASHRAE meeting and explain
the process and your intent for the project outcomes.

Respectfully,
Doug Hittle

Agreed! The term "Energy Modeler" at this point has always been loosey
goosey and has only recently become more popular due to LEED (as much as
I hate to give USGBC credit haha)

 

Creating a standard "position" will be good long term to develop more
awareness of what skills we bring. In fact, I'd rather us be called
"Building Analyst" rather than Energy Modeler. Our skills and job go
beyond just "modeling", I think. We help analyze buildings whether for
energy, costs, etc.! I see project managers bringing together and
leading the resource side of things and a "Building Analyst" bringing
together the technical side of things (helping analyze architect's
decision on glazing, walls or mech engineers HVAC systems, etc. etc.)

 

Hope the morning writeup wasn't too confusing, having had a cup of
coffee yet!!

All,

 

I was reading all of these emails this morning and I will admit, I've
only scanned the Job Tasks Analysis document. But I think we should all
put this in the perspective that this is a first step in Energy Modeling
becoming a profession on its own. If I understand this correctly, these
classifications are used as standard job definitions for things like the
Occupational Outlook Handbook http://www.bls.gov/oco/, and to gather
statistics on energy modeling as a profession, like how many are there
in the country, what is their typical education, salaries for different
levels of experience. 

 

I am an energy modeler, much more than an architect, or a mechanical
engineer. I for one am excited that energy modeler is becoming a
stand-alone profession, rather than just a offshoot of one of the allied
professions. 

 

There may be flaws in the definition, and the process, but this kind of
marks a coming of age of our field, and I think that is kind of
exciting.

Daniel,

 

I still don't agree with your process. Your logic is flawed and most
likely so is the document. 

 

You excluded those organizations that could/will benefit from your
document for no valid reason, and you have excluded known educators in
this field, experts in the field, and other national labs. 

 

For the most part this was developed off-line, out of public review.
Hence the results of any such process cannot be trusted and the document
must be regarded as being second rate.

Please note that this email contains responses to postings by both Mr.
Haberl and Mr. Hittle.

 

Mr. Haberl:

 

The purpose of each JTA is to capture the job as currently practiced.
Such a baseline document is essential in order to fairly and objectively
identify knowledge and training gaps that exist between where any
industry is and where it "should" be.

 

As such, we went to extreme efforts ensure that psychometrically valid
sets of SMEs were selected to define the documents. Besides having to
prove that they were current practitioners in the field, applicants were
screened by a psychometrician (not DOE or NREL) using criteria such as
geographic location, years of experience, and industry credentials to
ensure that the selected group was broad with respect to all of these
criteria (this is outlined in slightly more detail in the JTAs
themselves). Bias in any one of these areas (experienced folks over
novices, people from the east coast vs. the southwest, etc.) would have
favored a particular group and skewed the resulting document in favor of
that particular group's thinking. Since we were attempting to adequately
capture the job as practiced in the U.S. (not as practiced by experts in
the U.S., or by academics in the U.S., or how it should be done
according to organization X, etc.), we wanted the broadest U.S.
representation possible. This is also why there were no international
participants.

 

Clearly, the inclusion of any professional society or organization
directly involved in the development of such a document would also skew,
whether meaning to or not, the resulting document toward the viewpoint
of said organization. Indeed, to prevent this from happening, no outside
reference materials were allowed into the workshops. Thus, the material
presented in the JTAs comes directly from the first-hand knowledge of
the participants. The resulting JTAs were all created by practitioners
detailing what it was they did in their jobs.

 

I believe that the Boulder meeting you mentioned was the BEM Innovation
Summit, which was hosted by RMI in Boulder last spring. The following is
from PDF page 36 (document page 32) of the post summit report
(http://rmi.org/Content/Files/BEM_Report_FINAL.pdf):

"Additionally, the DOE is currently sponsoring a project to develop (1)
job task analyses (JTAs), which identify and catalog all of the
activities a worker performs in a given job; and (2) the knowledge,
skills, and abilities (KSAs), which define the minimum requirements
necessary to adequately perform those tasks, for six building job
categories, including "energy modeler". The project goal is to create
"national guidelines" which will define a common body of knowledge that
any training organization will be able to draw from when developing
curriculum, helping to ensure consistent core competencies among
training programs."

 

An action item identified in that same report (PDF page 38) reads:
"Respond to Doe's RFP to develop "national guidelines" for energy
modeling education."

 

 

 

Mr. Hittle,

 

Congratulations on your recent retirement; that is one of my near-term
goals (to be accompanied by a private island though).

 

I believe that you may not have seen my previous email to Nick Caton,
which I believe (again, opinion) may answer most of the questions you
pose. If not, please feel free to let me know and I will do my best to
answer them. Like I said in my last email, this thread is getting a
little fragmented.

 

However, I can answer one of the questions you pose here. The Federal
Register notice released by DOE (
http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-10-14/pdf/2011-26645.pdf) details
the means by which they will accept public comment. While email is one
of those means, said email must be sent to a specific email address and
accompanied by a signed copy (there are other, less burdensome ways to
submit comments as well). So in response to your question, no, this
correspondence will not be officially documented as comments received on
the documents.

 

Thanks all for the lively discussion!

All,

 

Apologies for the confusion. I had been responding previously only to
the Bldg-sim listserv, as opposed to both the Bldg-sim and IBSPA-USA
listservs. Below is my response earlier this evening to Nick Caton's
email inquiry (again, sent only to the Bldg-sim listserv). Also, since
things seemed to be quickly fragmenting, I have attempted to paste below
all emails on this topic, so that everyone can easily reference them. I
will follow up to the two most recent emails in a separate posting so
that others may follow the conversation more easily.

 

Thanks,

Danny

Nick,

 

Your concerns are entirely understandable, but perhaps a little
overstated. The intention with this project was to produce documents
that could be used by the corresponding sectors to improve existing, or
if necessary, create new, training/certification materials, thus leading
to a more qualified and effective workforce. If you take a look at the
job categories we targeted, I think you will see that we focused on jobs
that have a direct impact on commercial building energy use.

 

The development of specific training/certification materials however, is
being left up to the training/certification providers in each industry.
Our goal was to eliminate the heavy lift for such organizations by
facilitating the identification (by industry, not by DOE or NREL) of
what tasks were required in each job category, and what knowledge,
skills, and abilities were required to perform each of those tasks. The
idea is that organizations who have existing training/certification
programs can self-compare their program to the developed JTA to
determine if they are adequately meeting industry's needs. Or, for
industries where few training/certification programs exist,
organizations could use the developed JTAs to immediately start
developing curricula (the DACUM method is often used to create curricula
at the community college level). Through these mechanisms, the idea was
to improve the quality and amount of training available to the end-user
(in this case, the modeler), with the ultimate goal being a reduction in
real energy use at the building level.

 

Additionally, the JTAs can be used as a standardized metric of sorts to
evaluate existing training/certification programs. We are currently
working on a tool that will allow an end-user in each of the six fields
to examine what content different training/certification programs cover,
using the JTAs as a baseline (so that folks are comparing apples to
apples, instead of apples to oranges). That way, they can make a more
informed decision about where to invest their time and money when
pursuing professional development activities.

 

I do know that GSA is planning to utilize the JTAs to support efforts
related to the Federal Buildings Personnel Training Act of 2010. What
other items (new licensure/certification/PDH requirements for
government/military contracted work, etc.) will come out of this work I
cannot speak to, as those decisions are likely to be out of my control
and should they arise, will likely be made within each corresponding
organization, far from my purview.

 

I know this is another long response, and that I did not directly
address several of your questions. However, I felt that clarifying the
project purpose would actually eliminate the need for such answers. If
you feel differently let me know and I'll try to go through and provide
more specifics.

 

Thanks,

Danny

My apologies Daniel, I suddenly realized that I am so old as to be
before your time. I was project manager on the BLAST energy analysis
program and my colleague and thesis adviser, Curt Pedersen was head of
the BLAST support office and one of the project managers of EnergyPlus.
We both have been very active in ASHRAE Technical Committee 4.7, Energy
Calculations and 4.1 Load  Calculation.  I recently retired from
Colorado State University where I taught HVAC design including energy
modeling (BLAST, EnergyPlus via DesignBuilder, TRACE, TRANSIS, etc.). I
feel fortunate that a number of our former students are now your
colleagues at NREL. 

As you no doubt know, the words "certification" and "licensure exam"
(see your clarifying email) are loaded phrases in the consulting
engineering community. While most practitioners support professional
engineering exams and licensing, requirements for additional, new
certification are not likely to be widely embraced, at least not until
they can be shown to have some economic or other value. Furthermore, it
may not be enough for cognizant organizations to be aware of your JTA
work. Groups like NCEES and ASHRAE have to be early proponents of any
certification or licensing program that might result from your project.
Otherwise Republicans and Tea Partiers will claim that you are proposing
more intrusive, job-killing government regulations (be clear, I am NOT
expressing this opinion). 

Aside from the (probably) uncontroversial goals of guiding training and
education, and helping with job descriptions, what are the project goals
and expected outcomes. Are the results to be used to create an industry
standard (like standard 90)? Are parts of the work to be incorporated
into building codes? Do you hope to create a Professional Engineering
Exam for Energy Modeling? Perhaps the answer is "all of the above." The
JTA report is vague about this, perhaps intentionally. 

Just exactly why are you and your team doing this work? Who are its
proponents? What are the hoped-for impacts? Who will be affected in the
long run? I am not trying to be critical by asking these questions but
without the answers it is hard to review the report. 

Lastly, many energy modelers have a personal mantra that is not listed
in your report: "It helps to know what you are doing!" If I were hiring
that would be the main qualification.

Regards,

Doug Hittle

PS Can we all assume that these email exchanges will be considered as
qualifying comments on the report as requested by Dr. Roth?

O.K.

 

So much for me reading my email...in fact, I did indeed get this but did
nothing.

 

However, even though there was an email about this, there was no
discussion about this at the June IBPSA-USA meeting, nor was there a
request for this to be put on the agenda at the June ASHRAE meeting for
TC 4.7, Standard 140, or other committees of interest. In addition,
Charles Eley has held several conference calls (some of which I've
attended), which have discussed COMNet, yet this was not mentioned on
any of the calls I attended.

 

In addition, such documents like this, if they are coordinated with
ASHRAE, will usually be sent to RAC then to the TCs for comment, back to
RAC and then back to DOE.

 

Finally, if this effort was truly important to DOE, why are there no
other participants from the other National Labs? Why is NREL the only
lab with expertise in this area? Or for that matter, why are there no
individuals from outside the US? Or even Canada?  Seems fishy. 

 

Somehow, I still don't get a warm, friendly feeling about this.

 

Jeff

Jeff,

The following went out on the Bldg-sim listserve in March 2011.

Also, the IBPSA Wiki known as BEMBook is mostly empty. Maybe there's
another one that I am unaware of?

Opportunity Announcement

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is currently
sponsoring a project to develop (1) job task analyses (JTAs), which
identify and catalog all of the activities a worker performs in a
given job; and (2) the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs), which
define the minimum requirements necessary for a person to adequately
perform those tasks, for the following six commercial building job
categories:

- Energy modeler
- Operating engineer/building technician
- Building energy auditor
- Energy/sustainability manager
- Commissioning/retro- 

commissioning practitioner
- Facility manager

The project goal is to create "national guidelines" which will define
a common body of knowledge that any training organization will be able
to draw from when developing curriculum, helping to bring the core
competencies imparted by training organizations to their trainees into
common alignment. This body of knowledge will also be used by the
General Services Administration and the Department of Energy to help
meet the requirements of the Federal Buildings Personnel Training Act
of 2010.

To facilitate development of the JTAs/KSAs, Professional Testing,
Inc. is seeking current industry practitioners who are interested in
helping to define, promote energy efficiency in, and support their
field of practice by participating in these JTA/KSA development
workshops. Interested individuals are invited to submit their
credentials at http://proftesting.rapidinsites.com
<http://proftesting.rapidinsites.com/> . Please note that
each JTA/KSA workshop will take place in Denver, Colorado and is
anticipated to last 3 full days (not including travel). Reimbursement
for travel costs up to a fixed amount and a travel per diem will be
awarded to individuals selected for participation. Additional project
details, including how practitioners will be selected and where to
direct project-related questions, can be found using the above link.

NREL and Professional Testing, Inc. are excited to present this unique
opportunity for individuals to have their voices heard in this
important discussion. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
The NREL Commercial Workforce Development Team

Daniel.

 

I'm afraid I can't agree that you conducted "extensive outreach" to
prepare this document. For example, there was no discussion of this,
before it happened, on any of the list servers before it came out. In
addition, there was no "call for experts" that I was aware of. Normally,
for a document like this that is sponsored by DOE, one would expect a
call of some sort through the usual list servers.

 

In addition, I noticed from your list, that there is nobody who directly
represents IBPSA-USA, nor even ASHRAE TC 4.7, which is the responsible
ASHRAE TC for energy modeling. Although there are several individuals on
the list who attend IBPSA and ASHRAE meetings and are well-known. It
seems like little was done to notify others in IBPSA-USA or ASHRAE.

 

You should know that IBPSA-USA has also worked for some time on such an
effort, which now exists as a wiki, under Joe Deringer's guidance. It
also held a workshop in Boulder, and developed the BEM exam with ASHRAE.
Yet, I see no reference to this or any of the previous efforts, nor
efforts made to contact those of us who worked on this. 

 

Finally, there are also at least a dozen or more educators within
IBPSA-USA who teach Energy Modeling at the University level, yet not one
of these individuals is mentioned in your list of contributors, only one
academic appears on your list.

 

Hence, I suggest that if DOE is serious about making this a consensus
document, then it needs to do a better job contacting the relevant
organizations to obtain input and not rely on an email response after
the fact.

 

Clearly, this is not the case with this document.

 

Jeff

Daniel, 

 

Thank you so much for this clarification!  I have to sympathize with Mr.
Hittle in that, despite the apparent efforts to "spread the word," I too
feel somewhat unsure of what the real implications will be for myself
and my colleagues in the energy modeling world.

 

My current impression is that the results of this study will ultimately
manifest as some sort of new licensure/certification/PDH requirements
for modeling services in future LEED and/or military/government
contracted work (i.e. DoD/GSA contracts)...  does that sound right?

 

Maybe an illustration would be helpful... This is from the comment
document:

 

"JTA is traditionally used by secondary and postsecondary educators,
test developers, and business, industry, government, and military
trainers to help identify core knowledge areas, critical work functions,
and skills that are common across a representative sampling of current
practitioners."

 

Can you provide an example of what JTA's have accomplished for those
working in the above industries?  

 

For better or for worse, my concern is this study is going to add
additional layers of beauracracy to the job description... Great news
(enforced business) for those in the licensing/training industries I
suppose, but will there be a net benefit for the actual practitioners?
Are my concerns unrealistic or missing the point?

 

Thanks again for your time and efforts!

Mr. Hittle,

 

My name is Daniel Studer and I am an engineer at the National Renewable
Energy Laboratory. I also happen to be the project lead for DOE's
commercial job/task analysis development work.

 

I can assure you that we have conducted extensive outreach to ensure
that persons who operate in the spaces targeted by these JTAs are fully
aware of the work being performed, including ASHRAE.

 

The energy modeler JTA itself was created over the course of three days
by eleven practicing energy modelers who were guided through the process
by a professional psychometrician. The names and associated
organizations of each of these folks are listed at the back of the JTA,
in case you are curious. DOE and NREL had zero input into the content of
this document. And to ensure that the document is truly reflective of
the industry, DOE has decided to make the documents available for public
comment. That way, individuals such as yourself can provide DOE with
constructive feedback to ensure that the document content is both
appropriate and valid.

 

The intent of the project, as stated on the project website, is to:

Provide a basis for developing and comparing new and existing training
programs in the commercial building sector. This will help individuals
identify opportunities to enhance their professional skills, enable
industry to identify an appropriately skilled workforce, and allow
training providers to ensure that they are providing the highest quality
product possible.

 

In short, we are trying to document the job as it currently exists so
that training/certification providers can ensure that they are providing
high quality products in line with industry's identified needs.
Additionally, gathering this information using the objective approach
that we have also has the side benefit of creating a sort of baseline
document that can be used to help a training/certification end user
better understand how their current skill set and existing
training/certification options fit together.

 

I totally agree with you that items identified such as "time management
skills" are not very measurable, and in fact seem both excessive and
irrelevant, in the context of developing a training program or
certification around this material. However, such information is very
valuable in other contexts, which is why it is included in any JTA which
utilizes the "developing a curriculum" (DACUM) method. The idea is that
all aspects of the job should be documented so that the resultant
analysis can be used for multiple purposes. For example, an individual
wishing to develop a job posting may look at the JTA and include items
such as "time management skills" or "spatial skills" in the job posting.
They could then structure interview questions to better understand that
person's abilities in those areas to make a more informed decision about
a candidate.

 

In other JTAs that were developed under this project, SMEs also
identified physical attributes necessary to perform the job (e.g., lift
X lbs over head, see X feet). While these may also seem silly, they
become very important when developing high risk assessments, such as
licensure exams, in these spaces.

 

The real meat of each document is the DACUM chart located at the back of
each. These charts identify the specific domain areas, tasks, and steps
that the SMEs identified were necessary to perform the specified job. It
is this content specifically that is of most use to
training/certification providers, which is why DOE asked for comments on
this specific chart in the Federal Register notice.

 

The proposed content blueprint tables (located near the front of each
document), contain the SME's proposed weights for how often, and how
important, each of the identified tasks is to the job. Such weights
provide valuable context to training/certification providers by serving
as guidelines for how much time should be devoted to each topic.

 

As part of this project, NREL will be facilitating a "survey validation"
which will provide industry with the opportunity to adjust these
weighting factors. However, to avoid the confusion that would occur with
two "comment periods" occurring at once, this will not happen until
DOE's public comment closes at the end of November.

 

Please feel free to contact me if you have any additional questions.

 

Thanks,

Danny

I would like to be grandfathered in please. Who is scrutinizing this
document (proposed regulation?) at ASHRAE headquarters? Have you had any
input from ASHRAE?

If you were to do a jta for President of the United States it might not
be so lengthy as the one for building energy modelers. (And, a lot of
folks in the current primary would be automatically excluded). Is it
possible that we have the cart before the horse? Perhaps we need a jta
for building architects and building design engineers of which energy
modelers could be a subset.  I am sure that if DOE proposed a regulatory
test procedure for architects and engineers there would be plenty of
comment. 

I've looked at the document. What caught my attentions was the list of
"skills and abilities." These included such thing as "time management
skills," "critical thinking," and  "spatial skills."  Assuming that the
goal is to define measurable skills, we might want to give energy
modeler want-a-be s the SAT again. 

Then I saw "common sense" and "patience" as skills and abilities. Now,
not withstanding the jta, I consider myself a competent modeler of
buildings and their energy systems. We don't need to vote on that but I
also am reasonably sure that "patience" has only recently kicked in as a
personal skill (maybe I am being optimistic). How are we going to
measure the "common sense" of someone who wants to apply to be an energy
modeler?

Dr. Roth, it is not clear that very many in the building sciences field
are aware of your project, its history, and potential impact. Perhaps
you could get on the agenda at an upcoming ASHRAE meeting and explain
the process and your intent for the project outcomes.

Respectfully,
Doug Hittle

I thought BEMP was the first step to make energy modeling a profession of
its own? Hasn't ASHRAE already analyzed the required skill set, work
experience, and education when developing the test?  I work with several
large incentive programs in north east, and was planning to push for making
BEMP mandatory for modelers working in the programs. DOE Job Task Analysis
project will weaken my chances of succeeding, because I can see
administrators delaying the decision in expectation that some alternative,
better certification will come out. Modelers may defer taking BEMP for this
same reasons.  If DOE document has to be released, I think it is very
important that it acknowledges the related prior work, and clearly defines
where this parallel effort fits in.

All,

 

I was reading all of these emails this morning and I will admit, I've only
scanned the Job Tasks Analysis document. But I think we should all put this
in the perspective that this is a first step in Energy Modeling becoming a
profession on its own. If I understand this correctly, these classifications
are used as standard job definitions for things like the Occupational
Outlook Handbook http://www.bls.gov/oco/, and to gather statistics on energy
modeling as a profession, like how many are there in the country, what is
their typical education, salaries for different levels of experience. 

 

I am an energy modeler, much more than an architect, or a mechanical
engineer. I for one am excited that energy modeler is becoming a stand-alone
profession, rather than just a offshoot of one of the allied professions. 

 

There may be flaws in the definition, and the process, but this kind of
marks a coming of age of our field, and I think that is kind of exciting.

Daniel,

 

I still don't agree with your process. Your logic is flawed and most likely
so is the document. 

 

You excluded those organizations that could/will benefit from your document
for no valid reason, and you have excluded known educators in this field,
experts in the field, and other national labs. 

 

For the most part this was developed off-line, out of public review. Hence
the results of any such process cannot be trusted and the document must be
regarded as being second rate.

Please note that this email contains responses to postings by both Mr.
Haberl and Mr. Hittle.

 

Mr. Haberl:

 

The purpose of each JTA is to capture the job as currently practiced. Such a
baseline document is essential in order to fairly and objectively identify
knowledge and training gaps that exist between where any industry is and
where it "should" be.

 

As such, we went to extreme efforts ensure that psychometrically valid sets
of SMEs were selected to define the documents. Besides having to prove that
they were current practitioners in the field, applicants were screened by a
psychometrician (not DOE or NREL) using criteria such as geographic
location, years of experience, and industry credentials to ensure that the
selected group was broad with respect to all of these criteria (this is
outlined in slightly more detail in the JTAs themselves). Bias in any one of
these areas (experienced folks over novices, people from the east coast vs.
the southwest, etc.) would have favored a particular group and skewed the
resulting document in favor of that particular group's thinking. Since we
were attempting to adequately capture the job as practiced in the U.S. (not
as practiced by experts in the U.S., or by academics in the U.S., or how it
should be done according to organization X, etc.), we wanted the broadest
U.S. representation possible. This is also why there were no international
participants.

 

Clearly, the inclusion of any professional society or organization directly
involved in the development of such a document would also skew, whether
meaning to or not, the resulting document toward the viewpoint of said
organization. Indeed, to prevent this from happening, no outside reference
materials were allowed into the workshops. Thus, the material presented in
the JTAs comes directly from the first-hand knowledge of the participants.
The resulting JTAs were all created by practitioners detailing what it was
they did in their jobs.

 

I believe that the Boulder meeting you mentioned was the BEM Innovation
Summit, which was hosted by RMI in Boulder last spring. The following is
from PDF page 36 (document page 32) of the post summit report
(http://rmi.org/Content/Files/BEM_Report_FINAL.pdf):

"Additionally, the DOE is currently sponsoring a project to develop (1) job
task analyses (JTAs), which identify and catalog all of the activities a
worker performs in a given job; and (2) the knowledge, skills, and abilities
(KSAs), which define the minimum requirements necessary to adequately
perform those tasks, for six building job categories, including "energy
modeler". The project goal is to create "national guidelines" which will
define a common body of knowledge that any training organization will be
able to draw from when developing curriculum, helping to ensure consistent
core competencies among training programs."

 

An action item identified in that same report (PDF page 38) reads: "Respond
to Doe's RFP to develop "national guidelines" for energy modeling
education."

 

 

 

Mr. Hittle,

 

Congratulations on your recent retirement; that is one of my near-term goals
(to be accompanied by a private island though).

 

I believe that you may not have seen my previous email to Nick Caton, which
I believe (again, opinion) may answer most of the questions you pose. If
not, please feel free to let me know and I will do my best to answer them.
Like I said in my last email, this thread is getting a little fragmented.

 

However, I can answer one of the questions you pose here. The Federal
Register notice released by DOE
(http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-10-14/pdf/2011-26645.pdf) details the
means by which they will accept public comment. While email is one of those
means, said email must be sent to a specific email address and accompanied
by a signed copy (there are other, less burdensome ways to submit comments
as well). So in response to your question, no, this correspondence will not
be officially documented as comments received on the documents.

 

Thanks all for the lively discussion!

 

Danny

All,

 

Apologies for the confusion. I had been responding previously only to the
Bldg-sim listserv, as opposed to both the Bldg-sim and IBSPA-USA listservs.
Below is my response earlier this evening to Nick Caton's email inquiry
(again, sent only to the Bldg-sim listserv). Also, since things seemed to be
quickly fragmenting, I have attempted to paste below all emails on this
topic, so that everyone can easily reference them. I will follow up to the
two most recent emails in a separate posting so that others may follow the
conversation more easily.

 

Thanks,

Nick,

 

Your concerns are entirely understandable, but perhaps a little overstated.
The intention with this project was to produce documents that could be used
by the corresponding sectors to improve existing, or if necessary, create
new, training/certification materials, thus leading to a more qualified and
effective workforce. If you take a look at the job categories we targeted, I
think you will see that we focused on jobs that have a direct impact on
commercial building energy use.

 

The development of specific training/certification materials however, is
being left up to the training/certification providers in each industry. Our
goal was to eliminate the heavy lift for such organizations by facilitating
the identification (by industry, not by DOE or NREL) of what tasks were
required in each job category, and what knowledge, skills, and abilities
were required to perform each of those tasks. The idea is that organizations
who have existing training/certification programs can self-compare their
program to the developed JTA to determine if they are adequately meeting
industry's needs. Or, for industries where few training/certification
programs exist, organizations could use the developed JTAs to immediately
start developing curricula (the DACUM method is often used to create
curricula at the community college level). Through these mechanisms, the
idea was to improve the quality and amount of training available to the
end-user (in this case, the modeler), with the ultimate goal being a
reduction in real energy use at the building level.

 

Additionally, the JTAs can be used as a standardized metric of sorts to
evaluate existing training/certification programs. We are currently working
on a tool that will allow an end-user in each of the six fields to examine
what content different training/certification programs cover, using the JTAs
as a baseline (so that folks are comparing apples to apples, instead of
apples to oranges). That way, they can make a more informed decision about
where to invest their time and money when pursuing professional development
activities.

 

I do know that GSA is planning to utilize the JTAs to support efforts
related to the Federal Buildings Personnel Training Act of 2010. What other
items (new licensure/certification/PDH requirements for government/military
contracted work, etc.) will come out of this work I cannot speak to, as
those decisions are likely to be out of my control and should they arise,
will likely be made within each corresponding organization, far from my
purview.

 

I know this is another long response, and that I did not directly address
several of your questions. However, I felt that clarifying the project
purpose would actually eliminate the need for such answers. If you feel
differently let me know and I'll try to go through and provide more
specifics.

 

Thanks,

Danny

My apologies Daniel, I suddenly realized that I am so old as to be before
your time. I was project manager on the BLAST energy analysis program and my
colleague and thesis adviser, Curt Pedersen was head of the BLAST support
office and one of the project managers of EnergyPlus. We both have been very
active in ASHRAE Technical Committee 4.7, Energy Calculations and 4.1 Load
Calculation.  I recently retired from Colorado State University where I
taught HVAC design including energy modeling (BLAST, EnergyPlus via
DesignBuilder, TRACE, TRANSIS, etc.). I feel fortunate that a number of our
former students are now your colleagues at NREL. 

As you no doubt know, the words "certification" and "licensure exam" (see
your clarifying email) are loaded phrases in the consulting engineering
community. While most practitioners support professional engineering exams
and licensing, requirements for additional, new certification are not likely
to be widely embraced, at least not until they can be shown to have some
economic or other value. Furthermore, it may not be enough for cognizant
organizations to be aware of your JTA work. Groups like NCEES and ASHRAE
have to be early proponents of any certification or licensing program that
might result from your project. Otherwise Republicans and Tea Partiers will
claim that you are proposing more intrusive, job-killing government
regulations (be clear, I am NOT expressing this opinion). 

Aside from the (probably) uncontroversial goals of guiding training and
education, and helping with job descriptions, what are the project goals and
expected outcomes. Are the results to be used to create an industry standard
(like standard 90)? Are parts of the work to be incorporated into building
codes? Do you hope to create a Professional Engineering Exam for Energy
Modeling? Perhaps the answer is "all of the above." The JTA report is vague
about this, perhaps intentionally. 

Just exactly why are you and your team doing this work? Who are its
proponents? What are the hoped-for impacts? Who will be affected in the long
run? I am not trying to be critical by asking these questions but without
the answers it is hard to review the report. 

Lastly, many energy modelers have a personal mantra that is not listed in
your report: "It helps to know what you are doing!" If I were hiring that
would be the main qualification.

Regards,

Doug Hittle

PS Can we all assume that these email exchanges will be considered as
qualifying comments on the report as requested by Dr. Roth?

O.K.

 

So much for me reading my email...in fact, I did indeed get this but did
nothing.

 

However, even though there was an email about this, there was no discussion
about this at the June IBPSA-USA meeting, nor was there a request for this
to be put on the agenda at the June ASHRAE meeting for TC 4.7, Standard 140,
or other committees of interest. In addition, Charles Eley has held several
conference calls (some of which I've attended), which have discussed COMNet,
yet this was not mentioned on any of the calls I attended.

 

In addition, such documents like this, if they are coordinated with ASHRAE,
will usually be sent to RAC then to the TCs for comment, back to RAC and
then back to DOE.

 

Finally, if this effort was truly important to DOE, why are there no other
participants from the other National Labs? Why is NREL the only lab with
expertise in this area? Or for that matter, why are there no individuals
from outside the US? Or even Canada?  Seems fishy. 

 

Somehow, I still don't get a warm, friendly feeling about this.

Also, the IBPSA Wiki known as BEMBook is mostly empty. Maybe there's another

Opportunity Announcement

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is currently
sponsoring a project to develop (1) job task analyses (JTAs), which
identify and catalog all of the activities a worker performs in a
given job; and (2) the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs), which
define the minimum requirements necessary for a person to adequately
perform those tasks, for the following six commercial building job
categories:

- Energy modeler
- Operating engineer/building technician
- Building energy auditor
- Energy/sustainability manager
- Commissioning/retro- 

commissioning practitioner
- Facility manager

The project goal is to create "national guidelines" which will define
a common body of knowledge that any training organization will be able
to draw from when developing curriculum, helping to bring the core
competencies imparted by training organizations to their trainees into
common alignment. This body of knowledge will also be used by the
General Services Administration and the Department of Energy to help
meet the requirements of the Federal Buildings Personnel Training Act
of 2010.

To facilitate development of the JTAs/KSAs, Professional Testing,
Inc. is seeking current industry practitioners who are interested in
helping to define, promote energy efficiency in, and support their
field of practice by participating in these JTA/KSA development
workshops. Interested individuals are invited to submit their
credentials at http://proftesting.rapidinsites.com
<http://proftesting.rapidinsites.com/> . Please note that
each JTA/KSA workshop will take place in Denver, Colorado and is
anticipated to last 3 full days (not including travel). Reimbursement
for travel costs up to a fixed amount and a travel per diem will be
awarded to individuals selected for participation. Additional project
details, including how practitioners will be selected and where to
direct project-related questions, can be found using the above link.

NREL and Professional Testing, Inc. are excited to present this unique
opportunity for individuals to have their voices heard in this
important discussion. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
The NREL Commercial Workforce Development Team

Daniel.

 

I'm afraid I can't agree that you conducted "extensive outreach" to prepare
this document. For example, there was no discussion of this, before it
happened, on any of the list servers before it came out. In addition, there
was no "call for experts" that I was aware of. Normally, for a document like
this that is sponsored by DOE, one would expect a call of some sort through
the usual list servers.

 

In addition, I noticed from your list, that there is nobody who directly
represents IBPSA-USA, nor even ASHRAE TC 4.7, which is the responsible
ASHRAE TC for energy modeling. Although there are several individuals on the
list who attend IBPSA and ASHRAE meetings and are well-known. It seems like
little was done to notify others in IBPSA-USA or ASHRAE.

 

You should know that IBPSA-USA has also worked for some time on such an
effort, which now exists as a wiki, under Joe Deringer's guidance. It also
held a workshop in Boulder, and developed the BEM exam with ASHRAE. Yet, I
see no reference to this or any of the previous efforts, nor efforts made to
contact those of us who worked on this. 

 

Finally, there are also at least a dozen or more educators within IBPSA-USA
who teach Energy Modeling at the University level, yet not one of these
individuals is mentioned in your list of contributors, only one academic
appears on your list.

 

Hence, I suggest that if DOE is serious about making this a consensus
document, then it needs to do a better job contacting the relevant
organizations to obtain input and not rely on an email response after the
fact.

 

Clearly, this is not the case with this document.

Daniel, 

 

Thank you so much for this clarification!  I have to sympathize with Mr.
Hittle in that, despite the apparent efforts to "spread the word," I too
feel somewhat unsure of what the real implications will be for myself and my
colleagues in the energy modeling world.

 

My current impression is that the results of this study will ultimately
manifest as some sort of new licensure/certification/PDH requirements for
modeling services in future LEED and/or military/government contracted work
(i.e. DoD/GSA contracts).  does that sound right?

 

Maybe an illustration would be helpful. This is from the comment document:

 

"JTA is traditionally used by secondary and postsecondary educators, test
developers, and business, industry, government, and military trainers to
help identify core knowledge areas, critical work functions, and skills that
are common across a representative sampling of current practitioners."

 

Can you provide an example of what JTA's have accomplished for those working
in the above industries?  

 

For better or for worse, my concern is this study is going to add additional
layers of beauracracy to the job description. Great news (enforced business)
for those in the licensing/training industries I suppose, but will there be
a net benefit for the actual practitioners?  Are my concerns unrealistic or
missing the point?

 

Thanks again for your time and efforts!

Mr. Hittle,

 

My name is Daniel Studer and I am an engineer at the National Renewable
Energy Laboratory. I also happen to be the project lead for DOE's commercial
job/task analysis development work.

 

I can assure you that we have conducted extensive outreach to ensure that
persons who operate in the spaces targeted by these JTAs are fully aware of
the work being performed, including ASHRAE.

 

The energy modeler JTA itself was created over the course of three days by
eleven practicing energy modelers who were guided through the process by a
professional psychometrician. The names and associated organizations of each
of these folks are listed at the back of the JTA, in case you are curious.
DOE and NREL had zero input into the content of this document. And to ensure
that the document is truly reflective of the industry, DOE has decided to
make the documents available for public comment. That way, individuals such
as yourself can provide DOE with constructive feedback to ensure that the
document content is both appropriate and valid.

 

The intent of the project, as stated on the project website, is to:

Provide a basis for developing and comparing new and existing training
programs in the commercial building sector. This will help individuals
identify opportunities to enhance their professional skills, enable industry
to identify an appropriately skilled workforce, and allow training providers
to ensure that they are providing the highest quality product possible.

 

In short, we are trying to document the job as it currently exists so that
training/certification providers can ensure that they are providing high
quality products in line with industry's identified needs. Additionally,
gathering this information using the objective approach that we have also
has the side benefit of creating a sort of baseline document that can be
used to help a training/certification end user better understand how their
current skill set and existing training/certification options fit together.

 

I totally agree with you that items identified such as "time management
skills" are not very measurable, and in fact seem both excessive and
irrelevant, in the context of developing a training program or certification
around this material. However, such information is very valuable in other
contexts, which is why it is included in any JTA which utilizes the
"developing a curriculum" (DACUM) method. The idea is that all aspects of
the job should be documented so that the resultant analysis can be used for
multiple purposes. For example, an individual wishing to develop a job
posting may look at the JTA and include items such as "time management
skills" or "spatial skills" in the job posting. They could then structure
interview questions to better understand that person's abilities in those
areas to make a more informed decision about a candidate.

 

In other JTAs that were developed under this project, SMEs also identified
physical attributes necessary to perform the job (e.g., lift X lbs over
head, see X feet). While these may also seem silly, they become very
important when developing high risk assessments, such as licensure exams, in
these spaces.

 

The real meat of each document is the DACUM chart located at the back of
each. These charts identify the specific domain areas, tasks, and steps that
the SMEs identified were necessary to perform the specified job. It is this
content specifically that is of most use to training/certification
providers, which is why DOE asked for comments on this specific chart in the
Federal Register notice.

 

The proposed content blueprint tables (located near the front of each
document), contain the SME's proposed weights for how often, and how
important, each of the identified tasks is to the job. Such weights provide
valuable context to training/certification providers by serving as
guidelines for how much time should be devoted to each topic.

 

As part of this project, NREL will be facilitating a "survey validation"
which will provide industry with the opportunity to adjust these weighting
factors. However, to avoid the confusion that would occur with two "comment
periods" occurring at once, this will not happen until DOE's public comment
closes at the end of November.

 

Please feel free to contact me if you have any additional questions.

 

Thanks,

Danny

Modelers: Open for public comment until Nov. 28th

 

I would like to be grandfathered in please. Who is scrutinizing this
document (proposed regulation?) at ASHRAE headquarters? Have you had any
input from ASHRAE?

If you were to do a jta for President of the United States it might not be
so lengthy as the one for building energy modelers. (And, a lot of folks in
the current primary would be automatically excluded). Is it possible that we
have the cart before the horse? Perhaps we need a jta for building
architects and building design engineers of which energy modelers could be a
subset.  I am sure that if DOE proposed a regulatory test procedure for
architects and engineers there would be plenty of comment. 

I've looked at the document. What caught my attentions was the list of
"skills and abilities." These included such thing as "time management
skills," "critical thinking," and  "spatial skills."  Assuming that the goal
is to define measurable skills, we might want to give energy modeler
want-a-be s the SAT again. 

Then I saw "common sense" and "patience" as skills and abilities. Now, not
withstanding the jta, I consider myself a competent modeler of buildings and
their energy systems. We don't need to vote on that but I also am reasonably
sure that "patience" has only recently kicked in as a personal skill (maybe
I am being optimistic). How are we going to measure the "common sense" of
someone who wants to apply to be an energy modeler?

Dr. Roth, it is not clear that very many in the building sciences field are
aware of your project, its history, and potential impact. Perhaps you could
get on the agenda at an upcoming ASHRAE meeting and explain the process and
your intent for the project outcomes.

Respectfully,

Chris,

If your parking is controlled by a CO sensor, Natural Resources Canada recommends for modeling a fan runtime of 6hrs (2hrs morning, 2hrs mid day and 2hrs evening). The details are in the EE4 modeling guide.

Chris,

Check your local jurisdiction's mechanical code. For example, the 2010
Mechanical Code of New York State, Section 404, covers enclosed parking
garages. Systems, "shall be permitted to operate intermittently where
the system is arranged to operate automatically upon detection of
vehicle operation or the presence of occupants by approved automatic
detection devices." Otherwise, public garage exhaust has to operate
continuously per 502.13.

 

Regards,

Bill

However a program like eQUEST can be used by someone with little knowledge of theory.  It is like driving a car without knowing the theory of internal combustion engine.  The analogy should be the car designer and not the driver.  Education (not 3 day seminars but 2 year graduate programs) and certification are important but so also is design experience to perform the energy analysis within a full understanding of the building life-cycle process. 
 
Why is there so much emphasis on building energy modeling and simulation?  The importance of this work is exaggerated.
 
The results of energy programs are not used in design and therefore not used in construction and operation.

They are also used to show energy code compliance and for sustainable buildings certification.  
 
A-E design affects the building products & equipment selected, construction and operation.  Design decisions are also based on * first & maintenance costs; * reliability & durability of systems, plant and equipment;  * ease of operation and maintenance; * availability of parts & maintenance staff at the location; * environmental impacts.

At an average A-E labor cost of $100/hour (including overheads) the design time is 75,000 hours.

My experience is different than yours Varkie.  We often need to simulate buildings to a high level of accuracy (too high in my opinion) in order to obtain state and federal rebates and incentives.  An entry level designer will most likely not be able to hit those targets and I would even say most staff level engineers would have a difficult time.   It takes some senior level engineering to understand how the building systems operate; what is a normal result; and most importantly, how the program is going to react when the inputs are changed.

I guess if the output reports are not reviewed with any scrutiny and the targets have a wide range of acceptance, you could hand it off to an entry level engineer.  But hitting an electric and natural gas utility bill, month-to-month and a yearly overall, simultaneously within +/- 10% accuracy will take a senior level understanding.  Also, it?s not the time that is important as much as the ability to do it.  The cost to my company for my time to perform the simulation is irrelevant compared to the rebates and incentives that will be unavailable, and as a consequence the construction project that won?t move forward,  if the simulation can?t be performed.

I may be stepping out of line here but aren?t we in this energy mess because buildings weren?t design for energy efficiency at all due to extremely low fuel costs back in the day?? Isn?t one of the main points of modeling to justify ROI investments as opposed to the cheapest first cost systems by owners? 

 

We finally have some documentation process to justify to owners/clients that hey, you can?t just keep putting the cheapest systems, it?ll cost more long term!!! Are you OK with that? Or do you want to look at other options with this data analysis I?ve done??

 

?Michael: I am retired and I think like someone who lived in days when there was no LEED certification and no energy code compliance.

I've been following this discussion closely and want to add a few things:

1.  The value of energy modeling has so far not been realized due to the
emphasis of using modeling on the back-end for LEED points and incentives,
instead of on the front end for design decision making.  As long as we are
arguing about the 'importance' of energy modeling, we need to recognize
this fact.

2.  Any time a new job description, exam or set of prerequisites is put
forth, many energy modelers get defensive or nervous because they might be
a very capable modeler, but their particular educational background or set
of skills does not fit into the current box that is drawn.  For example,
engineers often are the ones completing energy models because on any given
project team they usually have the best understanding of how the HVAC
systems in the building work.  As a result, I often see "licensed PE"
associated with energy modelers.  MEP professionals and energy modelers
share many skills, including understanding of HVAC systems and controls
systems and a fundamental knowledge of thermodynamics.  However, there are
many skills MEP professionals need that energy modelers do not need.  MEP
professionals also need to know how to size ductwork, select appropriate
components, create a set of drawings, write specifications and complete a
punch list.

Likewise with architects, many skills overlap between their discipline and
energy modeling, but energy modelers don't need to know how to size
structural elements or create a rendering.

In addition, there are many skills that are not inherent in either of the
two above professions, that are required for energy modeling.  Most
important is an in-depth knowledge of the available computer programs,
including their abilities and limitations.  I have also found that a good
understanding of computer programming has been invaluable as a way to
respect and use the software for it's strengths.

I thought BEMP was the first step to make energy modeling a profession of its own? Hasn't ASHRAE already analyzed the required skill set, work experience, and education when developing the test?  I work with several large incentive programs in north east, and was planning to push for making BEMP mandatory for modelers working in the programs. DOE Job Task Analysis project will weaken my chances of succeeding, because I can see administrators delaying the decision in expectation that some alternative, better certification will come out. Modelers may defer taking BEMP for this same reasons.  If DOE document has to be released, I think it is very important that it acknowledges the related prior work, and clearly defines where this parallel effort fits in.

All,

I was reading all of these emails this morning and I will admit, I've only scanned the Job Tasks Analysis document. But I think we should all put this in the perspective that this is a first step in Energy Modeling becoming a profession on its own. If I understand this correctly, these classifications are used as standard job definitions for things like the Occupational Outlook Handbook http://www.bls.gov/oco/, and to gather statistics on energy modeling as a profession, like how many are there in the country, what is their typical education, salaries for different levels of experience.

I am an energy modeler, much more than an architect, or a mechanical engineer. I for one am excited that energy modeler is becoming a stand-alone profession, rather than just a offshoot of one of the allied professions.

There may be flaws in the definition, and the process, but this kind of marks a coming of age of our field, and I think that is kind of exciting.

Daniel,



I still don't agree with your process. Your logic is flawed and most likely so is the document.



You excluded those organizations that could/will benefit from your document for no valid reason, and you have excluded known educators in this field, experts in the field, and other national labs.



For the most part this was developed off-line, out of public review. Hence the results of any such process cannot be trusted and the document must be regarded as being second rate.

Please note that this email contains responses to postings by both Mr. Haberl and Mr. Hittle.

Mr. Haberl:

The purpose of each JTA is to capture the job as currently practiced. Such a baseline document is essential in order to fairly and objectively identify knowledge and training gaps that exist between where any industry is and where it "should" be.

As such, we went to extreme efforts ensure that psychometrically valid sets of SMEs were selected to define the documents. Besides having to prove that they were current practitioners in the field, applicants were screened by a psychometrician (not DOE or NREL) using criteria such as geographic location, years of experience, and industry credentials to ensure that the selected group was broad with respect to all of these criteria (this is outlined in slightly more detail in the JTAs themselves). Bias in any one of these areas (experienced folks over novices, people from the east coast vs. the southwest, etc.) would have favored a particular group and skewed the resulting document in favor of that particular group's thinking. Since we were attempting to adequately capture the job as practiced in the U.S. (not as practiced by experts in the U.S., or by academics in the U.S., or how it should be done according to organization X, etc.), we wanted the broadest U.S. representation possible. This is also why there were no international participants.

Clearly, the inclusion of any professional society or organization directly involved in the development of such a document would also skew, whether meaning to or not, the resulting document toward the viewpoint of said organization. Indeed, to prevent this from happening, no outside reference materials were allowed into the workshops. Thus, the material presented in the JTAs comes directly from the first-hand knowledge of the participants. The resulting JTAs were all created by practitioners detailing what it was they did in their jobs.

I believe that the Boulder meeting you mentioned was the BEM Innovation Summit, which was hosted by RMI in Boulder last spring. The following is from PDF page 36 (document page 32) of the post summit report (http://rmi.org/Content/Files/BEM_Report_FINAL.pdf):
"Additionally, the DOE is currently sponsoring a project to develop (1) job task analyses (JTAs), which identify and catalog all of the activities a worker performs in a given job; and (2) the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs), which define the minimum requirements necessary to adequately perform those tasks, for six building job categories, including "energy modeler". The project goal is to create "national guidelines" which will define a common body of knowledge that any training organization will be able to draw from when developing curriculum, helping to ensure consistent core competencies among training programs."

An action item identified in that same report (PDF page 38) reads: "Respond to Doe's RFP to develop "national guidelines" for energy modeling education."



Mr. Hittle,

Congratulations on your recent retirement; that is one of my near-term goals (to be accompanied by a private island though).

I believe that you may not have seen my previous email to Nick Caton, which I believe (again, opinion) may answer most of the questions you pose. If not, please feel free to let me know and I will do my best to answer them. Like I said in my last email, this thread is getting a little fragmented.

However, I can answer one of the questions you pose here. The Federal Register notice released by DOE (http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-10-14/pdf/2011-26645.pdf) details the means by which they will accept public comment. While email is one of those means, said email must be sent to a specific email address and accompanied by a signed copy (there are other, less burdensome ways to submit comments as well). So in response to your question, no, this correspondence will not be officially documented as comments received on the documents.

Thanks all for the lively discussion!

Danny

All,

Apologies for the confusion. I had been responding previously only to the Bldg-sim listserv, as opposed to both the Bldg-sim and IBSPA-USA listservs. Below is my response earlier this evening to Nick Caton's email inquiry (again, sent only to the Bldg-sim listserv). Also, since things seemed to be quickly fragmenting, I have attempted to paste below all emails on this topic, so that everyone can easily reference them. I will follow up to the two most recent emails in a separate posting so that others may follow the conversation more easily.

Thanks,

Nick,

Your concerns are entirely understandable, but perhaps a little overstated. The intention with this project was to produce documents that could be used by the corresponding sectors to improve existing, or if necessary, create new, training/certification materials, thus leading to a more qualified and effective workforce. If you take a look at the job categories we targeted, I think you will see that we focused on jobs that have a direct impact on commercial building energy use.

The development of specific training/certification materials however, is being left up to the training/certification providers in each industry. Our goal was to eliminate the heavy lift for such organizations by facilitating the identification (by industry, not by DOE or NREL) of what tasks were required in each job category, and what knowledge, skills, and abilities were required to perform each of those tasks. The idea is that organizations who have existing training/certification programs can self-compare their program to the developed JTA to determine if they are adequately meeting industry's needs. Or, for industries where few training/certification programs exist, organizations could use the developed JTAs to immediately start developing curricula (the DACUM method is often used to create curricula at the community college level). Through these mechanisms, the idea was to improve the quality and amount of training available to the end-user (in this case, the modeler), with the ultimate goal being a reduction in real energy use at the building level.

Additionally, the JTAs can be used as a standardized metric of sorts to evaluate existing training/certification programs. We are currently working on a tool that will allow an end-user in each of the six fields to examine what content different training/certification programs cover, using the JTAs as a baseline (so that folks are comparing apples to apples, instead of apples to oranges). That way, they can make a more informed decision about where to invest their time and money when pursuing professional development activities.

I do know that GSA is planning to utilize the JTAs to support efforts related to the Federal Buildings Personnel Training Act of 2010. What other items (new licensure/certification/PDH requirements for government/military contracted work, etc.) will come out of this work I cannot speak to, as those decisions are likely to be out of my control and should they arise, will likely be made within each corresponding organization, far from my purview.

I know this is another long response, and that I did not directly address several of your questions. However, I felt that clarifying the project purpose would actually eliminate the need for such answers. If you feel differently let me know and I'll try to go through and provide more specifics.

Thanks,
Danny

My apologies Daniel, I suddenly realized that I am so old as to be before your time. I was project manager on the BLAST energy analysis program and my colleague and thesis adviser, Curt Pedersen was head of the BLAST support office and one of the project managers of EnergyPlus. We both have been very active in ASHRAE Technical Committee 4.7, Energy Calculations and 4.1 Load  Calculation.  I recently retired from Colorado State University where I taught HVAC design including energy modeling (BLAST, EnergyPlus via DesignBuilder, TRACE, TRANSIS, etc.). I feel fortunate that a number of our former students are now your colleagues at NREL.

As you no doubt know, the words "certification" and "licensure exam" (see your clarifying email) are loaded phrases in the consulting engineering community. While most practitioners support professional engineering exams and licensing, requirements for additional, new certification are not likely to be widely embraced, at least not until they can be shown to have some economic or other value. Furthermore, it may not be enough for cognizant organizations to be aware of your JTA work. Groups like NCEES and ASHRAE have to be early proponents of any certification or licensing program that might result from your project. Otherwise Republicans and Tea Partiers will claim that you are proposing more intrusive, job-killing government regulations (be clear, I am NOT expressing this opinion).

Aside from the (probably) uncontroversial goals of guiding training and education, and helping with job descriptions, what are the project goals and expected outcomes. Are the results to be used to create an industry standard (like standard 90)? Are parts of the work to be incorporated into building codes? Do you hope to create a Professional Engineering Exam for Energy Modeling? Perhaps the answer is "all of the above." The JTA report is vague about this, perhaps intentionally.

Just exactly why are you and your team doing this work? Who are its proponents? What are the hoped-for impacts? Who will be affected in the long run? I am not trying to be critical by asking these questions but without the answers it is hard to review the report.

Lastly, many energy modelers have a personal mantra that is not listed in your report: "It helps to know what you are doing!" If I were hiring that would be the main qualification.

Regards,

Doug Hittle

PS Can we all assume that these email exchanges will be considered as qualifying comments on the report as requested by Dr. Roth?

O.K.



So much for me reading my email...in fact, I did indeed get this but did nothing.



However, even though there was an email about this, there was no discussion about this at the June IBPSA-USA meeting, nor was there a request for this to be put on the agenda at the June ASHRAE meeting for TC 4.7, Standard 140, or other committees of interest. In addition, Charles Eley has held several conference calls (some of which I've attended), which have discussed COMNet, yet this was not mentioned on any of the calls I attended.



In addition, such documents like this, if they are coordinated with ASHRAE, will usually be sent to RAC then to the TCs for comment, back to RAC and then back to DOE.



Finally, if this effort was truly important to DOE, why are there no other participants from the other National Labs? Why is NREL the only lab with expertise in this area? Or for that matter, why are there no individuals from outside the US? Or even Canada?  Seems fishy.



Somehow, I still don't get a warm, friendly feeling about this.

Opportunity Announcement

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is currently
sponsoring a project to develop (1) job task analyses (JTAs), which
identify and catalog all of the activities a worker performs in a
given job; and (2) the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs), which
define the minimum requirements necessary for a person to adequately
perform those tasks, for the following six commercial building job
categories:

- Energy modeler
- Operating engineer/building technician
- Building energy auditor
- Energy/sustainability manager
- Commissioning/retro-
commissioning practitioner
- Facility manager

The project goal is to create "national guidelines" which will define
a common body of knowledge that any training organization will be able
to draw from when developing curriculum, helping to bring the core
competencies imparted by training organizations to their trainees into
common alignment. This body of knowledge will also be used by the
General Services Administration and the Department of Energy to help
meet the requirements of the Federal Buildings Personnel Training Act
of 2010.

To facilitate development of the JTAs/KSAs, Professional Testing,
Inc. is seeking current industry practitioners who are interested in
helping to define, promote energy efficiency in, and support their
field of practice by participating in these JTA/KSA development
workshops. Interested individuals are invited to submit their
credentials at http://proftesting.rapidinsites.com<http://proftesting.rapidinsites.com/>. Please note that
each JTA/KSA workshop will take place in Denver, Colorado and is
anticipated to last 3 full days (not including travel). Reimbursement
for travel costs up to a fixed amount and a travel per diem will be
awarded to individuals selected for participation. Additional project
details, including how practitioners will be selected and where to
direct project-related questions, can be found using the above link.

NREL and Professional Testing, Inc. are excited to present this unique
opportunity for individuals to have their voices heard in this
important discussion. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
The NREL Commercial Workforce Development Team

Daniel.



I'm afraid I can't agree that you conducted "extensive outreach" to prepare this document. For example, there was no discussion of this, before it happened, on any of the list servers before it came out. In addition, there was no "call for experts" that I was aware of. Normally, for a document like this that is sponsored by DOE, one would expect a call of some sort through the usual list servers.



In addition, I noticed from your list, that there is nobody who directly represents IBPSA-USA, nor even ASHRAE TC 4.7, which is the responsible ASHRAE TC for energy modeling. Although there are several individuals on the list who attend IBPSA and ASHRAE meetings and are well-known. It seems like little was done to notify others in IBPSA-USA or ASHRAE.



You should know that IBPSA-USA has also worked for some time on such an effort, which now exists as a wiki, under Joe Deringer's guidance. It also held a workshop in Boulder, and developed the BEM exam with ASHRAE. Yet, I see no reference to this or any of the previous efforts, nor efforts made to contact those of us who worked on this.



Finally, there are also at least a dozen or more educators within IBPSA-USA who teach Energy Modeling at the University level, yet not one of these individuals is mentioned in your list of contributors, only one academic appears on your list.



Hence, I suggest that if DOE is serious about making this a consensus document, then it needs to do a better job contacting the relevant organizations to obtain input and not rely on an email response after the fact.



Clearly, this is not the case with this document.

Daniel,

Thank you so much for this clarification!  I have to sympathize with Mr. Hittle in that, despite the apparent efforts to "spread the word," I too feel somewhat unsure of what the real implications will be for myself and my colleagues in the energy modeling world.

My current impression is that the results of this study will ultimately manifest as some sort of new licensure/certification/PDH requirements for modeling services in future LEED and/or military/government contracted work (i.e. DoD/GSA contracts)...  does that sound right?

Maybe an illustration would be helpful... This is from the comment document:

"JTA is traditionally used by secondary and postsecondary educators, test developers, and business, industry, government, and military trainers to help identify core knowledge areas, critical work functions, and skills that are common across a representative sampling of current practitioners."

Can you provide an example of what JTA's have accomplished for those working in the above industries?

For better or for worse, my concern is this study is going to add additional layers of beauracracy to the job description... Great news (enforced business) for those in the licensing/training industries I suppose, but will there be a net benefit for the actual practitioners?  Are my concerns unrealistic or missing the point?

Thanks again for your time and efforts!

Mr. Hittle,

My name is Daniel Studer and I am an engineer at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. I also happen to be the project lead for DOE's commercial job/task analysis development work.

I can assure you that we have conducted extensive outreach to ensure that persons who operate in the spaces targeted by these JTAs are fully aware of the work being performed, including ASHRAE.

The energy modeler JTA itself was created over the course of three days by eleven practicing energy modelers who were guided through the process by a professional psychometrician. The names and associated organizations of each of these folks are listed at the back of the JTA, in case you are curious. DOE and NREL had zero input into the content of this document. And to ensure that the document is truly reflective of the industry, DOE has decided to make the documents available for public comment. That way, individuals such as yourself can provide DOE with constructive feedback to ensure that the document content is both appropriate and valid.

The intent of the project, as stated on the project website, is to:
Provide a basis for developing and comparing new and existing training programs in the commercial building sector. This will help individuals identify opportunities to enhance their professional skills, enable industry to identify an appropriately skilled workforce, and allow training providers to ensure that they are providing the highest quality product possible.

In short, we are trying to document the job as it currently exists so that training/certification providers can ensure that they are providing high quality products in line with industry's identified needs. Additionally, gathering this information using the objective approach that we have also has the side benefit of creating a sort of baseline document that can be used to help a training/certification end user better understand how their current skill set and existing training/certification options fit together.

I totally agree with you that items identified such as "time management skills" are not very measurable, and in fact seem both excessive and irrelevant, in the context of developing a training program or certification around this material. However, such information is very valuable in other contexts, which is why it is included in any JTA which utilizes the "developing a curriculum" (DACUM) method. The idea is that all aspects of the job should be documented so that the resultant analysis can be used for multiple purposes. For example, an individual wishing to develop a job posting may look at the JTA and include items such as "time management skills" or "spatial skills" in the job posting. They could then structure interview questions to better understand that person's abilities in those areas to make a more informed decision about a candidate.

In other JTAs that were developed under this project, SMEs also identified physical attributes necessary to perform the job (e.g., lift X lbs over head, see X feet). While these may also seem silly, they become very important when developing high risk assessments, such as licensure exams, in these spaces.

The real meat of each document is the DACUM chart located at the back of each. These charts identify the specific domain areas, tasks, and steps that the SMEs identified were necessary to perform the specified job. It is this content specifically that is of most use to training/certification providers, which is why DOE asked for comments on this specific chart in the Federal Register notice.

The proposed content blueprint tables (located near the front of each document), contain the SME's proposed weights for how often, and how important, each of the identified tasks is to the job. Such weights provide valuable context to training/certification providers by serving as guidelines for how much time should be devoted to each topic.

As part of this project, NREL will be facilitating a "survey validation" which will provide industry with the opportunity to adjust these weighting factors. However, to avoid the confusion that would occur with two "comment periods" occurring at once, this will not happen until DOE's public comment closes at the end of November.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any additional questions.

Thanks,
Danny

I would like to be grandfathered in please. Who is scrutinizing this document (proposed regulation?) at ASHRAE headquarters? Have you had any input from ASHRAE?

If you were to do a jta for President of the United States it might not be so lengthy as the one for building energy modelers. (And, a lot of folks in the current primary would be automatically excluded). Is it possible that we have the cart before the horse? Perhaps we need a jta for building architects and building design engineers of which energy modelers could be a subset.  I am sure that if DOE proposed a regulatory test procedure for architects and engineers there would be plenty of comment.

I've looked at the document. What caught my attentions was the list of "skills and abilities." These included such thing as "time management skills," "critical thinking," and  "spatial skills."  Assuming that the goal is to define measurable skills, we might want to give energy modeler want-a-be s the SAT again.

Then I saw "common sense" and "patience" as skills and abilities. Now, not withstanding the jta, I consider myself a competent modeler of buildings and their energy systems. We don't need to vote on that but I also am reasonably sure that "patience" has only recently kicked in as a personal skill (maybe I am being optimistic). How are we going to measure the "common sense" of someone who wants to apply to be an energy modeler?

Dr. Roth, it is not clear that very many in the building sciences field are aware of your project, its history, and potential impact. Perhaps you could get on the agenda at an upcoming ASHRAE meeting and explain the process and your intent for the project outcomes.

Respectfully,
Doug Hittle

http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/commercial_initiative/pdfs/energy_modeler_jta_comment.pdf



DOE is accepting comments on this draft until November 28, 2011 at this URL: http://www.nrel.gov/ap/buildings_workforce_feedback/. Very few comments have been received so far. I urge you to review and comment on this draft as the final document will provide the foundation for future education, training and certification programs and will likely have to be complied with going forward by existing programs, e.g., ASHRAE BEMP. In addition to constructive critique, positive comments, e.g., "perfect, don't change a thing", are also welcome.

All,

Just to clarify. The DOE TDM (technical development manager) in 
charge of this project is Sonal Kemkar, cc'ed, who heads DOE's 
commercial building energy workforce development activities. Dan 
Studer from NREL is working with her on this project.  I sent the 
email to IPBSA-USA on Sonal's request to elicit more feedback on this 
document, but I was otherwise not previously involved. Seeing that I 
am the TDM in charge of all of DOE's other building energy modeling 
activities, in retrospect that seems an epic fail on my part. 
Certainly, some of this confusion/distress/anger(?) could have been 
avoided had I been paying more attention and I want to apologize to 
everyone for that. Going forward, I promise to do my part to keep 
this process as inclusive, transparent, and productive as possible, 
just as Sonal and Dan have done to this point.

Finally, I want to echo Chris Baker's sentiment--even with its 
inevitable imperfections this process represents a step forward for 
building energy modeling.

Onwards,

-Amir

Apologies for the following wall of text? those recognizing me from the lists know this is a tendency of mine =)!

 

This discussion is beginning to serve as a great example for why a formal assessment/clarification of the job would be requested!  Following are some thoughts that may serve as further input for the study:

 

?Energy Modeling?  is a service that means many things to many people.  These lists include a large body of highly intelligent and competent practitioners.  Those who have earned my respect collectively have a very diverse background of education levels, design experience, day-to-day responsibilities, and often unique expertise/perspectives within the realm of energy modeling.  

 

Contrary to Varkie (who I hold in very high regard), I can assert my modeling efforts are most often engaged for the primary purpose of informing and improving design, across the trades.  Compliance/LEED modeling comes in at a close second within my experience pool.  The importance of this skillset is most recognizable by the satisfaction of the design team members and owners who are constantly learning new things and seeing their buildings designed in a more cohesive & energy-informed fashion, not by a LEED plaque.  I believe today?s design teams and owners (including the government) are incrementally learning and recognizing the potential value a competent energy modeler brings to the table during the building design process, and it is showing in the language used for contracting new work.  LEED as a whole deserves credit as a catalyst for bringing this to light.  As more and more quality modelers join our ranks and blow away owners and design teams with quality work,  I think we can expect the demand to rise, and the need to differentiate who out there is a quality modeler will become more prominent.  I see this JTA study (and the legislation initiating it) as a natural progression by the powers-that-be to approach this challenge in a very deliberate fashion.  Defining the job would be a necessary early step along this path.

 

The best modelers (and to be clear I merely aspire to join this category) each have differing ideas regarding what represents an ?appropriate? degree of effort (hours for a given model), what constitutes and ?acceptable? degree of modeled accuracy and what value this skillset/service really represents.  I think any study trying to nail down those particular issues by asking the modelers would come up short.  The answers vary per-project and are ultimately answered by those paying the bills.

 

My experience is almost certainly different than both Michael and Varkie in terms of what degree of accuracy/time-investment is required on my ?average? project.  Select past discussions on the lists have helped me to understand that I personally spend a relatively high number of hours on any given project, but also have some more stringent expectations for what my models represent.  This is partially the result of my personal abilities, experience and standards of quality, however a large driver is the clients & fellow consultants who I work with and the relative complexity of their associated projects.

 

This discussion is brushing up against a very delicate topic requiring nuanced language?  I want to make some positions of mine crystal-clear for those soliciting energy modeling services today, those seeking input for this JTA study, and those who may use (or mis-use) this study?s results:  

1.       One cannot measure or judge the quality of an energy modeler or his/her work by the amount of time they spend on a project or any given part of a project.  What is appropriate for one project and modeler will be different for the next.  I expect modelers with less experience than me to produce high quality work, but to require more time to do so.  On the flip side, more experienced modelers should be capable of producing an equal quality of work in less time.  

2.       Neither can you rely on the how close a predictive model matches reality (utility bills) to evaluate a modeler.  Calibration modeling for existing/renovation work is a particular and distinct skill set within energy modeling, for which this metric has limited application? but predictive modeling is far too often mischaracterized and mis-used at a means of knowing the unknowable.

3.       Modelers, when permitted (and compensated) to be actively engaged in the design process, are to be regarded as a full and distinct member of the design team.  Our industry and even our modelers often undervalue the potential for these services.  I hope the weight and responsibilities of this ?active? role is conveyed in the JTA.  My current sense is someone might on first reading this come away with the impression energy modelers are only ever periphery to the design process, and someone may not realize the potential impact a modeler can have as an integral part of the design process.  To be certain, both roles exist for today?s modelers, and I expect this trend to continue.

4.       I want to echo/reinforce Maria?s concerns.  I think it is logical that those referencing this study in the future would be well served to be made aware of the present BEMP certification, who is behind it, and what it entails relative to the definition of what an energy modeler is.  I recognize there?s an aversion to referencing or drawing from any industry groups? but ignoring them entirely makes the task of defining the trade all the more difficult, at best.

5.       I?ve said a lot regarding metrics you cannot effectively use to identify a quality modeler ? and I realize that is only so helpful.  Perhaps none of this is considered appropriate for defining the job??  Still, if I were interviewing to hire a modeler, prioritizing quality in the end result and pushing speed/budget concerns to the side, I think a good start would be to compare how willing/comfortable the modeler is to discuss and share their modeling decisions.  Put another way, how ?open book? are the calculations?

 

~Nick

 

PS:  I propose whoever is in charge of collecting input for the JTA simply submit a copy of the discussion threads as they branch about and resolve themselves here on the lists.  Any single post or contribution taken out of context of the ongoing discussion might be misunderstood otherwise.

I may be stepping out of line here but aren?t we in this energy mess because buildings weren?t design for energy efficiency at all due to extremely low fuel costs back in the day?? Isn?t one of the main points of modeling to justify ROI investments as opposed to the cheapest first cost systems by owners? 

 

We finally have some documentation process to justify to owners/clients that hey, you can?t just keep putting the cheapest systems, it?ll cost more long term!!! Are you OK with that? Or do you want to look at other options with this data analysis I?ve done??

Hey Will,

 

I posed similar questions to an individual who started his career in mechanical systems consulting well before I was born.  His perspective is that energy-conscious building design has come into vogue and receded in waves over time, and will probably continue to do so as the availability of our energy resources become varies in the future.  The difference in this wave, and the reason it?s such a big deal, is that now we have all these fancy computers and software than can answer questions and reveal trends that could not be broached in the past.

 

I personally think it?s a stretch to suggest energy efficiency was not considered at all in the past few decades.  That may be true of some, but when 90.1 and energy code AHJ?s came along demanding less than 1.1 LPD for office lighting and using economizers where they make sense for packaged equipment and insulting the hot water lines?  many of us simply shrugged our shoulders ? it was already standard practice.  

 

I don?t believe anyone on these lists is presently arguing against any of your other points ;).

Hi Morgan,
California's Non-Residential ACM also has a good approach.  Comnet 
probably does as well, but I'm not as familiar with that doc.

Ok. One last comment and then I have to get back to paying work.

Listed below are pretty much all of the skills and abilities listed in the
DACUM in the DoE report:

? Computer skills ? Critical thinking skills ? Logical thinking ? Time
management? Engineering skills ? Math skills?Analytical skills? Research
skills? Organizational skills ? Physics? Creative? Logical thinking?
Observation skills? Safety conscious? Project management skills? Analytical
skills? Patience ? Persistence? Ability to interpret drawings.

In most Universities, ours included, we strive to inculcate all of the
items in the list into every student who graduates in any scientific
discipline. Our best engineering students graduate with these skills. Ergo,
they have the skills they need to be energy modelers. How is repeatedly
listing these abilities going to help anyone?

In the "Specialized Knowledge" column there is some unevenness. Knowledge
of the "Building design and construction" is all encompassing while
knowledge of "Vertical transportation" is limited and it is not clear what
knowledge is required for energy analysis.

Have we now ALL agreed the the DoE document will not be used for
certification, standards, licensing, etc.? YES or NO!!!

Doug Hittle

Years back, there were very few full-time modelers (found mainly in some top firms). Energy modeling was mostly a side task for some mechanical engineers and architects.

Nowadays, (and we can argue whether it is for the good or the bad), the importance of energy modeling has risen significantly, mainly due to LEED. Even small businesses are hiring energy modelers. That is why, I believe that, although imperfect (but what isn't?), this initiative from DOE should be encouraged.

All,

Just to clarify. The DOE TDM (technical development manager) in charge of this project is Sonal Kemkar, cc'ed, who heads DOE's commercial building energy workforce development activities. Dan Studer from NREL is working with her on this project.  I sent the email to IPBSA-USA on Sonal's request to elicit more feedback on this document, but I was otherwise not previously involved. Seeing that I am the TDM in charge of all of DOE's other building energy modeling activities, in retrospect that seems an epic fail on my part. Certainly, some of this confusion/distress/anger(?) could have been avoided had I been paying more attention and I want to apologize to everyone for that. Going forward, I promise to do my part to keep this process as inclusive, transparent, and productive as possible, just as Sonal and Dan have done to this point.

Finally, I want to echo Chris Baker's sentiment--even with its inevitable imperfections this process represents a step forward for building energy modeling.

Onwards,

-Amir

Hi Doug,  

 

I think the ?Skills, Abilities and Attributes? section and columns in the DACUM may be better coined ?personality traits? in layman?s terms, from the preceding section.  I?m guessing they?re intended for something like an aptitude test for high school kids?  

 

I?m not sure anyone is asking whether this report/effort is to be scrapped entirely ? for context I vaguely recall reading about legislation being passed mandating this sort of study be performed?  Here?s a link I found in my previous emails (thanks Danny!): Federal Buildings Personnel Training Act of 2010 <http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-111s3250enr/pdf/BILLS-111s3250enr.pdf> .  

 

All:

 

That said, Doug?s concerns below resonate further with an uncertainty I think many of us share over how this report may be used, or more specifically mis-used.  The document leads off with discussing what a JTA is and what it?s for, in relatively vague/generic terms (not specific to energy modeling).  You can pretty well tell from our community?s responses that this section needs to be fleshed out with more specific examples of who is asking for this study and why, and to better define the intent/purpose/projected end uses of the study.  This added context will better present the collected data and encourage more constructive feedback.

 

Some additional constructive thoughts along the lines of improving what?s there, based on my current understanding:

?         I see a lot of potential mis-use/misunderstanding of the ?weighting? presented for various job tasks, from an educational/training perspective.  Does this represent the time-distribution of an experienced modeler?  A new modeler?  For what sort of project (LEED, retrofit consulting, schematic analyses)?  I can confidently say this weighting distribution can and does vary widely between projects depending on the circumstances and who is involved, and for any given modeler.  Some discussion of what these percentages specifically represent is in order lest they be misused by the wide variety of sorts in the target audience (educators developing curricula for college students vs. professionals, or government contract writers thinking of experienced modelers, etc).

?         There are a number of items tabulated under ?Skills, Abilities and Attributes? which are more appropriately situated under ?Specialized knowledge,? such as ?Ability to interpret weather file structure.?  Likewise, I don?t believe ?Geometry? or ?Safety? constitute ?specialized knowledge? as the report currently describes it.  

?         While I am able to understand what is being referenced for the various attributes/knowledge? someone outside or periphery to our industry would most definitely not.  More than a few of these terms are either too broad/vague or too technical/specific to assume most would fully understand what?s being referenced by the panelists.  Such entries warrant further definition.

?         Section 8 reads: ?The panelists concluded that a practitioner must master the knowledge in both tables to be competent as a commercial building energy modeler.?

o   Reading and applying this literally, it would appear the panelists have concluded anyone who has not mastered ?Computational Fluid Dynamics? (among other things) is an incompetent modeler.

o   Based on my understanding of some of the panelists? backgrounds, I would be very surprised to find this is a true consensus, or that this specific wording has the full endorsement of everyone involved.  

o   Words like ?competent? and ?mastered? are dangerous if used too liberally in this sort of study, considering the possible usage of this report as we currently understand it.  If you intend to use such terminology, carefully consider whether you are setting up a doomsday scenario for the industry, where the newest generation of modelers will be unable to practice/learn energy modeling because they are not ?masters? of such a broad range of knowledge.  

 

I suppose this helps bring up another concern.  Where those participating and conducting this study may be totally rational and intelligent in the industry and subject matter at hand, this study is in part intended for use by those outside of our industry (HR staffing, politicians) who may not use its contents in a rational fashion.  Context (again) that we probably take for granted would seem a necessity to prevent such mis-use.

 

Hope this helps everyone involved!

All,

While I agree with some of the concerns regarding the Skills, Abilities and
Attributes section of the document, I think that people are overlooking the
real substance of the document, namely, the Duties, Tasks, and Steps that
were outlined to define the energy modeling process.

I would like to hear some specific comments regarding that portion of the
JTA.

Message-ID: <CAB_-mWOA_kvi8dUHQaZWPEXx5c-ztL=KpA=HkGqvOLoqxDum_Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

when modelling an active layer, there is a bunch of issues coming up:

   1. piping distance must be equal to or higher than 7 cm --> is there a
   way to model 5 cm?
   2. the pipes must be embedded in twice the same layer, i.e. the one
   above the active layer equals the one below, except for the thickness --)
   how can I model a case where the layer above has a very small thickness
   (like 1 cm)? There is a limit that is higher than that ... which I assume
   has to do with numerical stability ...
   3. there is a limit on the thickness for layers ... which I can get.
   Only issue than is the modelling of a thin bitumen layer of 2 mm is
   impossible --> solution?

Any suggestions on how to solve those?

thanks already

I don't have anything from USGBC, but I have some history from ASHRAE.  There are a series of interpretation requests to ASHRAE 90.1 about how handle AC systems serving primarily process loads.  It is clear that ASHRAE considers AC systems serving primarily process loads exempt from requirements of ASHRAE 90.1.  Since they don't have to meet minimum efficiencies, they need to be modeled the same when demonstrating compliance with ASHRAE 90.1.  See interpretation 4 about a theoretical central plant that is used mainly for IT cooling.

"The central plant is exempt from the requirements of Standard 90.1 and should be identical in both the Proposed Building Design and Budget Building Design."

The interpretation is worded for Chapter 11, which is another means to show compliance to the standard.  However it is interesting to note they are no longer applying this interpretation to Appendix G of 90.1-2007.  This seems like a logical progression sense Appendix G is meant to show energy efficiency not compliance.

"This interpretation also applies to Section 11 of 90.1-2007 as well as Appendix G of 90.1-2004 but does not apply to Appendix G of 90.1-2007."

Perhaps that knowledge may be helpful.

I completely agree with you Fred.  This is the same logic that i followed.  Unfortunately my superiors do not agree with this logic, even though I have shown them the same exception that you mention.  Their logic states that process loads shall be the same in both models, and anything associated with process loads (such as cooling for a data room or exhaust/make up air for a kitchen) do not serve any purpose except for process and therefore is also process.

Does anyone have anything from USGBC clarifying this issue?  I have looked through the interpretations and nothing speaks to the HVAC equipment of process loads.

Thanks for the input so far,

Rob

HVAC energy consumption caused by process loads cannot be called process loads. Nor would you want it to be a process load, because then you can't take credit for savings or at least not as easily.

Correct, your electrical or IT room with 90kW baseline is a system 3, and your Proposed can be an efficient design. ASHRAE 90.1-2007 G3.1.1 exception b allows you to apply system 3 for zones with large process loads.

This can be a huge source of energy savings. Enjoy it now, because rumor has it that the next version of 90.1 will set an alternate baseline for IT rooms and the like, and system 3 will no longer be applicable because the energy savings can be ridiculously large.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED Kitchen/Laundry HVAC Systems

In the situation that a design is utilizing an efficient exhaust/make up air system, the LEED book says that an exceptional calculation may be used to help quantify savings.  This leads me to believe that the kitchen cooking equipment is process, but the HVAC equipment is not.  My office has been having a "discussion" about whether HVAC equipment that conditions air for process equipment is considered process as well.

Another example that is plaguing me:  an electrical rack room has 90 kW of stuff and requires 25 tons of cooling.  If i use an efficient design, can i take credit for it by comparing my design to a baseline of system 3 (PTAC w/ DX cooling and furnace heating)?  I believe that this HVAC system should be allowed to get credit, but others argue that because it serves process equipment, then it is "process" heating/cooling.

Any thoughts from LEED AP out there? (i'm still working on getting my LEED AP).

Thanks,

Dear Hayes,

First question ? Unconditioned & Un-occupied or Conditioned & Occupied  

 

This is very important as conditioning mixes the air. 

 

In unconditioned & un-occupied we have measured stratification. This has
resulted in the measurement of temperature at different heights which is
then averaged to obtain a room air temperature.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] modelling stratification in houses

 

Hi,

 

I'm modelling single family dwellings in EnergyPlus, and I am wondering
about the accuracy of the typical assumption that the zones are fully mixed
.

 

The results of my modelling are showing that the high ratio of ceiling
insulation to wall insulation required by the codes (BC and Canada) seems to
higher than practical (i.e. no point having an R50 roof if your walls are
only R16). However, this is making me wonder if I should be trying to
account for the stratification that occurs in reality (which would increase
losses through the roof).

 

Anyone have any experience with modelling stratification in a scenario like
this? Or know of some empirical studies where the stratification has been
measured? I'm pretty sure I can set up a temperature gradient in the zone if
I know what it should be...

 

Thanks!

 

Hayes

Subject: [Bldg-sim] eQuest - Heating/Cooling Loads






Hi all,

I?m not sure I understand how eQuest calculates the heating/cooling
equipment loads.

I?ve built two models with identical envelopes and internal loads etc, and
OA supply.  In model A, we have a boiler and chiller on hot and chilled
water loops and a four-pipe fan coil air-side system.  In model B, we?re
using an air cooled Heat Pump and two-pipe fan coils.

In report PS-C for model A, the sum heat load is -29.6 MBTU, whereas for
model B, the sum heat load is -130.2 MBTU.  I understand that the fuel use
should be very different, but I don?t know why the load is so different
between the models.  Shouldn?t the heating energy delivered to the spaces be
the same in both cases?  Why does the Heat Pump system have a load that is
so much higher than its counterpart?

 

Similarly, in report SS-E, January has 110 Heating load hours for Model A,
and 385 Heating load hours for Model B.  Again, shouldn?t the loads be the
same between the two models?  

 

Thanks in advance for the help,

 

Katherine

Thanks Brian,

But I?d already examined LS-C, LS-D, SS-C and SS-D.  As one would expect,
LS-C and LS-D are the same for both models.  SS-D, however, is not.  I guess
what I don?t understand is what eQuest considers a ?load? to be.  I consider
?load? to be the requirements of the space (including envelope, occupants,
and OA), and none of those things have changed between my models.  The only
thing that changes is what system is used to meet the load.  

SS-D only has a monthly breakdown ? but doesn?t explain why the loads are
different.

 

Thanks,

Katherine

Look at the SS-D and LS-C reports.  SS-D shows the peak heating & cooling
loads with outdoor air, LS-C shows the same without outdoor air ... but will
show components so you can determine where the difference is.

I think this requirement comes from the mandatory provisions of 90.1.

 

6.4.3.4.3 Shutoff Damper Controls. Both outdoor

air supply and exhaust systems shall be equipped with motorized

dampers that will automatically shut when the systems or

spaces served are not in use. Ventilation outdoor air dampers

shall be capable of automatically shutting off during preoccupancy

Dear Patrick,

 

Thank you for sharing this GBCI response!  It is very informative and, while
I won?t admit that I?ve been modeling anything incorrectly, I am going to
change a couple of things :-).

In particular, I have heard on several occasions that the Increased
Ventilation credit was a clear case of ?IEQ vs. energy?; you make a decision
to trade one against the other.  After reading the GBCI response below and
then double-checking with ASHRAE 90.1, I find that they are consistent with
each other and effectively allow no penalty for the increased energy caused
by increased ventilation.  Very curious, considering there is no science
which demonstrates a health benefit for outdoor airflows greater than that
required by ASHRAE 62.1!

The other item is that I failed to notice (and still can?t find) anything in
621.1 which says that unoccupied ventilation should be zero.  I guess that
is OK, but is also curious, since a portion of the ventilation calcs in 62.1
include consideration for off-gassing materials (which are always present.)

All in all, I?m smarter than I was as a result of your post, so it?s a good
day!  Thanks again.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] usgbc response to outdoor air question

 

back in september there was a thread about what the outdoor air rate in a
baseline simulation should be compared to a proposed simulation,
specifically when one is adding 30% more outdoor air to meet the ieqc2
requirement and earn 1 leed point.  there were differences of opinions about
the flow rates between baseline and proposed being either the same (as
required in 90.1 app g) or the baseline being the calculated per 62.1 and
the proposed being as designed.

so i submitted a support request to the usgbc and the reply i received is
below, but in short the response is that unless you're using dcv optionally
the outdoor air rates in the baseline and proposed energy simulations for
eac1 should be the same.  the response below gives the standard responses to
differing outdoor air rate scenarios.

Dear Patrick,

Thank you for contacting the Green Building Certification Institute. 

You ask very good questions related to the relationship between ASHRAE
Standards 62.1 and 90.1, and how these standards are applied across multiple
LEED Rating System prerequisites and credits.

The simple answer to your question is that, for systems without demand
controlled ventilation, the outdoor air included in EA Credit 1 energy
simulations must be the same in the Baseline and Proposed cases. If the
project is attempting IEQ Credit 2 Increased Ventilation, then the values
calculated in IEQc2 must be used in the EAc1 Basline and Proposed case
energy models. Note that IEQc2 does not limit the project to providing only
30% more outdoor air than AHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate Procedure minimums, so
higher amounts are acceptable, as long as they are modeled identically in
both the Baseline and Proposed case energy models.

The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems
that do not have demand controlled ventilation:

It is unclear whether the minimum outside air rates (in CFM) were modeled
identically in the Baseline and Proposed case for all zones not having
Demand Control Ventilation in the Proposed case. Please confirm that minimum
outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled identically in the Baseline
and Proposed cases using the proposed case rates. Additionally, please
verify that all systems in both the baseline and proposed case are modeled
with zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied
setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an
alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the
unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline
and Proposed case).

The situation becomes a bit more complicated in you have systems that have
demand controlled ventilation (often implemented as Carbon Dioxide control
of outdoor air or as programmed control of outdoor air based on occupancy
sensors.) In this case the Baseline case energy model must include the
minimum outdoor air as determined by the ASHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate
Procedure calculations for all systems having demand controlled ventilation.


The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems
that do have demand controlled ventilation:

Demand control ventilation was modeled for credit in the proposed case.
Appendix G allows schedule changes for demand control ventilation as
approved by the rating authority (Table G3.1#4(Baseline)). As the LEED
Certification rating authority, GBCI requires that the outside air
ventilation rates for the Baseline case be modeled using minimum ASHRAE
62.1-2004 (or 2007 for LEED-NC 2009 projects) rates wherever credit is taken
for demand control ventilation in the Proposed case. The proposed case
minimum rates at design conditions should be modeled as designed. Please
verify that the Baseline Case model reflects ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or 2007)
minimum rates for any spaces where credit is taken for demand control
ventilation, or revise the model accordingly. For all other spaces, please
confirm that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled
identically in the Baseline and Proposed cases. Additionally, please verify
that all systems in both the baseline and proposed cases are modeled with
zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback
temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate
minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied
outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed
case).

Finally, even though you don't address energy recovery in your question,
whether or not you have energy recovery in your ventilation systems may
affect how much better (or worse) your Proposed case energy models perform
in relation to your Baseline case energy models. 

The following generic LEED Review Comment addresses energy recovery in EAc1
energy models as it relates to ventilation systems.

Energy recovery is modeled for credit in the Proposed case. Please provide
further information regarding the energy recovery efficiency, verify that
outside air is modeled with zero flow in both the Baseline and Proposed
cases during unoccupied periods when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied
setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an
alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the
unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline
and Proposed Case), and indicate the bypass mechanism used to bypass the
energy recovery during mild conditions. 

I hope that helps, but if you have any further questions or concerns, please

CUSTOMER INQUIRY:
I am trying to verify what the minimum outdoor airflow rate required for
EAc1 is and am not sure if this requires a CIR. 

If the Proposed outdoor air ventilation is a minimum of 30% higher than the
minimum required by ASHRAE 62 in order to achieve 1 LEED point for credit
IEQC2 is the Baseline outdoor air rate also 30% higher than the minimum
required by ASHRAE 62? or would the Baseline outdoor air ventilation rate be
the minimum outdoor air rate per ASHRAE 62 calculations. 

In other words, if ASHRAE 62 requires a minimum of 1,000 CFM of outdoor air,
and 1,300 CFM is provided to attain 1 LEED point via IEQC1, is the Baseline
outdoor air flow rate 1,000 CFM or 1,300 CFM in the energy simulation? 

90.1-2007/2004 both say the minimu    m outdoor airflow rates shall be the
same for both the proposed and baseline building designs, as does the user
manual. 

But this logic seems to reward the Proposed simulation by conditioning the
additional outdoor air supplied (300 cfm in the example above) to achieve
IEQC1 in the Baseline system as well as the proposed. 

The logic of using the minimum required in the Baseline case is reflected in
EAC1 in the equipment efficiency requirements. Baseline efficiencies are the
minimum required, e.g. SEER 13 for packaged units. 

It is the intent of the requirement that I am not sure is clear. Increasing
the outdoor air ventilation rate increases the energy used to condition the
outdoor air, so if the intent is to put the onus on Proposed design to show
energy reduction/LEED compliance over the 90.1/62 requirements shouldn't the
Baseline outdoor air be the minimum air flow rate per the ASHRAE 62
calculations? This puts the onus on the design team to provide a design that
compensates for the increase in energy to meet IEQC2 by providing some
method of processing the increase in outdoor air while still reducing energy
consumption.

Ouch!
In the Model energy code in Canada only up to 20% more than ASHRAE 62 is
allowed in the base case.  Imagine a building with 100% more OA and a ERV of
70% on the proposed case it can easily reach 10 EAcr1 point especially in
cold climate.

62.1-2004 (or 2007 for LEED-NC 2009 projects) rates wherever credit is taken
for demand control ventilation in the Proposed case. The proposed case
minimum rates at design conditions should be modeled as designed. Please
verify that the Baseline Case model reflects ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or 2007)
minimum rates for any spaces where credit is taken for demand control
ventilation, or revise the model accordingly. For all other spaces, please
confirm that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled
identically in the Baseline and Proposed cases. Additionally, please verify
that all systems in both the baseline and proposed cases are modeled with
zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback
temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate
minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied
outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed
case).

Finally, even though you don't address energy recovery in your question,
whether or not you have energy recovery in your ventilation systems may
affect how much better (or worse) your Proposed case energy models perform
in relation to your Baseline case energy models. 

The following generic LEED Review Comment addresses energy recovery in EAc1
energy models as it relates to ventilation systems.

Energy recovery is modeled for credit in the Proposed case. Please provide
further information regarding the energy recovery efficiency, verify that
outside air is modeled with zero flow in both the Baseline and Proposed
cases during unoccupied periods when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied
setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an
alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the
unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline
and Proposed Case), and indicate the bypass mechanism used to bypass the
energy recovery during mild conditions.

CUSTOMER INQUIRY:
I am trying to verify what the minimum outdoor airflow rate required for
EAc1 is and am not sure if this requires a CIR. 

If the Proposed outdoor air ventilation is a minimum of 30% higher than the
minimum required by ASHRAE 62 in order to achieve 1 LEED point for credit
IEQC2 is the Baseline outdoor air rate also 30% higher than the minimum
required by ASHRAE 62? or would the Baseline outdoor air ventilation rate be
the minimum outdoor air rate per ASHRAE 62 calculations. 

In other words, if ASHRAE 62 requires a minimum of 1,000 CFM of outdoor air,
and 1,300 CFM is provided to attain 1 LEED point via IEQC1, is the Baseline
outdoor air flow rate 1,000 CFM or 1,300 CFM in the energy simulation? 

90.1-2007/2004 both say the minimu    m outdoor airflow rates shall be the
same for both the proposed and baseline building designs, as does the user
manual. 

But this logic seems to reward the Proposed simulation by conditioning the
additional outdoor air supplied (300 cfm in the example above) to achieve
IEQC1 in the Baseline system as well as the proposed. 

The logic of using the minimum required in the Baseline case is reflected in
EAC1 in the equipment efficiency requirements. Baseline efficiencies are the
minimum required, e.g. SEER 13 for packaged units. 

It is the intent of the requirement that I am not sure is clear. Increasing
the outdoor air ventilation rate increases the energy used to condition the
outdoor air, so if the intent is to put the onus on Proposed design to show
energy reduction/LEED compliance over the 90.1/62 requirements shouldn't the
Baseline outdoor air be the minimum air flow rate per the ASHRAE 62
calculations? This puts the onus on the design team to provide a design that
compensates for the increase in energy to meet IEQC2 by providing some
method of processing the increase in outdoor air while still reducing energy
consumption.

While ASHRAE 90.1 does a pretty good job of defining higher efficiency
practices, it?s not perfect.  On the other hand, that?s why Appendix G is
there; you can show why your idea is better, at least on the energy part of
things.

There are still issues with the general level of knowledge among both the
reviewer community as well as the energy modeling community, and that may
never cease.  As is commonly the case, a designer often is facing either
(energy efficiency) / or (greater IAQ & productivity).  The challenge is how
to get the best combination of both.

One benefit of LEED certification seems to have been that many engineer
designers have responded to the challenge of greater efficiency and
performance and changed their standard designs in favor of something with
better performance.  That?s probably very good, largely because stagnation
is never good.

There certainly is experimentation going on, not all of which is producing
great results, but I still prefer a real attitude of ?continuous
improvement? over stagnation!

Dear Patrick,
 
Thank you for sharing this GBCI response!  It is very informative and, while
I won?t admit that I?ve been modeling anything incorrectly, I am going to
change a couple of things J.
In particular, I have heard on several occasions that the Increased
Ventilation credit was a clear case of ?IEQ vs. energy?; you make a decision
to trade one against the other.  After reading the GBCI response below and
then double-checking with ASHRAE 90.1, I find that they are consistent with
each other and effectively allow no penalty for the increased energy caused
by increased ventilation.  Very curious, considering there is no science
which demonstrates a health benefit for outdoor airflows greater than that
required by ASHRAE 62.1!
The other item is that I failed to notice (and still can?t find) anything in
621.1 which says that unoccupied ventilation should be zero.  I guess that
is OK, but is also curious, since a portion of the ventilation calcs in 62.1
include consideration for off-gassing materials (which are always present.)
All in all, I?m smarter than I was as a result of your post, so it?s a good
day!  Thanks again.

Dear Patrick,

Thank you for contacting the Green Building Certification Institute. 

You ask very good questions related to the relationship between ASHRAE
Standards 62.1 and 90.1, and how these standards are applied across multiple
LEED Rating System prerequisites and credits.

The simple answer to your question is that, for systems without demand
controlled ventilation, the outdoor air included in EA Credit 1 energy
simulations must be the same in the Baseline and Proposed cases. If the
project is attempting IEQ Credit 2 Increased Ventilation, then the values
calculated in IEQc2 must be used in the EAc1 Basline and Proposed case
energy models. Note that IEQc2 does not limit the project to providing only
30% more outdoor air than AHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate Procedure minimums, so
higher amounts are acceptable, as long as they are modeled identically in
both the Baseline and Proposed case energy models.

The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems
that do not have demand controlled ventilation:

It is unclear whether the minimum outside air rates (in CFM) were modeled
identically in the Baseline and Proposed case for all zones not having
Demand Control Ventilation in the Proposed case. Please confirm that minimum
outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled identically in the Baseline
and Proposed cases using the proposed case rates. Additionally, please
verify that all systems in both the baseline and proposed case are modeled
with zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied
setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an
alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the
unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline
and Proposed case).

The situation becomes a bit more complicated in you have systems that have
demand controlled ventilation (often implemented as Carbon Dioxide control
of outdoor air or as programmed control of outdoor air based on occupancy
sensors.) In this case the Baseline case energy model must include the
minimum outdoor air as determined by the ASHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate
Procedure calculations for all systems having demand controlled ventilation.


The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems
that do have demand controlled ventilation:

Demand control ventilation was modeled for credit in the proposed case.
Appendix G allows schedule changes for demand control ventilation as
approved by the rating authority (Table G3.1#4(Baseline)). As the LEED
Certification rating authority, GBCI requires that the outside air
ventilation rates for the Baseline case be modeled using minimum ASHRAE
62.1-2004 (or 2007 for LEED-NC 2009 projects) rates wherever credit is taken
for demand control ventilation in the Proposed case. The proposed case
minimum rates at design conditions should be modeled as designed. Please
verify that the Baseline Case model reflects ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or 2007)
minimum rates for any spaces where credit is taken for demand control
ventilation, or revise the model accordingly. For all other spaces, please
confirm that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled
identically in the Baseline and Proposed cases. Additionally, please verify
that all systems in both the baseline and proposed cases are modeled with
zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback
temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate
minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied
outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed
case).

Finally, even though you don't address energy recovery in your question,
whether or not you have energy recovery in your ventilation systems may
affect how much better (or worse) your Proposed case energy models perform
in relation to your Baseline case energy models. 

The following generic LEED Review Comment addresses energy recovery in EAc1
energy models as it relates to ventilation systems.

Energy recovery is modeled for credit in the Proposed case. Please provide
further information regarding the energy recovery efficiency, verify that
outside air is modeled with zero flow in both the Baseline and Proposed
cases during unoccupied periods when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied
setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an
alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the
unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline
and Proposed Case), and indicate the bypass mechanism used to bypass the
energy recovery during mild conditions.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] usgbc response to outdoor air question






There was an earlier discussion on the list about this:

 

62.1-2007, Section 5.4 states ?Mechanical ventilation systems shall include
controls, manual or automatic, that enable the fan system to operate
whenever the spaces served are occupied.  The system shall be designed to
maintain the minimum outdoor airflow as required by Section 6 under any load
condition.?

 

62.1-2007, Section 6.2.6.1 states ?Ventilation systems shall be designed to
be capable of providing the required ventilation rates in the breathing zone
whenever the zones served by the system are occupied, including all full-
and part-load conditions.?

 

These are generally applied to mean that the system is not required to
operate when spaces are unoccupied.  Yes, the standard does not explicitly
state that unoccupied ventilation should be zero but the standard does not
explicitly state that unoccupied ventilation can?t be zero.  Section 5.4 and
6.2.6.1 only require controls and ventilation rates ?whenever the
spaces/zones served by the system are occupied? so it can be implied that
the requirement doesn?t apply when the spaces/zones are unoccupied.  There?s
a fine interpretive line there, but many of the official interpretations on
62.1 also lean this direction.  If in doubt, put in an official
interpretation request specifically on this with ASHRAE on the topic to
clarify.

Dear Patrick,

Thank you for contacting the Green Building Certification Institute. 

You ask very good questions related to the relationship between ASHRAE
Standards 62.1 and 90.1, and how these standards are applied across multiple
LEED Rating System prerequisites and credits.

The simple answer to your question is that, for systems without demand
controlled ventilation, the outdoor air included in EA Credit 1 energy
simulations must be the same in the Baseline and Proposed cases. If the
project is attempting IEQ Credit 2 Increased Ventilation, then the values
calculated in IEQc2 must be used in the EAc1 Basline and Proposed case
energy models. Note that IEQc2 does not limit the project to providing only
30% more outdoor air than AHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate Procedure minimums, so
higher amounts are acceptable, as long as they are modeled identically in
both the Baseline and Proposed case energy models.

The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems
that do not have demand controlled ventilation:

It is unclear whether the minimum outside air rates (in CFM) were modeled
identically in the Baseline and Proposed case for all zones not having
Demand Control Ventilation in the Proposed case. Please confirm that minimum
outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled identically in the Baseline
and Proposed cases using the proposed case rates. Additionally, please
verify that all systems in both the baseline and proposed case are modeled
with zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied
setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an
alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the
unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline
and Proposed case).

The situation becomes a bit more complicated in you have systems that have
demand controlled ventilation (often implemented as Carbon Dioxide control
of outdoor air or as programmed control of outdoor air based on occupancy
sensors.) In this case the Baseline case energy model must include the
minimum outdoor air as determined by the ASHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate
Procedure calculations for all systems having demand controlled ventilation.


The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems
that do have demand controlled ventilation:

Demand control ventilation was modeled for credit in the proposed case.
Appendix G allows schedule changes for demand control ventilation as
approved by the rating authority (Table G3.1#4(Baseline)). As the LEED
Certification rating authority, GBCI requires that the outside air
ventilation rates for the Baseline case be modeled using minimum ASHRAE
62.1-2004 (or 2007 for LEED-NC 2009 projects) rates wherever credit is taken
for demand control ventilation in the Proposed case. The proposed case
minimum rates at design conditions should be modeled as designed. Please
verify that the Baseline Case model reflects ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or 2007)
minimum rates for any spaces where credit is taken for demand control
ventilation, or revise the model accordingly. For all other spaces, please
confirm that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled
identically in the Baseline and Proposed cases. Additionally, please verify
that all systems in both the baseline and proposed cases are modeled with
zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback
temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate
minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied
outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed
case).

Finally, even though you don't address energy recovery in your question,
whether or not you have energy recovery in your ventilation systems may
affect how much better (or worse) your Proposed case energy models perform
in relation to your Baseline case energy models. 

The following generic LEED Review Comment addresses energy recovery in EAc1
energy models as it relates to ventilation systems.

Energy recovery is modeled for credit in the Proposed case. Please provide
further information regarding the energy recovery efficiency, verify that
outside air is modeled with zero flow in both the Baseline and Proposed
cases during unoccupied periods when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied
setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an
alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the
unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline
and Proposed Case), and indicate the bypass mechanism used to bypass the
energy recovery during mild conditions. 

I hope that helps, but if you have any further questions or concerns, please
feel free to use the contact form at http://www.gbci.org/contactus and
select "Follow up to GBCI Response," inputting your case number from this
email's subject line.

The text above represents a staff opinion of a particular issue, and does
NOT set any precedent to be upheld during a LEED Certification Review. For
official rulings in advance of a LEED Certification Review, customers should
utilize the Formal Inquiries process available in LEED Online that results
in a Project Credit Interpretation Ruling (Project CIR) and possibly a LEED
Interpretation (formerly CIRs or Public Rulings). Applications for LEED
Certification will be thoroughly reviewed based on USGBC Member balloted and
approved LEED Rating Systems, with addenda, and USGBC approved LEED
Interpretations, or Project CIRs administered by GBCI, as applicable. Please
note that certain inquiries submitted to USGBC are forwarded to GBCI for
reply as appropriate.

CUSTOMER INQUIRY:
I am trying to verify what the minimum outdoor airflow rate required for
EAc1 is and am not sure if this requires a CIR. 

If the Proposed outdoor air ventilation is a minimum of 30% higher than the
minimum required by ASHRAE 62 in order to achieve 1 LEED point for credit
IEQC2 is the Baseline outdoor air rate also 30% higher than the minimum
required by ASHRAE 62? or would the Baseline outdoor air ventilation rate be
the minimum outdoor air rate per ASHRAE 62 calculations. 

In other words, if ASHRAE 62 requires a minimum of 1,000 CFM of outdoor air,
and 1,300 CFM is provided to attain 1 LEED point via IEQC1, is the Baseline
outdoor air flow rate 1,000 CFM or 1,300 CFM in the energy simulation? 

90.1-2007/2004 both say the minimu    m outdoor airflow rates shall be the
same for both the proposed and baseline building designs, as does the user
manual. 

But this logic seems to reward the Proposed simulation by conditioning the
additional outdoor air supplied (300 cfm in the example above) to achieve
IEQC1 in the Baseline system as well as the proposed. 

The logic of using the minimum required in the Baseline case is reflected in
EAC1 in the equipment efficiency requirements. Baseline efficiencies are the
minimum required, e.g. SEER 13 for packaged units. 

It is the intent of the requirement that I am not sure is clear. Increasing
the outdoor air ventilation rate increases the energy used to condition the
outdoor air, so if the intent is to put the onus on Proposed design to show
energy reduction/LEED compliance over the 90.1/62 requirements shouldn't the
Baseline outdoor air be the minimum air flow rate per the ASHRAE 62
calculations? This puts the onus on the design team to provide a design that
compensates for the increase in energy to meet IEQC2 by providing some
method of processing the increase in outdoor air while still reducing energy
consumption.

Dear All,



As an emerging modeler I was excited by this discussion.

I found it quite exceptional, recognizing among participants highly
respected professionals whom I learned recently from this discussion group.



As a member of modeling community I consider this email list as a great
source of real-life professional information.



Having said that I'm wondering why the value created by respected
professionals can be wasted for the sake of an instruction. Why
the government cannot use the comments that has been already expressed and
recorded, despite the fact that it wants to know these comments.


Moreover, email-service allows to save all posts in a single pdf
preserving the chronological
order of Qs and As, which otherwise would be very time consuming to
reproduce.


Being thrilled by this discussion i decided to do a simple thing as to
attach a pdf, comprising last 27 posts of this discussion.

(Surprisingly, the pdf-file made by Mac is 10 times smaller than    the one
made by Windows)


Please forgive me if I did violate some US public/government relation
orders, since I'm from another country.


Best Regards to everyone,


Pavel Dybskiy

Hayes,

In EnergyPlus it's fairly straightforward to model room air stratification

Simply include one RoomAirModelType object per zone. This will give you the
ability to specify the zone stratification pattern desired. You can specify
a three node displacement ventilation pattern, an underfloor air
distribution temperature pattern, or a user defined gradient.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Energy Modeling of Composite Structural Insulated Panel
	Systems?
Message-ID: <005501cca98c$1a8cc350$4fa649f0$@com>

Hi everyone:  My name is Brian Strombotne.  I recently joined IBPSA  USA
with the intent of helping an innovative building systems manufacturing
client find an Energy Modeling firm that will simulate the performance of
his Composite Structural Insulated Panel building system.  My client is a
Texas based manufacturer of a very unique, composite skinned - fiberglass
reinforced thermoset - structural panel and sheathing systems with a
polyurethane foam core - R-26 in 4-1/2" thick panel.  The composite skin
acts as the structural member as well as the air barrier, vapor retarder and
drainage plane - no house wrap is needed.   The panels and sheathing have
undergone extensive testing with Radco in California in order to achieve an
ICC-ES report.  Currently, there are not any prototype houses or buildings
to conduct actual energy performance tests - blower door tests for example -
only the ASTM and ICC-ES testing at this stage.

 

The Composite SIPS - C-SIPS are attached to each other using an Fiberglass
Reinforced Thermoset "H-Stud" - screwed through the panel's skin  - then the
joint is sealed with a marine adhesive and a 3M Flashing Tape.  Connections
are made at the top and bottom plates with an FRT plate rather than a 2 x 4.
The FRT joint connection materials are manufactured by Bedford
Thermoplastics and have tested, measured performance with ASTM reports, etc.
All adhesive and sealants or flashing tapes are manufactured by 3M or
Venture Tape and also have the appropriate and required ASTM reports or
ICC-ES reports.

 

My fundamental question is this:  is there a method or approach to simulate
the energy performance of a complete home including these "wall assemblies"
with composite skins, joint and top and bottom plate FRT materials?  Or for
a typical home as compared with 2x4 walls or other conventional wall
assemblies?  My client has reached out to numerous energy modeling firms and
no one seems to have the ability or interest in modeling anything other than
an existing wood / steel / fiberglass or foam  wall assemblies where an
existing number is plugged into the simulation model and it calculates the
results (I know it's not that simple).  

 

If your firm has a methodology or process for modeling complex material
systems will you please email me and let me know your thoughts and
capabilities?  I'll share my client's web site and contact information so
you can begin a dialog on process, outcomes and costs.

 

Thanks for your help and consideration.

 

 

Best, Brian

I don't have anything from USGBC, but I have some history from ASHRAE.
There are a series of interpretation requests to ASHRAE 90.1 about how
handle AC systems serving primarily process loads.  It is clear that ASHRAE
considers AC systems serving primarily process loads exempt from
requirements of ASHRAE 90.1.  Since they don't have to meet minimum
efficiencies, they need to be modeled the same when demonstrating compliance
with ASHRAE 90.1.  See interpretation 4 about a theoretical central plant
that is used mainly for IT cooling.

 

"The central plant is exempt from the requirements of Standard 90.1 and
should be identical in both the Proposed Building Design and Budget Building
Design."

 

The interpretation is worded for Chapter 11, which is another means to show
compliance to the standard.  However it is interesting to note they are no
longer applying this interpretation to Appendix G of 90.1-2007.  This seems
like a logical progression sense Appendix G is meant to show energy
efficiency not compliance.

 

"This interpretation also applies to Section 11 of 90.1-2007 as well as
Appendix G of 90.1-2004 but does not apply to Appendix G of 90.1-2007."

 

Perhaps that knowledge may be helpful.

I completely agree with you Fred.  This is the same logic that i followed.
Unfortunately my superiors do not agree with this logic, even though I have
shown them the same exception that you mention.  Their logic states that
process loads shall be the same in both models, and anything associated with
process loads (such as cooling for a data room or exhaust/make up air for a
kitchen) do not serve any purpose except for process and therefore is also
process.  

 

Does anyone have anything from USGBC clarifying this issue?  I have looked
through the interpretations and nothing speaks to the HVAC equipment of
process loads.

 

Thanks for the input so far,

 

Rob

HVAC energy consumption caused by process loads cannot be called process

take credit for savings or at least not as easily. 

 

Correct, your electrical or IT room with 90kW baseline is a system 3, and
your Proposed can be an efficient design. ASHRAE 90.1-2007 G3.1.1 exception
b allows you to apply system 3 for zones with large process loads. 

 

This can be a huge source of energy savings. Enjoy it now, because rumor has
it that the next version of 90.1 will set an alternate baseline for IT rooms
and the like, and system 3 will no longer be applicable because the energy
savings can be ridiculously large.

In the situation that a design is utilizing an efficient exhaust/make up air
system, the LEED book says that an exceptional calculation may be used to
help quantify savings.  This leads me to believe that the kitchen cooking
equipment is process, but the HVAC equipment is not.  My office has been
having a "discussion" about whether HVAC equipment that conditions air for
process equipment is considered process as well.

 

Another example that is plaguing me:  an electrical rack room has 90 kW of
stuff and requires 25 tons of cooling.  If i use an efficient design, can i
take credit for it by comparing my design to a baseline of system 3 (PTAC w/
DX cooling and furnace heating)?  I believe that this HVAC system should be
allowed to get credit, but others argue that because it serves process
equipment, then it is "process" heating/cooling.

 

Any thoughts from LEED AP out there? (i'm still working on getting my LEED
AP).

 

Thanks,

 Design for Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings
Message-ID: <4ED172F3.7080209@gard.com>

Last May, as part of a long thread of discussions on the 
BLDG-SIM mailing list (under the subject "Energy Model 
Cost") I brought up the idea that ASHRAE should create a new 
standard related to building energy simulation. A lot has 
happened since then, after a few conference calls, some 
presentations to various ASHRAE committees, and many 
revisions of the title purpose and scope, it looks like the 
new ASHRAE Standard 209 is going to be written.  The 
approved title purpose and scope is:

TITLE: Energy Simulation Aided Design for Buildings Except 
Low-Rise Residential Buildings

PURPOSE: Define minimum requirements for providing energy 
design assistance using building energy simulation and analysis.

SCOPE: This standard applies to new buildings or major 
renovations of, or additions to, existing buildings 
utilizing energy simulation during the design process. This 
standard does not apply to single-family houses, 
multi-family structures of three stories or fewer above 
grade, manufactured houses (mobile homes) and modular homes.

At this point, the new committee is looking for members. 
Attached is the call for members. If you are interested in 
joining, please complete the form "Application for 
Individual Project Committee Membership" (and related forms) 
found on:

http://www.ashrae.org/technology/page/97

If you can think of anyone else that might be interested, 
feel free to forward this email to them.

My apologies for cross-posting to so many simulation 
oriented mailing list.

Thanks,

Jason

	and latitude in eQUEST (3.64)
Message-ID: <1046666EA0C49F45B03BB58B12C0D827172BB4@lems01.lemon.local>

Hi all,

We have a LEED project in the center of Berlin for which I need to perform a LEED Compliance analysis (LEED V3.0). We have chosen to use eQUEST 3.64 as it can generate automatically the reference building (baseline). I have read the eQUEST introductory tutorial as well as the LEED tutorial. 

I have built my building model (7 storey-building + 2 basement floors, compact shape and quite simple layout) using the SD wizard than the DD wizard and finally twicking my HVAC inputs in the detailed mode. I have managed to run a simulation after correcting my BDL errors, however I cannot run a LEED Compliance analysis (generate baseline building), since it fails in the pre-check stages.

 The reason is I have not entered a longitude and latitude for Berlin! I have desperately tried to enter one but the input cell won't let me (the cells are colored in white but when I type a figure there, the software doesn't hold the value down...same for the altitude of the site). I have managed to enter the time zone though (-1).

Latitude for Berlin is 52.47 N, and latitude is 13.4 E therefore the input should be +52.47 and -13.4?

I have generated a Berlin weather file using an Energy plus weather file and converting it. <<ScreenShot019.jpg>>  <<DEU_Berlin_IWEC.BIN>> 

I attach a screenshot of the error message as well as my weather file. Maybe I am making a basic mistake and someone could point me rapidly in the right direction?

I would appreciate any help!

Kind regards,
Anne

Jason et all:

 

I will start with some specific commentary, then step back to discuss
the overall scope of this JTA and my opinion of how the broader goals
should be refined.  I'll preface that this collection of feedback is
blending together discussions I've had recently and in the past with
other colleagues on and off the lists over the topic - these thoughts
may be considered reviewed and coming from more than one of us, in
short.  I hope this helps improve and refine the current efforts to a
positive effect for everyone involved.

 

The document needs to be reviewed for sensible and clear terminology
usage, and to remove any redundant items (stuff a spell-check is not
going to pick up).  For example, Table 7.A.6.a&b lists the two following
tasks side-by-side:

*         Review baselines required for Codes, standards, and protocols

*         Identify additional baselines

The distinction is not clear from the provided context.  On my first
reading I mentally corrected both to reference "baseline requirements,"
but that doesn't read particularly well if these are supposed to be two
distinct tasks either...  Baselines do not always come from a
standard/protocol, as I'm to discuss more thoroughly further down...
perhaps that's what's intended?

 

Specific to the gathered tasks and workflow presented, something I
touched on earlier was how the entire report seems structured around a
specific modeling role and scope of work.  Reviewing what is presented,
this scope initially appears to have a few identifiable characteristics:

*         The energy modeling consultant is working periphery to the
design process (not a member of the "design team")

*         An emphasis appears placed upon identifying and constructing a
baseline model per existing conditions, suggesting the scope of work is
for a renovation/retrofit project.

*         While the modeler is supposed to be familiar with LEED and
similar standards, the duties/tasks/steps for the project at hand are
not specific as to whether a formal performance rating method is being
followed or documented.  If that is the case, I would expect at least
different weightings between the relatively tasks presented.

 

It has since been clarified to me by one of the participating panelists
that the above perceived set of scope characteristics are likely the
combined result of:

*         Discouraging panelists from referencing any specific standard
or protocol (i.e. LEED), where such compliance documentation & review
responses can at times represent a significant portion of the time spent
on a modeling project. 

*         Panelists were asked to iterate every task involved in both
new construction and existing building projects, which introduces
communicative and information-gathering tasks that would not apply under
different scope/project circumstances.

 

These observations lead me to point out and explain something more
fundamental to energy modeling that the rigid structure of the JTA study
procedure/format seems naturally prone to miss.  As has been repeatedly
noted, "energy modeling" is a broad term that describes a wide breadth
and depth of services, knowledge and skillsets.  I would not object to
the duties currently presented being adequately inclusive for the
workflow of a very specific scope of work, but the box as drawn both
misses and diminishes other areas of modeling that I think are integral
to the job description and the industry... If the job of "energy
modeler" must be defined in a "workflow" fashion (duties/tasks/steps) as
currently presented, I would instead propose coming up with a workflow
to describe three separate and distinct categories of modeling services:

*         "Compliance Modeling" - Using energy models to demonstrate
code/standard compliance and using prescriptive procedures such as the
Performance Rating Method to demonstrate relative performance against an
established design standard (i.e. LEED, Title24, EPAcT)

*         "Renovation/Retrofit Modeling" - Modeling inclusive of
existing buildings and systems, characteristically involving additional
measurements and information gathering to define and calibrate baseline
models tied more closely to reality, with the explicit intent to make
informed cost-benefit and ROI analyses and recommendations for cost
saving measures.

*         "Design Analysis Modeling" - SD/DD early stage decision-making
modeling, wherein baselines and results are built on relatives and
isolating the variables in play to analyze and inform design decisions.
Baselines are dynamic to suit any given study, and inherently cannot
follow a prescriptive modeling standard assuming a complete design.
More description to follow.

 

The order and weighting of the JTA duties/tasks/steps descriptions, as
well as the areas of critical knowledge, varies for each of the above
categories.  For example, one doing "Renovation/Retrofit" modeling would
generally want to first invest a good deal of time building a baseline
model to match the properties and behavior of the existing building and
its contents.  An adequately calibrated baseline would functionally
serve as a tool useful to identify the relative impact of individual and
combined cost saving measures, and might also inform parallel ROI
analyses for the building owner's benefit.  On the other hand, if one is
being asked to provide modeling services specifically for LEED or
another prescriptive performance rating, then he or she would generally
be best served to start by accurately modeling the proposed design, from
which the baseline can be constructed.  In either instance, the steps
and questions to be answered for "information gathering" stages, as well
as the order and weighting of each "phase" varies quite dramatically.  

 

Note:  The three above categories of modeling are not mutually exclusive
- any single project could conceivably incorporate any combination of
the three, but they each draw on distinct skill sets.  Obtaining the
experience & knowledge to be an "expert" (or "qualified" or "competent"
... all potentially loaded terms I would advise using judiciously) in
any one sub-field of energy modeling does not make one a master of all
three areas, and simultaneously having little experience in any one area
does not render a modeler incompetent either.

 

Much can be said to further differentiate and define these 3 areas, but
where the first two are I think at least immediately
identifiable/distinguishable to those within and periphery to our
industry, I'll provide some extra attention to help define "Design
Analysis" modeling for this discussion - which I consider to be the
least well-defined within our present industry (discussions surrounding
the next iteration of LEED suggest this may change in years to come).
Design decisions for new construction are often made without a finished
proposed design to reference nor an existing building with energy bills
to calibrate to.  "Baselines" instead must be built in direct response
to the queries posed, based on what information is and is not available.
To illustrate with an example I've used previously: one may wish to pose
a question like  "What is the ideal WWR for the walls along our Southern
facing building facades, considering the savings of daylighting controls
and the impact of the resulting envelope thermal losses/gains?"  This
sort of question can be answered by a competent energy modeler, but to
answer this question in a time-efficient fashion one has to have
distinct skills of being able to identify, isolate and be ready to
communicate & discuss:

(1) the measures being explored, 

(2) the variables which affect the measured outcome, alongside
assumptions of the design that must be made, and distinctly

(3) the parts of the building which do not have an appreciable impact on
the result.  

This last point is given a bold font in particular because in my
experience, "Design Analysis" modeling occurs during the more fluid
stages of design which demand producing feedback at a relatively fast
pace, and the ability to holistically recognize what to focus on and
what not to spend hours defining is critical to that end.  I wager there
is a certain combination of both energy modeling experience and building
design experience that someone adept with "compliance modeling" would
not need, but really facilitates providing this sort of quick,
informative and accurate "design analysis" feedback.  

 

In light of the proposed categories of modeling services, let's step
back to the topic of what the broader term "energy modeler" means in
relation to this study:

 

If the entire JTA form & structure is built around defining and
weighting how much of any one "task" is performed for everything that
falls under the job description of "energy modeling"...  I find it hard
to imagine such a broad single distribution could be usefully applied
for a specific job or qualification description.   The JTA approach to
defining the job will likely be more constructive and useful if distinct
sets of "job blueprints" are developed for each of the three categories
described above.  

 

I recognize this is a wall of text, but this JTA study presently seems
too narrow to claim "identified tasks and weighting factors accurately
represent the job of a commercial building energy modeler."  Personally,
I find the present result to only vaguely describe the abilities and
tasks required of my role as an energy modeler, and I think the
consensus of feedback so far indicates others do not find this terribly
representative either of their unique skill sets and abilities.  A JTA
study developed to isolate and identify the different requirements and
duties for the 3 areas of energy modeling described above would be of
much more use for someone defining/ improving certifications, standards
and qualifications as well as defining the task at hand for solicitation
or hiring purposes.

Sincerely,

 

~Nick

 

PS: I notice in my final review of this that this commentary is coming
in a day late.  I trust those interested will put this and any following
discussion  from the lists in the right hands.

All,

While I agree with some of the concerns regarding the Skills, Abilities
and Attributes section of the document, I think that people are
overlooking the real substance of the document, namely, the Duties,
Tasks, and Steps that were outlined to define the energy modeling
process.

I would like to hear some specific comments regarding that portion of
the JTA. 

-Jason
