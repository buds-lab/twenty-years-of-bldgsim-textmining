Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED Platinum Hotel Baseline Queries
Message-ID: <CAPtACNXJ6q_xCRnZL9JURpMV6C+fzOBgkxu5rj+gdRUFceWSQQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all

I am currently working on Hotel projects targeting to achieve LEED Platinum.

The hotels are located in Singapore, thus Climate 1 related baseline shall
be used.

As indicated in 90.1 App.G 3.11A, System2, PTHP is used as baseline for
hotel guestrooms.
I am using IES VE, and its ApacheHVAC module to simulate air con system.
What shall be the part load control strategy for PTHP? Say, when air con
setting point is 24 degree C, what will PTHP working condition if internal
air drops to 22 degree C? shall the fan be stilling running or shut down
together with compressor?

Another odd thing is: for proposed design, when guestroom is unoccupied,
the fresh air will be running without reduction in amount, and the FCU fan
will be operating at medium speed which will result in small supply air
volume and small fan power.
What shall be the impact on baseline PTHP? or how shall I set the PTHP for
part load performance?

Any advice and comments are welcome.

Best Regards

Dear Colleagues:

First of all, Happy New Year! This email is a reminder about the upcoming deadline (31 January) for nominations for the IBPSA Awards.  The Board of IBPSA is seeking nominations for Awards to be presented at Building Simulation 2013, IBPSA's 13th biennial conference, in Chambery, France from August 26 to 28, 2013.

IBPSA Awards
The International Building Performance Simulation Association (IBPSA) makes three awards for outstanding work in the building performance simulation field. These awards are made on a biennial basis at each Building Simulation Conference, providing there is a qualified candidate.  In order to allow the awardees time to plan to attend, it is time to consider nominations for the up-coming conference in 2013.

The three categories awarded are:

IBPSA Award for Distinguished Service to Building Simulation
This award recognizes an individual who has a distinguished record of contributions to the field of building performance simulation, over a long period. The award consists of a certificate and $500 (US).

IBPSA Outstanding Young Contributor Award

Additionally, I would also like to remind you about the:
Student Travel Awards ? Supporting students to attend BS2013
wich also has a nomination deadline of 31 January 2013.

Travel to IBPSA Conferences can be an expensive business ? especially for students. In order to assist as many students as possible to participate in BS 2013 in Chambray, France, IBPSA will grant a number of travel awards of up to 1000USD to students presenting papers. The number of places is limited to a maximum of 5 grants and as a result is highly competitive.

The selection committee bases its decisions upon the following selection criteria:

?           overall quality of the paper;

?           relevance of contribution to the field of and/or furthering the effective application of building simulation;

?           need for financial assistance, evidenced in a letter of recommendation from the student?s supervisor/ advisor of studies (must be on university letterhead).


To be eligible, the student must be:

?           enrolled in a graduate programme related to building simulation at the time of the conference; AND

?           the thesis project must be directly related to building simulation.

Applications MUST be supported by a letter of recommendation from the student?s supervisor/ advisor of studies. Applications for the award must be made by 31 January, 2013 via e-mail to
pieter.dewilde at plymouth.ac.uk. The subject heading of the e-mail should be "Student Travel Award - paper XXX" where XXX is the three-digit reference number for your paper.
The e-mail application must include the following:
       The student's name;
       The name of the programme, department, faculty, and university;
       The title of the PhD or Master's research;
       The name of the student's supervisor(s)/ advisor(s);
       A scanned version of the faculty recommendation letter on university letterhead in PDF format. (Note that the original letter must be presented to the Conference Secretariat at the conference).

The selection committee will base its decision upon a review of the final manuscripts. Therefore, to be eligible the student MUST submit the paper by the full paper deadline of 31 January, 2013.
Nominations should be sent in the first instance to Pieter de Wilde as representative of the Awards Committee (pieter.dewilde at plymouth.ac.uk) by the closing date of the 31st January 2013.

We would like as many nominations as possible, so please contact me to discuss a possible nomination if required.

Does anyone have pricing information for Trombe walls handy from recent
projects? While I'm particularly looking for costs pertaining to
unventilated Trombe walls, any pricing information should be useful.

Thank you,

When building with phase change materials for thermal mass rather then
concrete cost savings can be had--   (or so I have been told by builders)
You might make an excel workbook and price out each part to see for your
self but I seem to remember a price in the range of $120 per square foot
after design/install using 8 inch concrete and a bit less for PCM.

This really depends on how you design it. If you treat it as an ass on system then it could get expensive. However - if you can integrate it into the building design - (I worked on a building design with 8" concrete Trombe Walls that were used for lateral bracing as well as load bearing) - it doesn't have to be a cost add.

This really depends on how you design it. If you treat it as an ass on system then it could get expensive. However - if you can integrate it into the building design - (I worked on a building design with 8" concrete Trombe Walls that were used for lateral bracing as well as load bearing) - it doesn't have to be a cost add.

Thanks for clarifying the typo ... actually, the first, mistyped email may have done a better job of explaining how most folks try to design Trombe' walls...especially when trying to simulate them since most simulation programs do a lousy job of this...hence I'd go with the first email.

Message-ID: <CAJ3R_V-FqSzmoRrPCF4imXmWxA1ySf8tbz_J9hQ-8SwHG5Hs=w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Community,

Again, I am coming to you for input in my efforts to make EnergyPlus run
faster.

As Nathaniel Jones suggested, I would like to consider not just the current
bottlenecks in EnergyPlus simulations, which are ran from models generated
by designers considering the limitations of the software and its
capabilities; I would like to know where you would like to get more
detailed, precise or accurate data from a simulation run, but accept lesser
data in the interest of getting your job finished in a limited amount of
time.

To boil it down, I'll ask my question this way: *if you could choose one
area in EnergyPlus to speed up, what would it be?  Another way of putting
it: where would you like more detail in your models, but you simplify in
order to reduce simulation execution time?*
*
*
Many thanks for your help and Happy New Year --

Message-ID: <50E78A43.2020305@whiteboxtechnologies.com>

I've developed quite a few (perhaps the earliest)  residential prototypes in my former 
days at LBNL: (1)  5 single-family and townhouse models for DOE (1981-1987),  (2) 66 
multi-family models for the Gas Research Institute (1985-1987), and (3) 120+  
single-family models for GRI (1988-1992).  I've also adapted the  single-family building 
model as the basic model behind the RESFEN program, and kept it updated  through 2008  for 
DOE's EnergyStar Window  analysis.

I have paper copies of the technical reports, and still functioning copies of the DOE-2.1E 
input files and parametric procedures.  I can upload these if there is still interest in 
this 20-year old work.
Other sources you should consider are :
   (1) Building America Program at NREL  ("Building America Performance Analysis 
Procedures", by Hendron, Anderson, et al. 2004)
   (2) the DEER program in California ("DEER - Database for Energy Efficient Resources", 
California Energy Commission, http://www.energyca.gov/deer)

I think if you're sticking only with EnergyPlus models, you will be missing out on a lot 
of previous work and experience.

My other comment is to not get too distracted by a multitude of building models that 
differ by code-required R-values, as seems to be the case with the PNNL IECC files. In my 
work, I've regarded these as simply permutations of a single model depending on location 
and vintage.  For example, the single-family building  model I now use for my window 
analysis is parameterized so that the building size, shell thermal integrities, and even 
number of floors are macro inputs feeding a single master model.  That to me was the only 
way to manage large data bases with tens of thousands of runs.

 Energy Modeling - Jan 30/31, Dallas
Message-ID: <50E78C8D.5070507@lbl.gov>

Building Energy Modeling: a Public-Sector Roadmap
*
*Open workshop hosted by the US DOE National Laboratories

Jan 30-31, 2013, Dallas Sheraton Hotel
*
*In the Spring of 2011, Rocky Mountain Institute hosted a two day summit 
that dealt with innovation in building energy modeling (BEM). 
Identifying BEM as a key enabling technology for building energy 
efficiency, the summit aimed to create 2-5 year roadmaps for significant 
aspects of BEM including software platforms, methods and processes, 
supporting resources, market drivers, and education. This workshop will 
attempt to define BEM priorities and strategies for a public sector road 
map of activities for the next 3-5 years. Topics for discussion include:

- Which currently important and emerging use cases of BEM need public 
support?

- Which areas of BEM need additional basic research, measurement, or 
validation?

- What are realistic and strategic goals for EnergyPlus functionality, 
speed, use, and user-support?

- What are realistic and strategic goals for supporting software tools 
like OpenStudio?

- How does the public sector push standards and interoperability?

- How can the public sector collect, vet, and organize data to help BEM 
practitioners?

- How can the public sector help scale BEM education and training?

- What are the most productive ways for public entities to collaborate 
with the private sector?

This open workshop will be held at the Dallas Sheraton immediately 
following the ASHRAE Winter Meeting and all who would like to provide 
input or contribute to the discussion are encouraged to participate. The 
first half-day session will be from 1pm to 6pm on Wednesday, Jan. 30, 
2013. The second half-day session will be from 8am to 12noon on 
Thursday, Jan. 31, 2013. So that we can get an estimated head count for 
planning purposes, please inform Caroline Hutchinson 
<chutchinson at lbl.gov> if you expect to attend.

I'll tell you one.  This happens on every energy modeling project.  The 
architect says "Why are you charging me to compute load calculations, 
and you are charging me more to do an energy model?  Why can't you get 
the loads from the energy model?"

And I always have to say something like "A loads calc model with 
sufficient detail to get the room by room loads we need for design is 
way too detailed for an energy model.  If we use a load calcs model for 
energy calcs, the progress would be too slow and the answers would not 
be more accurate."  And this I know from experience.

It would be nice to enter room by room information and have it spit out 
load data for sizing equipment and air flows, but use some different way 
of zoning for the energy calcs.  Maybe a way to identify rooms with 
similar load profiles that would be considered a single room for the 
purposes of the energy calculations.  Then of course, have a report for 
design loads and equipment sizing.

Sounds hard to me, but hey, you asked...

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Current limitations in building energy modeling and
	simulation
Message-ID: <FC1586506FC3D647A8CEAB83BA211A6902DE9FE7@CH2MBX01.ch2.comcast.net>

In my opinion, since Randall got me thinking.... (and not completely on the topic of execution speed)
Most modeling effort in much of the world appears to be spent currently on new building models.  I expect and hope that this will change and the focus will change to existing building performance.  These, however, are VERY different activities!

For energy models of new or not-yet-built buildings:

1.       The most effort is spent on input preparation and output review.

a.        Input preparation will be faster for models imported from IFC-compliant BIM tools once that's a common feature for GUIs like DesignBuilder, Simergy and OpenStudio

b.      I suspect that almost all new buildings will use BIM within the next few years, so that part of the problem may disappear.

2.       Output review is another matter.  I cannot quite imagine how modelers who do not have detailed reporting of individual nodes and energy at each timestep can conduct quality checking.  EnergyPlus has this capability, I use it on every project and would (probably) never consider doing otherwise.  Nonetheless, I think that the creation of all those variables may consume some processing time.  Perhaps that can be improved?

a.        A related topic that probably has nothing to do with execution speed is that the detailed output is not very "user friendly".  Formatting is primitive, for one thing, and it's only available in text format.

b.      There are some 3rd party graphical review tools, but they seem limited to review of a single variable at a time.  I am probably going to try using Universal Translator (www.utonline.org<http://www.utonline.org>) for this purpose shortly.  It's main purpose in life is analyzing data logger files, but that's not too different than reviewing an energy model's output.  Has anyone got a great, multi-variable solution for output review?

3.       I have mentioned in the past on this forum that if you prepare input carefully, and manage run times properly, execution time is not critically  important. (e.g., run only Design Days until output looks believable, add complex systems after checking simpler systems, etc.)
I  won't ever complain about faster execution time (!), but since Geof has been asked to make it a lot faster, I'm wondering for whom the execution time has been a problem?

For existing buildings that have utility consumption data, the same basic problems present themselves in a very different fashion:

1.       Input preparation cannot be imported from BIM. It may need to be hand-created by field investigation because there are no drawings whatsoever.

a.       The requirements for precise representation of geometry are not the same.  Every tiny reveal or dormer need not be described for the model.  Every construction detail and material is not always known.  Glass emissivity and filler gas are also not known.  This means the geometry and, to some extent, materials can be simplified - perhaps greatly.  They normally do not affect the model significantly, especially when compared to all the other variables.

b.      All of the schedules, diversity patterns and control settings still need to be part of the input, however, and these are very time-consuming to develop.  There is software now available ( e.g., www.retroficiency.com<http://www.retroficiency.com>) which analyzes utility data and infers a lot of useful information.  This is especially powerful if your site has an interval meter (records usage hourly or more frequently).  "Infer" is not the same as "know", but it is extremely difficult to get reliable data about building operation, even from people who work at the building!  Check out the cool chart of interval data that I've attached and tell me when the people arrive and leave each day :).  A Building Management System, properly used, can also help a lot, but too few of those are taken full advantage of.

c.       In short, input preparation is a big job, but is probably one for a GUI, not the calculation engine.

2.       Output review, assuming that you correctly define the energy systems, has a new and different focus.  Not only must the model correctly define the actual energy systems, but it must result in the same energy use and energy use pattern as the energy meters.

a.       For starters, I am convinced that you must use the actual weather which occurred for the meter billing period.  A quick comparison recently suggests that 10-20% of energy use can be affected by using actual vs. TMY weather data. Why live with that uncertainty?

b.      I am also convinced that it is well worthwhile to measure key energy consumers so as to eliminate more uncertainty.  You'll never know exactly what the infiltration rate is, but it's easy to measure major fan and pump power, for example.

c.       That leaves only a 100-500 or so remaining variables to tweak in order to get a good match between model-predicted and meter-measured energy!  "A good match" includes high correlation (at least) for monthly energy in addition to annual energy.  This is not a trivial effort.

d.      Assuming that you understand which variables will affect the "match" problem positively, THIS is where execution speed is a VERY BIG DEAL.  Easily, you may have dozens (or hundreds) of full year simulations until you get a "good match".

e.      Because existing building energy models have so many unknowns, it seems to be the case that less calculation rigor is needed.  Why spend the time to model a complete energy balance every 15 minutes when you are guessing about the schedule last Spring, the room setpoints, the COP of the 20 year old chiller and the condition of the poorly maintained steam traps?  Once again, there are lights on the software horizon (Retroficiency is one, but there are others) which are attempting to use simplified models.  These may be all that's needed, but it's early in their development and the "votes" are not all counted.

That's all for now.  Can you tell that I think the future of energy modeling is in existing buildings?  I am certain that some of you are far ahead of me in that area, but I hear very little about it in my corner of the USA.  I'd love to hear more!

I'll tell you one.  This happens on every energy modeling project.  The architect says "Why are you charging me to compute load calculations, and you are charging me more to do an energy model?  Why can't you get the loads from the energy model?"

And I always have to say something like "A loads calc model with sufficient detail to get the room by room loads we need for design is way too detailed for an energy model.  If we use a load calcs model for energy calcs, the progress would be too slow and the answers would not be more accurate."  And this I know from experience.

It would be nice to enter room by room information and have it spit out load data for sizing equipment and air flows, but use some different way of zoning for the energy calcs.  Maybe a way to identify rooms with similar load profiles that would be considered a single room for the purposes of the energy calculations.  Then of course, have a report for design loads and equipment sizing.

Sounds hard to me, but hey, you asked...

Hello Community,

Again, I am coming to you for input in my efforts to make EnergyPlus run faster.

As Nathaniel Jones suggested, I would like to consider not just the current bottlenecks in EnergyPlus simulations, which are ran from models generated by designers considering the limitations of the software and its capabilities; I would like to know where you would like to get more detailed, precise or accurate data from a simulation run, but accept lesser data in the interest of getting your job finished in a limited amount of time.

To boil it down, I'll ask my question this way: if you could choose one area in EnergyPlus to speed up, what would it be?  Another way of putting it: where would you like more detail in your models, but you simplify in order to reduce simulation execution time?

Jim:

I agree with your sentiment that modeling of potential retrofits to existing buildings demands of an analyst somewhat of a different skillset than that required for modeling new construction. This is because, in my opinion, most existing buildings contain operable systems are in some way 'broken' (i.e. malfunctioning control systems, poorly balanced energy distribution systems, unintended simultaneous heating and cooling, etc., etc.).  An analyst/modeler wanting to represent these defects needs a  firm grasp of how older analogue equipment and controls (lighting, HVAC, service water) are supposed to operate before one can judge how a system is actually operating.  This is not so much of a concern in modeling for new construction, as we assume equipment will be installed, commissioned, etc. to operate much closer to the ideal conditions that quasi-steady state simulations impose.

Furthermore, for modeling existing 'out of control' systems in buildings (only with the intent of seeing the ROI for improving them), one also needs a firm grasp of how to 'trick' the particular simulation engine into abstracting the energy consumption effects of the particular defect. For example, in eQUEST, one way to 'model' zero benefit simultaneous heating and cooling loads is to develop custom schedule driven process loads to 'hang' from the appropriate fluid loop. While possible, this is harder than it should be to do and fraught with error. I think our community would benefit if standardized methods for common 'retro-commissioning' measures could be developed and adopted, and that then tool vendors could then incorporate interfaces to accomplish the methods.

The good news is that data acquisition costs for supporting these sorts of 'pre-processed' simulation calculations continues to get cheaper and easier.  I'd love to hear from others in the forum on, (for creating accurate models of existing buildings, and when a building does not have a EMCS capable of trend configuration), what types of data acquisition hardware are people having success with? For me, the simple stand-alone HOBO U series loggers (temp, humidity, motor status) have provided sufficient short term data to significantly improve model quality.

To address your question in 2b below, I suggest you take a look at (2) different (free) data visualization tools that I am aware of:


1)      DVIEW (stand-alone executable)

2)      Energy Charting and Metrics Tool - ECAM (MS Excel Add-in)

A few comments on each -

DVIEW can produce the types of plots you shared, and much more. It can import a structures csv file, but is limited to viewing 8760 rows of data (put in as many columns as you want). Because of the 8760 limitation, it is not useful at all for sub-hourly simulation results unless the results are sampled to hourly. Having said that, it integrates quite well with eQUEST 'custom' hourly reports, which are quite extensive.

An improved version of ECAM has recently been posted to the web. ECAM, is a much more generic and less restrictive data visualization tool, which works best for analyzing hourly of finer data streams . While it can do many things, I've discovered that one of its strengths for simulation 'true-up' is the flexible creation of 'load profiles' from generic data sets.  Think of dataset1 as measured, real world data, and dataset2 as model output data.  If dataset is driven by an AMY weather file, load profiles for an overlapping period of time (January, weekdays, for example) from both streams should visually match. If not, begin the sleuthing process.. And, more interestingly, with ECAM the two datasets do not need to be at the same frequency.

Let's keep the dialogue moving! I know I am learning.

All the Best,

_Chris

Dear Colleagues:

It is our pleasure to announce FutureBuild, an international conference and networking event dedicated to the design of the built environment 2030-2050 and beyond. Building on our special issue in Building and Environment in 2012 we want to keep looking into the future, but now with a wider scope. This event will investigate what radical and transformative technologies and ideas might be being employed by that date, with a focus on the whole building, energy systems, communities and occupants. FutureBuild will take place in the city of Bath, United Kingdom, from 4 to 6 September 2013. Our website is now available at www.future-build.net<http://www.future-build.net/>. A call for abstracts is open and can be found on the webpages, with deadline for abstracts: 1 February 2013.
We would be happy to see some solid input from the BLDG-SIM communitiee and encourage you to submit a contribution.

Best regards,

HI All,

With the IBPSA chapter meeting, LBNL modelling workshop, and ASHRAE
conference being held here in Dallas, I think it is a good opportunity for
the area building simulation folks to meet/network during this time and see
if there is any interest in setting up an IBPSA chapter along the lines of
other big cities, where we can have presentations/discussions related to
modelling topics of regional interest.

I would be happy to coordinate a short meeting before/after any of the
above events.

Please email offline if interested.

Thanks

Hello all,
I wanted to make one clarification to this announcement. We are holding elections for officers and once elected, the officers name the executive board directly. So, individuals don't run for president, vp, treasurer, etc... Sorry for any confusion this may have caused.

Also, some people have asked for information about the winter meeting in Dallas. Details can be found on our website: http://www.ibpsa.us/meetings.shtml

Thanks and I hope to see y'all in Dallas.

Best,

Shanta Tucker

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Help Review Energy Efficiency Measure List for ASHRAE
	1651-RP
Message-ID: <50EDDC23.5080602@gard.com>

For ASHRAE research project 1651-RP, we are trying to 
assemble a comprehensive list of energy efficiency measures 
that can be considered for new buildings covered by 90.1 
except for renewables. The project is titled: "Development 
of Maximum Technically Achievable Energy Targets for 
Commercial Buildings  (Ultra Low Energy Use Building Set)". 
Later we will be looking for the combination of measures 
that will result in the lowest  possible energy consumption 
for each building type using EnergyPlus.

Attached is a spreadsheet that describes the 320 energy 
efficiency measures gathered to date along with a report 
describing how the spreadsheet was assembled. The report 
also recommends enhancements to EnergyPlus. After we finish 
compiling the list, we will be choosing a subset of measures 
to simulate.

Your help is requested to add measures that are missing from 
the "EEMs" tab of the spreadsheet. Column A, the name of the 
measure, and Column D, the description, are the most 
important. When you add measures, if possible, please also 
add a web or literature source that describes the measure on 
the  "References" tab. Your input on any other portion of 
the spreadsheet is also welcome.

To learn more about how the list was assembled and the 
meaning of each column, a conference call is scheduled for 
Wednesday January 23 at 11am central. If you are interested 
in attending, please let me know and I will send you the 
connection information.

Please feel free forward this email and attachment to others 
who might be interested but please CC me when you do so I 
can keep track of who has received it.

If you have suggestions, it would be most helpful if you 
replied only to me with a revised version of the spreadsheet 
attached containing additional rows at the bottom of each 
tab with your input.

Please provide input no later than February 20, 2013.

Thank you for your help.

Jason

Message-ID: <OF3DD792CE.844F316E-ONC1257AEF.0030FD6E-C1257AEF.00317088@bdab.nu>

I am involved in a project where we will evaluate a number of buildings in 
an architecture competition. It is a prestigious project in a rather cold 
climate with over 150 invited architects from all over the world. The 
project will use BREEAM and the rating level is probably Outstanding. In 
this stage we are not interested in evaluating the technical systems but 
the building itself (shape, orientation, fa?ade, windows, solar shading, 
thermal bridges and room location). 

I now wonder if someone has made something similar and if that is the 
case, what kind of information you required from the architect and how you 
made the evaluation?

I am thinking of asking the architects to present heat loss (through 
windows, fa?ade, ground, roof, openings, airflow and thermal bridges), the 
cooling need due to solar radiation and positive heat from the sun (during 
heating period). We will also ask for daylight autonomy (considering 
glare, control systems and human behavior), daylight factor for 
representative rooms, view to the outside and PPD-index according to ISO 
7730.

We will provide input in form of climate data, inside temperature, 
internal loads, schedules, light levels, internal surface reflectance, clo 
and met. We will probably not specify how the information should be 
determined (calculation method and software) but the method and all 
assumptions must be presented so it is possible to evaluate and compare 
it.

I am also thinking of requiring other key metrics (average U-value, 
Envelope area per Volume and so on) to be able to compare the different 
buildings together with a 3D-model of the building.

Any suggestions are welcome, we want this completion to be as fair and 
correct as possible and help making an excellent building in all aspects.

Sincerely,

Max Tillberg

Message-ID: <CAEB-Yar5-yJoREeqWY4Nb0aFVYJYvCB-sLH1v-mpzBAW+CoVkA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

*From the user's guide, the fan power should be removed from the
standard EER*rating of packaged cooling systems.



A 15-ton packaged rooftop single-zone system having an EER of 8.6 (COP of
2.5) is

specified for a building. The following table gives the design
specifications. How should

this be modeled?

Equipment parameter                               Value

Net Cooling Capacity (Btu/h)                   174,000

Total Packaged Unit Input Power (W)        20,128

EER                                                         8.64

Gross Cooling Cap (ARI conditions)         182,000

The supply fan power is the difference between the gross and the net cooling
capacity.


*So my Query is that Gross Cooling capacity ( ARI Condition ) is same
for all Packaged system of any tonnage ??? Is it standard one or what
???? ........Like i have 1.5 *

*ton of PTAC system, so for 1.5 ton of PTAC system also its gross
cooling capacity is same 182,000????*

Max,
You will need to specify the base HVAC, heating and cooling plants,
efficiency, occupied and unoccupied interior set points and schedules
system so that it is the same for all submissions.  You may also want to
define inputs for economizers, night time pre-cooling, whether natural
ventilation is used, etc.  These again should be the same for all
competitors if the envelope is the only component being considered.
Are you interested in just the most energy efficient envelope that can be
conceived by a architect or a cost effective, practical envelope design for
the local environment (i.e. something that can actually be constructed with
local technologies and skills).  If so, you will need first cost and life
cycle data on the envelope materials, components and assemblies as a factor.
In addition, since shading is an evaluation criteria you will want the
competitors to define very specifically any shading control schemes and how
they were modeled to optimize the use and trade-off between solar heating
and day lighting.

Jason:

I read your message with interest, and started creating new measures, before I realized that you clearly state that this list (and presumably the Title/Purpose/Scope of 1651-RP) is meant to cover measures that apply only to NEW BUILDINGS. In other words - you are not looking for measures that would be appropriate for EXISTING buildings...

Given the sheer amount of existing building square footage in our nation's building stock, and the sheer amount of potential for improvement within the poorer performing actors in this stock, is there any activity that you are aware of where a similar effort as to 1651-RP is being undertaken, yet focused on existing buildings? A few scenarios of the types of measures I am referring to may help describe what I mean..

M1: A 4-pipe VAV AHU with a steam (or hot water) heating coil in series with a cooling coil and where the 2-way modulating coil control valves for either (or both) coils fail to close tightly, either because of actuator/linkage issues and/or valve seat erosion).  Repair/replace damaged control valves/valve assemblies.

M2: A Rooftop VAV AHU where the sequence of operations defines the unit outdoor air dampers to close tightly during unoccupied conditions, but where in reality the dampers fail to close completely due to actuator/linkage issues. Repair/replace damaged damper actuator/linkage.

While these may seem like retro-commissioning issues that we do not need modeling tools to help us understand how to 'fix', it's my belief that incorporating simulation-driven estimates of savings from 'fixing' these measures along with other capital improvement measures into packages of improvements can allow us to create more holistic retrofits in existing buildings that achieve deeper savings while yet providing an attractive overall ROI, and ultimately moving the centroid of energy use intensities in our entire built environment.  I hate to see measures like I describe get 'left behind', and yet want to understand if there is a way I can still contribute.

All the Best,

_Chris

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Help Review Energy Efficiency Measure List for ASHRAE 1651-RP

For ASHRAE research project 1651-RP, we are trying to assemble a comprehensive list of energy efficiency measures that can be considered for new buildings covered by 90.1 except for renewables. The project is titled: "Development of Maximum Technically Achievable Energy Targets for Commercial Buildings  (Ultra Low Energy Use Building Set)".
Later we will be looking for the combination of measures that will result in the lowest  possible energy consumption for each building type using EnergyPlus.

Attached is a spreadsheet that describes the 320 energy efficiency measures gathered to date along with a report describing how the spreadsheet was assembled. The report also recommends enhancements to EnergyPlus. After we finish compiling the list, we will be choosing a subset of measures to simulate.

Your help is requested to add measures that are missing from the "EEMs" tab of the spreadsheet. Column A, the name of the measure, and Column D, the description, are the most important. When you add measures, if possible, please also add a web or literature source that describes the measure on the  "References" tab. Your input on any other portion of the spreadsheet is also welcome.

To learn more about how the list was assembled and the meaning of each column, a conference call is scheduled for Wednesday January 23 at 11am central. If you are interested in attending, please let me know and I will send you the connection information.

Please feel free forward this email and attachment to others who might be interested but please CC me when you do so I can keep track of who has received it.

If you have suggestions, it would be most helpful if you replied only to me with a revised version of the spreadsheet attached containing additional rows at the bottom of each tab with your input.

Please provide input no later than February 20, 2013.

Thank you for your help.

I'm not terribly satisfied with the clarity of terminology in the example provided...

The basic concept is "gross (nominal) cooling energy" - "fan energy input" = "non-fan cooling energy"

Put another way, you can ultimately arrive at a cooling EIR (independent of fan energies) by subtracting the fan kW from the system total kW at ARI conditions.

Trying to present this using capacities instead of kW is only confusing the point they mean to make, as I understand it.

Hope that helps!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Gross cooling capacity at ARI conditions

Hello All,


>From the user's guide, the fan power should be removed from the standard EER

rating of packaged cooling systems.







A 15-ton packaged rooftop single-zone system having an EER of 8.6 (COP of

2.5) is



specified for a building. The following table gives the design

specifications. How should



this be modeled?



Equipment parameter                               Value



Net Cooling Capacity (Btu/h)                   174,000



Total Packaged Unit Input Power (W)        20,128



EER                                                         8.64



Gross Cooling Cap (ARI conditions)         182,000



The supply fan power is the difference between the gross and the net cooling

capacity.



So my Query is that Gross Cooling capacity ( ARI Condition ) is same for all Packaged system of any tonnage ??? Is it standard one or what ???? ........Like i have 1.5



ton of PTAC system, so for 1.5 ton of PTAC system also its gross cooling capacity is same 182,000????

Subject: [Bldg-sim] About infiltration in a LEED analysis.....
Message-ID: <95F0356A0810C44AB56ADD48FA44184101BA7A6A@greengo>

Hi all,

 

I'm modeling a building for a LEED certification (renovation) for a
building in France. 

 

Normally in my baseline and proposed models I put the same infiltration
(n50 = 0.14 ach) for both buildings. Even that this is an unreal case
(since the renovation leads to an improve in the permeability of the
building). 

 

I do that because, first 0.14 is the minimal infiltration allowed by
French regulations, and second because I have never seen in the ASHRAE
documentation about improve infiltration in current buildings. Even if
the improve of the infiltration rate can make me gain a lot of
improvement between baseline and proposed buildings energy
requeriements.

 

Anyone of you have already experience in this specific point? Any
justification is required from the USGBC if I want to change the
infiltration between baseline and proposed buildings?

 

Thanks in advance for any comments/help on this,

 

Regards,
David GARCIA-SANCHEZ

Hi David!

Matching infiltration rates between models is in line with the present LEED requirements and referenced standards.  To my understanding, doing otherwise is not prohibited, but if you wish to differentiate proposed and baseline infiltration rates you will need to furnish an explanation (exceptional calculation) along with the rest of your model documentation to the satisfaction of your LEED EAc1/EAp2 reviewer.

I haven't direct experience submitting such differentiating calculations specifically for LEED review (I hope others can chime in!), but some searching of the term "infiltration" in the onebuilding mailing list archives will lead you to multiple methods/papers/cited sources for different approaches.  I personally reference ASHRAE 2001 Fundamentals to address tightness improvements on a broad level (further explanation/citation in the archives).

Since you mentioned "renovation," I would be extra cautious to review the most current LEED guidance available regarding where and to what extent you apply any such "leakage improvement" factors to infiltration rates - there may be unintended effects on what is expected for the modeled constructions (baseline vs. actual).

Best of luck!

Jason,

Thanks for the information.  You mean I can now throw out the old copy of the blue AF 
manual that I've been keeping for all these years?
I haven't checked out this new revision, but I would like to point out that the blurb on 
the Web says that there are 800 worldwide locations
in the manual, whereas the ASHRAE Weather Data Viewer contains over 5,600.  On a cost per 
station basis, the two are exactly the same
($17/800 == $119/5600 = 2.1 cents per station)  :-) :-)

Here's some food for thought (and sorry to hijack this thread):

I was at an AEE meeting yesterday that included a discussion by a local
meteorologist about the increased variability and extremes that are being
predicted in weather models for the future (i.e. climate change).  

What is the feeling in the bldg-sim community as to how useful 1973-1996
binned average data will continue to be when it comes to predicting building
operation, loads, and performance in a future that is expected to be more
variable and extreme with regards to weather?

Is anyone preparing a new set of TMY data with more extremes?  Are design
day criteria being updated from the historical ASHRAE 1% values?  Will 95
drybulb/78 wetbulb (for Boston anyway) no longer be the standard?

Just wondering if our current methods of building simulation (and design)
may leave something to be desired. 


Sincerely,
Alec Stevens

Or you can easily make your own bin data using TMY3 data files and MS Excel's Histogram function. Works like a charm and the cost is right :) and you can set the bins to match whatever bin size you want. Use some Pivot Table functionality and you can cut those bins down to only occuppied hours etc.

Apparently there are weather trends for, say, the most recent 10 years which are different than the 30 years looked at by a TMY file.  I suspect this could be due to urban heat patterns as well as the general rise in global temperatures.  I don't know if these are significantly different than what a TMY or the AFM 88 blue manual might show.
If you want to investigate, I'm pretty sure that Weather Analytics has a data set offering of actual weather data for 10 years for thousands of locations.  They offer file formats for various of the energy modeling platforms, but also have a .CSV format that could be "binned".

Depending on how much custom binning you are looking to do, Rohini, DView
is one option for data visualization for various time scales, etc.

True they are 30 years worth of data (a tad longer than 10 years) points with the extremes thrown out but you are using binned data. How accurate of a calculation are you really getting anyway? If one were using bin data I would suggest that throughing out the extremes would be warranted.

The problem with TMY files is that they only have 8760 observations. You should use at least 10 years of actual hourly air temperatures to get a good sample, particularly the extremes.

Hi Robert!

If you mean scheduling for lighting and/or occupancy, 90.1 does not strictly require anything.  You can use whatever makes sense for the building so long as you are matching between baseline and proposed.

That said, if you are uncomfortable developing your own scheduling and/or are looking for guidance, ASHRAE has published out schedules of this nature that the 90.1 User's manual references.  They are a series of tables from 90.1-1989 for different building occupancy types (School/Warehouse/etc).  None of these building types is "4-story dorm," but you could likely reference "Hotel" and/or "health/institutional."  If you don't have 90.1-1989 handy on your shelves, I know these schedules are freely available incorporated as part of the Washington State Energy Code (2009), and possibly other places.

It's probably worth mentioning the mechanical designer (where applicable) is probably the most defensible source for any project-specific scheduling.  I don't always feel it's a requirement, but getting the mechanical designer's input in writing for any scheduling you're unsure of is always a safe bet.

It's also worth mentioning the schedules generated in a weighted occupancy fashion by eQuest (which I think you're referencing) have in my experience gone largely unchallenged over many LEED projects.  The results are often quite reasonable when you do not have anything more specific to reference.  If I recall correctly some time ago, discussions across one of these mailing lists revealed the schedules "under the hood" used for each occupancy type are in fact referencing ASHRAE-based sources/research.

~Nick

Does anybody know off the top what the ASHRAE 90.1 Lighting Occupancy is for High/Mid (four story) Residential Apartment/Dorm (private baths)??????

I'm using "Building Area Multi-Family" now, but I'm not sure that's right, and I can't find anything better.

Hoping for a better answer....

Chris,



Great observation!



I come at it from a slightly different perspective:

What are the commonalities and differences between measures for new construction vs. retrofit vs. RCx and optimization?



Even in new construction there is significant potential impact from properly designed, programmed and optimized controls (Cx). And in retrofit there is opportunity for capital replacement that could be viewed as `new' construction.



With respect to RCx, new construction design and Cx, the ability to simulate `sloppy' or broken controls is seriously lacking. Especially within whole building tools that can also capture the enormity of potential interactions. We do it with bin analysis and load profiles built from `experience' simulation tools (Equest)  or actual performance data (using inverse methods) . Absent real data (as in new construction) a simulation tool, based on fundamental analysis, is the next best way to create such profiles. But unless the analysis is integral to the simulation, capturing the interactions that may, or may not matter, is difficult, if not impossible.



Can we get there?    What do you think?

Jason:



I read your message with interest, and started creating new measures, before I realized that you clearly state that this list (and presumably the Title/Purpose/Scope of 1651-RP) is meant to cover measures that apply only to NEW BUILDINGS. In other words - you are not looking for measures that would be appropriate for EXISTING buildings...



Given the sheer amount of existing building square footage in our nation's building stock, and the sheer amount of potential for improvement within the poorer performing actors in this stock, is there any activity that you are aware of where a similar effort as to 1651-RP is being undertaken, yet focused on existing buildings? A few scenarios of the types of measures I am referring to may help describe what I mean..



M1: A 4-pipe VAV AHU with a steam (or hot water) heating coil in series with a cooling coil and where the 2-way modulating coil control valves for either (or both) coils fail to close tightly, either because of actuator/linkage issues and/or valve seat erosion).  Repair/replace damaged control valves/valve assemblies.



M2: A Rooftop VAV AHU where the sequence of operations defines the unit outdoor air dampers to close tightly during unoccupied conditions, but where in reality the dampers fail to close completely due to actuator/linkage issues. Repair/replace damaged damper actuator/linkage.



While these may seem like retro-commissioning issues that we do not need modeling tools to help us understand how to 'fix', it's my belief that incorporating simulation-driven estimates of savings from 'fixing' these measures along with other capital improvement measures into packages of improvements can allow us to create more holistic retrofits in existing buildings that achieve deeper savings while yet providing an attractive overall ROI, and ultimately moving the centroid of energy use intensities in our entire built environment.  I hate to see measures like I describe get 'left behind', and yet want to understand if there is a way I can still contribute.



All the Best,



_Chris

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Help Review Energy Efficiency Measure List for ASHRAE 1651-RP



For ASHRAE research project 1651-RP, we are trying to assemble a comprehensive list of energy efficiency measures that can be considered for new buildings covered by 90.1 except for renewables. The project is titled: "Development of Maximum Technically Achievable Energy Targets for Commercial Buildings  (Ultra Low Energy Use Building Set)".

Later we will be looking for the combination of measures that will result in the lowest  possible energy consumption for each building type using EnergyPlus.



Attached is a spreadsheet that describes the 320 energy efficiency measures gathered to date along with a report describing how the spreadsheet was assembled. The report also recommends enhancements to EnergyPlus. After we finish compiling the list, we will be choosing a subset of measures to simulate.



Your help is requested to add measures that are missing from the "EEMs" tab of the spreadsheet. Column A, the name of the measure, and Column D, the description, are the most important. When you add measures, if possible, please also add a web or literature source that describes the measure on the  "References" tab. Your input on any other portion of the spreadsheet is also welcome.



To learn more about how the list was assembled and the meaning of each column, a conference call is scheduled for Wednesday January 23 at 11am central. If you are interested in attending, please let me know and I will send you the connection information.



Please feel free forward this email and attachment to others who might be interested but please CC me when you do so I can keep track of who has received it.



If you have suggestions, it would be most helpful if you replied only to me with a revised version of the spreadsheet attached containing additional rows at the bottom of each tab with your input.



Please provide input no later than February 20, 2013.



Thank you for your help.



Jason

Dear Alec and colleagues

There is a niche of research that looks applies the climate change predictions from the meteorologists/climate change experts in building simulation. In the US, the seminal paper in that area has been written by Dru Crawley in the Journal of Building Performance Simulation, and that specific article is open access. DOI:10.1080/19401490802182079. For a wider international perspective, there is the special issue of Building and Environment that I did with David Coley last year (issue 55, 2012).

Here are my two-cents:

I think the idea of calculating design conditions or developing "typical year" weather data
using a long historical record, e.g., the past 30 years, needs to be re-evaluated in light of
global or regional climate change, as well as such irreversible trends as Urban Heat Islands,

Using longer time periods doesn't bring more accuracy in predicting future climate conditions
(after all, aren't we interested in only how buildings do in the future, and not the past?),
but only anchors us more in the past.

About 15 years ago, a meteorologist in ASHRAE TC 4.2 found that you need only 7 years
of data to overcome the stochastic year-to-year variations in the climate.  Therefore, I feel
that it's best to use a shorter time period, more like the last dozen, for these purposes.

That's what I've done for the California Energy Commission in creating the new CZ2010 Title-24
weather files, and what I will be doing to calculate design conditions for the same locations.

There's also been discussion in various places on using GCM (Global Circulation Models) to
calculate future weather and then develop design conditions or "future year" weather files.
I find these  methods too hypothetical for my tastes, and I'm sure those skeptics out there
would have a field day if we were to use them, so my position is to keep doing things the
old way with the actual historical data, but shorten the time periods to something more
immediate.

Last year, I did a study of the savings for window awnings,  where the client asked me to also
do the simulations using the hottest year over the past decade.  The results were quite 
noticeable.
The hottest year (judged by cooling degree-days) for 40% of the 50 US locations I studied were
in the last two years (2010 or 2011).  The cooling loads in many locations increased by 30-40%
(more in the north, less in the south).

Robert,
Nick is right on.
Two more schedule resources for energy models are:
1. The COMNET Commercial Building Energy Modeling Guidelines and Procedures
available online at: http://www.comnet.org/. The schedules in this document
are identical to and taken directly from the ASHRAE 90.1 User's Manual.
2.  The U.S. Department of Energy Commercial Reference Building Models of
the National Building Stock produced by NREL.  They can be obtained from
the following link: http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/46861.pdf.  The
schedules are found in Appendix B of this document and were developed from
resources as far back as 90.1-1989.  The schedules include several extended
building sizes and types not included in 90.1.  The notes say some of the
schedules have been modified based on NREL's research, experience and
judgement.
Finally, I would take the recommendation of Nick one step further and try
to get agreement from the Owner on things like operating and occupancy
schedules in an OPR type of document or something.  Especially if you are
trying to make an estimate of future energy cost/consumption which is not
always a good idea without some kind of disclaimer.
Hope this helps, good luck,
Dennis

I tried 4 times to log on to the meeting.  each time it said "meeting 
has not started yet  please wait"
on the fifth try the message said  "license limit exceeded contact host"
on the 6th try it is back to  Not Started  Yet.........
I just wanted to point out that natural ventilation is like that.........
Sometimes you open the windows and nothing happens, other times you have 
to find the guy with the window crank >>.>.

If the interest is in getting historical time series of weather, there's now plenty of detailed data in the public domain, particularly for the US. For example, NREL has produced the new NSRDB that has the historical weather data 1991-2010 for 1454 US locations.
That's right, 29,000 station-years of detailed hourly data in the TMY3 CSV format. That's not so remarkable once it's realized that to create any typical year weather file one has to first produce the historical time series. It's just now that NREL, bless their hearts, has decided to release publicly what had been internal intermediate data for creating the TMY3 files.

I suspect this could be due to urban heat patterns as well as the general rise in global temperatures.  I don't know if these are significantly different than what a TMY or the AFM 88 blue manual might show.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Binned weather data for US (not the equest weather
	file)

I don't understand the concern about needing to do binning of multiple number of years, and why that would affect the accuracy of a bin program any more than saying we should do hourly simulations with a dozen historical years instead of with a single typical year file. The loss in accuracy must be around a percent or so.

I feel that typical year weather files have been unfairly characterized as bland, misses the extremes, etc. That would be true if the typical months were picked based only on their averages. However, the TMY methodology developed by NREL is much better than that. It picks the month with a frequency distribution closest to the long-term FD. So, it doesn't throw out extremes at all; it just tries to replicate the long-term distribution with the best that can be done using a single-year of record.  

If you compare the 0.4% condition between the historical record and a typical year weather file, you'll find statistical scatter rather than bias.  

In summary, the only conclusion one can make about typical year files is that their frequency distribution is more coarse because they've only got 8760 observations. From the analysis that I've done, I found the biggest effect and concern is with the period of record chosen in their creation. All the other perceived defects, weighting scheme, are quite secondary.

Works like a charm and the cost is right :) and you can set the bins to match whatever bin size you want. Use some Pivot Table functionality and you can cut those bins down to only occuppied hours etc.

This is the first I've heard of NREL having (weather data ?) "around the world in csv file 
format".   Outside of a few selected countries or regions (SWERA, China, India), I was not 
aware that NREL was working on weather files for non-US locations.  Furthermore, their 
international focus has been mainly on estimating solar radiation, not on developing 
weather files per se.  If you know of such data at NREL, please share more information on 
what they are or where the files are available.

I do know that the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) has put a lot of weather data from 
around the world online as the ISH (Integrated Surface Hourly) data base   
http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/isd/index.php

In fact, the new NSRDB (National Solar Radiation Data Base) 1991-2010 that I mentioned 
earlier  is now accessible both at a NREL site
http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/1991-2010/SolarAnywhere/

Don't forget to deal with the fan heat as well.

gross cooling capacity - fan heat = net (rated) cooling capacity

 

gross cooling capacity is therefore higher than net capacity, and the
gross EIR will be higher due to both the reduction in electrical  input
(fan input taken out) as well as the higher cooling capacity.

 

Since the fan input energy and heat load are still dealt with, albeit
separately, the net capacity and net EIR are still as expected (rated).

 

I hope this is clear.

 

Best regards,

 

Mike

I'm not terribly satisfied with the clarity of terminology in the
example provided...

 

The basic concept is "gross (nominal) cooling energy" - "fan energy
input" = "non-fan cooling energy"

 

Put another way, you can ultimately arrive at a cooling EIR (independent
of fan energies) by subtracting the fan kW from the system total kW at
ARI conditions.

 

Trying to present this using capacities instead of kW is only confusing
the point they mean to make, as I understand it.

 

Hope that helps!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Gross cooling capacity at ARI conditions

 

Hello All,

 

>From the user's guide, the fan power should be removed from the standard
EER
rating of packaged cooling systems. 
 
 
 
A 15-ton packaged rooftop single-zone system having an EER of 8.6 (COP
of
2.5) is
 
specified for a building. The following table gives the design
specifications. How should
 
this be modeled?
 
Equipment parameter                               Value
 
Net Cooling Capacity (Btu/h)                   174,000
 
Total Packaged Unit Input Power (W)        20,128
 
EER                                                         8.64
 
Gross Cooling Cap (ARI conditions)         182,000
 
The supply fan power is the difference between the gross and the net
cooling
capacity.
 
So my Query is that Gross Cooling capacity ( ARI Condition ) is same for
all Packaged system of any tonnage ??? Is it standard one or what ????
........Like i have 1.5 
 
ton of PTAC system, so for 1.5 ton of PTAC system also its gross cooling
capacity is same 182,000????

Message-ID: <0373D25B536A0846862A0635516750B448E8D79B@extprdmbx03.bentley.com>

ASHRAE Technical Committee 4.2 regularly (every 4 years) updates the design conditions data in the ASHRAE Fundamentals (latest version 2009).



Chapter 14 Climatic Design Information contains all the normal cooling and heating design conditions (1, 2, 99, 99.6) but a lot more.  And the WDView program allows users to look at frequencies, joint frequency matrices, custom bin the data, and calculated degree-days to any base.



A new version of the Fundamentals (2013) is due out this spring with updated period of record (1986-2010) and a new version of the WDView program (5.0).



The design conditions ARE showing the changes in climate due to urbanization and climatic trends.



The soon-to-be-published Chapter 14 says:



" Differences from Previously Published Design Conditions

?         Climatic design conditions in this chapter are generally similar to those in previous editions, because similar if not identical analysis procedures were used. There are some differences, however, owing to a more recent period of record (generally 1986-2010 versus 1982-2006). For example, when compared to the 2009 edition, 99.6% heating dry-bulb temperatures have increased by 0.31?F (0.17?C) on average, and 0.4% cooling dry-bulb temperatures have increased by 0.18?F (0.10?C) on average. Similar trends are observed for other design temperatures. The root mean square differences are 0.74?F (0.41?C) for the 99.6% heating dry-bulb values and 0.70?F (0.39?C) for 0.4% cooling dry-bulb. The increases noted here are generally consistent with the discussion in the section on Impacts of Climate Change.

?         Further details concerning differences between design conditions in the 2009 edition and 2005 edition are described in Thevenard (2009). Differences between the 2005 edition and the 2001 edition are described in Thevenard et al. (2005). Differences between the 1993 and previous editions are described in Colliver et al. (2000)."



  And



"Effects of Climate Change

...

For 1274 observing sites worldwide with suitably complete data from 1977 to 2006, selected design conditions were compared between the period 1977-1986 and 1997-2006. The results, averaged over all locations, are as follows:

?         The 99.6% annual dry-bulb temperature increased 2.74?F (1.52?C)

?         The 0.4% annual dry-bulb increased 1.42?F (0.79?C)

?         Annual dew point increased by 0.99?F (0.55?C)"





As Joe Huang and others have noted, NREL recently updated the NSRDB to contain data through 2010.  The NSRDB (US locations only) was the source for the TMY3 and a project to create TMY4 is planned.  Environment Canada is also updating the CWEC (Canadian locations) to more recent period of record and more locations as well.  The recently released ASHRAE IWEC2 provide another 3,012 locations outside of the US and Canada.



As others have noted, there are also AMYs (actual meteorological years) with records up until the last few months available from different sources now including gridded data to 1 kM.



It's a lot better than where we were before 2005 with TMY2 (only 239 US locations) and CWEC (originally 55 and now 80 locations)!

Here's some food for thought (and sorry to hijack this thread):



I was at an AEE meeting yesterday that included a discussion by a local meteorologist about the increased variability and extremes that are being predicted in weather models for the future (i.e. climate change).



What is the feeling in the bldg-sim community as to how useful 1973-1996 binned average data will continue to be when it comes to predicting building operation, loads, and performance in a future that is expected to be more variable and extreme with regards to weather?



Is anyone preparing a new set of TMY data with more extremes?  Are design day criteria being updated from the historical ASHRAE 1% values?  Will 95

drybulb/78 wetbulb (for Boston anyway) no longer be the standard?



Just wondering if our current methods of building simulation (and design) may leave something to be desired.





Sincerely,

Alec Stevens

I agree with Joe's assessment here on the length of time for a TMY file. 
Since we construct TMY files on demand, we are actually thinking about 
making the number of years a user selectable variable..."Build from the last 
___ years of data".  Would that be useful?

Here are my two-cents:

I think the idea of calculating design conditions or developing "typical 
year" weather data
using a long historical record, e.g., the past 30 years, needs to be 
re-evaluated in light of
global or regional climate change, as well as such irreversible trends as 
Urban Heat Islands,

Using longer time periods doesn't bring more accuracy in predicting future 
climate conditions
(after all, aren't we interested in only how buildings do in the future, and 
not the past?),
but only anchors us more in the past.

About 15 years ago, a meteorologist in ASHRAE TC 4.2 found that you need 
only 7 years
of data to overcome the stochastic year-to-year variations in the climate. 
Therefore, I feel
that it's best to use a shorter time period, more like the last dozen, for 
these purposes.

That's what I've done for the California Energy Commission in creating the 
new CZ2010 Title-24
weather files, and what I will be doing to calculate design conditions for 
the same locations.

There's also been discussion in various places on using GCM (Global 
Circulation Models) to
calculate future weather and then develop design conditions or "future year" 
weather files.
I find these  methods too hypothetical for my tastes, and I'm sure those 
skeptics out there
would have a field day if we were to use them, so my position is to keep 
doing things the
old way with the actual historical data, but shorten the time periods to 
something more
immediate.

Last year, I did a study of the savings for window awnings,  where the 
client asked me to also
do the simulations using the hottest year over the past decade.  The results 
were quite
noticeable.
The hottest year (judged by cooling degree-days) for 40% of the 50 US 
locations I studied were
in the last two years (2010 or 2011).  The cooling loads in many locations 
increased by 30-40%
(more in the north, less in the south).

We have some good discussion at the NY IBPSA meeting last night about TMY
vs. AMY weather data, and looking at both on projects even though AMY data
is not common in U.S. standards / rating systems.

Any thoughts here? Do others run concurrent simulations using AMY data?

Since ASHRAE is already adjusting design day information (see Dru Crawley's post earlier today), I think the best use for AMY data in our industry will be an energy model of an existing building for which you want to match actual vs predicted energy use.  Using the actual weather eliminates a significant unknown and allows you to focus on the other uncertainties as you calibrate the model.

We have some good discussion at the NY IBPSA meeting last night about TMY vs. AMY weather data, and looking at both on projects even though AMY data is not common in U.S. standards / rating systems.

Any thoughts here? Do others run concurrent simulations using AMY data?

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Binned weather data for US (not the equest weather file)

Here are my two-cents:

I think the idea of calculating design conditions or developing "typical year" weather data
using a long historical record, e.g., the past 30 years, needs to be re-evaluated in light of
global or regional climate change, as well as such irreversible trends as Urban Heat Islands,

Using longer time periods doesn't bring more accuracy in predicting future climate conditions
(after all, aren't we interested in only how buildings do in the future, and not the past?),
but only anchors us more in the past.

About 15 years ago, a meteorologist in ASHRAE TC 4.2 found that you need only 7 years
of data to overcome the stochastic year-to-year variations in the climate. Therefore, I feel
that it's best to use a shorter time period, more like the last dozen, for these purposes.

That's what I've done for the California Energy Commission in creating the new CZ2010 Title-24
weather files, and what I will be doing to calculate design conditions for the same locations.

There's also been discussion in various places on using GCM (Global Circulation Models) to
calculate future weather and then develop design conditions or "future year" weather files.
I find these  methods too hypothetical for my tastes, and I'm sure those skeptics out there
would have a field day if we were to use them, so my position is to keep doing things the
old way with the actual historical data, but shorten the time periods to something more
immediate.

Last year, I did a study of the savings for window awnings,  where the client asked me to also
do the simulations using the hottest year over the past decade.  The results were quite
noticeable.
The hottest year (judged by cooling degree-days) for 40% of the 50 US locations I studied were
in the last two years (2010 or 2011).  The cooling loads in many locations increased by 30-40%
(more in the north, less in the south).

I'm personally a big proponent for modeling location-specific AMY weather whenever there is calibration to historical data to consider, but that certainly doesn't apply to every model or standard.  I don't consider AMY/TMY to be an either-or proposition as much as it makes sense to use either as appropriate to the analysis at-hand.

I have myself used both kinds of weather files with the same model, to different ends.  If you are trying to make long-term ROI decisions, averaged weather data is absolutely preferable to AMY as you don't want to over- or under-account for the weather extremes that occur over any given period in isolation.  If you are calibrating an existing building to past utility bills and measurements, that calibration can be performed with much more certainty using AMY.

As to using 30+ years of averaged data vs. a smaller averaged set of more recent data for TMY, taking any position on the matter seems like "timing the market" on some level to me...  I'm very curious to hear the opinions of the weather scientists and researchers more informed than myself.  I wonder (out loud) whether we should consider the anticipated lifespan of the building and how long the owner will be paying the utility bills in making such a decision on a per-project basis?  Perhaps a school district occupying the same building for many decades is better served making decisions with a more conservative set of averaged weather data (not necessarily "shorter," but with amplified extremes)?

So far as LEED/standards like the 90.1 performance rating method are concerned, I think TMY remains preferable to AMY to avoid "cherry picking" a year which would benefit the demonstrated performance.  I don't think the duration of years involved in the TMY data should at least have some minimum (if that's not spelled out somewhere already), if not an explicitly required number of years, for the same reasons.

That's what I've done for the California Energy Commission in creating the new CZ2010 Title-24
weather files, and what I will be doing to calculate design conditions for the same locations.

There's also been discussion in various places on using GCM (Global Circulation Models) to
calculate future weather and then develop design conditions or "future year" weather files.
I find these  methods too hypothetical for my tastes, and I'm sure those skeptics out there
would have a field day if we were to use them, so my position is to keep doing things the
old way with the actual historical data, but shorten the time periods to something more
immediate.

Last year, I did a study of the savings for window awnings,  where the client asked me to also
do the simulations using the hottest year over the past decade.  The results were quite
noticeable.
The hottest year (judged by cooling degree-days) for 40% of the 50 US locations I studied were
in the last two years (2010 or 2011).  The cooling loads in many locations increased by 30-40%
(more in the north, less in the south).

What is the feeling in the bldg-sim community as to how useful 1973-1996
binned average data will continue to be when it comes to predicting building
operation, loads, and performance in a future that is expected to be more
variable and extreme with regards to weather?

Is anyone preparing a new set of TMY data with more extremes?  Are design
day criteria being updated from the historical ASHRAE 1% values?  Will 95
drybulb/78 wetbulb (for Boston anyway) no longer be the standard?

Just wondering if our current methods of building simulation (and design)
may leave something to be desired.

The updated Engineering Weather Data to cover 1973-1996 and put it on a CD

http://ols.nndc.noaa.gov/plolstore/plsql/olstore.prodspecific?prodnum=5005

It is only $17 now.

You might check ASHRAE's Weather Data Viewer that can produce binned
temperature data for over 5,000 locations around the world.  It's not
free, though, costs $119.

I would like to clarify that ASHRAE TC 4.2 has not adjusted the design 
day information in the HOF.  What Dru meant I think is that global 
climate change and urban heat island effects are being seen the design 
day information as the tables are being periodically updated every 3-4 
years.  There has been no change in the design day calculation procedure 
that's related to capturing more recent results or projecting trends 
into the future.  The closest that TC 4.2 have come is to list the trend 
for each station over recent years.

Hey Rohini,

Why not download the weather files and bin them yourself using Excel. It's
free and it's not rocket science (hint: COUNTIFS will do the trick)

Check NREL's website if you want TMY3 data (either search for a single
location or download all of all stations - 228 MB - 2GB when extracted)
http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/1991-2005/tmy3/

The list of stations is in TMY3_StationsMeta.csv


And if you need daily temperature for example, check NOAA's website (also
free)

Best,
Julien

Message-ID: <50F079A1.6070002@whiteboxtechnologies.com>

The topic of using actual year versus typical year weather data (please 
note my rant about nomenclature at the end of my post below, with 
apologies to Steve Cornick :-) ) was discussed last October, so maybe we 
need to create a FAQ on this topic ?   which reminds me that ASHRAE TC 
4.2 has a FAQ about various types of weather data and their appropriate 
use ( see http://tc42.ashraetcs.org/faq.html#6 ).  To me, the 
distinction is obvious - if you're evaluating actual building 
performance, use the actual year weather file; if you're evaluating 
hypothetical building performance (as for standards compliance or LEED 
rating), use a typical year weather file.

This topic is separate from the one about the best method to create a 
typical year or calculate design conditions.   This is as much an 
engineering question as a meteorological one, so I'm afraid the insight 
you will get from climatologists will be limited.  When I worked with 
meteorologists in several countries, esp. in the US and China, I was 
struck that the concept of a "design day" or a "typical year" was 
something outside their experience.

I agree that using an actual year weather file to evaluate a building's 
performance is "cherry picking" the data, but is anyone really doing 
that?  Wasn't that why typical year weather files were developed in the 
first place more than 30 years ago?  My interest in seeing the time 
period for developing typical years or calculating design conditions 
reduced from 30 years is because I think the results would then respond 
better to ongoing trends instead of lagging by a decade or more.  It 
would be an easy hypothesis to test and I'm thinking of doing that for a 
selected number of US stations, i.e., create typical years of different 
time periods and see which time period best matched the results for the 
following X number of years.  As for the minimum acceptable number of 
years to create a typical year, that's been implicitly decided by ASHRAE 
TC 4.2 and NREL as either 7 or 8 years.

The idea of a more conservative set of averaged weather data seems 
problematic to me.  It's hard to define what's conservative because it 
would depend on the building as well as the climate, and any effort to 
massage real data would open up a whole can of worms.  You would be much 
better off to simply run the building over the past so many historical 
years, and pick the year with the highest energy consumption to do your 
projection.

Joe

my rant on weather nomenclature (as promised earlier):  I prefer saying 
"typical year"  when talking about the general concept, and use TMY only 
when referring specifically to the TMYX data sets or methodology 
developed by NREL.  I find using TMY as a general term confusing and not 
fair to all the other typical year data sets, such as TRY,  WYEC, IWEC, 
CZXXRV, DRY, etc.  I also find the term AMY odd, as if real weather data 
needed to be branded  (rant over).

Chris,

The focus of the 1651-RP research project is just on new 
building construction but I think it would be great if a 
similar project on existing buildings was started. I 
certainly welcome your input on new construction measures.

Perhaps you can start a similar spreadsheet for existing 
building measures, I think others on BLDG-SIM might find it 
valuable.

Jason, it would be interesting to have an ECM list tied to the type of
"Design Guidelines" algorithm developed for passive design measures by the
Energy Design Tools team at UCLA (copied), having an ability to filter ECMs
using project parameters.

 Techniques for Natural Ventilation and Thermal Comfort Prediction
Message-ID: <1B23446CBF250648A2FC775DE3FE7E800FC2686D@OC11expo28.exchange.mit.edu>

Dear colleagues and friends in the Boston area:

The Building Technology Program at MIT and IBPSA Boston are pleased to announce a presentation by Professor Malcolm Cook (Loughborough University) on January 31st at  noon EST in the Long Lounge (building 7 room 431) at MIT (http://whereis.mit.edu/). Everyone is welcome.

Christoph


Low Energy Buildings: CFD Techniques for Natural Ventilation and Thermal Comfort Prediction
Malcolm's presentation will cover both his research and consultancy activities. This will cover the work he has undertaken during his time spent working with architects on low energy building design, with a particular focus on natural ventilation and passive cooling strategies, and the role computer simulation can play in this design process. Malcolm will talk about the simulation techniques employed, as well as the innovative passive design principles that have led to some of the UK's most energy efficient buildings. In addition to UK building projects, the talk but will include work Malcolm completed as part of the design of the LEED Gold award winning Harm A. Weber Academic Center at Judson University, in Elgin, near Chicago. This building, which comprises office and library space, employs a hybrid ventilation and cooling strategy which exploits the maximum benefit from natural ventilation before reverting to air-conditioning during the harsh winter and peak summer months. Malcolm will also talk about recent research projects, including his work on Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of unsteady flows in naturally ventilated buildings and the development of a new simulation system which couples CFD with a model of human physiology and thermal comfort.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Interpretation in AHU for baseline and proposed model in
	LEED.
Message-ID: <95F0356A0810C44AB56ADD48FA44184101BF224B@greengo>

Hi all !

 

I have a tricky question concerning Modeling in LEED that I'm quite sure
is a common problem concerning the interpretation of LEED baseline
systems definitions. In the paragraph 6.5.6.1 of ASHRAE 90.1-2007. The
requirements of use a heat recovering in the baseline system are stated.
Normally we should not overpass 2 400 l/s in flow rate and 70% of
outside air intake. If we have both statements in our systems the
baseline system must not include heat recover. (and since baseline is
the building that we are comparing our proposed systems the gap between
baseline and proposed are wider).

 

In the building which I'm modeled I have the AHU divided by north system
and south system (both AHU's serve offices in all floors). One of the
AHU meets the requirements to avoid air recovering in the baseline
system, the other doesn't.

 

Since AHU's of baseline systems are supposed to be modeled by floor I
should take heat recover or not?

 

For me what I should do is to "merge" both air requirements of both
proposed Air handle units and make a ratio by floor, so I can see which
floor of my proposed systems meet the requirements and which not... is
this correct?

 

Thanks of any advice on this.

 

Regards,


David GARCIA-SANCHEZ

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Internal mass modeling guidance in E+?
Message-ID: <CAETHmJ7e3eDegj87de_6BcqFK378YoYmF83xE4ahYZ55WFv5gA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear colleagues,

I'm looking into furniture/internal mass modeling in energy models
particularly within the environment of EnergyPlus but also not limited to
that.

I have two questions I guess:

1, Are there any modeling guide or reference building report that may give
recommendations/instructions on how to represent furniture/internal mass
inside a building if there is no much detailed information? I guess all I'm
asking is are there any published data-set, or default values in terms of
material property and area to represent furniture like what could be easily
found about schedules and occupancy density?

COMNET modeling guide has only one paragraph about it and it mentioned "The
interior thermal mass and modeling assumptions in the baseline building
shall be the same as the proposed design."
Currently what I have is from Building America House Simulation Protocols:
"The internal mass of furniture and contents shall be equal to 8 lb/ft2 of
conditioned floor space. For solar distribution purposes, lightweight
furniture covering 40% of the floor area shall be assumed."

2, DOE reference commercial buildings have internal mass objects in the
idf. file, where does the information come from?

Appreciate your input!

Best,

Qinpeng

Although we would like to have all building inputs to be well-documented, this is still 
far in the future, especially for those inputs having to do with lifestyle and behavior.  
On internal mass, the proverbial story is to call a moving company and ask how much stuff 
do they haul in a typical move.  I actually had a researcher do that 20 years ago, and she 
came up with a number of 5.5 lbs/ft2  for a residential building.  I see that the Building 
America has upped that to 8 lbs/ft2.  I have no grounds to either believe or disbelieve that.

I've heard even less discussion on the internal mass of commercial buildings.  As the 
original developer of the DOE Reference Buildings, I can say that all those inputs for 
internal conditions (mass, shading, occupancy schedules, etc.) are based on "engineering 
judgment" (at least in my original work)

It's not particularly difficult to survey an appropriate number of houses/buildings and 
come up with something more defensible, but sad to say, nobody wants to support that 
because it's not regarded as serious research.  About 20 years ago, a colleague at FSEC 
and I came up with a Work Statement for ASHRAE TC 4.7 to survey a collection of homes and 
develop prototypical operating conditions.  It got approved but just at the verge of going 
out for bid, ASHRAE Research decided to withdraw it.

I believe that E+ and predecessors take/took what ever was described
as "internal mass" and parsed it into an equivalent "partition" of
some "equivalent"  area. This can lead to some counter intuitive
results. Most might expect that "internal" or "thermal" mass is going
to moderate energy transfer ("store"). But suppose I describe a
banquet hall full of folding mdf or plywood tables (light weight).
Compared to an empty room, the area available to absorb radiation and
convect it to the room is increased by easily 1/3. All of a sudden the
room is "fast" and energy gains are translated into cooling loads much
more quickly.

So let's agree with Joe that your question can be answered by "walking
around." In looking around my office I find that one partition is
covered with book cases and that the other side of the partition is
also covered with books. If I thought this was an important feature
that needed to be modeled (which I don't and which isn't) I would not
describe any internal equivalent mass, I would simply describe a
partition made up of books-air space-gyp board wall-air space-books.

But why do I think this is irrelevant additional work? I can weigh
some books to determine their density. We think books are heavy but
imagine putting an equivalent volume of concrete in your backpack.
Then they are not so "thermally massey". Also the books never receive
direct sunlight and the temperature in my office varies little because
it is in my heavily insulated, air tight home. Since the guzinta
equals the guzouta over time and since the guzinta and guzouta, even
for this massive double book lined partition, are near zero because
the materials are at constant temperature, more or less, the mass of
the books is not very important to the room energy balance.

I don't know what thermal mass is anyway. The term must have evolved
partly from passive solar designs, where energy storing materials
exposed to the sun are important,  and from the brick trade
association who left a confusing legacy of claims that a masonry house
had a higher R-value because of the "thermal mass." Mind you I think
bricks are great, I have some myself. However, there is nothing in the
definition of R-value that is labeled "brick."

My apologies Dr. Wang. I expect that what I have just said is more or
less useless as an answer to you questions. However, a productive
guide to a first approach might be found in:

Consider a Spherical Cow: A Course in Environmental Problem Solving, John Harte

It is easier to bound a problem than to defend anybody's guess at the
mean. The correct answer always seems to be "It Depends."

There's also an issue here about whether or not there's any modeling of
internal partitions or fixtures included in your model. My personal
experience in modeling residential models is that they always lag more than
you expect, so I've regularly responded by jacking up the internal mass. I
certainly can fit metered HVAC data a lot better when I add mass beyond
what the BABM suggests. I've guessed that's because my partitions don't
quite match the amount of mass we're interacting with.

I get what Doug is saying that there isn't much temperature change
occurring in his bookshelf, but when you have literally several tons of
exposed mass, even a degree or two of temperature change is quite a bit of
heat. Those granite counters currently in fashion do something for the
building mass.

What's funny about this is that the conventional rule of thumb is that
residential construction is "light" and has little impact from mass, while
commercial buildings are "heavy" and have lots of mass impacts. My personal
experience in studying this is that mass is extremely important in
residential construction because they "float" a lot of the time and also
have higher solar gains than commercial spaces.

One possible area of fruitful research I've thought about is to try and get
some utility direct load control data and look at the "response time" of
residences in terms of how long it took to have the temperature rise a
certain amount when the HVAC system was constrained. You'd at least get
some good data about how responsive the houses are supposed to be and alter
what you can in your models to get them to better match real life (whether
or not you actually figured out the root cause of the problem in the
model).

I've had the same experience when comparing simulation results to measured indoor 
temperatures for a typical house in California. The actual house temperatures were 
substantially more flattened and lagged compared to what the simulation showed.  It may be 
that getting the right number on the amount of internal mass might not necessarily result 
in a house model that responds similar to a real building.  Then you have to decide 
whether to "tune" the model to be physically correct or thermally correct!

Perhaps mass could be related to occupancy quite easily. After all every
person needs a few square feet of desk, possibly some filing.

There is probably quite a simple arithmetic formula that holds true for
most situations, the arguments of which might be:
? occupant density
? desk space per occupant
? material thickness
? extra shelving required?

Ignore anything with less mass.

If you come up with an excel formula, I'd like a copy ;o)

Hi Folks:

This has to do with modeling in general.

I have a Window Film manufacturer with a product called Enerlogic VEP35 window film. It is apparently applied to the inside of a window.

The manufacturer claims that this product lowers the U-Value of single pane glass (1/4" or 6 mm) from 1.109 to 0.6. And with no air space between the film and the glass. "Revolutionary new technology"

Has anyone ever run into this product before? Why does this claim sound "too good to be true" ??

Thanks.

Hi John,

As I understand the topic (at a baser level than others on these lists), R-values / U-values are a kind of flawed metric in and of themselves when discussing window films.  Films can perform magical feats when it comes to cutting solar loads (perhaps turning your building into a 2-way mirror in the process), but quantifying that result into a U-value is a loopy path at best, as no thin/transparent coating prevents heat transfer by conduction in the same sense typical insulation does.

Regardless of manufacturer claims, I would be averse to modeling the effects of such films as a "u-factor factor" if charged with determining ROI.  Also keep in mind solar loads aren't always a bad thing if we're talking annual energy bills.

Here's a (for cost?) paper that appears to be evaluating this exact sort of issue utilizing eQuest/WINDOW.  Abstract/highlights there are intriguing.  Possibly includes procedure you could draw from?  I recognize Rongxin from the mailing lists here - perhaps he could fill you in further?

I've modeled that film for an office building in wellington, nz. I was
pretty excited but unable to show overall building energy reduction sure to
the film. Need to run a one zone model and see if I can obtain savings in
particular conditions.

That said a 40% better u value is wild. If be excited about 5% over the
year.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Internal mass modeling guidance in E+?
I believe that E+ and predecessors take/took what ever was described
as "internal mass" and parsed it into an equivalent "partition" of
some "equivalent"  area. This can lead to some counter intuitive
results. Most might expect that "internal" or "thermal" mass is going
to moderate energy transfer ("store"). But suppose I describe a
banquet hall full of folding mdf or plywood tables (light weight).
Compared to an empty room, the area available to absorb radiation and
convect it to the room is increased by easily 1/3. All of a sudden the
room is "fast" and energy gains are translated into cooling loads much
more quickly.

So let's agree with Joe that your question can be answered by "walking
around." In looking around my office I find that one partition is
covered with book cases and that the other side of the partition is
also covered with books. If I thought this was an important feature
that needed to be modeled (which I don't and which isn't) I would not
describe any internal equivalent mass, I would simply describe a
partition made up of books-air space-gyp board wall-air space-books.

But why do I think this is irrelevant additional work? I can weigh
some books to determine their density. We think books are heavy but
imagine putting an equivalent volume of concrete in your backpack.
Then they are not so "thermally massey". Also the books never receive
direct sunlight and the temperature in my office varies little because
it is in my heavily insulated, air tight home. Since the guzinta
equals the guzouta over time and since the guzinta and guzouta, even
for this massive double book lined partition, are near zero because
the materials are at constant temperature, more or less, the mass of
the books is not very important to the room energy balance.

I don't know what thermal mass is anyway. The term must have evolved
partly from passive solar designs, where energy storing materials
exposed to the sun are important,  and from the brick trade
association who left a confusing legacy of claims that a masonry house
had a higher R-value because of the "thermal mass." Mind you I think
bricks are great, I have some myself. However, there is nothing in the
definition of R-value that is labeled "brick."

My apologies Dr. Wang. I expect that what I have just said is more or
less useless as an answer to you questions. However, a productive
guide to a first approach might be found in:

Consider a Spherical Cow: A Course in Environmental Problem Solving, John
Harte

It is easier to bound a problem than to defend anybody's guess at the
mean. The correct answer always seems to be "It Depends."

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Internal mass modeling guidance in E+?
There's also an issue here about whether or not there's any modeling of
internal partitions or fixtures included in your model. My personal
experience in modeling residential models is that they always lag more than
you expect, so I've regularly responded by jacking up the internal mass. I
certainly can fit metered HVAC data a lot better when I add mass beyond
what the BABM suggests. I've guessed that's because my partitions don't
quite match the amount of mass we're interacting with.

I get what Doug is saying that there isn't much temperature change
occurring in his bookshelf, but when you have literally several tons of
exposed mass, even a degree or two of temperature change is quite a bit of
heat. Those granite counters currently in fashion do something for the
building mass.

What's funny about this is that the conventional rule of thumb is that
residential construction is "light" and has little impact from mass, while
commercial buildings are "heavy" and have lots of mass impacts. My personal
experience in studying this is that mass is extremely important in
residential construction because they "float" a lot of the time and also
have higher solar gains than commercial spaces.

One possible area of fruitful research I've thought about is to try and get
some utility direct load control data and look at the "response time" of
residences in terms of how long it took to have the temperature rise a
certain amount when the HVAC system was constrained. You'd at least get
some good data about how responsive the houses are supposed to be and alter
what you can in your models to get them to better match real life (whether
or not you actually figured out the root cause of the problem in the
model).

I've had the same experience when comparing simulation results to measured
indoor temperatures for a typical house in California. The actual house
temperatures were substantially more flattened and lagged compared to what
the simulation showed.  It may be that getting the right number on the
amount of internal mass might not necessarily result in a house model that
responds similar to a real building.  Then you have to decide whether to
"tune" the model to be physically correct or thermally correct!

There's also an issue here about whether or not there's any modeling of
internal partitions or fixtures included in your model. My personal
experience in modeling residential models is that they always lag more than
you expect, so I've regularly responded by jacking up the internal mass. I
certainly can fit metered HVAC data a lot better when I add mass beyond
what the BABM suggests. I've guessed that's because my partitions don't
quite match the amount of mass we're interacting with.

 I get what Doug is saying that there isn't much temperature change
occurring in his bookshelf, but when you have literally several tons of
exposed mass, even a degree or two of temperature change is quite a bit of
heat. Those granite counters currently in fashion do something for the
building mass.

 What's funny about this is that the conventional rule of thumb is that
residential construction is "light" and has little impact from mass, while
commercial buildings are "heavy" and have lots of mass impacts. My personal
experience in studying this is that mass is extremely important in
residential construction because they "float" a lot of the time and also
have higher solar gains than commercial spaces.

 One possible area of fruitful research I've thought about is to try and
get some utility direct load control data and look at the "response time"
of residences in terms of how long it took to have the temperature rise a
certain amount when the HVAC system was constrained. You'd at least get
some good data about how responsive the houses are supposed to be and alter
what you can in your models to get them to better match real life (whether
or not you actually figured out the root cause of the problem in the
model).

I believe that E+ and predecessors take/took what ever was described
as "internal mass" and parsed it into an equivalent "partition" of
some "equivalent"  area. This can lead to some counter intuitive
results. Most might expect that "internal" or "thermal" mass is going
to moderate energy transfer ("store"). But suppose I describe a
banquet hall full of folding mdf or plywood tables (light weight).
Compared to an empty room, the area available to absorb radiation and
convect it to the room is increased by easily 1/3. All of a sudden the
room is "fast" and energy gains are translated into cooling loads much
more quickly.

So let's agree with Joe that your question can be answered by "walking
around." In looking around my office I find that one partition is
covered with book cases and that the other side of the partition is
also covered with books. If I thought this was an important feature
that needed to be modeled (which I don't and which isn't) I would not
describe any internal equivalent mass, I would simply describe a
partition made up of books-air space-gyp board wall-air space-books.

But why do I think this is irrelevant additional work? I can weigh
some books to determine their density. We think books are heavy but
imagine putting an equivalent volume of concrete in your backpack.
Then they are not so "thermally massey". Also the books never receive
direct sunlight and the temperature in my office varies little because
it is in my heavily insulated, air tight home. Since the guzinta
equals the guzouta over time and since the guzinta and guzouta, even
for this massive double book lined partition, are near zero because
the materials are at constant temperature, more or less, the mass of
the books is not very important to the room energy balance.

I don't know what thermal mass is anyway. The term must have evolved
partly from passive solar designs, where energy storing materials
exposed to the sun are important,  and from the brick trade
association who left a confusing legacy of claims that a masonry house
had a higher R-value because of the "thermal mass." Mind you I think
bricks are great, I have some myself. However, there is nothing in the
definition of R-value that is labeled "brick."

My apologies Dr. Wang. I expect that what I have just said is more or
less useless as an answer to you questions. However, a productive
guide to a first approach might be found in:

Consider a Spherical Cow: A Course in Environmental Problem Solving, John
Harte

It is easier to bound a problem than to defend anybody's guess at the
mean. The correct answer always seems to be "It Depends."

Perhaps mass could be related to occupancy quite easily. After all every
person needs a few square feet of desk, possibly some filing.

There is probably quite a simple arithmetic formula that holds true for
most situations, the arguments of which might be:
? occupant density
? desk space per occupant
? material thickness
? extra shelving required?

Ignore anything with less mass.

If you come up with an excel formula, I'd like a copy ;o)

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Window Film Product Claims

Hi Folks:

This has to do with modeling in general.

I have a Window Film manufacturer with a product called Enerlogic VEP35
window film. It is apparently applied to the inside of a window.

The manufacturer claims that this product lowers the U-Value of single pane
glass (1/4" or 6 mm) from 1.109 to 0.6. And with no air space between the
film and the glass. "Revolutionary new technology"

Has anyone ever run into this product before? Why does this claim sound
"too good to be true" ??

Thanks.

John Aulbach

It sounds like a good product, but bad physics (or at least bad explanation of the physics invoved). Low emissivity really affects radiative heat transfer much more than it does conductive transfer. They need to get this tested by an independent accredited third party if they want to be taken seriously.

Hi John,

As I understand the topic (at a baser level than others on these lists), R-values / U-values are a kind of flawed metric in and of themselves when discussing window films.  Films can perform magical feats when it comes to cutting solar loads (perhaps turning your building into a 2-way mirror in the process), but quantifying that result into a U-value is a loopy path at best, as no thin/transparent coating prevents heat transfer by conduction in the same sense typical insulation does.

Regardless of manufacturer claims, I would be averse to modeling the effects of such films as a "u-factor factor" if charged with determining ROI.  Also keep in mind solar loads aren't always a bad thing if we're talking annual energy bills.

Update on Window Film Product:

I DID find the product listed in the NFRC Database. But, as you can see, it only lists one U-Value for each product. Not a Delta U. So I think the product is rated for Shading Coefficient and VT at that particular U-Value.

I also have an email into their Product rating director to confirm my suspicions.

Come, Watson, Come, The game is afoot..

Hi Folks:
?
This has to do
with modeling in general.
?
I have a Window
Film manufacturer with a product called Enerlogic VEP35 window film. It is
apparently applied to the inside of a window.
?
The manufacturer
claims that this product lowers the U-Value of single pane glass (1/4" or
6 mm) from 1.109 to 0.6. And with no air space between the film and the glass.
"Revolutionary new technology"
?
Has anyone ever
run into this product before? Why does this claim sound "too good to be
true" ??
?
Thanks.

I know that LEED is way more than just energy, and energy is way more 
than just equipment, but just for a basis, what SEER and EER do people 
have to use to get 10% better than ASHRAE 90.1 to qualify for LEED?  I 
also know that you don't have to use ASHRAE 90.1, but that is what I am

So, what does it take?

All,

We were looking at weather data files for Sydney Australia,
(Sydney.Airport.947670), and we found that there is a of about an hour for
some of the data in AUS_NSW.Mascot-Sydney.Airport.947670_RMY versus
AUS_NSW.Sydney.947670_IWEC.

Please see the attached jpg. Looking at the direct normal radiation and
radiation-rose you can see that sun-rise and sun-set in RMY file happening
earlier. When combined with solar position calculations based location and
time this makes the sky to appear to be skewed, with more radiation  from
the east. We found a similar pattern in AUS_NSW.Sydney.947680_RMY weather
file.

Which weather file is the one that you suggest us to use for the analysis?

Is there a known difference between the RMY and IEWC standard that would
account for this?

Is it because Sydney is near the eastern edge of its time zone, and the RMY
standard is defined in terms of actual local time rather than ?solar time?
and the IEWC standard were defined in terms of solar time rather than local
time?

Regards,

Mostapha

I took a look at an old atlas and Sydney's near the middle of its time zone. Please keep 
in mind that the solar data in the vast majority of weather files is modeled, i.e., 
calculated from other parameters or satellite imagery, so they're quite dependent on the 
solar angle calculations.  I know that's the case with the IWEC, not positively sure about 
the RMYs, though.

I'm attaching a scratch version of the weather file for Sydney I created for the ASHRAE 
IWEC2 set (file sent in separate e-mail to just Mostapha,  I think I'm allowed to do 
that).  Please look at that for a comparison, and let me (and others) know what you find.  
The file is in text, and the columns are clearly identified.

A very simple way of looking at LEED & energy, which I come back to often for discussions on that level, is to consider a building's performance like a tripod with three important legs:  Lights, Mechanical, and Envelope.  If any of those legs is too short, the tripod falls over.

Building on that analogy, to do 10% better than a LEED baseline, a good starting place is to have at least:
-  10% better lighting (10% lower LPD), 
-  10% better HVAC & hot water heating (10% better efficiencies), and 
-  10% better envelope (10% more insulation in walls/roof, 10% better windows).  
For each of these, you can source the baseline/prescriptive levels from the standard of your choosing.

Overperforming in one area can sometimes make up for underperfomance in another, but with diminishing returns.  Amazing HVAC equipment/design has a harder time shining when you have a poor envelope and/or the lighting designer treats LPD's as a "budget" they have to use up.  For such reasons, it's advisable to always consider building performance in holistic fashion in early/broader discussions. 

That's my (simple) take anyway!

My current project has very good windows, "standard" walls, you're right 
about the lighting, it's right on budget (but residential doesn't really 
have a budget, so the small common areas are right on budget), better 
than standard roof.

I absolutely agree with you, Nick, on achieving 10% better, but all the 
trades point to the others.  It's kind of comical, actually.

I guess my question on this list could be rephrased, using your 
approach, as "What SEER is 10% better than SEER 13?"

Also the SEER only helps you while the A/C is on...meanwhile the lights are chugging along at "budgeted" rates every day eating away your 10% reduction in cooling end-use.

Robert,
SEER is a seasonal energy efficiency ratio and is unitless.  It is the "cooling
output during a typical cooling-season divided by the total electric energy
input during the same period":
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_energy_efficiency_ratio.  A unit with
10% or better seasonal cooling energy efficiency over a 13 SEER unit would
have a SEER rating of 14.3 or greater (1.1x13) if all other operating
parameters were held constant.  See link for definitions and other
references.

To answer the SEER question, 1.1*13 = 14.3, all things being equal.  (If you're talking heatpumps, consider your HSPF's as well for the heating season.)

Again, this is all a simplified guideline for early decisionmaking, but the situation you're describing with all trades "pointing fingers" is exactly the paradigm I'm advising to kick out the door early to ensure success as a team.  It's much harder to do later in the game!  

Building performance is a team effort, and a team can only do as well as the weakest link.  If and when someone I'm working alongside is stubbornly designing "in a bubble" to the detriment of the project, I consider it as the energy modeler's imperitive to demonstrate this to the rest of the team if necessary.

As an example: More than once I've been able to give lighting designers a big "ah-ha!" moment by showing how major even a small LPD reduction can be when mechanical and envelope designers are pulling their weight.  It can also be humbling when you consider the costs implications of a 10% reduction in installed lighting wattage against the equivalent effects of getting all the premium bells and whistles for the chiller plant.

Also the SEER only helps you while the A/C is on...meanwhile the lights are chugging along at "budgeted" rates every day eating away your 10% reduction in cooling end-use.

Nick,
I agree with you, and depending on what you are using as your evaluation
criteria throw in COP and other metrics as well.  If you have the
opportunity of working directly with the Owners early you should help them
set an energy target for the project or help them establish energy
efficiency standards for all energy using/consuming systems and components.
 A 10% improvement in your big three will not necessarily translate into a
10% improvement in total energy consumption of the whole building if that
is what Robert is trying to achieve.  It is a team effort and the owner has
to be at the top of the pyramid.  The owner has to be in the driver's seat
and buy into all of this in order to "burst the bubbles" of silo thinking
team members.  It is, after all, the owner's money.  Neither trades people
nor designers should be making decisions for the owner that the owner does
not understand or that does not meet the owners project requirements,
budget and expectations.

Dear Syed,

The NRC link does not work anymore but you will find a copy of the library under: C:\Daysim\Daysim_Lighting_Materials.lib. This is an Ecotect material library that can be loaded into Ecotect via User Preferences.

Best,

Christoph

Dear All,

I have downloaded the Daysim software and in the DAYSIM Getting Started manual, there is a reference to the global
material library at
http://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ie/lighting/daylight/daysim/docs/NRC_LightingL
ibrarySetup.exe.
which does not work. Can anyone please send the working link or the very setup? I will be very thankfull.

I suppose the modeling software and how it treats energy might have 
something to do with it too (Note to CA and TDV), but for starters the 
modeling software will look at actual conditions in the particular place 
where the project is located.  As an absurd case, if there was no 
cooling needed, an infinite SEER would show no improvement.  SEER is for 
"typical" and each project is not necessarily typical.  For somewhere 
with a high cooling demand, SEER should have a greater effect, but 
cooling is only a small part of the energy budget.

I can appreciate that with "10% better walls, 10% better windows (or how 
about 10% less windows), 10% lower lighting wattages, 10% more efficient 
hot water, all compared to the standard, you could get 10% better using 
a SEER 14.3, but I have never gotten that result.  I suppose that I need 
to look harder at the other legs on the stool.  For me, I need SEER 17 
to get to 10% better in California with a somewhat lopsided stool.  I am 
curious what experience others have.

The theoretical answer may be "Make everything else use 10% less energy 
than standard and have a SEER 14.3 AC unit, and you're done" but to be 
honest, that doesn't ever work for me.

Maybe a better question is; have you ever gotten 10% better than ASHRAE 
90.1 with a 15 SEER AC system?  In a real project with real people 
fighting over costs, etc.?

Dennis,

Not to nitpick too much, but while SEER is a ratio, it is not unitless.  It's the cooling 
extraction rate in BTU/hr, divided by the electricity consumption in Watts.  COP is a 
truly unitless number, and is  smaller than the SEER by the ratio of 3.413, which is the 
conversion of BTU/hr to Watts.

Robert,
Simple answer is "No" - that is my point - it more than likely never will.
 You have to include all of your proposed energy conservation measures that
you are likely to apply into a single model with your user and
climate/local specific schedules and profiles included to see what
the aggregated savings maybe.  You can run multiple models changing only
one component to do some sensitivity analysis to see what
variables/measures may give you more dramatic changes in total energy
consumption, cost, carbon  emissions, indoor comfort, life cycle cost, life
cycle assessment, etc.  (which ever your client and you are using as your
decision making criteria).
As for the question regarding 10% energy reduction using 15 SEER equipment:
I've gotten 10% better energy performance using 90.1 minimum SEER compliant
equipment and effecting change in lighting power density, lighting
controls, controllable plug loads and better envelope/less infiltration,
better ventilation and properly downsizing the mechanical systems.  You do
not always have to improve the mechanical efficiency of the HVAC equipment
to achieve an energy efficiency improvement target.  It is a whole building
analysis that the owner's O&M behavior can have a major impact on.
 Conversely, I've had bleeding edge efficiency and complexity in the energy
using systems at some facilities and the buildings perform worse than an
minimum code compliant building  or a local median EUI when a custodian who
knows how to turn things off at night could have done better - when the
owner does not understand how the design team intended the building to be
operated when they made their analysis.  For example, I just investigated a
net zero energy house that was donated to an international non-profit.  It
has 22 SEER geothermal heat pumps, an envelope so tight it had no air
measurable leakage at 80 pascals, LED lighting, solar water heater, energy
recovery ventilator, solar PV, SIPS panel wall system, commercial grade low
e windows and a sophisticated energy monitoring system.  It is built right
next to a conventionally built house, stick framed, minimum residential
code compliant construction with 13 SEER air source heat pumps.  Both are
occupied by single mothers with two children.  The net zero house has worse
energy performance than the code minimum house almost entirely due to
occupant behavior. I personally did not believe you could operate that
house such that it would ever consume much energy, but you can.  In this
case the owner was not determined until after the house was constructed and
did not have a stake in the design and was not trained on the special
features of the house when it was offered to her.  Now that she has been
educated I can see some reductions - but the house is still falling way
short of its goal of net zerobecause the owner is just unwilling to change
her lifestyle no matter what the nergy costs are.

Man, every time I start a reply 3 more have come out, haha!  I think we're all pretty much on the same page though =).  This is largely written in response to Robert's most recent reply:

Applying 10% improvement to lighting/mechanical equipment/envelope is merely a strategy for achieving performance figures in the right ballpark once energy modeling begins.  No more and no less.  I can attest this has worked well for me in the past, but I never meant to imply "..and you're done."

This is just a means of getting the ball rolling and ensuring the important decision makers understand they have a role to play.

I agree completely regarding the limits of SEER and every other standardized efficiency rating I've worked with.  Seasonal and steady state efficiencies are NEVER direct indicators of actual system consumptions, they are merely representations of performance under specific conditions.  That said, they do have a useful time & place which occurs at the beginning of a project, before a more detailed analysis can be made with energy models or otherwise.  SEER may or may not be an inadequate efficiency metric for your specific climate, but that doesn't change what defines your baseline equipment.

If the goal is simply to reduce heating and cooling energy consumptions of your HVAC systems by XX%, and I can't build something resembling the final design for an energy model, I simply can't offer a better answer than "improve your heating and cooling efficiencies by XX%," recognizing this alone will not get you there if your lighting consumptions and envelope performance do not do their part.

A black and white answer to what minimum performance is required of any system for any specific LEED project goal is truly unapproachable until you start the energy model that will determine the results ;).

As it happens however, I can answer Robert's most recent hypothetical almost directly:  I have performed a preliminary study for a building in the vicinity of El Paso, TX using 15 SEER AHU's with energy recovery.  I determined a 30% LEED improvement would have been attainable using an envelope matching 90.1 baseline constructions, but this entailed a roughly 50% LPD reduction (I would have performed the lighting design and can attest this was achievable), and a healthy laundry list of EEM's for mechanical, with a heavy service hot water equipment load helping things along.

So to wrap up, I'd say 15 SEER units absolutely can be one part of a bigger picture achieving a 10% LEED performance rating.

Apologies for the walls of text... sometimes the quick & easy answer is "there aren't any quick and easy answers!"  Hope this discussion is helpful to you and yours in any case!

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] LEED - What does it take?

Robert,
Simple answer is "No" - that is my point - it more than likely never will.  You have to include all of your proposed energy conservation measures that you are likely to apply into a single model with your user and climate/local specific schedules and profiles included to see what the aggregated savings maybe.  You can run multiple models changing only one component to do some sensitivity analysis to see what variables/measures may give you more dramatic changes in total energy consumption, cost, carbon  emissions, indoor comfort, life cycle cost, life cycle assessment, etc.  (which ever your client and you are using as your decision making criteria).
As for the question regarding 10% energy reduction using 15 SEER equipment: I've gotten 10% better energy performance using 90.1 minimum SEER compliant equipment and effecting change in lighting power density, lighting controls, controllable plug loads and better envelope/less infiltration, better ventilation and properly downsizing the mechanical systems.  You do not always have to improve the mechanical efficiency of the HVAC equipment to achieve an energy efficiency improvement target.  It is a whole building analysis that the owner's O&M behavior can have a major impact on.  Conversely, I've had bleeding edge efficiency and complexity in the energy using systems at some facilities and the buildings perform worse than an minimum code compliant building  or a local median EUI when a custodian who knows how to turn things off at night could have done better - when the owner does not understand how the design team intended the building to be operated when they made their analysis.  For example, I just investigated a net zero energy house that was donated to an international non-profit.  It has 22 SEER geothermal heat pumps, an envelope so tight it had no air measurable leakage at 80 pascals, LED lighting, solar water heater, energy recovery ventilator, solar PV, SIPS panel wall system, commercial grade low e windows and a sophisticated energy monitoring system.  It is built right next to a conventionally built house, stick framed, minimum residential code compliant construction with 13 SEER air source heat pumps.  Both are occupied by single mothers with two children.  The net zero house has worse energy performance than the code minimum house almost entirely due to occupant behavior. I personally did not believe you could operate that house such that it would ever consume much energy, but you can.  In this case the owner was not determined until after the house was constructed and did not have a stake in the design and was not trained on the special features of the house when it was offered to her.  Now that she has been educated I can see some reductions - but the house is still falling way short of its goal of net zerobecause the owner is just unwilling to change her lifestyle no matter what the nergy costs are.

I suppose the modeling software and how it treats energy might have something to do with it too (Note to CA and TDV), but for starters the modeling software will look at actual conditions in the particular place where the project is located.

For somewhere with a high cooling demand, SEER should have a greater effect, but cooling is only a small part of the energy budget.

I can appreciate that with "10% better walls, 10% better windows (or how about 10% less windows), 10% lower lighting wattages, 10% more efficient hot water, all compared to the standard, you could get 10% better using a SEER 14.3, but I have never gotten that result.  I suppose that I need to look harder at the other legs on the stool.  For me, I need SEER 17 to get to 10% better in California with a somewhat lopsided stool.  I am curious what experience others have.

The theoretical answer may be "Make everything else use 10% less energy than standard and have a SEER 14.3 AC unit, and you're done" but to be honest, that doesn't ever work for me.

Maybe a better question is; have you ever gotten 10% better than ASHRAE 90.1 with a 15 SEER AC system?  In a real project with real people fighting over costs, etc.?

Building on that analogy, to do 10% better than a LEED baseline, a good starting place is to have at least:
-  10% better lighting (10% lower LPD),
-  10% better HVAC & hot water heating (10% better efficiencies), and
-  10% better envelope (10% more insulation in walls/roof, 10% better windows).
For each of these, you can source the baseline/prescriptive levels from the standard of your choosing.

Overperforming in one area can sometimes make up for underperfomance in another, but with diminishing returns.  Amazing HVAC equipment/design has a harder time shining when you have a poor envelope and/or the lighting designer treats LPD's as a "budget" they have to use up.  For such reasons, it's advisable to always consider building performance in holistic fashion in early/broader discussions.

That's my (simple) take anyway!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Radiance International Workshop 2013
Message-ID: <CD1DD838.18FDF%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>

Greetings simulationists,

A couple months ago I polled these lists for consensus on dates for the
2013 International Radiance Workshop (which we are hosting here at NREL),
and we have settled on August 12-14 (Mon-Wed). The three-day format --
with tutorials on day one and presentations on days two and three -- seems
to have become the standard, so at this time I'd like to get some ideas
from you on what exactly the tutorial content should be.

In the past, the tutorial day has ranged from an HDR imaging workshop
(e.g. 2009-Boston), in-depth dives into new Radiance code additions (e.g.
2011-Berkeley), and in 2003 there were actually *two* tutorial tracks to
pick from: new feature deep dive with Greg Ward, and Radiance 101 with
John Mardaljevic (decisions, decisions!).

Now's our chance to flesh out what this year's tutorial day will look
like. A couple of folks contacted me off-list(s) to inquire about the
possibility of holding an OpenStudio training on that day, particularly
focusing on the use of OpenStudio for Radiance-informed energy analysis.
So, there's one idea. What else ya'll got? DAYSIM show & tell? HDR imaging
again? Feats of strength? Seriously, I'm interested in hearing your ideas
(and your intentions of attending) so we can decide if we're to have one
or more tracks, and what the content will be. So please, lemmeknow. I'll
probably gather up all of your responses and then put it to a vote.

Looking forward to seeing many of you in August!

- Googs

P.S. We will definitely offer tours of our new energy efficient campus
buildings as well. We have a 330,000 ft^2 net zero office building (where
the workshop will be held), super-efficient (and daylit) parking garage
and cafeteria, and, by the time of the workshop, a grid-scale test
facility with the most energy-efficient petascale supercomputer in the
world (PUE <= 1.06). And we have lots of mountains right next door!

Student Travel Awards ? Supporting students to attend BS2013
Nomination deadline: 31 January 2013

Travel to IBPSA Conferences can be an expensive business ? especially for students. In order to assist as many students as possible to participate in BS 2013 in Chambray, France, IBPSA will grant a number of travel awards of up to 1000USD to students presenting papers. The number of places is limited to a maximum of 5 grants and as a result is highly competitive.

The selection committee bases its decisions upon the following selection criteria:

? overall quality of the paper;

? relevance of contribution to the field of and/or furthering the effective application of building simulation;

? need for financial assistance, evidenced in a letter of recommendation from the student?s supervisor/ advisor of studies (must be on university letterhead).

To be eligible, the student must be:

? enrolled in a graduate programme related to building simulation at the time of the conference; AND

? the thesis project must be directly related to building simulation.
Applications MUST be supported by a letter of recommendation from the student?s supervisor/ advisor of studies. Applications for the award must be made by 31 January, 2013 via e-mail to
pieter.dewilde at plymouth.ac.uk. The subject heading of the e-mail should be "Student Travel Award - paper XXX" where XXX is the three-digit reference number for your paper.
The e-mail application must include the following:
The student's name;
The name of the programme, department, faculty, and university;
The title of the PhD or Master's research;
The name of the student's supervisor(s)/ advisor(s);
A scanned version of the faculty recommendation letter on university letterhead in PDF format. (Note that the original letter must be presented to the Conference Secretariat at the conference).

The selection committee will base its decision upon a review of the final manuscripts. Therefore, to be eligible the student MUST submit the paper by the full paper deadline of 31 January, 2013.

Dear All,

I added the weather data that I received from Weather Analytics in the 3rd
row, and the data from White Box Technologies (IWEC2) in the 4th.

Here is the graphs:
https://dl.dropbox.com/u/16228160/Sydney_Weather_Data_Comparision_II.jpg

And here is the graphs with normalized scales for row 3 and row 4:
https://dl.dropbox.com/u/16228160/Sydney_Weather_Data_Comparision_II_Normalized.jpg

The pattern of the radiation rose for both graphs are mostly similar to
IWEC graph, however the wind-rose for Weather Analytics file is slightly
skewed toward north-west. As a conclusion there should be an issue with the
RMY file.

I also did a comparison for average global and direct normal radiation
between the three weather files (IWEC, WeatherAnalytics, IWEC2). Average
global radiation in WeatherAnalytics data is 9.1% more then IWEC2. This
number is 20.7% more for direct normal radiation.
Here are the graphs for monthly and annual comparison:
https://dl.dropbox.com/u/16228160/radiationComparison_Charts.jpg

Unfortunately I don't have the measured data for comparison.

Excel spreadsheet is attached to this email.

Mostapha,

So what was your conclusion about the hourly profile in the solar radiation, which was 
your original question?
I contend that since Sydney is close to the standard meridian for its time zone (150 
degrees east), the solar profile should be symmetrical around noon.

On the total amounts of solar radiation, I have no basis to judge between the three.  Did 
you leave off the RMY for some reason?  Since these are all "typical year" weather files, 
they are likely to be different months from different years. Overall, it does seem that 
the WX is showing more solar than the IWEC or IWEC2, which are quite close.  The larger 
variation in direct normal is understandable, since all the models (as well as 
measurements) show that when total goes down, the fraction direct goes down even more.

The only way to evaluate these weather files is to find some actual measurements, even if 
it's just of monthly or year totals. Otherwise, we can only say that there are differences.

Joe

Dear all,

I am using eQUEST for an energy simulation for LEED. I was wondering  
if from your experience you know if LEED requires custom curves for  
HVAC systems. I saw there are around 15 curves that could be  
customised for a PVVT system. Which performance curves are actually  
required? Thank you in advance.

Kind regards,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] PIU Temperature Schedule in eQuest
Message-ID: <7EDBD70621C6AA448E2778779FDC5BC655B32355@MBX201.domain.local>

All,

Does anybody understand what the zone-level temperature schedule does for a PIU system with parallel-PIU fan control (in eQuest)?

My understanding is that for a PIU system, zone level fans (in a parallel configuration) are only activated during heating hours (is this true?) and draw return air from the plenum to mix with the primary air, thereby taking advantage of the heat in the plenum. It would be counterproductive to do this in cooling mode as the primary air is typically at 55F, much cooler than plenum air.

If my assumption is correct, I am confused by the definition for the Temperature Schedule (called Zone-Fan-T-Sch in the help file), which reads: "Required if Zone: Terminal-Typ = PARALLEL-PIU. Takes the U-name of a schedule (type = temperature) that gives the zone temperature at which the terminal blower turns on. This temperature must be above the heating range."

Why should this temperature be above the heating range? What heating range is this referring to? I would have thought the temperature would be the temperature BELOW which the fans turn on to provide additional heating...in other words, if you're trying to maintain 70F in the space, the fans would be activated at 69F or thereabouts. Does anyone know what this Temperature Schedule does exactly?

Any insight is appreciated.

Chris

My two five cents - adding to the many cents already thrown in the pot.


*         LEED & Appendix G at this point are based on energy cost - not raw BTUs or carbon. So the relative costs of your fuel mix will have an effect on final scores (in a place where electricity is cheap and heating fuel is not - you are likely going to have less credit for your SEER rating). I don't agree with it, but that's how the system is set up.

*         The effectiveness depends on your baseline energy usage. For example - if you have a building that has very small HVAC component, even a 50% reduction won't get you to 10% overall.

*         LEED addresses consumption and not efficiency (which is a good thing). So you get credit for 'driving less'. Hours that you don't need to run your HVAC = money in your pocket (the envelope leg of Nick's tripod analogy).

*         It also depends on other factors like how you deliver the energy. For example - using hydronic cooling & heating will likely save you more energy than an all air system with a higher EER on the chiller. Using a waterside economizer goes back to the 'driving less' analogy. Hydronic systems are also less prone to reheat (simultaneous heating & cooling) issues that you have with all air systems.

The way I like to approach LEED projects is to go after the intent of the credits rather than the point - you'll be surprised at how often you end up with a higher LEED score when you do.

Apologies to Robert if this doesn't directly respond to the original question.

Man, every time I start a reply 3 more have come out, haha!  I think we're all pretty much on the same page though =).  This is largely written in response to Robert's most recent reply:

Applying 10% improvement to lighting/mechanical equipment/envelope is merely a strategy for achieving performance figures in the right ballpark once energy modeling begins.  No more and no less.  I can attest this has worked well for me in the past, but I never meant to imply "..and you're done."

This is just a means of getting the ball rolling and ensuring the important decision makers understand they have a role to play.

I agree completely regarding the limits of SEER and every other standardized efficiency rating I've worked with.  Seasonal and steady state efficiencies are NEVER direct indicators of actual system consumptions, they are merely representations of performance under specific conditions.  That said, they do have a useful time & place which occurs at the beginning of a project, before a more detailed analysis can be made with energy models or otherwise.  SEER may or may not be an inadequate efficiency metric for your specific climate, but that doesn't change what defines your baseline equipment.

If the goal is simply to reduce heating and cooling energy consumptions of your HVAC systems by XX%, and I can't build something resembling the final design for an energy model, I simply can't offer a better answer than "improve your heating and cooling efficiencies by XX%," recognizing this alone will not get you there if your lighting consumptions and envelope performance do not do their part.

A black and white answer to what minimum performance is required of any system for any specific LEED project goal is truly unapproachable until you start the energy model that will determine the results ;).

As it happens however, I can answer Robert's most recent hypothetical almost directly:  I have performed a preliminary study for a building in the vicinity of El Paso, TX using 15 SEER AHU's with energy recovery.  I determined a 30% LEED improvement would have been attainable using an envelope matching 90.1 baseline constructions, but this entailed a roughly 50% LPD reduction (I would have performed the lighting design and can attest this was achievable), and a healthy laundry list of EEM's for mechanical, with a heavy service hot water equipment load helping things along.

So to wrap up, I'd say 15 SEER units absolutely can be one part of a bigger picture achieving a 10% LEED performance rating.

Apologies for the walls of text... sometimes the quick & easy answer is "there aren't any quick and easy answers!"  Hope this discussion is helpful to you and yours in any case!

Robert,
Simple answer is "No" - that is my point - it more than likely never will.  You have to include all of your proposed energy conservation measures that you are likely to apply into a single model with your user and climate/local specific schedules and profiles included to see what the aggregated savings maybe.  You can run multiple models changing only one component to do some sensitivity analysis to see what variables/measures may give you more dramatic changes in total energy consumption, cost, carbon  emissions, indoor comfort, life cycle cost, life cycle assessment, etc.  (which ever your client and you are using as your decision making criteria).
As for the question regarding 10% energy reduction using 15 SEER equipment: I've gotten 10% better energy performance using 90.1 minimum SEER compliant equipment and effecting change in lighting power density, lighting controls, controllable plug loads and better envelope/less infiltration, better ventilation and properly downsizing the mechanical systems.  You do not always have to improve the mechanical efficiency of the HVAC equipment to achieve an energy efficiency improvement target.  It is a whole building analysis that the owner's O&M behavior can have a major impact on.  Conversely, I've had bleeding edge efficiency and complexity in the energy using systems at some facilities and the buildings perform worse than an minimum code compliant building  or a local median EUI when a custodian who knows how to turn things off at night could have done better - when the owner does not understand how the design team intended the building to be operated when they made their analysis.  For example, I just investigated a net zero energy house that was donated to an international non-profit.  It has 22 SEER geothermal heat pumps, an envelope so tight it had no air measurable leakage at 80 pascals, LED lighting, solar water heater, energy recovery ventilator, solar PV, SIPS panel wall system, commercial grade low e windows and a sophisticated energy monitoring system.  It is built right next to a conventionally built house, stick framed, minimum residential code compliant construction with 13 SEER air source heat pumps.  Both are occupied by single mothers with two children.  The net zero house has worse energy performance than the code minimum house almost entirely due to occupant behavior. I personally did not believe you could operate that house such that it would ever consume much energy, but you can.  In this case the owner was not determined until after the house was constructed and did not have a stake in the design and was not trained on the special features of the house when it was offered to her.  Now that she has been educated I can see some reductions - but the house is still falling way short of its goal of net zerobecause the owner is just unwilling to change her lifestyle no matter what the nergy costs are.

For somewhere with a high cooling demand, SEER should have a greater effect, but cooling is only a small part of the energy budget.

I can appreciate that with "10% better walls, 10% better windows (or how about 10% less windows), 10% lower lighting wattages, 10% more efficient hot water, all compared to the standard, you could get 10% better using a SEER 14.3, but I have never gotten that result.  I suppose that I need to look harder at the other legs on the stool.  For me, I need SEER 17 to get to 10% better in California with a somewhat lopsided stool.  I am curious what experience others have.

The theoretical answer may be "Make everything else use 10% less energy than standard and have a SEER 14.3 AC unit, and you're done" but to be honest, that doesn't ever work for me.

Maybe a better question is; have you ever gotten 10% better than ASHRAE 90.1 with a 15 SEER AC system?  In a real project with real people fighting over costs, etc.?

Robert,
SEER is a seasonal energy efficiency ratio and is unitless.  It is the "cooling output during a typical cooling-season divided by the total electric energy input during the same period": http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_energy_efficiency_ratio.  A unit with 10% or better seasonal cooling energy efficiency over a 13 SEER unit would have a SEER rating of 14.3 or greater (1.1x13) if all other operating parameters were held constant.

I absolutely agree with you, Nick, on achieving 10% better, but all the trades point to the others.  It's kind of comical, actually.

I guess my question on this list could be rephrased, using your approach, as "What SEER is 10% better than SEER 13?"

A very simple way of looking at LEED & energy, which I come back to often for discussions on that level, is to consider a building's performance like a tripod with three important legs:  Lights, Mechanical, and Envelope.  If any of those legs is too short, the tripod falls over.

Building on that analogy, to do 10% better than a LEED baseline, a good starting place is to have at least:
-  10% better lighting (10% lower LPD),
-  10% better HVAC & hot water heating (10% better efficiencies), and
-  10% better envelope (10% more insulation in walls/roof, 10% better windows).
For each of these, you can source the baseline/prescriptive levels from the standard of your choosing.

Overperforming in one area can sometimes make up for underperfomance in another, but with diminishing returns.  Amazing HVAC equipment/design has a harder time shining when you have a poor envelope and/or the lighting designer treats LPD's as a "budget" they have to use up.  For such reasons, it's advisable to always consider building performance in holistic fashion in early/broader discussions.

That's my (simple) take anyway!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED - What does it take?

I know that LEED is way more than just energy, and energy is way more than just equipment, but just for a basis, what SEER and EER do people have to use to get 10% better than ASHRAE 90.1 to qualify for LEED?  I also know that you don't have to use ASHRAE 90.1, but that is what I am doing.

So, what does it take?

My shot - Residential Apartment, individual DX units, 17 SEER and 13 EER in California CZ 12 (Mostly cooling).

   Next?

I have been following this discussion, not as an engineer or modeler, but as
someone interested in the factors influencing the financial return on energy
saving products.  My concern is in the same area as Vikram Sami expressed
below but even a little deeper.  Vikram rightly notes that energy costs vary
from location to location so a unit saved one place is not necessarily
comparable to another location.  I would add two other factors that are very
important in an energy efficiency decision - rate structure and time of
energy saving. The bottom line is that an energy unit saved is based on both
the rate structure and the time of day that negative watt was earned.

 

Rate structure factors such as demand response, peak demand, and off hours
rates drive the value of reducing energy usage.  Some utilities offer very
low rates at night.  If you have a building element - such as our Phase
Change Material or Ice Energy's storage process - that can store energy
during the low rate hours; then this energy is available to offset demand
during a peak rate periods.  

 

If a product can reduce the energy usage during a high rate period in a high
rate location then that energy saved should command a higher value in not
only a LEED certifications calculation but in calculating the value in an
energy modeling program for ROI.

 

I am not an expert on energy modeling nor do I know about all the models
available, so this comment needs to be understood from my product
perspective and most likely, my limited knowledge.  It seems to me that most
models are driven by weather data.  Weather data and location drive the
design of the building shell. A building is built to live and work in.
Efficiently managing the internal environment demands managing energy use
for not only the effects from the outside environment but also the comfort
and use of its occupants.  I am excited about the future of building control
systems based on sensors.  This trend will help solve the problems I noted
above but they do more than just save units of energy, they will save energy
at the most expensive moments.  

 

As an MBA - not an engineer - the key here is twofold.  How much energy can
I save with the package of energy saving options available to me and what is
the cost of a unit of energy when I save it.

My two five cents - adding to the many cents already thrown in the pot. 

 

.       LEED & Appendix G at this point are based on energy cost - not raw
BTUs or carbon. So the relative costs of your fuel mix will have an effect
on final scores (in a place where electricity is cheap and heating fuel is
not - you are likely going to have less credit for your SEER rating). I
don't agree with it, but that's how the system is set up.

.       The effectiveness depends on your baseline energy usage. For example
- if you have a building that has very small HVAC component, even a 50%
reduction won't get you to 10% overall. 

.       LEED addresses consumption and not efficiency (which is a good
thing). So you get credit for 'driving less'. Hours that you don't need to
run your HVAC = money in your pocket (the envelope leg of Nick's tripod
analogy). 

.       It also depends on other factors like how you deliver the energy.
For example - using hydronic cooling & heating will likely save you more
energy than an all air system with a higher EER on the chiller. Using a
waterside economizer goes back to the 'driving less' analogy. Hydronic
systems are also less prone to reheat (simultaneous heating & cooling)
issues that you have with all air systems. 

 

The way I like to approach LEED projects is to go after the intent of the
credits rather than the point - you'll be surprised at how often you end up
with a higher LEED score when you do. 

 

Apologies to Robert if this doesn't directly respond to the original
question.

Man, every time I start a reply 3 more have come out, haha!  I think we're
all pretty much on the same page though =).  This is largely written in
response to Robert's most recent reply:

 

Applying 10% improvement to lighting/mechanical equipment/envelope is merely
a strategy for achieving performance figures in the right ballpark once
energy modeling begins.  No more and no less.  I can attest this has worked
well for me in the past, but I never meant to imply "..and you're done."  

 

This is just a means of getting the ball rolling and ensuring the important
decision makers understand they have a role to play.

 

I agree completely regarding the limits of SEER and every other standardized
efficiency rating I've worked with.  Seasonal and steady state efficiencies
are NEVER direct indicators of actual system consumptions, they are merely
representations of performance under specific conditions.  That said, they
do have a useful time & place which occurs at the beginning of a project,
before a more detailed analysis can be made with energy models or otherwise.
SEER may or may not be an inadequate efficiency metric for your specific
climate, but that doesn't change what defines your baseline equipment. 

 

If the goal is simply to reduce heating and cooling energy consumptions of
your HVAC systems by XX%, and I can't build something resembling the final
design for an energy model, I simply can't offer a better answer than
"improve your heating and cooling efficiencies by XX%," recognizing this
alone will not get you there if your lighting consumptions and envelope
performance do not do their part.  

 

A black and white answer to what minimum performance is required of any
system for any specific LEED project goal is truly unapproachable until you
start the energy model that will determine the results ;). 

 

As it happens however, I can answer Robert's most recent hypothetical almost
directly:  I have performed a preliminary study for a building in the
vicinity of El Paso, TX using 15 SEER AHU's with energy recovery.  I
determined a 30% LEED improvement would have been attainable using an
envelope matching 90.1 baseline constructions, but this entailed a roughly
50% LPD reduction (I would have performed the lighting design and can attest
this was achievable), and a healthy laundry list of EEM's for mechanical,
with a heavy service hot water equipment load helping things along.  

 

So to wrap up, I'd say 15 SEER units absolutely can be one part of a bigger
picture achieving a 10% LEED performance rating.

 

Apologies for the walls of text. sometimes the quick & easy answer is "there
aren't any quick and easy answers!"  Hope this discussion is helpful to you
and yours in any case!

Robert,

Simple answer is "No" - that is my point - it more than likely never will.
You have to include all of your proposed energy conservation measures that
you are likely to apply into a single model with your user and climate/local
specific schedules and profiles included to see what the aggregated savings
maybe.  You can run multiple models changing only one component to do some
sensitivity analysis to see what variables/measures may give you more
dramatic changes in total energy consumption, cost, carbon  emissions,
indoor comfort, life cycle cost, life cycle assessment, etc.  (which ever
your client and you are using as your decision making criteria).

As for the question regarding 10% energy reduction using 15 SEER equipment:
I've gotten 10% better energy performance using 90.1 minimum SEER compliant
equipment and effecting change in lighting power density, lighting controls,
controllable plug loads and better envelope/less infiltration, better
ventilation and properly downsizing the mechanical systems.  You do not
always have to improve the mechanical efficiency of the HVAC equipment to
achieve an energy efficiency improvement target.  It is a whole building
analysis that the owner's O&M behavior can have a major impact on.
Conversely, I've had bleeding edge efficiency and complexity in the energy
using systems at some facilities and the buildings perform worse than an
minimum code compliant building  or a local median EUI when a custodian who
knows how to turn things off at night could have done better - when the
owner does not understand how the design team intended the building to be
operated when they made their analysis.  For example, I just investigated a
net zero energy house that was donated to an international non-profit.  It
has 22 SEER geothermal heat pumps, an envelope so tight it had no air
measurable leakage at 80 pascals, LED lighting, solar water heater, energy
recovery ventilator, solar PV, SIPS panel wall system, commercial grade low
e windows and a sophisticated energy monitoring system.  It is built right
next to a conventionally built house, stick framed, minimum residential code
compliant construction with 13 SEER air source heat pumps.  Both are
occupied by single mothers with two children.  The net zero house has worse
energy performance than the code minimum house almost entirely due to
occupant behavior. I personally did not believe you could operate that house
such that it would ever consume much energy, but you can.  In this case the
owner was not determined until after the house was constructed and did not
have a stake in the design and was not trained on the special features of
the house when it was offered to her.  Now that she has been educated I can
see some reductions - but the house is still falling way short of its goal
of net zerobecause the owner is just unwilling to change her lifestyle no
matter what the nergy costs are.

I suppose the modeling software and how it treats energy might have
something to do with it too (Note to CA and TDV), but for starters the
modeling software will look at actual conditions in the particular place
where the project is located.  As an absurd case, if there was no cooling
needed, an infinite SEER would show no improvement.  SEER is for "typical"
and each project is not necessarily typical.  For somewhere with a high
cooling demand, SEER should have a greater effect, but cooling is only a
small part of the energy budget.

I can appreciate that with "10% better walls, 10% better windows (or how
about 10% less windows), 10% lower lighting wattages, 10% more efficient hot
water, all compared to the standard, you could get 10% better using a SEER
14.3, but I have never gotten that result.  I suppose that I need to look
harder at the other legs on the stool.  For me, I need SEER 17 to get to 10%
better in California with a somewhat lopsided stool.  I am curious what
experience others have.

The theoretical answer may be "Make everything else use 10% less energy than
standard and have a SEER 14.3 AC unit, and you're done" but to be honest,
that doesn't ever work for me.

Maybe a better question is; have you ever gotten 10% better than ASHRAE 90.1
with a 15 SEER AC system?  In a real project with real people fighting over
costs, etc.?

Robert, 

SEER is a seasonal energy efficiency ratio and is unitless.  It is the
"cooling output during a typical cooling-season divided by the total
electric energy input during the same period":
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_energy_efficiency_ratio.  A unit with
10% or better seasonal cooling energy efficiency over a 13 SEER unit would
have a SEER rating of 14.3 or greater (1.1x13) if all other operating
parameters were held constant.  See link for definitions and other

I absolutely agree with you, Nick, on achieving 10% better, but all the
trades point to the others.  It's kind of comical, actually.

I guess my question on this list could be rephrased, using your approach, as
"What SEER is 10% better than SEER 13?"

A very simple way of looking at LEED & energy, which I come back to often
for discussions on that level, is to consider a building's performance like
a tripod with three important legs:  Lights, Mechanical, and Envelope.  If
any of those legs is too short, the tripod falls over.

Building on that analogy, to do 10% better than a LEED baseline, a good
starting place is to have at least:
-  10% better lighting (10% lower LPD),
-  10% better HVAC & hot water heating (10% better efficiencies), and
-  10% better envelope (10% more insulation in walls/roof, 10% better
windows).
For each of these, you can source the baseline/prescriptive levels from the
standard of your choosing.

Overperforming in one area can sometimes make up for underperfomance in
another, but with diminishing returns.  Amazing HVAC equipment/design has a
harder time shining when you have a poor envelope and/or the lighting
designer treats LPD's as a "budget" they have to use up.  For such reasons,
it's advisable to always consider building performance in holistic fashion
in early/broader discussions.

That's my (simple) take anyway!

Hear!  Hear!
Joe's comments about how the rate structure affects savings are worth emphasizing.  These are in place by local utilities for a reason - meeting peak demands is often very costly for the utilities and they pass it on to their customers.  I don't recall the details of a talk I heard at ASHRAE's last Energy Modeling Conference, but I'm pretty sure those peak power plants are also less efficient than the base power plants (which may explain part of the reason for higher peak costs).  I've run a couple of energy models with and without the demand charges and have seen big differences in cost.  That, in turn, has led to more diligence in representing the rate structure accurately in my models.
As a side note, a few years back I was not a fan of locally-generated (including renewable) power schemes because their efficiency was uniformly dismal and it seemed that their only reason for viability was federal government subsidies.  As I've become more aware of the base / peak power big picture economics, I am reversing my opinion.  Compared to running a peak power plant, it seems they can be a very viable economic solution even without subsidies.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] LEED - What does it take?

I have been following this discussion, not as an engineer or modeler, but as someone interested in the factors influencing the financial return on energy saving products.  My concern is in the same area as Vikram Sami expressed below but even a little deeper.  Vikram rightly notes that energy costs vary from location to location so a unit saved one place is not necessarily comparable to another location.  I would add two other factors that are very important in an energy efficiency decision - rate structure and time of energy saving. The bottom line is that an energy unit saved is based on both  the rate structure and the time of day that negative watt was earned.

Rate structure factors such as demand response, peak demand, and off hours rates drive the value of reducing energy usage.  Some utilities offer very low rates at night.  If you have a building element - such as our Phase Change Material or Ice Energy's storage process - that can store energy during the low rate hours; then this energy is available to offset demand during a peak rate periods.

If a product can reduce the energy usage during a high rate period in a high rate location then that energy saved should command a higher value in not only a LEED certifications calculation but in calculating the value in an energy modeling program for ROI.

I am not an expert on energy modeling nor do I know about all the models available, so this comment needs to be understood from my product perspective and most likely, my limited knowledge.  It seems to me that most models are driven by weather data.  Weather data and location drive the design of the building shell. A building is built to live and work in.  Efficiently managing the internal environment demands managing energy use for not only the effects from the outside environment but also the comfort and use of its occupants.  I am excited about the future of building control systems based on sensors.  This trend will help solve the problems I noted above but they do more than just save units of energy, they will save energy at the most expensive moments.

As an MBA - not an engineer - the key here is twofold.  How much energy can I save with the package of energy saving options available to me and what is the cost of a unit of energy when I save it.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] LEED - What does it take?

My two five cents - adding to the many cents already thrown in the pot.


*         LEED & Appendix G at this point are based on energy cost - not raw BTUs or carbon. So the relative costs of your fuel mix will have an effect on final scores (in a place where electricity is cheap and heating fuel is not - you are likely going to have less credit for your SEER rating). I don't agree with it, but that's how the system is set up.

*         The effectiveness depends on your baseline energy usage. For example - if you have a building that has very small HVAC component, even a 50% reduction won't get you to 10% overall.

*         LEED addresses consumption and not efficiency (which is a good thing). So you get credit for 'driving less'. Hours that you don't need to run your HVAC = money in your pocket (the envelope leg of Nick's tripod analogy).

*         It also depends on other factors like how you deliver the energy. For example - using hydronic cooling & heating will likely save you more energy than an all air system with a higher EER on the chiller. Using a waterside economizer goes back to the 'driving less' analogy. Hydronic systems are also less prone to reheat (simultaneous heating & cooling) issues that you have with all air systems.

The way I like to approach LEED projects is to go after the intent of the credits rather than the point - you'll be surprised at how often you end up with a higher LEED score when you do.

Apologies to Robert if this doesn't directly respond to the original question.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] LEED - What does it take?

Man, every time I start a reply 3 more have come out, haha!  I think we're all pretty much on the same page though =).  This is largely written in response to Robert's most recent reply:

Applying 10% improvement to lighting/mechanical equipment/envelope is merely a strategy for achieving performance figures in the right ballpark once energy modeling begins.  No more and no less.  I can attest this has worked well for me in the past, but I never meant to imply "..and you're done."

This is just a means of getting the ball rolling and ensuring the important decision makers understand they have a role to play.

I agree completely regarding the limits of SEER and every other standardized efficiency rating I've worked with.  Seasonal and steady state efficiencies are NEVER direct indicators of actual system consumptions, they are merely representations of performance under specific conditions.  That said, they do have a useful time & place which occurs at the beginning of a project, before a more detailed analysis can be made with energy models or otherwise.  SEER may or may not be an inadequate efficiency metric for your specific climate, but that doesn't change what defines your baseline equipment.

If the goal is simply to reduce heating and cooling energy consumptions of your HVAC systems by XX%, and I can't build something resembling the final design for an energy model, I simply can't offer a better answer than "improve your heating and cooling efficiencies by XX%," recognizing this alone will not get you there if your lighting consumptions and envelope performance do not do their part.

A black and white answer to what minimum performance is required of any system for any specific LEED project goal is truly unapproachable until you start the energy model that will determine the results ;).

As it happens however, I can answer Robert's most recent hypothetical almost directly:  I have performed a preliminary study for a building in the vicinity of El Paso, TX using 15 SEER AHU's with energy recovery.  I determined a 30% LEED improvement would have been attainable using an envelope matching 90.1 baseline constructions, but this entailed a roughly 50% LPD reduction (I would have performed the lighting design and can attest this was achievable), and a healthy laundry list of EEM's for mechanical, with a heavy service hot water equipment load helping things along.

So to wrap up, I'd say 15 SEER units absolutely can be one part of a bigger picture achieving a 10% LEED performance rating.

Apologies for the walls of text... sometimes the quick & easy answer is "there aren't any quick and easy answers!"  Hope this discussion is helpful to you and yours in any case!

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] LEED - What does it take?

Robert,
Simple answer is "No" - that is my point - it more than likely never will.  You have to include all of your proposed energy conservation measures that you are likely to apply into a single model with your user and climate/local specific schedules and profiles included to see what the aggregated savings maybe.  You can run multiple models changing only one component to do some sensitivity analysis to see what variables/measures may give you more dramatic changes in total energy consumption, cost, carbon  emissions, indoor comfort, life cycle cost, life cycle assessment, etc.  (which ever your client and you are using as your decision making criteria).
As for the question regarding 10% energy reduction using 15 SEER equipment: I've gotten 10% better energy performance using 90.1 minimum SEER compliant equipment and effecting change in lighting power density, lighting controls, controllable plug loads and better envelope/less infiltration, better ventilation and properly downsizing the mechanical systems.  You do not always have to improve the mechanical efficiency of the HVAC equipment to achieve an energy efficiency improvement target.  It is a whole building analysis that the owner's O&M behavior can have a major impact on.  Conversely, I've had bleeding edge efficiency and complexity in the energy using systems at some facilities and the buildings perform worse than an minimum code compliant building  or a local median EUI when a custodian who knows how to turn things off at night could have done better - when the owner does not understand how the design team intended the building to be operated when they made their analysis.  For example, I just investigated a net zero energy house that was donated to an international non-profit.  It has 22 SEER geothermal heat pumps, an envelope so tight it had no air measurable leakage at 80 pascals, LED lighting, solar water heater, energy recovery ventilator, solar PV, SIPS panel wall system, commercial grade low e windows and a sophisticated energy monitoring system.  It is built right next to a conventionally built house, stick framed, minimum residential code compliant construction with 13 SEER air source heat pumps.  Both are occupied by single mothers with two children.  The net zero house has worse energy performance than the code minimum house almost entirely due to occupant behavior. I personally did not believe you could operate that house such that it would ever consume much energy, but you can.  In this case the owner was not determined until after the house was constructed and did not have a stake in the design and was not trained on the special features of the house when it was offered to her.  Now that she has been educated I can see some reductions - but the house is still falling way short of its goal of net zerobecause the owner is just unwilling to change her lifestyle no matter what the nergy costs are.

I suppose the modeling software and how it treats energy might have something to do with it too (Note to CA and TDV), but for starters the modeling software will look at actual conditions in the particular place where the project is located.  As an absurd case, if there was no cooling needed, an infinite SEER would show no improvement.  SEER is for "typical" and each project is not necessarily typical.  For somewhere with a high cooling demand, SEER should have a greater effect, but cooling is only a small part of the energy budget.

I can appreciate that with "10% better walls, 10% better windows (or how about 10% less windows), 10% lower lighting wattages, 10% more efficient hot water, all compared to the standard, you could get 10% better using a SEER 14.3, but I have never gotten that result.  I suppose that I need to look harder at the other legs on the stool.  For me, I need SEER 17 to get to 10% better in California with a somewhat lopsided stool.  I am curious what experience others have.

The theoretical answer may be "Make everything else use 10% less energy than standard and have a SEER 14.3 AC unit, and you're done" but to be honest, that doesn't ever work for me.

Maybe a better question is; have you ever gotten 10% better than ASHRAE 90.1 with a 15 SEER AC system?  In a real project with real people fighting over costs, etc.?

Robert,
SEER is a seasonal energy efficiency ratio and is unitless.  It is the "cooling output during a typical cooling-season divided by the total electric energy input during the same period": http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_energy_efficiency_ratio.  A unit with 10% or better seasonal cooling energy efficiency over a 13 SEER unit would have a SEER rating of 14.3 or greater (1.1x13) if all other operating parameters were held constant.  See link for definitions and other references.

I absolutely agree with you, Nick, on achieving 10% better, but all the trades point to the others.  It's kind of comical, actually.

I guess my question on this list could be rephrased, using your approach, as "What SEER is 10% better than SEER 13?"

A very simple way of looking at LEED & energy, which I come back to often for discussions on that level, is to consider a building's performance like a tripod with three important legs:  Lights, Mechanical, and Envelope.  If any of those legs is too short, the tripod falls over.

Building on that analogy, to do 10% better than a LEED baseline, a good starting place is to have at least:
-  10% better lighting (10% lower LPD),
-  10% better HVAC & hot water heating (10% better efficiencies), and
-  10% better envelope (10% more insulation in walls/roof, 10% better windows).
For each of these, you can source the baseline/prescriptive levels from the standard of your choosing.

Overperforming in one area can sometimes make up for underperfomance in another, but with diminishing returns.  Amazing HVAC equipment/design has a harder time shining when you have a poor envelope and/or the lighting designer treats LPD's as a "budget" they have to use up.  For such reasons, it's advisable to always consider building performance in holistic fashion in early/broader discussions.

That's my (simple) take anyway!

I know that LEED is way more than just energy, and energy is way more than just equipment, but just for a basis, what SEER and EER do people have to use to get 10% better than ASHRAE 90.1 to qualify for LEED?  I also know that you don't have to use ASHRAE 90.1, but that is what I am doing.

So, what does it take?

My shot - Residential Apartment, individual DX units, 17 SEER and 13 EER in California CZ 12 (Mostly cooling).

   Next?

I agree that the help file language is a bit confusing.  I've always set
this parameter to the same value that is used at the zone level heating
thermostat schedule and never thought twice about it.
 For curiosity's sake, you could likely run an hourly report to determine
that the parallel fan is operating as you think it should.

To solve your problem, I usually just define a user-default expression of
#L("HEAT-TEMP-SCH").  This sets the parallel fan-powered schedule equal to
the zone thermostat schedule automatically.

Dear all, I too have been following this very sensible discussion and now feel the need to throw my comments into the ring. So here goes:
Where are we going with all our simulation and LEED paraphernalia? It would appear that LEED compliance has turned into a numbers game and doesn't require engineering techniques but more like a cross between and MBA and an Attorney (I know what was written, but that isn't the intent of what was written). Basic engineering skills have been replaced by wizardry and unmet hours and most often than not the comparison of a base case to a proposed case are the source of the proposed savings. Why do you think the US is so slow into moving towards performance metrics? Maybe it's because the present way buildings are modeled to comply with LEED have no relationship to how buildings actually perform or more probably the liability of an engineer stating that a certain performance can be achieved based upon a simulation model and the possible shortcomings in a real building.
So what do we do? The easiest way would be to sit back and continue with what is accepted or we could look into the future and decide what import features are most required. This would most probably require a rigorous change to the current standards, but maybe that is what is required?
We are all stuck with applicable utility rates, buildings need lighting and power for equipment, we have people in buildings and architects put glass in buildings and the end result is energy and the cost of energy. Yes, there are many sources of alternative energy, but these have been relatively slow to emerge and are very costly. So if you have immense wealth one could attain a net- zero building or many 'net zero' buildings do not fully utilize lighting and equipment. So why would we require simulation models and compliance documents if we simply choose not to operate building equipment?

Hear!  Hear!
Joe's comments about how the rate structure affects savings are worth emphasizing.  These are in place by local utilities for a reason - meeting peak demands is often very costly for the utilities and they pass it on to their customers.  I don't recall the details of a talk I heard at ASHRAE's last Energy Modeling Conference, but I'm pretty sure those peak power plants are also less efficient than the base power plants (which may explain part of the reason for higher peak costs).  I've run a couple of energy models with and without the demand charges and have seen big differences in cost.  That, in turn, has led to more diligence in representing the rate structure accurately in my models.
As a side note, a few years back I was not a fan of locally-generated (including renewable) power schemes because their efficiency was uniformly dismal and it seemed that their only reason for viability was federal government subsidies.  As I've become more aware of the base / peak power big picture economics, I am reversing my opinion.  Compared to running a peak power plant, it seems they can be a very viable economic solution even without subsidies.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] LEED - What does it take?

I have been following this discussion, not as an engineer or modeler, but as someone interested in the factors influencing the financial return on energy saving products.  My concern is in the same area as Vikram Sami expressed below but even a little deeper.  Vikram rightly notes that energy costs vary from location to location so a unit saved one place is not necessarily comparable to another location.  I would add two other factors that are very important in an energy efficiency decision - rate structure and time of energy saving. The bottom line is that an energy unit saved is based on both  the rate structure and the time of day that negative watt was earned.

Rate structure factors such as demand response, peak demand, and off hours rates drive the value of reducing energy usage.  Some utilities offer very low rates at night.  If you have a building element - such as our Phase Change Material or Ice Energy's storage process - that can store energy during the low rate hours; then this energy is available to offset demand during a peak rate periods.

If a product can reduce the energy usage during a high rate period in a high rate location then that energy saved should command a higher value in not only a LEED certifications calculation but in calculating the value in an energy modeling program for ROI.

I am not an expert on energy modeling nor do I know about all the models available, so this comment needs to be understood from my product perspective and most likely, my limited knowledge.  It seems to me that most models are driven by weather data.  Weather data and location drive the design of the building shell. A building is built to live and work in.  Efficiently managing the internal environment demands managing energy use for not only the effects from the outside environment but also the comfort and use of its occupants.  I am excited about the future of building control systems based on sensors.  This trend will help solve the problems I noted above but they do more than just save units of energy, they will save energy at the most expensive moments.

As an MBA - not an engineer - the key here is twofold.  How much energy can I save with the package of energy saving options available to me and what is the cost of a unit of energy when I save it.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] LEED - What does it take?

My two five cents - adding to the many cents already thrown in the pot.


*         LEED & Appendix G at this point are based on energy cost - not raw BTUs or carbon. So the relative costs of your fuel mix will have an effect on final scores (in a place where electricity is cheap and heating fuel is not - you are likely going to have less credit for your SEER rating). I don't agree with it, but that's how the system is set up.

*         The effectiveness depends on your baseline energy usage. For example - if you have a building that has very small HVAC component, even a 50% reduction won't get you to 10% overall.

*         LEED addresses consumption and not efficiency (which is a good thing). So you get credit for 'driving less'. Hours that you don't need to run your HVAC = money in your pocket (the envelope leg of Nick's tripod analogy).

*         It also depends on other factors like how you deliver the energy. For example - using hydronic cooling & heating will likely save you more energy than an all air system with a higher EER on the chiller. Using a waterside economizer goes back to the 'driving less' analogy. Hydronic systems are also less prone to reheat (simultaneous heating & cooling) issues that you have with all air systems.

The way I like to approach LEED projects is to go after the intent of the credits rather than the point - you'll be surprised at how often you end up with a higher LEED score when you do.

Apologies to Robert if this doesn't directly respond to the original question.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] LEED - What does it take?

Man, every time I start a reply 3 more have come out, haha!  I think we're all pretty much on the same page though =).  This is largely written in response to Robert's most recent reply:

Applying 10% improvement to lighting/mechanical equipment/envelope is merely a strategy for achieving performance figures in the right ballpark once energy modeling begins.  No more and no less.  I can attest this has worked well for me in the past, but I never meant to imply "..and you're done."

This is just a means of getting the ball rolling and ensuring the important decision makers understand they have a role to play.

I agree completely regarding the limits of SEER and every other standardized efficiency rating I've worked with.  Seasonal and steady state efficiencies are NEVER direct indicators of actual system consumptions, they are merely representations of performance under specific conditions.  That said, they do have a useful time & place which occurs at the beginning of a project, before a more detailed analysis can be made with energy models or otherwise.  SEER may or may not be an inadequate efficiency metric for your specific climate, but that doesn't change what defines your baseline equipment.

If the goal is simply to reduce heating and cooling energy consumptions of your HVAC systems by XX%, and I can't build something resembling the final design for an energy model, I simply can't offer a better answer than "improve your heating and cooling efficiencies by XX%," recognizing this alone will not get you there if your lighting consumptions and envelope performance do not do their part.

A black and white answer to what minimum performance is required of any system for any specific LEED project goal is truly unapproachable until you start the energy model that will determine the results ;).

As it happens however, I can answer Robert's most recent hypothetical almost directly:  I have performed a preliminary study for a building in the vicinity of El Paso, TX using 15 SEER AHU's with energy recovery.  I determined a 30% LEED improvement would have been attainable using an envelope matching 90.1 baseline constructions, but this entailed a roughly 50% LPD reduction (I would have performed the lighting design and can attest this was achievable), and a healthy laundry list of EEM's for mechanical, with a heavy service hot water equipment load helping things along.

So to wrap up, I'd say 15 SEER units absolutely can be one part of a bigger picture achieving a 10% LEED performance rating.

Apologies for the walls of text... sometimes the quick & easy answer is "there aren't any quick and easy answers!"  Hope this discussion is helpful to you and yours in any case!

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] LEED - What does it take?

Robert,
Simple answer is "No" - that is my point - it more than likely never will.  You have to include all of your proposed energy conservation measures that you are likely to apply into a single model with your user and climate/local specific schedules and profiles included to see what the aggregated savings maybe.  You can run multiple models changing only one component to do some sensitivity analysis to see what variables/measures may give you more dramatic changes in total energy consumption, cost, carbon  emissions, indoor comfort, life cycle cost, life cycle assessment, etc.  (which ever your client and you are using as your decision making criteria).
As for the question regarding 10% energy reduction using 15 SEER equipment: I've gotten 10% better energy performance using 90.1 minimum SEER compliant equipment and effecting change in lighting power density, lighting controls, controllable plug loads and better envelope/less infiltration, better ventilation and properly downsizing the mechanical systems.  You do not always have to improve the mechanical efficiency of the HVAC equipment to achieve an energy efficiency improvement target.  It is a whole building analysis that the owner's O&M behavior can have a major impact on.  Conversely, I've had bleeding edge efficiency and complexity in the energy using systems at some facilities and the buildings perform worse than an minimum code compliant building  or a local median EUI when a custodian who knows how to turn things off at night could have done better - when the owner does not understand how the design team intended the building to be operated when they made their analysis.  For example, I just investigated a net zero energy house that was donated to an international non-profit.  It has 22 SEER geothermal heat pumps, an envelope so tight it had no air measurable leakage at 80 pascals, LED lighting, solar water heater, energy recovery ventilator, solar PV, SIPS panel wall system, commercial grade low e windows and a sophisticated energy monitoring system.  It is built right next to a conventionally built house, stick framed, minimum residential code compliant construction with 13 SEER air source heat pumps.  Both are occupied by single mothers with two children.  The net zero house has worse energy performance than the code minimum house almost entirely due to occupant behavior. I personally did not believe you could operate that house such that it would ever consume much energy, but you can.  In this case the owner was not determined until after the house was constructed and did not have a stake in the design and was not trained on the special features of the house when it was offered to her.  Now that she has been educated I can see some reductions - but the house is still falling way short of its goal of net zerobecause the owner is just unwilling to change her lifestyle no matter what the nergy costs are.

I suppose the modeling software and how it treats energy might have something to do with it too (Note to CA and TDV), but for starters the modeling software will look at actual conditions in the particular place where the project is located.  As an absurd case, if there was no cooling needed, an infinite SEER would show no improvement.  SEER is for "typical" and each project is not necessarily typical.  For somewhere with a high cooling demand, SEER should have a greater effect, but cooling is only a small part of the energy budget.

I can appreciate that with "10% better walls, 10% better windows (or how about 10% less windows), 10% lower lighting wattages, 10% more efficient hot water, all compared to the standard, you could get 10% better using a SEER 14.3, but I have never gotten that result.  I suppose that I need to look harder at the other legs on the stool.  For me, I need SEER 17 to get to 10% better in California with a somewhat lopsided stool.  I am curious what experience others have.

The theoretical answer may be "Make everything else use 10% less energy than standard and have a SEER 14.3 AC unit, and you're done" but to be honest, that doesn't ever work for me.

Maybe a better question is; have you ever gotten 10% better than ASHRAE 90.1 with a 15 SEER AC system?  In a real project with real people fighting over costs, etc.?

Robert,
SEER is a seasonal energy efficiency ratio and is unitless.  It is the "cooling output during a typical cooling-season divided by the total electric energy input during the same period": http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_energy_efficiency_ratio.  A unit with 10% or better seasonal cooling energy efficiency over a 13 SEER unit would have a SEER rating of 14.3 or greater (1.1x13) if all other operating parameters were held constant.  See link for definitions and other references.

I absolutely agree with you, Nick, on achieving 10% better, but all the trades point to the others.  It's kind of comical, actually.

I guess my question on this list could be rephrased, using your approach, as "What SEER is 10% better than SEER 13?"

A very simple way of looking at LEED & energy, which I come back to often for discussions on that level, is to consider a building's performance like a tripod with three important legs:  Lights, Mechanical, and Envelope.  If any of those legs is too short, the tripod falls over.

Building on that analogy, to do 10% better than a LEED baseline, a good starting place is to have at least:
-  10% better lighting (10% lower LPD),
-  10% better HVAC & hot water heating (10% better efficiencies), and
-  10% better envelope (10% more insulation in walls/roof, 10% better windows).
For each of these, you can source the baseline/prescriptive levels from the standard of your choosing.

Overperforming in one area can sometimes make up for underperfomance in another, but with diminishing returns.  Amazing HVAC equipment/design has a harder time shining when you have a poor envelope and/or the lighting designer treats LPD's as a "budget" they have to use up.  For such reasons, it's advisable to always consider building performance in holistic fashion in early/broader discussions.

That's my (simple) take anyway!

I know that LEED is way more than just energy, and energy is way more than just equipment, but just for a basis, what SEER and EER do people have to use to get 10% better than ASHRAE 90.1 to qualify for LEED?  I also know that you don't have to use ASHRAE 90.1, but that is what I am doing.

So, what does it take?

Great Conversation All,
I'd like to jump back in with a few more thoughts (having to jot them down
quickly - so apologize if not well organized):
First, I believe our energy codes will soon have to go to performance based
criteria if we are going to meet the "net zero energy building" goals
ASHRAE and other organizations have agreed to hit by 2030 for new
construction and major renovations.  I think ASHRAE is possibly on to
something with the bEQ rating which is a rating based on a net zero target
and will help drive us toward performance based codes.  Since the bEQ has
both an "as-designed" component and an "as-operated" component user/owner
behavior will have a large impact on the final outcome - which I believe
will be positive - since an owner will be incented to meet the energy
targets they established in the design phase in order to keep the rating
and, hopefully, keep the value of the property up based on its performance.
 It could be a market based, engineering based way to get us to net zero
energy buildings by allowing us to be creative and innovative.  I'd rather
be given a wish list of things the market wants (including a mandatory
energy target) and a fixed budget and let me be as creative as possible at
providing as many things off the wish list as is possible than be given a
wish list in the form of contract documents then receive bids (variable
cost due to bidders) and have to go through the dreaded value engineering
process where line items from the list are often eliminated without any
economic consideration to the long term effects on the building or its
energy consumption.

The marginal cost for a utility to deliver an additional kWh of capacity
that it does not have/own the generation infrastructure to make that kWh is
almost always more expensive than delivering that kWh from existing
generation capacity whether they purchase it from another company off the
grid or have to build more peaking capacity using something like a gas
turbine.  I'm not sure I totally agree with Vikram on his note about LEED
being based on consumption instead of cost: Appendix G and LEED are focused
on one year's cost rather consumption rather than an efficiency standard
something like a kBtu/sf metric (although they are beginning to track such
numbers in EPA's Portfolio Manager).  That's also why thermal storage can
be used to reduce the annual cost of energy consumption at a building and
actually increase consumption by shifting load to the off peak times of the
local utility to use the utility's base line generation capacity and that
is why demand side management programs and incentives by utilities are so
popular.

A global well connected eGrid could fix a lot of this by allowing excess
baseline generation  capacity at night in the US to say - offset peak load
during the day in the far east (12 hour time difference) and vice versa
(can you imagine the politics and trade policies that would have to be in
place to let that happen?). We would need a good many fewer power plants in
general under this scenario.

Sorry I do not have more time to add more details right now - got to run -
hope the additional comments will generate more discussion.
Thanks,
Dennis

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Reminder: RMESE Meeting January 22
Message-ID: <CAN1ZnDtL3uqKJcEpVG0p9aiyV-kwimiFUmR4wf9sYk6iD98b5g@mail.gmail.com>

Join us *Tuesday, January 22* for the next meeting of the Rocky Mountain
Energy Simulation Engineers (RMESE). Chris Baker will be presenting on
"Minding the Gap".

Register here: http://rockymtnashrae.com/meetinginfo.php?id=33&ts=1355412456

*"Minding the Gap"*

The use of energy modeling to drive design decisions earlier in the design
process has long been recognized as an effective way to increase building
energy performance. With this in mind, several utility-sponsored Design
Assistance programs in the Midwest and Colorado regions expanded their
scope to provide comparative energy analysis of design options as early as
the building programming portion of the design process. These utility
programs attempt to influence decisions that significantly impact the
energy performance of the designed building. To be effective for market
transformation, these programs need to provide incentives for more
energy-efficient decisions that occur in the conceptual stages of design.
To calculate savings in a utility program and provide incentives that can
be defensible, a fair and consistent baseline protocol is needed. Appendix
G to ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-2007 is currently the most robust energy
modeling protocol that can be used by such incentive programs and rating
systems. However, this protocol does not provide adequate baseline criteria
to evaluate early design decisions, such as building shape, glazing and
skylight area and programmatic efficiency. To enable the calculation of
savings and incentives, Appendix G needs to be expanded to provide
additional baseline criteria.

This presentation explores where Appendix G falls short of providing
baseline criteria for decisions made early in the design process, and
proposes changes to Appendix G that would allow these savings to be
captured.
 Chris Baker, AIA, PE, BEMP, BEAP, LEED? AP BD+C

Chris Baker, an Energy Analyst at The Weidt Group, focuses on providing
data and analysis to help design teams understand the energy and
environmental implications of various design options. Since joining The
Weidt Group in 2006, Mr. Baker has consulted on projects totaling more than
5 million square feet, including fifteen LEED Certified projects and
another 17 LEED Registered projects.

Mr. Baker received an MBA from the University of Minnesota and a Bachelor
of Architecture and Bachelor of Science in Architectural Engineering with
an HVAC emphasis from the University of Kansas. He is a Registered
Architect and Professional Engineer.

We will be meeting at *The RMH Group in Lakewood at 6:00 pm on Tuesday,
January 22* for a short presentation, appetizers, and drinks. The RMH Group
is located roughly 1 mile east of NREL at:



The RMH Group, Inc.

12600 W Colfax Avenue

Suite A-260

Lakewood, CO 80215
We are not yet able to offer our presentations as an on-line webinar or
streaming video.  We are looking into it for the future but we're still
just getting RMESE off the ground so it's probably something we will grow
into later.

Hi Joe,

For or purpose of designing the mass of the building at the early
conceptual stage of the design, we are more concerned with the relative
magnitudes of solar radiation. This is not to say that we are entirely not
concerned with the solar radiation values, but that is less of an
importance at this stage.

Since the RMY file shows a skewed radiation-rose different from all the
other files we decided not to use that file for the studies. I also agree
with your point about the location of Sydney. I double checked and it is
near the center of UTC+10: (http://www.timeanddate.com/time/map/)

Regards,
Mostapha

Message-ID: <CAAkkLHG2PgH-BCrktcGGTvCjwqctyP5a6R=7-0WXopTAqfne4A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

I am in the process of modelling some WSHPs in EE4 which have been rated
using AHRI/ISO 13256-1 standard. Can someone point me to a reference which
explains how to determine the fan power for these units as required by the
EE4 Modelling Guide?

NFRC ratings and the Window software historically use composite boundary conditions (convective and LW radiative).  I think they have them split now in the latest version of Window 6/7 though one would have to check the manuals etc.

Historically, an internal film coefficient of hi=8.3 W/m2 oK (sorry but I am Canadian, Australian) or so was assumed which when you do the back of the envelope is about half convective and half LW radiative.  So a lowE coat on the inner facing surface of a window (has to be exposed to air/gas to improve U-Value) would lower the radiative heat transfer coefficient leaving you with 4 or so for convection.  

Its the first time I have seen a lowE coating on a film that can be exposed to atmosphere.  I could be wrong but the Southwall XIR films use spectrally selective coatings or filters within the film raher than on the surface of the film.  We are used to seeing it on glass as a hard or pyrolytic coat on Pilkington k-glass - I am sitting next to a piece in our home study that definitely lowers the U-Value with no air gap ? .  The truly spectrally selective coatings are soft and prone to oxidation if exposed to atmosphere thus why we see them in sealed air cavities.

So if Enerlogic have managed to coat a film that can be retrofitted onto a piece of glass then they have something.  I would be checking what warranty there is on the performance as it could be prone to oxidation or have UV stability issues (a historic problem with older generation retrofit films).

Regards,
Graham

A quick and, but not definitive response.  There are known problems with the RMY files for Australian which I believe are left unresolved at this time as the government ran out of funding to correct the problems.  And yet we have them ratcheting up the energy provisions within our construction code and expecting sensible if not deliverable results from JV3 simulations (the equivalent of a 90.1 energy cost budget simulation)!

So today we still use Test Reference Year (TRY) Files that can be bought from ACADS-BSG in raw data form.  The BIN files on DOE-2.COM are built off of these TRYs.

Aside from that the radiation data itself is unsymmetric in Sydney.  I have not done a definitive analysis but we tend to see clearer mornings in the weather file leading to higher DNI and higher overall global horizontal in the morning half of the hemisphere than the afternoon half.  Over the course of the day our intense sun (10% more radiation or so in a southern hemisphere summer due to the elliptical orbit we have around the sun) leads to evaporation and cloud building up that lowers both DNI and global horizontal with all else equal.  I thought it was a weather file problem years ago but satisfied myself it wasn't in the end.  This wouldn't explain observing the sun rising earlier or later relative to the sunset if you are otherwise in the middle of the time zone...  

Sorry I can't provide more background on the Aussie RMY's but I need to get off to work.

Weighing in from the ?outside?, I agree very much with Joe on the future of building control systems being based on sensors but I believe sensors augmented with precision, highly localized weather data - forecasts which will drive predictive control, and current and recent condition data for sensor verification and external variables not being measured.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] LEED - What does it take?

I have been following this discussion, not as an engineer or modeler, but as someone interested in the factors influencing the financial return on energy saving products.  My concern is in the same area as Vikram Sami expressed below but even a little deeper.  Vikram rightly notes that energy costs vary from location to location so a unit saved one place is not necessarily comparable to another location.  I would add two other factors that are very important in an energy efficiency decision - rate structure and time of energy saving. The bottom line is that an energy unit saved is based on both  the rate structure and the time of day that negative watt was earned.

 

Rate structure factors such as demand response, peak demand, and off hours rates drive the value of reducing energy usage.  Some utilities offer very low rates at night.  If you have a building element - such as our Phase Change Material or Ice Energy's storage process - that can store energy during the low rate hours; then this energy is available to offset demand during a peak rate periods.  

 

If a product can reduce the energy usage during a high rate period in a high rate location then that energy saved should command a higher value in not only a LEED certifications calculation but in calculating the value in an energy modeling program for ROI.

 

I am not an expert on energy modeling nor do I know about all the models available, so this comment needs to be understood from my product perspective and most likely, my limited knowledge.  It seems to me that most models are driven by weather data.  Weather data and location drive the design of the building shell. A building is built to live and work in.  Efficiently managing the internal environment demands managing energy use for not only the effects from the outside environment but also the comfort and use of its occupants.  I am excited about the future of building control systems based on sensors.  This trend will help solve the problems I noted above but they do more than just save units of energy, they will save energy at the most expensive moments.  

 

As an MBA - not an engineer - the key here is twofold.  How much energy can I save with the package of energy saving options available to me and what is the cost of a unit of energy when I save it.

My two five cents ? adding to the many cents already thrown in the pot. 

 

?       LEED & Appendix G at this point are based on energy cost ? not raw BTUs or carbon. So the relative costs of your fuel mix will have an effect on final scores (in a place where electricity is cheap and heating fuel is not ? you are likely going to have less credit for your SEER rating). I don?t agree with it, but that?s how the system is set up.

?       The effectiveness depends on your baseline energy usage. For example ? if you have a building that has very small HVAC component, even a 50% reduction won?t get you to 10% overall. 

?       LEED addresses consumption and not efficiency (which is a good thing). So you get credit for ?driving less?. Hours that you don?t need to run your HVAC = money in your pocket (the envelope leg of Nick?s tripod analogy). 

?       It also depends on other factors like how you deliver the energy. For example ? using hydronic cooling & heating will likely save you more energy than an all air system with a higher EER on the chiller. Using a waterside economizer goes back to the ?driving less? analogy. Hydronic systems are also less prone to reheat (simultaneous heating & cooling) issues that you have with all air systems. 

 

The way I like to approach LEED projects is to go after the intent of the credits rather than the point ? you?ll be surprised at how often you end up with a higher LEED score when you do. 

 

Apologies to Robert if this doesn?t directly respond to the original question.

Man, every time I start a reply 3 more have come out, haha!  I think we?re all pretty much on the same page though =).  This is largely written in response to Robert?s most recent reply:

 

Applying 10% improvement to lighting/mechanical equipment/envelope is merely a strategy for achieving performance figures in the right ballpark once energy modeling begins.  No more and no less.  I can attest this has worked well for me in the past, but I never meant to imply ?..and you?re done.?  

 

This is just a means of getting the ball rolling and ensuring the important decision makers understand they have a role to play.

 

I agree completely regarding the limits of SEER and every other standardized efficiency rating I?ve worked with.  Seasonal and steady state efficiencies are NEVER direct indicators of actual system consumptions, they are merely representations of performance under specific conditions.  That said, they do have a useful time & place which occurs at the beginning of a project, before a more detailed analysis can be made with energy models or otherwise.  SEER may or may not be an inadequate efficiency metric for your specific climate, but that doesn?t change what defines your baseline equipment. 

 

If the goal is simply to reduce heating and cooling energy consumptions of your HVAC systems by XX%, and I can?t build something resembling the final design for an energy model, I simply can?t offer a better answer than ?improve your heating and cooling efficiencies by XX%,? recognizing this alone will not get you there if your lighting consumptions and envelope performance do not do their part.  

 

A black and white answer to what minimum performance is required of any system for any specific LEED project goal is truly unapproachable until you start the energy model that will determine the results ;). 

 

As it happens however, I can answer Robert?s most recent hypothetical almost directly:  I have performed a preliminary study for a building in the vicinity of El Paso, TX using 15 SEER AHU?s with energy recovery.  I determined a 30% LEED improvement would have been attainable using an envelope matching 90.1 baseline constructions, but this entailed a roughly 50% LPD reduction (I would have performed the lighting design and can attest this was achievable), and a healthy laundry list of EEM?s for mechanical, with a heavy service hot water equipment load helping things along.  

 

So to wrap up, I?d say 15 SEER units absolutely can be one part of a bigger picture achieving a 10% LEED performance rating.

 

Apologies for the walls of text? sometimes the quick & easy answer is ?there aren?t any quick and easy answers!?  Hope this discussion is helpful to you and yours in any case!

Robert,

Simple answer is "No" - that is my point - it more than likely never will.  You have to include all of your proposed energy conservation measures that you are likely to apply into a single model with your user and climate/local specific schedules and profiles included to see what the aggregated savings maybe.  You can run multiple models changing only one component to do some sensitivity analysis to see what variables/measures may give you more dramatic changes in total energy consumption, cost, carbon  emissions, indoor comfort, life cycle cost, life cycle assessment, etc.  (which ever your client and you are using as your decision making criteria).

As for the question regarding 10% energy reduction using 15 SEER equipment: I've gotten 10% better energy performance using 90.1 minimum SEER compliant equipment and effecting change in lighting power density, lighting controls, controllable plug loads and better envelope/less infiltration, better ventilation and properly downsizing the mechanical systems.  You do not always have to improve the mechanical efficiency of the HVAC equipment to achieve an energy efficiency improvement target.  It is a whole building analysis that the owner's O&M behavior can have a major impact on.  Conversely, I've had bleeding edge efficiency and complexity in the energy using systems at some facilities and the buildings perform worse than an minimum code compliant building  or a local median EUI when a custodian who knows how to turn things off at night could have done better - when the owner does not understand how the design team intended the building to be operated when they made their analysis.  For example, I just investigated a net zero energy house that was donated to an international non-profit.  It has 22 SEER geothermal heat pumps, an envelope so tight it had no air measurable leakage at 80 pascals, LED lighting, solar water heater, energy recovery ventilator, solar PV, SIPS panel wall system, commercial grade low e windows and a sophisticated energy monitoring system.  It is built right next to a conventionally built house, stick framed, minimum residential code compliant construction with 13 SEER air source heat pumps.  Both are occupied by single mothers with two children.  The net zero house has worse energy performance than the code minimum house almost entirely due to occupant behavior. I personally did not believe you could operate that house such that it would ever consume much energy, but you can.  In this case the owner was not determined until after the house was constructed and did not have a stake in the design and was not trained on the special features of the house when it was offered to her.  Now that she has been educated I can see some reductions - but the house is still falling way short of its goal of net zerobecause the owner is just unwilling to change her lifestyle no matter what the nergy costs are.

I suppose the modeling software and how it treats energy might have something to do with it too (Note to CA and TDV), but for starters the modeling software will look at actual conditions in the particular place where the project is located.  As an absurd case, if there was no cooling needed, an infinite SEER would show no improvement.  SEER is for "typical" and each project is not necessarily typical.  For somewhere with a high cooling demand, SEER should have a greater effect, but cooling is only a small part of the energy budget.

I can appreciate that with "10% better walls, 10% better windows (or how about 10% less windows), 10% lower lighting wattages, 10% more efficient hot water, all compared to the standard, you could get 10% better using a SEER 14.3, but I have never gotten that result.  I suppose that I need to look harder at the other legs on the stool.  For me, I need SEER 17 to get to 10% better in California with a somewhat lopsided stool.  I am curious what experience others have.

The theoretical answer may be "Make everything else use 10% less energy than standard and have a SEER 14.3 AC unit, and you're done" but to be honest, that doesn't ever work for me.

Maybe a better question is; have you ever gotten 10% better than ASHRAE 90.1 with a 15 SEER AC system?  In a real project with real people fighting over costs, etc.?

  Robert, 

  SEER is a seasonal energy efficiency ratio and is unitless.  It is the "cooling output during a typical cooling-season divided by the total electric energy input during the same period": http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_energy_efficiency_ratio.  A unit with 10% or better seasonal cooling energy efficiency over a 13 SEER unit would have a SEER rating of 14.3 or greater (1.1x13) if all other operating parameters were held constant.  See link for definitions and other references.

  I absolutely agree with you, Nick, on achieving 10% better, but all the trades point to the others.  It's kind of comical, actually.

  I guess my question on this list could be rephrased, using your approach, as "What SEER is 10% better than SEER 13?"

  A very simple way of looking at LEED & energy, which I come back to often for discussions on that level, is to consider a building's performance like a tripod with three important legs:  Lights, Mechanical, and Envelope.  If any of those legs is too short, the tripod falls over.

  Building on that analogy, to do 10% better than a LEED baseline, a good starting place is to have at least:
  -  10% better lighting (10% lower LPD),
  -  10% better HVAC & hot water heating (10% better efficiencies), and
  -  10% better envelope (10% more insulation in walls/roof, 10% better windows).
  For each of these, you can source the baseline/prescriptive levels from the standard of your choosing.

  Overperforming in one area can sometimes make up for underperfomance in another, but with diminishing returns.  Amazing HVAC equipment/design has a harder time shining when you have a poor envelope and/or the lighting designer treats LPD's as a "budget" they have to use up.  For such reasons, it's advisable to always consider building performance in holistic fashion in early/broader discussions.

  That's my (simple) take anyway!

  I know that LEED is way more than just energy, and energy is way more than just equipment, but just for a basis, what SEER and EER do people have to use to get 10% better than ASHRAE 90.1 to qualify for LEED?  I also know that you don't have to use ASHRAE 90.1, but that is what I am doing.

  So, what does it take?

  My shot - Residential Apartment, individual DX units, 17 SEER and 13 EER in California CZ 12 (Mostly cooling).

     Next?

Graham,

Thanks for the information.  I downloaded the ACADS-BSG weather file and also ran some 
statistics on it.
I also went on the web and within a few minutes found several sources for solar radiation 
in Sydney, which seems
to average between 16-17 megajoules /m2  or 4444-4722 Watts/m2 per day.  If anyone wants 
to devote a few
hours to this, I'm sure one can get quite a good sense of the measured solar radiation in 
Sydney.

I also recalculated the totals from ACADS, IWEC, and IWEC2, and think that Mostapha made a 
mistake on  the
IWEC2 total horizontal,  because what I got was 4519 rather than the 4180 reported by 
Mostapha :

                                                                                ACADS   
IWEC   IWEC2    WX (as calculated by Mostapha)
                                                                                       
(all in W/m2 per day)
                                         Total Horizontal            4386     4526      
4519    4940
                                          DIrect Normal               4442    3979      
3628    4802

Based on what I've seen so far, I would say that the IWEC and IWEC2 solar are in the 
middle of the measured data, the ACADS is somewhat  low, and the WX seems somewhat high.

My fault.  When I recalculated the IWEC2 solar using awk, I got the same numbers as 
Mostapha, rather than the higher number I got using Excel.  So now, it would seem that 
IWEC is right in the middle, ACADS and IWEC2 are low,  and WX is high.

Thank you Joe and Graham for the information.

I'm curious to know where I made the mistake though. Isn't the number equal
to the average of the column L (total diffuse radiation) * 24 hours = 174.15
* 24 hours = 4179.6? Probably I'm missing something here.

Thanks,
Mostapha

Classification: UNCLASSIFIED
Caveats: NONE

Energy Cost Comment-
Working for the Army, we have many similar buildings in many different locations. We once had 2 buildings each in the same climate type, designed the same, but they differed by 5 leed points when it came to energy savings.  When we look into why, it turned out the only difference was utility rates.  

Weather Comment-
What I have seem with a few high performance buildings is that the weather is becoming a very small factor.

Primary office building with a lot of computer equipment, well insulated roof and walls with energy recovery for outside air and a low outside wall to square footage ratio (large cubes.)

Controls Comment-
I also think that controls are one of the most crucial keys to energy savings.  I have toured too many buildings when they were not occupied and the outside air dampers were 100% open.  I don't have a site, but I remember one article that said most buildings could save 30% in energy just by changing how it is controlled.  Less efficient equipment turned off is always more efficient that highly efficient equipment running when it doesn't need to.

Weighing in from the ?outside?, I agree very much with Joe on the future of building control systems being based on sensors but I believe sensors augmented with precision, highly localized weather data - forecasts which will drive predictive control, and current and recent condition data for sensor verification and external variables not being measured.

I have been following this discussion, not as an engineer or modeler, but as someone interested in the factors influencing the financial return on energy saving products.  My concern is in the same area as Vikram Sami expressed below but even a little deeper.  Vikram rightly notes that energy costs vary from location to location so a unit saved one place is not necessarily comparable to another location.  I would add two other factors that are very important in an energy efficiency decision - rate structure and time of energy saving. The bottom line is that an energy unit saved is based on both  the rate structure and the time of day that negative watt was earned.

 

Rate structure factors such as demand response, peak demand, and off hours rates drive the value of reducing energy usage.  Some utilities offer very low rates at night.  If you have a building element - such as our Phase Change Material or Ice Energy's storage process - that can store energy during the low rate hours; then this energy is available to offset demand during a peak rate periods.  

 

If a product can reduce the energy usage during a high rate period in a high rate location then that energy saved should command a higher value in not only a LEED certifications calculation but in calculating the value in an energy modeling program for ROI.

 

I am not an expert on energy modeling nor do I know about all the models available, so this comment needs to be understood from my product perspective and most likely, my limited knowledge.  It seems to me that most models are driven by weather data.  Weather data and location drive the design of the building shell. A building is built to live and work in.  Efficiently managing the internal environment demands managing energy use for not only the effects from the outside environment but also the comfort and use of its occupants.  I am excited about the future of building control systems based on sensors.  This trend will help solve the problems I noted above but they do more than just save units of energy, they will save energy at the most expensive moments.  

 

As an MBA - not an engineer - the key here is twofold.  How much energy can I save with the package of energy saving options available to me and what is the cost of a unit of energy when I save it.

My two five cents ? adding to the many cents already thrown in the pot. 

 

?       LEED & Appendix G at this point are based on energy cost ? not raw BTUs or carbon. So the relative costs of your fuel mix will have an effect on final scores (in a place where electricity is cheap and heating fuel is not ? you are likely going to have less credit for your SEER rating). I don?t agree with it, but that?s how the system is set up.

?       The effectiveness depends on your baseline energy usage. For example ? if you have a building that has very small HVAC component, even a 50% reduction won?t get you to 10% overall. 

?       LEED addresses consumption and not efficiency (which is a good thing). So you get credit for ?driving less?. Hours that you don?t need to run your HVAC = money in your pocket (the envelope leg of Nick?s tripod analogy). 

?       It also depends on other factors like how you deliver the energy. For example ? using hydronic cooling & heating will likely save you more energy than an all air system with a higher EER on the chiller. Using a waterside economizer goes back to the ?driving less? analogy. Hydronic systems are also less prone to reheat (simultaneous heating & cooling) issues that you have with all air systems. 

 

The way I like to approach LEED projects is to go after the intent of the credits rather than the point ? you?ll be surprised at how often you end up with a higher LEED score when you do. 

 

Apologies to Robert if this doesn?t directly respond to the original question.

Man, every time I start a reply 3 more have come out, haha!  I think we?re all pretty much on the same page though =).  This is largely written in response to Robert?s most recent reply:

 

Applying 10% improvement to lighting/mechanical equipment/envelope is merely a strategy for achieving performance figures in the right ballpark once energy modeling begins.  No more and no less.  I can attest this has worked well for me in the past, but I never meant to imply ?..and you?re done.?  

 

This is just a means of getting the ball rolling and ensuring the important decision makers understand they have a role to play.

 

I agree completely regarding the limits of SEER and every other standardized efficiency rating I?ve worked with.  Seasonal and steady state efficiencies are NEVER direct indicators of actual system consumptions, they are merely representations of performance under specific conditions.  That said, they do have a useful time & place which occurs at the beginning of a project, before a more detailed analysis can be made with energy models or otherwise.  SEER may or may not be an inadequate efficiency metric for your specific climate, but that doesn?t change what defines your baseline equipment. 

 

If the goal is simply to reduce heating and cooling energy consumptions of your HVAC systems by XX%, and I can?t build something resembling the final design for an energy model, I simply can?t offer a better answer than ?improve your heating and cooling efficiencies by XX%,? recognizing this alone will not get you there if your lighting consumptions and envelope performance do not do their part.  

 

A black and white answer to what minimum performance is required of any system for any specific LEED project goal is truly unapproachable until you start the energy model that will determine the results ;). 

 

As it happens however, I can answer Robert?s most recent hypothetical almost directly:  I have performed a preliminary study for a building in the vicinity of El Paso, TX using 15 SEER AHU?s with energy recovery.  I determined a 30% LEED improvement would have been attainable using an envelope matching 90.1 baseline constructions, but this entailed a roughly 50% LPD reduction (I would have performed the lighting design and can attest this was achievable), and a healthy laundry list of EEM?s for mechanical, with a heavy service hot water equipment load helping things along.  

 

So to wrap up, I?d say 15 SEER units absolutely can be one part of a bigger picture achieving a 10% LEED performance rating.

 

Apologies for the walls of text? sometimes the quick & easy answer is ?there aren?t any quick and easy answers!?  Hope this discussion is helpful to you and yours in any case!

Robert,

Simple answer is "No" - that is my point - it more than likely never will.  You have to include all of your proposed energy conservation measures that you are likely to apply into a single model with your user and climate/local specific schedules and profiles included to see what the aggregated savings maybe.  You can run multiple models changing only one component to do some sensitivity analysis to see what variables/measures may give you more dramatic changes in total energy consumption, cost, carbon  emissions, indoor comfort, life cycle cost, life cycle assessment, etc.  (which ever your client and you are using as your decision making criteria).

As for the question regarding 10% energy reduction using 15 SEER equipment: I've gotten 10% better energy performance using 90.1 minimum SEER compliant equipment and effecting change in lighting power density, lighting controls, controllable plug loads and better envelope/less infiltration, better ventilation and properly downsizing the mechanical systems.  You do not always have to improve the mechanical efficiency of the HVAC equipment to achieve an energy efficiency improvement target.  It is a whole building analysis that the owner's O&M behavior can have a major impact on.  Conversely, I've had bleeding edge efficiency and complexity in the energy using systems at some facilities and the buildings perform worse than an minimum code compliant building  or a local median EUI when a custodian who knows how to turn things off at night could have done better - when the owner does not understand how the design team intended the building to be operated when they made their analysis.  For example, I just investigated a net zero energy house that was donated to an international non-profit.  It has 22 SEER geothermal heat pumps, an envelope so tight it had no air measurable leakage at 80 pascals, LED lighting, solar water heater, energy recovery ventilator, solar PV, SIPS panel wall system, commercial grade low e windows and a sophisticated energy monitoring system.  It is built right next to a conventionally built house, stick framed, minimum residential code compliant construction with 13 SEER air source heat pumps.  Both are occupied by single mothers with two children.  The net zero house has worse energy performance than the code minimum house almost entirely due to occupant behavior. I personally did not believe you could operate that house such that it would ever consume much energy, but you can.  In this case the owner was not determined until after the house was constructed and did not have a stake in the design and was not trained on the special features of the house when it was offered to her.  Now that she has been educated I can see some reductions - but the house is still falling way short of its goal of net zerobecause the owner is just unwilling to change her lifestyle no matter what the nergy costs are.

I suppose the modeling software and how it treats energy might have something to do with it too (Note to CA and TDV), but for starters the modeling software will look at actual conditions in the particular place where the project is located.  As an absurd case, if there was no cooling needed, an infinite SEER would show no improvement.  SEER is for "typical" and each project is not necessarily typical.  For somewhere with a high cooling demand, SEER should have a greater effect, but cooling is only a small part of the energy budget.

I can appreciate that with "10% better walls, 10% better windows (or how about 10% less windows), 10% lower lighting wattages, 10% more efficient hot water, all compared to the standard, you could get 10% better using a SEER 14.3, but I have never gotten that result.  I suppose that I need to look harder at the other legs on the stool.  For me, I need SEER 17 to get to 10% better in California with a somewhat lopsided stool.  I am curious what experience others have.

The theoretical answer may be "Make everything else use 10% less energy than standard and have a SEER 14.3 AC unit, and you're done" but to be honest, that doesn't ever work for me.

Maybe a better question is; have you ever gotten 10% better than ASHRAE 90.1 with a 15 SEER AC system?  In a real project with real people fighting over costs, etc.?

	Robert, 

	SEER is a seasonal energy efficiency ratio and is unitless.  It is the "cooling output during a typical cooling-season divided by the total electric energy input during the same period": http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_energy_efficiency_ratio.  A unit with 10% or better seasonal cooling energy efficiency over a 13 SEER unit would have a SEER rating of 14.3 or greater (1.1x13) if all other operating parameters were held constant.  See link for definitions and other references.

	A very simple way of looking at LEED & energy, which I come back to often for discussions on that level, is to consider a building's performance like a tripod with three important legs:  Lights, Mechanical, and Envelope.  If any of those legs is too short, the tripod falls over.
	
	Building on that analogy, to do 10% better than a LEED baseline, a good starting place is to have at least:
	-  10% better lighting (10% lower LPD),
	-  10% better HVAC & hot water heating (10% better efficiencies), and
	-  10% better envelope (10% more insulation in walls/roof, 10% better windows).
	For each of these, you can source the baseline/prescriptive levels from the standard of your choosing.
	
	Overperforming in one area can sometimes make up for underperfomance in another, but with diminishing returns.  Amazing HVAC equipment/design has a harder time shining when you have a poor envelope and/or the lighting designer treats LPD's as a "budget" they have to use up.  For such reasons, it's advisable to always consider building performance in holistic fashion in early/broader discussions.
	
	That's my (simple) take anyway!

John, you are right on target on all points!
Keep in mind, though, that weather often has a greater impact on the existing buildings that need a lot of help.  They don't have the high performance envelopes and are not as likely to get a "makeover".

Energy Cost Comment-
Working for the Army, we have many similar buildings in many different locations. We once had 2 buildings each in the same climate type, designed the same, but they differed by 5 leed points when it came to energy savings.  When we look into why, it turned out the only difference was utility rates.

Weather Comment-
What I have seem with a few high performance buildings is that the weather is becoming a very small factor.

Primary office building with a lot of computer equipment, well insulated roof and walls with energy recovery for outside air and a low outside wall to square footage ratio (large cubes.)

Controls Comment-
I also think that controls are one of the most crucial keys to energy savings.  I have toured too many buildings when they were not occupied and the outside air dampers were 100% open.  I don't have a site, but I remember one article that said most buildings could save 30% in energy just by changing how it is controlled.  Less efficient equipment turned off is always more efficient that highly efficient equipment running when it doesn't need to.

Weighing in from the ?outside?, I agree very much with Joe on the future of building control systems being based on sensors but I believe sensors augmented with precision, highly localized weather data - forecasts which will drive predictive control, and current and recent condition data for sensor verification and external variables not being measured.

Man, every time I start a reply 3 more have come out, haha!  I think we?re all pretty much on the same page though =).  This is largely written in response to Robert?s most recent reply:



Applying 10% improvement to lighting/mechanical equipment/envelope is merely a strategy for achieving performance figures in the right ballpark once energy modeling begins.  No more and no less.  I can attest this has worked well for me in the past, but I never meant to imply ?..and you?re done.?



This is just a means of getting the ball rolling and ensuring the important decision makers understand they have a role to play.



I agree completely regarding the limits of SEER and every other standardized efficiency rating I?ve worked with.  Seasonal and steady state efficiencies are NEVER direct indicators of actual system consumptions, they are merely representations of performance under specific conditions.  That said, they do have a useful time & place which occurs at the beginning of a project, before a more detailed analysis can be made with energy models or otherwise.  SEER may or may not be an inadequate efficiency metric for your specific climate, but that doesn?t change what defines your baseline equipment.



If the goal is simply to reduce heating and cooling energy consumptions of your HVAC systems by XX%, and I can?t build something resembling the final design for an energy model, I simply can?t offer a better answer than ?improve your heating and cooling efficiencies by XX%,? recognizing this alone will not get you there if your lighting consumptions and envelope performance do not do their part.



A black and white answer to what minimum performance is required of any system for any specific LEED project goal is truly unapproachable until you start the energy model that will determine the results ;).



As it happens however, I can answer Robert?s most recent hypothetical almost directly:  I have performed a preliminary study for a building in the vicinity of El Paso, TX using 15 SEER AHU?s with energy recovery.  I determined a 30% LEED improvement would have been attainable using an envelope matching 90.1 baseline constructions, but this entailed a roughly 50% LPD reduction (I would have performed the lighting design and can attest this was achievable), and a healthy laundry list of EEM?s for mechanical, with a heavy service hot water equipment load helping things along.



So to wrap up, I?d say 15 SEER units absolutely can be one part of a bigger picture achieving a 10% LEED performance rating.



Apologies for the walls of text? sometimes the quick & easy answer is ?there aren?t any quick and easy answers!?  Hope this discussion is helpful to you and yours in any case!

Robert,

Simple answer is "No" - that is my point - it more than likely never will.  You have to include all of your proposed energy conservation measures that you are likely to apply into a single model with your user and climate/local specific schedules and profiles included to see what the aggregated savings maybe.  You can run multiple models changing only one component to do some sensitivity analysis to see what variables/measures may give you more dramatic changes in total energy consumption, cost, carbon  emissions, indoor comfort, life cycle cost, life cycle assessment, etc.  (which ever your client and you are using as your decision making criteria).

As for the question regarding 10% energy reduction using 15 SEER equipment: I've gotten 10% better energy performance using 90.1 minimum SEER compliant equipment and effecting change in lighting power density, lighting controls, controllable plug loads and better envelope/less infiltration, better ventilation and properly downsizing the mechanical systems.  You do not always have to improve the mechanical efficiency of the HVAC equipment to achieve an energy efficiency improvement target.  It is a whole building analysis that the owner's O&M behavior can have a major impact on.  Conversely, I've had bleeding edge efficiency and complexity in the energy using systems at some facilities and the buildings perform worse than an minimum code compliant building  or a local median EUI when a custodian who knows how to turn things off at night could have done better - when the owner does not understand how the design team intended the building to be operated when they made their analysis.  For example, I just investigated a net zero energy house that was donated to an international non-profit.  It has 22 SEER geothermal heat pumps, an envelope so tight it had no air measurable leakage at 80 pascals, LED lighting, solar water heater, energy recovery ventilator, solar PV, SIPS panel wall system, commercial grade low e windows and a sophisticated energy monitoring system.  It is built right next to a conventionally built house, stick framed, minimum residential code compliant construction with 13 SEER air source heat pumps.  Both are occupied by single mothers with two children.  The net zero house has worse energy performance than the code minimum house almost entirely due to occupant behavior. I personally did not believe you could operate that house such that it would ever consume much energy, but you can.  In this case the owner was not determined until after the house was constructed and did not have a stake in the design and was not trained on the special features of the house when it was offered to her.  Now that she has been educated I can see some reductions - but the house is still falling way short of its goal of net zerobecause the owner is just unwilling to change her lifestyle no matter what the nergy costs are.

I suppose the modeling software and how it treats energy might have something to do with it too (Note to CA and TDV), but for starters the modeling software will look at actual conditions in the particular place where the project is located.  As an absurd case, if there was no cooling needed, an infinite SEER would show no improvement.  SEER is for "typical" and each project is not necessarily typical.  For somewhere with a high cooling demand, SEER should have a greater effect, but cooling is only a small part of the energy budget.

I can appreciate that with "10% better walls, 10% better windows (or how about 10% less windows), 10% lower lighting wattages, 10% more efficient hot water, all compared to the standard, you could get 10% better using a SEER 14.3, but I have never gotten that result.  I suppose that I need to look harder at the other legs on the stool.  For me, I need SEER 17 to get to 10% better in California with a somewhat lopsided stool.  I am curious what experience others have.

The theoretical answer may be "Make everything else use 10% less energy than standard and have a SEER 14.3 AC unit, and you're done" but to be honest, that doesn't ever work for me.

Maybe a better question is; have you ever gotten 10% better than ASHRAE 90.1 with a 15 SEER AC system?  In a real project with real people fighting over costs, etc.?

        Robert,

        SEER is a seasonal energy efficiency ratio and is unitless.  It is the "cooling output during a typical cooling-season divided by the total electric energy input during the same period": http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_energy_efficiency_ratio.  A unit with 10% or better seasonal cooling energy efficiency over a 13 SEER unit would have a SEER rating of 14.3 or greater (1.1x13) if all other operating parameters were held constant.  See link for definitions and other references.

        I absolutely agree with you, Nick, on achieving 10% better, but all the trades point to the others.  It's kind of comical, actually.

        I guess my question on this list could be rephrased, using your approach, as "What SEER is 10% better than SEER 13?"

        A very simple way of looking at LEED & energy, which I come back to often for discussions on that level, is to consider a building's performance like a tripod with three important legs:  Lights, Mechanical, and Envelope.  If any of those legs is too short, the tripod falls over.

        Building on that analogy, to do 10% better than a LEED baseline, a good starting place is to have at least:
        -  10% better lighting (10% lower LPD),
        -  10% better HVAC & hot water heating (10% better efficiencies), and
        -  10% better envelope (10% more insulation in walls/roof, 10% better windows).
        For each of these, you can source the baseline/prescriptive levels from the standard of your choosing.

        Overperforming in one area can sometimes make up for underperfomance in another, but with diminishing returns.  Amazing HVAC equipment/design has a harder time shining when you have a poor envelope and/or the lighting designer treats LPD's as a "budget" they have to use up.  For such reasons, it's advisable to always consider building performance in holistic fashion in early/broader discussions.

        That's my (simple) take anyway!

        I know that LEED is way more than just energy, and energy is way more than just equipment, but just for a basis, what SEER and EER do people have to use to get 10% better than ASHRAE 90.1 to qualify for LEED?  I also know that you don't have to use ASHRAE 90.1, but that is what I am doing.

        So, what does it take?

        My shot - Residential Apartment, individual DX units, 17 SEER and 13 EER in California CZ 12 (Mostly cooling).

Hi all,
I have been away from this conversation for a couple of days due to a death
in my family.
This conversation is great. I'm not sure we have ever really answered
Roberts original question though.
First - my apologies to Vikram for misquoting his statement about LEED
being cost centric in lieu of consumption focused a couple of days ago. He
is absolutely correct.

I agree with several of the thoughts in this recent thread. Stepping away
from modeling for a few thoughts.  Controls, or lets say operations, are
key. We have some very sophisticated control systems installed in the field
and some pretty slick dashboards and analytic software available to look at
building use, energy efficiency, indoor air quality, indoor comfort, human
behavior and user feedback networks. Some are going so far as to measure
the heart rate and respiration rate of a person in a cubicle and begin to
inform control decisions unknown to the occupant. This is all good stuff.

However, it's my experience that many of the larger control systems rely on
legacy code and programs that are often 20 to 30 years old (nothing
necessarily wrong with that if it works). But what I've seen is the
technology is well beyond most average facility managers training to fully
utilize, it's beyond most of the control technicians installing the systems
skill sets to set up properly (when I commission a control system I often
see where the technician has pulled in literally dozens of legacy, canned
sequences and then blocked or turned off much of the code trying to meet a
specified sequence of operations, gets confused and can't hardly tell what
sequence or logic is being used to control the system at the end of the
day). In most cases the owner does not get properly trained and the
valuable, somewhat self heeling features of a lot of control systems,
alerts and notifications never even get set up.

To bring that back to modeling, much of the modeling software we use for
design cannot model most control sequences we can dream up and most
engineers are still using modeling for load design only - they write a
sequence and expect a control contractor to be able to make it work
- energy models are only being applied when a client or a rating system
require it.

To tie back to John's last comment below - 100% agreement - our local
school district, 150 buildings, 8 million sf, $11 million per year in
utilities has a dedicated energy manager and a very sophisticated facility
management system. They are beginning to save upwards of 10 to 15 percent
just by analyzing utility interval data on their larger, more energy
intensive schools, finding and turning off as much as possible when not
needed. They are doing this without energy efficiency upgrades or control
upgrades. Then they are setting energy targets, recalibrating their control
systems setting up good alerts and notifications in the system to squeeze
everything out of what they have and finally writing a strategic energy
management plan for future construction and upgrades. They are fixing their
problems and turning things off first before buying more bells and
whistles. There is something to be said for simplicity.  It seems to be
working.

To Jame's point - existing buildings are at a disadvantage. With more
efficient lighting and more efficient HVAC equipment I'm seeing plug loads
and water heating use bigger pieces of the pie chart.

Thanks to everyone, and this thread can go as long as we want it to.  
For me, I got three or four main points:

1.    To achieve anything, all systems must achieve the same result.  If 
one doesn't pull its weight, well, the goal is missed.  I had this 
resolved on a two hour telephone call with the lighting engineers on the 
project I was working on when I asked the original question.  This 
helped a lot and got the lighting systems pulling their share of the 
load.  Likewise windows, walls, roofs, and mechanical systems.

2.    My experience with the same project, using Energy Pro for 
modeling, shows that SEER 15 gives about 15% better building results 
than SEER 13, which is to be expected from the math, but unless all the 
systems achieve 15% better, well, you don't make that goal.  SEER 17 
does NOT give 30% better building results. More like 20% better and 
again, all the systems need to pull their weight.  In my climate zone 
(CA central valley), more SEER does not equate linearly to more 
performance.  Ever higher numbers give less marginal improvement.  I 
believe this is also to be expected given the fact that infinite SEER 
doesn't give infinite savings and all savings due to SEER require a load 
to be met.  I still don't have a good handle on this, but I'm getting 
closer.

3.    Controls are key.  I just implemented a pneumatic to DDC changeout 
along with some split systems for critical zones for the purpose of 
shutting down the systems at night and on weekends. Big savings there.  
But if the controls aren't right, well, you get the idea.

4.    Process loads can eat you up.  Shut them down!

5.    Utility rates rule the roost.  If you can use this to your 
advantage, it can be a big advantage.


Great conversation, folks.  Thanks for taking the time to think and reply...

Message-ID: <CAHA4r_kpMpAfuxVrH1t-aJR7_D22bmfJMjZKwhxUvLyZTv1GHg@mail.gmail.com>

I've ALWAYS avoided predictive modeling (telling a client your energy usage
will be below X) as I've been scared. Now I'm pretty deep into a project
performing Green Star energy modeling and my client has popped the question.

We've discussed "why it is hard" and the big three un-knowns: Infiltration,
Occupant behavior!!, and Actual Weather. They still want me to go forward
and are willing to put a bunch of caviates and an agreed margin on the
results.

This is an old 1930's building 200,000 sq ft with original metal window
frames (single pane) that will not be replaced (heritage). We're insulating
the roof and basement ceiling and a completely new HVAC system. Is there a
standard process I can follow or specific suggestions the community could
offer?

So far my idea is to try and guesstimate infiltration, box in comfort
behavior with lease agreements and a survey, and put some margin on weather.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] About baseline systems in LEED eac 1.3 modeling for a
	system with a heated network in AHU and Electric in FCU
Message-ID: <95F0356A0810C44AB56ADD48FA44184101C39E04@greengo>

Hi all ;

 

I have a question concerning LEED eac 1.3, simulation.

 

I have a renovation project of an 7th floor building of more than 150
000 ft2 in which the HVAC system is composed of an AHU heated/cooled by
a heating and a cooling urban network. The prehated/precooled air then
goes into fan coil unit batteries of the FCU which are cooled by the
cooling network BUT the heating batteries in the FCU are electrical (not
heated by the heating network). By looking into the Tables 3.1.1.A and
table G3.1.1.B  from ASHRAE standard 90.1-2007 I can't conclude if my
baseline system is 7  or 8. So that is my question, based in your
experience, baseline system is 7 or system 8?

 

Thanks in advance for any advice on this,

 

Regards

All:

Forwarding a message to the list-serve.... The Sim-EB software is distributed free-of-charge.

(Note:  If you don't currently include Sim-EB as a simulation weapon in your arsenal, you might consider giving it a look. For working with existing buildings that have operational data, Sim-EB contains a wicked powerful module for digesting user-defined generic high resolution metered data and performing cluster analysis against it. The results is a suggested patchwork of 24-hour schedule definitions representing the data, which can then be transformed into realistic, representative data-driven schedules for 8760 model input.  This is only one of Sim-EB's many innovative features, and it does include documentation.)

All the Best,

_Chris

Get utility bills (if you can), or Use Energy Star or CBECs for a reference building (CBECs median may be higher than a 1930 building !); based on these, you can present a range between 'simulated' savings and 'estimated' savings.

I've been getting within 10% without calibration on the last five or six

Get utility bills (if you can), or Use Energy Star or CBECs for a
reference building (CBECs median may be higher than a 1930 building !);
based on these, you can present a range between 'simulated' savings and
'estimated' savings.

I've ALWAYS avoided predictive modeling (telling a client your energy
usage will be below X) as I've been scared. Now I'm pretty deep into a
project performing Green Star energy modeling and my client has popped the
question.

 

We've discussed "why it is hard" and the big three un-knowns:
Infiltration, Occupant behavior!!, and Actual Weather. They still want me
to go forward and are willing to put a bunch of caviates and an agreed
margin on the results. 

 

This is an old 1930's building 200,000 sq ft with original metal window
frames (single pane) that will not be replaced (heritage). We're
insulating the roof and basement ceiling and a completely new HVAC system.
Is there a standard process I can follow or specific suggestions the
community could offer?

 

So far my idea is to try and guesstimate infiltration, box in comfort
behavior with lease agreements and a survey, and put some margin on
weather.

Student Travel Awards ? Supporting students to attend BS2013
Travel to IBPSA Conferences can be an expensive business ? especially for students. In order to assist as many students as possible to participate in BS 2013 in Chambray, France, IBPSA will grant a number of travel awards of up to 1000USD to students presenting papers. The number of places is limited to a maximum of 5 grants and as a result is highly competitive.

The selection committee bases its decisions upon the following selection criteria:

?           overall quality of the paper;

?           relevance of contribution to the field of and/or furthering the effective application of building simulation;

?           need for financial assistance, evidenced in a letter of recommendation from the student?s supervisor/ advisor of studies (must be on university letterhead).


To be eligible, the student must be:

?           enrolled in a graduate programme related to building simulation at the time of the conference; AND

?           the thesis project must be directly related to building simulation.

Applications MUST be supported by a letter of recommendation from the student?s supervisor/ advisor of studies. Applications for the award must be made by 31 January, 2013 via e-mail to
pieter.dewilde at plymouth.ac.uk. The subject heading of the e-mail should be "Student Travel Award - paper XXX" where XXX is the three-digit reference number for your paper.
The e-mail application must include the following:
       The student's name;
       The name of the programme, department, faculty, and university;
       The title of the PhD or Master's research;
       The name of the student's supervisor(s)/ advisor(s);
       A scanned version of the faculty recommendation letter on university letterhead in PDF format. (Note that the original letter must be presented to the Conference Secretariat at the conference).

The selection committee will base its decision upon a review of the final manuscripts. Therefore, to be eligible the student MUST submit the paper by the full paper deadline of 31 January, 2013.
Nominations should be sent in the first instance to Pieter de Wilde as representative of the Awards Committee (pieter.dewilde at plymouth.ac.uk) by the closing date of the 31st January 2013.

We would like as many nominations as possible, so please contact me to discuss a possible nomination if required.

Payment will be made either to the academic department before the conference or directly to the student at the conference.

I don't believe there can be any hard rules about the percentage of 
error when calibrating a model.  The margin of error is proportional 
to the amount of information available.  The rest is engineering and 
experience.  Attached is a typical report we use to illustrate how 
close the calibration is.

This particular project is a community centre, pool, with an arena 
adjacent for heat exchange.  A tricky one.

Subject: MIT Building Technology & IBPSA Boston Event - CFD Techniques for Natural Ventilation and Thermal Comfort Prediction

Dear colleagues and friends in the Boston area:

The Building Technology Program at MIT and IBPSA Boston are pleased to announce a presentation by Professor Malcolm Cook (Loughborough University) on January 31st at  noon EST in the Long Lounge (building 7 room 431) at MIT (http://whereis.mit.edu/). Everyone is welcome.

Christoph


Low Energy Buildings: CFD Techniques for Natural Ventilation and Thermal Comfort Prediction
Malcolm's presentation will cover both his research and consultancy activities. This will cover the work he has undertaken during his time spent working with architects on low energy building design, with a particular focus on natural ventilation and passive cooling strategies, and the role computer simulation can play in this design process. Malcolm will talk about the simulation techniques employed, as well as the innovative passive design principles that have led to some of the UK's most energy efficient buildings. In addition to UK building projects, the talk but will include work Malcolm completed as part of the design of the LEED Gold award winning Harm A. Weber Academic Center at Judson University, in Elgin, near Chicago. This building, which comprises office and library space, employs a hybrid ventilation and cooling strategy which exploits the maximum benefit from natural ventilation before reverting to air-conditioning during the harsh winter and peak summer months. Malcolm will also talk about recent research projects, including his work on Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of unsteady flows in naturally ventilated buildings and the development of a new simulation system which couples CFD with a model of human physiology and thermal comfort.

About the speaker:

Malcolm Cook is Professor of Building Performance Analysis at Loughborough University. He is based in the Building Energy Research Group in the School of Civil and Building Engineering and leads their work in the area of ventilation modeling and low energy building design. He obtained his first degree from Manchester University (UK) in Mathematics and completed his PhD in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling of buoyancy-driven natural ventilation at De Montfort University (Leicester, UK). He has worked on research projects funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, the Department of Health and the European Union. He has completed many consultancy projects for a wide range of clients worldwide which have included design and simulation work for health care buildings, schools and modern library buildings. His work is published in over 70 refereed conference and journal papers and has contributed to awards for innovative building design, including the RIBA presidents gold medal for practice-based architecture (2007), the CIBSE environmental initiative of the year award (2006) and a LEED Gold rated Academic Center for Judson College, IL (2008). Malcolm is a member of the CIBSE Natural Ventilation group, vice-chairman of the CIBSE Building Simulation group and chairman of the England affiliate of the International Building Performance Simulation Association.

Nice graphs, Chris!  Even nicer calibration!
Random comment regarding % deviation for an individual month: Natural gas consumption often goes to near-zero in summer months.  This sometimes makes any deviation from the actual usage a very large number, which in reality may be a tiny fraction of total use.  There's no simple solution for this; it's not worth worrying about the deviation because it's so small a fraction of overall use, but it looks really bad to non-technical readers.  I've been reporting R-squared values calculated from the monthly deviation.  Not perfect, but it places the focus on the overall month-by-month match instead of a single month.

Morgan, you apparently work with excellent commissioning agents and very responsible owner / building managers!  10% sounds too good to be true.

I've been getting within 10% without calibration on the last five or six buildings I've done where I've tracked the bills afterwards.  The key is to be thorough and careful.  If you're not getting reasonably close, how can you justify your recommendations for energy efficiency measures?

Morgan - 10% is pretty damn close - well done!

That being said - I would like to respond to the second part of your email. Personally I think it is possible to be slightly inaccurate, but still correct.

In my experience it is when you are in the early stages (when there is a huge margin of error) that the modeling is actually at its most useful. Very often it's the early on normative modeling that leads to good design decisions. For example when modeling a VAV system versus a chilled beam system, I might not have the exact BTU number, but if I can get the usage patterns appropriately represented (cooling, heating, fans & reheat) then the result might not be 'accurate', but correct. Your overall numbers might go up and down with occupancy and weather, but the decision still remains a good one. This is where having the experience and the backing of a good database of comparable buildings is invaluable. CBECS is good for overall usage, but it's even better to be able to look at how the BTUs are spent over the year. Investing the time to collect utility bills for your building type is worth a lot.

Often we worry about the accuracy of our results to the nth degree before making recommendations, but by the time we come up with the magic number its too late - the design has morphed, or been finalized so your numbers are either outdated or redundant (in some cases both).

Get utility bills (if you can), or Use Energy Star or CBECs for a reference building (CBECs median may be higher than a 1930 building !); based on these, you can present a range between 'simulated' savings and 'estimated' savings.

I've ALWAYS avoided predictive modeling (telling a client your energy usage will be below X) as I've been scared. Now I'm pretty deep into a project performing Green Star energy modeling and my client has popped the question.

We've discussed "why it is hard" and the big three un-knowns: Infiltration, Occupant behavior!!, and Actual Weather. They still want me to go forward and are willing to put a bunch of caviates and an agreed margin on the results.

This is an old 1930's building 200,000 sq ft with original metal window frames (single pane) that will not be replaced (heritage). We're insulating the roof and basement ceiling and a completely new HVAC system. Is there a standard process I can follow or specific suggestions the community could offer?

So far my idea is to try and guesstimate infiltration, box in comfort behavior with lease agreements and a survey, and put some margin on weather.

I don't worry too much about the monthy deviation.  It is one more 
indicator to use to help understand the differences between the model 
and actual bills.

Those graphs are part of an Excel workbook that is used to adjust the 
model characteristics, shells out to run the model, then sucks the 
hourly results back into the workbook.  It is a very fast cycle - 
review, adjust run the model and review again.  No "hand work" to 
extrac the results or to adjust the model.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] SEER and Fan Energy
Message-ID: <510932B7.1000704@wichert.org>

This forum has discussed fan energy before, and since that time I have 
grappled with the concept of fan power, specifically how to avoid double 
counting fan power since even indoor fans are included in SEER ratings.

I suppose that I should start by confirming that indoor supply and 
return fans are included in SEER ratings.  I have read the DOE 49 CFR 
Pt. 430, Subpt. B, App. M UNIFORM TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING THE ENERGY 
CONSUMPTION OF CENTRAL AIR CONDITIONERS AND HEAT PUMPS.  It seems clear 
in that method that indoor fans are included in the power and energy 
calculations.  If not, please let me know what I am missing.

OK, if indoor supply and return fans are included in the SEER rating, 
then why would we put additional fan energy into our calculations?  Does 
EQuest, EnergyPro, E+, and all the rest do some math to subtract this 
out, and if so, how is that done?

Sorry for the basic question, but I have thought about this a lot and 
haven't reached a comfortable solution.  At one point I thought that the 
SEER calculation did not account for indoor fans, but I now find that to 
be wrong.


Your thoughts are appreciated.

Hey Morgan:

 

Does your data include years 3 to 6 after construction?  It would be great
to see if usage is in line with predictions after real work use of the
building for a while.  What type and size of buildings were they in what
geography?

 

Thanks,

 

Andy

Morgan - 10% is pretty damn close - well done! 

 

That being said - I would like to respond to the second part of your email.
Personally I think it is possible to be slightly inaccurate, but still
correct.  

 

In my experience it is when you are in the early stages (when there is a
huge margin of error) that the modeling is actually at its most useful. Very
often it's the early on normative modeling that leads to good design
decisions. For example when modeling a VAV system versus a chilled beam
system, I might not have the exact BTU number, but if I can get the usage
patterns appropriately represented (cooling, heating, fans & reheat) then
the result might not be 'accurate', but correct. Your overall numbers might
go up and down with occupancy and weather, but the decision still remains a
good one. This is where having the experience and the backing of a good
database of comparable buildings is invaluable. CBECS is good for overall
usage, but it's even better to be able to look at how the BTUs are spent
over the year. Investing the time to collect utility bills for your building
type is worth a lot. 

 

Often we worry about the accuracy of our results to the nth degree before

Dear All:

I have had several request to extend the deadline for nominations to the IBPSA Student Travel Awards. In order to accomodate those still working on their papers, but also taking into account practical constraints at my own end, the deadline will be extended to Thursday 14 February 2013.
All other details remain as posted. As a reminder, the earlier call for nominations is copied below.

Best regards,
Pieter de Wilde



-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Student Travel Awards ? Supporting students to attend BS2013
Travel to IBPSA Conferences can be an expensive business ? especially for students. In order to assist as many students as possible to participate in BS 2013 in Chambray, France, IBPSA will grant a number of travel awards of up to 1000USD to students presenting papers. The number of places is limited to a maximum of 5 grants and as a result is highly competitive.

The selection committee bases its decisions upon the following selection criteria:

?           overall quality of the paper;

?           relevance of contribution to the field of and/or furthering the effective application of building simulation;

?           need for financial assistance, evidenced in a letter of recommendation from the student?s supervisor/ advisor of studies (must be on university letterhead).


To be eligible, the student must be:

?           enrolled in a graduate programme related to building simulation at the time of the conference; AND

?           the thesis project must be directly related to building simulation.

Applications MUST be supported by a letter of recommendation from the student?s supervisor/ advisor of studies. Applications for the award must be made by Thursday 14 February, 2013 via e-mail to
pieter.dewilde at plymouth.ac.uk. The subject heading of the e-mail should be "Student Travel Award - paper XXX" where XXX is the three-digit reference number for your paper.
The e-mail application must include the following:
       The student's name;
       The name of the programme, department, faculty, and university;
       The title of the PhD or Master's research;
       The name of the student's supervisor(s)/ advisor(s);
       A scanned version of the faculty recommendation letter on university letterhead in PDF format. (Note that the original letter must be presented to the Conference Secretariat at the conference).

The selection committee will base its decision upon a review of the final manuscripts. Therefore, to be eligible the student MUST submit the paper by the full paper deadline.
Nominations should be sent in the first instance to Pieter de Wilde as representative of the Awards Committee (pieter.dewilde at plymouth.ac.uk) by the closing date of the 14 February 2013.

We would like as many nominations as possible, so please contact me to discuss a possible nomination if required.

Payment will be made either to the academic department before the conference or directly to the student at the conference.

Best regards,

Pieter de Wilde

Robert, I don?t know if I understood your question; If I did this is my
opinion: In some cases Indoor fans are included in SEER (E.g. Rooftop).
Since you are modelling fans and Refrigeration cycle efficiency separately,
you need to subtract this energy from the SEER calculation. On the other
hand, additional fan power is related to the baseline for 90.1, and its
additional fan power your Baseline will use so that certain beneficial
aspects of the proposed design or equipment (eg. Merv 13 filter) are not
excluded from the project because of energy increase.

In *Energypro* you model the rooftop and you have inputs for Cooling

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Call for articles/news for IBPSA News April 2013
Message-ID: <0caa01cdff26$22978d50$67c6a7f0$@ac.uk>

Dear simulators,

 

The time is here again to submit articles and announcements for the upcoming
issue of IBPSA News (April 2013).  As usual, it would be good to receive an
announcement from each IBPSA Affiliate as to activities that have taken
place in their region, including conferences and meetings. Items related to
software news are also encouraged: new releases, updates, new versions,
training seminars, notable projects, etc. - all gratefully received. 

 

Please send the article(s) to me at your earliest convenience so they arrive
before 25th March 2013, if possible.

 

Many thanks in advance for your assistance and contributions.

 

Best regards,

 

Christina Hopfe

IBPSA News Editor-in-Chief

That makes sense, Glenn.  So it's a manual adjustment to the EIR.  In 
Energy Pro, which I use a lot, that can be done by using the 
"Compressor/Condenser Power" option and then adding the fan power in 
separately, but only for systems over five tons.  Smaller systems are 
stuck with SEER.

I think the problem I'm facing is that Energy Pro uses SEER for small 
systems, not EER/EIR.

If I understand the quandary you are referring to packaged systems where the fan energy is included in the package. In eQUEST - if you select the EER rating (or SEER rating) in the wizard, then its my understanding that the program does this automatically for you. However, if you are using the 90.1 methodology, then you probably want to go beyond the wizard. I developed the attached spreadsheet to parse out the energy by fan and cooling - feel free to use it. I would appreciate feedback from anyone willing to check my math and methodology.

I like some of Doug's points around bounding an assumption that is uncertain rather than arguing the exact assumption which if you are really lucky may be close to reality.

Books are probably a reasonably good insulator as they are cellulose and would have fine air gaps around them and possibly between the pages that act as an insulant so it gets back to the comment on 'fast' mass.  I think the CIBSE methods define something called thermal admittance as the ratio of conductivity to specific heat capacity.  What that means is a material can be heavy, but if it has a low conductivity or maybe finished with an insulative layer (think rubber backed carpet on concrete) then the ability for a material to absorb and release heat is diminished - the mass is no longer in close thermal contact.

I had the pleasure (or displeasure in the early stages) of diagnosing and rectifying a thermal comfort problem years ago where a new direct stick carpet was applied to a ground level slab that sat above a naturally ventilated carpark in a location that had an ambient winter design condition of 3C.  The slab was not fully insulated below so became quite cool in places where insulation was missing.  By our calcs (Therm and IES calibrated with an IR gun) the absence of a backing on the carpet resulted in the floor surface temperature being 1-2C cooler.  This was material from a radiant temperature asymmetry point of view but also in cooling low level air that resulted in an unacceptable dry bulb gradient.  We made the insulation continuous and the problem was solved but it was a real lesson in close coupling (fast) of thermal mass versus something that has less of an impact on the loads and thus temperatures.

So it does depend and you have to use engineering judgement, it isn't just the weight, it is how closely coupled (fast or slow ?) the mass is to the space.

My personal experience in modeling residential models is that they always lag more than you expect, so I've regularly responded by jacking up the internal mass.

Interesting topic, I look forward to getting my 2013 Fundamentals.

As we monitor more and more buildings in Australia, we are finding they are less dry bulb sensitive and more dew point or enthalpy sensitive.  This is a result of internal load dropping (lights as low as 5 W/m2 in offices and laptops with LED backlit screens at the docking stations), glass and facade technology improving, water-cooled cooling COPs being higher when drier (CW reset), ventilation rates increasing (higher ventilation loads), and supply air flow rates dropping (lower loads, more water based systems, lower design off-coil temps).  The latter two effects mean less % modulation of economy cycles from minimum outdoor air to full outside air ? 

So for me as global warming plays out it will be interesting to see how dew point extremes look relative to dry bulb extremes.  With the oceans warming, there will be more evaporation and storms ? .  A colleague informed me that Mackay in northern Queensland (near the Whitsundays and southern edge of the Great Barrier reef) recorded its highest ever dew point temperature on Tuesday at 28.3C with a coincident dry bulb of 32.8C - that's 24.7 g/kg of moisture!

I am not sure what florida's conditions are like, but for us that is very very humid.  Is there a scenario where the dry bulb extremes don't look that bad, but the added moisture in the air is where we get hit?  Most coils will increase their duty as on-coil wet bulb / dew point increases but at a point the cooling plant won't cope particularly with ambient wet bulb rising thus driving CW temperatures up.  So the traditional loads calculations may be a small issue, but the ventilation load and cooling COP could be far greater issues?

Beyond the paper quoted in another thread that Dru has written, are there other people out there looking at the dew point / moisture issue?  kind of like global humidification rather than global warming ?

Regards,
Graham

There are some differences, however, owing to a more recent period of record (generally 1986-2010 versus 1982-2006). For example, when compared to the 2009 edition, 99.6% heating dry-bulb temperatures have increased by 0.31?F (0.17?C) on average, and 0.4% cooling dry-bulb temperatures have increased by 0.18?F (0.10?C) on average. Similar trends are observed for other design temperatures. The root mean square differences are 0.74?F (0.41?C) for the 99.6% heating dry-bulb values and 0.70?F (0.39?C) for 0.4% cooling dry-bulb. The increases noted here are generally consistent with the discussion in the section on Impacts of Climate Change.

Vikram,

 

I agree with your assessment of the way eQUEST deals with packaged
systems fan energy and cooling efficiency through the wizard.  I always
end up using the detailed interface instead though.

 

Thanks for sending the spreadsheet.  I did look at it and made a few
edits that I will describe below.  I would also appreciate any feedback
from anyone.

 

*         I edited the lookup table to find the next size up motor hp
based on bhp; this is to find the motor efficiency only

*         I used different fan cfm for the example units you listed (400
cfm/ton)

*         I changed some of the units of measure to kW instead of Watts
(just personal preference)

*         The main change I made was to deal with fan heat.  Rated
capacity and efficiency are based on total input power and net cooling
output.  So in order to deal with the fan separately we need to subtract
the fan input electricity from the unit electricity input (as was done),
but we also need to subtract the fan heat from the net cooling capacity
to arrive at the gross cooling capacity.  The gross EER and EIR are then
calculated with fan input and heat removed.  After eQUEST adds the fan
input electricity and fan heat then you end up with the rated efficiency
(if you're at rated conditions).  I added columns related to fan heat
and adjusted the EER and EIR equations.  You can change Fan Heat Frac.
To zero (as if the fan motor is outside of the unit) to see the impact.


 

Hopefully this is of help to some.

 

Best regards,

 

Mike

If I understand the quandary you are referring to packaged systems where
the fan energy is included in the package. In eQUEST - if you select the
EER rating (or SEER rating) in the wizard, then its my understanding
that the program does this automatically for you. However, if you are
using the 90.1 methodology, then you probably want to go beyond the
wizard. I developed the attached spreadsheet to parse out the energy by
fan and cooling - feel free to use it. I would appreciate feedback from
anyone willing to check my math and methodology.

That makes sense, Glenn.  So it's a manual adjustment to the EIR.  In
Energy Pro, which I use a lot, that can be done by using the
"Compressor/Condenser Power" option and then adding the fan power in
separately, but only for systems over five tons.  Smaller systems are
stuck with SEER.

 

I think the problem I'm facing is that Energy Pro uses SEER for small
systems, not EER/EIR.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] SEER and Fan Energy

The testing and calculations for SEER include a small amount of supply air fan heat.

Suggest reviewing AHRI Standard 210/240-2008, particularly Table 11 on page 20 (same as Table 2 in 10 CFR Part 430 which is shown further down in AHRI 210/240-2008 on page 56).

http://www.ahrinet.org/search+standards.aspx

For example, for a 4-ton cooling system the minimum external static pressure for testing is only 0.2 in. H2O.   In real systems installed in the field, the external pressure drop due to ductwork, etc. is typically much higher that this test value.  That is why its typically best to subtract the fan power and enter "gross" cooling capacity in the software, and then model fan power separately using more reasonable external static pressures than those used for lab testing to support the SEER calculations.

If I understand the quandary you are referring to packaged systems where the fan energy is included in the package. In eQUEST - if you select the EER rating (or SEER rating) in the wizard, then its my understanding that the program does this automatically for you. However, if you are using the 90.1 methodology, then you probably want to go beyond the wizard. I developed the attached spreadsheet to parse out the energy by fan and cooling - feel free to use it. I would appreciate feedback from anyone willing to check my math and methodology.

That makes sense, Glenn.  So it's a manual adjustment to the EIR.  In Energy Pro, which I use a lot, that can be done by using the "Compressor/Condenser Power" option and then adding the fan power in separately, but only for systems over five tons.  Smaller systems are stuck with SEER.



I think the problem I'm facing is that Energy Pro uses SEER for small systems, not EER/EIR.

The conversion depends on the system type and other things, but for starters you can multiply SEER by something like 0.89 to estimate EER (then EIR = 3.413/EER, which I am sure you already know) if you don't have something better.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED Platinum Hotel Baseline Queries
Message-ID: <CAPtACNXJ6q_xCRnZL9JURpMV6C+fzOBgkxu5rj+gdRUFceWSQQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all

I am currently working on Hotel projects targeting to achieve LEED Platinum.

The hotels are located in Singapore, thus Climate 1 related baseline shall
be used.

As indicated in 90.1 App.G 3.11A, System2, PTHP is used as baseline for
hotel guestrooms.
I am using IES VE, and its ApacheHVAC module to simulate air con system.
What shall be the part load control strategy for PTHP? Say, when air con
setting point is 24 degree C, what will PTHP working condition if internal
air drops to 22 degree C? shall the fan be stilling running or shut down
together with compressor?

Another odd thing is: for proposed design, when guestroom is unoccupied,
the fresh air will be running without reduction in amount, and the FCU fan
will be operating at medium speed which will result in small supply air
volume and small fan power.
What shall be the impact on baseline PTHP? or how shall I set the PTHP for
part load performance?

Any advice and comments are welcome.

Best Regards

Additionally, I would also like to remind you about the:
Student Travel Awards ? Supporting students to attend BS2013
wich also has a nomination deadline of 31 January 2013.

Travel to IBPSA Conferences can be an expensive business ? especially for students. In order to assist as many students as possible to participate in BS 2013 in Chambray, France, IBPSA will grant a number of travel awards of up to 1000USD to students presenting papers. The number of places is limited to a maximum of 5 grants and as a result is highly competitive.

The selection committee bases its decisions upon the following selection criteria:

?           overall quality of the paper;

?           relevance of contribution to the field of and/or furthering the effective application of building simulation;

?           need for financial assistance, evidenced in a letter of recommendation from the student?s supervisor/ advisor of studies (must be on university letterhead).


To be eligible, the student must be:

?           enrolled in a graduate programme related to building simulation at the time of the conference; AND

?           the thesis project must be directly related to building simulation.

Applications MUST be supported by a letter of recommendation from the student?s supervisor/ advisor of studies. Applications for the award must be made by 31 January, 2013 via e-mail to
pieter.dewilde at plymouth.ac.uk. The subject heading of the e-mail should be "Student Travel Award - paper XXX" where XXX is the three-digit reference number for your paper.
The e-mail application must include the following:
       The student's name;
       The name of the programme, department, faculty, and university;
       The title of the PhD or Master's research;

When building with phase change materials for thermal mass rather then
concrete cost savings can be had--   (or so I have been told by builders)
You might make an excel workbook and price out each part to see for your
self but I seem to remember a price in the range of $120 per square foot
after design/install using 8 inch concrete and a bit less for PCM.

This really depends on how you design it. If you treat it as an ass on system then it could get expensive. However - if you can integrate it into the building design - (I worked on a building design with 8" concrete Trombe Walls that were used for lateral bracing as well as load bearing) - it doesn't have to be a cost add.

Dear all,

Does anyone have pricing information for Trombe walls handy from recent projects? While I'm particularly looking for costs pertaining to unventilated Trombe walls, any pricing information should be useful.

Thank you,

Thanks for clarifying the typo ... actually, the first, mistyped email may have done a better job of explaining how most folks try to design Trombe' walls...especially when trying to simulate them since most simulation programs do a lousy job of this...hence I'd go with the first email.

	simulation
Message-ID: <CAJ3R_V-FqSzmoRrPCF4imXmWxA1ySf8tbz_J9hQ-8SwHG5Hs=w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Community,

Again, I am coming to you for input in my efforts to make EnergyPlus run
faster.

As Nathaniel Jones suggested, I would like to consider not just the current
bottlenecks in EnergyPlus simulations, which are ran from models generated
by designers considering the limitations of the software and its
capabilities; I would like to know where you would like to get more
detailed, precise or accurate data from a simulation run, but accept lesser
data in the interest of getting your job finished in a limited amount of
time.

To boil it down, I'll ask my question this way: *if you could choose one
area in EnergyPlus to speed up, what would it be?  Another way of putting
it: where would you like more detail in your models, but you simplify in
order to reduce simulation execution time?*
*
*
Many thanks for your help and Happy New Year --

In-Reply-To: <CD0C9CCE.20CB%brown@h-m-g.com>
References: <CD0C9CCE.20CB%brown@h-m-g.com>
Message-ID: <50E78A43.2020305@whiteboxtechnologies.com>

I've developed quite a few (perhaps the earliest)  residential prototypes in my former 
days at LBNL: (1)  5 single-family and townhouse models for DOE (1981-1987),  (2) 66 
multi-family models for the Gas Research Institute (1985-1987), and (3) 120+  
single-family models for GRI (1988-1992).  I've also adapted the  single-family building 
model as the basic model behind the RESFEN program, and kept it updated  through 2008  for 
DOE's EnergyStar Window  analysis.

I have paper copies of the technical reports, and still functioning copies of the DOE-2.1E 
input files and parametric procedures.  I can upload these if there is still interest in 
this 20-year old work.
Other sources you should consider are :
   (1) Building America Program at NREL  ("Building America Performance Analysis 
Procedures", by Hendron, Anderson, et al. 2004)
   (2) the DEER program in California ("DEER - Database for Energy Efficient Resources", 
California Energy Commission, http://www.energyca.gov/deer)

I think if you're sticking only with EnergyPlus models, you will be missing out on a lot 
of previous work and experience.

My other comment is to not get too distracted by a multitude of building models that 
differ by code-required R-values, as seems to be the case with the PNNL IECC files. In my 
work, I've regarded these as simply permutations of a single model depending on location 
and vintage.  For example, the single-family building  model I now use for my window 
analysis is parameterized so that the building size, shell thermal integrities, and even 
number of floors are macro inputs feeding a single master model.  That to me was the only 
way to manage large data bases with tens of thousands of runs.

 Energy Modeling - Jan 30/31, Dallas
Message-ID: <50E78C8D.5070507@lbl.gov>

Building Energy Modeling: a Public-Sector Roadmap
*
*Open workshop hosted by the US DOE National Laboratories

Jan 30-31, 2013, Dallas Sheraton Hotel
*
*In the Spring of 2011, Rocky Mountain Institute hosted a two day summit 
that dealt with innovation in building energy modeling (BEM). 
Identifying BEM as a key enabling technology for building energy 
efficiency, the summit aimed to create 2-5 year roadmaps for significant 
aspects of BEM including software platforms, methods and processes, 
supporting resources, market drivers, and education. This workshop will 
attempt to define BEM priorities and strategies for a public sector road 
map of activities for the next 3-5 years. Topics for discussion include:

- Which currently important and emerging use cases of BEM need public 
support?

- Which areas of BEM need additional basic research, measurement, or 
validation?

- What are realistic and strategic goals for EnergyPlus functionality, 
speed, use, and user-support?

- What are realistic and strategic goals for supporting software tools 
like OpenStudio?

- How does the public sector push standards and interoperability?

I'll tell you one.  This happens on every energy modeling project.  The 
architect says "Why are you charging me to compute load calculations, 
and you are charging me more to do an energy model?  Why can't you get 
the loads from the energy model?"

And I always have to say something like "A loads calc model with 
sufficient detail to get the room by room loads we need for design is 
way too detailed for an energy model.  If we use a load calcs model for 
energy calcs, the progress would be too slow and the answers would not 
be more accurate."  And this I know from experience.

It would be nice to enter room by room information and have it spit out 
load data for sizing equipment and air flows, but use some different way 
of zoning for the energy calcs.  Maybe a way to identify rooms with 
similar load profiles that would be considered a single room for the 
purposes of the energy calculations.  Then of course, have a report for 
design loads and equipment sizing.

Sounds hard to me, but hey, you asked...

In my opinion, since Randall got me thinking.... (and not completely on the topic of execution speed)
Most modeling effort in much of the world appears to be spent currently on new building models.  I expect and hope that this will change and the focus will change to existing building performance.  These, however, are VERY different activities!

For energy models of new or not-yet-built buildings:

1.       The most effort is spent on input preparation and output review.

a.        Input preparation will be faster for models imported from IFC-compliant BIM tools once that's a common feature for GUIs like DesignBuilder, Simergy and OpenStudio

b.      I suspect that almost all new buildings will use BIM within the next few years, so that part of the problem may disappear.

2.       Output review is another matter.  I cannot quite imagine how modelers who do not have detailed reporting of individual nodes and energy at each timestep can conduct quality checking.  EnergyPlus has this capability, I use it on every project and would (probably) never consider doing otherwise.  Nonetheless, I think that the creation of all those variables may consume some processing time.  Perhaps that can be improved?

a.        A related topic that probably has nothing to do with execution speed is that the detailed output is not very "user friendly".  Formatting is primitive, for one thing, and it's only available in text format.

b.      There are some 3rd party graphical review tools, but they seem limited to review of a single variable at a time.  I am probably going to try using Universal Translator (www.utonline.org<http://www.utonline.org>) for this purpose shortly.  It's main purpose in life is analyzing data logger files, but that's not too different than reviewing an energy model's output.  Has anyone got a great, multi-variable solution for output review?

3.       I have mentioned in the past on this forum that if you prepare input carefully, and manage run times properly, execution time is not critically  important. (e.g., run only Design Days until output looks believable, add complex systems after checking simpler systems, etc.)
I  won't ever complain about faster execution time (!), but since Geof has been asked to make it a lot faster, I'm wondering for whom the execution time has been a problem?

For existing buildings that have utility consumption data, the same basic problems present themselves in a very different fashion:

1.       Input preparation cannot be imported from BIM. It may need to be hand-created by field investigation because there are no drawings whatsoever.

a.       The requirements for precise representation of geometry are not the same.  Every tiny reveal or dormer need not be described for the model.  Every construction detail and material is not always known.  Glass emissivity and filler gas are also not known.  This means the geometry and, to some extent, materials can be simplified - perhaps greatly.  They normally do not affect the model significantly, especially when compared to all the other variables.

b.      All of the schedules, diversity patterns and control settings still need to be part of the input, however, and these are very time-consuming to develop.  There is software now available ( e.g., www.retroficiency.com<http://www.retroficiency.com>) which analyzes utility data and infers a lot of useful information.  This is especially powerful if your site has an interval meter (records usage hourly or more frequently).  "Infer" is not the same as "know", but it is extremely difficult to get reliable data about building operation, even from people who work at the building!  Check out the cool chart of interval data that I've attached and tell me when the people arrive and leave each day :).  A Building Management System, properly used, can also help a lot, but too few of those are taken full advantage of.

c.       In short, input preparation is a big job, but is probably one for a GUI, not the calculation engine.

2.       Output review, assuming that you correctly define the energy systems, has a new and different focus.  Not only must the model correctly define the actual energy systems, but it must result in the same energy use and energy use pattern as the energy meters.

a.       For starters, I am convinced that you must use the actual weather which occurred for the meter billing period.  A quick comparison recently suggests that 10-20% of energy use can be affected by using actual vs. TMY weather data. Why live with that uncertainty?

b.      I am also convinced that it is well worthwhile to measure key energy consumers so as to eliminate more uncertainty.  You'll never know exactly what the infiltration rate is, but it's easy to measure major fan and pump power, for example.

c.       That leaves only a 100-500 or so remaining variables to tweak in order to get a good match between model-predicted and meter-measured energy!  "A good match" includes high correlation (at least) for monthly energy in addition to annual energy.  This is not a trivial effort.

d.      Assuming that you understand which variables will affect the "match" problem positively, THIS is where execution speed is a VERY BIG DEAL.  Easily, you may have dozens (or hundreds) of full year simulations until you get a "good match".

e.      Because existing building energy models have so many unknowns, it seems to be the case that less calculation rigor is needed.  Why spend the time to model a complete energy balance every 15 minutes when you are guessing about the schedule last Spring, the room setpoints, the COP of the 20 year old chiller and the condition of the poorly maintained steam traps?  Once again, there are lights on the software horizon (Retroficiency is one, but there are others) which are attempting to use simplified models.  These may be all that's needed, but it's early in their development and the "votes" are not all counted.

That's all for now.  Can you tell that I think the future of energy modeling is in existing buildings?  I am certain that some of you are far ahead of me in that area, but I hear very little about it in my corner of the USA.  I'd love to hear more!

Jim:

I agree with your sentiment that modeling of potential retrofits to existing buildings demands of an analyst somewhat of a different skillset than that required for modeling new construction. This is because, in my opinion, most existing buildings contain operable systems are in some way 'broken' (i.e. malfunctioning control systems, poorly balanced energy distribution systems, unintended simultaneous heating and cooling, etc., etc.).  An analyst/modeler wanting to represent these defects needs a  firm grasp of how older analogue equipment and controls (lighting, HVAC, service water) are supposed to operate before one can judge how a system is actually operating.  This is not so much of a concern in modeling for new construction, as we assume equipment will be installed, commissioned, etc. to operate much closer to the ideal conditions that quasi-steady state simulations impose.

Furthermore, for modeling existing 'out of control' systems in buildings (only with the intent of seeing the ROI for improving them), one also needs a firm grasp of how to 'trick' the particular simulation engine into abstracting the energy consumption effects of the particular defect. For example, in eQUEST, one way to 'model' zero benefit simultaneous heating and cooling loads is to develop custom schedule driven process loads to 'hang' from the appropriate fluid loop. While possible, this is harder than it should be to do and fraught with error. I think our community would benefit if standardized methods for common 'retro-commissioning' measures could be developed and adopted, and that then tool vendors could then incorporate interfaces to accomplish the methods.

The good news is that data acquisition costs for supporting these sorts of 'pre-processed' simulation calculations continues to get cheaper and easier.  I'd love to hear from others in the forum on, (for creating accurate models of existing buildings, and when a building does not have a EMCS capable of trend configuration), what types of data acquisition hardware are people having success with? For me, the simple stand-alone HOBO U series loggers (temp, humidity, motor status) have provided sufficient short term data to significantly improve model quality.

To address your question in 2b below, I suggest you take a look at (2) different (free) data visualization tools that I am aware of:


1)      DVIEW (stand-alone executable)

2)      Energy Charting and Metrics Tool - ECAM (MS Excel Add-in)

A few comments on each -

DVIEW can produce the types of plots you shared, and much more. It can import a structures csv file, but is limited to viewing 8760 rows of data (put in as many columns as you want). Because of the 8760 limitation, it is not useful at all for sub-hourly simulation results unless the results are sampled to hourly. Having said that, it integrates quite well with eQUEST 'custom' hourly reports, which are quite extensive.

An improved version of ECAM has recently been posted to the web. ECAM, is a much more generic and less restrictive data visualization tool, which works best for analyzing hourly of finer data streams . While it can do many things, I've discovered that one of its strengths for simulation 'true-up' is the flexible creation of 'load profiles' from generic data sets.  Think of dataset1 as measured, real world data, and dataset2 as model output data.  If dataset is driven by an AMY weather file, load profiles for an overlapping period of time (January, weekdays, for example) from both streams should visually match. If not, begin the sleuthing process.. And, more interestingly, with ECAM the two datasets do not need to be at the same frequency.

Let's keep the dialogue moving! I know I am learning.

All the Best,

_Chris

That's all for now.  Can you tell that I think the future of energy modeling is in existing buildings?  I am certain that some of you are far ahead of me in that area, but I hear very little about it in my corner of the USA.  I'd love to hear more!

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] current limitations in building energy modeling and simulation

I'll tell you one.  This happens on every energy modeling project.  The architect says "Why are you charging me to compute load calculations, and you are charging me more to do an energy model?  Why can't you get the loads from the energy model?"

And I always have to say something like "A loads calc model with sufficient detail to get the room by room loads we need for design is way too detailed for an energy model.  If we use a load calcs model for energy calcs, the progress would be too slow and the answers would not be more accurate."  And this I know from experience.

It would be nice to enter room by room information and have it spit out load data for sizing equipment and air flows, but use some different way of zoning for the energy calcs.  Maybe a way to identify rooms with similar load profiles that would be considered a single room for the purposes of the energy calculations.  Then of course, have a report for design loads and equipment sizing.

Sounds hard to me, but hey, you asked...

Hello Community,

Again, I am coming to you for input in my efforts to make EnergyPlus run faster.

As Nathaniel Jones suggested, I would like to consider not just the current bottlenecks in EnergyPlus simulations, which are ran from models generated by designers considering the limitations of the software and its capabilities; I would like to know where you would like to get more detailed, precise or accurate data from a simulation run, but accept lesser data in the interest of getting your job finished in a limited amount of time.

To boil it down, I'll ask my question this way: if you could choose one area in EnergyPlus to speed up, what would it be?  Another way of putting it: where would you like more detail in your models, but you simplify in order to reduce simulation execution time?

Many thanks for your help and Happy New Year --

Dear Colleagues:

It is our pleasure to announce FutureBuild, an international conference and networking event dedicated to the design of the built environment 2030-2050 and beyond. Building on our special issue in Building and Environment in 2012 we want to keep looking into the future, but now with a wider scope. This event will investigate what radical and transformative technologies and ideas might be being employed by that date, with a focus on the whole building, energy systems, communities and occupants. FutureBuild will take place in the city of Bath, United Kingdom, from 4 to 6 September 2013. Our website is now available at www.future-build.net<http://www.future-build.net/>. A call for abstracts is open and can be found on the webpages, with deadline for abstracts: 1 February 2013.
We would be happy to see some solid input from the BLDG-SIM communitiee and encourage you to submit a contribution.

Best regards,

HI All,

With the IBPSA chapter meeting, LBNL modelling workshop, and ASHRAE
conference being held here in Dallas, I think it is a good opportunity for
the area building simulation folks to meet/network during this time and see
if there is any interest in setting up an IBPSA chapter along the lines of
other big cities, where we can have presentations/discussions related to
modelling topics of regional interest.

I would be happy to coordinate a short meeting before/after any of the
above events.

Please email offline if interested.

Thanks

I writing here to know about a certain rumor i?ve heard of LEED AP is
developed a new version to this year?. If so, where it would be
approximately?

This is because i?m actually preparing my GA exam, and I would like to

Hello all,
I wanted to make one clarification to this announcement. We are holding elections for officers and once elected, the officers name the executive board directly. So, individuals don't run for president, vp, treasurer, etc... Sorry for any confusion this may have caused.

Also, some people have asked for information about the winter meeting in Dallas. Details can be found on our website: http://www.ibpsa.us/meetings.shtml

Thanks and I hope to see y'all in Dallas.

Best,

	1651-RP
Message-ID: <50EDDC23.5080602@gard.com>

For ASHRAE research project 1651-RP, we are trying to 
assemble a comprehensive list of energy efficiency measures 
that can be considered for new buildings covered by 90.1 
except for renewables. The project is titled: "Development 
of Maximum Technically Achievable Energy Targets for 
Commercial Buildings  (Ultra Low Energy Use Building Set)". 
Later we will be looking for the combination of measures 
that will result in the lowest  possible energy consumption 
for each building type using EnergyPlus.

Attached is a spreadsheet that describes the 320 energy 
efficiency measures gathered to date along with a report 
describing how the spreadsheet was assembled. The report 
also recommends enhancements to EnergyPlus. After we finish 
compiling the list, we will be choosing a subset of measures 
to simulate.

Your help is requested to add measures that are missing from 
the "EEMs" tab of the spreadsheet. Column A, the name of the 
measure, and Column D, the description, are the most 
important. When you add measures, if possible, please also 
add a web or literature source that describes the measure on 
the  "References" tab. Your input on any other portion of 
the spreadsheet is also welcome.

To learn more about how the list was assembled and the 
meaning of each column, a conference call is scheduled for 
Wednesday January 23 at 11am central. If you are interested 
in attending, please let me know and I will send you the 
connection information.

Please feel free forward this email and attachment to others 
who might be interested but please CC me when you do so I 
can keep track of who has received it.

If you have suggestions, it would be most helpful if you 
replied only to me with a revised version of the spreadsheet 
attached containing additional rows at the bottom of each 
tab with your input.

Please provide input no later than February 20, 2013.

Thank you for your help.

Jason

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Architecture competition
Message-ID: <OF3DD792CE.844F316E-ONC1257AEF.0030FD6E-C1257AEF.00317088@bdab.nu>

I am involved in a project where we will evaluate a number of buildings in 
an architecture competition. It is a prestigious project in a rather cold 
climate with over 150 invited architects from all over the world. The 
project will use BREEAM and the rating level is probably Outstanding. In 
this stage we are not interested in evaluating the technical systems but 
the building itself (shape, orientation, fa?ade, windows, solar shading, 
thermal bridges and room location). 

I now wonder if someone has made something similar and if that is the 
case, what kind of information you required from the architect and how you 
made the evaluation?

I am thinking of asking the architects to present heat loss (through 
windows, fa?ade, ground, roof, openings, airflow and thermal bridges), the 
cooling need due to solar radiation and positive heat from the sun (during 
heating period). We will also ask for daylight autonomy (considering 
glare, control systems and human behavior), daylight factor for 
representative rooms, view to the outside and PPD-index according to ISO 
7730.

We will provide input in form of climate data, inside temperature, 
internal loads, schedules, light levels, internal surface reflectance, clo 
and met. We will probably not specify how the information should be 
determined (calculation method and software) but the method and all 
assumptions must be presented so it is possible to evaluate and compare 
it.

I am also thinking of requiring other key metrics (average U-value, 
Envelope area per Volume and so on) to be able to compare the different 
buildings together with a 3D-model of the building.

Any suggestions are welcome, we want this completion to be as fair and 
correct as possible and help making an excellent building in all aspects.

Sincerely,

Max Tillberg

Message-ID: <CAEB-Yar5-yJoREeqWY4Nb0aFVYJYvCB-sLH1v-mpzBAW+CoVkA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

*From the user's guide, the fan power should be removed from the
standard EER*rating of packaged cooling systems.



A 15-ton packaged rooftop single-zone system having an EER of 8.6 (COP of
2.5) is

specified for a building. The following table gives the design
specifications. How should

this be modeled?

Equipment parameter                               Value

Net Cooling Capacity (Btu/h)                   174,000

Total Packaged Unit Input Power (W)        20,128

EER                                                         8.64

Gross Cooling Cap (ARI conditions)         182,000

The supply fan power is the difference between the gross and the net cooling
capacity.


*So my Query is that Gross Cooling capacity ( ARI Condition ) is same
for all Packaged system of any tonnage ??? Is it standard one or what
???? ........Like i have 1.5 *

*ton of PTAC system, so for 1.5 ton of PTAC system also its gross
cooling capacity is same 182,000????*

Max,
You will need to specify the base HVAC, heating and cooling plants,
efficiency, occupied and unoccupied interior set points and schedules
system so that it is the same for all submissions.  You may also want to
define inputs for economizers, night time pre-cooling, whether natural
ventilation is used, etc.  These again should be the same for all
competitors if the envelope is the only component being considered.
Are you interested in just the most energy efficient envelope that can be
conceived by a architect or a cost effective, practical envelope design for
the local environment (i.e. something that can actually be constructed with
local technologies and skills).  If so, you will need first cost and life
cycle data on the envelope materials, components and assemblies as a factor.
In addition, since shading is an evaluation criteria you will want the
competitors to define very specifically any shading control schemes and how
they were modeled to optimize the use and trade-off between solar heating
and day lighting.

Jason:

I read your message with interest, and started creating new measures, before I realized that you clearly state that this list (and presumably the Title/Purpose/Scope of 1651-RP) is meant to cover measures that apply only to NEW BUILDINGS. In other words - you are not looking for measures that would be appropriate for EXISTING buildings...

Given the sheer amount of existing building square footage in our nation's building stock, and the sheer amount of potential for improvement within the poorer performing actors in this stock, is there any activity that you are aware of where a similar effort as to 1651-RP is being undertaken, yet focused on existing buildings? A few scenarios of the types of measures I am referring to may help describe what I mean..

M1: A 4-pipe VAV AHU with a steam (or hot water) heating coil in series with a cooling coil and where the 2-way modulating coil control valves for either (or both) coils fail to close tightly, either because of actuator/linkage issues and/or valve seat erosion).  Repair/replace damaged control valves/valve assemblies.

M2: A Rooftop VAV AHU where the sequence of operations defines the unit outdoor air dampers to close tightly during unoccupied conditions, but where in reality the dampers fail to close completely due to actuator/linkage issues. Repair/replace damaged damper actuator/linkage.

While these may seem like retro-commissioning issues that we do not need modeling tools to help us understand how to 'fix', it's my belief that incorporating simulation-driven estimates of savings from 'fixing' these measures along with other capital improvement measures into packages of improvements can allow us to create more holistic retrofits in existing buildings that achieve deeper savings while yet providing an attractive overall ROI, and ultimately moving the centroid of energy use intensities in our entire built environment.  I hate to see measures like I describe get 'left behind', and yet want to understand if there is a way I can still contribute.

All the Best,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Help Review Energy Efficiency Measure List for ASHRAE 1651-RP

For ASHRAE research project 1651-RP, we are trying to assemble a comprehensive list of energy efficiency measures that can be considered for new buildings covered by 90.1 except for renewables. The project is titled: "Development of Maximum Technically Achievable Energy Targets for Commercial Buildings  (Ultra Low Energy Use Building Set)".
Later we will be looking for the combination of measures that will result in the lowest  possible energy consumption for each building type using EnergyPlus.

Attached is a spreadsheet that describes the 320 energy efficiency measures gathered to date along with a report describing how the spreadsheet was assembled. The report also recommends enhancements to EnergyPlus. After we finish compiling the list, we will be choosing a subset of measures to simulate.

Your help is requested to add measures that are missing from the "EEMs" tab of the spreadsheet. Column A, the name of the measure, and Column D, the description, are the most important. When you add measures, if possible, please also add a web or literature source that describes the measure on the  "References" tab. Your input on any other portion of the spreadsheet is also welcome.

To learn more about how the list was assembled and the meaning of each column, a conference call is scheduled for Wednesday January 23 at 11am central. If you are interested in attending, please let me know and I will send you the connection information.

Please feel free forward this email and attachment to others who might be interested but please CC me when you do so I can keep track of who has received it.

If you have suggestions, it would be most helpful if you replied only to me with a revised version of the spreadsheet attached containing additional rows at the bottom of each tab with your input.

Please provide input no later than February 20, 2013.

Thank you for your help.

I'm not terribly satisfied with the clarity of terminology in the example provided...

The basic concept is "gross (nominal) cooling energy" - "fan energy input" = "non-fan cooling energy"

Put another way, you can ultimately arrive at a cooling EIR (independent of fan energies) by subtracting the fan kW from the system total kW at ARI conditions.

Trying to present this using capacities instead of kW is only confusing the point they mean to make, as I understand it.

Hope that helps!

Message-ID: <95F0356A0810C44AB56ADD48FA44184101BA7A6A@greengo>

Hi all,

 

I'm modeling a building for a LEED certification (renovation) for a
building in France. 

 

Normally in my baseline and proposed models I put the same infiltration
(n50 = 0.14 ach) for both buildings. Even that this is an unreal case
(since the renovation leads to an improve in the permeability of the
building). 

 

I do that because, first 0.14 is the minimal infiltration allowed by
French regulations, and second because I have never seen in the ASHRAE
documentation about improve infiltration in current buildings. Even if
the improve of the infiltration rate can make me gain a lot of
improvement between baseline and proposed buildings energy
requeriements.

 

Anyone of you have already experience in this specific point? Any
justification is required from the USGBC if I want to change the
infiltration between baseline and proposed buildings?

 

Thanks in advance for any comments/help on this,

 

Regards,
David GARCIA-SANCHEZ

Hi David!

Matching infiltration rates between models is in line with the present LEED requirements and referenced standards.  To my understanding, doing otherwise is not prohibited, but if you wish to differentiate proposed and baseline infiltration rates you will need to furnish an explanation (exceptional calculation) along with the rest of your model documentation to the satisfaction of your LEED EAc1/EAp2 reviewer.

I haven't direct experience submitting such differentiating calculations specifically for LEED review (I hope others can chime in!), but some searching of the term "infiltration" in the onebuilding mailing list archives will lead you to multiple methods/papers/cited sources for different approaches.  I personally reference ASHRAE 2001 Fundamentals to address tightness improvements on a broad level (further explanation/citation in the archives).

Since you mentioned "renovation," I would be extra cautious to review the most current LEED guidance available regarding where and to what extent you apply any such "leakage improvement" factors to infiltration rates - there may be unintended effects on what is expected for the modeled constructions (baseline vs. actual).

Best of luck!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] About infiltration in a LEED analysis.....

Hi all,

I'm modeling a building for a LEED certification (renovation) for a building in France.

Normally in my baseline and proposed models I put the same infiltration (n50 = 0.14 ach) for both buildings. Even that this is an unreal case (since the renovation leads to an improve in the permeability of the building).

I do that because, first 0.14 is the minimal infiltration allowed by French regulations, and second because I have never seen in the ASHRAE documentation about improve infiltration in current buildings. Even if the improve of the infiltration rate can make me gain a lot of improvement between baseline and proposed buildings energy requeriements.

Anyone of you have already experience in this specific point? Any justification is required from the USGBC if I want to change the infiltration between baseline and proposed buildings?

Thanks in advance for any comments/help on this,

Regards,
David GARCIA-SANCHEZ

What do you mean by binned weather data?  Like what was in the Air Force Engineering 
Weather Data manual from 1978?   You might check ASHRAE's Weather Data Viewer that can 
produce binned temperature data for over 5,000 locations around the world.  It's not free, 
though, costs $119.

Jason,

Thanks for the information.  You mean I can now throw out the old copy of the blue AF 
manual that I've been keeping for all these years?
I haven't checked out this new revision, but I would like to point out that the blurb on 
the Web says that there are 800 worldwide locations
in the manual, whereas the ASHRAE Weather Data Viewer contains over 5,600.  On a cost per 
station basis, the two are exactly the same
($17/800 == $119/5600 = 2.1 cents per station)  :-) :-)

Here's some food for thought (and sorry to hijack this thread):

I was at an AEE meeting yesterday that included a discussion by a local
meteorologist about the increased variability and extremes that are being
predicted in weather models for the future (i.e. climate change).  

What is the feeling in the bldg-sim community as to how useful 1973-1996
binned average data will continue to be when it comes to predicting building
operation, loads, and performance in a future that is expected to be more
variable and extreme with regards to weather?

Is anyone preparing a new set of TMY data with more extremes?  Are design
day criteria being updated from the historical ASHRAE 1% values?  Will 95
drybulb/78 wetbulb (for Boston anyway) no longer be the standard?

Just wondering if our current methods of building simulation (and design)
may leave something to be desired. 


Sincerely,
Alec Stevens

Or you can easily make your own bin data using TMY3 data files and MS Excel's Histogram function. Works like a charm and the cost is right :) and you can set the bins to match whatever bin size you want. Use some Pivot Table functionality and you can cut those bins down to only occuppied hours etc.

Apparently there are weather trends for, say, the most recent 10 years which are different than the 30 years looked at by a TMY file.  I suspect this could be due to urban heat patterns as well as the general rise in global temperatures.  I don't know if these are significantly different than what a TMY or the AFM 88 blue manual might show.
If you want to investigate, I'm pretty sure that Weather Analytics has a data set offering of actual weather data for 10 years for thousands of locations.  They offer file formats for various of the energy modeling platforms, but also have a .CSV format that could be "binned".

Depending on how much custom binning you are looking to do, Rohini, DView
is one option for data visualization for various time scales, etc.

True they are 30 years worth of data (a tad longer than 10 years) points with the extremes thrown out but you are using binned data. How accurate of a calculation are you really getting anyway? If one were using bin data I would suggest that throughing out the extremes would be warranted.

The problem with TMY files is that they only have 8760 observations. You should use at least 10 years of actual hourly air temperatures to get a good sample, particularly the extremes.

Or you can easily make your own bin data using TMY3 data files and MS Excel's Histogram function. Works like a charm and the cost is right :) and you can set the bins to match whatever bin size you want. Use some Pivot Table functionality and you can cut those bins down to only occuppied hours etc.

Hi Robert!

If you mean scheduling for lighting and/or occupancy, 90.1 does not strictly require anything.  You can use whatever makes sense for the building so long as you are matching between baseline and proposed.

That said, if you are uncomfortable developing your own scheduling and/or are looking for guidance, ASHRAE has published out schedules of this nature that the 90.1 User's manual references.  They are a series of tables from 90.1-1989 for different building occupancy types (School/Warehouse/etc).  None of these building types is "4-story dorm," but you could likely reference "Hotel" and/or "health/institutional."  If you don't have 90.1-1989 handy on your shelves, I know these schedules are freely available incorporated as part of the Washington State Energy Code (2009), and possibly other places.

It's probably worth mentioning the mechanical designer (where applicable) is probably the most defensible source for any project-specific scheduling.  I don't always feel it's a requirement, but getting the mechanical designer's input in writing for any scheduling you're unsure of is always a safe bet.

It's also worth mentioning the schedules generated in a weighted occupancy fashion by eQuest (which I think you're referencing) have in my experience gone largely unchallenged over many LEED projects.  The results are often quite reasonable when you do not have anything more specific to reference.  If I recall correctly some time ago, discussions across one of these mailing lists revealed the schedules "under the hood" used for each occupancy type are in fact referencing ASHRAE-based sources/research.

Does anybody know off the top what the ASHRAE 90.1 Lighting Occupancy is for High/Mid (four story) Residential Apartment/Dorm (private baths)??????

I'm using "Building Area Multi-Family" now, but I'm not sure that's right, and I can't find anything better.

Hoping for a better answer....

Chris,



Great observation!



I come at it from a slightly different perspective:

What are the commonalities and differences between measures for new construction vs. retrofit vs. RCx and optimization?



Even in new construction there is significant potential impact from properly designed, programmed and optimized controls (Cx). And in retrofit there is opportunity for capital replacement that could be viewed as `new' construction.



With respect to RCx, new construction design and Cx, the ability to simulate `sloppy' or broken controls is seriously lacking. Especially within whole building tools that can also capture the enormity of potential interactions. We do it with bin analysis and load profiles built from `experience' simulation tools (Equest)  or actual performance data (using inverse methods) . Absent real data (as in new construction) a simulation tool, based on fundamental analysis, is the next best way to create such profiles. But unless the analysis is integral to the simulation, capturing the interactions that may, or may not matter, is difficult, if not impossible.



Can we get there?    What do you think?

Jason:



I read your message with interest, and started creating new measures, before I realized that you clearly state that this list (and presumably the Title/Purpose/Scope of 1651-RP) is meant to cover measures that apply only to NEW BUILDINGS. In other words - you are not looking for measures that would be appropriate for EXISTING buildings...



Given the sheer amount of existing building square footage in our nation's building stock, and the sheer amount of potential for improvement within the poorer performing actors in this stock, is there any activity that you are aware of where a similar effort as to 1651-RP is being undertaken, yet focused on existing buildings? A few scenarios of the types of measures I am referring to may help describe what I mean..



M1: A 4-pipe VAV AHU with a steam (or hot water) heating coil in series with a cooling coil and where the 2-way modulating coil control valves for either (or both) coils fail to close tightly, either because of actuator/linkage issues and/or valve seat erosion).  Repair/replace damaged control valves/valve assemblies.



M2: A Rooftop VAV AHU where the sequence of operations defines the unit outdoor air dampers to close tightly during unoccupied conditions, but where in reality the dampers fail to close completely due to actuator/linkage issues. Repair/replace damaged damper actuator/linkage.



While these may seem like retro-commissioning issues that we do not need modeling tools to help us understand how to 'fix', it's my belief that incorporating simulation-driven estimates of savings from 'fixing' these measures along with other capital improvement measures into packages of improvements can allow us to create more holistic retrofits in existing buildings that achieve deeper savings while yet providing an attractive overall ROI, and ultimately moving the centroid of energy use intensities in our entire built environment.  I hate to see measures like I describe get 'left behind', and yet want to understand if there is a way I can still contribute.



All the Best,



_Chris

For ASHRAE research project 1651-RP, we are trying to assemble a comprehensive list of energy efficiency measures that can be considered for new buildings covered by 90.1 except for renewables. The project is titled: "Development of Maximum Technically Achievable Energy Targets for Commercial Buildings  (Ultra Low Energy Use Building Set)".

Later we will be looking for the combination of measures that will result in the lowest  possible energy consumption for each building type using EnergyPlus.



Attached is a spreadsheet that describes the 320 energy efficiency measures gathered to date along with a report describing how the spreadsheet was assembled. The report also recommends enhancements to EnergyPlus. After we finish compiling the list, we will be choosing a subset of measures to simulate.



Your help is requested to add measures that are missing from the "EEMs" tab of the spreadsheet. Column A, the name of the measure, and Column D, the description, are the most important. When you add measures, if possible, please also add a web or literature source that describes the measure on the  "References" tab. Your input on any other portion of the spreadsheet is also welcome.



To learn more about how the list was assembled and the meaning of each column, a conference call is scheduled for Wednesday January 23 at 11am central. If you are interested in attending, please let me know and I will send you the connection information.



Please feel free forward this email and attachment to others who might be interested but please CC me when you do so I can keep track of who has received it.



If you have suggestions, it would be most helpful if you replied only to me with a revised version of the spreadsheet attached containing additional rows at the bottom of each tab with your input.



Please provide input no later than February 20, 2013.



Thank you for your help.

Dear Alec and colleagues

There is a niche of research that looks applies the climate change predictions from the meteorologists/climate change experts in building simulation. In the US, the seminal paper in that area has been written by Dru Crawley in the Journal of Building Performance Simulation, and that specific article is open access. DOI:10.1080/19401490802182079. For a wider international perspective, there is the special issue of Building and Environment that I did with David Coley last year (issue 55, 2012).

Here are my two-cents:

I think the idea of calculating design conditions or developing "typical year" weather data
using a long historical record, e.g., the past 30 years, needs to be re-evaluated in light of
global or regional climate change, as well as such irreversible trends as Urban Heat Islands,

Using longer time periods doesn't bring more accuracy in predicting future climate conditions
(after all, aren't we interested in only how buildings do in the future, and not the past?),
but only anchors us more in the past.

About 15 years ago, a meteorologist in ASHRAE TC 4.2 found that you need only 7 years
of data to overcome the stochastic year-to-year variations in the climate.  Therefore, I feel
that it's best to use a shorter time period, more like the last dozen, for these purposes.

That's what I've done for the California Energy Commission in creating the new CZ2010 Title-24
weather files, and what I will be doing to calculate design conditions for the same locations.

There's also been discussion in various places on using GCM (Global Circulation Models) to
calculate future weather and then develop design conditions or "future year" weather files.
I find these  methods too hypothetical for my tastes, and I'm sure those skeptics out there
would have a field day if we were to use them, so my position is to keep doing things the
old way with the actual historical data, but shorten the time periods to something more
immediate.

Last year, I did a study of the savings for window awnings,  where the client asked me to also
do the simulations using the hottest year over the past decade.  The results were quite 
noticeable.
The hottest year (judged by cooling degree-days) for 40% of the 50 US locations I studied were
in the last two years (2010 or 2011).  The cooling loads in many locations increased by 30-40%
(more in the north, less in the south).

Robert,
Nick is right on.
Two more schedule resources for energy models are:
1. The COMNET Commercial Building Energy Modeling Guidelines and Procedures
available online at: http://www.comnet.org/. The schedules in this document
are identical to and taken directly from the ASHRAE 90.1 User's Manual.
2.  The U.S. Department of Energy Commercial Reference Building Models of
the National Building Stock produced by NREL.  They can be obtained from
the following link: http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/46861.pdf.  The
schedules are found in Appendix B of this document and were developed from
resources as far back as 90.1-1989.  The schedules include several extended
building sizes and types not included in 90.1.  The notes say some of the
schedules have been modified based on NREL's research, experience and
judgement.
Finally, I would take the recommendation of Nick one step further and try
to get agreement from the Owner on things like operating and occupancy
schedules in an OPR type of document or something.  Especially if you are
trying to make an estimate of future energy cost/consumption which is not
always a good idea without some kind of disclaimer.
Hope this helps, good luck,
Dennis

I tried 4 times to log on to the meeting.  each time it said "meeting 
has not started yet  please wait"
on the fifth try the message said  "license limit exceeded contact host"
on the 6th try it is back to  Not Started  Yet.........
I just wanted to point out that natural ventilation is like that.........
Sometimes you open the windows and nothing happens, other times you have 
to find the guy with the window crank >>.>.

If the interest is in getting historical time series of weather, there's now plenty of detailed data in the public domain, particularly for the US. For example, NREL has produced the new NSRDB that has the historical weather data 1991-2010 for 1454 US locations.
That's right, 29,000 station-years of detailed hourly data in the TMY3 CSV format. That's not so remarkable once it's realized that to create any typical year weather file one has to first produce the historical time series. It's just now that NREL, bless their hearts, has decided to release publicly what had been internal intermediate data for creating the TMY3 files.

I don't understand the concern about needing to do binning of multiple number of years, and why that would affect the accuracy of a bin program any more than saying we should do hourly simulations with a dozen historical years instead of with a single typical year file. The loss in accuracy must be around a percent or so.

I feel that typical year weather files have been unfairly characterized as bland, misses the extremes, etc. That would be true if the typical months were picked based only on their averages. However, the TMY methodology developed by NREL is much better than that. It picks the month with a frequency distribution closest to the long-term FD. So, it doesn't throw out extremes at all; it just tries to replicate the long-term distribution with the best that can be done using a single-year of record.  

If you compare the 0.4% condition between the historical record and a typical year weather file, you'll find statistical scatter rather than bias.  

In summary, the only conclusion one can make about typical year files is that their frequency distribution is more coarse because they've only got 8760 observations. From the analysis that I've done, I found the biggest effect and concern is with the period of record chosen in their creation. All the other perceived defects, weighting scheme, are quite secondary.

Works like a charm and the cost is right :) and you can set the bins to match whatever bin size you want. Use some Pivot Table functionality and you can cut those bins down to only occuppied hours etc.

This is the first I've heard of NREL having (weather data ?) "around the world in csv file 
format".   Outside of a few selected countries or regions (SWERA, China, India), I was not 
aware that NREL was working on weather files for non-US locations.  Furthermore, their 
international focus has been mainly on estimating solar radiation, not on developing 
weather files per se.  If you know of such data at NREL, please share more information on 
what they are or where the files are available.

I do know that the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) has put a lot of weather data from 
around the world online as the ISH (Integrated Surface Hourly) data base   
http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/isd/index.php

In fact, the new NSRDB (National Solar Radiation Data Base) 1991-2010 that I mentioned 
earlier  is now accessible both at a NREL site

Don't forget to deal with the fan heat as well.

gross cooling capacity - fan heat = net (rated) cooling capacity

 

gross cooling capacity is therefore higher than net capacity, and the
gross EIR will be higher due to both the reduction in electrical  input
(fan input taken out) as well as the higher cooling capacity.

 

Since the fan input energy and heat load are still dealt with, albeit
separately, the net capacity and net EIR are still as expected (rated).

 

I hope this is clear.

 

Best regards,

 

Mike

I'm not terribly satisfied with the clarity of terminology in the
example provided...

 

The basic concept is "gross (nominal) cooling energy" - "fan energy
input" = "non-fan cooling energy"

 

Put another way, you can ultimately arrive at a cooling EIR (independent
of fan energies) by subtracting the fan kW from the system total kW at
ARI conditions.

 

Trying to present this using capacities instead of kW is only confusing
the point they mean to make, as I understand it.

 

Hope that helps!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Gross cooling capacity at ARI conditions

 

Hello All,

 

>From the user's guide, the fan power should be removed from the standard
EER
rating of packaged cooling systems. 
 
 
 
A 15-ton packaged rooftop single-zone system having an EER of 8.6 (COP
of
2.5) is
 
specified for a building. The following table gives the design
specifications. How should
 
this be modeled?
 
Equipment parameter                               Value
 
Net Cooling Capacity (Btu/h)                   174,000
 
Total Packaged Unit Input Power (W)        20,128
 
EER                                                         8.64
 
Gross Cooling Cap (ARI conditions)         182,000
 
The supply fan power is the difference between the gross and the net
cooling
capacity.
 
So my Query is that Gross Cooling capacity ( ARI Condition ) is same for
all Packaged system of any tonnage ??? Is it standard one or what ????
........Like i have 1.5 
 
ton of PTAC system, so for 1.5 ton of PTAC system also its gross cooling
capacity is same 182,000????

ASHRAE Technical Committee 4.2 regularly (every 4 years) updates the design conditions data in the ASHRAE Fundamentals (latest version 2009).



Chapter 14 Climatic Design Information contains all the normal cooling and heating design conditions (1, 2, 99, 99.6) but a lot more.  And the WDView program allows users to look at frequencies, joint frequency matrices, custom bin the data, and calculated degree-days to any base.



A new version of the Fundamentals (2013) is due out this spring with updated period of record (1986-2010) and a new version of the WDView program (5.0).



The design conditions ARE showing the changes in climate due to urbanization and climatic trends.



The soon-to-be-published Chapter 14 says:



" Differences from Previously Published Design Conditions

?         Climatic design conditions in this chapter are generally similar to those in previous editions, because similar if not identical analysis procedures were used. There are some differences, however, owing to a more recent period of record (generally 1986-2010 versus 1982-2006). For example, when compared to the 2009 edition, 99.6% heating dry-bulb temperatures have increased by 0.31?F (0.17?C) on average, and 0.4% cooling dry-bulb temperatures have increased by 0.18?F (0.10?C) on average. Similar trends are observed for other design temperatures. The root mean square differences are 0.74?F (0.41?C) for the 99.6% heating dry-bulb values and 0.70?F (0.39?C) for 0.4% cooling dry-bulb. The increases noted here are generally consistent with the discussion in the section on Impacts of Climate Change.

?         Further details concerning differences between design conditions in the 2009 edition and 2005 edition are described in Thevenard (2009). Differences between the 2005 edition and the 2001 edition are described in Thevenard et al. (2005). Differences between the 1993 and previous editions are described in Colliver et al. (2000)."



  And



"Effects of Climate Change

...

For 1274 observing sites worldwide with suitably complete data from 1977 to 2006, selected design conditions were compared between the period 1977-1986 and 1997-2006. The results, averaged over all locations, are as follows:

?         The 99.6% annual dry-bulb temperature increased 2.74?F (1.52?C)

?         The 0.4% annual dry-bulb increased 1.42?F (0.79?C)

?         Annual dew point increased by 0.99?F (0.55?C)"





As Joe Huang and others have noted, NREL recently updated the NSRDB to contain data through 2010.  The NSRDB (US locations only) was the source for the TMY3 and a project to create TMY4 is planned.  Environment Canada is also updating the CWEC (Canadian locations) to more recent period of record and more locations as well.  The recently released ASHRAE IWEC2 provide another 3,012 locations outside of the US and Canada.



As others have noted, there are also AMYs (actual meteorological years) with records up until the last few months available from different sources now including gridded data to 1 kM.



It's a lot better than where we were before 2005 with TMY2 (only 239 US locations) and CWEC (originally 55 and now 80 locations)!

Here's some food for thought (and sorry to hijack this thread):



I was at an AEE meeting yesterday that included a discussion by a local meteorologist about the increased variability and extremes that are being predicted in weather models for the future (i.e. climate change).



What is the feeling in the bldg-sim community as to how useful 1973-1996 binned average data will continue to be when it comes to predicting building operation, loads, and performance in a future that is expected to be more variable and extreme with regards to weather?



Is anyone preparing a new set of TMY data with more extremes?  Are design day criteria being updated from the historical ASHRAE 1% values?  Will 95

drybulb/78 wetbulb (for Boston anyway) no longer be the standard?



Just wondering if our current methods of building simulation (and design) may leave something to be desired.





Sincerely,

Alec Stevens

I agree with Joe's assessment here on the length of time for a TMY file. 
Since we construct TMY files on demand, we are actually thinking about 
making the number of years a user selectable variable..."Build from the last 
___ years of data".  Would that be useful?

Here are my two-cents:

I think the idea of calculating design conditions or developing "typical 
year" weather data
using a long historical record, e.g., the past 30 years, needs to be 
re-evaluated in light of
global or regional climate change, as well as such irreversible trends as 
Urban Heat Islands,

Using longer time periods doesn't bring more accuracy in predicting future 
climate conditions
(after all, aren't we interested in only how buildings do in the future, and 
not the past?),
but only anchors us more in the past.

About 15 years ago, a meteorologist in ASHRAE TC 4.2 found that you need 
only 7 years
of data to overcome the stochastic year-to-year variations in the climate. 
Therefore, I feel
that it's best to use a shorter time period, more like the last dozen, for 
these purposes.

That's what I've done for the California Energy Commission in creating the 
new CZ2010 Title-24
weather files, and what I will be doing to calculate design conditions for 
the same locations.

There's also been discussion in various places on using GCM (Global 
Circulation Models) to
calculate future weather and then develop design conditions or "future year" 
weather files.
I find these  methods too hypothetical for my tastes, and I'm sure those 
skeptics out there
would have a field day if we were to use them, so my position is to keep 
doing things the
old way with the actual historical data, but shorten the time periods to 
something more
immediate.

Last year, I did a study of the savings for window awnings,  where the 
client asked me to also
do the simulations using the hottest year over the past decade.  The results 
were quite
noticeable.
The hottest year (judged by cooling degree-days) for 40% of the 50 US 
locations I studied were
in the last two years (2010 or 2011).  The cooling loads in many locations 
increased by 30-40%
(more in the north, less in the south).

We have some good discussion at the NY IBPSA meeting last night about TMY
vs. AMY weather data, and looking at both on projects even though AMY data
is not common in U.S. standards / rating systems.

Any thoughts here? Do others run concurrent simulations using AMY data?

Since ASHRAE is already adjusting design day information (see Dru Crawley's post earlier today), I think the best use for AMY data in our industry will be an energy model of an existing building for which you want to match actual vs predicted energy use.  Using the actual weather eliminates a significant unknown and allows you to focus on the other uncertainties as you calibrate the model.

Is anyone preparing a new set of TMY data with more extremes?  Are design

drybulb/78 wetbulb (for Boston anyway) no longer be the standard?

Just wondering if our current methods of building simulation (and design)
may leave something to be desired.

You might check ASHRAE's Weather Data Viewer that can produce binned
temperature data for over 5,000 locations around the world.  It's not
free, though, costs $119.

I'm personally a big proponent for modeling location-specific AMY weather whenever there is calibration to historical data to consider, but that certainly doesn't apply to every model or standard.  I don't consider AMY/TMY to be an either-or proposition as much as it makes sense to use either as appropriate to the analysis at-hand.

I have myself used both kinds of weather files with the same model, to different ends.  If you are trying to make long-term ROI decisions, averaged weather data is absolutely preferable to AMY as you don't want to over- or under-account for the weather extremes that occur over any given period in isolation.  If you are calibrating an existing building to past utility bills and measurements, that calibration can be performed with much more certainty using AMY.

As to using 30+ years of averaged data vs. a smaller averaged set of more recent data for TMY, taking any position on the matter seems like "timing the market" on some level to me...  I'm very curious to hear the opinions of the weather scientists and researchers more informed than myself.  I wonder (out loud) whether we should consider the anticipated lifespan of the building and how long the owner will be paying the utility bills in making such a decision on a per-project basis?  Perhaps a school district occupying the same building for many decades is better served making decisions with a more conservative set of averaged weather data (not necessarily "shorter," but with amplified extremes)?

So far as LEED/standards like the 90.1 performance rating method are concerned, I think TMY remains preferable to AMY to avoid "cherry picking" a year which would benefit the demonstrated performance.  I don't think the duration of years involved in the TMY data should at least have some minimum (if that's not spelled out somewhere already), if not an explicitly required number of years, for the same reasons.

We have some good discussion at the NY IBPSA meeting last night about TMY vs. AMY weather data, and looking at both on projects even though AMY data is not common in U.S. standards / rating systems.

Any thoughts here? Do others run concurrent simulations using AMY data?

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Binned weather data for US (not the equest weather file)

Here are my two-cents:

I think the idea of calculating design conditions or developing "typical year" weather data
using a long historical record, e.g., the past 30 years, needs to be re-evaluated in light of
global or regional climate change, as well as such irreversible trends as Urban Heat Islands,

Using longer time periods doesn't bring more accuracy in predicting future climate conditions
(after all, aren't we interested in only how buildings do in the future, and not the past?),
but only anchors us more in the past.

About 15 years ago, a meteorologist in ASHRAE TC 4.2 found that you need only 7 years
of data to overcome the stochastic year-to-year variations in the climate. Therefore, I feel
that it's best to use a shorter time period, more like the last dozen, for these purposes.

That's what I've done for the California Energy Commission in creating the new CZ2010 Title-24
weather files, and what I will be doing to calculate design conditions for the same locations.

There's also been discussion in various places on using GCM (Global Circulation Models) to
calculate future weather and then develop design conditions or "future year" weather files.
I find these  methods too hypothetical for my tastes, and I'm sure those skeptics out there
would have a field day if we were to use them, so my position is to keep doing things the
old way with the actual historical data, but shorten the time periods to something more
immediate.

Last year, I did a study of the savings for window awnings,  where the client asked me to also
do the simulations using the hottest year over the past decade.  The results were quite
noticeable.
The hottest year (judged by cooling degree-days) for 40% of the 50 US locations I studied were
in the last two years (2010 or 2011).  The cooling loads in many locations increased by 30-40%
(more in the north, less in the south).

I would like to clarify that ASHRAE TC 4.2 has not adjusted the design 
day information in the HOF.  What Dru meant I think is that global 
climate change and urban heat island effects are being seen the design 
day information as the tables are being periodically updated every 3-4 
years.  There has been no change in the design day calculation procedure 
that's related to capturing more recent results or projecting trends 
into the future.  The closest that TC 4.2 have come is to list the trend 
for each station over recent years.

Hey Rohini,

Why not download the weather files and bin them yourself using Excel. It's
free and it's not rocket science (hint: COUNTIFS will do the trick)

Check NREL's website if you want TMY3 data (either search for a single
location or download all of all stations - 228 MB - 2GB when extracted)
http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/1991-2005/tmy3/

The list of stations is in TMY3_StationsMeta.csv


And if you need daily temperature for example, check NOAA's website (also
free)

Best,
Julien

> 1651-RP
>
> For ASHRAE research project 1651-RP, we are trying to assemble a
> comprehensive list of energy efficiency measures that can be considered for
> new buildings covered by 90.1 except for renewables. The project is titled:
> "Development of Maximum Technically Achievable Energy Targets for
> Commercial Buildings  (Ultra Low Energy Use Building Set)".
> Later we will be looking for the combination of measures that will result
> in the lowest  possible energy consumption for each building type using
> EnergyPlus.
>
> Attached is a spreadsheet that describes the 320 energy efficiency
> measures gathered to date along with a report describing how the
> spreadsheet was assembled. The report also recommends enhancements to
> EnergyPlus. After we finish compiling the list, we will be choosing a
> subset of measures to simulate.
>
> Your help is requested to add measures that are missing from the "EEMs"
> tab of the spreadsheet. Column A, the name of the measure, and Column D,
> the description, are the most important. When you add measures, if
> possible, please also add a web or literature source that describes the
> measure on the  "References" tab. Your input on any other portion of the
> spreadsheet is also welcome.
>
> To learn more about how the list was assembled and the meaning of each
> column, a conference call is scheduled for Wednesday January 23 at 11am
> central. If you are interested in attending, please let me know and I will
> send you the connection information.
>
> Please feel free forward this email and attachment to others who might be
> interested but please CC me when you do so I can keep track of who has
> received it.
>
> If you have suggestions, it would be most helpful if you replied only to
> me with a revised version of the spreadsheet attached containing additional
> rows at the bottom of each tab with your input.
>
> Please provide input no later than February 20, 2013.

Message-ID: <50F079A1.6070002@whiteboxtechnologies.com>

The topic of using actual year versus typical year weather data (please 
note my rant about nomenclature at the end of my post below, with 
apologies to Steve Cornick :-) ) was discussed last October, so maybe we 
need to create a FAQ on this topic ?   which reminds me that ASHRAE TC 
4.2 has a FAQ about various types of weather data and their appropriate 
use ( see http://tc42.ashraetcs.org/faq.html#6 ).  To me, the 
distinction is obvious - if you're evaluating actual building 
performance, use the actual year weather file; if you're evaluating 
hypothetical building performance (as for standards compliance or LEED 
rating), use a typical year weather file.

This topic is separate from the one about the best method to create a 
typical year or calculate design conditions.   This is as much an 
engineering question as a meteorological one, so I'm afraid the insight 
you will get from climatologists will be limited.  When I worked with 
meteorologists in several countries, esp. in the US and China, I was 
struck that the concept of a "design day" or a "typical year" was 
something outside their experience.

I agree that using an actual year weather file to evaluate a building's 
performance is "cherry picking" the data, but is anyone really doing 
that?  Wasn't that why typical year weather files were developed in the 
first place more than 30 years ago?  My interest in seeing the time 
period for developing typical years or calculating design conditions 
reduced from 30 years is because I think the results would then respond 
better to ongoing trends instead of lagging by a decade or more.  It 
would be an easy hypothesis to test and I'm thinking of doing that for a 
selected number of US stations, i.e., create typical years of different 
time periods and see which time period best matched the results for the 
following X number of years.  As for the minimum acceptable number of 
years to create a typical year, that's been implicitly decided by ASHRAE 
TC 4.2 and NREL as either 7 or 8 years.

The idea of a more conservative set of averaged weather data seems 
problematic to me.  It's hard to define what's conservative because it 
would depend on the building as well as the climate, and any effort to 
massage real data would open up a whole can of worms.  You would be much 
better off to simply run the building over the past so many historical 
years, and pick the year with the highest energy consumption to do your 
projection.

Joe

my rant on weather nomenclature (as promised earlier):  I prefer saying 
"typical year"  when talking about the general concept, and use TMY only 
when referring specifically to the TMYX data sets or methodology 
developed by NREL.  I find using TMY as a general term confusing and not 
fair to all the other typical year data sets, such as TRY,  WYEC, IWEC, 
CZXXRV, DRY, etc.  I also find the term AMY odd, as if real weather data 
needed to be branded  (rant over).

Chris,

The focus of the 1651-RP research project is just on new 
building construction but I think it would be great if a 
similar project on existing buildings was started. I 
certainly welcome your input on new construction measures.

Perhaps you can start a similar spreadsheet for existing 
building measures, I think others on BLDG-SIM might find it 
valuable.

Jason, it would be interesting to have an ECM list tied to the type of
"Design Guidelines" algorithm developed for passive design measures by the
Energy Design Tools team at UCLA (copied), having an ability to filter ECMs
using project parameters.

 Techniques for Natural Ventilation and Thermal Comfort Prediction
Message-ID: <1B23446CBF250648A2FC775DE3FE7E800FC2686D@OC11expo28.exchange.mit.edu>

Dear colleagues and friends in the Boston area:

The Building Technology Program at MIT and IBPSA Boston are pleased to announce a presentation by Professor Malcolm Cook (Loughborough University) on January 31st at  noon EST in the Long Lounge (building 7 room 431) at MIT (http://whereis.mit.edu/). Everyone is welcome.

Christoph


Low Energy Buildings: CFD Techniques for Natural Ventilation and Thermal Comfort Prediction
Malcolm's presentation will cover both his research and consultancy activities. This will cover the work he has undertaken during his time spent working with architects on low energy building design, with a particular focus on natural ventilation and passive cooling strategies, and the role computer simulation can play in this design process. Malcolm will talk about the simulation techniques employed, as well as the innovative passive design principles that have led to some of the UK's most energy efficient buildings. In addition to UK building projects, the talk but will include work Malcolm completed as part of the design of the LEED Gold award winning Harm A. Weber Academic Center at Judson University, in Elgin, near Chicago. This building, which comprises office and library space, employs a hybrid ventilation and cooling strategy which exploits the maximum benefit from natural ventilation before reverting to air-conditioning during the harsh winter and peak summer months. Malcolm will also talk about recent research projects, including his work on Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of unsteady flows in naturally ventilated buildings and the development of a new simulation system which couples CFD with a model of human physiology and thermal comfort.

About the speaker:

Malcolm Cook is Professor of Building Performance Analysis at Loughborough University. He is based in the Building Energy Research Group in the School of Civil and Building Engineering and leads their work in the area of ventilation modeling and low energy building design. He obtained his first degree from Manchester University (UK) in Mathematics and completed his PhD in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling of buoyancy-driven natural ventilation at De Montfort University (Leicester, UK). He has worked on research projects funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, the Department of Health and the European Union. He has completed many consultancy projects for a wide range of clients worldwide which have included design and simulation work for health care buildings, schools and modern library buildings. His work is published in over 70 refereed conference and journal papers and has contributed to awards for innovative building design, including the RIBA presidents gold medal for practice-based architecture (2007), the CIBSE environmental initiative of the year award (2006) and a LEED Gold rated Academic Center for Judson College, IL (2008). Malcolm is a member of the CIBSE Natural Ventilation group, vice-chairman of the CIBSE Building Simulation group and chairman of the England affiliate of the International Building Performance Simulation Association.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Interpretation in AHU for baseline and proposed model in
	LEED.
Message-ID: <95F0356A0810C44AB56ADD48FA44184101BF224B@greengo>

Hi all !

 

I have a tricky question concerning Modeling in LEED that I'm quite sure
is a common problem concerning the interpretation of LEED baseline
systems definitions. In the paragraph 6.5.6.1 of ASHRAE 90.1-2007. The
requirements of use a heat recovering in the baseline system are stated.
Normally we should not overpass 2 400 l/s in flow rate and 70% of
outside air intake. If we have both statements in our systems the
baseline system must not include heat recover. (and since baseline is
the building that we are comparing our proposed systems the gap between
baseline and proposed are wider).

 

In the building which I'm modeled I have the AHU divided by north system
and south system (both AHU's serve offices in all floors). One of the
AHU meets the requirements to avoid air recovering in the baseline
system, the other doesn't.

 

Since AHU's of baseline systems are supposed to be modeled by floor I
should take heat recover or not?

 

For me what I should do is to "merge" both air requirements of both
proposed Air handle units and make a ratio by floor, so I can see which
floor of my proposed systems meet the requirements and which not... is
this correct?

 

Thanks of any advice on this.

 

Regards,


David GARCIA-SANCHEZ

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Internal mass modeling guidance in E+?
Message-ID: <CAETHmJ7e3eDegj87de_6BcqFK378YoYmF83xE4ahYZ55WFv5gA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear colleagues,

I'm looking into furniture/internal mass modeling in energy models
particularly within the environment of EnergyPlus but also not limited to
that.

I have two questions I guess:

1, Are there any modeling guide or reference building report that may give
recommendations/instructions on how to represent furniture/internal mass
inside a building if there is no much detailed information? I guess all I'm
asking is are there any published data-set, or default values in terms of
material property and area to represent furniture like what could be easily
found about schedules and occupancy density?

COMNET modeling guide has only one paragraph about it and it mentioned "The
interior thermal mass and modeling assumptions in the baseline building
shall be the same as the proposed design."
Currently what I have is from Building America House Simulation Protocols:
"The internal mass of furniture and contents shall be equal to 8 lb/ft2 of
conditioned floor space. For solar distribution purposes, lightweight
furniture covering 40% of the floor area shall be assumed."

2, DOE reference commercial buildings have internal mass objects in the
idf. file, where does the information come from?

Appreciate your input!

Best,

Qinpeng

Although we would like to have all building inputs to be well-documented, this is still 
far in the future, especially for those inputs having to do with lifestyle and behavior.  
On internal mass, the proverbial story is to call a moving company and ask how much stuff 
do they haul in a typical move.  I actually had a researcher do that 20 years ago, and she 
came up with a number of 5.5 lbs/ft2  for a residential building.  I see that the Building 
America has upped that to 8 lbs/ft2.  I have no grounds to either believe or disbelieve that.

I've heard even less discussion on the internal mass of commercial buildings.  As the 
original developer of the DOE Reference Buildings, I can say that all those inputs for 
internal conditions (mass, shading, occupancy schedules, etc.) are based on "engineering 
judgment" (at least in my original work)

It's not particularly difficult to survey an appropriate number of houses/buildings and 
come up with something more defensible, but sad to say, nobody wants to support that 
because it's not regarded as serious research.  About 20 years ago, a colleague at FSEC 
and I came up with a Work Statement for ASHRAE TC 4.7 to survey a collection of homes and 
develop prototypical operating conditions.  It got approved but just at the verge of going 
out for bid, ASHRAE Research decided to withdraw it.

I believe that E+ and predecessors take/took what ever was described
as "internal mass" and parsed it into an equivalent "partition" of
some "equivalent"  area. This can lead to some counter intuitive
results. Most might expect that "internal" or "thermal" mass is going
to moderate energy transfer ("store"). But suppose I describe a
banquet hall full of folding mdf or plywood tables (light weight).
Compared to an empty room, the area available to absorb radiation and
convect it to the room is increased by easily 1/3. All of a sudden the
room is "fast" and energy gains are translated into cooling loads much
more quickly.

So let's agree with Joe that your question can be answered by "walking
around." In looking around my office I find that one partition is
covered with book cases and that the other side of the partition is
also covered with books. If I thought this was an important feature
that needed to be modeled (which I don't and which isn't) I would not
describe any internal equivalent mass, I would simply describe a
partition made up of books-air space-gyp board wall-air space-books.

But why do I think this is irrelevant additional work? I can weigh
some books to determine their density. We think books are heavy but
imagine putting an equivalent volume of concrete in your backpack.
Then they are not so "thermally massey". Also the books never receive
direct sunlight and the temperature in my office varies little because
it is in my heavily insulated, air tight home. Since the guzinta
equals the guzouta over time and since the guzinta and guzouta, even
for this massive double book lined partition, are near zero because
the materials are at constant temperature, more or less, the mass of
the books is not very important to the room energy balance.

I don't know what thermal mass is anyway. The term must have evolved
partly from passive solar designs, where energy storing materials
exposed to the sun are important,  and from the brick trade
association who left a confusing legacy of claims that a masonry house
had a higher R-value because of the "thermal mass." Mind you I think
bricks are great, I have some myself. However, there is nothing in the
definition of R-value that is labeled "brick."

My apologies Dr. Wang. I expect that what I have just said is more or
less useless as an answer to you questions. However, a productive
guide to a first approach might be found in:

Consider a Spherical Cow: A Course in Environmental Problem Solving, John Harte

It is easier to bound a problem than to defend anybody's guess at the
mean. The correct answer always seems to be "It Depends."

There's also an issue here about whether or not there's any modeling of
internal partitions or fixtures included in your model. My personal
experience in modeling residential models is that they always lag more than
you expect, so I've regularly responded by jacking up the internal mass. I
certainly can fit metered HVAC data a lot better when I add mass beyond
what the BABM suggests. I've guessed that's because my partitions don't
quite match the amount of mass we're interacting with.

I get what Doug is saying that there isn't much temperature change
occurring in his bookshelf, but when you have literally several tons of
exposed mass, even a degree or two of temperature change is quite a bit of
heat. Those granite counters currently in fashion do something for the
building mass.

What's funny about this is that the conventional rule of thumb is that
residential construction is "light" and has little impact from mass, while
commercial buildings are "heavy" and have lots of mass impacts. My personal
experience in studying this is that mass is extremely important in
residential construction because they "float" a lot of the time and also
have higher solar gains than commercial spaces.

One possible area of fruitful research I've thought about is to try and get
some utility direct load control data and look at the "response time" of
residences in terms of how long it took to have the temperature rise a
certain amount when the HVAC system was constrained. You'd at least get
some good data about how responsive the houses are supposed to be and alter
what you can in your models to get them to better match real life (whether
or not you actually figured out the root cause of the problem in the
model).

I've had the same experience when comparing simulation results to measured indoor

substantially more flattened and lagged compared to what the simulation showed.  It may be 
that getting the right number on the amount of internal mass might not necessarily result 
in a house model that responds similar to a real building.  Then you have to decide 
whether to "tune" the model to be physically correct or thermally correct!

Perhaps mass could be related to occupancy quite easily. After all every
person needs a few square feet of desk, possibly some filing.

There is probably quite a simple arithmetic formula that holds true for
most situations, the arguments of which might be:
? occupant density
? desk space per occupant
? material thickness
? extra shelving required?

Ignore anything with less mass.

If you come up with an excel formula, I'd like a copy ;o)

Hi Folks:

This has to do with modeling in general.

I have a Window Film manufacturer with a product called Enerlogic VEP35 window film. It is apparently applied to the inside of a window.

The manufacturer claims that this product lowers the U-Value of single pane glass (1/4" or 6 mm) from 1.109 to 0.6. And with no air space between the film and the glass. "Revolutionary new technology"

Has anyone ever run into this product before? Why does this claim sound "too good to be true" ??

Thanks.

Hi John,

As I understand the topic (at a baser level than others on these lists), R-values / U-values are a kind of flawed metric in and of themselves when discussing window films.  Films can perform magical feats when it comes to cutting solar loads (perhaps turning your building into a 2-way mirror in the process), but quantifying that result into a U-value is a loopy path at best, as no thin/transparent coating prevents heat transfer by conduction in the same sense typical insulation does.

Regardless of manufacturer claims, I would be averse to modeling the effects of such films as a "u-factor factor" if charged with determining ROI.  Also keep in mind solar loads aren't always a bad thing if we're talking annual energy bills.

See also:

Here's a (for cost?) paper that appears to be evaluating this exact sort of issue utilizing eQuest/WINDOW.  Abstract/highlights there are intriguing.  Possibly includes procedure you could draw from?  I recognize Rongxin from the mailing lists here - perhaps he could fill you in further?

I've modeled that film for an office building in wellington, nz. I was
pretty excited but unable to show overall building energy reduction sure to
the film. Need to run a one zone model and see if I can obtain savings in
particular conditions.

That said a 40% better u value is wild. If be excited about 5% over the
year.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Internal mass modeling guidance in E+?
I believe that E+ and predecessors take/took what ever was described
as "internal mass" and parsed it into an equivalent "partition" of
some "equivalent"  area. This can lead to some counter intuitive
results. Most might expect that "internal" or "thermal" mass is going
to moderate energy transfer ("store"). But suppose I describe a
banquet hall full of folding mdf or plywood tables (light weight).
Compared to an empty room, the area available to absorb radiation and
convect it to the room is increased by easily 1/3. All of a sudden the
room is "fast" and energy gains are translated into cooling loads much
more quickly.

So let's agree with Joe that your question can be answered by "walking

covered with book cases and that the other side of the partition is
also covered with books. If I thought this was an important feature
that needed to be modeled (which I don't and which isn't) I would not
describe any internal equivalent mass, I would simply describe a
partition made up of books-air space-gyp board wall-air space-books.

But why do I think this is irrelevant additional work? I can weigh
some books to determine their density. We think books are heavy but
imagine putting an equivalent volume of concrete in your backpack.
Then they are not so "thermally massey". Also the books never receive
direct sunlight and the temperature in my office varies little because
it is in my heavily insulated, air tight home. Since the guzinta
equals the guzouta over time and since the guzinta and guzouta, even
for this massive double book lined partition, are near zero because
the materials are at constant temperature, more or less, the mass of
the books is not very important to the room energy balance.

I don't know what thermal mass is anyway. The term must have evolved
partly from passive solar designs, where energy storing materials
exposed to the sun are important,  and from the brick trade
association who left a confusing legacy of claims that a masonry house
had a higher R-value because of the "thermal mass." Mind you I think
bricks are great, I have some myself. However, there is nothing in the

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Internal mass modeling guidance in E+?
There's also an issue here about whether or not there's any modeling of
internal partitions or fixtures included in your model. My personal
experience in modeling residential models is that they always lag more than
you expect, so I've regularly responded by jacking up the internal mass. I
certainly can fit metered HVAC data a lot better when I add mass beyond
what the BABM suggests. I've guessed that's because my partitions don't
quite match the amount of mass we're interacting with.

I get what Doug is saying that there isn't much temperature change
occurring in his bookshelf, but when you have literally several tons of
exposed mass, even a degree or two of temperature change is quite a bit of
heat. Those granite counters currently in fashion do something for the
building mass.

What's funny about this is that the conventional rule of thumb is that
residential construction is "light" and has little impact from mass, while
commercial buildings are "heavy" and have lots of mass impacts. My personal
experience in studying this is that mass is extremely important in
residential construction because they "float" a lot of the time and also
have higher solar gains than commercial spaces.

One possible area of fruitful research I've thought about is to try and get
some utility direct load control data and look at the "response time" of
residences in terms of how long it took to have the temperature rise a
certain amount when the HVAC system was constrained. You'd at least get
some good data about how responsive the houses are supposed to be and alter
what you can in your models to get them to better match real life (whether
or not you actually figured out the root cause of the problem in the
model).

I've had the same experience when comparing simulation results to measured
indoor temperatures for a typical house in California. The actual house
temperatures were substantially more flattened and lagged compared to what
the simulation showed.  It may be that getting the right number on the
amount of internal mass might not necessarily result in a house model that
responds similar to a real building.  Then you have to decide whether to
"tune" the model to be physically correct or thermally correct!

Perhaps mass could be related to occupancy quite easily. After all every
person needs a few square feet of desk, possibly some filing.

There is probably quite a simple arithmetic formula that holds true for
most situations, the arguments of which might be:
? occupant density
? desk space per occupant
? material thickness
? extra shelving required?

Ignore anything with less mass.

If you come up with an excel formula, I'd like a copy ;o)

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Window Film Product Claims

Hi Folks:

This has to do with modeling in general.

I have a Window Film manufacturer with a product called Enerlogic VEP35
window film. It is apparently applied to the inside of a window.

The manufacturer claims that this product lowers the U-Value of single pane
glass (1/4" or 6 mm) from 1.109 to 0.6. And with no air space between the
film and the glass. "Revolutionary new technology"

Has anyone ever run into this product before? Why does this claim sound
"too good to be true" ??

Thanks.

John Aulbach

Curious,

Here's a link to a video on their website: http://www.enerlogicfilm.com/en/HowDoesItWork.aspx

It sounds like a good product, but bad physics (or at least bad explanation of the physics invoved). Low emissivity really affects radiative heat transfer much more than it does conductive transfer. They need to get this tested by an independent accredited third party if they want to be taken seriously.

Hi John,

As I understand the topic (at a baser level than others on these lists), R-values / U-values are a kind of flawed metric in and of themselves when discussing window films.  Films can perform magical feats when it comes to cutting solar loads (perhaps turning your building into a 2-way mirror in the process), but quantifying that result into a U-value is a loopy path at best, as no thin/transparent coating prevents heat transfer by conduction in the same sense typical insulation does.

Regardless of manufacturer claims, I would be averse to modeling the effects of such films as a "u-factor factor" if charged with determining ROI.  Also keep in mind solar loads aren't always a bad thing if we're talking annual energy bills.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Window Film Product Claims


Hi Folks:

This has to do with modeling in general.

I have a Window Film manufacturer with a product called Enerlogic VEP35 window film. It is apparently applied to the inside of a window.

The manufacturer claims that this product lowers the U-Value of single pane glass (1/4" or 6 mm) from 1.109 to 0.6. And with no air space between the film and the glass. "Revolutionary new technology"

Has anyone ever run into this product before? Why does this claim sound "too good to be true" ??

Thanks.

Curious,

Here's a link to a video on their website: http://www.enerlogicfilm.com/en/HowDoesItWork.aspx

It sounds like a good product, but bad physics (or at least bad explanation of the physics invoved). Low emissivity really affects radiative heat transfer much more than it does conductive transfer. They need to get this tested by an independent accredited third party if they want to be taken seriously.

Hi John,

As I understand the topic (at a baser level than others on these lists), R-values / U-values are a kind of flawed metric in and of themselves when discussing window films.  Films can perform magical feats when it comes to cutting solar loads (perhaps turning your building into a 2-way mirror in the process), but quantifying that result into a U-value is a loopy path at best, as no thin/transparent coating prevents heat transfer by conduction in the same sense typical insulation does.

Regardless of manufacturer claims, I would be averse to modeling the effects of such films as a "u-factor factor" if charged with determining ROI.  Also keep in mind solar loads aren't always a bad thing if we're talking annual energy bills.

Update on Window Film Product:

I DID find the product listed in the NFRC Database. But, as you can see, it only lists one U-Value for each product. Not a Delta U. So I think the product is rated for Shading Coefficient and VT at that particular U-Value.

I also have an email into their Product rating director to confirm my suspicions.

All,

We were looking at weather data files for Sydney Australia,
(Sydney.Airport.947670), and we found that there is a of about an hour for
some of the data in AUS_NSW.Mascot-Sydney.Airport.947670_RMY versus
AUS_NSW.Sydney.947670_IWEC.

Please see the attached jpg. Looking at the direct normal radiation and
radiation-rose you can see that sun-rise and sun-set in RMY file happening
earlier. When combined with solar position calculations based location and
time this makes the sky to appear to be skewed, with more radiation  from
the east. We found a similar pattern in AUS_NSW.Sydney.947680_RMY weather
file.

Which weather file is the one that you suggest us to use for the analysis?

Is there a known difference between the RMY and IEWC standard that would
account for this?

Is it because Sydney is near the eastern edge of its time zone, and the RMY
standard is defined in terms of actual local time rather than ?solar time?
and the IEWC standard were defined in terms of solar time rather than local
time?

Regards,

Mostapha

I took a look at an old atlas and Sydney's near the middle of its time zone. Please keep 
in mind that the solar data in the vast majority of weather files is modeled, i.e., 
calculated from other parameters or satellite imagery, so they're quite dependent on the 
solar angle calculations.  I know that's the case with the IWEC, not positively sure about 
the RMYs, though.

I'm attaching a scratch version of the weather file for Sydney I created for the ASHRAE 
IWEC2 set (file sent in separate e-mail to just Mostapha,  I think I'm allowed to do 
that).  Please look at that for a comparison, and let me (and others) know what you find.  
The file is in text, and the columns are clearly identified.

Message-ID: <CALAw1GQ1gm4WzyL8sJ3uZoJ7VH-a_xFmyE7jOqWWd-ESYG7Anw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I have downloaded the Daysim software and in the DAYSIM Getting Started
manual, there is a reference to the global
material library at
http://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ie/lighting/daylight/daysim/docs/NRC_LightingL
ibrarySetup.exe.
which does not work. Can anyone please send the working link or the very
setup? I will be very thankfull.

Regards,

A very simple way of looking at LEED & energy, which I come back to often for discussions on that level, is to consider a building's performance like a tripod with three important legs:  Lights, Mechanical, and Envelope.  If any of those legs is too short, the tripod falls over.

Building on that analogy, to do 10% better than a LEED baseline, a good starting place is to have at least:
-  10% better lighting (10% lower LPD), 
-  10% better HVAC & hot water heating (10% better efficiencies), and 
-  10% better envelope (10% more insulation in walls/roof, 10% better windows).  
For each of these, you can source the baseline/prescriptive levels from the standard of your choosing.

Overperforming in one area can sometimes make up for underperfomance in another, but with diminishing returns.  Amazing HVAC equipment/design has a harder time shining when you have a poor envelope and/or the lighting designer treats LPD's as a "budget" they have to use up.  For such reasons, it's advisable to always consider building performance in holistic fashion in early/broader discussions. 

That's my (simple) take anyway!

I know that LEED is way more than just energy, and energy is way more than just equipment, but just for a basis, what SEER and EER do people have to use to get 10% better than ASHRAE 90.1 to qualify for LEED?  I also know that you don't have to use ASHRAE 90.1, but that is what I am doing.

So, what does it take?

My shot - Residential Apartment, individual DX units, 17 SEER and 13 EER in California CZ 12 (Mostly cooling).

  Next?

My current project has very good windows, "standard" walls, you're right 
about the lighting, it's right on budget (but residential doesn't really 
have a budget, so the small common areas are right on budget), better 
than standard roof.

I absolutely agree with you, Nick, on achieving 10% better, but all the 
trades point to the others.  It's kind of comical, actually.

I guess my question on this list could be rephrased, using your 
approach, as "What SEER is 10% better than SEER 13?"

Robert,
SEER is a seasonal energy efficiency ratio and is unitless.  It is the "cooling
output during a typical cooling-season divided by the total electric energy
input during the same period":
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_energy_efficiency_ratio.  A unit with
10% or better seasonal cooling energy efficiency over a 13 SEER unit would
have a SEER rating of 14.3 or greater (1.1x13) if all other operating
parameters were held constant.  See link for definitions and other
references.

To answer the SEER question, 1.1*13 = 14.3, all things being equal.  (If you're talking heatpumps, consider your HSPF's as well for the heating season.)

Again, this is all a simplified guideline for early decisionmaking, but the situation you're describing with all trades "pointing fingers" is exactly the paradigm I'm advising to kick out the door early to ensure success as a team.  It's much harder to do later in the game!  

Building performance is a team effort, and a team can only do as well as the weakest link.  If and when someone I'm working alongside is stubbornly designing "in a bubble" to the detriment of the project, I consider it as the energy modeler's imperitive to demonstrate this to the rest of the team if necessary.

As an example: More than once I've been able to give lighting designers a big "ah-ha!" moment by showing how major even a small LPD reduction can be when mechanical and envelope designers are pulling their weight.  It can also be humbling when you consider the costs implications of a 10% reduction in installed lighting wattage against the equivalent effects of getting all the premium bells and whistles for the chiller plant.

Nick,
I agree with you, and depending on what you are using as your evaluation
criteria throw in COP and other metrics as well.  If you have the
opportunity of working directly with the Owners early you should help them
set an energy target for the project or help them establish energy
efficiency standards for all energy using/consuming systems and components.
 A 10% improvement in your big three will not necessarily translate into a
10% improvement in total energy consumption of the whole building if that
is what Robert is trying to achieve.  It is a team effort and the owner has
to be at the top of the pyramid.  The owner has to be in the driver's seat
and buy into all of this in order to "burst the bubbles" of silo thinking
team members.  It is, after all, the owner's money.  Neither trades people
nor designers should be making decisions for the owner that the owner does
not understand or that does not meet the owners project requirements,
budget and expectations.
Dennis

Dear Syed,

The NRC link does not work anymore but you will find a copy of the library under: C:\Daysim\Daysim_Lighting_Materials.lib. This is an Ecotect material library that can be loaded into Ecotect via User Preferences.

I suppose the modeling software and how it treats energy might have 
something to do with it too (Note to CA and TDV), but for starters the 
modeling software will look at actual conditions in the particular place 
where the project is located.  As an absurd case, if there was no 
cooling needed, an infinite SEER would show no improvement.  SEER is for 
"typical" and each project is not necessarily typical.  For somewhere 
with a high cooling demand, SEER should have a greater effect, but 
cooling is only a small part of the energy budget.

I can appreciate that with "10% better walls, 10% better windows (or how 
about 10% less windows), 10% lower lighting wattages, 10% more efficient 
hot water, all compared to the standard, you could get 10% better using 
a SEER 14.3, but I have never gotten that result.  I suppose that I need 
to look harder at the other legs on the stool.  For me, I need SEER 17 
to get to 10% better in California with a somewhat lopsided stool.  I am 
curious what experience others have.

The theoretical answer may be "Make everything else use 10% less energy 
than standard and have a SEER 14.3 AC unit, and you're done" but to be 
honest, that doesn't ever work for me.

Maybe a better question is; have you ever gotten 10% better than ASHRAE 
90.1 with a 15 SEER AC system?  In a real project with real people 
fighting over costs, etc.?

Dennis,

Not to nitpick too much, but while SEER is a ratio, it is not unitless.  It's the cooling 
extraction rate in BTU/hr, divided by the electricity consumption in Watts.  COP is a 
truly unitless number, and is  smaller than the SEER by the ratio of 3.413, which is the 
conversion of BTU/hr to Watts.

Robert,
Simple answer is "No" - that is my point - it more than likely never will.
 You have to include all of your proposed energy conservation measures that
you are likely to apply into a single model with your user and
climate/local specific schedules and profiles included to see what
the aggregated savings maybe.  You can run multiple models changing only
one component to do some sensitivity analysis to see what
variables/measures may give you more dramatic changes in total energy
consumption, cost, carbon  emissions, indoor comfort, life cycle cost, life
cycle assessment, etc.  (which ever your client and you are using as your
decision making criteria).
As for the question regarding 10% energy reduction using 15 SEER equipment:
I've gotten 10% better energy performance using 90.1 minimum SEER compliant
equipment and effecting change in lighting power density, lighting
controls, controllable plug loads and better envelope/less infiltration,
better ventilation and properly downsizing the mechanical systems.  You do
not always have to improve the mechanical efficiency of the HVAC equipment
to achieve an energy efficiency improvement target.  It is a whole building
analysis that the owner's O&M behavior can have a major impact on.
 Conversely, I've had bleeding edge efficiency and complexity in the energy
using systems at some facilities and the buildings perform worse than an
minimum code compliant building  or a local median EUI when a custodian who
knows how to turn things off at night could have done better - when the
owner does not understand how the design team intended the building to be
operated when they made their analysis.  For example, I just investigated a
net zero energy house that was donated to an international non-profit.  It
has 22 SEER geothermal heat pumps, an envelope so tight it had no air
measurable leakage at 80 pascals, LED lighting, solar water heater, energy
recovery ventilator, solar PV, SIPS panel wall system, commercial grade low
e windows and a sophisticated energy monitoring system.  It is built right
next to a conventionally built house, stick framed, minimum residential
code compliant construction with 13 SEER air source heat pumps.  Both are
occupied by single mothers with two children.  The net zero house has worse
energy performance than the code minimum house almost entirely due to
occupant behavior. I personally did not believe you could operate that
house such that it would ever consume much energy, but you can.  In this
case the owner was not determined until after the house was constructed and
did not have a stake in the design and was not trained on the special
features of the house when it was offered to her.  Now that she has been
educated I can see some reductions - but the house is still falling way
short of its goal of net zerobecause the owner is just unwilling to change
her lifestyle no matter what the nergy costs are.

Man, every time I start a reply 3 more have come out, haha!  I think we're all pretty much on the same page though =).  This is largely written in response to Robert's most recent reply:

Applying 10% improvement to lighting/mechanical equipment/envelope is merely a strategy for achieving performance figures in the right ballpark once energy modeling begins.  No more and no less.  I can attest this has worked well for me in the past, but I never meant to imply "..and you're done."

This is just a means of getting the ball rolling and ensuring the important decision makers understand they have a role to play.

I agree completely regarding the limits of SEER and every other standardized efficiency rating I've worked with.  Seasonal and steady state efficiencies are NEVER direct indicators of actual system consumptions, they are merely representations of performance under specific conditions.  That said, they do have a useful time & place which occurs at the beginning of a project, before a more detailed analysis can be made with energy models or otherwise.  SEER may or may not be an inadequate efficiency metric for your specific climate, but that doesn't change what defines your baseline equipment.

If the goal is simply to reduce heating and cooling energy consumptions of your HVAC systems by XX%, and I can't build something resembling the final design for an energy model, I simply can't offer a better answer than "improve your heating and cooling efficiencies by XX%," recognizing this alone will not get you there if your lighting consumptions and envelope performance do not do their part.

A black and white answer to what minimum performance is required of any system for any specific LEED project goal is truly unapproachable until you start the energy model that will determine the results ;).

As it happens however, I can answer Robert's most recent hypothetical almost directly:  I have performed a preliminary study for a building in the vicinity of El Paso, TX using 15 SEER AHU's with energy recovery.  I determined a 30% LEED improvement would have been attainable using an envelope matching 90.1 baseline constructions, but this entailed a roughly 50% LPD reduction (I would have performed the lighting design and can attest this was achievable), and a healthy laundry list of EEM's for mechanical, with a heavy service hot water equipment load helping things along.

So to wrap up, I'd say 15 SEER units absolutely can be one part of a bigger picture achieving a 10% LEED performance rating.

Apologies for the walls of text... sometimes the quick & easy answer is "there aren't any quick and easy answers!"  Hope this discussion is helpful to you and yours in any case!

The theoretical answer may be "Make everything else use 10% less energy than standard and have a SEER 14.3 AC unit, and you're done" but to be honest, that doesn't ever work for me.

Maybe a better question is; have you ever gotten 10% better than ASHRAE 90.1 with a 15 SEER AC system?  In a real project with real people fighting over costs, etc.?

I absolutely agree with you, Nick, on achieving 10% better, but all the trades point to the others.  It's kind of comical, actually.

I guess my question on this list could be rephrased, using your approach, as "What SEER is 10% better than SEER 13?"

A very simple way of looking at LEED & energy, which I come back to often for discussions on that level, is to consider a building's performance like a tripod with three important legs:  Lights, Mechanical, and Envelope.  If any of those legs is too short, the tripod falls over.

Building on that analogy, to do 10% better than a LEED baseline, a good starting place is to have at least:
-  10% better lighting (10% lower LPD),
-  10% better HVAC & hot water heating (10% better efficiencies), and
-  10% better envelope (10% more insulation in walls/roof, 10% better windows).
For each of these, you can source the baseline/prescriptive levels from the standard of your choosing.

Overperforming in one area can sometimes make up for underperfomance in another, but with diminishing returns.  Amazing HVAC equipment/design has a harder time shining when you have a poor envelope and/or the lighting designer treats LPD's as a "budget" they have to use up.  For such reasons, it's advisable to always consider building performance in holistic fashion in early/broader discussions.

That's my (simple) take anyway!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED - What does it take?

I know that LEED is way more than just energy, and energy is way more than just equipment, but just for a basis, what SEER and EER do people have to use to get 10% better than ASHRAE 90.1 to qualify for LEED?  I also know that you don't have to use ASHRAE 90.1, but that is what I am doing.

So, what does it take?

My shot - Residential Apartment, individual DX units, 17 SEER and 13 EER in California CZ 12 (Mostly cooling).

   Next?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Radiance International Workshop 2013
Message-ID: <CD1DD838.18FDF%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>

Greetings simulationists,

A couple months ago I polled these lists for consensus on dates for the
2013 International Radiance Workshop (which we are hosting here at NREL),
and we have settled on August 12-14 (Mon-Wed). The three-day format --
with tutorials on day one and presentations on days two and three -- seems
to have become the standard, so at this time I'd like to get some ideas
from you on what exactly the tutorial content should be.

In the past, the tutorial day has ranged from an HDR imaging workshop
(e.g. 2009-Boston), in-depth dives into new Radiance code additions (e.g.
2011-Berkeley), and in 2003 there were actually *two* tutorial tracks to
pick from: new feature deep dive with Greg Ward, and Radiance 101 with
John Mardaljevic (decisions, decisions!).

Now's our chance to flesh out what this year's tutorial day will look
like. A couple of folks contacted me off-list(s) to inquire about the
possibility of holding an OpenStudio training on that day, particularly
focusing on the use of OpenStudio for Radiance-informed energy analysis.
So, there's one idea. What else ya'll got? DAYSIM show & tell? HDR imaging
again? Feats of strength? Seriously, I'm interested in hearing your ideas
(and your intentions of attending) so we can decide if we're to have one
or more tracks, and what the content will be. So please, lemmeknow. I'll
probably gather up all of your responses and then put it to a vote.

Looking forward to seeing many of you in August!

- Googs

P.S. We will definitely offer tours of our new energy efficient campus
buildings as well. We have a 330,000 ft^2 net zero office building (where
the workshop will be held), super-efficient (and daylit) parking garage
and cafeteria, and, by the time of the workshop, a grid-scale test
facility with the most energy-efficient petascale supercomputer in the
world (PUE <= 1.06). And we have lots of mountains right next door!

Dear All,

I added the weather data that I received from Weather Analytics in the 3rd
row, and the data from White Box Technologies (IWEC2) in the 4th.

Here is the graphs:
https://dl.dropbox.com/u/16228160/Sydney_Weather_Data_Comparision_II.jpg

And here is the graphs with normalized scales for row 3 and row 4:
https://dl.dropbox.com/u/16228160/Sydney_Weather_Data_Comparision_II_Normalized.jpg

The pattern of the radiation rose for both graphs are mostly similar to
IWEC graph, however the wind-rose for Weather Analytics file is slightly
skewed toward north-west. As a conclusion there should be an issue with the
RMY file.

I also did a comparison for average global and direct normal radiation
between the three weather files (IWEC, WeatherAnalytics, IWEC2). Average
global radiation in WeatherAnalytics data is 9.1% more then IWEC2. This
number is 20.7% more for direct normal radiation.
Here are the graphs for monthly and annual comparison:
https://dl.dropbox.com/u/16228160/radiationComparison_Charts.jpg

Unfortunately I don't have the measured data for comparison.

Excel spreadsheet is attached to this email.

Mostapha

Mostapha,

So what was your conclusion about the hourly profile in the solar radiation, which was 
your original question?
I contend that since Sydney is close to the standard meridian for its time zone (150 
degrees east), the solar profile should be symmetrical around noon.

On the total amounts of solar radiation, I have no basis to judge between the three.  Did 
you leave off the RMY for some reason?  Since these are all "typical year" weather files, 
they are likely to be different months from different years. Overall, it does seem that 
the WX is showing more solar than the IWEC or IWEC2, which are quite close.  The larger 
variation in direct normal is understandable, since all the models (as well as 
measurements) show that when total goes down, the fraction direct goes down even more.

The only way to evaluate these weather files is to find some actual measurements, even if 
it's just of monthly or year totals. Otherwise, we can only say that there are differences.

Dear all,

I am using eQUEST for an energy simulation for LEED. I was wondering  
if from your experience you know if LEED requires custom curves for  
HVAC systems. I saw there are around 15 curves that could be  
customised for a PVVT system. Which performance curves are actually  
required? Thank you in advance.

Kind regards,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] PIU Temperature Schedule in eQuest
Message-ID: <7EDBD70621C6AA448E2778779FDC5BC655B32355@MBX201.domain.local>

All,

Does anybody understand what the zone-level temperature schedule does for a PIU system with parallel-PIU fan control (in eQuest)?

My understanding is that for a PIU system, zone level fans (in a parallel configuration) are only activated during heating hours (is this true?) and draw return air from the plenum to mix with the primary air, thereby taking advantage of the heat in the plenum. It would be counterproductive to do this in cooling mode as the primary air is typically at 55F, much cooler than plenum air.

If my assumption is correct, I am confused by the definition for the Temperature Schedule (called Zone-Fan-T-Sch in the help file), which reads: "Required if Zone: Terminal-Typ = PARALLEL-PIU. Takes the U-name of a schedule (type = temperature) that gives the zone temperature at which the terminal blower turns on. This temperature must be above the heating range."

Why should this temperature be above the heating range? What heating range is this referring to? I would have thought the temperature would be the temperature BELOW which the fans turn on to provide additional heating...in other words, if you're trying to maintain 70F in the space, the fans would be activated at 69F or thereabouts. Does anyone know what this Temperature Schedule does exactly?

Any insight is appreciated.

Chris

My two five cents - adding to the many cents already thrown in the pot.


*         LEED & Appendix G at this point are based on energy cost - not raw BTUs or carbon. So the relative costs of your fuel mix will have an effect on final scores (in a place where electricity is cheap and heating fuel is not - you are likely going to have less credit for your SEER rating). I don't agree with it, but that's how the system is set up.

*         The effectiveness depends on your baseline energy usage. For example - if you have a building that has very small HVAC component, even a 50% reduction won't get you to 10% overall.

*         LEED addresses consumption and not efficiency (which is a good thing). So you get credit for 'driving less'. Hours that you don't need to run your HVAC = money in your pocket (the envelope leg of Nick's tripod analogy).

*         It also depends on other factors like how you deliver the energy. For example - using hydronic cooling & heating will likely save you more energy than an all air system with a higher EER on the chiller. Using a waterside economizer goes back to the 'driving less' analogy. Hydronic systems are also less prone to reheat (simultaneous heating & cooling) issues that you have with all air systems.

The way I like to approach LEED projects is to go after the intent of the credits rather than the point - you'll be surprised at how often you end up with a higher LEED score when you do.

Apologies to Robert if this doesn't directly respond to the original question.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] LEED - What does it take?

Man, every time I start a reply 3 more have come out, haha!  I think we're all pretty much on the same page though =).  This is largely written in response to Robert's most recent reply:

Applying 10% improvement to lighting/mechanical equipment/envelope is merely a strategy for achieving performance figures in the right ballpark once energy modeling begins.  No more and no less.  I can attest this has worked well for me in the past, but I never meant to imply "..and you're done."

This is just a means of getting the ball rolling and ensuring the important decision makers understand they have a role to play.

I agree completely regarding the limits of SEER and every other standardized efficiency rating I've worked with.  Seasonal and steady state efficiencies are NEVER direct indicators of actual system consumptions, they are merely representations of performance under specific conditions.  That said, they do have a useful time & place which occurs at the beginning of a project, before a more detailed analysis can be made with energy models or otherwise.  SEER may or may not be an inadequate efficiency metric for your specific climate, but that doesn't change what defines your baseline equipment.

If the goal is simply to reduce heating and cooling energy consumptions of your HVAC systems by XX%, and I can't build something resembling the final design for an energy model, I simply can't offer a better answer than "improve your heating and cooling efficiencies by XX%," recognizing this alone will not get you there if your lighting consumptions and envelope performance do not do their part.

A black and white answer to what minimum performance is required of any system for any specific LEED project goal is truly unapproachable until you start the energy model that will determine the results ;).

As it happens however, I can answer Robert's most recent hypothetical almost directly:  I have performed a preliminary study for a building in the vicinity of El Paso, TX using 15 SEER AHU's with energy recovery.  I determined a 30% LEED improvement would have been attainable using an envelope matching 90.1 baseline constructions, but this entailed a roughly 50% LPD reduction (I would have performed the lighting design and can attest this was achievable), and a healthy laundry list of EEM's for mechanical, with a heavy service hot water equipment load helping things along.

So to wrap up, I'd say 15 SEER units absolutely can be one part of a bigger picture achieving a 10% LEED performance rating.

Apologies for the walls of text... sometimes the quick & easy answer is "there aren't any quick and easy answers!"  Hope this discussion is helpful to you and yours in any case!

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] LEED - What does it take?

Robert,
Simple answer is "No" - that is my point - it more than likely never will.  You have to include all of your proposed energy conservation measures that you are likely to apply into a single model with your user and climate/local specific schedules and profiles included to see what the aggregated savings maybe.  You can run multiple models changing only one component to do some sensitivity analysis to see what variables/measures may give you more dramatic changes in total energy consumption, cost, carbon  emissions, indoor comfort, life cycle cost, life cycle assessment, etc.  (which ever your client and you are using as your decision making criteria).
As for the question regarding 10% energy reduction using 15 SEER equipment: I've gotten 10% better energy performance using 90.1 minimum SEER compliant equipment and effecting change in lighting power density, lighting controls, controllable plug loads and better envelope/less infiltration, better ventilation and properly downsizing the mechanical systems.  You do not always have to improve the mechanical efficiency of the HVAC equipment to achieve an energy efficiency improvement target.  It is a whole building analysis that the owner's O&M behavior can have a major impact on.  Conversely, I've had bleeding edge efficiency and complexity in the energy using systems at some facilities and the buildings perform worse than an minimum code compliant building  or a local median EUI when a custodian who knows how to turn things off at night could have done better - when the owner does not understand how the design team intended the building to be operated when they made their analysis.  For example, I just investigated a net zero energy house that was donated to an international non-profit.  It has 22 SEER geothermal heat pumps, an envelope so tight it had no air measurable leakage at 80 pascals, LED lighting, solar water heater, energy recovery ventilator, solar PV, SIPS panel wall system, commercial grade low e windows and a sophisticated energy monitoring system.  It is built right next to a conventionally built house, stick framed, minimum residential code compliant construction with 13 SEER air source heat pumps.  Both are occupied by single mothers with two children.  The net zero house has worse energy performance than the code minimum house almost entirely due to occupant behavior. I personally did not believe you could operate that house such that it would ever consume much energy, but you can.  In this case the owner was not determined until after the house was constructed and did not have a stake in the design and was not trained on the special features of the house when it was offered to her.  Now that she has been educated I can see some reductions - but the house is still falling way short of its goal of net zerobecause the owner is just unwilling to change her lifestyle no matter what the nergy costs are.

I suppose the modeling software and how it treats energy might have something to do with it too (Note to CA and TDV), but for starters the modeling software will look at actual conditions in the particular place where the project is located.  As an absurd case, if there was no cooling needed, an infinite SEER would show no improvement.  SEER is for "typical" and each project is not necessarily typical.  For somewhere with a high cooling demand, SEER should have a greater effect, but cooling is only a small part of the energy budget.

I can appreciate that with "10% better walls, 10% better windows (or how about 10% less windows), 10% lower lighting wattages, 10% more efficient hot water, all compared to the standard, you could get 10% better using a SEER 14.3, but I have never gotten that result.  I suppose that I need to look harder at the other legs on the stool.  For me, I need SEER 17 to get to 10% better in California with a somewhat lopsided stool.  I am curious what experience others have.

The theoretical answer may be "Make everything else use 10% less energy than standard and have a SEER 14.3 AC unit, and you're done" but to be honest, that doesn't ever work for me.

Maybe a better question is; have you ever gotten 10% better than ASHRAE 90.1 with a 15 SEER AC system?  In a real project with real people fighting over costs, etc.?

Robert,
SEER is a seasonal energy efficiency ratio and is unitless.  It is the "cooling output during a typical cooling-season divided by the total electric energy input during the same period": http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_energy_efficiency_ratio.  A unit with 10% or better seasonal cooling energy efficiency over a 13 SEER unit would have a SEER rating of 14.3 or greater (1.1x13) if all other operating parameters were held constant.  See link for definitions and other references.

My current project has very good windows, "standard" walls, you're right about the lighting, it's right on budget (but residential doesn't really have a budget, so the small common areas are right on budget), better than standard roof.

I absolutely agree with you, Nick, on achieving 10% better, but all the trades point to the others.  It's kind of comical, actually.

I guess my question on this list could be rephrased, using your approach, as "What SEER is 10% better than SEER 13?"

A very simple way of looking at LEED & energy, which I come back to often for discussions on that level, is to consider a building's performance like a tripod with three important legs:  Lights, Mechanical, and Envelope.  If any of those legs is too short, the tripod falls over.

Building on that analogy, to do 10% better than a LEED baseline, a good starting place is to have at least:
-  10% better lighting (10% lower LPD),
-  10% better HVAC & hot water heating (10% better efficiencies), and
-  10% better envelope (10% more insulation in walls/roof, 10% better windows).
For each of these, you can source the baseline/prescriptive levels from the standard of your choosing.

Overperforming in one area can sometimes make up for underperfomance in another, but with diminishing returns.  Amazing HVAC equipment/design has a harder time shining when you have a poor envelope and/or the lighting designer treats LPD's as a "budget" they have to use up.  For such reasons, it's advisable to always consider building performance in holistic fashion in early/broader discussions.

That's my (simple) take anyway!

I know that LEED is way more than just energy, and energy is way more than just equipment, but just for a basis, what SEER and EER do people have to use to get 10% better than ASHRAE 90.1 to qualify for LEED?  I also know that you don't have to use ASHRAE 90.1, but that is what I am doing.

So, what does it take?

My shot - Residential Apartment, individual DX units, 17 SEER and 13 EER in California CZ 12 (Mostly cooling).

   Next?

I have been following this discussion, not as an engineer or modeler, but as
someone interested in the factors influencing the financial return on energy
saving products.  My concern is in the same area as Vikram Sami expressed
below but even a little deeper.  Vikram rightly notes that energy costs vary
from location to location so a unit saved one place is not necessarily
comparable to another location.  I would add two other factors that are very
important in an energy efficiency decision - rate structure and time of
energy saving. The bottom line is that an energy unit saved is based on both
the rate structure and the time of day that negative watt was earned.

 

Rate structure factors such as demand response, peak demand, and off hours
rates drive the value of reducing energy usage.  Some utilities offer very
low rates at night.  If you have a building element - such as our Phase
Change Material or Ice Energy's storage process - that can store energy
during the low rate hours; then this energy is available to offset demand
during a peak rate periods.  

 

If a product can reduce the energy usage during a high rate period in a high
rate location then that energy saved should command a higher value in not
only a LEED certifications calculation but in calculating the value in an
energy modeling program for ROI.

 

I am not an expert on energy modeling nor do I know about all the models
available, so this comment needs to be understood from my product
perspective and most likely, my limited knowledge.  It seems to me that most
models are driven by weather data.  Weather data and location drive the
design of the building shell. A building is built to live and work in.
Efficiently managing the internal environment demands managing energy use
for not only the effects from the outside environment but also the comfort
and use of its occupants.  I am excited about the future of building control
systems based on sensors.  This trend will help solve the problems I noted
above but they do more than just save units of energy, they will save energy
at the most expensive moments.  

 

As an MBA - not an engineer - the key here is twofold.  How much energy can
I save with the package of energy saving options available to me and what is
the cost of a unit of energy when I save it.

My two five cents - adding to the many cents already thrown in the pot. 

 

.       LEED & Appendix G at this point are based on energy cost - not raw
BTUs or carbon. So the relative costs of your fuel mix will have an effect
on final scores (in a place where electricity is cheap and heating fuel is
not - you are likely going to have less credit for your SEER rating). I
don't agree with it, but that's how the system is set up.

.       The effectiveness depends on your baseline energy usage. For example
- if you have a building that has very small HVAC component, even a 50%
reduction won't get you to 10% overall. 

.       LEED addresses consumption and not efficiency (which is a good
thing). So you get credit for 'driving less'. Hours that you don't need to
run your HVAC = money in your pocket (the envelope leg of Nick's tripod
analogy). 

.       It also depends on other factors like how you deliver the energy.
For example - using hydronic cooling & heating will likely save you more
energy than an all air system with a higher EER on the chiller. Using a
waterside economizer goes back to the 'driving less' analogy. Hydronic
systems are also less prone to reheat (simultaneous heating & cooling)
issues that you have with all air systems. 

 

The way I like to approach LEED projects is to go after the intent of the
credits rather than the point - you'll be surprised at how often you end up
with a higher LEED score when you do. 

 

Apologies to Robert if this doesn't directly respond to the original
question.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] LEED - What does it take?

 

Man, every time I start a reply 3 more have come out, haha!  I think we're
all pretty much on the same page though =).  This is largely written in
response to Robert's most recent reply:

 

Applying 10% improvement to lighting/mechanical equipment/envelope is merely
a strategy for achieving performance figures in the right ballpark once
energy modeling begins.  No more and no less.  I can attest this has worked
well for me in the past, but I never meant to imply "..and you're done."  

 

This is just a means of getting the ball rolling and ensuring the important
decision makers understand they have a role to play.

 

I agree completely regarding the limits of SEER and every other standardized
efficiency rating I've worked with.  Seasonal and steady state efficiencies
are NEVER direct indicators of actual system consumptions, they are merely
representations of performance under specific conditions.  That said, they
do have a useful time & place which occurs at the beginning of a project,
before a more detailed analysis can be made with energy models or otherwise.
SEER may or may not be an inadequate efficiency metric for your specific
climate, but that doesn't change what defines your baseline equipment. 

 

If the goal is simply to reduce heating and cooling energy consumptions of
your HVAC systems by XX%, and I can't build something resembling the final
design for an energy model, I simply can't offer a better answer than
"improve your heating and cooling efficiencies by XX%," recognizing this
alone will not get you there if your lighting consumptions and envelope
performance do not do their part.  

 

A black and white answer to what minimum performance is required of any
system for any specific LEED project goal is truly unapproachable until you
start the energy model that will determine the results ;). 

 

As it happens however, I can answer Robert's most recent hypothetical almost
directly:  I have performed a preliminary study for a building in the
vicinity of El Paso, TX using 15 SEER AHU's with energy recovery.  I
determined a 30% LEED improvement would have been attainable using an

Robert,

Simple answer is "No" - that is my point - it more than likely never will.
You have to include all of your proposed energy conservation measures that
you are likely to apply into a single model with your user and climate/local
specific schedules and profiles included to see what the aggregated savings
maybe.  You can run multiple models changing only one component to do some
sensitivity analysis to see what variables/measures may give you more
dramatic changes in total energy consumption, cost, carbon  emissions,
indoor comfort, life cycle cost, life cycle assessment, etc.  (which ever
your client and you are using as your decision making criteria).

As for the question regarding 10% energy reduction using 15 SEER equipment:
I've gotten 10% better energy performance using 90.1 minimum SEER compliant
equipment and effecting change in lighting power density, lighting controls,
controllable plug loads and better envelope/less infiltration, better
ventilation and properly downsizing the mechanical systems.  You do not
always have to improve the mechanical efficiency of the HVAC equipment to
achieve an energy efficiency improvement target.  It is a whole building
analysis that the owner's O&M behavior can have a major impact on.
Conversely, I've had bleeding edge efficiency and complexity in the energy
using systems at some facilities and the buildings perform worse than an
minimum code compliant building  or a local median EUI when a custodian who
knows how to turn things off at night could have done better - when the
owner does not understand how the design team intended the building to be
operated when they made their analysis.  For example, I just investigated a
net zero energy house that was donated to an international non-profit.  It
has 22 SEER geothermal heat pumps, an envelope so tight it had no air
measurable leakage at 80 pascals, LED lighting, solar water heater, energy
recovery ventilator, solar PV, SIPS panel wall system, commercial grade low
e windows and a sophisticated energy monitoring system.  It is built right
next to a conventionally built house, stick framed, minimum residential code
compliant construction with 13 SEER air source heat pumps.  Both are
occupied by single mothers with two children.  The net zero house has worse
energy performance than the code minimum house almost entirely due to
occupant behavior. I personally did not believe you could operate that house
such that it would ever consume much energy, but you can.  In this case the
owner was not determined until after the house was constructed and did not
have a stake in the design and was not trained on the special features of
the house when it was offered to her.  Now that she has been educated I can
see some reductions - but the house is still falling way short of its goal
of net zerobecause the owner is just unwilling to change her lifestyle no
matter what the nergy costs are.

Maybe a better question is; have you ever gotten 10% better than ASHRAE 90.1

A very simple way of looking at LEED & energy, which I come back to often
for discussions on that level, is to consider a building's performance like
a tripod with three important legs:  Lights, Mechanical, and Envelope.  If
any of those legs is too short, the tripod falls over.

Building on that analogy, to do 10% better than a LEED baseline, a good
starting place is to have at least:
-  10% better lighting (10% lower LPD),
-  10% better HVAC & hot water heating (10% better efficiencies), and
-  10% better envelope (10% more insulation in walls/roof, 10% better
windows).
For each of these, you can source the baseline/prescriptive levels from the
standard of your choosing.

Overperforming in one area can sometimes make up for underperfomance in
another, but with diminishing returns.  Amazing HVAC equipment/design has a
harder time shining when you have a poor envelope and/or the lighting
designer treats LPD's as a "budget" they have to use up.  For such reasons,
it's advisable to always consider building performance in holistic fashion
in early/broader discussions.

That's my (simple) take anyway!

I know that LEED is way more than just energy, and energy is way more than
just equipment, but just for a basis, what SEER and EER do people have to
use to get 10% better than ASHRAE 90.1 to qualify for LEED?  I also know
that you don't have to use ASHRAE 90.1, but that is what I am doing.

So, what does it take?

My shot - Residential Apartment, individual DX units, 17 SEER and 13 EER in

Hear!  Hear!
Joe's comments about how the rate structure affects savings are worth emphasizing.  These are in place by local utilities for a reason - meeting peak demands is often very costly for the utilities and they pass it on to their customers.  I don't recall the details of a talk I heard at ASHRAE's last Energy Modeling Conference, but I'm pretty sure those peak power plants are also less efficient than the base power plants (which may explain part of the reason for higher peak costs).  I've run a couple of energy models with and without the demand charges and have seen big differences in cost.  That, in turn, has led to more diligence in representing the rate structure accurately in my models.
As a side note, a few years back I was not a fan of locally-generated (including renewable) power schemes because their efficiency was uniformly dismal and it seemed that their only reason for viability was federal government subsidies.  As I've become more aware of the base / peak power big picture economics, I am reversing my opinion.  Compared to running a peak power plant, it seems they can be a very viable economic solution even without subsidies.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] LEED - What does it take?

I have been following this discussion, not as an engineer or modeler, but as someone interested in the factors influencing the financial return on energy saving products.  My concern is in the same area as Vikram Sami expressed below but even a little deeper.  Vikram rightly notes that energy costs vary from location to location so a unit saved one place is not necessarily comparable to another location.  I would add two other factors that are very important in an energy efficiency decision - rate structure and time of energy saving. The bottom line is that an energy unit saved is based on both  the rate structure and the time of day that negative watt was earned.

Rate structure factors such as demand response, peak demand, and off hours rates drive the value of reducing energy usage.  Some utilities offer very low rates at night.  If you have a building element - such as our Phase Change Material or Ice Energy's storage process - that can store energy during the low rate hours; then this energy is available to offset demand during a peak rate periods.

If a product can reduce the energy usage during a high rate period in a high rate location then that energy saved should command a higher value in not only a LEED certifications calculation but in calculating the value in an energy modeling program for ROI.

I am not an expert on energy modeling nor do I know about all the models available, so this comment needs to be understood from my product perspective and most likely, my limited knowledge.  It seems to me that most models are driven by weather data.  Weather data and location drive the design of the building shell. A building is built to live and work in.  Efficiently managing the internal environment demands managing energy use for not only the effects from the outside environment but also the comfort and use of its occupants.  I am excited about the future of building control systems based on sensors.  This trend will help solve the problems I noted above but they do more than just save units of energy, they will save energy at the most expensive moments.

As an MBA - not an engineer - the key here is twofold.  How much energy can I save with the package of energy saving options available to me and what is the cost of a unit of energy when I save it.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] LEED - What does it take?

My two five cents - adding to the many cents already thrown in the pot.


*         LEED & Appendix G at this point are based on energy cost - not raw BTUs or carbon. So the relative costs of your fuel mix will have an effect on final scores (in a place where electricity is cheap and heating fuel is not - you are likely going to have less credit for your SEER rating). I don't agree with it, but that's how the system is set up.

*         The effectiveness depends on your baseline energy usage. For example - if you have a building that has very small HVAC component, even a 50% reduction won't get you to 10% overall.

*         LEED addresses consumption and not efficiency (which is a good thing). So you get credit for 'driving less'. Hours that you don't need to run your HVAC = money in your pocket (the envelope leg of Nick's tripod analogy).

*         It also depends on other factors like how you deliver the energy. For example - using hydronic cooling & heating will likely save you more energy than an all air system with a higher EER on the chiller. Using a waterside economizer goes back to the 'driving less' analogy. Hydronic systems are also less prone to reheat (simultaneous heating & cooling) issues that you have with all air systems.

The way I like to approach LEED projects is to go after the intent of the credits rather than the point - you'll be surprised at how often you end up with a higher LEED score when you do.

Apologies to Robert if this doesn't directly respond to the original question.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] LEED - What does it take?

Man, every time I start a reply 3 more have come out, haha!  I think we're all pretty much on the same page though =).  This is largely written in response to Robert's most recent reply:

Applying 10% improvement to lighting/mechanical equipment/envelope is merely a strategy for achieving performance figures in the right ballpark once energy modeling begins.  No more and no less.  I can attest this has worked well for me in the past, but I never meant to imply "..and you're done."

This is just a means of getting the ball rolling and ensuring the important decision makers understand they have a role to play.

I agree completely regarding the limits of SEER and every other standardized efficiency rating I've worked with.  Seasonal and steady state efficiencies are NEVER direct indicators of actual system consumptions, they are merely representations of performance under specific conditions.  That said, they do have a useful time & place which occurs at the beginning of a project, before a more detailed analysis can be made with energy models or otherwise.  SEER may or may not be an inadequate efficiency metric for your specific climate, but that doesn't change what defines your baseline equipment.

If the goal is simply to reduce heating and cooling energy consumptions of your HVAC systems by XX%, and I can't build something resembling the final design for an energy model, I simply can't offer a better answer than "improve your heating and cooling efficiencies by XX%," recognizing this alone will not get you there if your lighting consumptions and envelope performance do not do their part.

A black and white answer to what minimum performance is required of any system for any specific LEED project goal is truly unapproachable until you start the energy model that will determine the results ;).

As it happens however, I can answer Robert's most recent hypothetical almost directly:  I have performed a preliminary study for a building in the vicinity of El Paso, TX using 15 SEER AHU's with energy recovery.  I determined a 30% LEED improvement would have been attainable using an envelope matching 90.1 baseline constructions, but this entailed a roughly 50% LPD reduction (I would have performed the lighting design and can attest this was achievable), and a healthy laundry list of EEM's for mechanical, with a heavy service hot water equipment load helping things along.

So to wrap up, I'd say 15 SEER units absolutely can be one part of a bigger picture achieving a 10% LEED performance rating.

Apologies for the walls of text... sometimes the quick & easy answer is "there aren't any quick and easy answers!"  Hope this discussion is helpful to you and yours in any case!

A very simple way of looking at LEED & energy, which I come back to often for discussions on that level, is to consider a building's performance like a tripod with three important legs:  Lights, Mechanical, and Envelope.  If any of those legs is too short, the tripod falls over.

Building on that analogy, to do 10% better than a LEED baseline, a good starting place is to have at least:
-  10% better lighting (10% lower LPD),
-  10% better HVAC & hot water heating (10% better efficiencies), and
-  10% better envelope (10% more insulation in walls/roof, 10% better windows).
For each of these, you can source the baseline/prescriptive levels from the standard of your choosing.

Overperforming in one area can sometimes make up for underperfomance in another, but with diminishing returns.  Amazing HVAC equipment/design has a harder time shining when you have a poor envelope and/or the lighting designer treats LPD's as a "budget" they have to use up.  For such reasons, it's advisable to always consider building performance in holistic fashion in early/broader discussions.

That's my (simple) take anyway!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED - What does it take?

I know that LEED is way more than just energy, and energy is way more than just equipment, but just for a basis, what SEER and EER do people have to use to get 10% better than ASHRAE 90.1 to qualify for LEED?  I also know that you don't have to use ASHRAE 90.1, but that is what I am doing.

So, what does it take?

My shot - Residential Apartment, individual DX units, 17 SEER and 13 EER in California CZ 12 (Mostly cooling).

   Next?

I agree that the help file language is a bit confusing.  I've always set
this parameter to the same value that is used at the zone level heating
thermostat schedule and never thought twice about it.
 For curiosity's sake, you could likely run an hourly report to determine
that the parallel fan is operating as you think it should.

To solve your problem, I usually just define a user-default expression of
#L("HEAT-TEMP-SCH").  This sets the parallel fan-powered schedule equal to
the zone thermostat schedule automatically.

Dear all, I too have been following this very sensible discussion and now feel the need to throw my comments into the ring. So here goes:
Where are we going with all our simulation and LEED paraphernalia? It would appear that LEED compliance has turned into a numbers game and doesn't require engineering techniques but more like a cross between and MBA and an Attorney (I know what was written, but that isn't the intent of what was written). Basic engineering skills have been replaced by wizardry and unmet hours and most often than not the comparison of a base case to a proposed case are the source of the proposed savings. Why do you think the US is so slow into moving towards performance metrics? Maybe it's because the present way buildings are modeled to comply with LEED have no relationship to how buildings actually perform or more probably the liability of an engineer stating that a certain performance can be achieved based upon a simulation model and the possible shortcomings in a real building.
So what do we do? The easiest way would be to sit back and continue with what is accepted or we could look into the future and decide what import features are most required. This would most probably require a rigorous change to the current standards, but maybe that is what is required?
We are all stuck with applicable utility rates, buildings need lighting and power for equipment, we have people in buildings and architects put glass in buildings and the end result is energy and the cost of energy. Yes, there are many sources of alternative energy, but these have been relatively slow to emerge and are very costly. So if you have immense wealth one could attain a net- zero building or many 'net zero' buildings do not fully utilize lighting and equipment. So why would we require simulation models and compliance documents if we simply choose not to operate building equipment?

Hear!  Hear!
Joe's comments about how the rate structure affects savings are worth emphasizing.  These are in place by local utilities for a reason - meeting peak demands is often very costly for the utilities and they pass it on to their customers.  I don't recall the details of a talk I heard at ASHRAE's last Energy Modeling Conference, but I'm pretty sure those peak power plants are also less efficient than the base power plants (which may explain part of the reason for higher peak costs).  I've run a couple of energy models with and without the demand charges and have seen big differences in cost.  That, in turn, has led to more diligence in representing the rate structure accurately in my models.
As a side note, a few years back I was not a fan of locally-generated (including renewable) power schemes because their efficiency was uniformly dismal and it seemed that their only reason for viability was federal government subsidies.  As I've become more aware of the base / peak power big picture economics, I am reversing my opinion.  Compared to running a peak power plant, it seems they can be a very viable economic solution even without subsidies.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] LEED - What does it take?

I have been following this discussion, not as an engineer or modeler, but as someone interested in the factors influencing the financial return on energy saving products.  My concern is in the same area as Vikram Sami expressed below but even a little deeper.  Vikram rightly notes that energy costs vary from location to location so a unit saved one place is not necessarily comparable to another location.  I would add two other factors that are very important in an energy efficiency decision - rate structure and time of energy saving. The bottom line is that an energy unit saved is based on both  the rate structure and the time of day that negative watt was earned.

Rate structure factors such as demand response, peak demand, and off hours rates drive the value of reducing energy usage.  Some utilities offer very low rates at night.  If you have a building element - such as our Phase Change Material or Ice Energy's storage process - that can store energy during the low rate hours; then this energy is available to offset demand during a peak rate periods.

If a product can reduce the energy usage during a high rate period in a high rate location then that energy saved should command a higher value in not only a LEED certifications calculation but in calculating the value in an energy modeling program for ROI.

I am not an expert on energy modeling nor do I know about all the models available, so this comment needs to be understood from my product perspective and most likely, my limited knowledge.  It seems to me that most models are driven by weather data.  Weather data and location drive the design of the building shell. A building is built to live and work in.  Efficiently managing the internal environment demands managing energy use for not only the effects from the outside environment but also the comfort and use of its occupants.  I am excited about the future of building control systems based on sensors.  This trend will help solve the problems I noted above but they do more than just save units of energy, they will save energy at the most expensive moments.

As an MBA - not an engineer - the key here is twofold.  How much energy can I save with the package of energy saving options available to me and what is the cost of a unit of energy when I save it.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] LEED - What does it take?

My two five cents - adding to the many cents already thrown in the pot.


*         LEED & Appendix G at this point are based on energy cost - not raw BTUs or carbon. So the relative costs of your fuel mix will have an effect on final scores (in a place where electricity is cheap and heating fuel is not - you are likely going to have less credit for your SEER rating). I don't agree with it, but that's how the system is set up.

*         The effectiveness depends on your baseline energy usage. For example - if you have a building that has very small HVAC component, even a 50% reduction won't get you to 10% overall.

*         LEED addresses consumption and not efficiency (which is a good thing). So you get credit for 'driving less'. Hours that you don't need to run your HVAC = money in your pocket (the envelope leg of Nick's tripod analogy).

*         It also depends on other factors like how you deliver the energy. For example - using hydronic cooling & heating will likely save you more energy than an all air system with a higher EER on the chiller. Using a waterside economizer goes back to the 'driving less' analogy. Hydronic systems are also less prone to reheat (simultaneous heating & cooling) issues that you have with all air systems.

The way I like to approach LEED projects is to go after the intent of the credits rather than the point - you'll be surprised at how often you end up with a higher LEED score when you do.

Apologies to Robert if this doesn't directly respond to the original question.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] LEED - What does it take?

Man, every time I start a reply 3 more have come out, haha!  I think we're all pretty much on the same page though =).  This is largely written in response to Robert's most recent reply:

Applying 10% improvement to lighting/mechanical equipment/envelope is merely a strategy for achieving performance figures in the right ballpark once energy modeling begins.  No more and no less.  I can attest this has worked well for me in the past, but I never meant to imply "..and you're done."

This is just a means of getting the ball rolling and ensuring the important decision makers understand they have a role to play.

I agree completely regarding the limits of SEER and every other standardized efficiency rating I've worked with.  Seasonal and steady state efficiencies are NEVER direct indicators of actual system consumptions, they are merely representations of performance under specific conditions.  That said, they do have a useful time & place which occurs at the beginning of a project, before a more detailed analysis can be made with energy models or otherwise.  SEER may or may not be an inadequate efficiency metric for your specific climate, but that doesn't change what defines your baseline equipment.

If the goal is simply to reduce heating and cooling energy consumptions of your HVAC systems by XX%, and I can't build something resembling the final design for an energy model, I simply can't offer a better answer than "improve your heating and cooling efficiencies by XX%," recognizing this alone will not get you there if your lighting consumptions and envelope performance do not do their part.

A black and white answer to what minimum performance is required of any system for any specific LEED project goal is truly unapproachable until you start the energy model that will determine the results ;).

As it happens however, I can answer Robert's most recent hypothetical almost directly:  I have performed a preliminary study for a building in the vicinity of El Paso, TX using 15 SEER AHU's with energy recovery.  I determined a 30% LEED improvement would have been attainable using an envelope matching 90.1 baseline constructions, but this entailed a roughly 50% LPD reduction (I would have performed the lighting design and can attest this was achievable), and a healthy laundry list of EEM's for mechanical, with a heavy service hot water equipment load helping things along.

So to wrap up, I'd say 15 SEER units absolutely can be one part of a bigger picture achieving a 10% LEED performance rating.

Apologies for the walls of text... sometimes the quick & easy answer is "there aren't any quick and easy answers!"  Hope this discussion is helpful to you and yours in any case!

Robert,
Simple answer is "No" - that is my point - it more than likely never will.  You have to include all of your proposed energy conservation measures that you are likely to apply into a single model with your user and climate/local specific schedules and profiles included to see what the aggregated savings maybe.  You can run multiple models changing only one component to do some sensitivity analysis to see what variables/measures may give you more dramatic changes in total energy consumption, cost, carbon  emissions, indoor comfort, life cycle cost, life cycle assessment, etc.  (which ever your client and you are using as your decision making criteria).
As for the question regarding 10% energy reduction using 15 SEER equipment: I've gotten 10% better energy performance using 90.1 minimum SEER compliant equipment and effecting change in lighting power density, lighting controls, controllable plug loads and better envelope/less infiltration, better ventilation and properly downsizing the mechanical systems.  You do not always have to improve the mechanical efficiency of the HVAC equipment to achieve an energy efficiency improvement target.  It is a whole building analysis that the owner's O&M behavior can have a major impact on.  Conversely, I've had bleeding edge efficiency and complexity in the energy using systems at some facilities and the buildings perform worse than an minimum code compliant building  or a local median EUI when a custodian who knows how to turn things off at night could have done better - when the owner does not understand how the design team intended the building to be operated when they made their analysis.  For example, I just investigated a net zero energy house that was donated to an international non-profit.  It has 22 SEER geothermal heat pumps, an envelope so tight it had no air measurable leakage at 80 pascals, LED lighting, solar water heater, energy recovery ventilator, solar PV, SIPS panel wall system, commercial grade low e windows and a sophisticated energy monitoring system.  It is built right next to a conventionally built house, stick framed, minimum residential code compliant construction with 13 SEER air source heat pumps.  Both are occupied by single mothers with two children.  The net zero house has worse energy performance than the code minimum house almost entirely due to occupant behavior. I personally did not believe you could operate that house such that it would ever consume much energy, but you can.  In this case the owner was not determined until after the house was constructed and did not have a stake in the design and was not trained on the special features of the house when it was offered to her.  Now that she has been educated I can see some reductions - but the house is still falling way short of its goal of net zerobecause the owner is just unwilling to change her lifestyle no matter what the nergy costs are.

I suppose the modeling software and how it treats energy might have something to do with it too (Note to CA and TDV), but for starters the modeling software will look at actual conditions in the particular place where the project is located.  As an absurd case, if there was no cooling needed, an infinite SEER would show no improvement.  SEER is for "typical" and each project is not necessarily typical.  For somewhere with a high cooling demand, SEER should have a greater effect, but cooling is only a small part of the energy budget.

I can appreciate that with "10% better walls, 10% better windows (or how about 10% less windows), 10% lower lighting wattages, 10% more efficient hot water, all compared to the standard, you could get 10% better using a SEER 14.3, but I have never gotten that result.  I suppose that I need to look harder at the other legs on the stool.  For me, I need SEER 17 to get to 10% better in California with a somewhat lopsided stool.  I am curious what experience others have.

The theoretical answer may be "Make everything else use 10% less energy than standard and have a SEER 14.3 AC unit, and you're done" but to be honest, that doesn't ever work for me.

Maybe a better question is; have you ever gotten 10% better than ASHRAE 90.1 with a 15 SEER AC system?  In a real project with real people fighting over costs, etc.?

Robert,
SEER is a seasonal energy efficiency ratio and is unitless.  It is the "cooling output during a typical cooling-season divided by the total electric energy input during the same period": http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_energy_efficiency_ratio.  A unit with 10% or better seasonal cooling energy efficiency over a 13 SEER unit would have a SEER rating of 14.3 or greater (1.1x13) if all other operating parameters were held constant.

I absolutely agree with you, Nick, on achieving 10% better, but all the trades point to the others.  It's kind of comical, actually.

I guess my question on this list could be rephrased, using your approach, as "What SEER is 10% better than SEER 13?"

A very simple way of looking at LEED & energy, which I come back to often for discussions on that level, is to consider a building's performance like a tripod with three important legs:  Lights, Mechanical, and Envelope.  If any of those legs is too short, the tripod falls over.

Building on that analogy, to do 10% better than a LEED baseline, a good starting place is to have at least:
-  10% better lighting (10% lower LPD),
-  10% better HVAC & hot water heating (10% better efficiencies), and
-  10% better envelope (10% more insulation in walls/roof, 10% better windows).
For each of these, you can source the baseline/prescriptive levels from the standard of your choosing.

Overperforming in one area can sometimes make up for underperfomance in another, but with diminishing returns.  Amazing HVAC equipment/design has a harder time shining when you have a poor envelope and/or the lighting designer treats LPD's as a "budget" they have to use up.  For such reasons, it's advisable to always consider building performance in holistic fashion in early/broader discussions.

That's my (simple) take anyway!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED - What does it take?

I know that LEED is way more than just energy, and energy is way more than just equipment, but just for a basis, what SEER and EER do people have to use to get 10% better than ASHRAE 90.1 to qualify for LEED?  I also know that you don't have to use ASHRAE 90.1, but that is what I am doing.

So, what does it take?

My shot - Residential Apartment, individual DX units, 17 SEER and 13 EER in California CZ 12 (Mostly cooling).

   Next?

Great Conversation All,
I'd like to jump back in with a few more thoughts (having to jot them down
quickly - so apologize if not well organized):
First, I believe our energy codes will soon have to go to performance based
criteria if we are going to meet the "net zero energy building" goals
ASHRAE and other organizations have agreed to hit by 2030 for new
construction and major renovations.  I think ASHRAE is possibly on to
something with the bEQ rating which is a rating based on a net zero target
and will help drive us toward performance based codes.  Since the bEQ has
both an "as-designed" component and an "as-operated" component user/owner
behavior will have a large impact on the final outcome - which I believe
will be positive - since an owner will be incented to meet the energy
targets they established in the design phase in order to keep the rating
and, hopefully, keep the value of the property up based on its performance.
 It could be a market based, engineering based way to get us to net zero
energy buildings by allowing us to be creative and innovative.  I'd rather
be given a wish list of things the market wants (including a mandatory
energy target) and a fixed budget and let me be as creative as possible at
providing as many things off the wish list as is possible than be given a
wish list in the form of contract documents then receive bids (variable
cost due to bidders) and have to go through the dreaded value engineering
process where line items from the list are often eliminated without any
economic consideration to the long term effects on the building or its
energy consumption.

The marginal cost for a utility to deliver an additional kWh of capacity
that it does not have/own the generation infrastructure to make that kWh is
almost always more expensive than delivering that kWh from existing
generation capacity whether they purchase it from another company off the
grid or have to build more peaking capacity using something like a gas
turbine.  I'm not sure I totally agree with Vikram on his note about LEED
being based on consumption instead of cost: Appendix G and LEED are focused
on one year's cost rather consumption rather than an efficiency standard
something like a kBtu/sf metric (although they are beginning to track such
numbers in EPA's Portfolio Manager).  That's also why thermal storage can
be used to reduce the annual cost of energy consumption at a building and
actually increase consumption by shifting load to the off peak times of the
local utility to use the utility's base line generation capacity and that
is why demand side management programs and incentives by utilities are so
popular.

A global well connected eGrid could fix a lot of this by allowing excess
baseline generation  capacity at night in the US to say - offset peak load
during the day in the far east (12 hour time difference) and vice versa
(can you imagine the politics and trade policies that would have to be in
place to let that happen?). We would need a good many fewer power plants in
general under this scenario.

Sorry I do not have more time to add more details right now - got to run -
hope the additional comments will generate more discussion.
Thanks,
Dennis

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Reminder: RMESE Meeting January 22
Message-ID: <CAN1ZnDtL3uqKJcEpVG0p9aiyV-kwimiFUmR4wf9sYk6iD98b5g@mail.gmail.com>

Join us *Tuesday, January 22* for the next meeting of the Rocky Mountain
Energy Simulation Engineers (RMESE). Chris Baker will be presenting on
"Minding the Gap".

Register here: http://rockymtnashrae.com/meetinginfo.php?id=33&ts=1355412456

*"Minding the Gap"*

The use of energy modeling to drive design decisions earlier in the design
process has long been recognized as an effective way to increase building
energy performance. With this in mind, several utility-sponsored Design
Assistance programs in the Midwest and Colorado regions expanded their
scope to provide comparative energy analysis of design options as early as
the building programming portion of the design process. These utility
programs attempt to influence decisions that significantly impact the
energy performance of the designed building. To be effective for market
transformation, these programs need to provide incentives for more
energy-efficient decisions that occur in the conceptual stages of design.
To calculate savings in a utility program and provide incentives that can
be defensible, a fair and consistent baseline protocol is needed. Appendix
G to ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-2007 is currently the most robust energy
modeling protocol that can be used by such incentive programs and rating
systems. However, this protocol does not provide adequate baseline criteria
to evaluate early design decisions, such as building shape, glazing and
skylight area and programmatic efficiency. To enable the calculation of
savings and incentives, Appendix G needs to be expanded to provide
additional baseline criteria.

This presentation explores where Appendix G falls short of providing
baseline criteria for decisions made early in the design process, and
proposes changes to Appendix G that would allow these savings to be
captured.

Chris Baker, an Energy Analyst at The Weidt Group, focuses on providing
data and analysis to help design teams understand the energy and
environmental implications of various design options. Since joining The
Weidt Group in 2006, Mr. Baker has consulted on projects totaling more than
5 million square feet, including fifteen LEED Certified projects and
another 17 LEED Registered projects.

Mr. Baker received an MBA from the University of Minnesota and a Bachelor
of Architecture and Bachelor of Science in Architectural Engineering with
an HVAC emphasis from the University of Kansas. He is a Registered
Architect and Professional Engineer.

We will be meeting at *The RMH Group in Lakewood at 6:00 pm on Tuesday,
January 22* for a short presentation, appetizers, and drinks. The RMH Group
is located roughly 1 mile east of NREL at:



The RMH Group, Inc.

12600 W Colfax Avenue

Suite A-260

Lakewood, CO 80215
We are not yet able to offer our presentations as an on-line webinar or
streaming video.  We are looking into it for the future but we're still
just getting RMESE off the ground so it's probably something we will grow
into later.

Hi Joe,

For or purpose of designing the mass of the building at the early
conceptual stage of the design, we are more concerned with the relative
magnitudes of solar radiation. This is not to say that we are entirely not
concerned with the solar radiation values, but that is less of an
importance at this stage.

Since the RMY file shows a skewed radiation-rose different from all the
other files we decided not to use that file for the studies. I also agree
with your point about the location of Sydney. I double checked and it is
near the center of UTC+10: (http://www.timeanddate.com/time/map/)

Regards,
Mostapha

Hello All,

I am in the process of modelling some WSHPs in EE4 which have been rated
using AHRI/ISO 13256-1 standard. Can someone point me to a reference which
explains how to determine the fan power for these units as required by the

NFRC ratings and the Window software historically use composite boundary conditions (convective and LW radiative).  I think they have them split now in the latest version of Window 6/7 though one would have to check the manuals etc.

Historically, an internal film coefficient of hi=8.3 W/m2 oK (sorry but I am Canadian, Australian) or so was assumed which when you do the back of the envelope is about half convective and half LW radiative.  So a lowE coat on the inner facing surface of a window (has to be exposed to air/gas to improve U-Value) would lower the radiative heat transfer coefficient leaving you with 4 or so for convection.  

Its the first time I have seen a lowE coating on a film that can be exposed to atmosphere.  I could be wrong but the Southwall XIR films use spectrally selective coatings or filters within the film raher than on the surface of the film.  We are used to seeing it on glass as a hard or pyrolytic coat on Pilkington k-glass - I am sitting next to a piece in our home study that definitely lowers the U-Value with no air gap ? .  The truly spectrally selective coatings are soft and prone to oxidation if exposed to atmosphere thus why we see them in sealed air cavities.

So if Enerlogic have managed to coat a film that can be retrofitted onto a piece of glass then they have something.  I would be checking what warranty there is on the performance as it could be prone to oxidation or have UV stability issues (a historic problem with older generation retrofit films).

Regards,
Graham

A quick and, but not definitive response.  There are known problems with the RMY files for Australian which I believe are left unresolved at this time as the government ran out of funding to correct the problems.  And yet we have them ratcheting up the energy provisions within our construction code and expecting sensible if not deliverable results from JV3 simulations (the equivalent of a 90.1 energy cost budget simulation)!

So today we still use Test Reference Year (TRY) Files that can be bought from ACADS-BSG in raw data form.  The BIN files on DOE-2.COM are built off of these TRYs.

Aside from that the radiation data itself is unsymmetric in Sydney.  I have not done a definitive analysis but we tend to see clearer mornings in the weather file leading to higher DNI and higher overall global horizontal in the morning half of the hemisphere than the afternoon half.  Over the course of the day our intense sun (10% more radiation or so in a southern hemisphere summer due to the elliptical orbit we have around the sun) leads to evaporation and cloud building up that lowers both DNI and global horizontal with all else equal.  I thought it was a weather file problem years ago but satisfied myself it wasn't in the end.  This wouldn't explain observing the sun rising earlier or later relative to the sunset if you are otherwise in the middle of the time zone...  

Sorry I can't provide more background on the Aussie RMY's but I need to get off to work.

Since these are all "typical year" weather files, they are likely to be different months from different years. Overall, it does seem that the WX is showing more solar than the IWEC or IWEC2, which are quite close.  The larger variation in direct normal is understandable, since all the models (as well as measurements) show that when total goes down, the fraction direct goes down even more.

Weighing in from the ?outside?, I agree very much with Joe on the future of building control systems being based on sensors but I believe sensors augmented with precision, highly localized weather data - forecasts which will drive predictive control, and current and recent condition data for sensor verification and external variables not being measured.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] LEED - What does it take?

I have been following this discussion, not as an engineer or modeler, but as someone interested in the factors influencing the financial return on energy saving products.  My concern is in the same area as Vikram Sami expressed below but even a little deeper.  Vikram rightly notes that energy costs vary from location to location so a unit saved one place is not necessarily comparable to another location.  I would add two other factors that are very important in an energy efficiency decision - rate structure and time of energy saving. The bottom line is that an energy unit saved is based on both  the rate structure and the time of day that negative watt was earned.

 

Rate structure factors such as demand response, peak demand, and off hours rates drive the value of reducing energy usage.  Some utilities offer very low rates at night.  If you have a building element - such as our Phase Change Material or Ice Energy's storage process - that can store energy during the low rate hours; then this energy is available to offset demand during a peak rate periods.  

 

If a product can reduce the energy usage during a high rate period in a high rate location then that energy saved should command a higher value in not only a LEED certifications calculation but in calculating the value in an energy modeling program for ROI.

 

I am not an expert on energy modeling nor do I know about all the models available, so this comment needs to be understood from my product perspective and most likely, my limited knowledge.  It seems to me that most models are driven by weather data.  Weather data and location drive the design of the building shell. A building is built to live and work in.  Efficiently managing the internal environment demands managing energy use for not only the effects from the outside environment but also the comfort and use of its occupants.  I am excited about the future of building control systems based on sensors.  This trend will help solve the problems I noted above but they do more than just save units of energy, they will save energy at the most expensive moments.  

 

As an MBA - not an engineer - the key here is twofold.  How much energy can I save with the package of energy saving options available to me and what is the cost of a unit of energy when I save it.

My two five cents ? adding to the many cents already thrown in the pot. 

 

?       LEED & Appendix G at this point are based on energy cost ? not raw BTUs or carbon. So the relative costs of your fuel mix will have an effect on final scores (in a place where electricity is cheap and heating fuel is not ? you are likely going to have less credit for your SEER rating). I don?t agree with it, but that?s how the system is set up.

?       The effectiveness depends on your baseline energy usage. For example ? if you have a building that has very small HVAC component, even a 50% reduction won?t get you to 10% overall. 

?       LEED addresses consumption and not efficiency (which is a good thing). So you get credit for ?driving less?. Hours that you don?t need to run your HVAC = money in your pocket (the envelope leg of Nick?s tripod analogy). 

?       It also depends on other factors like how you deliver the energy. For example ? using hydronic cooling & heating will likely save you more energy than an all air system with a higher EER on the chiller. Using a waterside economizer goes back to the ?driving less? analogy. Hydronic systems are also less prone to reheat (simultaneous heating & cooling) issues that you have with all air systems. 

 

The way I like to approach LEED projects is to go after the intent of the credits rather than the point ? you?ll be surprised at how often you end up with a higher LEED score when you do. 

 

Apologies to Robert if this doesn?t directly respond to the original question.

Man, every time I start a reply 3 more have come out, haha!  I think we?re all pretty much on the same page though =).  This is largely written in response to Robert?s most recent reply:

 

Applying 10% improvement to lighting/mechanical equipment/envelope is merely a strategy for achieving performance figures in the right ballpark once energy modeling begins.  No more and no less.  I can attest this has worked well for me in the past, but I never meant to imply ?..and you?re done.?  

 

This is just a means of getting the ball rolling and ensuring the important decision makers understand they have a role to play.

 

I agree completely regarding the limits of SEER and every other standardized efficiency rating I?ve worked with.  Seasonal and steady state efficiencies are NEVER direct indicators of actual system consumptions, they are merely representations of performance under specific conditions.  That said, they do have a useful time & place which occurs at the beginning of a project, before a more detailed analysis can be made with energy models or otherwise.  SEER may or may not be an inadequate efficiency metric for your specific climate, but that doesn?t change what defines your baseline equipment. 

 

If the goal is simply to reduce heating and cooling energy consumptions of your HVAC systems by XX%, and I can?t build something resembling the final design for an energy model, I simply can?t offer a better answer than ?improve your heating and cooling efficiencies by XX%,? recognizing this alone will not get you there if your lighting consumptions and envelope performance do not do their part.  

 

A black and white answer to what minimum performance is required of any system for any specific LEED project goal is truly unapproachable until you start the energy model that will determine the results ;). 

 

As it happens however, I can answer Robert?s most recent hypothetical almost directly:  I have performed a preliminary study for a building in the vicinity of El Paso, TX using 15 SEER AHU?s with energy recovery.  I determined a 30% LEED improvement would have been attainable using an envelope matching 90.1 baseline constructions, but this entailed a roughly 50% LPD reduction (I would have performed the lighting design and can attest this was achievable), and a healthy laundry list of EEM?s for mechanical, with a heavy service hot water equipment load helping things along.  

 

So to wrap up, I?d say 15 SEER units absolutely can be one part of a bigger picture achieving a 10% LEED performance rating.

 

Apologies for the walls of text? sometimes the quick & easy answer is ?there aren?t any quick and easy answers!?  Hope this discussion is helpful to you and yours in any case!

Robert,

Simple answer is "No" - that is my point - it more than likely never will.  You have to include all of your proposed energy conservation measures that you are likely to apply into a single model with your user and climate/local specific schedules and profiles included to see what the aggregated savings maybe.  You can run multiple models changing only one component to do some sensitivity analysis to see what variables/measures may give you more dramatic changes in total energy consumption, cost, carbon  emissions, indoor comfort, life cycle cost, life cycle assessment, etc.  (which ever your client and you are using as your decision making criteria).

As for the question regarding 10% energy reduction using 15 SEER equipment: I've gotten 10% better energy performance using 90.1 minimum SEER compliant equipment and effecting change in lighting power density, lighting controls, controllable plug loads and better envelope/less infiltration, better ventilation and properly downsizing the mechanical systems.  You do not always have to improve the mechanical efficiency of the HVAC equipment to achieve an energy efficiency improvement target.  It is a whole building analysis that the owner's O&M behavior can have a major impact on.  Conversely, I've had bleeding edge efficiency and complexity in the energy using systems at some facilities and the buildings perform worse than an minimum code compliant building  or a local median EUI when a custodian who knows how to turn things off at night could have done better - when the owner does not understand how the design team intended the building to be operated when they made their analysis.  For example, I just investigated a net zero energy house that was donated to an international non-profit.  It has 22 SEER geothermal heat pumps, an envelope so tight it had no air measurable leakage at 80 pascals, LED lighting, solar water heater, energy recovery ventilator, solar PV, SIPS panel wall system, commercial grade low e windows and a sophisticated energy monitoring system.  It is built right next to a conventionally built house, stick framed, minimum residential code compliant construction with 13 SEER air source heat pumps.  Both are occupied by single mothers with two children.  The net zero house has worse energy performance than the code minimum house almost entirely due to occupant behavior. I personally did not believe you could operate that house such that it would ever consume much energy, but you can.  In this case the owner was not determined until after the house was constructed and did not have a stake in the design and was not trained on the special features of the house when it was offered to her.  Now that she has been educated I can see some reductions - but the house is still falling way short of its goal of net zerobecause the owner is just unwilling to change her lifestyle no matter what the nergy costs are.

I suppose the modeling software and how it treats energy might have something to do with it too (Note to CA and TDV), but for starters the modeling software will look at actual conditions in the particular place where the project is located.  As an absurd case, if there was no cooling needed, an infinite SEER would show no improvement.  SEER is for "typical" and each project is not necessarily typical.  For somewhere with a high cooling demand, SEER should have a greater effect, but cooling is only a small part of the energy budget.

I can appreciate that with "10% better walls, 10% better windows (or how about 10% less windows), 10% lower lighting wattages, 10% more efficient hot water, all compared to the standard, you could get 10% better using a SEER 14.3, but I have never gotten that result.  I suppose that I need to look harder at the other legs on the stool.  For me, I need SEER 17 to get to 10% better in California with a somewhat lopsided stool.  I am curious what experience others have.

The theoretical answer may be "Make everything else use 10% less energy than standard and have a SEER 14.3 AC unit, and you're done" but to be honest, that doesn't ever work for me.

Maybe a better question is; have you ever gotten 10% better than ASHRAE 90.1 with a 15 SEER AC system?  In a real project with real people fighting over costs, etc.?

  Robert, 

  SEER is a seasonal energy efficiency ratio and is unitless.  It is the "cooling output during a typical cooling-season divided by the total electric energy input during the same period": http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_energy_efficiency_ratio.  A unit with 10% or better seasonal cooling energy efficiency over a 13 SEER unit would have a SEER rating of 14.3 or greater (1.1x13) if all other operating parameters were held constant.  See link for definitions and other references.

  I absolutely agree with you, Nick, on achieving 10% better, but all the trades point to the others.  It's kind of comical, actually.

  I guess my question on this list could be rephrased, using your approach, as "What SEER is 10% better than SEER 13?"

  A very simple way of looking at LEED & energy, which I come back to often for discussions on that level, is to consider a building's performance like a tripod with three important legs:  Lights, Mechanical, and Envelope.  If any of those legs is too short, the tripod falls over.

  Building on that analogy, to do 10% better than a LEED baseline, a good starting place is to have at least:
  -  10% better lighting (10% lower LPD),
  -  10% better HVAC & hot water heating (10% better efficiencies), and
  -  10% better envelope (10% more insulation in walls/roof, 10% better windows).
  For each of these, you can source the baseline/prescriptive levels from the standard of your choosing.

  Overperforming in one area can sometimes make up for underperfomance in another, but with diminishing returns.  Amazing HVAC equipment/design has a harder time shining when you have a poor envelope and/or the lighting designer treats LPD's as a "budget" they have to use up.  For such reasons, it's advisable to always consider building performance in holistic fashion in early/broader discussions.

  That's my (simple) take anyway!

  I know that LEED is way more than just energy, and energy is way more than just equipment, but just for a basis, what SEER and EER do people have to use to get 10% better than ASHRAE 90.1 to qualify for LEED?  I also know that you don't have to use ASHRAE 90.1, but that is what I am doing.

  So, what does it take?

  My shot - Residential Apartment, individual DX units, 17 SEER and 13 EER in California CZ 12 (Mostly cooling).

Graham,

Thanks for the information.  I downloaded the ACADS-BSG weather file and also ran some 
statistics on it.
I also went on the web and within a few minutes found several sources for solar radiation 
in Sydney, which seems
to average between 16-17 megajoules /m2  or 4444-4722 Watts/m2 per day.  If anyone wants 
to devote a few
hours to this, I'm sure one can get quite a good sense of the measured solar radiation in 
Sydney.

I also recalculated the totals from ACADS, IWEC, and IWEC2, and think that Mostapha made a 
mistake on  the
IWEC2 total horizontal,  because what I got was 4519 rather than the 4180 reported by 
Mostapha :

                                                                                ACADS   
IWEC   IWEC2    WX (as calculated by Mostapha)
                                                                                       
(all in W/m2 per day)
                                         Total Horizontal            4386     4526      
4519    4940
                                          DIrect Normal               4442    3979      
3628    4802

Based on what I've seen so far, I would say that the IWEC and IWEC2 solar are in the 
middle of the measured data, the ACADS is somewhat  low, and the WX seems somewhat high.

My fault.  When I recalculated the IWEC2 solar using awk, I got the same numbers as 
Mostapha, rather than the higher number I got using Excel.  So now, it would seem that 
IWEC is right in the middle, ACADS and IWEC2 are low,  and WX is high.

Thank you Joe and Graham for the information.

I'm curious to know where I made the mistake though. Isn't the number equal
to the average of the column L (total diffuse radiation) * 24 hours = 174.15
* 24 hours = 4179.6? Probably I'm missing something here.

Thanks,
Mostapha

Energy Cost Comment-
Working for the Army, we have many similar buildings in many different locations. We once had 2 buildings each in the same climate type, designed the same, but they differed by 5 leed points when it came to energy savings.  When we look into why, it turned out the only difference was utility rates.  

Weather Comment-
What I have seem with a few high performance buildings is that the weather is becoming a very small factor.

Primary office building with a lot of computer equipment, well insulated roof and walls with energy recovery for outside air and a low outside wall to square footage ratio (large cubes.)

Controls Comment-
I also think that controls are one of the most crucial keys to energy savings.  I have toured too many buildings when they were not occupied and the outside air dampers were 100% open.  I don't have a site, but I remember one article that said most buildings could save 30% in energy just by changing how it is controlled.  Less efficient equipment turned off is always more efficient that highly efficient equipment running when it doesn't need to.

Weighing in from the ?outside?, I agree very much with Joe on the future of building control systems being based on sensors but I believe sensors augmented with precision, highly localized weather data - forecasts which will drive predictive control, and current and recent condition data for sensor verification and external variables not being measured.

I have been following this discussion, not as an engineer or modeler, but as someone interested in the factors influencing the financial return on energy saving products.  My concern is in the same area as Vikram Sami expressed below but even a little deeper.  Vikram rightly notes that energy costs vary from location to location so a unit saved one place is not necessarily comparable to another location.  I would add two other factors that are very important in an energy efficiency decision - rate structure and time of energy saving. The bottom line is that an energy unit saved is based on both  the rate structure and the time of day that negative watt was earned.

 

Rate structure factors such as demand response, peak demand, and off hours rates drive the value of reducing energy usage.  Some utilities offer very low rates at night.  If you have a building element - such as our Phase Change Material or Ice Energy's storage process - that can store energy during the low rate hours; then this energy is available to offset demand during a peak rate periods.  

 

If a product can reduce the energy usage during a high rate period in a high rate location then that energy saved should command a higher value in not only a LEED certifications calculation but in calculating the value in an energy modeling program for ROI.

 

I am not an expert on energy modeling nor do I know about all the models available, so this comment needs to be understood from my product perspective and most likely, my limited knowledge.  It seems to me that most models are driven by weather data.  Weather data and location drive the design of the building shell. A building is built to live and work in.  Efficiently managing the internal environment demands managing energy use for not only the effects from the outside environment but also the comfort and use of its occupants.  I am excited about the future of building control systems based on sensors.  This trend will help solve the problems I noted above but they do more than just save units of energy, they will save energy at the most expensive moments.  

 

As an MBA - not an engineer - the key here is twofold.  How much energy can I save with the package of energy saving options available to me and what is the cost of a unit of energy when I save it.

My two five cents ? adding to the many cents already thrown in the pot. 

 

?       LEED & Appendix G at this point are based on energy cost ? not raw BTUs or carbon. So the relative costs of your fuel mix will have an effect on final scores (in a place where electricity is cheap and heating fuel is not ? you are likely going to have less credit for your SEER rating). I don?t agree with it, but that?s how the system is set up.

?       The effectiveness depends on your baseline energy usage. For example ? if you have a building that has very small HVAC component, even a 50% reduction won?t get you to 10% overall. 

?       LEED addresses consumption and not efficiency (which is a good thing). So you get credit for ?driving less?. Hours that you don?t need to run your HVAC = money in your pocket (the envelope leg of Nick?s tripod analogy). 

?       It also depends on other factors like how you deliver the energy. For example ? using hydronic cooling & heating will likely save you more energy than an all air system with a higher EER on the chiller. Using a waterside economizer goes back to the ?driving less? analogy. Hydronic systems are also less prone to reheat (simultaneous heating & cooling) issues that you have with all air systems. 

 

The way I like to approach LEED projects is to go after the intent of the credits rather than the point ? you?ll be surprised at how often you end up with a higher LEED score when you do. 

 

Apologies to Robert if this doesn?t directly respond to the original question.

Man, every time I start a reply 3 more have come out, haha!  I think we?re all pretty much on the same page though =).  This is largely written in response to Robert?s most recent reply:

 

Applying 10% improvement to lighting/mechanical equipment/envelope is merely a strategy for achieving performance figures in the right ballpark once energy modeling begins.  No more and no less.  I can attest this has worked well for me in the past, but I never meant to imply ?..and you?re done.?  

 

This is just a means of getting the ball rolling and ensuring the important decision makers understand they have a role to play.

 

I agree completely regarding the limits of SEER and every other standardized efficiency rating I?ve worked with.  Seasonal and steady state efficiencies are NEVER direct indicators of actual system consumptions, they are merely representations of performance under specific conditions.  That said, they do have a useful time & place which occurs at the beginning of a project, before a more detailed analysis can be made with energy models or otherwise.  SEER may or may not be an inadequate efficiency metric for your specific climate, but that doesn?t change what defines your baseline equipment. 

 

If the goal is simply to reduce heating and cooling energy consumptions of your HVAC systems by XX%, and I can?t build something resembling the final design for an energy model, I simply can?t offer a better answer than ?improve your heating and cooling efficiencies by XX%,? recognizing this alone will not get you there if your lighting consumptions and envelope performance do not do their part.  

 

A black and white answer to what minimum performance is required of any system for any specific LEED project goal is truly unapproachable until you start the energy model that will determine the results ;). 

 

As it happens however, I can answer Robert?s most recent hypothetical almost directly:  I have performed a preliminary study for a building in the vicinity of El Paso, TX using 15 SEER AHU?s with energy recovery.  I determined a 30% LEED improvement would have been attainable using an envelope matching 90.1 baseline constructions, but this entailed a roughly 50% LPD reduction (I would have performed the lighting design and can attest this was achievable), and a healthy laundry list of EEM?s for mechanical, with a heavy service hot water equipment load helping things along.  

 

So to wrap up, I?d say 15 SEER units absolutely can be one part of a bigger picture achieving a 10% LEED performance rating.

 

Apologies for the walls of text? sometimes the quick & easy answer is ?there aren?t any quick and easy answers!?  Hope this discussion is helpful to you and yours in any case!

Robert,

Simple answer is "No" - that is my point - it more than likely never will.  You have to include all of your proposed energy conservation measures that you are likely to apply into a single model with your user and climate/local specific schedules and profiles included to see what the aggregated savings maybe.  You can run multiple models changing only one component to do some sensitivity analysis to see what variables/measures may give you more dramatic changes in total energy consumption, cost, carbon  emissions, indoor comfort, life cycle cost, life cycle assessment, etc.  (which ever your client and you are using as your decision making criteria).

As for the question regarding 10% energy reduction using 15 SEER equipment: I've gotten 10% better energy performance using 90.1 minimum SEER compliant equipment and effecting change in lighting power density, lighting controls, controllable plug loads and better envelope/less infiltration, better ventilation and properly downsizing the mechanical systems.  You do not always have to improve the mechanical efficiency of the HVAC equipment to achieve an energy efficiency improvement target.  It is a whole building analysis that the owner's O&M behavior can have a major impact on.  Conversely, I've had bleeding edge efficiency and complexity in the energy using systems at some facilities and the buildings perform worse than an minimum code compliant building  or a local median EUI when a custodian who knows how to turn things off at night could have done better - when the owner does not understand how the design team intended the building to be operated when they made their analysis.  For example, I just investigated a net zero energy house that was donated to an international non-profit.  It has 22 SEER geothermal heat pumps, an envelope so tight it had no air measurable leakage at 80 pascals, LED lighting, solar water heater, energy recovery ventilator, solar PV, SIPS panel wall system, commercial grade low e windows and a sophisticated energy monitoring system.  It is built right next to a conventionally built house, stick framed, minimum residential code compliant construction with 13 SEER air source heat pumps.  Both are occupied by single mothers with two children.  The net zero house has worse energy performance than the code minimum house almost entirely due to occupant behavior. I personally did not believe you could operate that house such that it would ever consume much energy, but you can.  In this case the owner was not determined until after the house was constructed and did not have a stake in the design and was not trained on the special features of the house when it was offered to her.  Now that she has been educated I can see some reductions - but the house is still falling way short of its goal of net zerobecause the owner is just unwilling to change her lifestyle no matter what the nergy costs are.

I suppose the modeling software and how it treats energy might have something to do with it too (Note to CA and TDV), but for starters the modeling software will look at actual conditions in the particular place where the project is located.  As an absurd case, if there was no cooling needed, an infinite SEER would show no improvement.  SEER is for "typical" and each project is not necessarily typical.  For somewhere with a high cooling demand, SEER should have a greater effect, but cooling is only a small part of the energy budget.

I can appreciate that with "10% better walls, 10% better windows (or how about 10% less windows), 10% lower lighting wattages, 10% more efficient hot water, all compared to the standard, you could get 10% better using a SEER 14.3, but I have never gotten that result.  I suppose that I need to look harder at the other legs on the stool.  For me, I need SEER 17 to get to 10% better in California with a somewhat lopsided stool.  I am curious what experience others have.

The theoretical answer may be "Make everything else use 10% less energy than standard and have a SEER 14.3 AC unit, and you're done" but to be honest, that doesn't ever work for me.

Maybe a better question is; have you ever gotten 10% better than ASHRAE 90.1 with a 15 SEER AC system?  In a real project with real people fighting over costs, etc.?

	Robert, 

	SEER is a seasonal energy efficiency ratio and is unitless.  It is the "cooling output during a typical cooling-season divided by the total electric energy input during the same period": http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_energy_efficiency_ratio.  A unit with 10% or better seasonal cooling energy efficiency over a 13 SEER unit would have a SEER rating of 14.3 or greater (1.1x13) if all other operating parameters were held constant.  See link for definitions and other references.

	A very simple way of looking at LEED & energy, which I come back to often for discussions on that level, is to consider a building's performance like a tripod with three important legs:  Lights, Mechanical, and Envelope.  If any of those legs is too short, the tripod falls over.
	
	Building on that analogy, to do 10% better than a LEED baseline, a good starting place is to have at least:
	-  10% better lighting (10% lower LPD),
	-  10% better HVAC & hot water heating (10% better efficiencies), and
	-  10% better envelope (10% more insulation in walls/roof, 10% better windows).
	For each of these, you can source the baseline/prescriptive levels from the standard of your choosing.
	
	Overperforming in one area can sometimes make up for underperfomance in another, but with diminishing returns.  Amazing HVAC equipment/design has a harder time shining when you have a poor envelope and/or the lighting designer treats LPD's as a "budget" they have to use up.  For such reasons, it's advisable to always consider building performance in holistic fashion in early/broader discussions.
	
	That's my (simple) take anyway!

	So, what does it take?
	
	My shot - Residential Apartment, individual DX units, 17 SEER and 13 EER in California CZ 12 (Mostly cooling).
	
	   Next?

John, you are right on target on all points!
Keep in mind, though, that weather often has a greater impact on the existing buildings that need a lot of help.  They don't have the high performance envelopes and are not as likely to get a "makeover".

Energy Cost Comment-
Working for the Army, we have many similar buildings in many different locations. We once had 2 buildings each in the same climate type, designed the same, but they differed by 5 leed points when it came to energy savings.  When we look into why, it turned out the only difference was utility rates.

Weather Comment-
What I have seem with a few high performance buildings is that the weather is becoming a very small factor.

Primary office building with a lot of computer equipment, well insulated roof and walls with energy recovery for outside air and a low outside wall to square footage ratio (large cubes.)

Controls Comment-
I also think that controls are one of the most crucial keys to energy savings.  I have toured too many buildings when they were not occupied and the outside air dampers were 100% open.  I don't have a site, but I remember one article that said most buildings could save 30% in energy just by changing how it is controlled.  Less efficient equipment turned off is always more efficient that highly efficient equipment running when it doesn't need to.

Weighing in from the ?outside?, I agree very much with Joe on the future of building control systems being based on sensors but I believe sensors augmented with precision, highly localized weather data - forecasts which will drive predictive control, and current and recent condition data for sensor verification and external variables not being measured.

I have been following this discussion, not as an engineer or modeler, but as someone interested in the factors influencing the financial return on energy saving products.  My concern is in the same area as Vikram Sami expressed below but even a little deeper.  Vikram rightly notes that energy costs vary from location to location so a unit saved one place is not necessarily comparable to another location.  I would add two other factors that are very important in an energy efficiency decision - rate structure and time of energy saving. The bottom line is that an energy unit saved is based on both  the rate structure and the time of day that negative watt was earned.



Rate structure factors such as demand response, peak demand, and off hours rates drive the value of reducing energy usage.  Some utilities offer very low rates at night.  If you have a building element - such as our Phase Change Material or Ice Energy's storage process - that can store energy during the low rate hours; then this energy is available to offset demand during a peak rate periods.



If a product can reduce the energy usage during a high rate period in a high rate location then that energy saved should command a higher value in not only a LEED certifications calculation but in calculating the value in an energy modeling program for ROI.



I am not an expert on energy modeling nor do I know about all the models available, so this comment needs to be understood from my product perspective and most likely, my limited knowledge.  It seems to me that most models are driven by weather data.  Weather data and location drive the design of the building shell. A building is built to live and work in.  Efficiently managing the internal environment demands managing energy use for not only the effects from the outside environment but also the comfort and use of its occupants.  I am excited about the future of building control systems based on sensors.  This trend will help solve the problems I noted above but they do more than just save units of energy, they will save energy at the most expensive moments.



As an MBA - not an engineer - the key here is twofold.  How much energy can I save with the package of energy saving options available to me and what is the cost of a unit of energy when I save it.

My two five cents ? adding to the many cents already thrown in the pot.



?       LEED & Appendix G at this point are based on energy cost ? not raw BTUs or carbon. So the relative costs of your fuel mix will have an effect on final scores (in a place where electricity is cheap and heating fuel is not ? you are likely going to have less credit for your SEER rating). I don?t agree with it, but that?s how the system is set up.

?       The effectiveness depends on your baseline energy usage. For example ? if you have a building that has very small HVAC component, even a 50% reduction won?t get you to 10% overall.

?       LEED addresses consumption and not efficiency (which is a good thing). So you get credit for ?driving less?. Hours that you don?t need to run your HVAC = money in your pocket (the envelope leg of Nick?s tripod analogy).

?       It also depends on other factors like how you deliver the energy. For example ? using hydronic cooling & heating will likely save you more energy than an all air system with a higher EER on the chiller. Using a waterside economizer goes back to the ?driving less? analogy. Hydronic systems are also less prone to reheat (simultaneous heating & cooling) issues that you have with all air systems.



The way I like to approach LEED projects is to go after the intent of the credits rather than the point ? you?ll be surprised at how often you end up with a higher LEED score when you do.



Apologies to Robert if this doesn?t directly respond to the original question.

Man, every time I start a reply 3 more have come out, haha!  I think we?re all pretty much on the same page though =).  This is largely written in response to Robert?s most recent reply:



Applying 10% improvement to lighting/mechanical equipment/envelope is merely a strategy for achieving performance figures in the right ballpark once energy modeling begins.  No more and no less.  I can attest this has worked well for me in the past, but I never meant to imply ?..and you?re done.?



This is just a means of getting the ball rolling and ensuring the important decision makers understand they have a role to play.



I agree completely regarding the limits of SEER and every other standardized efficiency rating I?ve worked with.  Seasonal and steady state efficiencies are NEVER direct indicators of actual system consumptions, they are merely representations of performance under specific conditions.  That said, they do have a useful time & place which occurs at the beginning of a project, before a more detailed analysis can be made with energy models or otherwise.  SEER may or may not be an inadequate efficiency metric for your specific climate, but that doesn?t change what defines your baseline equipment.



If the goal is simply to reduce heating and cooling energy consumptions of your HVAC systems by XX%, and I can?t build something resembling the final design for an energy model, I simply can?t offer a better answer than ?improve your heating and cooling efficiencies by XX%,? recognizing this alone will not get you there if your lighting consumptions and envelope performance do not do their part.



A black and white answer to what minimum performance is required of any system for any specific LEED project goal is truly unapproachable until you start the energy model that will determine the results ;).



As it happens however, I can answer Robert?s most recent hypothetical almost directly:  I have performed a preliminary study for a building in the vicinity of El Paso, TX using 15 SEER AHU?s with energy recovery.  I determined a 30% LEED improvement would have been attainable using an envelope matching 90.1 baseline constructions, but this entailed a roughly 50% LPD reduction (I would have performed the lighting design and can attest this was achievable), and a healthy laundry list of EEM?s for mechanical, with a heavy service hot water equipment load helping things along.



So to wrap up, I?d say 15 SEER units absolutely can be one part of a bigger picture achieving a 10% LEED performance rating.



Apologies for the walls of text? sometimes the quick & easy answer is ?there aren?t any quick and easy answers!?  Hope this discussion is helpful to you and yours in any case!

Robert,

Simple answer is "No" - that is my point - it more than likely never will.  You have to include all of your proposed energy conservation measures that you are likely to apply into a single model with your user and climate/local specific schedules and profiles included to see what the aggregated savings maybe.  You can run multiple models changing only one component to do some sensitivity analysis to see what variables/measures may give you more dramatic changes in total energy consumption, cost, carbon  emissions, indoor comfort, life cycle cost, life cycle assessment, etc.  (which ever your client and you are using as your decision making criteria).

As for the question regarding 10% energy reduction using 15 SEER equipment: I've gotten 10% better energy performance using 90.1 minimum SEER compliant equipment and effecting change in lighting power density, lighting controls, controllable plug loads and better envelope/less infiltration, better ventilation and properly downsizing the mechanical systems.  You do not always have to improve the mechanical efficiency of the HVAC equipment to achieve an energy efficiency improvement target.  It is a whole building analysis that the owner's O&M behavior can have a major impact on.  Conversely, I've had bleeding edge efficiency and complexity in the energy using systems at some facilities and the buildings perform worse than an minimum code compliant building  or a local median EUI when a custodian who knows how to turn things off at night could have done better - when the owner does not understand how the design team intended the building to be operated when they made their analysis.  For example, I just investigated a net zero energy house that was donated to an international non-profit.  It has 22 SEER geothermal heat pumps, an envelope so tight it had no air measurable leakage at 80 pascals, LED lighting, solar water heater, energy recovery ventilator, solar PV, SIPS panel wall system, commercial grade low e windows and a sophisticated energy monitoring system.  It is built right next to a conventionally built house, stick framed, minimum residential code compliant construction with 13 SEER air source heat pumps.  Both are occupied by single mothers with two children.  The net zero house has worse energy performance than the code minimum house almost entirely due to occupant behavior. I personally did not believe you could operate that house such that it would ever consume much energy, but you can.  In this case the owner was not determined until after the house was constructed and did not have a stake in the design and was not trained on the special features of the house when it was offered to her.  Now that she has been educated I can see some reductions - but the house is still falling way short of its goal of net zerobecause the owner is just unwilling to change her lifestyle no matter what the nergy costs are.

I suppose the modeling software and how it treats energy might have something to do with it too (Note to CA and TDV), but for starters the modeling software will look at actual conditions in the particular place where the project is located.  As an absurd case, if there was no cooling needed, an infinite SEER would show no improvement.  SEER is for "typical" and each project is not necessarily typical.  For somewhere with a high cooling demand, SEER should have a greater effect, but cooling is only a small part of the energy budget.

I can appreciate that with "10% better walls, 10% better windows (or how about 10% less windows), 10% lower lighting wattages, 10% more efficient hot water, all compared to the standard, you could get 10% better using a SEER 14.3, but I have never gotten that result.  I suppose that I need to look harder at the other legs on the stool.  For me, I need SEER 17 to get to 10% better in California with a somewhat lopsided stool.  I am curious what experience others have.

The theoretical answer may be "Make everything else use 10% less energy than standard and have a SEER 14.3 AC unit, and you're done" but to be honest, that doesn't ever work for me.

Maybe a better question is; have you ever gotten 10% better than ASHRAE 90.1 with a 15 SEER AC system?  In a real project with real people fighting over costs, etc.?

        Robert,

        SEER is a seasonal energy efficiency ratio and is unitless.  It is the "cooling output during a typical cooling-season divided by the total electric energy input during the same period": http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_energy_efficiency_ratio.  A unit with 10% or better seasonal cooling energy efficiency over a 13 SEER unit would have a SEER rating of 14.3 or greater (1.1x13) if all other operating parameters were held constant.  See link for definitions and other references.

        I absolutely agree with you, Nick, on achieving 10% better, but all the trades point to the others.  It's kind of comical, actually.

        I guess my question on this list could be rephrased, using your approach, as "What SEER is 10% better than SEER 13?"

        A very simple way of looking at LEED & energy, which I come back to often for discussions on that level, is to consider a building's performance like a tripod with three important legs:  Lights, Mechanical, and Envelope.  If any of those legs is too short, the tripod falls over.

        Building on that analogy, to do 10% better than a LEED baseline, a good starting place is to have at least:
        -  10% better lighting (10% lower LPD),
        -  10% better HVAC & hot water heating (10% better efficiencies), and
        -  10% better envelope (10% more insulation in walls/roof, 10% better windows).
        For each of these, you can source the baseline/prescriptive levels from the standard of your choosing.

        Overperforming in one area can sometimes make up for underperfomance in another, but with diminishing returns.  Amazing HVAC equipment/design has a harder time shining when you have a poor envelope and/or the lighting designer treats LPD's as a "budget" they have to use up.  For such reasons, it's advisable to always consider building performance in holistic fashion in early/broader discussions.

        That's my (simple) take anyway!

Hi all,
I have been away from this conversation for a couple of days due to a death
in my family.
This conversation is great. I'm not sure we have ever really answered
Roberts original question though.
First - my apologies to Vikram for misquoting his statement about LEED
being cost centric in lieu of consumption focused a couple of days ago. He
is absolutely correct.

I agree with several of the thoughts in this recent thread. Stepping away
from modeling for a few thoughts.  Controls, or lets say operations, are
key. We have some very sophisticated control systems installed in the field
and some pretty slick dashboards and analytic software available to look at
building use, energy efficiency, indoor air quality, indoor comfort, human
behavior and user feedback networks. Some are going so far as to measure
the heart rate and respiration rate of a person in a cubicle and begin to
inform control decisions unknown to the occupant. This is all good stuff.

However, it's my experience that many of the larger control systems rely on
legacy code and programs that are often 20 to 30 years old (nothing
necessarily wrong with that if it works). But what I've seen is the
technology is well beyond most average facility managers training to fully
utilize, it's beyond most of the control technicians installing the systems
skill sets to set up properly (when I commission a control system I often
see where the technician has pulled in literally dozens of legacy, canned
sequences and then blocked or turned off much of the code trying to meet a
specified sequence of operations, gets confused and can't hardly tell what
sequence or logic is being used to control the system at the end of the
day). In most cases the owner does not get properly trained and the
valuable, somewhat self heeling features of a lot of control systems,
alerts and notifications never even get set up.

To bring that back to modeling, much of the modeling software we use for
design cannot model most control sequences we can dream up and most
engineers are still using modeling for load design only - they write a
sequence and expect a control contractor to be able to make it work
- energy models are only being applied when a client or a rating system
require it.

To tie back to John's last comment below - 100% agreement - our local
school district, 150 buildings, 8 million sf, $11 million per year in
utilities has a dedicated energy manager and a very sophisticated facility
management system. They are beginning to save upwards of 10 to 15 percent
just by analyzing utility interval data on their larger, more energy
intensive schools, finding and turning off as much as possible when not
needed. They are doing this without energy efficiency upgrades or control
upgrades. Then they are setting energy targets, recalibrating their control
systems setting up good alerts and notifications in the system to squeeze
everything out of what they have and finally writing a strategic energy
management plan for future construction and upgrades. They are fixing their
problems and turning things off first before buying more bells and
whistles. There is something to be said for simplicity.  It seems to be
working.

To Jame's point - existing buildings are at a disadvantage. With more
efficient lighting and more efficient HVAC equipment I'm seeing plug loads
and water heating use bigger pieces of the pie chart.

Thanks to everyone, and this thread can go as long as we want it to.  
For me, I got three or four main points:

1.    To achieve anything, all systems must achieve the same result.  If 
one doesn't pull its weight, well, the goal is missed.  I had this 
resolved on a two hour telephone call with the lighting engineers on the 
project I was working on when I asked the original question.  This 
helped a lot and got the lighting systems pulling their share of the 
load.  Likewise windows, walls, roofs, and mechanical systems.

2.    My experience with the same project, using Energy Pro for 
modeling, shows that SEER 15 gives about 15% better building results 
than SEER 13, which is to be expected from the math, but unless all the 
systems achieve 15% better, well, you don't make that goal.  SEER 17 
does NOT give 30% better building results. More like 20% better and 
again, all the systems need to pull their weight.  In my climate zone 
(CA central valley), more SEER does not equate linearly to more 
performance.  Ever higher numbers give less marginal improvement.  I 
believe this is also to be expected given the fact that infinite SEER 
doesn't give infinite savings and all savings due to SEER require a load 
to be met.  I still don't have a good handle on this, but I'm getting 
closer.

3.    Controls are key.  I just implemented a pneumatic to DDC changeout 
along with some split systems for critical zones for the purpose of 
shutting down the systems at night and on weekends. Big savings there.  
But if the controls aren't right, well, you get the idea.

4.    Process loads can eat you up.  Shut them down!

5.    Utility rates rule the roost.  If you can use this to your 
advantage, it can be a big advantage.


Great conversation, folks.  Thanks for taking the time to think and reply...


Cheers from warming California - No frost this morning.  Are you jealous?

Message-ID: <CAHA4r_kpMpAfuxVrH1t-aJR7_D22bmfJMjZKwhxUvLyZTv1GHg@mail.gmail.com>

I've ALWAYS avoided predictive modeling (telling a client your energy usage
will be below X) as I've been scared. Now I'm pretty deep into a project
performing Green Star energy modeling and my client has popped the question.

We've discussed "why it is hard" and the big three un-knowns: Infiltration,
Occupant behavior!!, and Actual Weather. They still want me to go forward
and are willing to put a bunch of caviates and an agreed margin on the
results.

This is an old 1930's building 200,000 sq ft with original metal window
frames (single pane) that will not be replaced (heritage). We're insulating
the roof and basement ceiling and a completely new HVAC system. Is there a
standard process I can follow or specific suggestions the community could
offer?

So far my idea is to try and guesstimate infiltration, box in comfort
behavior with lease agreements and a survey, and put some margin on weather.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] About baseline systems in LEED eac 1.3 modeling for a
	system with a heated network in AHU and Electric in FCU
Message-ID: <95F0356A0810C44AB56ADD48FA44184101C39E04@greengo>

Hi all ;

 

I have a question concerning LEED eac 1.3, simulation.

 

I have a renovation project of an 7th floor building of more than 150
000 ft2 in which the HVAC system is composed of an AHU heated/cooled by
a heating and a cooling urban network. The prehated/precooled air then
goes into fan coil unit batteries of the FCU which are cooled by the
cooling network BUT the heating batteries in the FCU are electrical (not
heated by the heating network). By looking into the Tables 3.1.1.A and
table G3.1.1.B  from ASHRAE standard 90.1-2007 I can't conclude if my
baseline system is 7  or 8. So that is my question, based in your
experience, baseline system is 7 or system 8?

 

Thanks in advance for any advice on this,

 

Regards

All:

Forwarding a message to the list-serve.... The Sim-EB software is distributed free-of-charge.

(Note:  If you don't currently include Sim-EB as a simulation weapon in your arsenal, you might consider giving it a look. For working with existing buildings that have operational data, Sim-EB contains a wicked powerful module for digesting user-defined generic high resolution metered data and performing cluster analysis against it. The results is a suggested patchwork of 24-hour schedule definitions representing the data, which can then be transformed into realistic, representative data-driven schedules for 8760 model input.  This is only one of Sim-EB's many innovative features, and it does include documentation.)

All the Best,

Get utility bills (if you can), or Use Energy Star or CBECs for a reference building (CBECs median may be higher than a 1930 building !); based on these, you can present a range between 'simulated' savings and 'estimated' savings.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Energy Model from Green Star (LEED) to predictive model

I've ALWAYS avoided predictive modeling (telling a client your energy usage will be below X) as I've been scared. Now I'm pretty deep into a project performing Green Star energy modeling and my client has popped the question.

We've discussed "why it is hard" and the big three un-knowns: Infiltration, Occupant behavior!!, and Actual Weather. They still want me to go forward and are willing to put a bunch of caviates and an agreed margin on the results.

This is an old 1930's building 200,000 sq ft with original metal window frames (single pane) that will not be replaced (heritage). We're insulating the roof and basement ceiling and a completely new HVAC system. Is there a standard process I can follow or specific suggestions the community could offer?

So far my idea is to try and guesstimate infiltration, box in comfort behavior with lease agreements and a survey, and put some margin on weather.

I've been getting within 10% without calibration on the last five or six
buildings I've done where I've tracked the bills afterwards.  The key is
to be thorough and careful.  If you're not getting reasonably close, how
can you justify your recommendations for energy efficiency measures?

Dear Colleagues:

Please be reminded of the deadline of 31 January for nominations for the IBPSA Awards.  The Board of IBPSA is seeking nominations for Awards to be presented at Building Simulation 2013, IBPSA's 13th biennial conference, in Chambery, France from August 26 to 28, 2013. We would like as many nominations as possible, so please contact me to discuss a possible nomination if required.

Best regards,
Pieter de Wilde


-----------------------------------------------------------------------



IBPSA Awards
The International Building Performance Simulation Association (IBPSA) makes three awards for outstanding work in the building performance simulation field. These awards are made on a biennial basis at each Building Simulation Conference, providing there is a qualified candidate.  In order to allow the awardees time to plan to attend, it is time to consider nominations for the up-coming conference in 2013.

The three categories awarded are:

IBPSA Award for Distinguished Service to Building Simulation
This award recognizes an individual who has a distinguished record of contributions to the field of building performance simulation, over a long period. The award consists of a certificate and $500 (US).

IBPSA Outstanding Young Contributor Award
This award recognizes an individual at the beginning of their career who has demonstrated potential for significant contributions to the field of building simulation. The award consists of a certificate and $500 (US).

IBPSA Outstanding Practice Award
This award recognizes and individual, group or firm, who has made significant contributions to the effective application and/or advancement of building simulation in practice. The award consists of a certificate and $US500.


Nominations for awards MUST be made by an independent third party.

Nominations for the Distinguished Service Award should include a brief CV which gives the history of involvement with building performance simulation, publications etc., and a summary of the nominee?s specific contribution to the field of building performance simulation ? e.g. in the development/ contribution to development of building performance simulation tools or in furthering knowledge in the field of application of building performance simulation, etc.

Nominations for the IBPSA Outstanding Young Contributor Award should include a brief CV, which gives a summary of the individual's contributions to the field of building performance simulation, their publications etc., and an assessment of the potential for future contributions arising from the individual.

Nominations for the Outstanding Practice Award should be accompanied by a summary of the individual's, group's or firm's contributions to the field of building performance simulation in practice and an assessment of the significance of these contributions.

Submission Deadline and Details

Deadline - 31 January 2013
Submit to - Nominations should be sent in the first instance to Pieter de Wilde, Chair of the Awards Committee (pieter.dewilde at plymouth.ac.uk) by a closing date of the 31st January 2013.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Student Travel Awards ? Supporting students to attend BS2013
Travel to IBPSA Conferences can be an expensive business ? especially for students. In order to assist as many students as possible to participate in BS 2013 in Chambray, France, IBPSA will grant a number of travel awards of up to 1000USD to students presenting papers. The number of places is limited to a maximum of 5 grants and as a result is highly competitive.

The selection committee bases its decisions upon the following selection criteria:

?           overall quality of the paper;

?           relevance of contribution to the field of and/or furthering the effective application of building simulation;

?           need for financial assistance, evidenced in a letter of recommendation from the student?s supervisor/ advisor of studies (must be on university letterhead).


To be eligible, the student must be:

?           enrolled in a graduate programme related to building simulation at the time of the conference; AND

?           the thesis project must be directly related to building simulation.

Applications MUST be supported by a letter of recommendation from the student?s supervisor/ advisor of studies. Applications for the award must be made by 31 January, 2013 via e-mail to
pieter.dewilde at plymouth.ac.uk. The subject heading of the e-mail should be "Student Travel Award - paper XXX" where XXX is the three-digit reference number for your paper.
The e-mail application must include the following:
       The student's name;
       The name of the programme, department, faculty, and university;
       The title of the PhD or Master's research;
       The name of the student's supervisor(s)/ advisor(s);
       A scanned version of the faculty recommendation letter on university letterhead in PDF format. (Note that the original letter must be presented to the Conference Secretariat at the conference).

The selection committee will base its decision upon a review of the final manuscripts. Therefore, to be eligible the student MUST submit the paper by the full paper deadline of 31 January, 2013.
Nominations should be sent in the first instance to Pieter de Wilde as representative of the Awards Committee (pieter.dewilde at plymouth.ac.uk) by the closing date of the 31st January 2013.

We would like as many nominations as possible, so please contact me to discuss a possible nomination if required.

Payment will be made either to the academic department before the conference or directly to the student at the conference.

Best regards,

Pieter de Wilde

I don't believe there can be any hard rules about the percentage of 
error when calibrating a model.  The margin of error is proportional 
to the amount of information available.  The rest is engineering and 
experience.  Attached is a typical report we use to illustrate how 
close the calibration is.

This particular project is a community centre, pool, with an arena 
adjacent for heat exchange.  A tricky one.

The Building Technology Program at MIT and IBPSA Boston are pleased to announce a presentation by Professor Malcolm Cook (Loughborough University) on January 31st at  noon EST in the Long Lounge (building 7 room 431) at MIT (http://whereis.mit.edu/). Everyone is welcome.

Christoph


Low Energy Buildings: CFD Techniques for Natural Ventilation and Thermal Comfort Prediction
Malcolm's presentation will cover both his research and consultancy activities. This will cover the work he has undertaken during his time spent working with architects on low energy building design, with a particular focus on natural ventilation and passive cooling strategies, and the role computer simulation can play in this design process. Malcolm will talk about the simulation techniques employed, as well as the innovative passive design principles that have led to some of the UK's most energy efficient buildings. In addition to UK building projects, the talk but will include work Malcolm completed as part of the design of the LEED Gold award winning Harm A. Weber Academic Center at Judson University, in Elgin, near Chicago. This building, which comprises office and library space, employs a hybrid ventilation and cooling strategy which exploits the maximum benefit from natural ventilation before reverting to air-conditioning during the harsh winter and peak summer months. Malcolm will also talk about recent research projects, including his work on Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of unsteady flows in naturally ventilated buildings and the development of a new simulation system which couples CFD with a model of human physiology and thermal comfort.

About the speaker:

Malcolm Cook is Professor of Building Performance Analysis at Loughborough University. He is based in the Building Energy Research Group in the School of Civil and Building Engineering and leads their work in the area of ventilation modeling and low energy building design. He obtained his first degree from Manchester University (UK) in Mathematics and completed his PhD in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling of buoyancy-driven natural ventilation at De Montfort University (Leicester, UK). He has worked on research projects funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, the Department of Health and the European Union. He has completed many consultancy projects for a wide range of clients worldwide which have included design and simulation work for health care buildings, schools and modern library buildings. His work is published in over 70 refereed conference and journal papers and has contributed to awards for innovative building design, including the RIBA presidents gold medal for practice-based architecture (2007), the CIBSE environmental initiative of the year award (2006) and a LEED Gold rated Academic Center for Judson College, IL (2008). Malcolm is a member of the CIBSE Natural Ventilation group, vice-chairman of the CIBSE Building Simulation group and chairman of the England affiliate of the International Building Performance Simulation Association.

Nice graphs, Chris!  Even nicer calibration!
Random comment regarding % deviation for an individual month: Natural gas consumption often goes to near-zero in summer months.  This sometimes makes any deviation from the actual usage a very large number, which in reality may be a tiny fraction of total use.  There's no simple solution for this; it's not worth worrying about the deviation because it's so small a fraction of overall use, but it looks really bad to non-technical readers.  I've been reporting R-squared values calculated from the monthly deviation.  Not perfect, but it places the focus on the overall month-by-month match instead of a single month.

Morgan, you apparently work with excellent commissioning agents and very responsible owner / building managers!  10% sounds too good to be true.

I don't believe there can be any hard rules about the percentage of error when calibrating a model.  The margin of error is proportional to the amount of information available.  The rest is engineering and experience.  Attached is a typical report we use to illustrate how close the calibration is.

This particular project is a community centre, pool, with an arena adjacent for heat exchange.  A tricky one.

I've been getting within 10% without calibration on the last five or six buildings I've done where I've tracked the bills afterwards.  The key is to be thorough and careful.  If you're not getting reasonably close, how can you justify your recommendations for energy efficiency measures?

I've ALWAYS avoided predictive modeling (telling a client your energy usage will be below X) as I've been scared. Now I'm pretty deep into a project performing Green Star energy modeling and my client has popped the question.

We've discussed "why it is hard" and the big three un-knowns: Infiltration, Occupant behavior!!, and Actual Weather. They still want me to go forward and are willing to put a bunch of caviates and an agreed margin on the results.

This is an old 1930's building 200,000 sq ft with original metal window frames (single pane) that will not be replaced (heritage). We're insulating the roof and basement ceiling and a completely new HVAC system. Is there a standard process I can follow or specific suggestions the community could offer?

So far my idea is to try and guesstimate infiltration, box in comfort behavior with lease agreements and a survey, and put some margin on weather.

Morgan - 10% is pretty damn close - well done!

That being said - I would like to respond to the second part of your email. Personally I think it is possible to be slightly inaccurate, but still correct.

In my experience it is when you are in the early stages (when there is a huge margin of error) that the modeling is actually at its most useful. Very often it's the early on normative modeling that leads to good design decisions. For example when modeling a VAV system versus a chilled beam system, I might not have the exact BTU number, but if I can get the usage patterns appropriately represented (cooling, heating, fans & reheat) then the result might not be 'accurate', but correct. Your overall numbers might go up and down with occupancy and weather, but the decision still remains a good one. This is where having the experience and the backing of a good database of comparable buildings is invaluable. CBECS is good for overall usage, but it's even better to be able to look at how the BTUs are spent over the year. Investing the time to collect utility bills for your building type is worth a lot.

Often we worry about the accuracy of our results to the nth degree before making recommendations, but by the time we come up with the magic number its too late - the design has morphed, or been finalized so your numbers are either outdated or redundant (in some cases both).

I don't worry too much about the monthy deviation.  It is one more 
indicator to use to help understand the differences between the model 
and actual bills.

Those graphs are part of an Excel workbook that is used to adjust the 
model characteristics, shells out to run the model, then sucks the 
hourly results back into the workbook.  It is a very fast cycle - 
review, adjust run the model and review again.  No "hand work" to 
extrac the results or to adjust the model.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] SEER and Fan Energy
Message-ID: <510932B7.1000704@wichert.org>

This forum has discussed fan energy before, and since that time I have 
grappled with the concept of fan power, specifically how to avoid double 
counting fan power since even indoor fans are included in SEER ratings.

I suppose that I should start by confirming that indoor supply and 
return fans are included in SEER ratings.  I have read the DOE 49 CFR 
Pt. 430, Subpt. B, App. M UNIFORM TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING THE ENERGY 
CONSUMPTION OF CENTRAL AIR CONDITIONERS AND HEAT PUMPS.  It seems clear 
in that method that indoor fans are included in the power and energy 
calculations.  If not, please let me know what I am missing.

OK, if indoor supply and return fans are included in the SEER rating, 
then why would we put additional fan energy into our calculations?  Does 
EQuest, EnergyPro, E+, and all the rest do some math to subtract this 
out, and if so, how is that done?

Sorry for the basic question, but I have thought about this a lot and 
haven't reached a comfortable solution.  At one point I thought that the 
SEER calculation did not account for indoor fans, but I now find that to 
be wrong.


Your thoughts are appreciated.

Hey Morgan:

 

Does your data include years 3 to 6 after construction?  It would be great
to see if usage is in line with predictions after real work use of the
building for a while.  What type and size of buildings were they in what
geography?

 

Thanks,

 

Andy

In my experience it is when you are in the early stages (when there is a
huge margin of error) that the modeling is actually at its most useful. Very
often it's the early on normative modeling that leads to good design
decisions. For example when modeling a VAV system versus a chilled beam
system, I might not have the exact BTU number, but if I can get the usage
patterns appropriately represented (cooling, heating, fans & reheat) then
the result might not be 'accurate', but correct. Your overall numbers might
go up and down with occupancy and weather, but the decision still remains a
good one. This is where having the experience and the backing of a good
database of comparable buildings is invaluable. CBECS is good for overall
usage, but it's even better to be able to look at how the BTUs are spent
over the year. Investing the time to collect utility bills for your building
type is worth a lot. 

 

Often we worry about the accuracy of our results to the nth degree before
making recommendations, but by the time we come up with the magic number its
too late - the design has morphed, or been finalized so your numbers are
either outdated or redundant (in some cases both).

I've been getting within 10% without calibration on the last five or six
buildings I've done where I've tracked the bills afterwards.  The key is to
be thorough and careful.  If you're not getting reasonably close, how can
you justify your recommendations for energy efficiency measures?

Get utility bills (if you can), or Use Energy Star or CBECs for a reference
building (CBECs median may be higher than a 1930 building !); based on
these, you can present a range between 'simulated' savings and 'estimated'
savings.

I've ALWAYS avoided predictive modeling (telling a client your energy usage
will be below X) as I've been scared. Now I'm pretty deep into a project
performing Green Star energy modeling and my client has popped the question.

 

We've discussed "why it is hard" and the big three un-knowns: Infiltration,
Occupant behavior!!, and Actual Weather. They still want me to go forward
and are willing to put a bunch of caviates and an agreed margin on the
results. 

 

This is an old 1930's building 200,000 sq ft with original metal window
frames (single pane) that will not be replaced (heritage). We're insulating
the roof and basement ceiling and a completely new HVAC system. Is there a
standard process I can follow or specific suggestions the community could
offer?

 

So far my idea is to try and guesstimate infiltration, box in comfort
behavior with lease agreements and a survey, and put some margin on weather.

Dear All:

I have had several request to extend the deadline for nominations to the IBPSA Student Travel Awards. In order to accomodate those still working on their papers, but also taking into account practical constraints at my own end, the deadline will be extended to Thursday 14 February 2013.
All other details remain as posted. As a reminder, the earlier call for nominations is copied below.

Best regards,
Pieter de Wilde



-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Student Travel Awards ? Supporting students to attend BS2013
Travel to IBPSA Conferences can be an expensive business ? especially for students. In order to assist as many students as possible to participate in BS 2013 in Chambray, France, IBPSA will grant a number of travel awards of up to 1000USD to students presenting papers. The number of places is limited to a maximum of 5 grants and as a result is highly competitive.

The selection committee bases its decisions upon the following selection criteria:

?           overall quality of the paper;

?           relevance of contribution to the field of and/or furthering the effective application of building simulation;

?           need for financial assistance, evidenced in a letter of recommendation from the student?s supervisor/ advisor of studies (must be on university letterhead).


To be eligible, the student must be:

?           enrolled in a graduate programme related to building simulation at the time of the conference; AND

?           the thesis project must be directly related to building simulation.

Applications MUST be supported by a letter of recommendation from the student?s supervisor/ advisor of studies. Applications for the award must be made by Thursday 14 February, 2013 via e-mail to
pieter.dewilde at plymouth.ac.uk. The subject heading of the e-mail should be "Student Travel Award - paper XXX" where XXX is the three-digit reference number for your paper.
The e-mail application must include the following:
       The student's name;
       The name of the programme, department, faculty, and university;
       The title of the PhD or Master's research;
       The name of the student's supervisor(s)/ advisor(s);
       A scanned version of the faculty recommendation letter on university letterhead in PDF format. (Note that the original letter must be presented to the Conference Secretariat at the conference).

The selection committee will base its decision upon a review of the final manuscripts. Therefore, to be eligible the student MUST submit the paper by the full paper deadline.
Nominations should be sent in the first instance to Pieter de Wilde as representative of the Awards Committee (pieter.dewilde at plymouth.ac.uk) by the closing date of the 14 February 2013.

We would like as many nominations as possible, so please contact me to discuss a possible nomination if required.

Payment will be made either to the academic department before the conference or directly to the student at the conference.

Best regards,

Pieter de Wilde

Robert, I don?t know if I understood your question; If I did this is my
opinion: In some cases Indoor fans are included in SEER (E.g. Rooftop).
Since you are modelling fans and Refrigeration cycle efficiency separately,
you need to subtract this energy from the SEER calculation. On the other
hand, additional fan power is related to the baseline for 90.1, and its
additional fan power your Baseline will use so that certain beneficial
aspects of the proposed design or equipment (eg. Merv 13 filter) are not
excluded from the project because of energy increase.

In *Energypro* you model the rooftop and you have inputs for Cooling

That makes sense, Glenn.  So it's a manual adjustment to the EIR.  In 
Energy Pro, which I use a lot, that can be done by using the 
"Compressor/Condenser Power" option and then adding the fan power in 
separately, but only for systems over five tons.  Smaller systems are 
stuck with SEER.

I think the problem I'm facing is that Energy Pro uses SEER for small 
systems, not EER/EIR.

If I understand the quandary you are referring to packaged systems where the fan energy is included in the package. In eQUEST - if you select the EER rating (or SEER rating) in the wizard, then its my understanding that the program does this automatically for you. However, if you are using the 90.1 methodology, then you probably want to go beyond the wizard. I developed the attached spreadsheet to parse out the energy by fan and cooling - feel free to use it. I would appreciate feedback from anyone willing to check my math and methodology.

I like some of Doug's points around bounding an assumption that is uncertain rather than arguing the exact assumption which if you are really lucky may be close to reality.

Books are probably a reasonably good insulator as they are cellulose and would have fine air gaps around them and possibly between the pages that act as an insulant so it gets back to the comment on 'fast' mass.  I think the CIBSE methods define something called thermal admittance as the ratio of conductivity to specific heat capacity.  What that means is a material can be heavy, but if it has a low conductivity or maybe finished with an insulative layer (think rubber backed carpet on concrete) then the ability for a material to absorb and release heat is diminished - the mass is no longer in close thermal contact.

I had the pleasure (or displeasure in the early stages) of diagnosing and rectifying a thermal comfort problem years ago where a new direct stick carpet was applied to a ground level slab that sat above a naturally ventilated carpark in a location that had an ambient winter design condition of 3C.  The slab was not fully insulated below so became quite cool in places where insulation was missing.  By our calcs (Therm and IES calibrated with an IR gun) the absence of a backing on the carpet resulted in the floor surface temperature being 1-2C cooler.  This was material from a radiant temperature asymmetry point of view but also in cooling low level air that resulted in an unacceptable dry bulb gradient.  We made the insulation continuous and the problem was solved but it was a real lesson in close coupling (fast) of thermal mass versus something that has less of an impact on the loads and thus temperatures.

So it does depend and you have to use engineering judgement, it isn't just the weight, it is how closely coupled (fast or slow ?) the mass is to the space.

My personal experience in modeling residential models is that they always lag more than you expect, so I've regularly responded by jacking up the internal mass. I certainly can fit metered HVAC data a lot better when I add mass beyond what the BABM suggests. I've guessed that's because my partitions don't quite match the amount of mass we're interacting with.

Interesting topic, I look forward to getting my 2013 Fundamentals.

As we monitor more and more buildings in Australia, we are finding they are less dry bulb sensitive and more dew point or enthalpy sensitive.  This is a result of internal load dropping (lights as low as 5 W/m2 in offices and laptops with LED backlit screens at the docking stations), glass and facade technology improving, water-cooled cooling COPs being higher when drier (CW reset), ventilation rates increasing (higher ventilation loads), and supply air flow rates dropping (lower loads, more water based systems, lower design off-coil temps).  The latter two effects mean less % modulation of economy cycles from minimum outdoor air to full outside air ? 

So for me as global warming plays out it will be interesting to see how dew point extremes look relative to dry bulb extremes.  With the oceans warming, there will be more evaporation and storms ? .  A colleague informed me that Mackay in northern Queensland (near the Whitsundays and southern edge of the Great Barrier reef) recorded its highest ever dew point temperature on Tuesday at 28.3C with a coincident dry bulb of 32.8C - that's 24.7 g/kg of moisture!

I am not sure what florida's conditions are like, but for us that is very very humid.  Is there a scenario where the dry bulb extremes don't look that bad, but the added moisture in the air is where we get hit?  Most coils will increase their duty as on-coil wet bulb / dew point increases but at a point the cooling plant won't cope particularly with ambient wet bulb rising thus driving CW temperatures up.  So the traditional loads calculations may be a small issue, but the ventilation load and cooling COP could be far greater issues?

Beyond the paper quoted in another thread that Dru has written, are there other people out there looking at the dew point / moisture issue?  kind of like global humidification rather than global warming ?

Regards,
Graham

There are some differences, however, owing to a more recent period of record (generally 1986-2010 versus 1982-2006). For example, when compared to the 2009 edition, 99.6% heating dry-bulb temperatures have increased by 0.31?F (0.17?C) on average, and 0.4% cooling dry-bulb temperatures have increased by 0.18?F (0.10?C) on average. Similar trends are observed for other design temperatures. The root mean square differences are 0.74?F (0.41?C) for the 99.6% heating dry-bulb values and 0.70?F (0.39?C) for 0.4% cooling dry-bulb. The increases noted here are generally consistent with the discussion in the section on Impacts of Climate Change.

Vikram,

 

I agree with your assessment of the way eQUEST deals with packaged
systems fan energy and cooling efficiency through the wizard.  I always
end up using the detailed interface instead though.

 

Thanks for sending the spreadsheet.  I did look at it and made a few
edits that I will describe below.  I would also appreciate any feedback
from anyone.

 

*         I edited the lookup table to find the next size up motor hp
based on bhp; this is to find the motor efficiency only

*         I used different fan cfm for the example units you listed (400
cfm/ton)

*         I changed some of the units of measure to kW instead of Watts
(just personal preference)

*         The main change I made was to deal with fan heat.  Rated
capacity and efficiency are based on total input power and net cooling
output.  So in order to deal with the fan separately we need to subtract
the fan input electricity from the unit electricity input (as was done),
but we also need to subtract the fan heat from the net cooling capacity
to arrive at the gross cooling capacity.  The gross EER and EIR are then
calculated with fan input and heat removed.  After eQUEST adds the fan
input electricity and fan heat then you end up with the rated efficiency
(if you're at rated conditions).  I added columns related to fan heat
and adjusted the EER and EIR equations.  You can change Fan Heat Frac.
To zero (as if the fan motor is outside of the unit) to see the impact.

If I understand the quandary you are referring to packaged systems where
the fan energy is included in the package. In eQUEST - if you select the
EER rating (or SEER rating) in the wizard, then its my understanding
that the program does this automatically for you. However, if you are
using the 90.1 methodology, then you probably want to go beyond the
wizard. I developed the attached spreadsheet to parse out the energy by
fan and cooling - feel free to use it. I would appreciate feedback from
anyone willing to check my math and methodology.

That makes sense, Glenn.  So it's a manual adjustment to the EIR.  In
Energy Pro, which I use a lot, that can be done by using the
"Compressor/Condenser Power" option and then adding the fan power in
separately, but only for systems over five tons.  Smaller systems are
stuck with SEER.

 

I think the problem I'm facing is that Energy Pro uses SEER for small
systems, not EER/EIR.

The testing and calculations for SEER include a small amount of supply air fan heat.

Suggest reviewing AHRI Standard 210/240-2008, particularly Table 11 on page 20 (same as Table 2 in 10 CFR Part 430 which is shown further down in AHRI 210/240-2008 on page 56).

http://www.ahrinet.org/search+standards.aspx

For example, for a 4-ton cooling system the minimum external static pressure for testing is only 0.2 in. H2O.   In real systems installed in the field, the external pressure drop due to ductwork, etc. is typically much higher that this test value.  That is why its typically best to subtract the fan power and enter "gross" cooling capacity in the software, and then model fan power separately using more reasonable external static pressures than those used for lab testing to support the SEER calculations.
