Hello,

 

I am having difficulty converting the weather file for Calgary, Canada to
run with DOE-2.1E. I downloaded the .bin extension file for Calgary from
www.doe2.com <http://www.doe2.com/>  but it does not seem to work. 

 

Does anyone know how we can convert this file to a format that will run with
DOE-2.1E or is there another site where I can access weather data for
Canada.

 

Thanks in advance,

Can someone refresh my memory on importing a W5 file into eQUEST.  I exported the .txt file from Window 5 and placed it in the "Window" folder in the eQUEST directory.

 

When I create a new glass type code in eQUEST, how do I reference it so that it reads from that file?

 

Thank you!

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Simplied windows and glass libraries

 

A further clarification regarding modeling of whole-window U-Factor in eQuest:

A closer look (confirmed by DOE-2 and Window5 documentation) reveals that eQuest/DOE-2 does not reference the frame information in the DOE-2 report generated by LBL Window5. In fact, the center-of-glass and "overall" U-values indicated in the DOE-2 report from Window5 are the same (both are COG values). 

DOE-2 calculates the overall U-Value as part of the hourly simulation based on the frame width, conductance, and spacer type specified in eQuest. Therefore, while you should still use the DOE-2 report from Window5 to provide eQuest with the optical data for appropriate calculation of SHGC per angle of incidence, you will still need to enter the frame width, U-value, and edge spacer type in eQuest---assuming you've modeled the actual dimensions of the fenestration. If you've lumped windows together into long strips on each fa?ade and want the overall U-value to be at least reasonably accurate, you'll need to add frame width for each window so that the glass-to-frame area will be representative of the actual design.

A point of clarification about WINDOW 5 and DOE2 files -- it is not possible to use THERM files for export to the DOE2 file that WINDOW 5 makes. So the method below, using the generic frame choices that come with WINDOW 5, is probably the most straightforward way to create the window for DOE2.

Kevin,

 

There is a method using LBL Window program that get the U-Factor for the actual frame into the DOE-2 report without requiring you to get the frame/mullion details and then model this in Therm:

 

First, based on selection of the actual glass from the international glazing database, do the center-of glass calculation for the glazing unit within that part of Window5. Then use the U-Factor charts for the frame/mullion system(s) you plan to use or are considering (provided by most supplies of curtain wall systems, etc.) to determine what the glazing system U-factor should be for the appropriate ratio of glazed area to total area including frame. Then return to Window5 and match the system U-Factor from this chart by copying and modifying properties for the closest available frame type/material in the Window5 frame library, checking the Total Window Results when combined with your glazing unit. When, given the same glass-to-frame area ratio, this result matches the one from the system U-Factor chart for the frame/mullion system, you can then create the DOE-2 report from Window5 that you will reference in eQuest. Thus you will have the angular optical data for the correct SHGC at each angle of incidence and also an appropriate system U-Factor without having to actually model the frame. This is particularly valuable if you are weighing a range of frame systems with various insulating properties that also force or enable different glazing units (i.e., they have a different maximum glazing pocket) and you want to see the difference in the whole-building model.

 

Cheers,

Timothy

Kevin,

 

The best way to accurately model windows is with WINDOW and THERM software (windows.lbl.gov).  These tools are also used for NFRC (National Fenestration Rating Council) certifications.  However, you will need all of the details of frame and glazing design to be able to utilize these tools.  WINDOW program is used to model glazing system and THERM program is used to model frame and edge of glass sections.  The whole product is then assembled again in WINDOW program, so WINDOW has dual role.  While WINDOW program is easy to learn and can be accomplished in half a day, THERM program requires 2-3 days of training for novice users.  Several companies offer training and our company (www.designbuildersoftware.com) is one of them.  WINDOW program creates DOE2 report file, which can be used with DOE 2.2 to assign windows.  That provides the most accurate way to model windows energy performance in a building.

 

If you don't have all of the details and wish to get estimated performance, you can use one of the predefined windows in DOE 2.2, closest to what you have.  You should not use simplified way (i.e., by assigning simple U-factor, SHGC and VT as single number), because that produces gross errors.  EnergyPlus program, which is newer generation energy simulation engine from DOE does not even have an option to specify windows and doors that way.  You have to have WINDOW EnergyPlus report file (equivalent to DOE2 report file) or use one of predefined windows in EnergyPlus.  Our tool DesignBuilder uses EnergyPlus simulation engine, so you can try it out.

 

If you have further questions, you can contact us directly.

 

Regards,

Charlie Curcija

Can anyone offer advice on the most accurate route to model window performance?

There are discrepancies between modeling glazing from doe library and then modeling those values in simplified mode.

Is this steady state vs. transient heat transfer?  I am not familiar and I could use a lesson in thermo.

Is this discussed in the Engineer's Manual?  How about if I used Window5? Will I be able to import Window files into Doe2.2?

 

 

 

I would be grateful of any assistance.

Shivani,

Indeed the Induction Units (IU), and not Powered Induction Units (PIU), are
what you would use to model active chilled beams so that you could use the
zone coil to represent the chilled beam and associated chilled water flow.
(In my previous post on this topic I inadvertently mixed two conversations
into one---in the midst of related offline discussions of PIU features we'd
like to see in future versions of eQuest.) Anyway, it does appear that the
IUs are limited to using constant-volume primary airflow from the AHU as
Fred suggested, which would typically be 100% OA at some fixed ventilation
rate. If anyone knows a way to make this work otherwise, please chime in.

Using the IU, you would also still need to adjust the Induction Ratio to
correctly represent the relationship between supply water flow and
primary+induced airflow for the particular device and application. If the
zone loop temperatures are to differ substantially from the main loop, as is
often the case, there will also be challenges related to correctly
representing loop pumping power.

If you're modeling a passive chilled beam or radiant panel, you would need
to reduce the total fan static by 1 to 1.5 i.w.c. (per DOE-2 documentation)
below what it would be for induction units. However, if it is an active
chilled beam, depending on the specific unit, the fan static may be much
closer to what it would be for an induction unit, since many active beams
are essentially induction units with an expanded heat-exchange surface area
and radiant cooling effect as a result of limited exposure of chilled
surfaces.

If you want to model radiant panels in eQuest with cooling capacity
decoupled from ventilation air supply, the closest you can get is probably
modeling a Fan Coil with no fan energy. If ventilation air is to be supplied
by a central AHU, set the Outside Air from System to the appropriate system
in your model. Unfortunately, this is pretty fuzzy in terms of how a fan
coil vs. radiant system would interact with space loads, particularly in
spaces also served by an airside system. For example, this would be an
especially crude approximation if using either suspended radiant panels,
suspended passive chilled beams, or a chilled floor while allowing thermal
stratification in the space above, and then exhausting the hot air from the
top of the space: Even if you do the typical workarounds to approximate the
stratification (already very messy), you would still not be modeling
potentially significant radiant interaction between the warm ceiling and the
chilled floor, not to mention where the solar gain is going to end up.

If you simply need to get a approximation of energy consumption for these
systems within eQuest, the approaches above may get you reasonably close, at
least for many situations with simple overhead devices in well-mixed
environments---especially those with active chilled beams. However, as
alluded to above, there is no separate/explicit modeling of radiant exchange
in eQuest/DOE-2. Therefore, to the degree that the system you're modeling
does provide radiant cooling, these methods may be somewhat inaccurate,
particularly in situations with significant radiant asymmetry, and will
provide very limited information about thermal comfort and associated design
considerations. From a design perspective, you may want a tool such as Tas,
EnergyPlus, or Virtual Environment that models surface temperatures, related
thermal comfort parameters, and the radiant exchange between surfaces. These
tools also open up the possibility of more sophisticated analysis of energy
savings related to natural ventilation, which can have significant synergies
with radiant cooling.

Cheers again,
Timothy

Tim,
Thanks for your email. If we model active chilled beams as a PIU units, how
does one take account of the chilled water coil in a chilled beam unit? From
my understanding, PIU in eQUEST only has a re-heat coil and no chilled water
coils, which means that all the cooling is being done at the AHU which is
not actually the case. Can you throw us a light on that?

In the case of the PIUs (fan-powered boxes), it is true that both series and
parallel PIUs modeled in eQuest/DOE-2.2 presently assume a constant-volume
fan in the box. For series units the fan is always on per schedule and draws
from both the primary and secondary air streams. For the parallel unit the
fan draws only from the secondary air and runs as needed (on/off only) to
meet zone demands.  

If the terminal unit includes a fan with variable speed drive, the method is
presently the same as for any PIU with a variable speed drive: Run the
model; Then, based upon SIM file bin results for part-load operational
hours, determine the average part-load fraction; Finally, based on
performance curves for the terminal unit, or approximated using peak power
and fan laws, etc., determine an appropriate average kW/cfm for the PIU in
your application.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but the one drawback to the IU SYSTEM in DOE-2.x is
that the supply air volume is constant, or off. A system that varies primary
airflow in response to ventilation needs can't be modeled directly.

You can use induction units to simulate a chilled beam system but you might
also need to configure a seperate (or secondary) warmer chilled-water loop
and cooler hot-water loop for the zonal coils. You might also need to check
the induced ratio to scale the capacity of the primary air delivery and the
secondary induced air component.

Hope this helps.

and you want to see the difference in the whole-building model.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Simplied windows and glass libraries


Kevin,
 
The best way to accurately model windows is with WINDOW and THERM software
(windows.lbl.gov).  These tools are also used for NFRC (National
Fenestration Rating Council) certifications.  However, you will need all of
the details of frame and glazing design to be able to utilize these tools.
WINDOW program is used to model glazing system and THERM program is used to
model frame and edge of glass sections.  The whole product is then assembled
again in WINDOW program, so WINDOW has dual role.  While WINDOW program is
easy to learn and can be accomplished in half a day, THERM program requires
2-3 days of training for novice users.  Several companies offer training and
our company (www.designbuildersoftware.com) is one of them.  WINDOW program
creates DOE2 report file, which can be used with DOE 2.2 to assign windows.
That provides the most accurate way to model windows energy performance in a
building.
 
If you don't have all of the details and wish to get estimated performance,
you can use one of the predefined windows in DOE 2.2, closest to what you
have.  You should not use simplified way (i.e., by assigning simple
U-factor, SHGC and VT as single number), because that produces gross errors.
EnergyPlus program, which is newer generation energy simulation engine from
DOE does not even have an option to specify windows and doors that way.  You
have to have WINDOW EnergyPlus report file (equivalent to DOE2 report file)
or use one of predefined windows in EnergyPlus.  Our tool DesignBuilder uses
EnergyPlus simulation engine, so you can try it out.
 
If you have further questions, you can contact us directly.
 
Regards,
Charlie Curcija

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Simplied windows and glass libraries


Can anyone offer advice on the most accurate route to model window
performance?
There are discrepancies between modeling glazing from doe library and then
modeling those values in simplified mode.
Is this steady state vs. transient heat transfer?  I am not familiar and I
could use a lesson in thermo.
Is this discussed in the Engineer?s Manual?  How about if I used Window5?
Will I be able to import Window files into Doe2.2?
 
 
 
I would be grateful of any assistance.
 
Kevin

BUILDING ENERGY ANALYSIS  SEMINAR   
http://www.iit.edu/~archdoc/seminar.htm
 
Sponsor :    Ph.D. program, College of Architecture
                        http://www.iit.edu/~archdoc/index.html
http://www.iit.edu/colleges/arch/
 
Location :   Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT)
3410 South State Street, Chicago, IL 60616
http://www.iit.edu/
http://www.iit.edu/about/main_campus_map.html
 
Dates :          Monday May 21 thru Thursday May 24
Seminar ? 1:  eQUEST                    Monday-Tuesday May 21-22, 2007
Seminar ? 2:  VisualDOE               Wednesday-Thursday May 23-24, 2007
 
The classes will be held in the College of Architecture computer laboratory which has 30 workstations.  Electrical outlets are located at each work station for those who prefer to bring their own laptops.  Class size is limited to 25
.
Objective :
The objective of these two workshops is to introduce eQUEST and VisualDOE to architects and engineers.  These two programs are easy-to-use graphical CAD and Forms interfaces to the DOE2 energy program.  
 
Overview :
The use of building energy simulation programs is now necessary to show (1) energy code compliance using the performance method and (2) energy savings relative to code for LEED certification. Computer modeling and simulation of the project is required during the schematic phase to determine optimum the envelope, systems and plant based on economic payback. Detailed simulation is required when submitting the construction documents to show code compliance.  After construction and during operation, the results of the computer program building energy simulation analysis must be validated with Measurement & Verification (M&V) guidelines by the Federal Energy Management Program (USDOE).
 
Certificate & Continuing Education Units (CEUs) : 
Participants will be issued a certificate from the Dean of College of Architecture, IIT for each seminar, as a document to report the continuing education of your professions. College of Architecture, IIT, is a registered AIA/CES provider. According to AIA/CES guideline, Building Energy Analysis Seminar 2007 is considered the HSW (Health, Safety and Welfare) subject area. The seminar will provide 6 Continuing Education Units Learning Hours per day. 
 


eQUEST    
 
eQUEST? is a sophisticated, easy to use, building energy use analysis tool.  eQUEST was designed to allow you to perform detailed comparative analysis of building designs and technologies by applying sophisticated building energy use simulation techniques but without requiring extensive experience in the "art" of building performance modeling.  This is accomplished by combining schematic and design development building creation wizards, an energy efficiency measure (EEM) wizard and a graphical results display module with a complete up-to-date DOE.  You can read the eQUEST Overview to get a more complete summary of the features and capabilities of this program.  
 
eQUEST 3.55 was approved by the California Energy Commission as a 2001 Title 24 non-Residential ACM.  eQUEST is supported as a part of the Energy Design Resources (http://www.energydesignresources.com/) program which is funded by California utility customers and administered by Pacific Gas and Electric, San Diego Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison, Southern California Gas under the auspices of the California Public Utilities Commission as well as the Sacramento Municipal Utilities District.  eQUEST 3.6 is approved for use with Savings By Design (http://www.savingsbydesign.com/).  A free copy of eQUEST can be downloaded at: http://www.doe2.com/            .

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Custom Schedules in eQUEST
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200704271518.AA1831515pd80001412959@gard.com>

I am running an eQUEST model under a New York State program that requires a
very specific fractional lighting schedule set by the hour of the day. I
know the DOE-2 input should look like this:

LTG-1 = DAY-SCHEDULE
TYPE               = FRACTION
HOURS              = (1,24)
VALUES             = (  0.008,  0.008,  0.008,  0.008,  0.024,  0.050,
0.056,  0.050,
                      0.022,0.015...)

I know that schedules can be changed in the detailed data interface (cell by
cell, very tedious), but am wondering if there is a repeatable way to
implement the same lighting schedule on multiple projects.  Can I enter this
as a library item that could be easily called upon?

Would it be possible to define a lighting schedule (fractional) and then
call it up from within the wizard or the detailed data interface?

Any help would be most appreciated!

Thank you.

Ryan,
The standard building HVAC equipment selection is based on the type of
system you select for your proposed buildings. Rules for equipment
selection are explained in the Nonresidential ACM manual of the CA Title
24. These rules are intended to provide objective baseline energy
consumption for a given system type -- thus a DX system is compared to a
DX system, and a hydronic system is compared to a hydronic system. 
For details see "Table N2-10 - Standard Design System Selection
Flowchart" of the 2005 Nonresidential ACM Manual
(http://energy.ca.gov/title24/2005standards/nonresidential_acm/2005_NONR
ES_ACM_MANUAL.PDF)
Hope this helps,

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Moving Target (kBtu/sq.ft/yr) in the Performance
Calcs



Question regarding T-24 and the TDV Standard.

 

Why is the kBtu/sq.ft/yr for the Standard bldg a "moving target" for
performance calcs? 

 

Specifically, why does the Standard bldg energy consumption change as
the proposed HVAC system changes? 

 

We have always seen this as a serious flaw in the performance calcs (as
in using EnergyPro), and have yet to get a straight answer from anyone. 

 

Thanks again for the help.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Moving Target (kBtu/sq.ft/yr) in the Performance Calcs
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200704261239.AA3927718pd80001412322@gard.com>

Question regarding T-24 and the TDV Standard.

 

Why is the kBtu/sq.ft/yr for the Standard bldg a "moving target" for
performance calcs? 

 

Specifically, why does the Standard bldg energy consumption change as
the proposed HVAC system changes? 

 

We have always seen this as a serious flaw in the performance calcs (as
in using EnergyPro), and have yet to get a straight answer from anyone. 

 

Thanks again for the help.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200704261056.AA5616453pd80001412231@gard.com>

Dear Colleagues,
   I am looking for the thermal model of a barrel vault style 
greenhouse (metal half hoops with one or two sheets of thin plastic 
stretched over them, enclosed on both ends but usually heavily 
ventilated). I am not too concerned about the floor slab and ground 
coupling aspect as we have good models for that already in TRNSYS. I 
am more interested in the energy transfer through the skin of the 
greenhouse and ideally, a radiation balance on the interior. Is 
anybody aware of research that has been done in this area and whether 
models have been developed? I am looking more for models of the 
fundamental energy transfers and not as much for approximations that 
can be made using work-arounds in existing tools. Any help or 
direction that could be provided would be greatly appreciated.
Kind regards,
  David

Tim,
Thanks for your email. If we model active chilled beams as a PIU units,
how does one take account of the chilled water coil in a chilled beam
unit? From my understanding, PIU in eQUEST only has a re-heat coil and
no chilled water coils, which means that all the cooling is being done
at the AHU which is not actually the case. Can you throw us a light on
that?

Thanks.

In the case of the PIUs (fan-powered boxes), it is true that both series
and parallel PIUs modeled in eQuest/DOE-2.2 presently assume a
constant-volume fan in the box. For series units the fan is always on
per schedule and draws from both the primary and secondary air streams.
For the parallel unit the fan draws only from the secondary air and runs
as needed (on/off only) to meet zone demands. If you have a chilled beam
that is essentially an actively cooled diffuser with no fan in it, you
can simply set the fan kW/cfm to zero (or near zero if eQuest gives you
an error massage for an entry of zero). 

If an active chilled beam includes a fan with variable speed drive, the
method is presently the same as for any PIU with a variable speed drive:
Run the model; Then, based upon SIM file bin results for part-load
operational hours, determine the average part-load fraction; Finally,
based on performance curves for the terminal unit, or approximated using
peak power and fan laws, etc., determine an appropriate average kW/cfm
for the PIU in your application.

While I'm using a beta version of eQuest with a bunch of new stuff (and
with quite a bit of functionality disabled until everything is worked
out) I'm pretty sure the above PIU features hold true for the standard
version as well.

FYI: Pending developments for the UFAD-enabled version of eQuest (which
thus far includes zone plume factors, diffuser efficiency factors,
modeling of the UFAD supply plenum as a thermal zone, and some
improvements to airflow sizing --- presently in rough beta form) support
that it will, if all goes as we hope, have variable-speed fans for PIUs
and a few other helpful changes by the time it's ready for public
release. However, be patient as the number of changes to be made may
take a little while for our good friend Steve Gates to turn into code.
(Many thanks to Steve for his efforts thus
far!) 

Cheers again,
Timothy

Correct me if I'm wrong, but the one drawback to the IU SYSTEM in
DOE-2.x is
that the supply air volume is constant, or off. A system that varies
primary
airflow in response to ventilation needs can't be modeled directly.

You can use induction units to simulate a chilled beam system but you
might
also need to configure a seperate (or secondary) warmer chilled-water
loop
and cooler hot-water loop for the zonal coils. You might also need to
check
the induced ratio to scale the capacity of the primary air delivery and
the
secondary induced air component.

Hope this helps.

A point of clarification about WINDOW 5 and DOE2 files -- it is not possible
to use THERM files for export to the DOE2 file that WINDOW 5 makes. So the
method below, using the generic frame choices that come with WINDOW 5, is
probably the most straightforward way to create the window for DOE2.

Kevin,
 
There is a method using LBL Window program that get the U-Factor for the
actual frame into the DOE-2 report without requiring you to get the
frame/mullion details and then model this in Therm:
 
First, based on selection of the actual glass from the international glazing
database, do the center-of glass calculation for the glazing unit within
that part of Window5. Then use the U-Factor charts for the frame/mullion
system(s) you plan to use or are considering (provided by most supplies of
curtain wall systems, etc.) to determine what the glazing system U-factor
should be for the appropriate ratio of glazed area to total area including
frame. Then return to Window5 and match the system U-Factor from this chart
by copying and modifying properties for the closest available frame
type/material in the Window5 frame library, checking the Total Window
Results when combined with your glazing unit. When, given the same
glass-to-frame area ratio, this result matches the one from the system
U-Factor chart for the frame/mullion system, you can then create the DOE-2
report from Window5 that you will reference in eQuest. Thus you will have
the angular optical data for the correct SHGC at each angle of incidence and
also an appropriate system U-Factor without having to actually model the
frame. This is particularly valuable if you are weighing a range of frame
systems with various insulating properties that also force or enable
different glazing units (i.e., they have a different maximum glazing pocket)
and you want to see the difference in the whole-building model.
 
Cheers,
Timothy

Kevin,
 
The best way to accurately model windows is with WINDOW and THERM software
(windows.lbl.gov).  These tools are also used for NFRC (National
Fenestration Rating Council) certifications.  However, you will need all of
the details of frame and glazing design to be able to utilize these tools.
WINDOW program is used to model glazing system and THERM program is used to
model frame and edge of glass sections.  The whole product is then assembled
again in WINDOW program, so WINDOW has dual role.  While WINDOW program is
easy to learn and can be accomplished in half a day, THERM program requires
2-3 days of training for novice users.  Several companies offer training and
our company (www.designbuildersoftware.com) is one of them.  WINDOW program
creates DOE2 report file, which can be used with DOE 2.2 to assign windows.
That provides the most accurate way to model windows energy performance in a
building.
 
If you don't have all of the details and wish to get estimated performance,
you can use one of the predefined windows in DOE 2.2, closest to what you
have.  You should not use simplified way (i.e., by assigning simple
U-factor, SHGC and VT as single number), because that produces gross errors.
EnergyPlus program, which is newer generation energy simulation engine from
DOE does not even have an option to specify windows and doors that way.  You
have to have WINDOW EnergyPlus report file (equivalent to DOE2 report file)
or use one of predefined windows in EnergyPlus.  Our tool DesignBuilder uses
EnergyPlus simulation engine, so you can try it out.
 
If you have further questions, you can contact us directly.

Charlie Curcija

Can anyone offer advice on the most accurate route to model window

There are discrepancies between modeling glazing from doe library and then
modeling those values in simplified mode.
Is this steady state vs. transient heat transfer?  I am not familiar and I
could use a lesson in thermo.
Is this discussed in the Engineer's Manual?  How about if I used Window5?
Will I be able to import Window files into Doe2.2?

Kevin,
 
There is a method using LBL Window program that get the U-Factor for the
actual frame into the DOE-2 report without requiring you to get the
frame/mullion details and then model this in Therm:
 
First, based on selection of the actual glass from the international glazing
database, do the center-of glass calculation for the glazing unit within
that part of Window5. Then use the U-Factor charts for the frame/mullion
system(s) you plan to use or are considering (provided by most supplies of
curtain wall systems, etc.) to determine what the glazing system U-factor
should be for the appropriate ratio of glazed area to total area including
frame. Then return to Window5 and match the system U-Factor from this chart
by copying and modifying properties for the closest available frame
type/material in the Window5 frame library, checking the Total Window
Results when combined with your glazing unit. When, given the same
glass-to-frame area ratio, this result matches the one from the system
U-Factor chart for the frame/mullion system, you can then create the DOE-2
report from Window5 that you will reference in eQuest. Thus you will have
the angular optical data for the correct SHGC at each angle of incidence and
also an appropriate system U-Factor without having to actually model the
frame. This is particularly valuable if you are weighing a range of frame
systems with various insulating properties that also force or enable
different glazing units (i.e., they have a different maximum glazing pocket)
and you want to see the difference in the whole-building model.
 
Cheers,
Timothy

Kevin,
 
The best way to accurately model windows is with WINDOW and THERM software
(windows.lbl.gov).  These tools are also used for NFRC (National
Fenestration Rating Council) certifications.  However, you will need all of
the details of frame and glazing design to be able to utilize these tools.
WINDOW program is used to model glazing system and THERM program is used to
model frame and edge of glass sections.  The whole product is then assembled
again in WINDOW program, so WINDOW has dual role.  While WINDOW program is
easy to learn and can be accomplished in half a day, THERM program requires
2-3 days of training for novice users.  Several companies offer training and
our company (www.designbuildersoftware.com) is one of them.  WINDOW program
creates DOE2 report file, which can be used with DOE 2.2 to assign windows.
That provides the most accurate way to model windows energy performance in a
building.
 
If you don't have all of the details and wish to get estimated performance,
you can use one of the predefined windows in DOE 2.2, closest to what you
have.  You should not use simplified way (i.e., by assigning simple
U-factor, SHGC and VT as single number), because that produces gross errors.
EnergyPlus program, which is newer generation energy simulation engine from
DOE does not even have an option to specify windows and doors that way.  You
have to have WINDOW EnergyPlus report file (equivalent to DOE2 report file)
or use one of predefined windows in EnergyPlus.  Our tool DesignBuilder uses
EnergyPlus simulation engine, so you can try it out.
 
If you have further questions, you can contact us directly.

Charlie Curcija

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Simplied windows and glass libraries


Can anyone offer advice on the most accurate route to model window
performance?
There are discrepancies between modeling glazing from doe library and then
modeling those values in simplified mode.
Is this steady state vs. transient heat transfer?  I am not familiar and I
could use a lesson in thermo.
Is this discussed in the Engineer's Manual?  How about if I used Window5?
Will I be able to import Window files into Doe2.2?
 
 
 
I would be grateful of any assistance.

Ryan,

If the chilled beams are in fact active, these approaches may work well,
since they are essentially terminal cooling coils with no terminal fan. IF
you are interested in optimizing performance related to thermal comfort,
however, you'll need to seek other tools, since eQuest is obviously not
explicitly accounting for the radiant cooling effect that chilled beams
include to one degree or another. 

Also, if you are considering passive chilled beams (radiant panels with fins
or slots to increase convective cooling, but no direct coupling to
mechanically driven supply airflow), you'll need to be sure to account for
the appropriate cooling capacity given the anticipated beam-to-air delta-T
for the application and no mechanically driven airflow. 

FYI: There are plans afoot and some groundwork laid to create a radiant
cooling model within eQuest. Pending funding (presently the significant
unknown, but watch this space), the idea will be to include a simple radiant
cooling terminal unit that can be used with any of the airside systems (much
the way baseboard heaters can be added in version 3.6). While the details
are far from being hammered out, it is possible that this could include
means of adjusting for the degree of convective interaction with room air,
air passively drawn from the return plenum (as would be the case for the
"chilled sails" from Price when used in a T-bar grid with DOAS), or SA from
a central air handler.

Best of luck,

You can use induction units to simulate a chilled beam system but you might
also need to configure a seperate (or secondary) warmer chilled-water loop
and cooler hot-water loop for the zonal coils. You might also need to check
the induced ratio to scale the capacity of the primary air delivery and the
secondary induced air component.

Hope this helps.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but the one drawback to the IU SYSTEM in DOE-2.x is that the supply air volume is constant, or off. A system that varies primary airflow in response to ventilation needs can't be modeled directly.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Availability of ESP-r Version 11.3 for Linux/Mac/Cygwin/Native Windows
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200704251133.AA3332328pd80001410984@gard.com>

ESP-r version 11.3 binaries are now available

Following last weeks notice of a new public distribution of ESP-r,
the Energy Systems Research Unit in Glasgow have created
single click installers for Linux, Mac OSX, Cygwin emulation
on Windows machines as well as a Native windows version.

The new installers can be found on the download page
of http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk  along with instructions.

For best results, use a web browser other than Windows Explorer.
The installers are 40-70MB depending on the computing platform.

ESP-r is distributed under terms of the GNU GPL license so you can
use if for any purpose allowed under that license.  As per that license
the source code of ESP-r can also be downloaded (instructions
at the end of this email).

Release Notes
11.3 (April 2007)
=================

Generic Code Update
-------------------
- Numerous changes have been made to accommodate native Windows
   file naming conventions (spaces, back slashes).  This improves
   the functionality of ESP-r under native Windows.
- Numerous changes have been made to improve the functionality of
   the GTK version of the project manager and climate analyzer.

Simulator
---------
- Support has been added for the CEN 13791 solar distribution rules.
   With this ESP-r passes on all CEN 13791 test cases.
- Two mass flow components have been added: a regulated window vent
   and a roof mounted ventilation cowl.
- Numerous changes have been made to the implementation of the Alberta
   Air Infiltration model (AIM-2).
- Two idealized HVAC models (GSHP and DHW) and the BASESIMP ground heat
   transfer model can now use a new method to calculate ground  
temperatures.
   Three plant components of water storage tanks also make use of  
this new model.
- A bug in the treatment of type 5 casual gains was repaired.

Project Manager
---------------
- A 'cancel' button has been added in ~135 locations to improve
   program navigation.
- The menu structure for (most) zone control law editing
   has been revised to facilitate the description of controls.
   Documentation has also been improved and new exemplars have been
   created to demonstrate the use of about a dozen zone control laws.
- A facility has been added to allow the importation of typical
   operations, air flow, and casual gain profiles.
- Labels related to flow component 40 have been updated to remove
   the words 'volume flow' because it is actually an opening type.
- The QA report could be confused by old control files and this has
   been repaired.
- Support has been added for 'silently' inserting openings in surfaces.
- Support has been added for the reading of a zip geometry format file
   (as produced by the Xzip program).
- The functionality of the events profile database manager has been
   incorporated into the project manager to eliminate the need for this
   separate utility.
- Some alterations have been made to the structure of the database menus
   to improve program navigation.
- An option has been added to allow the export of version 1.2, 1.3, 1.4,
   and (some aspects of) 2.0 EnergyPlus IDF files.
- The format of the IPV report has been updated.  A control has been
   added to allow the user to toggle between IPV report formats.
- The user input dialogue for the 'constant' boundary condition has been
   altered to allow the user to input a high temperature boundary
   condition (e.g. 500C).

Results Analyzer
----------------
- An error in the reporting of surface absorbed solar radiation
   was corrected.

Quality Control Utility
-----------------------
- A number of new test cases have been added to the regression tester.
- New functionality has been added to the regression tester to
   facilitate diagnosing errors.

Climate Data
------------
- The documentation on solar radiation data has been improved in the
   ASCII data exported from the climate analyser.

Additional Changes
------------------
- Many additional changes have been made that are transparent to the
   user.

Further details can be found in ESP-r Central's change
log by providing the following URL to your web browser:
https://esp-r.net/wsvn/espr/wsvn/esp-r/.



Details about the binary distributions:

a) Linux installer for either the legacy X11 interface or the GTK  
based interface
      This has been tested on Mandriva and Fedora Core 4 and 5 as  
well as
      Ubuntu 6.10.  The installer places ESP-r in /opt/esru now  
rather than the
      traditional (non-standard) /usr/esru folder.

b) Mac OSX 10.4+ installer for PPC based computers for either the  
legacy X11 interface
     or the GTK based interface.  It runs natively on PPC machines  
and in emulation
     mode on Intel based machines.  The installer places ESP-r in / 
opt/esru.

c) Cygwin emulation environment on Windows 2K/XP for either the  
legacy X11
     interface or the GTK based interface.  The installer places ESP- 
r in /usr/esru.

d) Native windows uses a graphical installer and places the GTK based
     interface in C:/Esru

Each installer has a matching documentation file that provides  
additional
information.

Source code:

The source code may be accessed via the ESP-r Central Subversion
repository.  To do this, you must first install a Subversion client on
your system.  Free clients are available at
http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html.

Once you have installed the Subversion client you can download the
source code for version 11.3 of ESP-r anonymously using the following
command:
	svn checkout https://esp-r.net/espr/esp-r/trunk
	OR
	svn checkout http://esp-r.net/espr/esp-r/trunk
         OR (to omit the svn bookkeeping files)
	svn export https://esp-r.net/espr/esp-r/trunk

If you previously checked out version 11.1 or 11.2 with the above
command, then you do not have to do a full download of version 11.3.
Rather, you can update the source code by executing the following
command from your "trunk" directory:
	svn update

If you previously used svn export then you must repeat the export
command to get ESP-r.

We recommend this update to all current users of ESP-r.  If you have
not joined the community these installers can get you up and exploring!

Kevin,
 
The best way to accurately model windows is with WINDOW and THERM software
(windows.lbl.gov).  These tools are also used for NFRC (National
Fenestration Rating Council) certifications.  However, you will need all of
the details of frame and glazing design to be able to utilize these tools.
WINDOW program is used to model glazing system and THERM program is used to
model frame and edge of glass sections.  The whole product is then assembled
again in WINDOW program, so WINDOW has dual role.  While WINDOW program is
easy to learn and can be accomplished in half a day, THERM program requires
2-3 days of training for novice users.  Several companies offer training and
our company (www.designbuildersoftware.com) is one of them.  WINDOW program
creates DOE2 report file, which can be used with DOE 2.2 to assign windows.
That provides the most accurate way to model windows energy performance in a
building.
 
If you don't have all of the details and wish to get estimated performance,
you can use one of the predefined windows in DOE 2.2, closest to what you
have.  You should not use simplified way (i.e., by assigning simple
U-factor, SHGC and VT as single number), because that produces gross errors.
EnergyPlus program, which is newer generation energy simulation engine from
DOE does not even have an option to specify windows and doors that way.  You
have to have WINDOW EnergyPlus report file (equivalent to DOE2 report file)
or use one of predefined windows in EnergyPlus.  Our tool DesignBuilder uses
EnergyPlus simulation engine, so you can try it out.
 
If you have further questions, you can contact us directly.
 
Regards,
Charlie Curcija

Can anyone offer advice on the most accurate route to model window
performance?
There are discrepancies between modeling glazing from doe library and then
modeling those values in simplified mode.
Is this steady state vs. transient heat transfer?  I am not familiar and I
could use a lesson in thermo.
Is this discussed in the Engineer's Manual?  How about if I used Window5?
Will I be able to import Window files into Doe2.2?
 
 
 
I would be grateful of any assistance.

Kevin,

DOE-2's glass library contains output from LBL's window software. It takes
into account the incident angle dependency of solar heat  gain and visible
light transmittance, which is superior to using the simplified input method.

If you don't find the glazing you want in the DOE-2 glass library, you could
import results from Window software.

Is there a documented why to predict the run time 
hours for these type of exhaust/pressurization 
systems?  It seems to me they are quite intermittent with a low utilization.

The 90.1-2004 User's Manual states in Section 6.5.3,

"Fans that ventilate only, such as garage exhaust fans or equipment room
ventilation fans that transfer only unconditioned outdoor air, do not
qualify as a fan system in this context.  Fan systems must be part of a
system with heating or cooling capability."

The user's manual provides a few additional useful clarifications regarding
what constitutes a "fan system".

Garage exhaust fans, stairwell pressurization fans, etc. should be modeled
as miscellaneous load, with both the CFM and BHP per CFM modeled identically
(except the motor efficiency in the proposed case can be modeled as
improving upon the requirements of Section 10.4)

I've done some of the same garage exhaust fan pondering. 

 

The appendix G language is as follows:

"G3.1.2.9 Supply Fan Power. System fan electrical power

for supply, return, exhaust, and relief (excluding power to fanpowered

VAV boxes) shall be calculated using the following

formulas:.."

 

The word "exhaust" in this section has led me to believe it is appropriate
to use the G3.1.2.9 formula for the baseline garage exhaust fan kw/cfm
calculation.

I also agree the design cfm should be the same in both the proposed and
baseline garage exhaust system models.

I would certainly like to take the Option 2 approach mentioned for all the
projects I'm submitting, but I'm pretty sure it's not allowed:

Table 11.3.1.12 specifically lists garage ventilation fans (and exhaust
fans also) as a "Miscellaneous load".  Per the requirements of that
section, the loads "shall be assumed to be identical in the proposed and
budget building design" 

This seems to indicate that Option 1 is the only option that would comply
with the requirements of Appendix G.

Neeraj,

I would agree that your interpretation and your proposed 'option 2' appear
to be meeting the requirements of App G. The LEED NC V2.2 Reference Guide
(refer to EA Credit 1 Calculations for 'Other Systems,' page 182)
indicates that where specific energy efficiency requirements exist in
A90.1, the lowest allowable efficiency shall be used for the Baseline.
Garage ventilation is included in the sample listing of 'other' systems
and the fan power allowance should apply to that system. Not sure whether
LEED CS V2.0 has something equivalent.

 

That said, I am not a LEED reviewer. It would be interesting to hear what
others think on this as the fan power allowance is likely easy to beat for
a ventilation only system where system pressure drop is minimal. I would
expect that the intent of App G may not be to 'credit' these types of
systems.

Hi all,

*	LEED, Core and Shell V2.0
*	A 300,000 sqft building, 12 stories above ground located in
Washington DC. The baseline building is System # 8, i.e. VAV fan
controlled, PIU, all electric heating and cooling.
*	Problem Area -- To determine a correct Baseline: In the proposed
design, 3 levels of underground parking garage are merely ventilated with
constant volume fans and they are not equipped with CO/NOx sensors , i.e.
they are merely constant volume, SA and EA fans.
*	We know that garage ventilation is not process energy, so it must
be regulated somehow, right?! Plus, we cannot take credit for energy
savings from OA ventilation air (according to Appendix G). Now, since this
is a 'fans only' situation in both the models (no cooling or heating) I
have assumed the CFM of OA ventilation air must be the same in both cases.
Am I correct, so far? 
*	Using this as a premise, the following two contradicting scenarios
for an appropriate baseline model can reasonably  be thought of:

1.	Model similar SA and EA CFM as in the "Proposed Building Model"
with similar fan power kW/CFM, OR
2.	Model similar SA and EA CFM as in the "Proposed Building Model"
but calculating the fan power for the OA flow using Section G3.1.2.9 of
the Informative Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1-2004.

THE BIG QUESTION(s): Is the second option a valid approach for determining
fan power (kW/CFM) for the baseline? 

OR

Is the method only meant for determining (and thus crediting/penalising)
system supply air fans and not parking garage fans? 

Thanks,
Neeraj

Problem Area -- To determine a correct Baseline: In the proposed design, 3 levels of underground parking garage are merely ventilated with constant volume fans and they are not equipped with CO/NOx sensors , i.e. they are merely constant volume, SA and EA fans.
We know that garage ventilation is not process energy, so it must be regulated somehow, right?! Plus, we cannot take credit for energy savings from OA ventilation air (according to Appendix G). Now, since this is a 'fans only' situation in both the models (no cooling or heating) I have assumed the CFM of OA ventilation air must be the same in both cases. Am I correct, so far?
Using this as a premise, the following two contradicting scenarios for an appropriate baseline model can reasonably  be thought of:
Model similar SA and EA CFM as in the "Proposed Building Model" with similar fan power kW/CFM, OR
Model similar SA and EA CFM as in the "Proposed Building Model" but calculating the fan power for the OA flow using Section G3.1.2.9 of the Informative Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1-2004.
THE BIG QUESTION(s): Is the second option a valid approach for determining fan power (kW/CFM) for the baseline? 
OR
Is the method only meant for determining (and thus crediting/penalising) system supply air fans and not parking garage fans?

Thanks,

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Radiant Floor Heating System
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200704201201.AA0133578pd80001409006@gard.com>

Hello All,

It was suggested that convective floor heating system using zone placed
baseboards could be used to model Radiant floor heating if the floor/room
temp delta is low so the main mode is convection (typical) and the piping is
placed near the surface (also typical).

1. Is temp delta of 10 deg F acceptable? I learn that typically the floor
temperature is 85 deg F for radiant floor heating system. 

2. I understand that doe-2 does not allow a primary to secondary loop heat
exchanger - it assumes the loop-to-loop heat transfer

is via a valve and fluid flow ... where in the real radiant floor system
(typically) the boiler water is hot flow low with a heat exchanger with the
separate floor loop with higher flow and lower T (typically just a few
degrees above the desired room T rather than 150-180 degF). So in this case
a higher flow loop in doe-2 with the total pump head/flow set to get the
total pump power is tricky. What is the typical number on this? I have a
1273 sqft detach house and 3670 sqft 8 units apt.

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Sharon - you can't do this without some serious "faking" within eQuest -
only one system per zone. However, if you treat your radiant floor as
baseboard heaters (basically just BTU injectors) then you can combine
your "radiant floor" with cooling ventilation units, such as a VAV
system. always worth double checking that it is working correctly
though.

Hi,
 
I am modeling a university building which gets its chilled water from the campus central plant at very high cost. As per Appendix G, the Baseline Building is modeled with a packaged DX unit and the electricity cost for this is substantially lower than the cost of chilled water - making the comparison way off-balance. If anybody has come across a better way of dealing with the energy cost comparison in such a situation, I will appreciate the feedback.
 
Thanks!

An additional question with a system like this:  What system type would be attached to this?  The only fan coil system type is a 4 pipe fan coil and since there is no real "HW Loop" setup, I could never get this to work.  Would you choose the Water Loop HP system type with the Heat Source set to Heat Pump and set the EIRs to 1.0?

Thank you,

Hi Folks,


I am attempting to simulate a centralized GSHP using Equest. The plant side
is supposed to be coupled with vertical wells using ground loop HX. The
cooling plant equipment is supposed to be large heat pumps or centrifugal
chillers that reverse operation of evaporator and condenser when switching
from cooling to heating.The airside is fan coil rather than room-level
distributed heat pumps.



#1: According to doe-2.2 dictionary only lake/well loop is allowed to be
attached to large water -cooled HPs and chiller condensers. And WLHP is not
allowed so. Is there any method to model such a GSHP system in Equest?



#2: or can lake/well be used to mimic ground source loops? Any experience or
advice of using this alternative is highly appreciated.



Tons of thanks

I have done a similar system once before but only at the schematic
design level. I ended up having to use the lake/well option and estimate
the source temp. I ended up using monthly source temps that I scheduled
based on estimates from a borefield designer/contractor who did some
separate modeling of the borefield. It took some iterations as I had to
run the model on typicall; chiller/boiler systems first to get loads
that he could then put into his borefield model. In the end it was
probably accurate enough for the purposes of SD- level system
comparisons.
 
These models in equest baffle me as to why they have such restrictions
built-into them - perhaps the software developers can shed light on
their reasons for these restrictions, but it certainly is frustrating,
as you have found out...

Hi, all
 
When I define Geothermal heat pump with "Vertical Well Sweeden-G"

             If the pump was sized by default, most likely this

Maybe Brandon the question should be have you optimized the building to its site? (constraints and all).  
 
Are you using any daylight harvesting for example?  Have you tried to limit the western glazing to reduce some peak cooling loads?  Have you tried to introduce earth berms or some other super insulated material on the north side?
 
Not to beat you up over this, sorry in advance, these may be things out of your control, bad architect (I can say that).

Thanks Bill and Mike for your replies,
 
When while-intentioned theory is designated as policy without practical testing, the resulting requirements stand a much higher chance of ambiguous interpretation and misapplication by those tasked with the implementation.
 
Is the purpose of LEED to "reward" and "penalize" ... or to build better buildings?  The rating system is a tool, and when the tool becomes misshapen to accomplish some spurious objective (e.g. "reward" and "penalize") such that its effectiveness has been reduced for accomplishing its primary objective (i.e. "build better buildings"), then it's time to incorporate implementation feedback to improve the tool in such a way as to restore its previous effectiveness.
 
But my perception is that there is an open feedback loop at USGBC, caused by deferring to ASHRAE Appendix G and then choosing to ignore all amendments.  What is anyone's incentive to expend the effort required to develop an Appendix G amendment in hopes of improving the LEED process, knowing that it will be ignored by USGBC?  We all have an obligation to our employers and clients to spend our time wisely.
 
As for perceived meaninglessness of the orientation averaging requirement, I made the effort to quantify my intuition by rotating the baseline building we're working on (community college science & technology building), and the results are as follows:
 
 
  0? azimuth: $140,594 annual utility costs
 
 90? azimuth: $140,954
 
180? azimuth: $140,976
 
270? azimuth: $140,851
 
    Average:  $140,844, a difference of 0.078% from the 0? azimuth
 
 
Perhaps for some buildings the rotation exercise will make a difference, but not for this one.  Further, the building simply can't be rotated -- it is site constrained.
 
Note the average needed to be calculated outside of the simulation software, and by strict Appendix G interpretation, this "golden number" needs to be the one against which all EEMs are compared (again, outside of the simulation software), never mind that it's well within the error bounds of the unrotated building simulation.
 
So this orientation averaging requirement, while it may theoretically sound like a great idea, has the potential to generate pointless busy work for analysts while obfuscating the meaningfulness of a realistic baseline.  And the Appendix G fenestration amendment, which could help, is simply ignored by LEED 2.2 fiat.
 
Improving the language of Appendix G sounds like a worthy midterm goal, however the LEED 2.2 and Appendix G language in their current forms present real implementation problems today.  So in terms of LEED applications that are currently in process, is there a method to petition for exceptions against specific requirements which can be demonstrated to be of marginal value to a specific project?  
 
 
Anyone from USGBC out there?
 
 
Thanks

Brandon,
 
I think the thing you need to remember is that the integrity of any rating system is its ability to be fair and equitable to everyone.  This means that some buildings will get credit for design choices and others will get penalized.  We cannot have a system where you only get to count the benefits and not the penalties.  
 
There are a lot of things about the Appendix G methodology that are burdensome but they maintain the integrity of the rating system.  
 
The nice thing about ASHRAE is any member can participate in the process of improving work like Appendix G.  You should propose an alternate method that would allow a building to be exempt from the "significant and relatively meaningless calculation burden" you describe.

	Thanks Bill & Bing for your replies,
	 
	 
	Previously I started this topic going again with a point-by-point description of some implementation problems caused by the 'orientation averaging' and 'fenestration leveling' requirements of LEED 2.2 / 90.1-2004 Appendix G; please refer to that post for further details.  
	 
	 
	Here let me try to be as clear and concise as possible:
	 
	* There are, perhaps, only 10% of all buildings that can take advantage of alternate orientations.  Most are site-constrained, or have already been built.  
	 
	* There are perhaps a greater fraction than 10% of all buildings that can take advantage of alternate glass distributions, however glass distribution is also often constrained by site considerations.
	 
	* So to accommodate a minority of cases, LEED 2.2 / 90.1-2004 Appendix G seems to impose a significant and relatively meaningless calculation burden on the majority, by requiring the development of a fictitious baseline that needs to be manually maintained outside of the simulation software.
	 
	* How can we waive these requirements in LEED 2.2 for projects that cannot realistically benefit from them, and substitute a "code minimum" baseline oriented identically and glazed similarly to the proposed building? 
	 
	 
	On the last point, even if a site-constrained project could 'theoretically' benefit from orientation averaging or fenestration leveling, in principle I believe LEED teams should have the option to forgo that marginal benefit the sake of the simplicity, clarity, accuracy, and meaningfulness of the comparative calculations.
	 
	 
	 
	Thanks for your time, and hard work on LEED...

	One of the perceived shortcomings of Ch. 11 as a method for computing energy savings for green building rating purposes was that it did not provide sufficient opportunity to take credit for energy savings through envelope design and building orientation on the site.  The cited portion of Ch. 11 (Table 11.3, item 5) requires all envelope components of the Budget Building to be the same as the Proposed Building, eliminating that opportunity.
	
	The parallel part of Appendix G relaxes this constraint in a way that should make it possible for the Proposed Building to show a greater reduction in energy cost.  This is done by removing self-shading, distributing fenestration uniformly instead of optimally, and by averaging the effects of orientation.  If someone has done a robust test of orientation averaging vs. best and worst case orientations that shows negligible scatter around the mean, I am sure the ECB Subcommittee would be interested to see it.  
	
	The distribution of glazing was made uniform mainly because of the intent to average multiple orientations.

		As clarification, LEED v2.2 requires the use of the Performance Rating Method from Appendix G, not the ECB method (which was used in previous versions of LEED).  In fact, in the Reference Guide section of LEED v2.2 titled "Common mistakes made using the Performance Rating Method", the first mistake listed is "The Energy Cost Budget Method (Section 11) is incorrectly used rather than the Performance Rating Method (Appendix G) to obtain EA Credit 1 credit". 
		 
		Brandon - when I first read Appendix G, I was puzzled by their motivation.  Why rotate the building if you are already evenly distributing glass?  I am still not sure what the justification from ASHRAE is on that one.  I have not seen anything from USGBC that gives any exceptions to the rotating requirement.

		The Appendix G is an informative appendix and is not part of Standard 90.1. It is merely informative and does not contain requirements necessary for conformance to the Standard.
		 
		In the  Energy Cost Budget Method section in Table 11.3 under Section 5 Building Envelope, it describes the requirements for the Proposed Building design and the Budget Building design.  The first paragraph under the Budget Building design states.... The budget building shall have identical conditioned floor area and identical exterior dimensions and orientations as the proposed design, except as noted in (a), (b), and (c) in this clause. 
		 
		There's nothing in the Standard stating you must rotate the building in 90 degree increments and average the results. We've never been asked to do it to my knowledge by the USGBC during a LEED review of our projects.

		All,
		 
		This is an old thread, but one I thought worth revisiting to see if there have been any developments.  Specifically we are preparing a LEED Silver project for submittal, and while we understand he intent of the Appendix G 'multiple-orientation' and 'fenestration-leveling' requirements, our evaluation is that they impose extensive calculation requirements for arguably marginal returns on accuracy.
		 
		In the case of our specific building (as I would suspect the case of 90%+ of all buildings) there's simply no latitude to change the orientation.  Similarly with glass distribution, the lobby and entryway have the flexibility to be on one side and one side only of the building, and thus distributing the glass equally amongst all facets for the baseline model seems to add an unnecessary level of abstraction to the comparative analyses.
		 
		Does imposing the requirement for analysts to spend considerable effort developing fictitious baselines based on building orientations and glass distributions that have 0% chance of construction seem to be a reasonable requisite for LEED project certifications?  What I mean by 'considerable effort' is:
		 
		* That the all baseline numbers for each of the four orientations would need to be extracted from the analysis software, averaged on a spreadsheet, and a similar extraction done for all subsequent energy efficiency measure (EEM) comparisons.  Posting these numbers from analysis software to spreadsheets would be both time-consuming and introduce another level of potential error, and thus require additional error-checking.  
		 
		* That a new building would need to be developed, with glass redistributed equally amongst all facets, for the four-point orientation exercise described above.  Again, while this may sound reasonable from a theoretical standpoint, practically speaking this requirement serves to decouple the baseline from glazing-dependent energy efficiency measures.  How meaningful is changing the U-value or shading coefficient of the glass in an EEM in comparison to a fictitious baseline, when the glass distribution is crucial to determining whether or not the measure is cost-effective?  As with building orientations, posting these numbers from analysis software to spreadsheets would be both time-consuming and additionally error-prone. 
		 
		All to fulfill the requirement of deriving a fictitious baseline for use in the comparative analyses -- no doubt these requirements were incorporated with good intention, but practical implementation considerations seem to have not been considered carefully enough.
		 
		Further, we find the concept of comparing proposed energy efficiency measures to a "code minimum" baseline building, oriented identically and glazed similarly to each of the EEMs, to be intuitively more meaningful to both the owner and project team (and thus presumably to the LEED reviewer) than comparison to a fictitious baseline.  This approach allows the baseline to reside in the analysis software, and EEM comparisons accomplished using the built-in 'parametric run' features of the analysis software (eQuest and others) to reduce the time-consuming error-prone tediousness of extracting and posting numbers to a spreadsheet for comparative evaluation.
		 
		Has anyone had success in obtaining LEED project approval when excepting these 'building orientation averaging' and 'glazing-area leveling' requirements?  What is required in terms of the LEED application to waive these requirements?
		 
		Also, does anyone know if these requirements have been identified for relaxation or revision in the next LEED update?

Thanks Bill and Mike for your replies,
 
When while-intentioned theory is designated as policy without practical testing, the resulting requirements stand a much higher chance of ambiguous interpretation and misapplication by those tasked with the implementation.
 
Is the purpose of LEED to "reward" and "penalize" ... or to build better buildings?  The rating system is a tool, and when the tool becomes misshapen to accomplish some spurious objective (e.g. "reward" and "penalize") such that its effectiveness has been reduced for accomplishing its primary objective (i.e. "build better buildings"), then it's time to incorporate implementation feedback to improve the tool in such a way as to restore its previous effectiveness.
 
But my perception is that there is an open feedback loop at USGBC, caused by deferring to ASHRAE Appendix G and then choosing to ignore all amendments.  What is anyone's incentive to expend the effort required to develop an Appendix G amendment in hopes of improving the LEED process, knowing that it will be ignored by USGBC?  We all have an obligation to our employers and clients to spend our time wisely.
 
As for perceived meaninglessness of the orientation averaging requirement, I made the effort to quantify my intuition by rotating the baseline building we're working on (community college science & technology building), and the results are as follows:
 
 
  0? azimuth: $140,594 annual utility costs
 
 90? azimuth: $140,954
 
180? azimuth: $140,976
 
270? azimuth: $140,851
 
    Average:  $140,844, a difference of 0.078% from the 0? azimuth
 
 
Perhaps for some buildings the rotation exercise will make a difference, but not for this one.  Further, the building simply can't be rotated -- it is site constrained.
 
Note the average needed to be calculated outside of the simulation software, and by strict Appendix G interpretation, this "golden number" needs to be the one against which all EEMs are compared (again, outside of the simulation software), never mind that it's well within the error bounds of the unrotated building simulation.
 
So this orientation averaging requirement, while it may theoretically sound like a great idea, has the potential to generate pointless busy work for analysts while obfuscating the meaningfulness of a realistic baseline.  And the Appendix G fenestration amendment, which could help, is simply ignored by LEED 2.2 fiat.
 
Improving the language of Appendix G sounds like a worthy midterm goal, however the LEED 2.2 and Appendix G language in their current forms present real implementation problems today.  So in terms of LEED applications that are currently in process, is there a method to petition for exceptions against specific requirements which can be demonstrated to be of marginal value to a specific project?  
 
 
Anyone from USGBC out there?
 
 
Thanks

Brandon,
 
I think the thing you need to remember is that the integrity of any rating system is its ability to be fair and equitable to everyone.  This means that some buildings will get credit for design choices and others will get penalized.  We cannot have a system where you only get to count the benefits and not the penalties.  
 
There are a lot of things about the Appendix G methodology that are burdensome but they maintain the integrity of the rating system.  
 
The nice thing about ASHRAE is any member can participate in the process of improving work like Appendix G.  You should propose an alternate method that would allow a building to be exempt from the "significant and relatively meaningless calculation burden" you describe.

	Thanks Bill & Bing for your replies,
	 
	 
	Previously I started this topic going again with a point-by-point description of some implementation problems caused by the 'orientation averaging' and 'fenestration leveling' requirements of LEED 2.2 / 90.1-2004 Appendix G; please refer to that post for further details.  
	 
	 
	Here let me try to be as clear and concise as possible:
	 
	* There are, perhaps, only 10% of all buildings that can take advantage of alternate orientations.  Most are site-constrained, or have already been built.  
	 
	* There are perhaps a greater fraction than 10% of all buildings that can take advantage of alternate glass distributions, however glass distribution is also often constrained by site considerations.
	 
	* So to accommodate a minority of cases, LEED 2.2 / 90.1-2004 Appendix G seems to impose a significant and relatively meaningless calculation burden on the majority, by requiring the development of a fictitious baseline that needs to be manually maintained outside of the simulation software.
	 
	* How can we waive these requirements in LEED 2.2 for projects that cannot realistically benefit from them, and substitute a "code minimum" baseline oriented identically and glazed similarly to the proposed building? 
	 
	 
	On the last point, even if a site-constrained project could 'theoretically' benefit from orientation averaging or fenestration leveling, in principle I believe LEED teams should have the option to forgo that marginal benefit the sake of the simplicity, clarity, accuracy, and meaningfulness of the comparative calculations.
	 
	 
	 
	Thanks for your time, and hard work on LEED...

	One of the perceived shortcomings of Ch. 11 as a method for computing energy savings for green building rating purposes was that it did not provide sufficient opportunity to take credit for energy savings through envelope design and building orientation on the site.  The cited portion of Ch. 11 (Table 11.3, item 5) requires all envelope components of the Budget Building to be the same as the Proposed Building, eliminating that opportunity.
	
	The parallel part of Appendix G relaxes this constraint in a way that should make it possible for the Proposed Building to show a greater reduction in energy cost.  This is done by removing self-shading, distributing fenestration uniformly instead of optimally, and by averaging the effects of orientation.  If someone has done a robust test of orientation averaging vs. best and worst case orientations that shows negligible scatter around the mean, I am sure the ECB Subcommittee would be interested to see it.  
	
	The distribution of glazing was made uniform mainly because of the intent to average multiple orientations.

		As clarification, LEED v2.2 requires the use of the Performance Rating Method from Appendix G, not the ECB method (which was used in previous versions of LEED).  In fact, in the Reference Guide section of LEED v2.2 titled "Common mistakes made using the Performance Rating Method", the first mistake listed is "The Energy Cost Budget Method (Section 11) is incorrectly used rather than the Performance Rating Method (Appendix G) to obtain EA Credit 1 credit". 
		 
		Brandon - when I first read Appendix G, I was puzzled by their motivation.  Why rotate the building if you are already evenly distributing glass?  I am still not sure what the justification from ASHRAE is on that one.  I have not seen anything from USGBC that gives any exceptions to the rotating requirement.

		The Appendix G is an informative appendix and is not part of Standard 90.1. It is merely informative and does not contain requirements necessary for conformance to the Standard.
		 
		In the  Energy Cost Budget Method section in Table 11.3 under Section 5 Building Envelope, it describes the requirements for the Proposed Building design and the Budget Building design.  The first paragraph under the Budget Building design states.... The budget building shall have identical conditioned floor area and identical exterior dimensions and orientations as the proposed design, except as noted in (a), (b), and (c) in this clause. 
		 
		There's nothing in the Standard stating you must rotate the building in 90 degree increments and average the results. We've never been asked to do it to my knowledge by the USGBC during a LEED review of our projects.

		All,
		 
		This is an old thread, but one I thought worth revisiting to see if there have been any developments.  Specifically we are preparing a LEED Silver project for submittal, and while we understand he intent of the Appendix G 'multiple-orientation' and 'fenestration-leveling' requirements, our evaluation is that they impose extensive calculation requirements for arguably marginal returns on accuracy.
		 
		In the case of our specific building (as I would suspect the case of 90%+ of all buildings) there's simply no latitude to change the orientation.  Similarly with glass distribution, the lobby and entryway have the flexibility to be on one side and one side only of the building, and thus distributing the glass equally amongst all facets for the baseline model seems to add an unnecessary level of abstraction to the comparative analyses.
		 
		Does imposing the requirement for analysts to spend considerable effort developing fictitious baselines based on building orientations and glass distributions that have 0% chance of construction seem to be a reasonable requisite for LEED project certifications?  What I mean by 'considerable effort' is:
		 
		* That the all baseline numbers for each of the four orientations would need to be extracted from the analysis software, averaged on a spreadsheet, and a similar extraction done for all subsequent energy efficiency measure (EEM) comparisons.  Posting these numbers from analysis software to spreadsheets would be both time-consuming and introduce another level of potential error, and thus require additional error-checking.  
		 
		* That a new building would need to be developed, with glass redistributed equally amongst all facets, for the four-point orientation exercise described above.  Again, while this may sound reasonable from a theoretical standpoint, practically speaking this requirement serves to decouple the baseline from glazing-dependent energy efficiency measures.  How meaningful is changing the U-value or shading coefficient of the glass in an EEM in comparison to a fictitious baseline, when the glass distribution is crucial to determining whether or not the measure is cost-effective?  As with building orientations, posting these numbers from analysis software to spreadsheets would be both time-consuming and additionally error-prone. 
		 
		All to fulfill the requirement of deriving a fictitious baseline for use in the comparative analyses -- no doubt these requirements were incorporated with good intention, but practical implementation considerations seem to have not been considered carefully enough.
		 
		Further, we find the concept of comparing proposed energy efficiency measures to a "code minimum" baseline building, oriented identically and glazed similarly to each of the EEMs, to be intuitively more meaningful to both the owner and project team (and thus presumably to the LEED reviewer) than comparison to a fictitious baseline.  This approach allows the baseline to reside in the analysis software, and EEM comparisons accomplished using the built-in 'parametric run' features of the analysis software (eQuest and others) to reduce the time-consuming error-prone tediousness of extracting and posting numbers to a spreadsheet for comparative evaluation.
		 
		Has anyone had success in obtaining LEED project approval when excepting these 'building orientation averaging' and 'glazing-area leveling' requirements?  What is required in terms of the LEED application to waive these requirements?
		 
		Also, does anyone know if these requirements have been identified for relaxation or revision in the next LEED update?

Brandon,
 
I think the thing you need to remember is that the integrity of any
rating system is its ability to be fair and equitable to everyone.  This
means that some buildings will get credit for design choices and others
will get penalized.  We cannot have a system where you only get to count
the benefits and not the penalties.  
 
There are a lot of things about the Appendix G methodology that are
burdensome but they maintain the integrity of the rating system.  
 
The nice thing about ASHRAE is any member can participate in the process
of improving work like Appendix G.  You should propose an alternate
method that would allow a building to be exempt from the "significant
and relatively meaningless calculation burden" you describe.

	Thanks Bill & Bing for your replies,
	 
	 
	Previously I started this topic going again with a
point-by-point description of some implementation problems caused by the
'orientation averaging' and 'fenestration leveling' requirements of LEED
2.2 / 90.1-2004 Appendix G; please refer to that post for further
details.  
	 
	 
	Here let me try to be as clear and concise as possible:
	 
	* There are, perhaps, only 10% of all buildings that can take
advantage of alternate orientations.  Most are site-constrained, or have
already been built.  
	 
	* There are perhaps a greater fraction than 10% of all buildings
that can take advantage of alternate glass distributions, however glass
distribution is also often constrained by site considerations.
	 
	* So to accommodate a minority of cases, LEED 2.2 / 90.1-2004
Appendix G seems to impose a significant and relatively meaningless
calculation burden on the majority, by requiring the development of a
fictitious baseline that needs to be manually maintained outside of the
simulation software.
	 
	* How can we waive these requirements in LEED 2.2 for projects
that cannot realistically benefit from them, and substitute a "code
minimum" baseline oriented identically and glazed similarly to the
proposed building? 
	 
	 
	On the last point, even if a site-constrained project could
'theoretically' benefit from orientation averaging or fenestration
leveling, in principle I believe LEED teams should have the option to
forgo that marginal benefit the sake of the simplicity, clarity,
accuracy, and meaningfulness of the comparative calculations.
	 
	 
	 
	Thanks for your time, and hard work on LEED...

	One of the perceived shortcomings of Ch. 11 as a method for
computing energy savings for green building rating purposes was that it
did not provide sufficient opportunity to take credit for energy savings
through envelope design and building orientation on the site.  The cited
portion of Ch. 11 (Table 11.3, item 5) requires all envelope components
of the Budget Building to be the same as the Proposed Building,
eliminating that opportunity.
	
	The parallel part of Appendix G relaxes this constraint in a way
that should make it possible for the Proposed Building to show a greater
reduction in energy cost.  This is done by removing self-shading,
distributing fenestration uniformly instead of optimally, and by
averaging the effects of orientation.  If someone has done a robust test
of orientation averaging vs. best and worst case orientations that shows
negligible scatter around the mean, I am sure the ECB Subcommittee would
be interested to see it.  
	
	The distribution of glazing was made uniform mainly because of
the intent to average multiple orientations.

		As clarification, LEED v2.2 requires the use of the

used in previous versions of LEED).  In fact, in the Reference Guide
section of LEED v2.2 titled "Common mistakes made using the Performance
Rating Method", the first mistake listed is "The Energy Cost Budget

ASHRAE is on that one.  I have not seen anything from USGBC that gives
any exceptions to the rotating requirement.

		The Appendix G is an informative appendix and is not
part of Standard 90.1. It is merely informative and does not contain
requirements necessary for conformance to the Standard.
		 
		In the  Energy Cost Budget Method section in Table 11.3
under Section 5 Building Envelope, it describes the requirements for the
Proposed Building design and the Budget Building design.  The first
paragraph under the Budget Building design states.... The budget
building shall have identical conditioned floor area and identical
exterior dimensions and orientations as the proposed design, except as
noted in (a), (b), and (c) in this clause. 
		 
		There's nothing in the Standard stating you must rotate
the building in 90 degree increments and average the results. We've
never been asked to do it to my knowledge by the USGBC during a LEED
review of our projects.

		All,
		 
		This is an old thread, but one I thought worth
revisiting to see if there have been any developments.  Specifically we
are preparing a LEED Silver project for submittal, and while we
understand he intent of the Appendix G 'multiple-orientation' and
'fenestration-leveling' requirements, our evaluation is that they impose
extensive calculation requirements for arguably marginal returns on
accuracy.
		 
		In the case of our specific building (as I would suspect
the case of 90%+ of all buildings) there's simply no latitude to change
the orientation.  Similarly with glass distribution, the lobby and
entryway have the flexibility to be on one side and one side only of the
building, and thus distributing the glass equally amongst all facets for
the baseline model seems to add an unnecessary level of abstraction to
the comparative analyses.
		 
		Does imposing the requirement for analysts to spend
considerable effort developing fictitious baselines based on building
orientations and glass distributions that have 0% chance of construction
seem to be a reasonable requisite for LEED project certifications?  What
I mean by 'considerable effort' is:
		 
		* That the all baseline numbers for each of the four
orientations would need to be extracted from the analysis software,
averaged on a spreadsheet, and a similar extraction done for all
subsequent energy efficiency measure (EEM) comparisons.  Posting these
numbers from analysis software to spreadsheets would be both
time-consuming and introduce another level of potential error, and thus
require additional error-checking.  
		 
		* That a new building would need to be developed, with
glass redistributed equally amongst all facets, for the four-point
orientation exercise described above.  Again, while this may sound
reasonable from a theoretical standpoint, practically speaking this
requirement serves to decouple the baseline from glazing-dependent
energy efficiency measures.  How meaningful is changing the U-value or
shading coefficient of the glass in an EEM in comparison to a fictitious
baseline, when the glass distribution is crucial to determining whether
or not the measure is cost-effective?  As with building orientations,
posting these numbers from analysis software to spreadsheets would be
both time-consuming and additionally error-prone. 
		 
		All to fulfill the requirement of deriving a fictitious
baseline for use in the comparative analyses -- no doubt these
requirements were incorporated with good intention, but practical
implementation considerations seem to have not been considered carefully
enough.
		 
		Further, we find the concept of comparing proposed
energy efficiency measures to a "code minimum" baseline building,
oriented identically and glazed similarly to each of the EEMs, to be
intuitively more meaningful to both the owner and project team (and thus
presumably to the LEED reviewer) than comparison to a fictitious
baseline.  This approach allows the baseline to reside in the analysis
software, and EEM comparisons accomplished using the built-in
'parametric run' features of the analysis software (eQuest and others)
to reduce the time-consuming error-prone tediousness of extracting and
posting numbers to a spreadsheet for comparative evaluation.
		 
		Has anyone had success in obtaining LEED project
approval when excepting these 'building orientation averaging' and
'glazing-area leveling' requirements?  What is required in terms of the
LEED application to waive these requirements?
		 
		Also, does anyone know if these requirements have been
identified for relaxation or revision in the next LEED update?

My experience has been that there are a reasonable number of buildings
that could benefit from optimizing orientation/geometry/fenestration
area, and ASHRAE/LEED's efforts to credit projects for doing this when
possible seems fair. I do agree however, that the rotation effort
doesn't always make sense as some projects can't realistically do
anything about orientation. 
 
I haven't seen a need to complete additional calculations on the
baseline outside the software as the orientation/fenestration changes
can be done within the software most of the time. Simply rotating the
building isn't the best comparison as it does affect system sizes and
zone loads, but since App. G/LEED doesn't require reporting unmet load
hours for the incremental rotations, it doesn't appear that the intent
was to require detailed system and zone level adjustments for these
runs.
 
The question is whether creating an 'optional' path makes it easier for
projects to ignore orientation and not be penalized for an orientation
that results in higher energy consumption/costs. I would vote for
keeping it in and requiring the project team to document why orientation
is not a valid ECM for a specific project. This would require more
'interpretation' by the LEED reviewers, but makes the process more
flexible.

Here let me try to be as clear and concise as possible:
 
? There are, perhaps, only 10% of all buildings that can take advantage
of alternate orientations.  Most are site-constrained, or have already
been built.  
 
? There are perhaps a greater fraction than 10% of all buildings that
can take advantage of alternate glass distributions, however glass
distribution is also often constrained by site considerations.
 
? So to accommodate a minority of cases, LEED 2.2 / 90.1-2004 Appendix
G seems to impose a significant and relatively meaningless calculation
burden on the majority, by requiring the development of a fictitious
baseline that needs to be manually maintained outside of the simulation
software.
 
? How can we waive these requirements in LEED 2.2 for projects that
cannot realistically benefit from them, and substitute a "code minimum"
baseline oriented identically and glazed similarly to the proposed
building? 
 
 
On the last point, even if a site-constrained project could
'theoretically' benefit from orientation averaging or fenestration
leveling, in principle I believe LEED teams should have the option to
forgo that marginal benefit the sake of the simplicity, clarity,
accuracy, and meaningfulness of the comparative calculations.
 
 
 
Thanks for your time, and hard work on LEED...

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] App G 2004 question

One of the perceived shortcomings of Ch. 11 as a method for computing
energy savings for green building rating purposes was that it did not
provide sufficient opportunity to take credit for energy savings through
envelope design and building orientation on the site.  The cited portion
of Ch. 11 (Table 11.3, item 5) requires all envelope components of the
Budget Building to be the same as the Proposed Building, eliminating
that opportunity.

The parallel part of Appendix G relaxes this constraint in a way that
should make it possible for the Proposed Building to show a greater
reduction in energy cost.  This is done by removing self-shading,
distributing fenestration uniformly instead of optimally, and by
averaging the effects of orientation.  If someone has done a robust test
of orientation averaging vs. best and worst case orientations that shows
negligible scatter around the mean, I am sure the ECB Subcommittee would
be interested to see it.  

The distribution of glazing was made uniform mainly because of the
intent to average multiple orientations.

As clarification, LEED v2.2 requires the use of the Performance Rating
Method from Appendix G, not the ECB method (which was used in previous
versions of LEED).  In fact, in the Reference Guide section of LEED v2.2
titled ?Common mistakes made using the Performance Rating Method?, the
first mistake listed is ?The Energy Cost Budget Method (Section 11) is
incorrectly used rather than the Performance Rating Method (Appendix G)
to obtain EA Credit 1 credit?. 
 
Brandon ? when I first read Appendix G, I was puzzled by their
motivation.  Why rotate the building if you are already evenly
distributing glass?  I am still not sure what the justification from
ASHRAE is on that one.  I have not seen anything from USGBC that gives
any exceptions to the rotating requirement.

The Appendix G is an informative appendix and is not part of Standard
90.1. It is merely informative and does not contain requirements
necessary for conformance to the Standard.
 
In the  Energy Cost Budget Method section in Table 11.3 under Section 5
Building Envelope, it describes the requirements for the Proposed
Building design and the Budget Building design.  The first paragraph
under the Budget Building design states.... The budget building shall
have identical conditioned floor area and identical exterior dimensions
and orientations as the proposed design, except as noted in (a), (b),
and (c) in this clause. 
 
There's nothing in the Standard stating you must rotate the building in
90 degree increments and average the results. We've never been asked to
do it to my knowledge by the USGBC during a LEED review of our
projects.

All,
 
This is an old thread, but one I thought worth revisiting to see if
there have been any developments.  Specifically we are preparing a LEED
Silver project for submittal, and while we understand he intent of the
Appendix G 'multiple-orientation' and 'fenestration-leveling'
requirements, our evaluation is that they impose extensive calculation
requirements for arguably marginal returns on accuracy.
 
In the case of our specific building (as I would suspect the case of
90%+ of all buildings) there's simply no latitude to change the
orientation.  Similarly with glass distribution, the lobby and entryway
have the flexibility to be on one side and one side only of the
building, and thus distributing the glass equally amongst all facets for
the baseline model seems to add an unnecessary level of abstraction to
the comparative analyses.
 
Does imposing the requirement for analysts to spend considerable effort
developing fictitious baselines based on building orientations and glass
distributions that have 0% chance of construction seem to be a
reasonable requisite for LEED project certifications?  What I mean by
'considerable effort' is:
 
? That the all baseline numbers for each of the four orientations would
need to be extracted from the analysis software, averaged on a
spreadsheet, and a similar extraction done for all subsequent energy
efficiency measure (EEM) comparisons.  Posting these numbers from
analysis software to spreadsheets would be both time-consuming and
introduce another level of potential error, and thus require additional
error-checking.  
 
? That a new building would need to be developed, with glass
redistributed equally amongst all facets, for the four-point orientation
exercise described above.  Again, while this may sound reasonable from a
theoretical standpoint, practically speaking this requirement serves to
decouple the baseline from glazing-dependent energy efficiency measures.
 How meaningful is changing the U-value or shading coefficient of the
glass in an EEM in comparison to a fictitious baseline, when the glass
distribution is crucial to determining whether or not the measure is
cost-effective?  As with building orientations, posting these numbers
from analysis software to spreadsheets would be both time-consuming and
additionally error-prone. 
 
All to fulfill the requirement of deriving a fictitious baseline for
use in the comparative analyses -- no doubt these requirements were
incorporated with good intention, but practical implementation
considerations seem to have not been considered carefully enough.
 
Further, we find the concept of comparing proposed energy efficiency
measures to a "code minimum" baseline building, oriented identically and
glazed similarly to each of the EEMs, to be intuitively more meaningful
to both the owner and project team (and thus presumably to the LEED
reviewer) than comparison to a fictitious baseline.  This approach
allows the baseline to reside in the analysis software, and EEM
comparisons accomplished using the built-in 'parametric run' features of
the analysis software (eQuest and others) to reduce the time-consuming
error-prone tediousness of extracting and posting numbers to a
spreadsheet for comparative evaluation.
 
Has anyone had success in obtaining LEED project approval when
excepting these 'building orientation averaging' and 'glazing-area
leveling' requirements?  What is required in terms of the LEED
application to waive these requirements?
 
Also, does anyone know if these requirements have been identified for
relaxation or revision in the next LEED update?

Peter,
 
I believe the intent is to give you a way to get some savings from
orienting your building with an eye toward savings. If you pay
attention
to the sun in your design (passive solar and/or daylighting), you
should
get some savings relative to the average of the rotated orientations.
Similarly, you could get a penalty if you have too much west-facing
glass.
 
I'm not sure how strictly this provision is being enforced. Most of
the
modelers I have spoken to ignore it, but that is a very unscientific
sample.
These modelers may not be submitting to USGBC.
 
For a utility incentive program, it often does not make sense to do
this
rotation. Those incentive programs typically care about the savings
from
incremental changes to the design, particularly those changes that
carry
an incremental cost. I'm not sure how one would determine an
incremental
cost for your building's orientation, so it is not a factor that would
typically be eligible.

I have a question about the Appendix G in 90.1, 2004.
In Table G3.1 the baseline building is to be simulated as follows:
" Orientation. The baseline building performance shall be generated by
simulating the building with its actual orientation and again after
rotating the entire building 90, 180, 270 degrees, then averaging the
results. The building shall be modeled so that it does not shade
itself."
What does --- the building shall be modeled so that it does not shade
itself ---- mean?
Does it mean that if there is, for example, an L shaped building
(which
self shades), it has to be modeled as square? rectangle?
Any thoughts on this appreciated.
 
Thanks

The overall window U-factor is usually not significantly higher than center
of glass (cog) one.  It is only significantly higher if the frame U-factor
is significantly higher then cog U-factor and if spacer is highly
conductive.  This is typically true for Aluminum framed windows and Aluminum
spacers.  If you know frame U-factor and spacer material you can simply
calculate overall window U-factor by doing area weighting using the
following formula
 
U = (Af*Uf + Aeog*Ueog + Acog*Ucog)/A
 
where,
 
Af = total projected frame area
Uf = frame U-factor
Acog = Ag - (W-0.127)*(H-0.127)
Wg = exposed glazing width
Hg = exposed glazing height
Ag = Area of exposed glazing
Ag = W*H
Aeog = Ag-Acog
Ucog = center of glass U-factor
Ueog = edge of glass U-factor
A = Total window area
 
Uf and Ueog is usually determined using 2-D numerical analysis.  There are
number of numerical tools for this but the best one and easiest to use is
THERM program (windows.lbl.gov).  You will also need WINDOW program (same
web site) to prepare glazing system for THERM.  However, this is
time-consuming process and it requires that you know all of the details of
glazing, spacer and frame.  If you don't have those details and you don't
need absolute accuracy, easy way to get Ueog is to look in ASHRAE Handbook
of Fundamentals from one of prior years and to read Ueog from Figure Ueog
vs. Ucog (Figure 6 in 1989 Fundamentals).  If you don't have access to this
book, let me know and I will send you scanned Figure.
 
Note: The above formula is a simplified version of the full window U-factor
calculation formula, and it assumes that all of the Uf and Ueog are the same
regardless of the position in a window (i.e., jambs, sill, head, mullion,
etc.).  In your case, with not having all of the details, this formula is
appropriate.  Otherwise, members in the above formula are under summation
signs, since each component of a window is accounted for separately.
 
Use of ISO 10077 standards is not appropriate here because we use different
boundary conditions, so unless this is for some calculations in Europe I
would strongly advise not to use these standards.

Hi Aaron,

The overall U-value is usually significantly higher than the centre-pane
U-value. In order to estimate the overall U-value of curtain walls or
windows you need to include the frames U-values and the edge effects and the
additional effect of point thermal bridges if present (structural
connections through the facade or window).

 

You may find some guidance in the NFRC standards
http://www.nfrc.org/technicaldocs.aspx  and you may use the software THERM
(downloadable from the LBNL website http://windows.lbl.gov/software/ ) to
calculate the U-value + edge effects of frames. 

You may also find some guidance in the EN ISO 10077-1 and EN ISO 10077-2
which define a different method from the NFRC one, also the first one gives
simplified method and includes a table with pre-calculated linear thermal
transmittances (edge effect).

 

I hope it helps.

You may also find some guidance in the EN ISO 10077-1 and EN ISO 10077-2
which define a different method from the NFRC one, also the first one
gives simplified method and includes a table with pre-calculated linear
thermal transmittances (edge effect).

 

I hope it helps.

The baseline building is rotated to negate the effects of orientation,
ie, you get the benefit in your proposed design for GOOD site
orientation.  One of the least expensive energy saving strategies is to
orient your building correctly, and if you have a good aspect ratio the
effects are even better.  
 
Of course there are other issues that go into site selection, but for
those project teams that are looking at the design holistically, they
get the benefit. 
 
I would put forth that many more than 10% of commercial buildings have
lots of site flexibility.  Remember about 80% of commercial construction
is 3 stories or less and is being built in low density collar counties.

Thanks Bill & Bing for your replies,
 
 
Previously I started this topic going again with a point-by-point
description of some implementation problems caused by the 'orientation
averaging' and 'fenestration leveling' requirements of LEED 2.2 /
90.1-2004 Appendix G; please refer to that post for further details.  
 
 
Here let me try to be as clear and concise as possible:
 
* There are, perhaps, only 10% of all buildings that can take advantage
of alternate orientations.  Most are site-constrained, or have already
been built.  
 
* There are perhaps a greater fraction than 10% of all buildings that
can take advantage of alternate glass distributions, however glass
distribution is also often constrained by site considerations.
 
* So to accommodate a minority of cases, LEED 2.2 / 90.1-2004 Appendix G
seems to impose a significant and relatively meaningless calculation
burden on the majority, by requiring the development of a fictitious
baseline that needs to be manually maintained outside of the simulation
software.
 
* How can we waive these requirements in LEED 2.2 for projects that
cannot realistically benefit from them, and substitute a "code minimum"
baseline oriented identically and glazed similarly to the proposed
building? 
 
 
On the last point, even if a site-constrained project could
'theoretically' benefit from orientation averaging or fenestration
leveling, in principle I believe LEED teams should have the option to
forgo that marginal benefit the sake of the simplicity, clarity,
accuracy, and meaningfulness of the comparative calculations.
 
 
 
Thanks for your time, and hard work on LEED...

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] App G 2004 question



As clarification, LEED v2.2 requires the use of the Performance Rating
Method from Appendix G, not the ECB method (which was used in previous
versions of LEED).  In fact, in the Reference Guide section of LEED v2.2
titled "Common mistakes made using the Performance Rating Method", the
first mistake listed is "The Energy Cost Budget Method (Section 11) is
incorrectly used rather than the Performance Rating Method (Appendix G)
to obtain EA Credit 1 credit". 

 

Brandon - when I first read Appendix G, I was puzzled by their
motivation.  Why rotate the building if you are already evenly
distributing glass?  I am still not sure what the justification from
ASHRAE is on that one.  I have not seen anything from USGBC that gives
any exceptions to the rotating requirement.

The Appendix G is an informative appendix and is not part of Standard
90.1. It is merely informative and does not contain requirements
necessary for conformance to the Standard.

 

In the  Energy Cost Budget Method section in Table 11.3 under Section 5
Building Envelope, it describes the requirements for the Proposed
Building design and the Budget Building design.  The first paragraph
under the Budget Building design states.... The budget building shall
have identical conditioned floor area and identical exterior dimensions
and orientations as the proposed design, except as noted in (a), (b),
and (c) in this clause. 

 

There's nothing in the Standard stating you must rotate the building in
90 degree increments and average the results. We've never been asked to
do it to my knowledge by the USGBC during a LEED review of our projects.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] App G 2004 question

All,

 

This is an old thread, but one I thought worth revisiting to see if
there have been any developments.  Specifically we are preparing a LEED
Silver project for submittal, and while we understand he intent of the
Appendix G 'multiple-orientation' and 'fenestration-leveling'
requirements, our evaluation is that they impose extensive calculation
requirements for arguably marginal returns on accuracy.

 

In the case of our specific building (as I would suspect the case of
90%+ of all buildings) there's simply no latitude to change the
orientation.  Similarly with glass distribution, the lobby and entryway
have the flexibility to be on one side and one side only of the
building, and thus distributing the glass equally amongst all facets for
the baseline model seems to add an unnecessary level of abstraction to
the comparative analyses.

 

Does imposing the requirement for analysts to spend considerable effort
developing fictitious baselines based on building orientations and glass
distributions that have 0% chance of construction seem to be a
reasonable requisite for LEED project certifications?  What I mean by
'considerable effort' is:

 

* That the all baseline numbers for each of the four orientations would
need to be extracted from the analysis software, averaged on a
spreadsheet, and a similar extraction done for all subsequent energy
efficiency measure (EEM) comparisons.  Posting these numbers from
analysis software to spreadsheets would be both time-consuming and
introduce another level of potential error, and thus require additional
error-checking.  

 

* That a new building would need to be developed, with glass
redistributed equally amongst all facets, for the four-point orientation
exercise described above.  Again, while this may sound reasonable from a
theoretical standpoint, practically speaking this requirement serves to
decouple the baseline from glazing-dependent energy efficiency measures.
How meaningful is changing the U-value or shading coefficient of the
glass in an EEM in comparison to a fictitious baseline, when the glass
distribution is crucial to determining whether or not the measure is
cost-effective?  As with building orientations, posting these numbers
from analysis software to spreadsheets would be both time-consuming and
additionally error-prone. 

 

All to fulfill the requirement of deriving a fictitious baseline for use
in the comparative analyses -- no doubt these requirements were
incorporated with good intention, but practical implementation
considerations seem to have not been considered carefully enough.

 

Further, we find the concept of comparing proposed energy efficiency
measures to a "code minimum" baseline building, oriented identically and
glazed similarly to each of the EEMs, to be intuitively more meaningful
to both the owner and project team (and thus presumably to the LEED
reviewer) than comparison to a fictitious baseline.  This approach
allows the baseline to reside in the analysis software, and EEM
comparisons accomplished using the built-in 'parametric run' features of
the analysis software (eQuest and others) to reduce the time-consuming
error-prone tediousness of extracting and posting numbers to a
spreadsheet for comparative evaluation.

 

Has anyone had success in obtaining LEED project approval when excepting
these 'building orientation averaging' and 'glazing-area leveling'
requirements?  What is required in terms of the LEED application to
waive these requirements?

 

Also, does anyone know if these requirements have been identified for
relaxation or revision in the next LEED update?

	In Table G3.1 the baseline building is to be simulated as

	" Orientation. The baseline building performance shall be

after
	rotating the entire building 90, 180, 270 degrees, then

	What does --- the building shall be modeled so that it does not

	Does it mean that if there is, for example, an L shaped building
(which

	Any thoughts on this appreciated.

Call the manufacturer.  They should be able to give you whole unit U-values

I think that Window5 software from LBL can do this as well but a phone call

Hi Aaron,

The overall U-value is usually significantly higher than the centre-pane
U-value. In order to estimate the overall U-value of curtain walls or
windows you need to include the frames U-values and the edge effects and
the additional effect of point thermal bridges if present (structural
connections through the facade or window).

 

You may find some guidance in the NFRC standards
http://www.nfrc.org/technicaldocs.aspx  and you may use the software
THERM (downloadable from the LBNL website
http://windows.lbl.gov/software/ ) to calculate the U-value + edge
effects of frames. 

You may also find some guidance in the EN ISO 10077-1 and EN ISO 10077-2
which define a different method from the NFRC one, also the first one
gives simplified method and includes a table with pre-calculated linear
thermal transmittances (edge effect).

 

I hope it helps.

Best regards,

Annalisa.

We just used the PRM on a gut rehab job, and I would interpret Table
G3.1.5 (f) "Existing Buildings. For existing building envelopes, the
baseline building design shall reflect existing conditions prior to any
revisions that are part of the scope of work being evaluated" to
over-ride paragraphs (a) - (e) above it, one of which includes the
rotation.

 

So, one would not apply the rotation to that type of evaluation.

To follow up this issue, I also have a question here: 

For existing buildings (e,g, tenant fit-out), is it necessary to rotate
the baseline building since the building is already built?   

 

Thanks.

Charlie and Brandon,

The motivation and justification for rotating the baseline building in
Appendix G can be found in the 90.1-2004 User's Manual (example G-C
Fenestration). Here are two reasons why rotate the baseline building:

 

1. To give credit and reward if the proposed building is designed to
have the majority of windows facing either south or north. 

 

2. If the building is configured in such a way that it is capable of
shading itself (e.g. "L" or "U" shaped), this self shading is not
modeled in the baseline building.  

 

Thanks,

Bing

As clarification, LEED v2.2 requires the use of the Performance Rating
Method from Appendix G, not the ECB method (which was used in previous
versions of LEED).  In fact, in the Reference Guide section of LEED v2.2
titled ?Common mistakes made using the Performance Rating Method?, the
first mistake listed is ?The Energy Cost Budget Method (Section 11) is
incorrectly used rather than the Performance Rating Method (Appendix G)
to obtain EA Credit 1 credit?. 

 

Brandon ? when I first read Appendix G, I was puzzled by their
motivation.  Why rotate the building if you are already evenly
distributing glass?  I am still not sure what the justification from
ASHRAE is on that one.  I have not seen anything from USGBC that gives
any exceptions to the rotating requirement.

The Appendix G is an informative appendix and is not part of Standard
90.1. It is merely informative and does not contain requirements
necessary for conformance to the Standard.

 

In the  Energy Cost Budget Method section in Table 11.3 under Section 5
Building Envelope, it describes the requirements for the Proposed
Building design and the Budget Building design.  The first paragraph
under the Budget Building design states.... The budget building shall
have identical conditioned floor area and identical exterior dimensions
and orientations as the proposed design, except as noted in (a), (b),
and (c) in this clause. 

 

There's nothing in the Standard stating you must rotate the building in
90 degree increments and average the results. We've never been asked to
do it to my knowledge by the USGBC during a LEED review of our projects.

All,

 

This is an old thread, but one I thought worth revisiting to see if
there have been any developments.  Specifically we are preparing a LEED
Silver project for submittal, and while we understand he intent of the
Appendix G 'multiple-orientation' and 'fenestration-leveling'
requirements, our evaluation is that they impose extensive calculation
requirements for arguably marginal returns on accuracy.

 

In the case of our specific building (as I would suspect the case of
90%+ of all buildings) there's simply no latitude to change the
orientation.  Similarly with glass distribution, the lobby and entryway
have the flexibility to be on one side and one side only of the
building, and thus distributing the glass equally amongst all facets for
the baseline model seems to add an unnecessary level of abstraction to
the comparative analyses.

 

Does imposing the requirement for analysts to spend considerable effort
developing fictitious baselines based on building orientations and glass
distributions that have 0% chance of construction seem to be a
reasonable requisite for LEED project certifications?  What I mean by
'considerable effort' is:

 

? That the all baseline numbers for each of the four orientations would
need to be extracted from the analysis software, averaged on a
spreadsheet, and a similar extraction done for all subsequent energy
efficiency measure (EEM) comparisons.  Posting these numbers from
analysis software to spreadsheets would be both time-consuming and
introduce another level of potential error, and thus require additional
error-checking.  

 

? That a new building would need to be developed, with glass
redistributed equally amongst all facets, for the four-point orientation
exercise described above.  Again, while this may sound reasonable from a
theoretical standpoint, practically speaking this requirement serves to
decouple the baseline from glazing-dependent energy efficiency measures.
How meaningful is changing the U-value or shading coefficient of the
glass in an EEM in comparison to a fictitious baseline, when the glass
distribution is crucial to determining whether or not the measure is
cost-effective?  As with building orientations, posting these numbers
from analysis software to spreadsheets would be both time-consuming and
additionally error-prone. 

 

All to fulfill the requirement of deriving a fictitious baseline for use
in the comparative analyses -- no doubt these requirements were
incorporated with good intention, but practical implementation
considerations seem to have not been considered carefully enough.

 

Further, we find the concept of comparing proposed energy efficiency
measures to a "code minimum" baseline building, oriented identically and
glazed similarly to each of the EEMs, to be intuitively more meaningful
to both the owner and project team (and thus presumably to the LEED
reviewer) than comparison to a fictitious baseline.  This approach
allows the baseline to reside in the analysis software, and EEM
comparisons accomplished using the built-in 'parametric run' features of
the analysis software (eQuest and others) to reduce the time-consuming
error-prone tediousness of extracting and posting numbers to a
spreadsheet for comparative evaluation.

 

Has anyone had success in obtaining LEED project approval when excepting
these 'building orientation averaging' and 'glazing-area leveling'
requirements?  What is required in terms of the LEED application to
waive these requirements?

 

Also, does anyone know if these requirements have been identified for
relaxation or revision in the next LEED update?

   Peter,
    
   I believe the intent is to give you a way to get some savings from
   orienting your building with an eye toward savings. If you pay
   attention
   to the sun in your design (passive solar and/or daylighting), you
   should
   get some savings relative to the average of the rotated orientations.
   Similarly, you could get a penalty if you have too much west-facing
   glass.
    
   I'm not sure how strictly this provision is being enforced. Most of
   the
   modelers I have spoken to ignore it, but that is a very unscientific
   sample.
   These modelers may not be submitting to USGBC.
    
   For a utility incentive program, it often does not make sense to do
   this
   rotation. Those incentive programs typically care about the savings
   from
   incremental changes to the design, particularly those changes that
   carry
   an incremental cost. I'm not sure how one would determine an
   incremental
   cost for your building's orientation, so it is not a factor that
   would
   typically be eligible.

   I have a question about the Appendix G in 90.1, 2004.
   In Table G3.1 the baseline building is to be simulated as follows:
   " Orientation. The baseline building performance shall be generated
   by
   simulating the building with its actual orientation and again after
   rotating the entire building 90, 180, 270 degrees, then averaging the
   results. The building shall be modeled so that it does not shade
   itself."
   What does --- the building shall be modeled so that it does not shade
   itself ---- mean?
   Does it mean that if there is, for example, an L shaped building
   (which
   self shades), it has to be modeled as square? rectangle?
   Any thoughts on this appreciated.
    
   Thanks

Thanks Bill & Bing for your replies,
 
 
Previously I started this topic going again with a point-by-point
description of some implementation problems caused by the 'orientation
averaging' and 'fenestration leveling' requirements of LEED 2.2 /
90.1-2004 Appendix G; please refer to that post for further details.  
 
 
Here let me try to be as clear and concise as possible:
 
* There are, perhaps, only 10% of all buildings that can take advantage
of alternate orientations.  Most are site-constrained, or have already
been built.  
 
* There are perhaps a greater fraction than 10% of all buildings that
can take advantage of alternate glass distributions, however glass
distribution is also often constrained by site considerations.
 
* So to accommodate a minority of cases, LEED 2.2 / 90.1-2004 Appendix G
seems to impose a significant and relatively meaningless calculation
burden on the majority, by requiring the development of a fictitious
baseline that needs to be manually maintained outside of the simulation
software.
 
* How can we waive these requirements in LEED 2.2 for projects that
cannot realistically benefit from them, and substitute a "code minimum"
baseline oriented identically and glazed similarly to the proposed
building? 
 
 
On the last point, even if a site-constrained project could
'theoretically' benefit from orientation averaging or fenestration
leveling, in principle I believe LEED teams should have the option to
forgo that marginal benefit the sake of the simplicity, clarity,
accuracy, and meaningfulness of the comparative calculations.
 
 
 
Thanks for your time, and hard work on LEED...

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] App G 2004 question


One of the perceived shortcomings of Ch. 11 as a method for computing
energy savings for green building rating purposes was that it did not
provide sufficient opportunity to take credit for energy savings through
envelope design and building orientation on the site.  The cited portion
of Ch. 11 (Table 11.3, item 5) requires all envelope components of the
Budget Building to be the same as the Proposed Building, eliminating
that opportunity.

The parallel part of Appendix G relaxes this constraint in a way that
should make it possible for the Proposed Building to show a greater
reduction in energy cost.  This is done by removing self-shading,
distributing fenestration uniformly instead of optimally, and by
averaging the effects of orientation.  If someone has done a robust test
of orientation averaging vs. best and worst case orientations that shows
negligible scatter around the mean, I am sure the ECB Subcommittee would
be interested to see it.  

The distribution of glazing was made uniform mainly because of the
intent to average multiple orientations.

Having to both rotate the building four times as well as distributing
the glass evenly on all sides was really never the intent of Appendix G
(although that is what is published). The original drafts of G had the
rotation requirement as an alternative exception to re-distributing the
glazing and opaque wall area equally on all four sides. During public
review comments the committee agreed to get rid of the redistribution
requirement and maintain the rotation requirement. The thought was that
this would be much easier to implement, and automated software would be
developed to create the Appendix G baseline (someday maybe). Somehow, in
the review and publication process both requirements ended up in the
2004 Appendix G. After publication of the 2004 version, this was amended
through Addendum A to remove the requirement for redistribution and
maintain the requirement for rotation. This will be reflected in the
soon to be released 2007 version of 90.1.  Hope that helps.

Charlie and Brandon,
The motivation and justification for rotating the baseline building in
Appendix G can be found in the 90.1-2004 User's Manual (example G-C
Fenestration). Here are two reasons why rotate the baseline building:
 
1. To give credit and reward if the proposed building is designed to
have the majority of windows facing either south or north. 
 
2. If the building is configured in such a way that it is capable of
shading itself (e.g. "L" or "U" shaped), this self shading is not
modeled in the baseline building.  
 
Thanks,

Bing

As clarification, LEED v2.2 requires the use of the Performance Rating
Method from Appendix G, not the ECB method (which was used in previous
versions of LEED).  In fact, in the Reference Guide section of LEED
v2.2
titled "Common mistakes made using the Performance Rating Method", the
first mistake listed is "The Energy Cost Budget Method (Section 11) is
incorrectly used rather than the Performance Rating Method (Appendix
G)
to obtain EA Credit 1 credit". 

 

Brandon - when I first read Appendix G, I was puzzled by their
motivation.  Why rotate the building if you are already evenly
distributing glass?  I am still not sure what the justification from
ASHRAE is on that one.  I have not seen anything from USGBC that gives
any exceptions to the rotating requirement.

The Appendix G is an informative appendix and is not part of Standard
90.1. It is merely informative and does not contain requirements
necessary for conformance to the Standard.

 

In the  Energy Cost Budget Method section in Table 11.3 under Section
5
Building Envelope, it describes the requirements for the Proposed
Building design and the Budget Building design.  The first paragraph
under the Budget Building design states.... The budget building shall
have identical conditioned floor area and identical exterior
dimensions
and orientations as the proposed design, except as noted in (a), (b),
and (c) in this clause. 

 

There's nothing in the Standard stating you must rotate the building
in
90 degree increments and average the results. We've never been asked
to
do it to my knowledge by the USGBC during a LEED review of our
projects.

All,

 

This is an old thread, but one I thought worth revisiting to see if
there have been any developments.  Specifically we are preparing a
LEED
Silver project for submittal, and while we understand he intent of the
Appendix G 'multiple-orientation' and 'fenestration-leveling'
requirements, our evaluation is that they impose extensive calculation
requirements for arguably marginal returns on accuracy.

 

In the case of our specific building (as I would suspect the case of
90%+ of all buildings) there's simply no latitude to change the
orientation.  Similarly with glass distribution, the lobby and
entryway
have the flexibility to be on one side and one side only of the
building, and thus distributing the glass equally amongst all facets
for
the baseline model seems to add an unnecessary level of abstraction to
the comparative analyses.

 

Does imposing the requirement for analysts to spend considerable
effort
developing fictitious baselines based on building orientations and
glass
distributions that have 0% chance of construction seem to be a
reasonable requisite for LEED project certifications?  What I mean by
'considerable effort' is:

 

* That the all baseline numbers for each of the four orientations
would
need to be extracted from the analysis software, averaged on a
spreadsheet, and a similar extraction done for all subsequent energy
efficiency measure (EEM) comparisons.  Posting these numbers from
analysis software to spreadsheets would be both time-consuming and
introduce another level of potential error, and thus require
additional
error-checking.  

 

* That a new building would need to be developed, with glass
redistributed equally amongst all facets, for the four-point
orientation
exercise described above.  Again, while this may sound reasonable from
a
theoretical standpoint, practically speaking this requirement serves
to
decouple the baseline from glazing-dependent energy efficiency
measures.
How meaningful is changing the U-value or shading coefficient of the
glass in an EEM in comparison to a fictitious baseline, when the glass
distribution is crucial to determining whether or not the measure is
cost-effective?  As with building orientations, posting these numbers
from analysis software to spreadsheets would be both time-consuming
and
additionally error-prone. 

 

All to fulfill the requirement of deriving a fictitious baseline for
use
in the comparative analyses -- no doubt these requirements were
incorporated with good intention, but practical implementation
considerations seem to have not been considered carefully enough.

 

Further, we find the concept of comparing proposed energy efficiency
measures to a "code minimum" baseline building, oriented identically
and
glazed similarly to each of the EEMs, to be intuitively more
meaningful
to both the owner and project team (and thus presumably to the LEED
reviewer) than comparison to a fictitious baseline.  This approach
allows the baseline to reside in the analysis software, and EEM
comparisons accomplished using the built-in 'parametric run' features
of
the analysis software (eQuest and others) to reduce the time-consuming
error-prone tediousness of extracting and posting numbers to a
spreadsheet for comparative evaluation.

 

Has anyone had success in obtaining LEED project approval when
excepting
these 'building orientation averaging' and 'glazing-area leveling'
requirements?  What is required in terms of the LEED application to
waive these requirements?

 

Also, does anyone know if these requirements have been identified for
relaxation or revision in the next LEED update?

To follow up this issue, I also have a question here: 

For existing buildings (e,g, tenant fit-out), is it necessary to rotate
the baseline building since the building is already built?   

 

Thanks.

Charlie and Brandon,

The motivation and justification for rotating the baseline building in
Appendix G can be found in the 90.1-2004 User's Manual (example G-C
Fenestration). Here are two reasons why rotate the baseline building:

 

1. To give credit and reward if the proposed building is designed to
have the majority of windows facing either south or north. 

 

2. If the building is configured in such a way that it is capable of
shading itself (e.g. "L" or "U" shaped), this self shading is not
modeled in the baseline building.  

 

Thanks,

Bing

As clarification, LEED v2.2 requires the use of the Performance Rating
Method from Appendix G, not the ECB method (which was used in previous
versions of LEED).  In fact, in the Reference Guide section of LEED v2.2
titled "Common mistakes made using the Performance Rating Method", the
first mistake listed is "The Energy Cost Budget Method (Section 11) is
incorrectly used rather than the Performance Rating Method (Appendix G)
to obtain EA Credit 1 credit". 

 

Brandon - when I first read Appendix G, I was puzzled by their
motivation.  Why rotate the building if you are already evenly
distributing glass?  I am still not sure what the justification from
ASHRAE is on that one.  I have not seen anything from USGBC that gives
any exceptions to the rotating requirement.

The Appendix G is an informative appendix and is not part of Standard
90.1. It is merely informative and does not contain requirements
necessary for conformance to the Standard.

 

In the  Energy Cost Budget Method section in Table 11.3 under Section 5
Building Envelope, it describes the requirements for the Proposed
Building design and the Budget Building design.  The first paragraph
under the Budget Building design states.... The budget building shall
have identical conditioned floor area and identical exterior dimensions
and orientations as the proposed design, except as noted in (a), (b),
and (c) in this clause. 

 

There's nothing in the Standard stating you must rotate the building in
90 degree increments and average the results. We've never been asked to
do it to my knowledge by the USGBC during a LEED review of our projects.

All,

 

This is an old thread, but one I thought worth revisiting to see if
there have been any developments.  Specifically we are preparing a LEED
Silver project for submittal, and while we understand he intent of the
Appendix G 'multiple-orientation' and 'fenestration-leveling'
requirements, our evaluation is that they impose extensive calculation
requirements for arguably marginal returns on accuracy.

 

In the case of our specific building (as I would suspect the case of
90%+ of all buildings) there's simply no latitude to change the
orientation.  Similarly with glass distribution, the lobby and entryway
have the flexibility to be on one side and one side only of the
building, and thus distributing the glass equally amongst all facets for
the baseline model seems to add an unnecessary level of abstraction to
the comparative analyses.

 

Does imposing the requirement for analysts to spend considerable effort
developing fictitious baselines based on building orientations and glass
distributions that have 0% chance of construction seem to be a
reasonable requisite for LEED project certifications?  What I mean by
'considerable effort' is:

 

* That the all baseline numbers for each of the four orientations would
need to be extracted from the analysis software, averaged on a
spreadsheet, and a similar extraction done for all subsequent energy
efficiency measure (EEM) comparisons.  Posting these numbers from
analysis software to spreadsheets would be both time-consuming and
introduce another level of potential error, and thus require additional
error-checking.  

 

* That a new building would need to be developed, with glass
redistributed equally amongst all facets, for the four-point orientation
exercise described above.  Again, while this may sound reasonable from a
theoretical standpoint, practically speaking this requirement serves to
decouple the baseline from glazing-dependent energy efficiency measures.
How meaningful is changing the U-value or shading coefficient of the
glass in an EEM in comparison to a fictitious baseline, when the glass
distribution is crucial to determining whether or not the measure is
cost-effective?  As with building orientations, posting these numbers
from analysis software to spreadsheets would be both time-consuming and
additionally error-prone. 

 

All to fulfill the requirement of deriving a fictitious baseline for use
in the comparative analyses -- no doubt these requirements were
incorporated with good intention, but practical implementation
considerations seem to have not been considered carefully enough.

 

Further, we find the concept of comparing proposed energy efficiency
measures to a "code minimum" baseline building, oriented identically and
glazed similarly to each of the EEMs, to be intuitively more meaningful
to both the owner and project team (and thus presumably to the LEED
reviewer) than comparison to a fictitious baseline.  This approach
allows the baseline to reside in the analysis software, and EEM
comparisons accomplished using the built-in 'parametric run' features of
the analysis software (eQuest and others) to reduce the time-consuming
error-prone tediousness of extracting and posting numbers to a
spreadsheet for comparative evaluation.

 

Has anyone had success in obtaining LEED project approval when excepting
these 'building orientation averaging' and 'glazing-area leveling'
requirements?  What is required in terms of the LEED application to
waive these requirements?

 

Also, does anyone know if these requirements have been identified for
relaxation or revision in the next LEED update?

	Peter,
	 
	I believe the intent is to give you a way to get some savings
from
	orienting your building with an eye toward savings. If you pay
attention
	to the sun in your design (passive solar and/or daylighting),
you should
	get some savings relative to the average of the rotated
orientations.
	Similarly, you could get a penalty if you have too much
west-facing
	glass.
	 
	I'm not sure how strictly this provision is being enforced. Most
of the
	modelers I have spoken to ignore it, but that is a very
unscientific
	sample.
	These modelers may not be submitting to USGBC.
	 
	For a utility incentive program, it often does not make sense to
do this
	rotation. Those incentive programs typically care about the
savings from
	incremental changes to the design, particularly those changes
that carry
	an incremental cost. I'm not sure how one would determine an
incremental
	cost for your building's orientation, so it is not a factor that
would
	typically be eligible.

	I have a question about the Appendix G in 90.1, 2004.
	In Table G3.1 the baseline building is to be simulated as
follows:
	" Orientation. The baseline building performance shall be
generated by
	simulating the building with its actual orientation and again
after
	rotating the entire building 90, 180, 270 degrees, then
averaging the
	results. The building shall be modeled so that it does not shade

	What does --- the building shall be modeled so that it does not
shade
	itself ---- mean?
	Does it mean that if there is, for example, an L shaped building
(which
	self shades), it has to be modeled as square? rectangle?
	Any thoughts on this appreciated.

Appendix G is the required method for demonstrating LEED energy credits
and the submittal requirements for EAC1 include energy end use for each
orientation. A90.1-2004 Addendum A modified Section G4.1.c to indicate
that the baseline building fenestration area should be equivalent to the
proposed (or 40% max) and 'shall be distributed on each face of the
building in the same proportion as on the Proposed Design.' The uniform
horizontal bands are no longer required which should help simplify the
process a little if USGBC/LEED is willing to adopt the addendum.

I believe the intent is to give you a way to get some savings from
orienting your building with an eye toward savings. If you pay attention
to the sun in your design (passive solar and/or daylighting), you should
get some savings relative to the average of the rotated orientations.
Similarly, you could get a penalty if you have too much west-facing
glass. I'm not sure how strictly this provision is being enforced. Most
of the modelers I have spoken to ignore it, but that is a very
unscientific sample. These modelers may not be submitting to USGBC. For
a utility incentive program, it often does not make sense to do this
rotation. Those incentive programs typically care about the savings from
incremental changes to the design, particularly those changes that carry
an incremental cost. I'm not sure how one would determine an incremental
cost for your building's orientation, so it is not a factor that would
typically be eligible. Kevin Warren, P.E., CEM, LEED AP Warren Energy

rotating the entire building 90, 180, 270 degrees, then averaging the

Charlie and Brandon,
The motivation and justification for rotating the baseline building in
Appendix G can be found in the 90.1-2004 User's Manual (example G-C
Fenestration). Here are two reasons why rotate the baseline building:
 
1. To give credit and reward if the proposed building is designed to
have the majority of windows facing either south or north. 
 
2. If the building is configured in such a way that it is capable of
shading itself (e.g. "L" or "U" shaped), this self shading is not
modeled in the baseline building.  
 
Thanks,

Bing

As clarification, LEED v2.2 requires the use of the Performance Rating
Method from Appendix G, not the ECB method (which was used in previous
versions of LEED).  In fact, in the Reference Guide section of LEED v2.2
titled "Common mistakes made using the Performance Rating Method", the
first mistake listed is "The Energy Cost Budget Method (Section 11) is
incorrectly used rather than the Performance Rating Method (Appendix G)
to obtain EA Credit 1 credit". 

 

Brandon - when I first read Appendix G, I was puzzled by their
motivation.  Why rotate the building if you are already evenly
distributing glass?  I am still not sure what the justification from
ASHRAE is on that one.  I have not seen anything from USGBC that gives
any exceptions to the rotating requirement.

All,

 

This is an old thread, but one I thought worth revisiting to see if
there have been any developments.  Specifically we are preparing a LEED
Silver project for submittal, and while we understand he intent of the
Appendix G 'multiple-orientation' and 'fenestration-leveling'
requirements, our evaluation is that they impose extensive calculation
requirements for arguably marginal returns on accuracy.

 

In the case of our specific building (as I would suspect the case of
90%+ of all buildings) there's simply no latitude to change the
orientation.  Similarly with glass distribution, the lobby and entryway
have the flexibility to be on one side and one side only of the
building, and thus distributing the glass equally amongst all facets for
the baseline model seems to add an unnecessary level of abstraction to
the comparative analyses.

 

Does imposing the requirement for analysts to spend considerable effort
developing fictitious baselines based on building orientations and glass
distributions that have 0% chance of construction seem to be a
reasonable requisite for LEED project certifications?  What I mean by
'considerable effort' is:

 

* That the all baseline numbers for each of the four orientations would
need to be extracted from the analysis software, averaged on a
spreadsheet, and a similar extraction done for all subsequent energy
efficiency measure (EEM) comparisons.  Posting these numbers from
analysis software to spreadsheets would be both time-consuming and
introduce another level of potential error, and thus require additional
error-checking.  

 

* That a new building would need to be developed, with glass
redistributed equally amongst all facets, for the four-point orientation
exercise described above.  Again, while this may sound reasonable from a
theoretical standpoint, practically speaking this requirement serves to
decouple the baseline from glazing-dependent energy efficiency measures.
How meaningful is changing the U-value or shading coefficient of the
glass in an EEM in comparison to a fictitious baseline, when the glass
distribution is crucial to determining whether or not the measure is
cost-effective?  As with building orientations, posting these numbers
from analysis software to spreadsheets would be both time-consuming and
additionally error-prone. 

 

All to fulfill the requirement of deriving a fictitious baseline for use
in the comparative analyses -- no doubt these requirements were
incorporated with good intention, but practical implementation
considerations seem to have not been considered carefully enough.

 

Further, we find the concept of comparing proposed energy efficiency
measures to a "code minimum" baseline building, oriented identically and
glazed similarly to each of the EEMs, to be intuitively more meaningful
to both the owner and project team (and thus presumably to the LEED
reviewer) than comparison to a fictitious baseline.  This approach
allows the baseline to reside in the analysis software, and EEM
comparisons accomplished using the built-in 'parametric run' features of
the analysis software (eQuest and others) to reduce the time-consuming
error-prone tediousness of extracting and posting numbers to a
spreadsheet for comparative evaluation.

 

Has anyone had success in obtaining LEED project approval when excepting
these 'building orientation averaging' and 'glazing-area leveling'
requirements?  What is required in terms of the LEED application to
waive these requirements?

 

Also, does anyone know if these requirements have been identified for
relaxation or revision in the next LEED update?

 

 

Regards

building orientations, posting these numbers from analysis software to
spreadsheets would be both time-consuming and additionally error-prone. 

 

All to fulfill the requirement of deriving a fictitious baseline for use in
the comparative analyses -- no doubt these requirements were incorporated
with good intention, but practical implementation considerations seem to
have not been considered carefully enough.

 

Further, we find the concept of comparing proposed energy efficiency
measures to a "code minimum" baseline building, oriented identically and
glazed similarly to each of the EEMs, to be intuitively more meaningful to
both the owner and project team (and thus presumably to the LEED reviewer)
than comparison to a fictitious baseline.  This approach allows the baseline
to reside in the analysis software, and EEM comparisons accomplished using
the built-in 'parametric run' features of the analysis software (eQuest and
others) to reduce the time-consuming error-prone tediousness of extracting
and posting numbers to a spreadsheet for comparative evaluation.

 

Has anyone had success in obtaining LEED project approval when excepting
these 'building orientation averaging' and 'glazing-area leveling'
requirements?  What is required in terms of the LEED application to waive
these requirements?

 

Also, does anyone know if these requirements have been identified for
relaxation or revision in the next LEED update?

Peter,
 
I believe the intent is to give you a way to get some savings from
orienting your building with an eye toward savings. If you pay attention
to the sun in your design (passive solar and/or daylighting), you should
get some savings relative to the average of the rotated orientations.
Similarly, you could get a penalty if you have too much west-facing
glass.
 
I'm not sure how strictly this provision is being enforced. Most of the
modelers I have spoken to ignore it, but that is a very unscientific
sample.
These modelers may not be submitting to USGBC.
 
For a utility incentive program, it often does not make sense to do this
rotation. Those incentive programs typically care about the savings from
incremental changes to the design, particularly those changes that carry
an incremental cost. I'm not sure how one would determine an incremental
cost for your building's orientation, so it is not a factor that would
typically be eligible.

I have a question about the Appendix G in 90.1, 2004.
In Table G3.1 the baseline building is to be simulated as follows:
" Orientation. The baseline building performance shall be generated by
simulating the building with its actual orientation and again after
rotating the entire building 90, 180, 270 degrees, then averaging the
results. The building shall be modeled so that it does not shade
itself."
What does --- the building shall be modeled so that it does not shade
itself ---- mean?
Does it mean that if there is, for example, an L shaped building (which
self shades), it has to be modeled as square? rectangle?
Any thoughts on this appreciated.
 
Thanks

The Appendix G is an informative appendix and is not part of Standard
90.1. It is merely informative and does not contain requirements
necessary for conformance to the Standard.
 
In the  Energy Cost Budget Method section in Table 11.3 under Section 5
Building Envelope, it describes the requirements for the Proposed
Building design and the Budget Building design.  The first paragraph
under the Budget Building design states.... The budget building shall
have identical conditioned floor area and identical exterior dimensions
and orientations as the proposed design, except as noted in (a), (b),
and (c) in this clause. 
 
There's nothing in the Standard stating you must rotate the building in
90 degree increments and average the results. We've never been asked to
do it to my knowledge by the USGBC during a LEED review of our projects.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] App G 2004 question


All,
 
This is an old thread, but one I thought worth revisiting to see if
there have been any developments.  Specifically we are preparing a LEED
Silver project for submittal, and while we understand he intent of the
Appendix G 'multiple-orientation' and 'fenestration-leveling'
requirements, our evaluation is that they impose extensive calculation
requirements for arguably marginal returns on accuracy.
 
In the case of our specific building (as I would suspect the case of
90%+ of all buildings) there's simply no latitude to change the
orientation.  Similarly with glass distribution, the lobby and entryway
have the flexibility to be on one side and one side only of the
building, and thus distributing the glass equally amongst all facets for
the baseline model seems to add an unnecessary level of abstraction to
the comparative analyses.
 
Does imposing the requirement for analysts to spend considerable effort
developing fictitious baselines based on building orientations and glass
distributions that have 0% chance of construction seem to be a
reasonable requisite for LEED project certifications?  What I mean by
'considerable effort' is:
 
* That the all baseline numbers for each of the four orientations would
need to be extracted from the analysis software, averaged on a
spreadsheet, and a similar extraction done for all subsequent energy
efficiency measure (EEM) comparisons.  Posting these numbers from
analysis software to spreadsheets would be both time-consuming and
introduce another level of potential error, and thus require additional
error-checking.  
 
* That a new building would need to be developed, with glass
redistributed equally amongst all facets, for the four-point orientation
exercise described above.  Again, while this may sound reasonable from a
theoretical standpoint, practically speaking this requirement serves to
decouple the baseline from glazing-dependent energy efficiency measures.
How meaningful is changing the U-value or shading coefficient of the
glass in an EEM in comparison to a fictitious baseline, when the glass
distribution is crucial to determining whether or not the measure is
cost-effective?  As with building orientations, posting these numbers
from analysis software to spreadsheets would be both time-consuming and
additionally error-prone. 
 
All to fulfill the requirement of deriving a fictitious baseline for use
in the comparative analyses -- no doubt these requirements were

considerations seem to have not been considered carefully enough.
 
Further, we find the concept of comparing proposed energy efficiency

the analysis software (eQuest and others) to reduce the time-consuming

See the last page of the LV-D report for the exterior surfaces summary
(which inexplicably does not include doors -- Jeff & Steve, can total
door area be added to this report?). You may find it easier to go to the
LV-E report in the drop-down list, click somewhere in the report display
area, then hit the 'page up'.

Jannes,

 

You can get monthly average soil surface temperature for any location on
the globe from the NASA link below. This contains 10-year global
climatology of insolation and meteorology data on a 1o x 1o grid system,
you should therefore read through the methodology for developing the SSE
database and accuracy of the dataset, this will you make a judgement on
whether this is appropriate for what you are trying to do.

Janis,
  I am not sure which file formats have the soil surface temperature in
them but TRNSYS is able to read the TMY, TMY2, EnergyPlus, International
Weather for Energy Calculations (IWEC), Canadian Weather for Energy
Calculations (CWEC), or user-format data. The most extensive data for
Europe I believe comes from Meteonorm in TMY2 format and that is not a
format that includes a field for soil surface temperature. If you are
unable to find a source of soil surface temperatures then the two
typical solutions that we have used are to use the Kasuda correlation
(temperature is a function of depth and time of year), or a soil surface
energy balance. Both are available as Types for TRNSYS.
Cheers,

Len,
 
I knew that I would touch sensitive subject.  Actually, we ran number of different simulations using both DOE2 and EnergyPlus and in vast majority of cases for commercial buildings low SHGC products use more energy in climate zones 5 and above than comparable high solar gain products.  One of the reasons that this may not have been the case when ASHRAE 90.1 ran scalar studies, is that it used overly simplified methodology, embedded in a spreadsheet, which assumes constant SHGC and U-factor.  We have shown (and some others, like Jeff Haberl from ESL) that this oversimplification causes errors upwards of 30%!   I have been pointing this to the 90.1 envelope subcommittee for quite some time now, but it pretty much fell on deaf ears and was ignored.
 
The contention that commercial buildings are internal load dominated and that the heating load is not a factor, is a myth, which is easily verified by looking at the DOE energy information agency data, where it is evident that commercial buildings in United States use more energy for heating than for cooling on a national level, which includes all climate zones, such as 1, 2, etc.  If the building stock uses more energy for heating than for cooling when cooling climate zones are accounted for, it is easy to deduce that they are using much more energy for heating than for cooling for climate zones 5 and above.  If the argument is to reduce peak cooling load, then there is some merit in using low solar gain products in the North, but we should be very clear on this.
 
We have developed a new tool EFEN, which calculates energy use of commercial buildings using EnergyPlus simulation engine, and we have interface to WINDOW5 program, so this is all easily verified.  The program is currently in Beta testing, so feel free to check it out at: www.designbuildersoftware.com/efen.php.   The program provides parametric analysis, so you can easily compare different options.
 
Regards,
Charlie

Charlie,
 
(this maybe off topic) 
 
Good point, however, you must remember, that the development of the prescriptive tables in 90.1 is based on a generic office building with an floor plan aspect ratio of 1:1.  it is an internally load dominated building, so even up to climate zone 7 (maybe not 8) in calculating ANNUAL energy consumption, reducing solar heat gain (while allowing some light in for assumed daylighting) was the key factor in the glazing selection that comes out of the model.  Again, it was annual energy consumption.  
 
Prescriptive codes are blunt instruments of change.   I think we all agree that if you change the building aspect ratio, choose good glass/shading and install a daylight harvesting/dimming system, design the interior to take advantage of all of this, you are 70% of the way to a kick ass energy efficient design.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] ASHRAE 90.1 - window SHGC


International Glazing Database (IGDB), which is part of WINDOW 5.2 program (windows.lbl.gov) contains several hundred individual glass layers whose solar transmittance is at or below 0.3, which, as a part of glazing system and whole fenestration product, would produce SHGC of 0.25 or lower, which meets ASHRAE 90.1 for all climate zones.  The best choice for low SHGC windows is so called spectrally selective low-e, and there are at least 100 glass products with this type of low-e coating.  The cost of these products is only marginally higher than the cost of clear glass.
 
I think that you are definitely overlooking something.
 
Having said that, I do want to state that the use of low SHGC products in heating dominated climates (anything at or above climate zone 5) is wrong and is the major flaw of both ASHRAE 90.1 and IECC 2006, particularly for orientations with potentially high solar gain in the winter, such as South orientation.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200704160239.AA3923406pd80001404755@gard.com>

Dear all
 
I am trying to compare models in eQuest and check how well the humidity
is being controlled in the zones.  I entered the humidity control under
the system, "MAX-HUMIDITY = 50".  When I print out the hourly reports
the return humidity always shows up as zero.  Am I missing something?
Has anyone else ever had this problem?
 
Thanks for the help,

We do not have baselines for industries developed.  Right now it would be
incumbent upon the project team to develop a reasonable baseline and then
show savings.  These would then be considered case-by-case.

Marcus,
 
I am just going to have to show my ignorance.  If LEED is trying to
encourage process efficiency  is there then a baseline energy consumption by
industry type that is the basis of the LEED comparison?
 
Until the baselines are developed, the current case is that only low energy
intensity industries need apply for a LEED rating on their building.
 
BTW I agree with the concept of getting a credit relative to a benchmarked
process energy consumption.

Jon,
 
This is a common response we hear from the design community.  The USGBC EA
TAG felt however that if we are trying to address energy usage then all
energy usage should be addressed.  The pound of CO2 generated per kWh is the
same whether it is the result of cooling or running a conveyance system.  As
we are all aware there certainly are energy saving opportunities for these
loads.
 
It is possible to document savings for these loads however these are
currently considered on a case-by-case basis.  We hope to develop baselines
for many of these process loads where possible so we can encourage both
designers and owners to address all energy usage.

Marcus,
 
I think a reasonable solution would be to include the heat loads from
machinery in the simulation but not the energy required to operate the
process load.  This can be accomplished by putting the process loads on a
separate "meter" in the simulation.  The energy required to operate the
process load is ignored by the other building meters for cooling and
lighting, but the heat addition for the process loads are accounted for.
 
In this way,  the LEED certification is for the building not the process.
 
Many of he process measures for machine shops: compressed air controls,
fixing air leaks process, interlocking ventilation with welding or painting
operations, HVLP paint spray guns etc.  are not defined by the building
designer.

Under LEED v2.2 you must include all of the process loads and equipment.
 
The post-processing you describe was used under LEED v2.1 and is not allowed
under v2.2.
 
You are correct that the opportunity for savings will be less in this type
of facility as a result.  The USGBC has recognized that this is an issue and
is working on ways to address it.
 
Any thoughts are welcome.

We are working on a LEED NC 2.2 project to predict
energy savings with eQuest for a 200,000 sf machinery
workshop facility. 
 
One question we have is whether to include the process
loads in the workshop. We feel that it makes the most
sense to include the heat generated from the process
equipment as internal cooling load and treated by HVAC
systems. However, the electrical power specifically to
process equipment should not be included. For such a
machinery facility, the electrical power to process
equipment constitutes 50% of total electricity
consumption, and can significantly reduce the total
energy saving prediction by 10%. Has anyone has
experiences with such a industrial facility? Thanks

Update on User Interfaces?

DOE plans to release an EnergyPlus plugin for Google's Sketchup later this
spring. The EnergyPlus plugin will integrate building simulation
functionality into the SketchUp drawing environment. The plugin stores
EnergyPlus input data on SketchUp surfaces as they are drawn by the user.
EnergyPlus toolbar buttons allow zones and surfaces to be created with only
a few mouse clicks. Construction assignments are 'painted' onto surfaces
using a palette of EnergyPlus constructions. Users will be able to execute
an annual simulation from within SketchUp. Watch the EnergyPlus web site
and email for more information.

EP-Quick creates an EnergyPlus input file based on a broad range of zone
templates (released in April 2005). E2AC is an interface in Portuguese and
English (available since January 2005). DesignBuilder, a graphic user
interface, was released in December 2005. Hevacomp uses EnergyPlus as its
simulation engine (2006). EFEN is now available in beta version for users
to test. Green Building Studio can take an existing CAD file and convert to
an EnergyPlus input file. Several other interfaces are under development.
Watch our web site (http://www.energyplus.gov/ep_interfaces.html) for
up-to-date information on these and other interfaces.

A number of utilities and tools for creating, editing, and running input
files come with EnergyPlus, including IDF Editor, EP-Launch, and
HVAC-Diagram (see http://www.energyplus.gov/ep_utilities.html). Third party
tools for creating, editing, and displaying EnergyPlus input files are also
available, including DrawBDL, EcoTect,  ESP-r, Green Building Studio,
EzDrawPlus, IFCtoIDF, TSe+, and EzPlus-Parm. See
http://www.energyplus.gov/third_party_tools.html for more information.

Greetings fellow BLDG-SIMmers,
 
Just a note to add. We have a similar LEED v2.2 project for a food processing facility where there is a LARGE refrigeration load. If we were to include the total refrigeration load in both the denominator and numerator of the DEC/ECB calculation (for percent energy cost savings), it would badly dilute the percent savings.
 
In our LEED template submission to USGBC we opted to exclude this "industrial load," citing Section 2.3(c) from ASHRAE 90.1-2004, which allows for an industrial process classification as follows:
 
"The provisions of this standard [ASHRAE 90.1-2004] do not apply to:
(a) single family structures...
(b) buildings that do not use either electricity or fossil fuel...
(c) equipment and portions of building systems that use energy primarily to provide for industrial, manufacturing, or commercial process.
 
In other words, we've made a deliberate distinction between industrial process loads and non-industrial/commercial building process loads such as lighting, plug-loads, and office equipment. We've included the non-industrial/commercial building process loads but not the industrial process loads in the DEC/ECB calculation.
 
No word back yet from USGBC on this approach, so we can't guarantee that our interpretation is acceptable, but that's how we did it.

Marcus,
 
I think a reasonable solution would be to include the heat loads from
machinery in the simulation but not the energy required to operate the
process load.  This can be accomplished by putting the process loads on
a separate "meter" in the simulation.  The energy required to operate
the process load is ignored by the other building meters for cooling and
lighting, but the heat addition for the process loads are accounted for.
 
In this way,  the LEED certification is for the building not the
process.
 
Many of he process measures for machine shops: compressed air controls,
fixing air leaks process, interlocking ventilation with welding or
painting operations, HVLP paint spray guns etc.  are not defined by the
building designer.   
 
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Jon McHugh, PE

Hi David,
 
Charlie may have uncovered a problem with how SHGC is optimized for
developing the ASHRAE 90.1  prescriptive tables.  I would anticipate
that the deeper the perimeter zones, the less valuable solar heating is
in Northern zones. As a thought experiment, consider a single zone per
floor versus a 5 zone model per floor with very narrow perimeter zones.
 
How deep are the perimeter zones in the ASHRAE prototypical models?
 
If the ASHRAE prescriptive requirements have not optimized energy costs
for representative building zoning, the problem statement that results
from this is not whether people can comply with the standard or beat the
standard as part of a LEED analysis, but whether the ASHRAE  standard is
sufficiently stringent in northern climates. 
 
If one can increase SHGC in a ECB analysis and show this decreases
energy costs relative to the prescriptive building, this allows one to
decrease efficiency in other building components and still comply with
ASHRAE 90.1.
 
Thus whether the building complies prescriptively or via ECB, it is
desirable from an energy efficiency perspective that the prescriptive
tables are optimized for minimizing life cycle cost for the
representative prototypes.
 

Jon McHugh, PE

Remember that those total annual energy quantities include
heating/cooling for the outside air which may be different than envelope
heating loads, and that the energy costs are not the same per BTU.  (Not
sure where the EIA totals come from - DHW may also be included?)
 
That said, a typical "square" design would have perimeter zones that
would/wouldn't need heating even while the core of the building required
cooling.  That effect would be captured by an ECB analysis or Appendix G
analysis with the baseline building being "penalized' for using the
standard's glazing.  The trade-offs between additional cooling and
beneficial solar heating could be quantified then, including the costs.
 
Obviously, a building that might benefit from reduced glazing
requirements will now have to do a simulation to document that fact in
the code or LEED process.  They could probably commission a much
simplified model to determine what level of glazing works best and then
either build a prescriptive building or pursue ECB as necessary.
 
A LEED building would normally have much of this modeling work included
in their scope anyway for EAC1, so an additional modeling exercise to
determine the optimal glazing wouldn't be a big deal.
 
I only see this as a major problem for buildings in the northerly
climates that wanted to use 90.1 prescriptively, and that weren't going
to run an energy model already.  I don't have a feel for how many
buildings would fall into that category.

	Charlie,
	 
	(this maybe off topic) 
	 
	Good point, however, you must remember, that the development of
the prescriptive tables in 90.1 is based on a generic office building
with an floor plan aspect ratio of 1:1.  it is an internally load
dominated building, so even up to climate zone 7 (maybe not 8) in
calculating ANNUAL energy consumption, reducing solar heat gain (while
allowing some light in for assumed daylighting) was the key factor in
the glazing selection that comes out of the model.  Again, it was annual
energy consumption.  
	 
	Prescriptive codes are blunt instruments of change.   I think we
all agree that if you change the building aspect ratio, choose good
glass/shading and install a daylight harvesting/dimming system, design
the interior to take advantage of all of this, you are 70% of the way to
a kick ass energy efficient design.

	International Glazing Database (IGDB), which is part of WINDOW
5.2 program (windows.lbl.gov) contains several hundred individual glass
layers whose solar transmittance is at or below 0.3, which, as a part of
glazing system and whole fenestration product, would produce SHGC of
0.25 or lower, which meets ASHRAE 90.1 for all climate zones.  The best
choice for low SHGC windows is so called spectrally selective low-e, and
there are at least 100 glass products with this type of low-e coating.
The cost of these products is only marginally higher than the cost of
clear glass.
	 
	I think that you are definitely overlooking something.
	 
	Having said that, I do want to state that the use of low SHGC
products in heating dominated climates (anything at or above climate
zone 5) is wrong and is the major flaw of both ASHRAE 90.1 and IECC
2006, particularly for orientations with potentially high solar gain in
the winter, such as South orientation.

Sangeetha,
I found the book entitled Computerized Building Energy Simulation
Handbook by James P. Waltz very useful to analyse simulation results. You
may get an overview of the book's contants using google book search
http://books.google.com/ .
I hope this helps.
Regards,
Ashfaque

I am looking for a paper on the differences and changes from ASHRAE 90.1
: 2001 to the new 2004 version.

 

I've checked the ASHRAE.org site and am having no luck.

 

Chapter 1 in the 2004 User's manual touches on a few changes, but is
pretty vague.

 

Does anyone know of any such papers?

 

Thanks,

Scott

Sustainable Building Analyst

Elements, the sustainable design consulting division of BNIM Architects,
is currently seeking an experienced Sustainable Building Analyst with a
focus on energy and daylight analysis for a wide variety of  new
construction and renovation projects across the United States.

Elements is a highly specialized division of BNIM Architects, one of the
leaders in the sustainable design movement. Our goal is to push the
boundaries of sustainable thinking and design on projects and to help
create innovative solutions on a variety of project types. 

Elements is dedicated to helping design firms, corporations, state,
county and municipal governments and non-profits balance environmental
and economic concerns by the transformation and increased efficiency of
buildings, developments and communities.

The Analyst will work with both BNIM design teams and Elements
consulting clientele to actively inform the project design and integrate
efficiency measures into the design by evaluating building and system
design strategies.  The emphasis will be on using building and daylight
simulation tools to help inform design, as well as document performance
compared to applicable standards.  While the primary focus is on energy
and water performance based on building and climate type specific energy
and water efficiency measures, other responsibilities include directed
research and evaluation and analysis of green building products.  The
Analyst will also have opportunities to educate the community, the
industry and clients on new technologies and innovative solutions via
abstracts, publications and conference presentations.

At a minimum the candidate should be USGBC LEED accredited and have an

the USGBC's LEED-NC program, including preparation of technical reports,
presentations and project team communications are preferred.  The
candidate must have strong knowledge of Visual DOE, Equest or EnergyPlus
as well as a Radiance based daylight simulation tool. Experience with
IES Virtual Environment, CFD modeling and knowledge of renewable energy
systems would be beneficial. The candidate should have excellent
abilities with MS Excel and PowerPoint with excellent graphic skills as
a plus.  Creative thinking with effective written and oral communication
and teamwork skills are required. Candidate is expected to assist and
sometimes lead the preparation of information regarding the design,
specifications, materials, equipment, estimated life cycle costs and
creation of sustainable matrices.  Additionally candidates will have
opportunities assist with the design and sometimes lead the presentation
of sustainability workshops to professionals in the fields of
architecture, engineering, real-estate and construction.

This position will require working closely with other staff members,
associated consultants, and members of multiple client project teams.
We are looking for the candidate who is well organized, a good time
manager, adaptable, enjoys travel and flexible to changes in deadlines
and work focus.  Travel may be required

Remember that those total annual energy quantities include
heating/cooling for the outside air which may be different than envelope
heating loads, and that the energy costs are not the same per BTU.  (Not
sure where the EIA totals come from - DHW may also be included?)

 

That said, a typical "square" design would have perimeter zones that
would/wouldn't need heating even while the core of the building required
cooling.  That effect would be captured by an ECB analysis or Appendix G
analysis with the baseline building being "penalized' for using the
standard's glazing.  The trade-offs between additional cooling and
beneficial solar heating could be quantified then, including the costs.

 

Obviously, a building that might benefit from reduced glazing
requirements will now have to do a simulation to document that fact in
the code or LEED process.  They could probably commission a much
simplified model to determine what level of glazing works best and then
either build a prescriptive building or pursue ECB as necessary.

 

A LEED building would normally have much of this modeling work included
in their scope anyway for EAC1, so an additional modeling exercise to
determine the optimal glazing wouldn't be a big deal.

 

I only see this as a major problem for buildings in the northerly
climates that wanted to use 90.1 prescriptively, and that weren't going
to run an energy model already.  I don't have a feel for how many
buildings would fall into that category.

	Charlie,

	 

	(this maybe off topic) 

	 

	Good point, however, you must remember, that the development of
the prescriptive tables in 90.1 is based on a generic office building
with an floor plan aspect ratio of 1:1.  it is an internally load
dominated building, so even up to climate zone 7 (maybe not 8) in
calculating ANNUAL energy consumption, reducing solar heat gain (while
allowing some light in for assumed daylighting) was the key factor in
the glazing selection that comes out of the model.  Again, it was annual
energy consumption.  

	 

	Prescriptive codes are blunt instruments of change.   I think we
all agree that if you change the building aspect ratio, choose good
glass/shading and install a daylight harvesting/dimming system, design
the interior to take advantage of all of this, you are 70% of the way to
a kick ass energy efficient design.

	International Glazing Database (IGDB), which is part of WINDOW
5.2 program (windows.lbl.gov) contains several hundred individual glass
layers whose solar transmittance is at or below 0.3, which, as a part of
glazing system and whole fenestration product, would produce SHGC of
0.25 or lower, which meets ASHRAE 90.1 for all climate zones.  The best
choice for low SHGC windows is so called spectrally selective low-e, and
there are at least 100 glass products with this type of low-e coating.
The cost of these products is only marginally higher than the cost of
clear glass.

	 

	I think that you are definitely overlooking something.

	 

	Having said that, I do want to state that the use of low SHGC
products in heating dominated climates (anything at or above climate
zone 5) is wrong and is the major flaw of both ASHRAE 90.1 and IECC
2006, particularly for orientations with potentially high solar gain in
the winter, such as South orientation.

FYI. 

We have found with DOE-21e, when modeling a crawlspace,  that one must have some portion of crawlspace wall above grade, or else DOE-2 will not calc infltration as it assumes the below-grade wall is surrounded by the ground. 

Also, one should use Winkleman-Huang ground coupling model, and use CWFs, layered walls, floors, etc. Otherwise, be prepared for some odd results. Its a good idea to look at the crawlspace "zone" temp to see that it stays reasonable.

If it is a sealed crawl space, you can simulate it as a separate zone,
but if it is not, then, you might need to look at the ventilation rate
in the crawl space; for example, if the entire crawlspace floor is
covered, then you can reduce the number of openings, if not then you
have to provide the minimum amount of opining on the crawlspace as
specified by code. Second; did you insulate the crawlspace walls or the
floor of the first floor?

	Subject: [BLDG-SIM] ASHRAE 90.1 - window SHGC
	
	
	International Glazing Database (IGDB), which is part of WINDOW
5.2 program (windows.lbl.gov) contains several hundred individual glass
layers whose solar transmittance is at or below 0.3, which, as a part of
glazing system and whole fenestration product, would produce SHGC of
0.25 or lower, which meets ASHRAE 90.1 for all climate zones.  The best
choice for low SHGC windows is so called spectrally selective low-e, and
there are at least 100 glass products with this type of low-e coating.
The cost of these products is only marginally higher than the cost of
clear glass.
	 
	I think that you are definitely overlooking something.
	 
	Having said that, I do want to state that the use of low SHGC
products in heating dominated climates (anything at or above climate
zone 5) is wrong and is the major flaw of both ASHRAE 90.1 and IECC
2006, particularly for orientations with potentially high solar gain in
the winter, such as South orientation.

In-Reply-To: <MDAEMON-F200704091720.AA2015390pd80002857908@gard.com>
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200704101141.AA4149906pd80001401766@gard.com>

I'm modeling a building with some walls that are earth bermed with 2 to 3
feet of soil.  The walls are concrete and insulated on the outside.  So the
layers would be, outside to inside: soil, 2" rigid insulation, 8" concrete
wall, 3" interior block.  

EQuest keeps telling me that it cannot simulate this wall because it is too
thick or too dense.  Equest is recognizing this as an underground wall (at
first I thought I had this wall designated as an above grade wall but it's
not.)  

I re-arranged the layers and if the insulation is on the inside and the
concrete is only 6" thick it works.  But then I don't have the mass on the
heated side of the space (which is how the building is constructed.)  

So I'm not sure what the problem is.  Anybody have any ideas?  

Thanks very much!

Can anyone speak to the advantages of using eQuest as

limitations of eQuest to model windows and zones as
easily as with TRACE.

I meant to say DOE2 file (not EnergyPlus, although the gap info is also in
the E+ file) that WINDOW 5.2 generates:

The glazing system gap data is in the EnergyPlus file that WINDOW 5.2
generates (it is a text file so you can look at it with a text editor), so
presumably the problem happens when this WINDOW 5.2 file is used in Equest.

Even better, you can block out these cells if the glass type refers to the
library. The reason for my question is because the Shading Coefficient cell
is blocked out if we select the library, while these other cells (including
the glass conductance) is not blocked. The logical conclusion is that EQuest
will look at the library if it needs SC, but still need the values of the
GLASS-CONDUCTANCE, VIS-TRANS and OUTSIDE-EMISS. I would suggest to block
these cells if the library is selected.

On importing from Windows5:

The reason I ask this question is when I imported glass properties from
Windows5, I found that the windows conduction jumps compared to my baseline
scenario.

The glass conductance value was the immediate suspect, but it turned out
that this is not the problem.

The problem for my case was that every time I imported the window, the gap
between the panes was set to zero. The import filter can pick up the gas
fill between the pane, but it failed to import the gap distance. No warning
was issued so I initially accepted that the import is fine. Only after
digging into the imported properties one by one, then I found that the gaps
are set to zero.

Solution/Work around: Save the EQuest file after import. close EQuest and
open the input file (.inp) in the text editor. Find the imported glazing in
the glass section, type in 12mm (or whatever the gap is), and that's it.

The next time you import from Window5, and wonder why the window conduction
jump, check the gap between the panes.

I suspect this is a bug in the EQuest filter from Window5. I have only
tested it with a few different windows configuration, and the behaviour
seems consistent.

Vikram,
 
Perhaps you are using older version of IGDB in WINDOW 5.2.  The PPG's
Solarban 70XL is available in IGDB from ID 5431 to 5434 in thicknesses from
2 to 5 mm.  To update IGDB in WINDOW 5, go to windows.lbl.gov web site,
navigate to WINDOW program pages and see instructions how to update IGDB.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think your design building can vary from the
90.1 prescriptions (at least for the ECB which is what I am assuming your
using it for - give the design case reference). For example if you use
daylight sensors and you want to use a lighter glass to take advantage of
it, I think you can as long as there's an overall energy savings - am I
correct?
 
Speaking of high performance glass - I am trying to model PPG's Solarban 70,
and it doesn't seem to be available in the window 5.2 database. (Its a new
product with a 0.63 Tviz & 0.27 SHGC - a light to solar gain ratio of 2.33).
Is it possible to manipulate the numbers in Window 5.2? Is the simplified
glazing option acceptable for 90.1 ECB analyses?

When modeling my design case, I find that most windows cannot achieve the

Why would ASHRAE set unattainable minimum values?      

 

Am I overlooking something in ASHRAE 90.1???

Len,
 
I knew that I would touch sensitive subject.  Actually, we ran number of
different simulations using both DOE2 and EnergyPlus and in vast majority of
cases for commercial buildings low SHGC products use more energy in climate
zones 5 and above than comparable high solar gain products.  One of the
reasons that this may not have been the case when ASHRAE 90.1 ran scalar
studies, is that it used overly simplified methodology, embedded in a
spreadsheet, which assumes constant SHGC and U-factor.  We have shown (and
some others, like Jeff Haberl from ESL) that this oversimplification causes
errors upwards of 30%!   I have been pointing this to the 90.1 envelope
subcommittee for quite some time now, but it pretty much fell on deaf ears
and was ignored.
 
The contention that commercial buildings are internal load dominated and
that the heating load is not a factor, is a myth, which is easily verified
by looking at the DOE energy information agency data, where it is evident
that commercial buildings in United States use more energy for heating than
for cooling on a national level, which includes all climate zones, such as
1, 2, etc.  If the building stock uses more energy for heating than for
cooling when cooling climate zones are accounted for, it is easy to deduce
that they are using much more energy for heating than for cooling for
climate zones 5 and above.  If the argument is to reduce peak cooling load,
then there is some merit in using low solar gain products in the North, but
we should be very clear on this.
 
We have developed a new tool EFEN, which calculates energy use of commercial
buildings using EnergyPlus simulation engine, and we have interface to
WINDOW5 program, so this is all easily verified.  The program is currently
in Beta testing, so feel free to check it out at:
www.designbuildersoftware.com/efen.php.   The program provides parametric
analysis, so you can easily compare different options.
 
Regards,
Charlie

Charlie,
 
(this maybe off topic) 
 
Good point, however, you must remember, that the development of the
prescriptive tables in 90.1 is based on a generic office building with an
floor plan aspect ratio of 1:1.  it is an internally load dominated
building, so even up to climate zone 7 (maybe not 8) in calculating ANNUAL
energy consumption, reducing solar heat gain (while allowing some light in
for assumed daylighting) was the key factor in the glazing selection that
comes out of the model.  Again, it was annual energy consumption.  
 
Prescriptive codes are blunt instruments of change.   I think we all agree
that if you change the building aspect ratio, choose good glass/shading and
install a daylight harvesting/dimming system, design the interior to take
advantage of all of this, you are 70% of the way to a kick ass energy
efficient design.

Vikram,
 
Perhaps you are using older version of IGDB in WINDOW 5.2.  The PPG's
Solarban 70XL is available in IGDB from ID 5431 to 5434 in thicknesses from
2 to 5 mm.  To update IGDB in WINDOW 5, go to windows.lbl.gov web site,
navigate to WINDOW program pages and see instructions how to update IGDB.
 
Regards,
Charlie

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think your design building can vary from the
90.1 prescriptions (at least for the ECB which is what I am assuming your
using it for - give the design case reference). For example if you use
daylight sensors and you want to use a lighter glass to take advantage of
it, I think you can as long as there's an overall energy savings - am I
correct?
 
Speaking of high performance glass - I am trying to model PPG's Solarban 70,
and it doesn't seem to be available in the window 5.2 database. (Its a new
product with a 0.63 Tviz & 0.27 SHGC - a light to solar gain ratio of 2.33).
Is it possible to manipulate the numbers in Window 5.2? Is the simplified
glazing option acceptable for 90.1 ECB analyses?

International Glazing Database (IGDB), which is part of WINDOW 5.2 program
(windows.lbl.gov) contains several hundred individual glass layers whose
solar transmittance is at or below 0.3, which, as a part of glazing system
and whole fenestration product, would produce SHGC of 0.25 or lower, which
meets ASHRAE 90.1 for all climate zones.  The best choice for low SHGC
windows is so called spectrally selective low-e, and there are at least 100
glass products with this type of low-e coating.  The cost of these products
is only marginally higher than the cost of clear glass.
 
I think that you are definitely overlooking something.
 
Having said that, I do want to state that the use of low SHGC products in
heating dominated climates (anything at or above climate zone 5) is wrong
and is the major flaw of both ASHRAE 90.1 and IECC 2006, particularly for
orientations with potentially high solar gain in the winter, such as South

When modeling my design case, I find that most windows cannot achieve the

Why would ASHRAE set unattainable minimum values?      

 

Am I overlooking something in ASHRAE 90.1???

All - 

 

Does anyone have any insights into modeling a night-time flush in a
radiant heating system with exhaust fans only? My system type is a
water-loop heat pump. I have tried changing the cooling and night fan
schedules, but this has been ineffective (due to the system type, I
believe). At the moment I have set the infiltration rate higher during
the night, but this is simultaneously increasing my heating load.

 

Thanks,

Charlie,
 
(this maybe off topic) 
 
Good point, however, you must remember, that the development of the
prescriptive tables in 90.1 is based on a generic office building with
an floor plan aspect ratio of 1:1.  it is an internally load dominated
building, so even up to climate zone 7 (maybe not 8) in calculating
ANNUAL energy consumption, reducing solar heat gain (while allowing some
light in for assumed daylighting) was the key factor in the glazing
selection that comes out of the model.  Again, it was annual energy
consumption.  
 
Prescriptive codes are blunt instruments of change.   I think we all
agree that if you change the building aspect ratio, choose good
glass/shading and install a daylight harvesting/dimming system, design
the interior to take advantage of all of this, you are 70% of the way to
a kick ass energy efficient design.

If it is a sealed crawl space, you can simulate it as a separate zone,
but if it is not, then, you might need to look at the ventilation rate
in the crawl space; for example, if the entire crawlspace floor is
covered, then you can reduce the number of openings, if not then you
have to provide the minimum amount of opining on the crawlspace as
specified by code. Second; did you insulate the crawlspace walls or the
floor of the first floor?

Vikram and Marlin: Thanks for your reply

Even better, you can block out these cells if the glass type
refers to the library. The reason for my question is because the
Shading Coefficient cell is blocked out if we select the library,
while these other cells (including the glass conductance) is not
blocked. The logical conclusion is that EQuest will look at the
library if it needs SC, but still need the values of the
GLASS-CONDUCTANCE, VIS-TRANS and OUTSIDE-EMISS. I would suggest
to block these cells if the library is selected.

On importing from Windows5:

The reason I ask this question is when I imported glass
properties from Windows5, I found that the windows conduction
jumps compared to my baseline scenario.

The glass conductance value was the immediate suspect, but it
turned out that this is not the problem.

The problem for my case was that every time I imported the
window, the gap between the panes was set to zero. The import
filter can pick up the gas fill between the pane, but it failed
to import the gap distance. No warning was issued so I initially
accepted that the import is fine. Only after digging into the
imported properties one by one, then I found that the gaps are
set to zero.

Solution/Work around: Save the EQuest file after import. close
EQuest and open the input file (.inp) in the text editor. Find
the imported glazing in the glass section, type in 12mm (or
whatever the gap is), and that's it.

The next time you import from Window5, and wonder why the window
conduction jump, check the gap between the panes.

I suspect this is a bug in the EQuest filter from Window5. I have
only tested it with a few different windows configuration, and
the behaviour seems consistent.

Regards,

Ery

Madam:

If I am not correct, a PSZ system is EITHER cooling or
heating, but not both, and a SZRH has a MAINTAINED
cooling coil at all times of operation, with
temperature controlled by reheat.

Check your cooling coil operating hours for both. I
will bet there are many more hours (and many
simultaneous heating and cooling hours) in the SZRH
than in the PSZ.

I modeled a building with DX cooling by first using PSZ and then by using a 
district chilled water system with SZRH.  However, the cooling MBTU in the 
BEPS report for SZRH is much higher than in the BEPS report for PSZ (about 
2.5 times higher).  Do you know why?  I thought they should come out close 
in MBTU.

Thank you very much in advance for your help.

Ery,
I'm pretty sure eQUEST takes the layers into account when it does this.
I think the 1.47 is the U-value for a standard pane of glass, which
doesn't really change all that much between window assemblies. What
changes is the effective COG U-Value for the whole assembly depending on
the gas used in the air gap, the layers and the coating (also the tilt -
a horizontal IGU has a much higher U-value than a vertical one.

A simple way to test whether the layers are being taken into account is
to try glass assemblies with different U-values but similar optical
properties and see what difference it makes.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] EQuest question: glass conductance

All,

I want to know how EQuest calculates the conduction through the
multi-pane window that is defined through the glass library,
specifically which value is actually used as the conductance.

In the component tree "Glass Type" (spreadsheet view), we have the
"Glass Conductance" value specified (1.47 is the default value,
regardless how many panes the window have). This value exists even if
the glass specification is read from the library. If we click on the
detailed properties of the glass, the library will be read and we can
see the conductance of every layer the window has.

My question is, which value is used when EQuest calculates the
conduction from the window? Is it the "Glass Conductance" value (which
is 1.47 by default) or from the value from the library (which will be
different depending on how many layers the window has)?

I noticed that when I imported a new glazing from Window5, the new
window type will be given the default "Glass conductance" value of 1.47.
I do not change this value because I assume EQuest will take the
conductance values of every layer from the library. Should I change this
manually? (If yes, this will reduce the benefit of having a
library)

Another question:
If we right click on the Glass Conductance cell, and view the default
value, there is a status bar message which says "amount of heat that
glass conducts (includes outside air film but not inside air film)".
If we choose the DOE2 help, however, Glass Conductance is "The
conductance of the glazing, excluding the outside air film coefficient."

So which one is used by EQuest: including or excluding?

Regards,

Ery

Hello,

I just wanted to make a correction to my last posting.  It turns out the
Frankfurt weather file on the EERE website does not have errors on it.
Sorry for the confusion, and thanks for everyone's help!

Chris,

 

I think the curve in DOE2 is actually the EIR as a function of PLR times
the PLR.  Hence, the term MPLR (modified part load ratio) is sometimes
used to differentiate.

 

The default RESYS linear curve (0.125, 0.875) is not theoretically valid
at low PLR because the actual EIR is increased too much and the EER
tends toward zero.  The actual product of EIR and PLR must tend toward
zero as PLR tends to zero, and the EER multiplier should not go below
about 0.75 due to realistic minimum run times per cycle (4 to 6 minutes
for most residential systems, maybe longer for commercial).  You may be
better off at low PLR values if you simply assume modified EIR-PLR is
equal to the PLR, as depicted by the linear curve (0,1), suggesting to
DOE2 that EER is not a function of PLR at all.

 

If you are interested, I have developed an empirical cubic function (0,
0.83, 0.358, -0.188) that represents this relationship for a typical
RESYS application, but am not satisfied with it yet.

It looks like my table is all messed when I arrives.  Hopefully you can
make sense of it.

I am comparing the default
DOE2.1e HP heating curves to the
performance data from various manufacturers.  In particular the
EIR-FPLR curve does not fit what the manufacturers show in their
data.  The default curve shows the EIR dropping as the part load
ratio drops.  My assumption is that PLR = Operating Capacity/Design
Capacity.  With the Trane, McQuay, and Waterfurnace data, the EIR
increases as the PLR goes down.  I am assuming that part load is a
result of lower flow through the unit or from higher entering dry bulb
temperature.  So when I do create my set of heating curves
HEAT-EIR-FT, HEAT-CAP-FT and HEAT-EIR-FPLR, the performance is
significantly worse than with the default DOE2.1e curves.

Chris:
 
In your message and data, It seems there are some misunderstandings about the EIR-FPLR used in the DOE-2 program. For heat pump application, which adjusts heating/cooling output by turning on and off the compressor, the value of EIR-FPLR is the actual heat pump run time during a hour. The definition of PLR is the ratio of heating/cooling demand to the heating/cooling capacity of the heat pump during a particular hour. In other word, PLR is the ideal heat pump run time without considering any cycling loss. Therefore, when PLR drops, the value of EIR-FPLR will also drop. Due to the cycling loss, the value of EIR-FPLR is usually larger than the PLR, which means the heat pump has to run a little longer to offset the cycling loss when providing required heating/cooling. The cycling loss of the heat pump can be determined from its Cycling Degradation factor (Cd), which is usually available from heat pump manufacturers.
 
BTW, If the fan power has been accounted for in the COP and the indoor fan of the heat pump will run continuously, you'd better subtract the effect of fan power when you converting COP to EIR. Otherwise, you may overestimate the fan energy consumption if you also specify a non-zero fan power in the simulation since you count the fan power twice by doing so.
 
Hope it helps,
 
Xiaobing

I am comparing the default DOE2.1e HP heating curves to the

performance data from various manufacturers.  In particular the

EIR-FPLR curve does not fit what the manufacturers show in their

data.  The default curve shows the EIR dropping as the part load

ratio drops.  My assumption is that PLR = Operating Capacity/Design

Capacity.  With the Trane, McQuay, and Waterfurnace data, the EIR

increases as the PLR goes down.  I am assuming that part load is a

result of lower flow through the unit or from higher entering dry bulb

temperature.  So when I do create my set of heating curves

HEAT-EIR-FT, HEAT-CAP-FT and HEAT-EIR-FPLR, the performance is

significantly worse than with the default DOE2.1e curves.  



Am I misinterpreting how to plot the data points for the HEAT-EIR-FPLR

curve?  Example from Trane:

It looks like my table is all messed when I arrives.  Hopefully you 
can make sense of it.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] DOE2.1e HP HEAT-EIR-FPLR Problems
In-Reply-To: <MDAEMON-F200704040630.AA3003140pd80002833504@gard.com>
References: <MDAEMON-F200704040630.AA3003140pd80002833504@gard.com>

I am comparing the default DOE2.1e HP heating curves to the 
performance data from various manufacturers.  In particular the 
EIR-FPLR curve does not fit what the manufacturers show in their 
data.  The default curve shows the EIR dropping as the part load 
ratio drops.  My assumption is that PLR = Operating Capacity/Design 
Capacity.  With the Trane, McQuay, and Waterfurnace data, the EIR 
increases as the PLR goes down.  I am assuming that part load is a 
result of lower flow through the unit or from higher entering dry 
bulb temperature.  So when I do create my set of heating curves 
HEAT-EIR-FT, HEAT-CAP-FT and HEAT-EIR-FPLR, the performance is 
significantly worse than with the default DOE2.1e curves.

Am I misinterpreting how to plot the data points for the 
HEAT-EIR-FPLR curve?  Example from Trane:

Dear colleagues:

Is there any way to simulate a Dedicated Outdoor Air System (DOAS) supplying pre-treated ventilation air to fan-coil units?
I remind I tried to use the "Outside Air from System option" (OA-FROM-SYSTEM keyword in DOE2) but it didn't work.

Any comment or experience regarding this subject would be appreciated.

Thanks.

Anurag,

You may find my post on creating eQuest multilevel spaces (atriums)
helpful...

http://elcca-exchange.blogspot.com/2007/03/equest-multi-level-spaces.htm
l 

There seems to be an unresolved question on whether eQuest can simulate
the benefit from daylighting for interior zones adjacent to atriums.  If
the benefits from daylighting is part of your analysis, a couple of
suggestions:  

* Assure interior spaces adjacent to atriums are designated as
"sunspaces"  
* Use the 3.61 version of eQuest, which has enhanced support for
skylights, light wells etc.

Hope that helps...but if you're still having trouble with atriums,
e-mail me directly.

Dear friends,

I am a research scholar doing my research on Green building Index of
hospitailty buildings through life cycle assessment of Embodied and
operational energy of eveloved design patterns of the hotel block. (
Department of Architecture, School of Planning and Architecture, New
Delhi India)

I have evolved 7 simple Design patterns, each identical in floor area,
number of floors and material specifications.
I have been able to simulate 5 patterns in equest, but am unable to
create file for balance two patterns. A) Pattern with an atrium and
rooms facing towards the atrium. B) Pattern with an Atrium and rooms
facing outwards. These are also very simple blocks, but I am unable to
do the zoning for the Atrium.

Can anyone has time to help me create file in equest  for these two
patterns, so that I am able to simulate for operational energy of these
two patterns for different climatic zones and orientations.

I shall be grateful to anyone one who can help me create these two files
in equest.
This will help me a great deal in finalising my ph.d research work.

Thanks and regards

Anurag Roy

Hi All,

Can anyone give me some information /references on the recommended building air conditioning indoor set point temperature for office buildings in Tropical countries (example Thailand)?

Many thanks

  Marcus,

  I think that this approach to documenting natural ventilation within the bounds of Appendix G is the correct one. 

  However, there are a couple things I'd like to note for future consideration:

  1. If the proposed building can stay within the unmet load hours limits without a fictitious mechanical cooling system, that should be acceptable, provided that budget and proposed models have identical thermostat setpoints, etc. 

  2. As the USGBC considers project carbon savings and benchmarking of buildings versus target finder, I would encourage a broader view on natural ventilation and other strategies and the modeling process. In my opinion, for this type of comparison the building should be modeled exactly as it is to be built and operated - i.e. don't include fictitious mechanical systems that are not installed or other such deviations from the as-built condition. We already run this type of model for owners so they can see what they are really going to expect for energy savings and indoor conditions and I suspect that others do the same.

  Thanks for the good news.

  Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Natural Ventilation in LEED[Filed 30 Mar 2007 09:36]


  FYI a new CIR has been posted on the USGBC web site regarding natural ventilation systems and LEED projects.  The text is below.  Please consider this just a starting point and general guidance for projects that are similar to the one described.  We welcome feedback.



        3/22/2007 -  
       Credit Interpretation Request
        Our project consists of two small buildings close to the ocean that will achieve substantial energy savings by incorporating a natural ventilation strategy. No mechanical heating or cooling is intended for either building, with the exception of a small electrical/server room. 

        The building is designed with a very narrow and long floor plate situated perpendicular to prevailing winds in the area. Ventilation openings are consistent with the requirements of ASHRAE 62.1-2004 Section 6.8. The project also meets the requirements outlined in the CIBSE Applications Manual 10: 2005 as referenced in EQc2 for Natural ventilation in non-domestic buildings. Per Title-24 2005 requirements for natural ventilation, the sum of operable windows will be greater than 5% of the floor area of each space that is naturally ventilated. The openings will also be readily accessible to the occupants of each space at all times. Outdoor airflow through the openings in regularly occupied spaces will come directly from the outdoors, not through intermediate spaces such as other occupied spaces or corridors. Openings include operable windows, through-the roof ventilators, and vents between interior spaces. Control mechanisms for the natural ventilation openings are manual. A long, tall hallway situated perpendicular to the prevailing winds will collect heated air and exhaust it the outside. The roof over much of the space is sloped allowing air to enter on the low side and exit on the high side. In all cases, the building is designed to facilitate cross-ventilation with windows low on the walls for drawing the air in, and windows and vents high in opposite walls or on the roof to draw air out. Under ASHRAE 55 definitions, the building spaces are defined as "naturally conditioned spaces, occupant controlled" where the thermal conditions of the spaces are regulated primarily by the opening and closing of windows or vents by the occupants. Since the building will have a limited number of occupants most of the time, manual control of the windows and vents has been determined the most appropriate strategy for the building to allow control over individual thermal comfort. As indicated by ASHRAE 55-2004, section 5.3, the occupants of the space will be engaged in near sedentary activities with metabolic rates ranging from 1.0 met to 1.3 met. The mean monthly outdoor temperature for the project is greater than 50 deg. F, and less than 92.3 deg. F all months of the year, as required under ASHRAE 55-2004, section 5.3 for naturally ventilated buildings. 

        The User's Manual for ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G states on page G-21: The proposed building default cooling system does not exclude natural ventilation from consideration. It just means that the proposed building is modeled as a hybrid system where cooling is provided by natural ventilation when conditions are acceptable and by the default mechanical cooling system when natural ventilation is inadequate to provide thermal comfort. We are requesting confirmation that the following modeling strategy conforms to the requirements of ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G modeling protocol:

        1. EnergyPlus will be used to model the building since the EnergyPlus software has the capability to evaluate energy and comfort parameters tied to natural ventilation.

        2. The Exceptional Calculation Methodology will be applied to calculate the natural ventilation savings.

        3. The Proposed Design model will be developed to reflect the design parameters for the envelope and lighting. Operable windows will be modeled as fixed, and vents will not be included in the model. Mechanical systems will be modeled identically to the default heating, cooling and fan systems in the Baseline case, except that fans in the proposed case will be modeled as cycling on and off to meet heating and cooling loads during all hours in the proposed case, and will operate continuously during occupied hours in the Baseline Case (per the exception shown in Table G3.1.4).

        4. Using the Exceptional Calculation Methodology, The Proposed Design case will be modified to include natural ventilation for all hours when the cooling and heating loads can be met. Operable windows and vents will be modeled as designed. Cooling and heating setpoint temperatures will be identical to those in the Baseline Case. Schedules will be adjusted to switch on mechanical cooling during hours when natural ventilation alone cannot meet the space temperature setpoints. The final model will meet the ASHRAE G3.1.2.2 requirements stipulating that the Proposed Design cannot exceed the Baseline Design unmet load hours by more than 50, and that unmet load hours for the Proposed Design and Baseline Design cannot exceed 300. 

        5. (Plan B) If the hybrid system cannot be manipulated to meet the unmet load hour requirements within the energy model, hourly output data from a natural ventilation model (having no mechanical cooling) and the Proposed Design model will be combined in a spreadsheet. Each hour where cooling and heating setpoints are met in the natural ventilation model, the hourly results for that model will be used. For all other hours, the hourly results from the Proposed Design Model will be used.

        6. An Exceptional Calculation Methodology narrative provided with the EAc1 submittal will document any schedule adjustments and assumptions that were made to develop the hybrid system. The savings will also be included as a separate line item on the EAc1 submittal.

        Is our proposed energy modeling strategy for natural ventilation acceptable?
       

       
       
        3/22/2007 -  
       Ruling 
        The project is requesting approval for the method of modeling natural ventilation as an energy efficiency measure and for taking credit under EA credit 1. 

        Submittals for natural ventilation savings will be evaluated on a case by case basis. 

        The tools and analysis protocol proposed is acceptable for modeling ventilation savings in this instance. Other analysis tools may also be appropriate.

        To be able to adequately document the process and the results, please be sure to provide in the LEED submittal the following: 

        ? A detailed project description 
        ? Clear identification of the areas that are taking credit for natural ventilation
        ? A detailed description or references that document the modeling algorithms and/or methodology for the natural ventilation portion of the energy model
        ? All thermostat, fan, infiltration and other appropriate schedules for naturally ventilated areas

        Also, the submitted evaluation must demonstrate that the range of unmet load hours is similar for both the proposed and baseline building, to ensure that savings are not claimed for hours outside of the control parameters. In this case, the project has proposed to meet these peak loads with a hypothetical cooling system in the proposed building.

        The project will also need to clearly demonstrate that the operational schedule for the natural ventilation system as modeled aligns with anticipated occupant behavior in terms of scheduled occupancy vs. modeled operation. For example, the model cannot assume that natural ventilation will occur when no one is in the building to operate the system.

        Because manual control is not addressed by the Appendix G modeling methodology, the manual control features of this project must be submitted under the exceptional calculation methodology for case by case review. The project must be prepared to demonstrate convincingly that a manual control strategy is appropriate and workable for this project.

        Please also be sure to take credit for this measure as a separate item on the LEED-NC v2.2 Submittal Template.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200704030336.AA3654328pd80001398141@gard.com>

Hello,

Would anyone be able to provide me with a weather file for Frankfurt,
Germany that I can use in eQUEST?  I believe the one on the EERE website
has errors in it.

Thanks,
Irene

Dear friends,

I am a research scholar doing my research on Green building Index of hospitailty buildings through life cycle assessment of Embodied and operational energy of eveloved design patterns of the hotel block. ( Department of Architecture, School of Planning and Architecture, New Delhi India)

I have evolved 7 simple Design patterns, each identical in floor area, number of floors and material specifications.
I have been able to simulate 5 patterns in equest, but am unable to create file for balance two patterns. A) Pattern with an atrium and rooms facing towards the atrium. B) Pattern with an Atrium and rooms facing outwards. These are also very simple blocks, but I am unable to do the zoning for the Atrium.

Can anyone has time to help me create file in equest  for these two patterns, so that I am able to simulate for operational energy of these two patterns for different climatic zones and orientations.

I shall be grateful to anyone one who can help me create these two files in equest.
This will help me a great deal in finalising my ph.d research work.

Thanks and regards

Anurag Roy

Hello,
Does anyone know how to change which variables are spit out in the  **_EG_MouEU_ED.csv.  In addition to just electric and gas, I'd also like to have steam and chilled water usage from my steam and chilled water meters.  I guess I could create a report, but having the *.csv file update itself after each run is way more convenient.  Any help would be appreciated.
Brett Perron
