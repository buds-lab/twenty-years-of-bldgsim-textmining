Minu,
   I have had occasion to model that type of device using TRNSYS. 
Tracking solar collectors (whether PV or thermal) are easy examples. 
Some years ago, I modelled a device that sits on top of horizontally 
mounted skylight, tracks the sun and tries to bounce more daylight 
down the skylight well. There is nothing stopping you, however, from 
having whatever component of the building (all the way down to the 
walls and roofs) track the sun.
Cheers,
  David

Greetings!

 

I am new on this list and to the concept of building energy simulation
software however I have already learned a bit by reading all of the posts
over the past two weeks. Thanks.

 

My group currently does a fair amount of LEED work and we have decided to
learn more about energy modeling, purchase some software, and possibly
offering modeling service to our clients. I know this will be a long process
to learn the process and software well enough to "sell" these services
however we may as well begin the process now!

 

I have a couple of questions for the group and am looking for some direction
from those of you with much more experience than I have. I am not trying to
start a huge debate here or pitting one software program against another
however your feedback, whatever it may be will be helpful. Therefore my
questions are:

 

1.	Of the "approved" software packages out there [I think 8 different
packages meet the IRS requirements for Tax Deduction], which program
suppliers offer excellent training courses for a person just entering the
field? Do they offer these programs frequently during the year or on an
infrequent basis?

 

2.	As far as ease of use goes I understand that these programs all have
their challenges. Any suggestions on which software program is easiest to
work with? I do not mean the quickest program to get a simulation out of but
a program where it is relatively easy to understand and input data.

 

3.	Are any of these programs more in line with LEED requirements than
others?

 

4.	Ok - the big question: Which program is easiest to use, the most
popular, and why?

 

 

Thanks in advance for any feedback you provide me with. My desire is to
provide quality work for clients on a timely basis without having to spend
large amounts of time overcoming software quirks with one program where
another program may be easier to use.

 

 

Thanks!

Timothy, I respectfully disagree with some of your opinions (and Brandon's)
about how Appendix G unfairly penalizes building designs.  First off calling
it a "penalty" mis-represents what Appendix G is trying to accomplish.  The
goal of Appendix G is  to create a theoretical energy budget for a building
based on the minimum requirements of ASHRAE 90.1.  A methodology for
creating an energy budget has to be the same for every building that uses
it.  This is the reason why Appendix G originally required banded windows
and is the reason it is important to have a building rotation requirement to
represent orientation. 
 
Timothy, you're right, architects often have little control over building
sites and often there is nothing that can be done about how a building gets
sited in an urban environment.  However the building energy budget should be
blind to that fact. The same building (use type, sq.ft., # of floors) in the
same climate zone should have the same energy budget regardless of its
location/orientation.   In some cases building orientation will make it
easier for a building to have a lower EUI and in other cases it will be more
difficult but no matter what the orientation the basis for making a
comparison has to be the same.  Designing and constructing a building is an
exercise in compromise and owners and design teams need to make the hard
decisions about what is most important.  We have to admit that building a
building on certain sites is more difficult (from an energy perspective) and
then use energy modeling as a tool to help architects and engineers improve
their designs.  We shouldn't be re-writing rules making things easier
because it sends the message to owners, architects and engineers that they
don't really have to change the status-quo.
 
I agree that Appendix G is still "clunky", I constantly wrestle with how to
interpret the different aspects of the methodology and get frustrated at the
effort required to complete the modeling.  The greater flaw (this is said
with the greatest respect for the countless volunteer hours put into
creating Appendix G by the ASHRAE 90.1 folks) I see with Appendix G is that
its genesis was the ECB methodology (Timothy, I think we are in agreement
about this point) which is intended for demonstrating compliance with ASHRAE
90.1.  In my opinion revisions to Appendix G need to occur, these changes
need to take Appendix G away from its "code compliance" roots and towards a
methodology that is easier to automate via software rule sets in a reliable,
repeatable way.  Having automated rule sets will reduce the chance for
gaming and will hopefully make it easier to establish an energy budget early
in the design process which is what we really need.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] LEED Building Orientation


Indeed, count me in on submitting a change proposal. If I recall, everything
we need is on the ASHRAE web site. I would be happy to have what I posted
used a starting point or initial draft for that and hope that others have
ideas for making the proposed changes better still. After all, if
incorporated, you would all be working with it somewhere down the road. Now
is thus a great time to comment or make suggestions.
 
Thanks, Jason, for your questions regarding my proposal. In response to your
last question asking, "would it be fair for two identical buildings that are
located on two different sites, one constrained and one not, to get
different scores?: There are many situations in which the opportunities
related to a site dictate some aspects of how well optimized the design can
be. Given what I proposed, the situation you're asking about would occur
only when the more constrained site of the two was such that it forced a
beneficial orientation. In such cases, the team with the unconstrained site
would be able to compare to a worse baseline building, and thus could get a
higher score for the same design. They would be permitted to do so only
because their site included to opportunity to neglect orientation---and thus
they could have done worse, but they chose to make the best of it and chose
to do the extra work to get credit for that. The incentive is a carrot, not
a stick, and LEED is full of carrots that are not consistently available to
everyone at all times.
 
Thanks, Brandon, for your comments (pasted in below) in response to Jason's
point/question about how "perhaps choosing a bad site that offers limited
opportunities to face the building in a good direction should carry a
negative consequence." I couldn't agree more with what you had to say.
 
The idea of punishment for a choice that we do not always have the luxury of
making is at the root of the issues discussed over the last few days. If one
does overlook the opportunity to choose a better site, they will already be
faced with the consequences of having to design for a worse condition than
they could have. And, someone else will get the opportunity of choosing the
better site they overlooked. My take on this is that added design challenge
and lost return on investment are sufficiently negative consequences (if and
when one actually has the option to choose otherwise). 
 
It seems to me that the language of negative consequences stems in part from
the historical regulatory compliance perspective of 90.1, which is to
prevent designers and builders from making really bad buildings, rather than
to encourage them to make really good ones. Where it is feasible to take
advantage of building and/or glazing orientation, this needs to be rewarded.
My proposal is aimed at doing this without problematic attempts to punish
those who are less attentive to (or less fortunate) regarding this aspects
of site selection.
 
If 90.1 Appendix G is to be effective, it is essential to avoid provisions
that inevitably do as much or more harm than good. A penalty for having a
large west-facing exposure to deal with is very different than, for example,
a penalty to using excessive glass area or requirement for a given level of
insulation in a particular climate, since the design team will, in all
cases, have the opportunity to reduce glazing area and to select insulation
with an appropriate R-value. However, in the case of building sites, if, for
example, they were all distributed evenly along different sides of a
rectangular city block with high development density, then, depending on
climate and building type, somewhere between 50% and 75% of the sites would
be penalized for being "bad." If this city block happened to be in an
established part of Chicago or Milwaukee, for example, where city blocks
tend to have their long axis oriented N-S, the odds of having to build on a
"bad" site are even higher. Where then is the incentive for making the most
of a less-than-ideal situation?
 
Where the starting point, and thus opportunities to "do the right thing,"
may vary with arbitrary external conditions, the Performance Rating Method
needs to focus on positive incentives for encouraging teams to make the most
of what they have to work with. After all, someone has to build on that SW
corner site. So, let's re-focus the method on rewarding designs that turn a
crummy site into a great building. Those who are fortunate enough to be able
to choose a really good site will still get the added benefit of being able
to design for that condition and, in some cases, lowering their operating
costs, improving return on investment, and racking up a few more percentage
points toward EAc1.
 
Does anyone else have comments or suggestions in support of a continuous
maintenance/change proposal to ASHRAE? As I suggested above, now would be a
good time to make your voice heard.
 
Regards,
Timothy

Jason,

The paradigm that we must 'punish bad sites' is one of the actual thorns on
the burr under my saddle.  Why MUST we punish bad sites?  Why not reward
designs making the best of a bad site, and sites where changing the building
orientation is an achievable option?

In my humble opinion Timothy's proposals are right on the money in terms of
how projects work in the real world, and what LEED/ASHRAE 90.1's objectives
ought to be -- namely, reward achievement of attainable objectives.  On the
contrary, it's the arbitrary enforcement of this rotation requirement and
the whole punishment-mindset behind it that actually "misses" something.

OK, who wants to collaborate with me in drafting-up a change proposal?
First off, does anyone have a copy of a previous change proposal for

Timothy,

One issue that your proposals miss is that perhaps choosing a bad site that
offers limited opportunities to face the building in a good direction should
carry a negative consequence. Shouldn't a building that is on a good site
and oriented in such a way to reduce energy use be rated better than a
building located on a poor site that cannot be oriented well?  Also would it
be fair for two identical buildings that are located on two different sites,
one constrained and one not, to get different scores?

Again, please feel free to submit a continuous maintenance proposal to
ASHRAE.

Jason

Hi,

 

Does anyone know of any buildings for which the performance of
sun-tracking movable devices was evaluated using simulation programs?
Does anyone have experience of having done such an analysis? What I
would especially like to know is how to model a dynamic geometry in a
simulation program.

 

Thanks,

Alec:
In 3/6/07 email from Gail Stranske, she reinforces what Marcus Sheffer
indicated in a prior email that exceptional calculation method is to be
used to show process energy savings:

The modeling approach you suggest for process loads would not comply
with the current requirements for LEED.  The 25% process load
requirement is set up as a minimum process load requirement to avoid
underreporting of process load energy usage ( i.e. an office building
reporting 0.25 W/sf of miscellaneous equipment).  However, all projects
are still expected to follow the Appendix G, Table G.3.1.12 requirements
for receptacles and process loads, stating that "these loads shall be
included when calculating the baseline building performance and proposed
building performance").  Unless LEED requirements change, If your
building is expected to consume 60% process energy, it should be modeled
with 60% process energy, and the Percentage Improvement should be
calculated with your projected actual process energy consumption
included in the energy results.  I would echo Marcus' recommendation
unless & until the EA TAG comes up with an alternate solution: 

"In the mean time I would suggest that project teams strive to make all
building energy systems as energy efficient as possible and follow the
exceptional calculation method to show savings for process loads in the
LEED certification review process."
Best Regards,
Gail Stranske

Hi,
I've been asked to provide LEED energy modeling services for a
refrigerated warehouse.  90% of the space in the building will be a -15F
freezer space, with the remainder a small office area.

Under Appendix G, am I correct in interpreting that the unregulated
process loads (i.e. refrigeration equipment) would need to be the same
in the base case and proposed case models?  If so, how would you account
for any improvements to the performance of the refrigeration system
under EACR1?

If we cannot take credit for process performance improvements, I am not
sure how we would manage to capture the pre-requisite 2 points under
EACR1.  

Also, would we be required to model the building using eQuest-R instead
of the temperature bin spreadsheet models we usually use for
refrigeration systems?  I've never found the eQuest-R package to be that
adept at modeling refrigeration systems, although I haven't looked at it
in a while.  Have there been any recent improvements to its
capabilities?

Thanks for any sage advice as to how this type of project has been
successfully handled in the past.

Sincerely,
Alec Stevens, PE, LEED AP

There's no better time than the present to start doing things differently. 
 
Thinking through and getting feedback from other users of Appendix G
regarding a proposed change (before submitting a formal continuous
maintenance proposal to ASHRAE) is just the first step in that direction.

I think it is great that the topic of building orientation is generating so
much conversation. But the way to get this thing changed is to submit a
formal continuous maintenance proposal to ASHRAE. If you make a convincing
enough argument, the committee will approve the change. I see lots of great
ideas from this list about what is wrong with Appendix G, but few change
proposals ever get submitted to ASHRAE.

Jason, Brandon, and others doing building simulation for LEED:

 

Great to see all of the discussion this topic is generating. It seems well
worth considering how better to provide an incentive for orientation without
needless hassles and penalties. If you?re interested in doing so, please
read on and comment.

 

The 90.1-2004 Appendix G requirement for averaging the results of four
baseline building orientations is, as described by previous comments in this
discussion, a somewhat arbitrary and often problematic means of attempting
to give credit (or penalty) for building orientation. It can also be a
time-consuming pain either when overshadowing from adjacent buildings is
modeled (fixed shades), and thus the site shape and coordinate origin may
not make sense for a rotated building, or when attempting to compare
benefits over the baseline model related to specific strategies (i.e.,
baseline+X vs. baseline+Y, acknowledging that relative comparisons of
strategies can and should most often still be made without ever rotating
anything).  

 

Of potentially even greater concern, in some cases, such as on a very narrow
site with N-S major axis, the current requirement needlessly penalizes
(i.e., deducts credit from) a design that may be making the best of a
constrained situation. Thus, even if the process of generating and averaging
baseline performance results for all four orientations were fully automated
in the simulation tools, which would alleviate the time and hassle, the
current approach would still impose an unfair and unhelpful penalty on
certain projects that are forced to orient their building along a N-S axis
or with a large SE, SW, or W exposure, etc. 

 

However, I agree that we do need some method of encouraging and rewarding
beneficial building orientations where applicable. 

 

It appears the draft Addendum R language that was never approved was one
idea for how to address some of the issues described above. I would hazard a
guess that it was not approved because of the tendency for such language of
"exceptions" to become a loophole open to interpretation and gaming, and
thus something likely to weaken the performance rating method and generate
more work for reviewers, not to mention superfluous LEED credit
interpretation rulings. 

 

I support the idea of a positive incentive or opportunity offered by the
option for comparing to the averaged results for the rotated baseline
building, plus a similar option with respect to glazing orientation, if and
when permitted by straightforward criteria. I would propose the following
requirements be met for the optional use of such averaged values for the
baseline building


 

The project would need to show simple documentation that one of the two
options was indeed applicable, and thus they should be permitted to use the
associated method for adjusting the baseline building results: 

 

Option 1) Demonstrate via a simple sketch or other graphic representation
that there is space on the site for the same total building footprint area
to be re-shaped to be either more nearly square in terms of solar
orientation OR to be rotated at least 60 degrees (or similar value TBD) from
the design orientation---thus it would have been possible and plausible to
neglect building orientation. In this case the team would be permitted to
compare to an average of rotated baseline building results as in 90.1-2004
Appendix G. As with Appendix G, overshadowing from adjacent buildings, etc.
would need to be modeled as a fixed shading item that does not rotate with
the building. For cases where the proposed building orientation is elongated
and rotated by something less than 60 degrees (or whatever similar threshold
was established for this option)---for example, rotated 45 degrees from the
orientation of the major axis of the site, adjacent road, adjacent
buildings, etc.---and there is not enough space on the site to rotate it a
full 60 degrees, the team should be permitted (if they see fit) to compare
to a baseline result that is the average of just two orientations of the
very same footprint: the proposed orientation and whatever they believe to
be the worst orientation of the same footprint shape that would actually
still fit on the site. If Option #1 were selected, doing so would eliminate
Option #2 in order to avoid double counting.

 

Option 2) Demonstrate with simple table of summed values that the glazing
fraction or window-to-wall ratio (WWR) for the facades on the proposed
design is asymmetric in terms of orientation (e.g., differences are greater
than 5%), AND confirm that this is NOT an outcome forced by an immediately
adjacent building or other constraint of the physical building site, but
rather a deliberate design strategy---thus the design could have neglected
any such orientation of WWR. In this case the team would be permitted to
compare their design to a baseline with identical WWR for all fa?ade
orientations---i.e., evenly distributed glazing as indicated by WWR (but not
a rotated building, as in Option #1).

 

The idea here is to permit teams to get credit for either building
orientation OR glazing orientation on the building if they believe it to be
significant AND it would have been possible to neglect it. 

 

If neither of these options were applicable and implemented, the baseline
building would simply be modeled in the same orientation as the proposed
design and with the same proportional distribution of WWR, in keeping with
90.1 WWR limits.  

 

I do not believe it is workable to penalize those who neglect orientation,
as the present Appendix G attempts to do, without creating other
inappropriate penalties and deterrents that we all really could do without.
The penalty for those who neglect orientation where there was a significant
potential to benefit from doing otherwise would, in what I have proposed,
simply be the foregone opportunity to do better and get credit for it. Thus
building orientation would be recognized and treated in much the same manner
as most other performance-related architectural design strategies.

  

I'm interested in what others think of these ideas as possible means of
addressing concerns raised in this discussion. Perhaps, Jason, you could
forward this to the 90.1 committee people that are involved specifically
with the Performance Rating Method (along with related or subsequent
comments from others on the BLDG-SIM forum). Hopefully we can move this
forward.

 

Best,

Timothy

Thanks Jason,

The 'burr' under my saddle on this issue is that the 'averaged buiilding',
and therefore the baseline to which all project EEMs are to be compared,
does not exist, not even in the simulation software.

While we may have four perfectly good orientations, any one of which could
be used as a baseline (think .SIM file), there simply exists no .SIM file
for the averaged building.  It would need to be created (as of this writing)
manually, and the result could not be used easily, let alone seamlessly, as
the baseline for alternative comparisons within eQuest.

Suggestions:

1. Allow selecting the orientation closest to, without performing worse
than, the 'average total annual energy consumption' as the baseline.  This
simple change would allow all baseline numbers to reside within the analysis
software.

2. Make this requirement optional, for those buildings which can benefit
from orientation optimization.  In other words, promote achievable
incentives instead of enforcing arbitrary punishments.

Wish I had more time to help out with 90.1 -- maybe next year!

Peter and Brandon,

This looks like an issue that you have a strong opinion so perhaps consider
contributing a better solution. Anyone can propose a change to 90.1.
Further, if you examine this history of the ECB subcommittee, I think you
would find that we are open to good ideas and are trying to balance multiple
needs. The building rotation concept replaced a much worse concept of
spreading the windows around the building evenly.
  Maybe you can find a better solution. I believe we need to reward those
that do make an effort to orient their building
  and windows to save energy and penalize those that make poor design
choices about building orientation and window placement.  The building
rotation idea has traction because most of the effort needed for each
rotation is just to rerun the simulation with the building azimuth changed.
We thought that was simple.  It is an issue that has been discussed many
times in the ECB subcommittee and a few times at the full committee level.

I look forward to your suggestions.

Jason

Indeed, count me in on submitting a change proposal. If I recall, everything we need is on the ASHRAE web site. I would be happy to have what I posted used a starting point or initial draft for that and hope that others have ideas for making the proposed changes better still. After all, if incorporated, you would all be working with it somewhere down the road. Now is thus a great time to comment or make suggestions.

Thanks, Jason, for your questions regarding my proposal. In response to your last question asking, "would it be fair for two identical buildings that are located on two different sites, one constrained and one not, to get different scores?: There are many situations in which the opportunities related to a site dictate some aspects of how well optimized the design can be. Given what I proposed, the situation you're asking about would occur only when the more constrained site of the two was such that it forced a beneficial orientation. In such cases, the team with the unconstrained site would be able to compare to a worse baseline building, and thus could get a higher score for the same design. They would be permitted to do so only because their site included to opportunity to neglect orientation---and thus they could have done worse, but they chose to make the best of it and chose to do the extra work to get credit for that. The incentive is a carrot, not a stick, and LEED is full of carrots that are not consistently available to everyone at all times.

Thanks, Brandon, for your comments (pasted in below) in response to Jason's point/question about how "perhaps choosing a bad site that offers limited opportunities to face the building in a good direction should carry a negative consequence." I couldn't agree more with what you had to say.

The idea of punishment for a choice that we do not always have the luxury of making is at the root of the issues discussed over the last few days. If one does overlook the opportunity to choose a better site, they will already be faced with the consequences of having to design for a worse condition than they could have. And, someone else will get the opportunity of choosing the better site they overlooked. My take on this is that added design challenge and lost return on investment are sufficiently negative consequences (if and when one actually has the option to choose otherwise). 

It seems to me that the language of negative consequences stems in part from the historical regulatory compliance perspective of 90.1, which is to prevent designers and builders from making really bad buildings, rather than to encourage them to make really good ones. Where it is feasible to take advantage of building and/or glazing orientation, this needs to be rewarded. My proposal is aimed at doing this without problematic attempts to punish those who are less attentive to (or less fortunate) regarding this aspects of site selection.

If 90.1 Appendix G is to be effective, it is essential to avoid provisions that inevitably do as much or more harm than good. A penalty for having a large west-facing exposure to deal with is very different than, for example, a penalty to using excessive glass area or requirement for a given level of insulation in a particular climate, since the design team will, in all cases, have the opportunity to reduce glazing area and to select insulation with an appropriate R-value. However, in the case of building sites, if, for example, they were all distributed evenly along different sides of a rectangular city block with high development density, then, depending on climate and building type, somewhere between 50% and 75% of the sites would be penalized for being "bad." If this city block happened to be in an established part of Chicago or Milwaukee, for example, where city blocks tend to have their long axis oriented N-S, the odds of having to build on a "bad" site are even higher. Where then is the incentive for making the most of a less-than-ideal situation?

Where the starting point, and thus opportunities to "do the right thing," may vary with arbitrary external conditions, the Performance Rating Method needs to focus on positive incentives for encouraging teams to make the most of what they have to work with. After all, someone has to build on that SW corner site. So, let's re-focus the method on rewarding designs that turn a crummy site into a great building. Those who are fortunate enough to be able to choose a really good site will still get the added benefit of being able to design for that condition and, in some cases, lowering their operating costs, improving return on investment, and racking up a few more percentage points toward EAc1.

Does anyone else have comments or suggestions in support of a continuous maintenance/change proposal to ASHRAE? As I suggested above, now would be a good time to make your voice heard.

Regards,
Timothy

Jason,

The paradigm that we must 'punish bad sites' is one of the actual thorns on the burr under my saddle.  Why MUST we punish bad sites?  Why not reward designs making the best of a bad site, and sites where changing the building orientation is an achievable option?

In my humble opinion Timothy's proposals are right on the money in terms of how projects work in the real world, and what LEED/ASHRAE 90.1's objectives ought to be -- namely, reward achievement of attainable objectives.  On the contrary, it's the arbitrary enforcement of this rotation requirement and the whole punishment-mindset behind it that actually "misses" something.

OK, who wants to collaborate with me in drafting-up a change proposal?  First off, does anyone have a copy of a previous change proposal for formatting, contact info etc. reference?  Enough talk, time for action!

  All,

  Enough talk, time for action!  Who wants to collaborate in drafting-up a change proposal?  Timothy, it sounds like you're on board.

  Timothy,

  One issue that your proposals miss is that perhaps choosing a bad site that offers limited opportunities to face the building in a good direction should carry a negative consequence. Shouldn't a building that is on a good site and oriented in such a way to reduce energy use be rated better than a building located on a poor site that cannot be oriented well?  Also would it be fair for two identical buildings that are located on two different sites, one constrained and one not, to get different scores?

  Again, please feel free to submit a continuous maintenance proposal to ASHRAE.

All,

Enough talk, time for action!  Who wants to collaborate in drafting-up a change proposal?  Timothy, it sounds like you're on board.  

First off, does anyone have a copy of a previous change proposal for formatting, contact info etc. reference?

Timothy,

One issue that your proposals miss is that perhaps choosing a bad site that offers limited opportunities to face the building in a good direction should carry a negative consequence. Shouldn't a building that is on a good site and oriented in such a way to reduce energy use be rated better than a building located on a poor site that cannot be oriented well?  Also would it be fair for two identical buildings that are located on two different sites, one constrained and one not, to get different scores?

Again, please feel free to submit a continuous maintenance proposal to ASHRAE.

Jason

I think it is great that the topic of building orientation is generating so much conversation. But the way to get this thing changed is to submit a formal continuous maintenance proposal to ASHRAE. If you make a convincing enough argument, the committee will approve the change. I see lots of great ideas from this list about what is wrong with Appendix G, but few change proposals ever get submitted to ASHRAE.

Jason, Brandon, and others doing building simulation for LEED:
 
Great to see all of the discussion this topic is generating. It seems well worth considering how better to provide an incentive for orientation without needless hassles and penalties. If you?re interested in doing so, please read on and comment.
 
The 90.1-2004 Appendix G requirement for averaging the results of four baseline building orientations is, as described by previous comments in this discussion, a somewhat arbitrary and often problematic means of attempting to give credit (or penalty) for building orientation. It can also be a time-consuming pain either when overshadowing from adjacent buildings is modeled (fixed shades), and thus the site shape and coordinate origin may not make sense for a rotated building, or when attempting to compare benefits over the baseline model related to specific strategies (i.e., baseline+X vs. baseline+Y, acknowledging that relative comparisons of strategies can and should most often still be made without ever rotating anything).  
 
Of potentially even greater concern, in some cases, such as on a very narrow site with N-S major axis, the current requirement needlessly penalizes (i.e., deducts credit from) a design that may be making the best of a constrained situation. Thus, even if the process of generating and averaging baseline performance results for all four orientations were fully automated in the simulation tools, which would alleviate the time and hassle, the current approach would still impose an unfair and unhelpful penalty on certain projects that are forced to orient their building along a N-S axis or with a large SE, SW, or W exposure, etc. 
 
However, I agree that we do need some method of encouraging and rewarding beneficial building orientations where applicable. 
 
It appears the draft Addendum R language that was never approved was one idea for how to address some of the issues described above. I would hazard a guess that it was not approved because of the tendency for such language of "exceptions" to become a loophole open to interpretation and gaming, and thus something likely to weaken the performance rating method and generate more work for reviewers, not to mention superfluous LEED credit interpretation rulings. 
 
I support the idea of a positive incentive or opportunity offered by the option for comparing to the averaged results for the rotated baseline building, plus a similar option with respect to glazing orientation, if and when permitted by straightforward criteria. I would propose the following requirements be met for the optional use of such averaged values for the baseline building?
 
The project would need to show simple documentation that one of the two options was indeed applicable, and thus they should be permitted to use the associated method for adjusting the baseline building results: 
 
Option 1) Demonstrate via a simple sketch or other graphic representation that there is space on the site for the same total building footprint area to be re-shaped to be either more nearly square in terms of solar orientation OR to be rotated at least 60 degrees (or similar value TBD) from the design orientation---thus it would have been possible and plausible to neglect building orientation. In this case the team would be permitted to compare to an average of rotated baseline building results as in 90.1-2004 Appendix G. As with Appendix G, overshadowing from adjacent buildings, etc. would need to be modeled as a fixed shading item that does not rotate with the building. For cases where the proposed building orientation is elongated and rotated by something less than 60 degrees (or whatever similar threshold was established for this option)---for example, rotated 45 degrees from the orientation of the major axis of the site, adjacent road, adjacent buildings, etc.---and there is not enough space on the site to rotate it a full 60 degrees, the team should be permitted (if they see fit) to compare to a baseline result that is the average of just two orientations of the very same footprint: the proposed orientation and whatever they believe to be the worst orientation of the same footprint shape that would actually still fit on the site. If Option #1 were selected, doing so would eliminate Option #2 in order to avoid double counting.
 
Option 2) Demonstrate with simple table of summed values that the glazing fraction or window-to-wall ratio (WWR) for the facades on the proposed design is asymmetric in terms of orientation (e.g., differences are greater than 5%), AND confirm that this is NOT an outcome forced by an immediately adjacent building or other constraint of the physical building site, but rather a deliberate design strategy---thus the design could have neglected any such orientation of WWR. In this case the team would be permitted to compare their design to a baseline with identical WWR for all fa?ade orientations---i.e., evenly distributed glazing as indicated by WWR (but not a rotated building, as in Option #1).
 
The idea here is to permit teams to get credit for either building orientation OR glazing orientation on the building if they believe it to be significant AND it would have been possible to neglect it. 
 
If neither of these options were applicable and implemented, the baseline building would simply be modeled in the same orientation as the proposed design and with the same proportional distribution of WWR, in keeping with 90.1 WWR limits.  
 
I do not believe it is workable to penalize those who neglect orientation, as the present Appendix G attempts to do, without creating other inappropriate penalties and deterrents that we all really could do without. The penalty for those who neglect orientation where there was a significant potential to benefit from doing otherwise would, in what I have proposed, simply be the foregone opportunity to do better and get credit for it. Thus building orientation would be recognized and treated in much the same manner as most other performance-related architectural design strategies.
  
I'm interested in what others think of these ideas as possible means of addressing concerns raised in this discussion. Perhaps, Jason, you could forward this to the 90.1 committee people that are involved specifically with the Performance Rating Method (along with related or subsequent comments from others on the BLDG-SIM forum). Hopefully we can move this forward.
 
Best,
Timothy

Thanks Jason,

The 'burr' under my saddle on this issue is that the 'averaged buiilding', and therefore the baseline to which all project EEMs are to be compared, does not exist, not even in the simulation software.
While we may have four perfectly good orientations, any one of which could be used as a baseline (think .SIM file), there simply exists no .SIM file for the averaged building.  It would need to be created (as of this writing) manually, and the result could not be used easily, let alone seamlessly, as the baseline for alternative comparisons within eQuest.
Suggestions:
1. Allow selecting the orientation closest to, without performing worse than, the 'average total annual energy consumption' as the baseline.  This simple change would allow all baseline numbers to reside within the analysis software.
2. Make this requirement optional, for those buildings which can benefit from orientation optimization.  In other words, promote achievable incentives instead of enforcing arbitrary punishments.
Wish I had more time to help out with 90.1 -- maybe next year!

Peter and Brandon,

This looks like an issue that you have a strong opinion so perhaps consider contributing a better solution. Anyone can propose a change to 90.1. Further, if you examine this history of the ECB subcommittee, I think you would find that we are open to good ideas and are trying to balance multiple needs. The building rotation concept replaced a much worse concept of spreading the windows around the building evenly.
  Maybe you can find a better solution. I believe we need to reward those that do make an effort to orient their building
  and windows to save energy and penalize those that make poor design choices about building orientation and window placement.  The building rotation idea has traction because most of the effort needed for each rotation is just to rerun the simulation with the building azimuth changed. We thought that was simple.  It is an issue that has been discussed many times in the ECB subcommittee and a few times at the full committee level.

I look forward to your suggestions.

Jason

Using it is why there is so much gaming going on the LEED world, and why LEED is so rapidly is losing creditability among energy professionals. Ed Mazria has the best approach, use 50% of CBECS via Target Finder to set the benchmark and then move that bar to energy neutrality by 2030. Yes, CBECS has limitations as far as building types and distribution in some locations, but let's work on EIA to improve on that. So set the benchmark based on 50% of CBECS, run your project using the rule set in the Baseline Building Performance column in Appendix G3.1 and the percent difference becomes your performance score. Moving Appendix G from an informative to a normative appendix will not solve the problem. That would only institutionalize a flawed approach.> > > > Regards> > > > Harvey> > > > > > Harvey Bryan, Ph.D., FAIA, LEED AP> > Professor of Architecture> > School of Architecture> > Arizona State University> > P.O.

Anyone can propose a change to 90.1. Further, if you examine this history of the ECB subcommittee, I think you would find that we are open to good ideas and are trying to balance multiple needs. The building rotation concept replaced a much worse concept of spreading the windows around the building evenly.> Maybe you can find a better solution. I believe we need to reward those that do make an effort to orient their building> and windows to save energy and penalize those that make poor design choices about building orientation and window placement. The building rotation idea has traction because most of the effort needed for each rotation is just to rerun the simulation with the building azimuth changed. We thought that was simple. It is an issue that has been discussed many times in the ECB subcommittee and a few times at the full committee level.> > I look forward to your suggestions.> > Jason> > > > On 11/30/2007 8:34 AM, Peter Simmonds wrote:> > Here here Brandon.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] DEADLINE EXTENDED:  SimBuild 2008 - Abstracts Due December 8
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200712032355.AA555900pd50004198731@gard.com>

Please excuse the cross-postings...

 

The abstract submission phase for SimBuild 2008 has been extended to
December 8.  

 

IBPSA-USA is accepting abstracts for SimBuild 2008 only until December
8!

Abstracts may be submitted via our website at
http://gaia.lbl.gov/ocs/index.php/simbuild/2008

 

Student scholarships will be available on a competitive basis to be
awarded according to the quality of the submitted paper.

 

Please note that Dec. 8, 2007 is a firm deadline for all abstracts. See
below for more information about SimBuild 2008 including other key
deadlines.

 

SimBuild 2008

 

IBPSA-USA will hold its third national conference, July 30 to August 1,
2008 on the campus of the University of California at Berkeley. The
format will be similar to the two previous SimBuild conferences held at
the University of Colorado at Boulder in 2004 and at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in 2006.

 

The conference organizers are limiting the number of peer-reviewed oral
presentations in order to maintain a high level of quality in the
papers.  Submissions will therefore be rigorously peer-reviewed.
Abstracts are due by 1 December 2007 (firm deadline) and may be on a
variety of building and environmental simulation topics, such as: system
or component modeling, simulation algorithm development, CFD
applications, IAQ, acoustics, energy, lighting, life safety, weather,
city-scale environmental simulations, or case studies that exhibit
in-depth use of simulation software.  Authors should indicate a
preference for poster or oral presentation.  In addition, a limited
number of non-peer-reviewed oral presentations (seminar type) are sought
in order to enable practitioners and researchers to address
simulation-related issues of strong current interest, such as topics
related low or Zero Energy Buildings, performance based code compliance
- please contact Philip Haves <phaves at lbl.gov> <mailto:phaves at lbl.gov>
(510) 486 6512.

 

The meeting is open to all, world-wide. Being near San Francisco,
Berkeley is a convenient destination for travelers from major cities in
the U.S. and in many other countries.  U.C. Berkeley is the oldest
campus of the University of California system, which also operates the
well-known Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the Lawrence Hall of
Science, the Space Sciences Laboratory, and the U.C. Botanical Garden.
The city of Berkeley contains a variety of neighborhoods with diverse
character and excellent restaurants.  The "Bay Area" is full of visitor
attractions accessible within 20 minutes, such as the city of San
Francisco, scenic mountains, and rich architecture (including the Frank
Lloyd Wright Civic Center).  Numerous wineries are within one hour
travel to the Napa and Sonoma valleys, where wine-tasting tours are
available.   

 

Key Dates:

Sep 15                 Call for abstracts

Dec 8                   Abstracts due (firm deadline)

Dec 20                 Abstract acceptance

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Dedicated Fresh Air
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200712031031.AA3100203pd80004197185@gard.com>

I am fairly new to eQuest and am trying to model a building with a demand based dedicated fresh air VAV system as well as a cooling only VAV system.  Is there any way to model two units serving the same zone?  I am also curious if anyone knows the best way to deal with occupancy and CO2 sensors as a part of my demand based fresh air system.  Any guidance you might have would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Jason, Brandon, and others doing building simulation for LEED:

 

Great to see all of the discussion this topic is generating. It seems well
worth considering how better to provide an incentive for orientation without
needless hassles and penalties. If you?re interested in doing so, please
read on and comment.

 

The 90.1-2004 Appendix G requirement for averaging the results of four
baseline building orientations is, as described by previous comments in this
discussion, a somewhat arbitrary and often problematic means of attempting
to give credit (or penalty) for building orientation. It can also be a
time-consuming pain either when overshadowing from adjacent buildings is
modeled (fixed shades), and thus the site shape and coordinate origin may
not make sense for a rotated building, or when attempting to compare
benefits over the baseline model related to specific strategies (i.e.,
baseline+X vs. baseline+Y, acknowledging that relative comparisons of
strategies can and should most often still be made without ever rotating
anything).  

 

Of potentially even greater concern, in some cases, such as on a very narrow
site with N-S major axis, the current requirement needlessly penalizes
(i.e., deducts credit from) a design that may be making the best of a
constrained situation. Thus, even if the process of generating and averaging
baseline performance results for all four orientations were fully automated
in the simulation tools, which would alleviate the time and hassle, the
current approach would still impose an unfair and unhelpful penalty on
certain projects that are forced to orient their building along a N-S axis
or with a large SE, SW, or W exposure, etc. 

 

However, I agree that we do need some method of encouraging and rewarding
beneficial building orientations where applicable. 

 

It appears the draft Addendum R language that was never approved was one
idea for how to address some of the issues described above. I would hazard a
guess that it was not approved because of the tendency for such language of
"exceptions" to become a loophole open to interpretation and gaming, and
thus something likely to weaken the performance rating method and generate
more work for reviewers, not to mention superfluous LEED credit
interpretation rulings. 

 

I support the idea of a positive incentive or opportunity offered by the
option for comparing to the averaged results for the rotated baseline
building, plus a similar option with respect to glazing orientation, if and
when permitted by straightforward criteria. I would propose the following
requirements be met for the optional use of such averaged values for the
baseline building


 

The project would need to show simple documentation that one of the two
options was indeed applicable, and thus they should be permitted to use the
associated method for adjusting the baseline building results: 

 

Option 1) Demonstrate via a simple sketch or other graphic representation
that there is space on the site for the same total building footprint area
to be re-shaped to be either more nearly square in terms of solar
orientation OR to be rotated at least 60 degrees (or similar value TBD) from
the design orientation---thus it would have been possible and plausible to
neglect building orientation. In this case the team would be permitted to
compare to an average of rotated baseline building results as in 90.1-2004
Appendix G. As with Appendix G, overshadowing from adjacent buildings, etc.
would need to be modeled as a fixed shading item that does not rotate with
the building. For cases where the proposed building orientation is elongated
and rotated by something less than 60 degrees (or whatever similar threshold
was established for this option)---for example, rotated 45 degrees from the
orientation of the major axis of the site, adjacent road, adjacent
buildings, etc.---and there is not enough space on the site to rotate it a
full 60 degrees, the team should be permitted (if they see fit) to compare
to a baseline result that is the average of just two orientations of the
very same footprint: the proposed orientation and whatever they believe to
be the worst orientation of the same footprint shape that would actually
still fit on the site. If Option #1 were selected, doing so would eliminate
Option #2 in order to avoid double counting.

 

Option 2) Demonstrate with simple table of summed values that the glazing
fraction or window-to-wall ratio (WWR) for the facades on the proposed
design is asymmetric in terms of orientation (e.g., differences are greater
than 5%), AND confirm that this is NOT an outcome forced by an immediately
adjacent building or other constraint of the physical building site, but
rather a deliberate design strategy---thus the design could have neglected
any such orientation of WWR. In this case the team would be permitted to
compare their design to a baseline with identical WWR for all fa?ade
orientations---i.e., evenly distributed glazing as indicated by WWR (but not
a rotated building, as in Option #1).

 

The idea here is to permit teams to get credit for either building
orientation OR glazing orientation on the building if they believe it to be
significant AND it would have been possible to neglect it. 

 

If neither of these options were applicable and implemented, the baseline
building would simply be modeled in the same orientation as the proposed
design and with the same proportional distribution of WWR, in keeping with
90.1 WWR limits.  

 

I do not believe it is workable to penalize those who neglect orientation,
as the present Appendix G attempts to do, without creating other
inappropriate penalties and deterrents that we all really could do without.
The penalty for those who neglect orientation where there was a significant
potential to benefit from doing otherwise would, in what I have proposed,
simply be the foregone opportunity to do better and get credit for it. Thus
building orientation would be recognized and treated in much the same manner
as most other performance-related architectural design strategies.

  

I'm interested in what others think of these ideas as possible means of
addressing concerns raised in this discussion. Perhaps, Jason, you could
forward this to the 90.1 committee people that are involved specifically
with the Performance Rating Method (along with related or subsequent
comments from others on the BLDG-SIM forum). Hopefully we can move this
forward.

 

Best,

Timothy

Thanks Jason,

The 'burr' under my saddle on this issue is that the 'averaged buiilding',
and therefore the baseline to which all project EEMs are to be compared,
does not exist, not even in the simulation software.

While we may have four perfectly good orientations, any one of which could
be used as a baseline (think .SIM file), there simply exists no .SIM file
for the averaged building.  It would need to be created (as of this writing)
manually, and the result could not be used easily, let alone seamlessly, as
the baseline for alternative comparisons within eQuest.

Suggestions:

1. Allow selecting the orientation closest to, without performing worse
than, the 'average total annual energy consumption' as the baseline.  This
simple change would allow all baseline numbers to reside within the analysis
software.

2. Make this requirement optional, for those buildings which can benefit
from orientation optimization.  In other words, promote achievable
incentives instead of enforcing arbitrary punishments.

Wish I had more time to help out with 90.1 -- maybe next year!

Peter and Brandon,

This looks like an issue that you have a strong opinion so perhaps consider
contributing a better solution. Anyone can propose a change to 90.1.
Further, if you examine this history of the ECB subcommittee, I think you
would find that we are open to good ideas and are trying to balance multiple
needs. The building rotation concept replaced a much worse concept of
spreading the windows around the building evenly.
  Maybe you can find a better solution. I believe we need to reward those
that do make an effort to orient their building
  and windows to save energy and penalize those that make poor design
choices about building orientation and window placement.  The building
rotation idea has traction because most of the effort needed for each
rotation is just to rerun the simulation with the building azimuth changed.
We thought that was simple.  It is an issue that has been discussed many
times in the ECB subcommittee and a few times at the full committee level.

I look forward to your suggestions.

Jason

I agree - the Appendix G approach is painful, and there isn't a significant difference in the orientations. I have found a more signifant difference with thinner longer floorplates. 
 
Regarding 90.1 v/s CBECS, I think Harvey has a good point. The only issue I see is that you are comparing a hypothetical condition very dependent on usage schedules and settings to an actual measured condition. There is still a lot of room for 'gaming' the system (potentially more so). 
 
Personally, I would like to see a study similar to the cost/sf data for LEED projects focusing on kBTU/sf for LEED projects. There might already be one (if so, I would love to see it).

We are never going to get anywhere using Proposed Building Performance column in Appendix G3.1, it creates an abstract reference that has no basis in reality. Using it is why there is so much gaming going on the LEED world, and why LEED is so rapidly is losing creditability among energy professionals. Ed Mazria has the best approach, use 50% of CBECS via Target Finder to set the benchmark and then move that bar to energy neutrality by 2030. Yes, CBECS has limitations as far as building types and distribution in some locations, but let's work on EIA to improve on that. So set the benchmark based on 50% of CBECS, run your project using the rule set in the Baseline Building Performance column in Appendix G3.1 and the percent difference becomes your performance score. Moving Appendix G from an informative to a normative appendix will not solve the problem. That would only institutionalize a flawed approach.

Thanks Jason,

The 'burr' under my saddle on this issue is that the 'averaged buiilding', and therefore the baseline to which all project EEMs are to be compared, does not exist, not even in the simulation software.

While we may have four perfectly good orientations, any one of which could be used as a baseline (think .SIM file), there simply exists no .SIM file for the averaged building.  It would need to be created (as of this writing) manually, and the result could not be used easily, let alone seamlessly, as the baseline for alternative comparisons within eQuest.

Suggestions:

1. Allow selecting the orientation closest to, without performing worse than, the 'average total annual energy consumption' as the baseline.  This simple change would allow all baseline numbers to reside within the analysis software.

2. Make this requirement optional, for those buildings which can benefit from orientation optimization.  In other words, promote achievable incentives instead of enforcing arbitrary punishments.

Wish I had more time to help out with 90.1 -- maybe next year!

Peter and Brandon,

This looks like an issue that you have a strong opinion so perhaps consider contributing a better solution. Anyone can propose a change to 90.1. Further, if you examine this history of the ECB subcommittee, I think you would find that we are open to good ideas and are trying to balance multiple needs. The building rotation concept replaced a much worse concept of spreading the windows around the building evenly.
  Maybe you can find a better solution. I believe we need to reward those that do make an effort to orient their building
  and windows to save energy and penalize those that make poor design choices about building orientation and window placement.  The building rotation idea has traction because most of the effort needed for each rotation is just to rerun the simulation with the building azimuth changed. We thought that was simple.  It is an issue that has been discussed many times in the ECB subcommittee and a few times at the full committee level.

I look forward to your suggestions.

Jason

BLDG-SIM Members,

In an effort to make managing mailing lists a bit easier and
free up some bandwidth at work, I have decided to move
mailing list hosting from the GARD.COM domain to a new

Minu,
  I did, although at this point I don't recall how (whether 
I wrote a new
model for it or whether I used some performance data from the
manufacturer). I can look back at it if you are interested.
Cheers,
  David

Several people have asked about the existing archive. The 
archive was copied to the new server:

http://lists.onebuilding.org/pipermail/bldg-sim-onebuilding.org/

You can search from the first message on March 4, 1999 
through the over 5000 messages posted since.  The new 
archive includes messages posted on the same day.  That is 
much better than when I updated the archive manually on 
GARD.COM every few months.

The search engine reindexes the archive each night.  In 
addition, I think Google will by crawling the 
onebuilding.org web site soon so you will be able to search 
using Google.

Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Title 24 Compliance using eQuest & Error
Message-ID: <da943e850712070956g7bfc52b0p9941659bda2f1c12@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am using eQuest for Title 24 compliance. When the compliance analysis
run reaches around 15% and its at Generating Proposed Building, the analysis
stops and loads the BDL and prompts that: Error(s) encountered Evaluating
PostProposed Input Rulelist...

After clicking yes to the view the errors, the message reads as shown below:

Error Code             Message

Error                     CRule::Eval() error posting symbolic(value
1.6397e-165) result to BDL


If I run a normal simulation (non Title24) there are no errors, it runs as
expected. There are no errors in the BDL. I encounter this error only when
running a Title 24 compliance analysis.

I am reading the Volume 5: Compliance Analysis section Compliance Rule
Processor and whatever i have gathered is that there is 'something' that has
not been input correctly, but is there a way to find what that
'something' is, or do i have to go through each and every input. Any
pointers to how to resolve this would be greatly appreciated?


Best regards,

Gaurav Mehta

If I have 10 identical boilers in a building, do I need to define a

the INSTALLED-NUMBER keyword in DOE2.1E?  If each boiler also has a
pump, do I also need to define 10 different pumps?

Doug,

Are the boilers you're modeling on completely separate circulation loops, or
are they all on one hot water loop?

Doug,

There doesn't appear to be an option to specify multiple boiler copies from
a checkbox in the eQuest interface.  You may be able to insert
INSTALLED-NUMBER keyword in the .inp file.  I haven't tried that, so I don't
know if it will work.

If you want all 10 boilers to be identical, when you create the new
boiler(s), select "Link to existing component" in the creation option box
and <name of template boiler> in the link component to option box from the
create boiler window.  The new boiler(s) will be linked to the original or
template boiler.  If you don't change any parameters in the cloned
boiler(s), you can make changes in the template boiler and the changes
automatically propagate to the clone(s).  If you create a pump for the
original boiler and check the "link all assigned components" box in the
create boiler window when you're making your clone boiler, a copy of the
pump will also be created for the new boiler.

Once you've got all your boilers created, have a look in the help files
about boiler staging.  You'll find the boiler equipment control button/link
in the controls tab of the circulation loop that the boilers are attached
to.  

Steven

They would be all on the same primary loop, but each would have it's own
pump.  A secondary loop would deliver how water out to the building.

What is the greatest amount of glazing (% of wall) you have been able to
model via the performance rating method to demonstrate a 10.5% savings
over 90.1-2004?

I have several models for 20-30 story condo projects where maximum
glazing is desired by the owner and I am tasked with modeling these
glass towers.  I'm just curious if I am trying to achieve the
impossible... 

 

Thanks in advance!

Netscape automatically sorts my mail on over 7 accounts that are further 
sorted by source, content, keywords, etc.

I have to use Internet Explorer but have never hooked up any Email to 
it; and thanks to the vulnerabilities
"accidentally" left in I.E..

I have machines that have never been on the Internet.

Microsoft forces updates on us with little if any warning, and some of 
those updates have left me with a
stone dead machine with no warning.  Microsoft is also assuring that I 
HAVE to buy a new machine
because they won't have updates for old hardware and/or the updates will 
not work on old hardware.
Microsoft is in the business of selling training on many different 
levels, and they can ensure that training
will be obsolete sooner or later by introducing a completely new 
operating system.  Even Symantec is
having problems mistakenly identifying an Internet content filter 
program as a virus and killing hundreds
of thousands of computers in the last 90 days !!!  Some of these 
computers needed  a raw cold reload
-- not even operating system updates loaded.........

M$ also generates a "Bonus Level" of activity that their customers pay 
for by releasing new operating
systems before they are ready.  There's a reason they don't call that 
thing a "GATE--WAY" any more.
They call it a router because that is what it is doing to your money.......

PLEASE TELL US  WELL BEFORE YOU MAKE CHANGES.

Message-ID: <69a9bc0a0712110838l399c490cp613f4b34dbde6232@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm doing a preliminary LEED review for a client who has a large laboratory
building (not covered under Energy Star).  The building is served by a
central campus steam plant and has an absorption chiller so both heating and
cooling are provided by central steam.  The building has been operational
for well over 15 years, but the steam is not metered.  Are we SOL for LEED
EB?  Does anyone know of an alternate way to set a baseline, other than
metering for 3 years and delaying implementing energy efficiency
improvements?  Unfortunately submitting a CIR requires us to register first
when we may not even be able to attempt LEED!

Thanks for your replies.

Dear all,

I need to model a building with wood studs in wall type for a LEED project. Does anyone know how to define this construction in eQUEST? I only find the layer definition in detail mode of eQUEST. I am wondering whether I only need to define equivalent U-value for the insulation layer or is there any better method?

Thanks a lot in advance.

PC, 
This was one of the greatest upgrades that came out with Version 3.61e.
First create an hourly report with the variables you want.
After a simulation, click to view the detailed report.  
Click the Hourly Results button, voila, CSV is created.

Dear PC Thomas,

FYI...If you build your hourly report like you normally would (i.e. make an
hourly report block, assign desired variables to the block, assign the block
to an hourly report, etc.) then eQuest can very easily send all the data in
the report to a spreadsheet format by using the "File" --> "Export Hourly
Results" option within the main menu.  

This "Export Hourly Results" feature was a very nice upgrade that the eQuest
developers added in last year (I think) that really helps a lot since you
don't have to deal with importing text files into Excel anymore.  This
feature will even combine multiple hourly reports into a single spreadsheet
and properly label the variables so that you know what they are.  Before this
upgrade, hourly reports had no variable descriptions in the text file and
multiple reports simply appended to each other within the text file such that
it was difficult and tedious to figure out which data was what, move the data
to a spreadsheet, format, etc.  But, it could be done...Just very much easier
now.   Thanks eQuest developers!  :)

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Water-to-Water Heat Pumps
Message-ID: <906.9567.qm@web51502.mail.re2.yahoo.com>


We are having difficulty in configuring a
water-to-water heat pump in eQUEST and was wondering
if someone can throw some light on the best possible
method to model these systems. We are working on a
couple of projects where chilled and hot water is
produced by a geothermal heat-pump (water-water HP)
which then supply chilled and hot water to various VAV
air-handling units in the building. The only way it
can be done in eQUEST is to model as a loop-to-loop
heat pump but the drawbacks are 1) we cannot configure
the ground loop HX as the only heat exchanger it
accepts is a lake/well, and 2) it is difficult to
specify cooling and heating performance separately. We
also don?t the basis on which the performance curves
for the loop-to-loop chiller are derived to be able to
configure a new system. We have been using the
climatemaster tool for water-to-air heat-pumps which
have been working great, but have always run into
problems with the water-to-water configuration.

Any advice on a better way to model these systems as
they seem to be more common now-a-days? or point us to
any resource that will help us resolve this problem.

Thanks,
Gerald

PC-

After you have set up your hourly reports and run the simulation go to
"File/Export Hourly Results".  This should bring up a box that will allow
you to export your report to excel.  The spreadsheet file is also saved in
the same folder where your project lives.

Message-ID: <67825EE5BDA21746A7CA144993701F4E01489A8A@rgv-bos-073.rgv-nt.local>

Has anyone compared a VAV system against a chilled beam (CB) system for
a building located in the Northeastern US using eQuest?  I have modeled
an office building having a VAV system and then having a CB system and
have gotten some interesting results.  The CB is saving both cooling and
heating energy annually, but is being penalized by electric fan energy.
Might anyone have any input or experience that they could share with me?


 

FYI:  to simulate the chilled beam I am using an induction unit (2.46:1
induction ratio) with about 26% minimum outdoor air (there is return,
this is not a 100% OA system), separate CHW and HW loops for the chilled
beams.  

 

Thanks for your input.

The chilled beam is being modeled as a constant volume system and taking a
significant penalty because of this. The fan energy penalty may be real if
you have no mechanism to vary the volume (emphasizing the importance of
getting the system pressure drop down!) or a very annoying EQuest limitation
if you do intend a system with varying air flow rates. The main issue is
that the default induction diffuser system varies coil flow to control
capacity rather than airflow volume, so it does not have a calculation
methodology to reduce fan power during part load conditions.

The baseline VAV system is operating at a part load condition the majority
of the year. So, if it is operating at 60% design capacity, its fan is
turned down to about 35% design pressure drawing in the low 20% of design
power. Meanwhile, your chilled beam system is operating at 100% design power
all the time. If you design the chilled beam to low enough pressure drop and
take credit for the lower airflow volume, you can still show fan savings.
If you design it to 'standard' air handler and ducting pressure drops
without variable air flow volume, the model isn't lying - you've designed an
energy hog.

I currently work this problem with the standard 'Manually Calc Using Ugly
Hourly Outputs In Excel' approach. Someday I dream of pulling together a
User-Defined Default Expression for the fan pressure drop that would allow
me to adjust the fan pressure drop (and therefore the fan power) to a
fractional schedule directly in EQuest. Does anyone actually use those user
expressions, or are they there just to tempt with such 'if onlys' ?

Hello, has anyone used the refrigeration V3.61 in equest? I am having a
problem with getting the program to simulate it says
Error: COEF (1.00404477,-0.00405497, 0.00001017)
       FREEZING-T in Domestic Hot Water Loop has Expression Evaluation
       Error: Invalid BDL reference

Does anyone know how to fix this error. Also, it will not navigate to the
error so I know exactly what to fix. When I check the building description
it says no BDL errors, but when I simulate the building it says there is
an error. Any help will be very appreciated.


Thanks,
Chris McEvoy

I would like to know if anyone has modeled window-blinds or shades using
DOE2's WINDOW-LAYERS method in which a window-blind can be specified as
a layer in a window. Above that, a BLIND-SCHEDULE or a SLAT-SCHEDULE can
be specified and a trigger for ROOM-TEMPERATURE or SOLAR-INTENSITY can
be set to operate the blinds.
 
I would like to know about the capabilities and limitations of this
method in DOE2. Also could someone speak about the key differences
between DOE2's and Energy Plus's blinds model?
 
Thanks in advance!

Message-ID: <002e01c83e83$67251320$356f3960$@com>

 

I am attempting to model an energy recovery unit (ERU) supplying outside air
for 5 air handling units (AHUs).  I have attempted to do this thus far by
making the ERU a separate system PSZ with dumbo zone and the AHUs use ERU
for OA-FROM-SYSTEM.  

 

The problem lies within energy recovery capacities, the ERV report
capacities are nowhere near as high as the designed energy recovered so the
coiling coil is undersized and I am getting a lot of inadequate cooling
capability warnings.  The ERU has an additional gas furnace but no
additional cooling.

 

This is where I may be getting it mixed up because I set the
COOLING-SCHEDULE flagged to off for the entire year and I end up with no
energy recover on the cooling side.  Even if I were to change the ERU to
type PVAVS or SZRH it shows minimal or no recovery.  How should I schedule
cooling?

 

Are any other parameters that I may be missing, I have included the enthalpy
wheel effectiveness and a control sequence.  How about humidity controls?
Since this suppose to be a LEED certified building will ECMs be necessary?
Or should I go back to doing individual heat recovery for each AHU?  So many
questions.

The way I would do it is to use the OA-FROM-SYSTEM keyword and add the ERU
as a separate system with ventilation heat recovery.  In this way, you can
define the heat recovery and power and flow characteristics of the ERU
explicitly.  

 

I usually do this by first creating a very small (1 sq-ft) dummy space, then
a dummy thermal zone for that space.  Then, create the ERU as a 100% OA
constant volume system serving that thermal zone.  Now comes the fun part.
You close eQUEST, open the .inp with a text editor and cut the new system
and all its keywords from the bottom of the list of systems and paste it to
the top of the system list.  If you don't do this, when you run the
simulation, it will complain that the OA-FROM-SYSTEM system referenced does
not precede the current system and will abort the sim.  Now, reopen eQUEST
and in your 6 systems, use the OA-FROM-SYSTEM keyword on the system, OA tab
to define that the ventilation air is coming from your ERU.  

 

Hope this helps.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] add ceiling in eQUEST

 

Dear all,

When I model a one-floor building in eQUEST, I found that adding the "lay-in
acoustic tile" ceiling (no insulation added) will cause the peak load
through roof to zero. When eliminate the ceiling, a large part of the
building heat flow will go through the roof.

I also tried several buildings. When added ceiling, then the heat flow
through roof turns to zero. Does anyone have an idea why this happens? 

Thanks a lot.

David

Folks;
Whatever else maybe wrong or right with these approaches, eQ/DOE-2.2 cannot generally correctly model energy recovery in the OA-FROM-SYS.  This is because the exhaust/return air to the OA-FROM-SYS in a DOE-2 model is NOT from the occupied spaces, it is from the dummy/duct zone, which should never be at the room/return air conditions in either the model or reality. (It will usually be substantially cooler.) Too bad, because many real DOAS systems, (which would appear to be best represented with DOE-2's OA-FROM-SYS) include heat recovery and pre-conditioning.
 
Anyone know if any of the other "typical" simulation programs (TRACE, E+) represent a DOAS supplying zonal HVAC more correctly? Obviously one could model them in TRNSYS, and IES-VE.

P.S. I did actually once whip up a convoluted DOE-2.2 "workaround" for this arrangement. But I will not post it here because it really does not qualify as "simulation;" calling it a brittle kludge would be charitable.

Message-ID: <A6D2CA56F188534E9C3AA144D5305BDC03BF2524@pae-mail.pae.com>

Bldg Sim List,

 

I am getting a single BDL error when opening a model. It says,

 

" Cannot simulate LAYERS Layers 43 as given. The wall is  too thin or
too light. THICKNESS and/or DENSITY*SPECIFIC HEAT is too small. Use
U-VALUE CONSTRUCTION."

 

I see 'Layers 43' but it is not being used by any constructions. I have
tried to change the layers to various materials, which does nothing and
I've deleted it which gives more errors on open.

 

I am thinking that I will need to edit the inp file, possibly copy the
changes that I have made (which are substantial) to a new model. Is
there anything I should be looking for in the file either that will fix
the current model or that I should be sure to exclude from any
successive model.

 

Thanks

format that can be imported into a spreadsheet as columns of numbers.
Right now I can get it to print in the output file as text with page
breaks and headers, but that's no good for me.  I'm sure there is a
 way,
and I'm sure someone knows how to do it!  So thank you for your
response!

Best regards,
PC

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Under-Heated Hours for Zones with High Int. Loads
Message-ID: <7b7ed4a70712161843n69f4d586sc0f347bf4d1ecd5a@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm attempting to model a server room in Equest. The room has a high
equipment load (184 kW), and my problem is that for some reason I keep
getting underheated hours. Because this room is a core space in a basement
(with a huge EPD), there shouldn't even be a heating load associated. I've
played with the Reheat settings (using a 45 delta T) in the building model,
as well as just starting entirely new models (I even attempted to make a
simple "dummy" model with just one room and encountered the same problem,
only much worse).

If anyone has any suggestions as to why I'm having this problem they would
be much appreciated as I'm starting to tear out my hair.

Many Thanks,
Cassie

I've read the Bldg Sim DCV threads. For a LEED NC v2.1 submittal which
uses ECB method (not appendix G), could eQ v3.6 be used to show DCV
savings (for exceptional calculation method of ASHRAE 90.1-1999, chapter
11.5).

Is ASHRAE 90.1-1999, chapter 11.5 exceptional calculation method still
required to document DCV savings? This question is for a NC v2.1
submittal not v2.2.

Message-ID: <99A2815FF4D295488E034407278B16A401793BDF@sacexm01.nexant.corp>

Folks:
 
I have a building with several zones partially lit by skylights.  The
height from the floor to the roof is about 22'.  The spaces do have a
dropped ceiling at about 20', leaving an unconditioned plenum of about
2'.  There are small shafts allowing the light to penetrate into the
space below.
 
So the modeled zones have both spaces and plenums.  The roofs are child
components of the plenums and have skylights as child components of
them.
 
I have turned daylighting on and installed sensors at about 18' in the
applicable locations.
 
When I run the simulation, it gives an error, indicating that there must
be at least one window on the applicable space.  My guess is that
because there is a ceiling in the lower space, eQUEST cannot figure out
the light penetrates the ceiling below.
 
Interestingly enough, when skylights are created using the wizard,
eQUEST seems to create roofs on both the main space and the plenum.  The
skylit roof is part of the main space, and the other roof is part of the
plenum.  The roof over the plenum does not have skylights.
 
So the solution seems to be either to delete the ceiling (possibly
affecting the load) or create two roofs?
 
Thanks for any insights on this.

Hi,

Any comments or strategy tips for modeling a -10?F freezer warehouse using
eQuest-R?

I?ve done plenty of eQuest modeling, and plenty of refrigeration modeling
(using spreadsheets), but never tried to marry the two together.

 

Specifically, can you model:

1.	two-stage open-drive screw compressor system, with slide valve, or
VFD control?
2.	evaporator fan cycling?
3.	infiltration reductions by using better / faster freezer doors?
4.	underfloor frost-heave control system (using compressor jacket heat,
or otherwise)?
5.	hot gas defrost of evaporators (based on liquid run-time or on fixed
time schedule)?

 

Also, any comments on using eQuest to model the loads, and exporting the
hourly load reports to use in a separate spreadsheet model?

 

Any pointers or tips on the features and/or shortcomings of the
refrigeration version of eQuest to model the building described above will
be most appreciated.

Thanks

 we are planning to use EQUEST or TRACE 700 for energy simulation. 

 Is eQUEST an approved software by USGBC (in Texas)?

Where can we get training in DFW (Dallas Fort Worth) area?

 Which one is easier, faster? Trace 700 or eQUEST?

or do you know other simulation software (preferable free) that we can

Hello Ardas, hello to the Bldg-sim community. 

Short answer: Go with TRACE.

Longer response: 

Ardas, I'm afraid you have given me the opportunity I've been holding back
on, to give my two-cents on the "eQuest or not eQuest" question.  As you can
see below, that two-cents has ballooned into several thousand dollars of
thoughts (ha!) but I want to make sure I detail may answers in the hopes it
minimizes any offense taken to those who love eQuest.

I am an engineer working for a consulting firm in Philadelphia.  We have
been fortunate to land several large projects, of which some level of LEED
certification is being sought for each.  I have my LEED AP certification,
and have worked as an energy analyst and LEED professional on several
projects already.  Beyond my engineering background, I also worked for many
years in the IT industry, and have experience in programming and application
integration and development.  Therefore, I am the lucky guy in this office
who was chosen to lead the effort in becoming proficient in energy
simulation and modeling software.  We use different software packages
depending on what is best suited for project needs.  When we began this
endeavor, we heard about eQuest back when it was in its early 3.x series
versions, not as far back as some on this board I know but still far back
enough to appreciate newer developments in the program.  

I describe all of the above so that you know my opinion here comes from
practical experience and hands-on application of not only eQuest, but other
software packages.  With that said: 

Do not use eQuest. Go for TRACE, ENERGY 10, Carrier's HAP, or get into the
Revit vanguard, but if you are coming into the eQuest package cold, you will
find it to be frustrating, unreliable, and above all, lacking in any real
support structure in the event you have questions. 

To elaborate: 

1)There is NO REAL SUPPORT for eQuest users. None. I know creating and
maintaining an open board like Bldg-Sim is a time-consuming, often thankless
tasks, so right off the bat I want to make it clear to those that have
worked hard to make this forum, and probably have some emotional attachment
to it - I applaud your effort and continue to check the board often for new
discussion threads, of which I find several very interesting.  However, what
is often discussed and replied to on the Bldg-sim board has NOTHING to do
with questions regarding the operation of eQuest.  As an example, recently
there was a lively thread regarding the application of ASHRAE's 90.1 Appdx G
rule, which requires the budget building model to rotate and average its
simulated energy performance.  Great discussion to all those involved, I
feel I learned a lot thru the back-and-forth.  However, that discussion had
nothing, or very little, to do with eQuest.  
eQuest has it's origins as a text-only, line-command programming code, and
the graphic user interface (GUI)you see and use is an attempt to simplify
using the code's simulation engine, to reach a wider audience of engineers
who were not proficient in direct coding.  In order to make the graphic
interface manageable, however, the developers had to make choices as to what
code aspects the graphic input screens would first be connected to, and what
would have to wait for later updates.  Ultimately, I think it will be
impossible to give the GUI the complete capabilities as direct coding. That
means if you needed to do something with a system sim that was not
represented in the GUI, you must go to the code directly - a daunting task
even for someone with coding experience, let alone and engineer who has no
background in it.  

Since eQuest is a freeware product (or is the proper term shareware? Not
sure...), it was attractive to engineers who did not want to spend a lot up
front to do simulations, and soon the "buzzword" of the eQuest name got
around, and owner reps and other non-tech entities began asking if their
engineers were using eQuest, we must validate with eQuest, how's that eQuest
model coming along, etc.  Of course firms wanted to get on the bandwagon,
and be able to say "sure, we use eQuest" to win projects. However, what that
left the engineer with was a freeware product that was very detailed even
with its GUI, required a large learning curve, and, since you didn't pay
anything for it, had no support line or real support structure to it.  Even
to this day, I am unaware of any bona-fide support resource.  What made
matters worse was that eQuest was constantly being updated, even the help
files.  Often you would go to a specific topic in the help file, only to
find "Under Construction" as the answer! I've been told that "question
packs" would be available, as in you could pay $400 or so for a set amount
of tech issues, but I am unaware if this has actually gotten off the ground.


When you purchase TRACE or any of the other retail packages, the upfront
cost is required I know, but you have then bought into a real support
structure where you can email or call with questions or problems with
simulation.  I can't stress how important that is.  When you get knee deep
in a building model for a multi-million dollar project, and get snagged on
some techie bug with outputs or software gliches, trust me you don't want
your only means of support to be a discussion forum, you want to call a
software support tech who is being paid to assist you. 

I have other points to this, but the email is getting long in the tooth.
The other points I will make brief and wait for any response: 

2)eQuest operation is frustrating.  If you have a model that can stay within
the Design Wizard mode, most inputs and code-related data is automatically
entered for you, and the sim run smoothly.  However, I have never had a
model which I could fully run in Wiz mode, always having to access the
Detailed Date Edit mode and go bit by bit thru all the inputs.  Very
frustrating.  Also, there are several inputs which are difficult to
understand, and, coupled with the lack of help file sections, become
mysteries.  And lack of user interface features becomes a pain.  For
example, eQuest offers a table-style list of data inputs for anything from
window data to air handler data, but you cannot do group edits easily such
as select a similar column of cells and change all values at once.
Simulation processing times can be long, and there is no option which
minimizes what is simulated.  Carrier's HAP program for example allows you
to pick and choose what reports are generated, and what simulations are
performed. eQuest just has one large output file with ten thousand pages.
Maybe there is someone out there who knows some shortcuts to these specific
problems - but that gets back to the support issue - I am now relying on
someone to take the time to explain things to me, and for my time on this
board I have seen many, many question go unanswered.

3)eQuest reports are unreliable.  This may be due to the extensive detailed
inputs that are required for most system comparisons, but the result remains
the same - often eQuest reports (generated thru the DDE mode) come back with
crazy values and conclusions, which are difficult to analyze.  I've also ran
the same report several times on a model that had no modifications applied,
and the results have come back differently. This may be a factor of eQuest's
continuous updates and bug fixes, but again, if you are responsible for
analyzing a multi-million dollar building for LEED's EAcr1-10, you don't
want to be staying up all night trying to decipher cryptic report results. 

I know eQuest has a lot of potential, and I have had some limited success in
running simple models.  The unfortunate reality is most models are not
simple, and when you enter into the "gaming" of what-ifs to see how
insulation levels affect performance, what would ice storage be like vs.
chilled water, how does daylight econ impact light loads, water-cooled
compressors on DX units and apply water-side economization, etc etc, then it
doesn't help if you've "heard" eQuest can do all these things, and have no
recourse to find out how it can be operated to do so.  The reality is there
are other very good, very capable simulation packages out there, that may
not have all the detail as eQuest, but at least can return valid results and
support their user base more effectively. 

I think in the final analysis, that the hype of eQuest's purported
capabilities has outpaced the practical reality of its true capabilities,
and we as engineers are stuck trying to connect the open ends.

Hope this helps,

Introduction of skylights must also be accompanied by a corresponding reduction in Lighting Power Densities. 
  How you figure that out is dependent on how you do your Daylighting and Lighting simulation. Daysim does propose LPDs based on your daylighting design and that might be of help.
   
  Would anyone  suggest a better method/simulation software, especially if you have done a skylight simulation w.r.t. energy consumption.
   
  Thanks,

Hello Ardas, hello to the Bldg-sim community. 

Short answer: Go with TRACE.

Longer response: 

Ardas, I'm afraid you have given me the opportunity I've been holding
back
on, to give my two-cents on the "eQuest or not eQuest" question.  As you
can
see below, that two-cents has ballooned into several thousand dollars of
thoughts (ha!) but I want to make sure I detail may answers in the hopes
it
minimizes any offense taken to those who love eQuest.

I am an engineer working for a consulting firm in Philadelphia.  We have
been fortunate to land several large projects, of which some level of
LEED
certification is being sought for each.  I have my LEED AP
certification,
and have worked as an energy analyst and LEED professional on several
projects already.  Beyond my engineering background, I also worked for
many
years in the IT industry, and have experience in programming and
application
integration and development.  Therefore, I am the lucky guy in this
office
who was chosen to lead the effort in becoming proficient in energy
simulation and modeling software.  We use different software packages
depending on what is best suited for project needs.  When we began this
endeavor, we heard about eQuest back when it was in its early 3.x series
versions, not as far back as some on this board I know but still far
back
enough to appreciate newer developments in the program.  

I describe all of the above so that you know my opinion here comes from
practical experience and hands-on application of not only eQuest, but
other
software packages.  With that said: 

Do not use eQuest. Go for TRACE, ENERGY 10, Carrier's HAP, or get into
the
Revit vanguard, but if you are coming into the eQuest package cold, you
will
find it to be frustrating, unreliable, and above all, lacking in any
real
support structure in the event you have questions. 

To elaborate: 

1)There is NO REAL SUPPORT for eQuest users. None. I know creating and
maintaining an open board like Bldg-Sim is a time-consuming, often
thankless
tasks, so right off the bat I want to make it clear to those that have
worked hard to make this forum, and probably have some emotional
attachment
to it - I applaud your effort and continue to check the board often for
new
discussion threads, of which I find several very interesting.  However,
what
is often discussed and replied to on the Bldg-sim board has NOTHING to
do
with questions regarding the operation of eQuest.  As an example,
recently
there was a lively thread regarding the application of ASHRAE's 90.1
Appdx G
rule, which requires the budget building model to rotate and average its
simulated energy performance.  Great discussion to all those involved, I
feel I learned a lot thru the back-and-forth.  However, that discussion
had
nothing, or very little, to do with eQuest.  
eQuest has it's origins as a text-only, line-command programming code,
and
the graphic user interface (GUI)you see and use is an attempt to
simplify
using the code's simulation engine, to reach a wider audience of
engineers
who were not proficient in direct coding.  In order to make the graphic
interface manageable, however, the developers had to make choices as to
what
code aspects the graphic input screens would first be connected to, and
what
would have to wait for later updates.  Ultimately, I think it will be
impossible to give the GUI the complete capabilities as direct coding.
That
means if you needed to do something with a system sim that was not
represented in the GUI, you must go to the code directly - a daunting
task
even for someone with coding experience, let alone and engineer who has
no
background in it.  

Since eQuest is a freeware product (or is the proper term shareware? Not
sure...), it was attractive to engineers who did not want to spend a lot
up
front to do simulations, and soon the "buzzword" of the eQuest name got
around, and owner reps and other non-tech entities began asking if their
engineers were using eQuest, we must validate with eQuest, how's that
eQuest
model coming along, etc.  Of course firms wanted to get on the
bandwagon,
and be able to say "sure, we use eQuest" to win projects. However, what
that
left the engineer with was a freeware product that was very detailed
even
with its GUI, required a large learning curve, and, since you didn't pay
anything for it, had no support line or real support structure to it.
Even
to this day, I am unaware of any bona-fide support resource.  What made
matters worse was that eQuest was constantly being updated, even the
help
files.  Often you would go to a specific topic in the help file, only to
find "Under Construction" as the answer! I've been told that "question
packs" would be available, as in you could pay $400 or so for a set
amount
of tech issues, but I am unaware if this has actually gotten off the
ground.


When you purchase TRACE or any of the other retail packages, the upfront
cost is required I know, but you have then bought into a real support
structure where you can email or call with questions or problems with
simulation.  I can't stress how important that is.  When you get knee
deep
in a building model for a multi-million dollar project, and get snagged
on
some techie bug with outputs or software gliches, trust me you don't
want
your only means of support to be a discussion forum, you want to call a
software support tech who is being paid to assist you. 

I have other points to this, but the email is getting long in the tooth.
The other points I will make brief and wait for any response: 

2)eQuest operation is frustrating.  If you have a model that can stay
within
the Design Wizard mode, most inputs and code-related data is
automatically
entered for you, and the sim run smoothly.  However, I have never had a
model which I could fully run in Wiz mode, always having to access the
Detailed Date Edit mode and go bit by bit thru all the inputs.  Very
frustrating.  Also, there are several inputs which are difficult to
understand, and, coupled with the lack of help file sections, become
mysteries.  And lack of user interface features becomes a pain.  For
example, eQuest offers a table-style list of data inputs for anything
from
window data to air handler data, but you cannot do group edits easily
such
as select a similar column of cells and change all values at once.
Simulation processing times can be long, and there is no option which
minimizes what is simulated.  Carrier's HAP program for example allows
you
to pick and choose what reports are generated, and what simulations are
performed. eQuest just has one large output file with ten thousand
pages.
Maybe there is someone out there who knows some shortcuts to these
specific
problems - but that gets back to the support issue - I am now relying on
someone to take the time to explain things to me, and for my time on
this
board I have seen many, many question go unanswered.

3)eQuest reports are unreliable.  This may be due to the extensive
detailed
inputs that are required for most system comparisons, but the result
remains
the same - often eQuest reports (generated thru the DDE mode) come back
with
crazy values and conclusions, which are difficult to analyze.  I've also
ran
the same report several times on a model that had no modifications
applied,
and the results have come back differently. This may be a factor of
eQuest's
continuous updates and bug fixes, but again, if you are responsible for
analyzing a multi-million dollar building for LEED's EAcr1-10, you don't
want to be staying up all night trying to decipher cryptic report
results. 

I know eQuest has a lot of potential, and I have had some limited
success in
running simple models.  The unfortunate reality is most models are not
simple, and when you enter into the "gaming" of what-ifs to see how
insulation levels affect performance, what would ice storage be like vs.
chilled water, how does daylight econ impact light loads, water-cooled
compressors on DX units and apply water-side economization, etc etc,
then it
doesn't help if you've "heard" eQuest can do all these things, and have
no
recourse to find out how it can be operated to do so.  The reality is
there
are other very good, very capable simulation packages out there, that
may
not have all the detail as eQuest, but at least can return valid results
and
support their user base more effectively. 

I think in the final analysis, that the hype of eQuest's purported
capabilities has outpaced the practical reality of its true
capabilities,
and we as engineers are stuck trying to connect the open ends.

Hope this helps,

Hi All,

I too have spent many frustrating nights trying to figure out what is wrong
with my eQuest models.  After all the brow-beating, I have always come to
the conclusion that something was wrong with my inputs, not with the
software, and been able to remedy the issue.  Not true for Trace700.  I
spent about a year with Trace, found a number of bugs (some of which the
company is now fixing), got frustrated with the long (hour-plus) simulation
times, and limitation to modeling 4 alternatives in one file.  Yes it's nice
that there's someone to call when you have questions, but they don't always
know the answer.  I had people telling me to check my fan energy inputs when
the odd data I was getting had nothing to do with fans.

In addition, I often have trouble with data corruption when editing
templates.  Granted, templates are a great idea and I wish eQuest had a
similar option, but when your inputs are corrupted and you have to go
through and check room by room to see what remains...  not a fun process.

Trace700 has no visual feedback for window, wall, room or roof geometry.
This can be a pain.

I also believe that their water source heat-pump system does not share
energy in the loop properly.  I created a test-file, consisting of two
10X10X10 rooms.  One room had a large cooling load, the other a large
heating mode.  Neither had any external surface areas.  The total energy
required to condition the spaces should have been much lower for heat pumps
than for fain coils... but, they were practically identical.  I sent the
model to Trace, and they argued that this was not a fair test of their
software????

So... though eQuest can be frustrating at times, I gladly use it over Trace.

~Karen~

Now this is the beginning of a very useful thread!

Steve Playo pointed out some important things to consider in choosing an
energy simulation program.  I also agree with Karen Walkerman in her defense
of eQUEST.  I, too, would use it in preference to TRACE in most cases.

What too many people do not realize is energy simulation is a very
complicated and detailed process.  Far too many assume the eQUEST wizard or
the TRACE entry method will allow them to simulate a building for LEED or
whatever without going through the agony of learning what the building is
doing or how the program models it.  It just isn't going to happen.

I have been doing energy simulation for 30 years.  I started with Cal-ERDA
1.3 (predecessor to DOE-2.2, the eQUEST calculation engine) on a time shared
main frame computer.  After a couple years of expensive time sharing, I
helped my employer install DOE-2.1 on a DEC System 10 main frame.  In 1986,
I left that employer to do energy simulation for my own company.  Over the
years, I have used DOE, TRACE, BLAST, and a number of other simulation
programs.  I have taken training courses in most of the ones I have used and
assisted in training courses for eQUEST.  The point is that even now, I
learn something new on every project.  I used to say that running DOE took
the equivalent of a five hour college course.  Now, I think it is the
equivalent of a college degree.

Don't worry about how cheap the program is to obtain.  Whatever it costs
will pale compared to the cost of learning how to use it.  Take the training
for whatever program you are going to use and then expect to spend a lot
more time on the learning curve.

This is not to discourage using energy simulation.  Energy simulation is a
wonderful tool.  It is easy to come up with more than enough energy and
dollar savings to offset the additional engineering hours.  And it will only
become more important in the future.  It's just not as easy as some people
would like to think.

Mike Roberts

a pain.  For example, eQuest offers a table-style list of data inputs
for anything from window data to air handler data, but you cannot do
group edits easily such as select a similar column of cells and change
all values at once.
Simulation processing times can be long, and there is no option which
minimizes what is simulated.  Carrier's HAP program for example allows
you to pick and choose what reports are generated, and what simulations
are performed. eQuest just has one large output file with ten thousand
pages.
Maybe there is someone out there who knows some shortcuts to these
specific problems - but that gets back to the support issue - I am now
relying on someone to take the time to explain things to me, and for my
time on this board I have seen many, many question go unanswered.

3)eQuest reports are unreliable.  This may be due to the extensive
detailed inputs that are required for most system comparisons, but the
result remains the same - often eQuest reports (generated thru the DDE
mode) come back with crazy values and conclusions, which are difficult
to analyze.  I've also ran the same report several times on a model that
had no modifications applied, and the results have come back
differently. This may be a factor of eQuest's continuous updates and bug
fixes, but again, if you are responsible for analyzing a multi-million
dollar building for LEED's EAcr1-10, you don't want to be staying up all
night trying to decipher cryptic report results. 

I know eQuest has a lot of potential, and I have had some limited
success in running simple models.  The unfortunate reality is most
models are not simple, and when you enter into the "gaming" of what-ifs
to see how insulation levels affect performance, what would ice storage
be like vs.
chilled water, how does daylight econ impact light loads, water-cooled
compressors on DX units and apply water-side economization, etc etc,
then it doesn't help if you've "heard" eQuest can do all these things,
and have no recourse to find out how it can be operated to do so.  The
reality is there are other very good, very capable simulation packages
out there, that may not have all the detail as eQuest, but at least can
return valid results and support their user base more effectively. 

I think in the final analysis, that the hype of eQuest's purported
capabilities has outpaced the practical reality of its true
capabilities, and we as engineers are stuck trying to connect the open
ends.

Hope this helps,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] simulation software

hi,

 we are planning to use EQUEST or TRACE 700 for energy simulation. 

 Is eQUEST an approved software by USGBC (in Texas)?

Where can we get training in DFW (Dallas Fort Worth) area?

 Which one is easier, faster? Trace 700 or eQUEST?

or do you know other simulation software (preferable free) that we can
utilize in our LEED design projects and we can get training in DFW area?

thanks

Ardas

Hi All,

I agree with Mike Roberts.  I started my career 34 years ago as a sales
engineer for the Trane Company.  One of my responsibilities was to teach
consulting engineers how to use TRACE.  This was before the advent of time
sharing on mainframes when a completed input book was mailed to La Crosse,
Wisconsin for a two week turnaround.

I became an Energy Consultant in 1979 and used TRACE extensively for many
years in both new construction and the energy retrofit business. With the
migration of TRACE and DOE-2 from running on time shared mainframes to
running on the PC, the simulation world has really changed our business.
Some runs used to take 24 hours to process on the first PC versions.  I
incurred $20,000 in run time costs on a large project using time sharing on
a mainframe. Now, if software costs $1,700 to purchase with an annual $300
maintenance fee we think that it's cost prohibitive.  When a simulation
program takes three minutes to make a run we start looking at our watches.

In 1981 I learned how to read and write the Building Description Language
(BDL) and input DOE2.1E the hard way by coding everything by hand (sometimes
in Cartesian coordinates) and running it on a time shared mainframe.  I ran
many DOE2.1E simulations using time sharing and then using Micro-DOE2 on an
IBM 386 PC in the early 90's.  DOE-2 is a great program and provides the
knowledgeable user with just about any kind of hourly output you would like
to analyze.

In the last number of years I have used both TRACE 700 and eQUEST.  I like
using both programs depending on what I am trying to model.  If you are
going to run eQUEST you had better plan on experiencing a steep learning
curve so you can tweak the BDL as required instead of relying on the Wizards
for your input and output flexibility.  The CAD import feature of eQUEST is
a great tool.

I have received excellent technical support from TRACE CDS over the years
and very little technical support on DOE-2.  The quality of the technical
support received depends many times on how you phrase your questions and
whether or not you really understand what you are trying to accomplish.

For the last 17 years I have specialized in conducting facility assessments,
modeling new and existing building systems, preparing retrofit designs of
chiller plants, steam and hot water boiler plants, air systems, pumping
systems, direct digital controls systems and then providing "hands-on"
commissioning of the building's Direct Digital Control systems to ensure the
projects work.

Building system modeling is going to be "garbage in - garbage out" if you
expect pre-processing and post-processing software to do all the "heavy
lifting" for you. To be an effective modeler one has to develop a thorough
understanding of how HVAC systems work and how to design these systems that
are being modeled.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] simulation software

Now this is the beginning of a very useful thread!

Steve Playo pointed out some important things to consider in choosing an
energy simulation program.  I also agree with Karen Walkerman in her defense
of eQUEST.  I, too, would use it in preference to TRACE in most cases.

What too many people do not realize is energy simulation is a very
complicated and detailed process.  Far too many assume the eQUEST wizard or
the TRACE entry method will allow them to simulate a building for LEED or
whatever without going through the agony of learning what the building is
doing or how the program models it.  It just isn't going to happen.

I have been doing energy simulation for 30 years.  I started with Cal-ERDA
1.3 (predecessor to DOE-2.2, the eQUEST calculation engine) on a time shared
main frame computer.  After a couple years of expensive time sharing, I
helped my employer install DOE-2.1 on a DEC System 10 main frame.  In 1986,
I left that employer to do energy simulation for my own company.  Over the
years, I have used DOE, TRACE, BLAST, and a number of other simulation
programs.  I have taken training courses in most of the ones I have used and
assisted in training courses for eQUEST.  The point is that even now, I
learn something new on every project.  I used to say that running DOE took
the equivalent of a five hour college course.  Now, I think it is the
equivalent of a college degree.

Don't worry about how cheap the program is to obtain.  Whatever it costs
will pale compared to the cost of learning how to use it.  Take the training
for whatever program you are going to use and then expect to spend a lot
more time on the learning curve.

This is not to discourage using energy simulation.  Energy simulation is a
wonderful tool.  It is easy to come up with more than enough energy and
dollar savings to offset the additional engineering hours.  And it will only
become more important in the future.  It's just not as easy as some people
would like to think.

Mike Roberts

Hi All,

I too have spent many frustrating nights trying to figure out what is wrong
with my eQuest models.  After all the brow-beating, I have always come to
the conclusion that something was wrong with my inputs, not with the
software, and been able to remedy the issue.  Not true for Trace700.  I
spent about a year with Trace, found a number of bugs (some of which the
company is now fixing), got frustrated with the long (hour-plus) simulation
times, and limitation to modeling 4 alternatives in one file.  Yes it's nice
that there's someone to call when you have questions, but they don't always
know the answer.  I had people telling me to check my fan energy inputs when
the odd data I was getting had nothing to do with fans.

In addition, I often have trouble with data corruption when editing
templates.  Granted, templates are a great idea and I wish eQuest had a
similar option, but when your inputs are corrupted and you have to go
through and check room by room to see what remains...  not a fun process.

Trace700 has no visual feedback for window, wall, room or roof geometry.
This can be a pain.

I also believe that their water source heat-pump system does not share
energy in the loop properly.  I created a test-file, consisting of two
10X10X10 rooms.  One room had a large cooling load, the other a large
heating mode.  Neither had any external surface areas.  The total energy
required to condition the spaces should have been much lower for heat pumps
than for fain coils... but, they were practically identical.  I sent the
model to Trace, and they argued that this was not a fair test of their
software????

So... though eQuest can be frustrating at times, I gladly use it over Trace.

~Karen~

Hi all

Does anyone know of any upcoming eQUEST courses, I have recently started
using eQUEST and think I could now benefit from an actual course rather
than self learning.

Thanks in advance.

I don't believe you can Parametrically. You would need to copy the file
into EEM Run 1, then change the zoning.

Would be a nice feature to have.

This is truly an interesting topic and I'll add my $0.02.

I know very little of TRACE.  I'm relatively inexperienced in simulation
compared to some folks in our midst.  I started using EnergyPlus 2.5 years
ago and I've since used DOE2.2 and eQuest a fair amount.  Personally, I like
eQuest, but if anybody wants a job done right, it's going to demand an
understanding of BDL.  Yes, the output from DOE2 is confusing.  But just
because you get simple answers from a tool doesn't mean they are right
answers.  Personally, I'd suggest using eQuest as a front end and learning
DOE2 BDL.  I guess I have a somewhat unique perspective among the younger
crowd of modelers because I started out writing my input files by hand, just
like the older guys did back in the 70s and 80s (or earlier?!)  But it's
critical that you understand what's going on behind the scenes if you really
want to get consistent higher quality results.

The fundamental problem here is one of the users judgment.  Nothing
demonstrates garbage-in, garbage-out like an easy-to-use energy simulation
tool.  Just because you hire a firm with lots of energy simulation
experience doesn't mean you're going to get high quality simulation
results.  You're going to get access to the engineering judgment of people
at that firm, which is worth a lot because they're going to be better at
smelling garbage.  But I don't believe you can really trust any big firm to
tell you with certainty whether a given building design uses 27% or 32% less
energy than a baseline building.  You could certainly trust the results more
if you hired one of these experienced DOE2 experts to do the modeling
themselves, but it's likely that their billing rates are too high and the
lower bid will come from the firm who is using younger, less experienced
modelers and using the more experienced people for oversight and
management.  That's just how it goes.

It's amazing how many projects choose a top-flight architecture firm and
then go after commodity engineering and energy expertise, especially when
the architects tout the energy efficiency of the buildings.  They drop $10
million on architectural features and then choose their energy consultant
based on a $10 thousand difference in bids.  It's embarassing how many
LEED-certified pieces of garbage are out there.

But where can we go with this energy simulation problem?  A big problem with
these projects is that they are more likely to use new technologies that
aren't simple to model and haven't yet seen enough use in simulation engines
to really work all of the bugs out.  I cringe every time I use the GSHP
model in any model.  So what can you do, except get deeper into the code?
Pretty soon you'll be reading FORTRAN, a step I've never taken, but come
quite close to taking.

Personally, I think there are way too many assumptions that may be
questionable in our modeling to be sure about absolute energy usage.  But
this isn't necessarily that important, really.  It seems that what we want
to be sure about is the relative difference in savings between a base case
and a case including a given measure.  Where we really need tool or process
improvement is in garbage sniffing.  I've been using DView with hourly
output for debugging purposes for a while.  It's a tremendous help in
ferreting out problems in your models.  But it seems we could get more
advanced in this sort of capability.  Just like you check the geometry in
eQuest, you should check the building operation to make sure it makes sense
-- do you see the lights coming on as scheduled?  Do you see the HVAC system
cycling on and off and behaving as it should?  Does that ice storage system
load when it's supposed to load and unload when it's supposed to?

While it might be difficult to calibrate an individual model of a new
building, we need calibration methods for making sure that a given
technology is performing as it should.  If this isn't possible, we should be
completely clear and candid with our clients and tell them this.  You're
misleading yourself if you think an uncalibrated hourly model in eQuest is
more accurate in depicting the performance of a novel system than an
uncalibrated Excel model is.  And calibration methods for these things....
These need to be standardized and improved.

In the long run, I think the models with the most resources behind them are
going to be the ones to use.  This probably means EnergyPlus, as soon as it
starts to acquire more users, provided that funding continues.

I'm not sure how the real pros in the industry can distinguish themselves
from more commodity type energy consultants going forward.  Maybe
performance contracting is the answer?  What if you hired a single firm as
designer, energy consultant, commissioner, and ESCO going forward?  That
would certainly provide the right kind of incentive.

Maybe LEED certification should require an independent audit and
recommissioning at the 2 year mark to determine what the real energy usage
should be?

There's just a lot out there, process-wise, that we can work as a community
to improve.  As fast as the industry is growing, there's the potential for
quality to go downhill and genuine simulation experts find themselves being
outbid by groups that do shoddy work.

Back to the task at hand, learn eQuest and learn BDL if you really want to
do high quality work.  Also be sure to practice looking at hourly output and
using your engineering judgment to verify that things are operating as
expected.  My experience is that there are guaranteed to be bugs in your
work -- you just need to develop a keen nose for sniffing them out.

OK, Ardas:

It is 12:30 AM, I am still resolving LEED questions on my model, so it
is time to respond.

Since everyone is telling their tale, I will tell you mine.

I began in the energy industry in 1977, after getting an Aeronautical
Engineering Degree and working on the B1-A bomber in Flight test for 5+
years. This obviously qualifies me to do energy modeling (????)

I switched industries, just about the Iran Hostage Crisis (the "Second"
Energy crisis - Lord, gas went up to $0.75/gallon !!). I began working
for my Dad, who was Hilton Hotels and the American Hotel and Motel
Association's Energy guy. I began using the REAL first guru in hourly
energy analysis programs, Ross Meriwether (ASHRAE FELLOW)ESAS program.
It ran on an IBM 370-65 at Trinity University in San Antonio, TX. And we
performed analysis on the Waldorf-Astoria, the Las Vegas Hilton and Las
Vegas Flamingo Hilton, the San Francisco Hilton, and the Hilton Hawaiian
Village in Honolulu, HI.

And I gained weight from the good food.

I switched to DOE-2.1A in 1984, as Ross' program became expensive to run
($1,500/run). I am still indebted to this man, who really taught me what
hourly energy analysis was all about.

I have run DOE-2.1A, B, C, D, E, and now eQuest. I have also run Trace
600 and HAP 3.1.

I have always had respect for TRACE and HAP, as they seem to capsulate
the Design aspect and HVAC coil/fan parameters the best.

However, I am in the energy analysis game, so prefer eQuest. As does
Southern California Edison, pacific Gas and Electric, Rocky Mountain
Power in Utah, and Consolidated Edison and NYSERDA in New York state.

I considered Jeff Hirsch, Marlin Addison, Steve Gates, and Scott
Criswell (all of DOE2 fame) as my friends and colleagues. They have
ALWAYS responded to my queries on eQuest (example
marlin.addison at doe2.com). 

As was stated by several people, one can now actually see the building
as input into eQuest, which the United States Green Building Council
(USGBC) absolutely LOVES.

I have taken 5 Basic courses and two Intermediate course from marlin
Addison, DOE-2 training specialist, and Professor at the Arizona State
University in Phoenix, AZ. Once I finally got the POLYGON concept down,
the rest of eQuest was easy.

But this particular forum is also great for areas that some of us NEVER
cover.

Does TRACE have a similar online forum????? Lord, this is supposed to be
an Energy Plus forum !! And 95% of the traffic is eQUEST RELATED.

What does that tell YOU ??????????????????

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] simulation software

Hello Ardas, hello to the Bldg-sim community. 

Short answer: Go with TRACE.

Longer response: 

Ardas, I'm afraid you have given me the opportunity I've been holding
back on, to give my two-cents on the "eQuest or not eQuest" question.
As you can see below, that two-cents has ballooned into several thousand
dollars of thoughts (ha!) but I want to make sure I detail may answers
in the hopes it minimizes any offense taken to those who love eQuest.

I am an engineer working for a consulting firm in Philadelphia.  We have
been fortunate to land several large projects, of which some level of
LEED certification is being sought for each.  I have my LEED AP
certification, and have worked as an energy analyst and LEED
professional on several projects already.  Beyond my engineering
background, I also worked for many years in the IT industry, and have
experience in programming and application integration and development.
Therefore, I am the lucky guy in this office who was chosen to lead the
effort in becoming proficient in energy simulation and modeling
software.  We use different software packages depending on what is best
suited for project needs.  When we began this endeavor, we heard about
eQuest back when it was in its early 3.x series versions, not as far
back as some on this board I know but still far back enough to
appreciate newer developments in the program.  

I describe all of the above so that you know my opinion here comes from
practical experience and hands-on application of not only eQuest, but
other software packages.  With that said: 

Do not use eQuest. Go for TRACE, ENERGY 10, Carrier's HAP, or get into
the Revit vanguard, but if you are coming into the eQuest package cold,
you will find it to be frustrating, unreliable, and above all, lacking
in any real support structure in the event you have questions. 

To elaborate: 

1)There is NO REAL SUPPORT for eQuest users. None. I know creating and
maintaining an open board like Bldg-Sim is a time-consuming, often
thankless tasks, so right off the bat I want to make it clear to those
that have worked hard to make this forum, and probably have some
emotional attachment to it - I applaud your effort and continue to check
the board often for new discussion threads, of which I find several very
interesting.  However, what is often discussed and replied to on the
Bldg-sim board has NOTHING to do with questions regarding the operation
of eQuest.  As an example, recently there was a lively thread regarding
the application of ASHRAE's 90.1 Appdx G rule, which requires the budget
building model to rotate and average its simulated energy performance.
Great discussion to all those involved, I feel I learned a lot thru the
back-and-forth.  However, that discussion had nothing, or very little,
to do with eQuest.  
eQuest has it's origins as a text-only, line-command programming code,
and the graphic user interface (GUI)you see and use is an attempt to
simplify using the code's simulation engine, to reach a wider audience
of engineers who were not proficient in direct coding.  In order to make
the graphic interface manageable, however, the developers had to make
choices as to what code aspects the graphic input screens would first be
connected to, and what would have to wait for later updates.
Ultimately, I think it will be impossible to give the GUI the complete
capabilities as direct coding. That means if you needed to do something
with a system sim that was not represented in the GUI, you must go to
the code directly - a daunting task even for someone with coding
experience, let alone and engineer who has no background in it.  

Since eQuest is a freeware product (or is the proper term shareware? Not
sure...), it was attractive to engineers who did not want to spend a lot
up front to do simulations, and soon the "buzzword" of the eQuest name
got around, and owner reps and other non-tech entities began asking if
their engineers were using eQuest, we must validate with eQuest, how's
that eQuest model coming along, etc.  Of course firms wanted to get on
the bandwagon, and be able to say "sure, we use eQuest" to win projects.
However, what that left the engineer with was a freeware product that
was very detailed even with its GUI, required a large learning curve,
and, since you didn't pay anything for it, had no support line or real
support structure to it.  Even to this day, I am unaware of any
bona-fide support resource.  What made matters worse was that eQuest was
constantly being updated, even the help files.  Often you would go to a
specific topic in the help file, only to find "Under Construction" as
the answer! I've been told that "question packs" would be available, as
in you could pay $400 or so for a set amount of tech issues, but I am
unaware if this has actually gotten off the ground.


When you purchase TRACE or any of the other retail packages, the upfront
cost is required I know, but you have then bought into a real support
structure where you can email or call with questions or problems with
simulation.  I can't stress how important that is.  When you get knee
deep in a building model for a multi-million dollar project, and get
snagged on some techie bug with outputs or software gliches, trust me
you don't want your only means of support to be a discussion forum, you
want to call a software support tech who is being paid to assist you. 

I have other points to this, but the email is getting long in the tooth.
The other points I will make brief and wait for any response: 

2)eQuest operation is frustrating.  If you have a model that can stay
within the Design Wizard mode, most inputs and code-related data is
automatically entered for you, and the sim run smoothly.  However, I
have never had a model which I could fully run in Wiz mode, always
having to access the Detailed Date Edit mode and go bit by bit thru all
the inputs.  Very frustrating.  Also, there are several inputs which are
difficult to understand, and, coupled with the lack of help file
sections, become mysteries.  And lack of user interface features becomes
a pain.  For example, eQuest offers a table-style list of data inputs
for anything from window data to air handler data, but you cannot do
group edits easily such as select a similar column of cells and change
all values at once.
Simulation processing times can be long, and there is no option which
minimizes what is simulated.  Carrier's HAP program for example allows
you to pick and choose what reports are generated, and what simulations
are performed. eQuest just has one large output file with ten thousand
pages.
Maybe there is someone out there who knows some shortcuts to these
specific problems - but that gets back to the support issue - I am now
relying on someone to take the time to explain things to me, and for my
time on this board I have seen many, many question go unanswered.

3)eQuest reports are unreliable.  This may be due to the extensive
detailed inputs that are required for most system comparisons, but the
result remains the same - often eQuest reports (generated thru the DDE
mode) come back with crazy values and conclusions, which are difficult
to analyze.  I've also ran the same report several times on a model that
had no modifications applied, and the results have come back
differently. This may be a factor of eQuest's continuous updates and bug
fixes, but again, if you are responsible for analyzing a multi-million
dollar building for LEED's EAcr1-10, you don't want to be staying up all
night trying to decipher cryptic report results. 

I know eQuest has a lot of potential, and I have had some limited
success in running simple models.  The unfortunate reality is most
models are not simple, and when you enter into the "gaming" of what-ifs
to see how insulation levels affect performance, what would ice storage
be like vs.
chilled water, how does daylight econ impact light loads, water-cooled
compressors on DX units and apply water-side economization, etc etc,
then it doesn't help if you've "heard" eQuest can do all these things,
and have no recourse to find out how it can be operated to do so.  The
reality is there are other very good, very capable simulation packages
out there, that may not have all the detail as eQuest, but at least can
return valid results and support their user base more effectively. 

I think in the final analysis, that the hype of eQuest's purported
capabilities has outpaced the practical reality of its true
capabilities, and we as engineers are stuck trying to connect the open
ends.

Hope this helps,

hi,

 we are planning to use EQUEST or TRACE 700 for energy simulation. 

 Is eQUEST an approved software by USGBC (in Texas)?

Where can we get training in DFW (Dallas Fort Worth) area?

 Which one is easier, faster? Trace 700 or eQUEST?

or do you know other simulation software (preferable free) that we can
utilize in our LEED design projects and we can get training in DFW area?

thanks

One correction is warranted here.  This is not an EnergyPlus forum, because
EnergyPlus has separate forum, which alone has more traffic than this forum.
Which reminds me to point out that in addition to eQuest, TRACE and few
other software tools mentioned here, you can also look into DesignBuilder
tool, which is graphically oriented, you can quickly prepare your model, you
have templates, no restriction of simple wizard vs. detailed mode, you can
view your model in 3-D including rendered images and walk through the
building interior AND the simulation engine is EnergyPlus, fully promoted
and supported by US DOE as a premier and future simulation engine.

OK, Ardas:

It is 12:30 AM, I am still resolving LEED questions on my model, so it

Since everyone is telling their tale, I will tell you mine.

I began in the energy industry in 1977, after getting an Aeronautical

years. This obviously qualifies me to do energy modeling (????)

Eric,
I had this problem when a co-worker was using version d and I was using
version e.  Make sure you're both using the same version.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] PSZ HP undercooling and questionable reheat energy
Message-ID: <s7691b81.025@rwdi.com>

Hello,
 
I hope someone in the user community can help me with a modelling
problem. I have created a PSZ HP system in eQUEST 3.60, build 5210 and
assigned a zone. The system is scheduled to operate 24/7 and to maintain
a zone temperature between 70F and 73F. 100% outdoor air is supplied to
the zone. The location is in Saudia Arabia (quite hot and humid). I have
set the max. humidity to 50%. The system is autosized with a sizing
ratio of 1.15 and a design day is used.
 
Hourly reports suggest to me that the system is operating rather
strangely. Cooling occurs most hours to dehumidify, but often doesn't
provide adequate cooling or dehumidification for several hours middays.
At these times, return humidity ratios creep up and zone temperatures
rise (sometimes over 100F). One might think that the cooling capacity is
inadequate, but the system PLR is reported as well below 1.0 at these
times. Has anyone else experienced this? Is there a bug in this system
type?

Another issue of concern is that reheat is provided by refrigerant hot
gas, but a significant amount of electrical energy for reheat is
reported. Why would this add any additional work on the compressor? Or
is there something else I'm missing?

Thanks
Derek

All,

The above-referenced schedules are auto-generated by eQuest... I know
the purpose is to model infiltration, but their difference is unclear. 

Perhaps 'P' is for perimeter spaces and 'C' for core spaces?  Where is
this documented?

I don't know where it's documented, but you are right that P is for perimeter and C is for core.

Thanks everyone for your help.  Unfortunately, although the consensus has been that it's a version problem, it doesn't seem to be.  Here's what I've tried so far:
 
-Verifying that the version the in which the file was created is the same version I'm running (It is.)
-Opening the file with 3.6, 3.61b, 3.61e build 5653 and 5360.
-Logging on as an Administrator and running.
-Opening it up on the one machine that can open the file, modifying slightly, and then saving under a different name.
 
None of it got me any farther.
 
Just to re-iterate, this is what happens:
 
-On starting eQuest: "Failed to update the system registry.  Please try using REGEDIT." (doesn't happen when I'm admistrator, but still can't open file)
-The BDL file loads with 35 Warnings (delayed wall, weighting factor) then everything just closes without any error message.
-An ERROORLOG.TXT not generated.

>>> Eric Shadd 12/19/2007 9:34 AM >>>
Thanks Brett, I later found out that the ERRORLOG.TXT that I included was not for this error (closes too quickly to write an ERRORLOG.txt?).  I also found that on other machines, upon opening, they get the error:
 
File Format Error
Line Number:31
Column Number:16
 
I will try opening with an older version...if I can find one.

Hi Gang:
 
I have a part load curve from a chiller manufacturer for input into
eQuest. Unfortunately, it has condenser temperature relief (this is an
evaporatively cooled chiller, so we are speaking of dry bulb outdoor
temperatures.
 
Normally, I ask for a part load curve with a constant condenser
temperature, and let eQuest modify this curve based on changing outdoor
air conditions.
 
But now I have the IPLV data and it deals with condenser relief. I DO
have at what part load a particular condenser temperature occurs
(complimenting this IPLV data.
 
Can anyone help me?

John old buddy, 

Maybe it's the season for nostalgia, but I learned a fair amount about
modeling concepts from both your father and Ross during my years as a
regional energy manager with Hilton.  I still have many fond memories of
late night sessions with your father and Ray Hambel (former Corporate
Director of Engineering for Hilton) where we totally re-designed the
hotels you mentioned and several others on a bar napkin and thought we'd
be able to submit it for plan check later that morning :-)

About the time you made the switch to DOE-2.1A, I made the switch from
Trace (about $150/run back then) to Ross's PC version of ESAS.  It cost
about $3k back then and would do an 8760 simulation in about 1 hour on
an 8088 or 8086 based IBM or compatible PC with math co-processor.

Wishing you and everyone a pleasant holiday season.

OK, Ardas:

It is 12:30 AM, I am still resolving LEED questions on my model, so it
is time to respond.

Since everyone is telling their tale, I will tell you mine.

I began in the energy industry in 1977, after getting an Aeronautical
Engineering Degree and working on the B1-A bomber in Flight test for 5+
years. This obviously qualifies me to do energy modeling (????)

I switched industries, just about the Iran Hostage Crisis (the "Second"
Energy crisis - Lord, gas went up to $0.75/gallon !!). I began working
for my Dad, who was Hilton Hotels and the American Hotel and Motel
Association's Energy guy. I began using the REAL first guru in hourly
energy analysis programs, Ross Meriwether (ASHRAE FELLOW)ESAS program.
It ran on an IBM 370-65 at Trinity University in San Antonio, TX. And we
performed analysis on the Waldorf-Astoria, the Las Vegas Hilton and Las
Vegas Flamingo Hilton, the San Francisco Hilton, and the Hilton Hawaiian
Village in Honolulu, HI.

And I gained weight from the good food.

I switched to DOE-2.1A in 1984, as Ross' program became expensive to run
($1,500/run). I am still indebted to this man, who really taught me what
hourly energy analysis was all about.

I have run DOE-2.1A, B, C, D, E, and now eQuest. I have also run Trace
600 and HAP 3.1.

I have always had respect for TRACE and HAP, as they seem to capsulate
the Design aspect and HVAC coil/fan parameters the best.

However, I am in the energy analysis game, so prefer eQuest. As does
Southern California Edison, pacific Gas and Electric, Rocky Mountain
Power in Utah, and Consolidated Edison and NYSERDA in New York state.

I considered Jeff Hirsch, Marlin Addison, Steve Gates, and Scott
Criswell (all of DOE2 fame) as my friends and colleagues. They have
ALWAYS responded to my queries on eQuest (example
marlin.addison at doe2.com). 

As was stated by several people, one can now actually see the building
as input into eQuest, which the United States Green Building Council
(USGBC) absolutely LOVES.

I have taken 5 Basic courses and two Intermediate course from marlin
Addison, DOE-2 training specialist, and Professor at the Arizona State
University in Phoenix, AZ. Once I finally got the POLYGON concept down,
the rest of eQuest was easy.

But this particular forum is also great for areas that some of us NEVER
cover.

Does TRACE have a similar online forum????? Lord, this is supposed to be
an Energy Plus forum !! And 95% of the traffic is eQUEST RELATED.

What does that tell YOU ??????????????????

Hello Ardas, hello to the Bldg-sim community. 

Short answer: Go with TRACE.

Longer response: 

Ardas, I'm afraid you have given me the opportunity I've been holding
back on, to give my two-cents on the "eQuest or not eQuest" question.
As you can see below, that two-cents has ballooned into several thousand
dollars of thoughts (ha!) but I want to make sure I detail may answers
in the hopes it minimizes any offense taken to those who love eQuest.

I am an engineer working for a consulting firm in Philadelphia.  We have
been fortunate to land several large projects, of which some level of
LEED certification is being sought for each.  I have my LEED AP
certification, and have worked as an energy analyst and LEED
professional on several projects already.  Beyond my engineering
background, I also worked for many years in the IT industry, and have
experience in programming and application integration and development.
Therefore, I am the lucky guy in this office who was chosen to lead the
effort in becoming proficient in energy simulation and modeling
software.  We use different software packages depending on what is best
suited for project needs.  When we began this endeavor, we heard about
eQuest back when it was in its early 3.x series versions, not as far
back as some on this board I know but still far back enough to
appreciate newer developments in the program.  

I describe all of the above so that you know my opinion here comes from
practical experience and hands-on application of not only eQuest, but
other software packages.  With that said: 

Do not use eQuest. Go for TRACE, ENERGY 10, Carrier's HAP, or get into
the Revit vanguard, but if you are coming into the eQuest package cold,
you will find it to be frustrating, unreliable, and above all, lacking
in any real support structure in the event you have questions. 

To elaborate: 

1)There is NO REAL SUPPORT for eQuest users. None. I know creating and
maintaining an open board like Bldg-Sim is a time-consuming, often
thankless tasks, so right off the bat I want to make it clear to those
that have worked hard to make this forum, and probably have some
emotional attachment to it - I applaud your effort and continue to check
the board often for new discussion threads, of which I find several very
interesting.  However, what is often discussed and replied to on the
Bldg-sim board has NOTHING to do with questions regarding the operation
of eQuest.  As an example, recently there was a lively thread regarding
the application of ASHRAE's 90.1 Appdx G rule, which requires the budget
building model to rotate and average its simulated energy performance.
Great discussion to all those involved, I feel I learned a lot thru the
back-and-forth.  However, that discussion had nothing, or very little,
to do with eQuest.  
eQuest has it's origins as a text-only, line-command programming code,
and the graphic user interface (GUI)you see and use is an attempt to
simplify using the code's simulation engine, to reach a wider audience
of engineers who were not proficient in direct coding.  In order to make
the graphic interface manageable, however, the developers had to make
choices as to what code aspects the graphic input screens would first be
connected to, and what would have to wait for later updates.
Ultimately, I think it will be impossible to give the GUI the complete
capabilities as direct coding. That means if you needed to do something
with a system sim that was not represented in the GUI, you must go to
the code directly - a daunting task even for someone with coding
experience, let alone and engineer who has no background in it.  

Since eQuest is a freeware product (or is the proper term shareware? Not
sure...), it was attractive to engineers who did not want to spend a lot
up front to do simulations, and soon the "buzzword" of the eQuest name
got around, and owner reps and other non-tech entities began asking if
their engineers were using eQuest, we must validate with eQuest, how's
that eQuest model coming along, etc.  Of course firms wanted to get on
the bandwagon, and be able to say "sure, we use eQuest" to win projects.
However, what that left the engineer with was a freeware product that
was very detailed even with its GUI, required a large learning curve,
and, since you didn't pay anything for it, had no support line or real
support structure to it.  Even to this day, I am unaware of any
bona-fide support resource.  What made matters worse was that eQuest was
constantly being updated, even the help files.  Often you would go to a
specific topic in the help file, only to find "Under Construction" as
the answer! I've been told that "question packs" would be available, as
in you could pay $400 or so for a set amount of tech issues, but I am
unaware if this has actually gotten off the ground.


When you purchase TRACE or any of the other retail packages, the upfront
cost is required I know, but you have then bought into a real support
structure where you can email or call with questions or problems with
simulation.  I can't stress how important that is.  When you get knee
deep in a building model for a multi-million dollar project, and get
snagged on some techie bug with outputs or software gliches, trust me
you don't want your only means of support to be a discussion forum, you
want to call a software support tech who is being paid to assist you. 

I have other points to this, but the email is getting long in the tooth.
The other points I will make brief and wait for any response: 

2)eQuest operation is frustrating.  If you have a model that can stay
within the Design Wizard mode, most inputs and code-related data is
automatically entered for you, and the sim run smoothly.  However, I
have never had a model which I could fully run in Wiz mode, always
having to access the Detailed Date Edit mode and go bit by bit thru all
the inputs.  Very frustrating.  Also, there are several inputs which are
difficult to understand, and, coupled with the lack of help file
sections, become mysteries.  And lack of user interface features becomes
a pain.  For example, eQuest offers a table-style list of data inputs
for anything from window data to air handler data, but you cannot do
group edits easily such as select a similar column of cells and change
all values at once.
Simulation processing times can be long, and there is no option which
minimizes what is simulated.  Carrier's HAP program for example allows
you to pick and choose what reports are generated, and what simulations
are performed. eQuest just has one large output file with ten thousand
pages.
Maybe there is someone out there who knows some shortcuts to these
specific problems - but that gets back to the support issue - I am now
relying on someone to take the time to explain things to me, and for my
time on this board I have seen many, many question go unanswered.

3)eQuest reports are unreliable.  This may be due to the extensive
detailed inputs that are required for most system comparisons, but the
result remains the same - often eQuest reports (generated thru the DDE
mode) come back with crazy values and conclusions, which are difficult
to analyze.  I've also ran the same report several times on a model that
had no modifications applied, and the results have come back
differently. This may be a factor of eQuest's continuous updates and bug
fixes, but again, if you are responsible for analyzing a multi-million
dollar building for LEED's EAcr1-10, you don't want to be staying up all
night trying to decipher cryptic report results. 

I know eQuest has a lot of potential, and I have had some limited
success in running simple models.  The unfortunate reality is most
models are not simple, and when you enter into the "gaming" of what-ifs
to see how insulation levels affect performance, what would ice storage
be like vs.
chilled water, how does daylight econ impact light loads, water-cooled
compressors on DX units and apply water-side economization, etc etc,
then it doesn't help if you've "heard" eQuest can do all these things,
and have no recourse to find out how it can be operated to do so.  The
reality is there are other very good, very capable simulation packages
out there, that may not have all the detail as eQuest, but at least can
return valid results and support their user base more effectively. 

I think in the final analysis, that the hype of eQuest's purported
capabilities has outpaced the practical reality of its true
capabilities, and we as engineers are stuck trying to connect the open
ends.

Hope this helps,

hi,

 we are planning to use EQUEST or TRACE 700 for energy simulation. 

 Is eQUEST an approved software by USGBC (in Texas)?

Where can we get training in DFW (Dallas Fort Worth) area?

 Which one is easier, faster? Trace 700 or eQUEST?

or do you know other simulation software (preferable free) that we can
utilize in our LEED design projects and we can get training in DFW area?

thanks

Ardas

Unfortunately the IPLV is of little or no value when setting up chiller
curves. To set up the EIR-fT and EIR-fPLR curves requires more data points
than is available in the IPLV. IPLV basically describes a two-dimensional
curve, whereas the actual chiller performance is 3-dimensional.  The IPLV
assumes that condenser temperature drops as chiller load drops, but this is
not necessarily the case. Examples:

1.	A cooling tower has a fixed setpoint of 85?F.  Or, the condenser
water source is a lake or river.  In this case condenser temperature does
not drop as chiller load drops.
2.	A large plant has 3 chillers utilizing a single cooling tower.  The
current load is 33% of design, so one chiller is running at full load. IPLV
assumes an entering condenser temperature of 85?F (full load), whereas the
cooling tower is actually lightly loaded and can achieve a smaller approach
to wetbulb.
3.	The building is on the West coast (low wetbulb) vs. Florida (high
wetbulb). Tower performance and condenser temperature vs. load is entirely
different in these two climates.

So while IPLV may be an interesting figure for rough comparisons, it is
insufficient for an hourly simulation program. This is true for all energy
simulation programs, not just eQUEST. Ultimately this issue will need to be
addressed by standards organizations such as ARI, and/or equipment
manufacturers.

The way I "deal" with this is by using a spreadsheet I've built which
evaluates groups of the DOE-2.2 chiller curves at any combination of
temperatures and loads. In this situation I would evaluate a number of
DOE2 chiller curves' output EIRs and CAPs at the IPLV or NPLV condensing
and evaporating temperatures, delta Ts, and PLRs. Then compare these
with the rated values at the four "EIRs" given by the IPLV/NPLV values.
Then pick the curves with the best match (hopefully all in the same
family!). If that fails, simply make an educated guess of the difference
between reality and the model and correct the model result with that, or
try to create some better curves. If the real chiller seems to have much
better low-load performance, possibly model more chillers than the real
proposed case, though I have seen that backfire.
 
Having said that, I think USGBC should disallow any claims for improved
chiller (or really any equipment) part load performance vs the baseline
unless the manufacturer has supplied off-design performance data
adequate to characterize the chiller and usable in the analyst's
simulation program. For their part USGBC, ASHRAE, or the IRS need to
define similar off-design performance data that correspond with the
minimum performance IPLVs in Table 6.8. Maybe the USGBC could hire
someone quickly to do this with some of the million bucks they have
budgeted for "green bldg research." The ASHRAE App G text should
probably stick to the big picture. In the ACM, the California Energy
Commission has defined chiller curves for the T24 "standard" case model
(these evaluate to better than the ASHRAE minimum IPLVs) and they also
have some restrictions on claims of improved part load performance in
the "design" model.

Unfortunately the IPLV is of little or no value when setting up chiller
curves. To set up the EIR-fT and EIR-fPLR curves requires more data
points than is available in the IPLV. IPLV basically describes a
two-dimensional curve, whereas the actual chiller performance is
3-dimensional.  The IPLV assumes that condenser temperature drops as
chiller load drops, but this is not necessarily the case. Examples:A
cooling tower has a fixed setpoint of 85?F.  Or, the condenser water
source is a lake or river.  In this case condenser temperature does not
drop as chiller load drops. A large plant has 3 chillers utilizing a
single cooling tower.  The current load is 33% of design, so one chiller
is running at full load. IPLV assumes an entering condenser temperature
of 85?F (full load), whereas the cooling tower is actually lightly
loaded and can achieve a smaller approach to wetbulb. The building is on
the West coast (low wetbulb) vs. Florida (high wetbulb). Tower
performance and condenser temperature vs. load is entirely different in
these two climates. 

So while IPLV may be an interesting figure for rough comparisons, it is
insufficient for an hourly simulation program. This is true for all
energy simulation programs, not just eQUEST. Ultimately this issue will
need to be addressed by standards organizations such as ARI, and/or
equipment manufacturers.

Hi Gang:
 
I have a part load curve from a chiller manufacturer for input into
eQuest. Unfortunately, it has condenser temperature relief (this is an
evaporatively cooled chiller, so we are speaking of dry bulb outdoor
temperatures.
 
Normally, I ask for a part load curve with a constant condenser
temperature, and let eQuest modify this curve based on changing outdoor
air conditions.
 
But now I have the IPLV data and it deals with condenser relief. I DO
have at what part load a particular condenser temperature occurs
(complimenting this IPLV data.
 
Can anyone help me?

Can you tell what is on line 31 in column 16 in the BDL?

Maybe delete out that component and reopen.  You may have to recreate a
few building components...?

Thanks everyone for your help.  Unfortunately, although the consensus
has been that it's a version problem, it doesn't seem to be.  Here's
what I've tried so far:

 

-Verifying that the version the in which the file was created is the
same version I'm running (It is.)

-Opening the file with 3.6, 3.61b, 3.61e build 5653 and 5360.

-Logging on as an Administrator and running.

-Opening it up on the one machine that can open the file, modifying
slightly, and then saving under a different name.

 

None of it got me any farther.

 

Just to re-iterate, this is what happens:

 

-On starting eQuest: "Failed to update the system registry.  Please try
using REGEDIT." (doesn't happen when I'm admistrator, but still can't
open file)

-The BDL file loads with 35 Warnings (delayed wall, weighting factor)
then everything just closes without any error message.

-An ERROORLOG.TXT not generated.

>>> Eric Shadd 12/19/2007 9:34 AM >>>

Thanks Brett, I later found out that the ERRORLOG.TXT that I included
was not for this error (closes too quickly to write an ERRORLOG.txt?).
I also found that on other machines, upon opening, they get the error:

 

File Format Error
Line Number:31
Column Number:16

 

I will try opening with an older version...if I can find one.

I had this problem when a co-worker was using version d and I was using

John,

Here's a thought. Speaking from memory.

I believe in CoolTools you can insert the data you have (IPLV data), say at 4-5 conditions and then it will search it against a library and suggest a closest match.

When you select a match (assuming you get one) then you can have it spit out the EIR-fT, CAP-Ft and EIR-fPLR curves. 

Obsiously you need CoolTools to do this. I tried searching for it and wasn't able to fine it (only 5 minutes).

You could try calling PGE Energy Center and have them locate it for you. It is supposed to be a free ware.

 

Thanks,

Rishabh

IPLV assumes an entering condenser temperature of 85?F (full load), whereas the cooling tower is actually lightly loaded and can achieve a smaller approach to wetbulb. 
3.	The building is on the West coast (low wetbulb) vs. Florida (high wetbulb). Tower performance and condenser temperature vs. load is entirely different in these two climates. 

So while IPLV may be an interesting figure for rough comparisons, it is insufficient for an hourly simulation program. This is true for all energy simulation programs, not just eQUEST. Ultimately this issue will need to be addressed by standards organizations such as ARI, and/or equipment manufacturers.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Chiller part load raw data points into eQuest

 

Hi Gang:

 

I have a part load curve from a chiller manufacturer for input into eQuest. Unfortunately, it has condenser temperature relief (this is an evaporatively cooled chiller, so we are speaking of dry bulb outdoor temperatures.

 

Normally, I ask for a part load curve with a constant condenser temperature, and let eQuest modify this curve based on changing outdoor air conditions.

 

But now I have the IPLV data and it deals with condenser relief. I DO have at what part load a particular condenser temperature occurs (complimenting this IPLV data.

 

Can anyone help me?

The Energy Center of Wisconsin is setting up another eQuest training
session for the spring and probably another in the fall. (We just had a
two-day session last week, so you just missed it.) The first day is
basic training and the second day is intermediate. You can sign up for
either day or both days. We are accepting names of people interested in
the spring session. We will send you details when they are finalized. If
you are interested, please send your contact information to Kathryn
Schiedermayer at kschiedermayer at ecw.org.

We also have other training opportunities that you might be interested
in, so check out our website at www.ecw.org. Click on "events calendar"

Message-ID: <AA9B9F375669B94D9634E480F2EC721C0254ADE0@ossa.TWGI.com>

In Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1-2004, the baseline HVAC system type
specified by Table G3.1.1 for small buildings is a packaged single zone
system with direct expansion cooling.  If heating is electric, then an
electric heat pump is also specified.  

 

For systems under 65,000 BTU/H, Table 6.1B of the standard lists 12.0
SEER for unitary air cooled systems in a cooling mode and 7.4 HSPF for
these systems in a heat pump heating mode.  Both SEER and HSPF are
seasonal efficiency values that are based on certain assumptions that
may not match the operation of an actual building.

 

Does anyone know how to translate these seasonal efficiencies into a
point-in-time efficiency that is meaningful to an hourly energy
simulation? Or is there some other accepted way to handle the problem?

I think eQuest and TRACE are becoming dated with new architectural programs such as REVIT, ARCHICAD, etc. that most architects are using that can be used with IES-VE, Energy Plus, and other programs. I'd be curious about any opinions on the success or failure of those who have taken that next step of taking a 3D archicad or revit model and imported into IESVE or Energy Plus and how easy it is for architects to produce a compatible file for modelers to use as they have to do a few things to make it compatitable for moderlers to use.

Now this is the beginning of a very useful thread!

Steve Playo pointed out some important things to consider in choosing an
energy simulation program.  I also agree with Karen Walkerman in her defense
of eQUEST.  I, too, would use it in preference to TRACE in most cases.

What too many people do not realize is energy simulation is a very
complicated and detailed process.  Far too many assume the eQUEST wizard or
the TRACE entry method will allow them to simulate a building for LEED or
whatever without going through the agony of learning what the building is
doing or how the program models it.  It just isn't going to happen.

I have been doing energy simulation for 30 years.  I started with Cal-ERDA
1.3 (predecessor to DOE-2.2, the eQUEST calculation engine) on a time shared
main frame computer.  After a couple years of expensive time sharing, I
helped my employer install DOE-2.1 on a DEC System 10 main frame.  In 1986,
I left that employer to do energy simulation for my own company.  Over the
years, I have used DOE, TRACE, BLAST, and a number of other simulation
programs.  I have taken training courses in most of the ones I have used and
assisted in training courses for eQUEST.  The point is that even now, I
learn something new on every project.  I used to say that running DOE took
the equivalent of a five hour college course.  Now, I think it is the
equivalent of a college degree.

Don't worry about how cheap the program is to obtain.  Whatever it costs
will pale compared to the cost of learning how to use it.  Take the training
for whatever program you are going to use and then expect to spend a lot
more time on the learning curve.

This is not to discourage using energy simulation.  Energy simulation is a
wonderful tool.  It is easy to come up with more than enough energy and
dollar savings to offset the additional engineering hours.  And it will only
become more important in the future.  It's just not as easy as some people
would like to think.

Hi All,

I too have spent many frustrating nights trying to figure out what is wrong
with my eQuest models.  After all the brow-beating, I have always come to
the conclusion that something was wrong with my inputs, not with the
software, and been able to remedy the issue.  Not true for Trace700.  I
spent about a year with Trace, found a number of bugs (some of which the
company is now fixing), got frustrated with the long (hour-plus) simulation
times, and limitation to modeling 4 alternatives in one file.  Yes it's nice
that there's someone to call when you have questions, but they don't always
know the answer.  I had people telling me to check my fan energy inputs when
the odd data I was getting had nothing to do with fans.

In addition, I often have trouble with data corruption when editing
templates.  Granted, templates are a great idea and I wish eQuest had a
similar option, but when your inputs are corrupted and you have to go
through and check room by room to see what remains...  not a fun process.

Trace700 has no visual feedback for window, wall, room or roof geometry.
This can be a pain.

I also believe that their water source heat-pump system does not share
energy in the loop properly.  I created a test-file, consisting of two
10X10X10 rooms.  One room had a large cooling load, the other a large
heating mode.  Neither had any external surface areas.  The total energy
required to condition the spaces should have been much lower for heat pumps
than for fain coils... but, they were practically identical.  I sent the
model to Trace, and they argued that this was not a fair test of their
software????

So... though eQuest can be frustrating at times, I gladly use it over Trace.

I would like to know other people's experience as well.  I have been using eQuest for some time and more recently have been experimenting with IES <VE>.  I have been entering geometry into IES by hand so that I could become familiar with the program.  In the mean time I have been given 2 different Revit gbxml files that were provided by architects but I have been unsuccessful in importing them into IES.  Problems with the zones not being identified and other related issues have been the sticking point.  Once these issues are resolved and the architect understands what needs to be done prior to exporting a gbxml file I will have a much better feel of Revit/ IES capabilities.  On paper this looks like a very powerful tool...

Renee,
 
I don't believe eQuest and Trace are dated, REVIT is very expensive and has a steep learning curve, IES-VE uses the British Admittance method which is very foreign to alot of U.S. M&E's and EnergyPlus is still painfully slow especially for large parametric runs. In fact, eQuest has just been integrated in a BIM program called dProfiler from Beck Technology. I've seen a demo a few weeks ago and was very impressed. Like the Energizer Bunny, that old DOE-2 engine keeps going and going.

I think eQuest and TRACE are becoming dated with new architectural programs such as REVIT, ARCHICAD, etc. that most architects are using that can be used with IES-VE, Energy Plus, and other programs. I'd be curious about any opinions on the success or failure of those who have taken that next step of taking a 3D archicad or revit model and imported into IESVE or Energy Plus and how easy it is for architects to produce a compatible file for modelers to use as they have to do a few things to make it compatitable for moderlers to use.

Hi All,

I too have spent many frustrating nights trying to figure out what is wrong
with my eQuest models.  After all the brow-beating, I have always come to
the conclusion that something was wrong with my inputs, not with the
software, and been able to remedy the issue.  Not true for Trace700.  I
spent about a year with Trace, found a number of bugs (some of which the
company is now fixing), got frustrated with the long (hour-plus) simulation
times, and limitation to modeling 4 alternatives in one file.  Yes it's nice
that there's someone to call when you have questions, but they don't always
know the answer.  I had people telling me to check my fan energy inputs when
the odd data I was getting had nothing to do with fans.

In addition, I often have trouble with data corruption when editing
templates.  Granted, templates are a great idea and I wish eQuest had a
similar option, but when your inputs are corrupted and you have to go
through and check room by room to see what remains...  not a fun process.

Trace700 has no visual feedback for window, wall, room or roof geometry.
This can be a pain.

I also believe that their water source heat-pump system does not share
energy in the loop properly.  I created a test-file, consisting of two
10X10X10 rooms.  One room had a large cooling load, the other a large
heating mode.  Neither had any external surface areas.  The total energy
required to condition the spaces should have been much lower for heat pumps
than for fain coils... but, they were practically identical.  I sent the
model to Trace, and they argued that this was not a fair test of their
software????

So... though eQuest can be frustrating at times, I gladly use it over Trace.

Building physics is specialised. 

I was speaking to a senior director of a leading consultancy here in the uk recently. He divulged that although sophisticated bim modelling had helped to bring projects in on budget it hadn't benefitted building physics. Furthermore, even if a bim model existed for a project a thermal model would still need created from scratch!

I cannot speak for ARCHICAD but am aware that revit carries a limited subset of IES. And, whilst it can export for analysis to the full version of IES the output is geometry only and can be unreliable especially if the original revit model is poor. That means all construction, room and air flow info  must be reapplied.

Tools such as ecotect can be useful for some studies as they can take in a myriad of input file types and enable conversion to energy analysis.

There is no seamless integration it's a long way off (20 years at this rate). Employ experienced energy modellers using accredited tools. Perhaps it isn't so much what choice of software but the right well trained people. When you consider the cost of putting the people resource into place the cost of software can pale into insignificance.

Ren?e,

I signed up to bldg-sim listserv recently.  We recently switched from
AutoCAD (2d drafting) to Revit (BIM, 3d modeling).  It's a little too soon
to say that "most architects are using" ... Revit, Archicad, etc.  There
appears to be a paradigm shift or change in-progress in the industry, but
surveys I've seen have said that larger architectural firms have started
with some modeling (BIM, Revit, etc) and less so in smaller firms.  Like
you, I will be interested to see responses to your questions about using the
Revit (or other) 3d model for building simulation.  It's my understanding
that Revit Architecture exports to gbXML which then goes to IES.  Or, from
Revit Architecture to www.greenbuilding.com web analysis (limited to a few
number of runs).  Or from architect using Revit Architecture to mech
engineer using Revit MEP (same model) and from Revit MEP directly to IES
running inside Revit MEP.  Or, new IES plug-in tool for Revit Architecture
(one of the links below).  There are some important steps in modeling for
successful output to IES enumerated in the first link below.

I am involved in developing what we are calling an advanced building studio at my architecture firm. I have some background with this, but am still relatively new. We have been experimenting with several softwares that would be compatible in any facet with revit (our firms BIM tool of choice) we finally settled on IES VE and i think it was a solid decision. I have found that it is certainly not the quickest tool for the iterative design loops we all want, but when you really want to drill down into how your design choices are impacting the internal environment it is the best comprehensive package out there. (there are minor conversion issues being an English system, but give it a little time and you get used to it, the support system available is worth it alone) 
As architects we are really most concerned with reducing the loads on the building so that our engineers can select the best system for reducing energy. this is were energy modeling gets tricky for us architects who are not really qualified to make the specific mechanical decisions that some of these softwares require at the start. another reason that as we dive into these softwares we should be constantly consulting our engineers from day one on the project. We looked at IES, GBS, equest, and ecotect. and determined that it is not one of these that we need to settle on, but rather develop a strategy that involves several tools for getting quick results to mitigate the big decisions then switch software for drilling down deeper. it seems to be working so far. this also allows us to constantly compare/confirm results between software. 
as a bit of a side note. the new plugin for revit architecture has made the link even easier. the toolkit is nice for 30 sec checks, but more importantly when you setup building properties in the IES link within revit they stay with the building through the export to the full version of IES. this means you only have to put those values in once even if you change your geometry. a big time saver. 
Also to Josh, the biggest thing to understand with revit and gbxml is how to set up Rooms (there is documentation that someone linked to earlier). They determine everything, which is unfortunate because the Rooms feature in Revit is, shall we say, intellectually bereft.

I've had some limited experience using
the Revit IES VE link and have found the translation of building information
to work well. ?In some cases I did find that building materials specifications
didn't translate properly and had to be re-specified inside IES VE. ?Revit
also lacks the ability to specify HVAC zones and equipment parameters so
these also had to be input directly into IES VE. ?I think these tools
are very promising for analyzing early design decisions without the need
to create a separate thermal model. ?Unfortunately the interoperability
only works in one direction so changes to the building in IES VE don't
translate back into Revit. ?In the future I would like to be able
to create a gbXML file from Revit and import that directly into eQuest.

I would like to know other people's experience as
well. ?I have been using eQuest for some time and more recently have
been experimenting with IES <VE>. ?I have been entering geometry
into IES by hand so that I could become familiar with the program. ?In
the mean time I have been given 2 different Revit gbxml files that were
provided by architects but I have been unsuccessful in importing them into
IES. ?Problems with the zones not being identified and other related
issues have been the sticking point. ?Once these issues are resolved
and the architect understands what needs to be done prior to exporting

In addition, I often have trouble with data corruption when editing

templates. ?Granted, templates are a great idea and I wish eQuest
had a

similar option, but when your inputs are corrupted and you have to go

through and check room by room to see what remains... ?not a fun process.



Trace700 has no visual feedback for window, wall, room or roof geometry.

This can be a pain.



I also believe that their water source heat-pump system does not share

energy in the loop properly. ?I created a test-file, consisting of
two

10X10X10 rooms. ?One room had a large cooling load, the other a large

heating mode. ?Neither had any external surface areas. ?The total
energy

required to condition the spaces should have been much lower for heat pumps

than for fain coils... but, they were practically identical. ?I sent
the

model to Trace, and they argued that this was not a fair test of their

software????



So... though eQuest can be frustrating at times, I gladly use it over Trace.

Scott Criswell had no problems loading the file and subsequently deleted some data relating to a) the initial program module being directed to the results module and b) the 3-D view geometry settings (all Greek to me) in hopes that it might solve the problem.  Unfortunately I still get the same problem.
 
I recently dug through some old emails and found that the creator of the model had some crashes while running Title 24 compliance, and it seemed to be machine-specific (as is mine).  However I have a completely new computer.
 
I've been hands off for the past couple of days, but will try the last/latest suggestion:  Using a text editor to change the climate inputs back to the default in the pd2.  Any ideas on registry problems anyone?
 
FYI I had already tried opening from the INP file, and re-installing eQuest.

>>> Eric Shadd 12/19/2007 1:28 PM >>>
Thanks everyone for your help.  Unfortunately, although the consensus has been that it's a version problem, it doesn't seem to be.  Here's what I've tried so far:
 
-Verifying that the version the in which the file was created is the same version I'm running (It is.)
-Opening the file with 3.6, 3.61b, 3.61e build 5653 and 5360.
-Logging on as an Administrator and running.
-Opening it up on the one machine that can open the file, modifying slightly, and then saving under a different name.
 
None of it got me any farther.
 
Just to re-iterate, this is what happens:
 
-On starting eQuest: "Failed to update the system registry.  Please try using REGEDIT." (doesn't happen when I'm admistrator, but still can't open file)
-The BDL file loads with 35 Warnings (delayed wall, weighting factor) then everything just closes without any error message.
-An ERROORLOG.TXT not generated.

>>> Eric Shadd 12/19/2007 9:34 AM >>>
Thanks Brett, I later found out that the ERRORLOG.TXT that I included was not for this error (closes too quickly to write an ERRORLOG.txt?).  I also found that on other machines, upon opening, they get the error:
 
File Format Error
Line Number:31
Column Number:16
 
I will try opening with an older version...if I can find one.

I had this problem when a co-worker was using version d and I was using
version e.  Make sure you're both using the same version.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modeling garage ventilation based on CO levels in eQuest
Message-ID: <00c301c845eb$6bf70100$d801a8c0@yingz>

Hi -
Any suggestions about modeling garage ventilation based on CO levels in
eQuest?
 
The underground garage has no cooling and heating, but it is ventilated
based on CO detection. Both supply and exhaust fans will run when a high CO
level is detected, and stop a few minutes after the level is back to normal.
 
Since no heating and cooling is designed, the unit ventilator is selected in
the wizard. Then in the detailed mode, the DCV option does not appear to be
applicable for this case. 
 
Could any one help me with this?
 
Thanks in advance!

of the Parameter and Symbolic Index functions, but I want to use others such

Dear all,

The Annual Energy Outlook 2008 by the DOE EIA (
http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/aeo/trends.html) predicts that in 2030, 83% US
primary energy supply requirements would still be met by traditional fossil
fuels, compared to 85% in 2006. I find this in direct contrast with goals
set by initiatives like Architecture 2030...

Does anybody know more about how realistic these predictions are and if
there are better opportunities for renewable energy?

I think we are in flux right now, and as such its going to be hard to
make a prediction based on trends. For example, if the federal RPS had
passed, the outlook would have been very different. Ultimately its not
entirely an issue of percentages, but also absolute numbers. For example
in the 1940s - 1950s, there was a 30% renewable mix. Today we produce
more renewable energy, but the overall percentage is far below. 
 
Initiatives like architecture 2030 work towards reducing the overall
consumption levels. We need policy makers to step in and encourage the
other side of the equation. One of the items removed from the recently
passed bill was a motion to transfer 13.5 billion dollars in subsidies
(billion with a B) from the top 5 oil corporations to fund renewable
energy production. 
 
To quote Al Gore in his Nobel speech: 
We have everything we need to get started, save perhaps political will,
but political will is a renewable resource. 

So let us renew it, and say together: "We have a purpose. We are many.
For this purpose we will rise, and we will act."

(http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/aeo/trends.html) predicts that in 2030, 83%
US primary energy supply requirements would still be met by traditional
fossil fuels, compared to 85% in 2006. I find this in direct contrast
with goals set by initiatives like Architecture 2030... 

Does anybody know more about how realistic these predictions are and if
there are better opportunities for renewable energy?

Thanks,

Sorry for the cryptic email title. I spent most of Monday building the
shell for this building I am trying to model in eQUEST. The building has
multiple punched openings in a number of facades, so instead of creating
individual components, I created linked copied (to make it easier to
edit).
 
Well-  today I tried to open my file, and it is giving me multiple
errors along with showing most of my walls missing.
 
Has this happened to anyone before? If so, is there an easy fix for it?
 
Thanks

You may find that the missing walls are in order according to the hierarchy
tree on the left, and that the missing walls are because of an error from
the first wall missing in this tree.  Fix whatever error you may have in the
first one and every wall linked to it may be corrected.

FYI. 

The U-effective method, as described in the Winklemann-Huang article in the DOE-2 User's News has advice on this. You'll get the best results with CWFs and ground temperatures estimated using Kusuda's method.

All,
 
The following slide was generated by Art Rosenfeld from the California Energy Commission it illustrates that energy conservation & efficiency policy does work. California energy policy demonstrates this very clearly, we need to Washington to understand this.

I think we are in flux right now, and as such its going to be hard to make a prediction based on trends. For example, if the federal RPS had passed, the outlook would have been very different. Ultimately its not entirely an issue of percentages, but also absolute numbers. For example in the 1940s - 1950s, there was a 30% renewable mix. Today we produce more renewable energy, but the overall percentage is far below. 
 
Initiatives like architecture 2030 work towards reducing the overall consumption levels. We need policy makers to step in and encourage the other side of the equation. One of the items removed from the recently passed bill was a motion to transfer 13.5 billion dollars in subsidies (billion with a B) from the top 5 oil corporations to fund renewable energy production. 
 
To quote Al Gore in his Nobel speech: 
We have everything we need to get started, save perhaps political will, but political will is a renewable resource. 

So let us renew it, and say together: "We have a purpose. We are many. For this purpose we will rise, and we will act."

Don't put too much stock in the AEO. The AEO is just a long term, steady state projection under current policy conditions, and the modelled macro-economic variables in the AEO iteslf, i.e. a putatative "most likely" case. 

In this case, it is almost a foregone conclusion that the policy conditions will be different from what the AEO modelled. After the conclusion of the "Bali" post-Kyoto round in 2 to 4 years, there will be some sort of worldwide agreement to limit Carbon emissions, and that will feedback into future AEO's before 2030. 

The other thing the AEO, and other long-term models are not good at modelling is technology discontinuity. Because of the large interest that has been generated in this topic, the odds are very high is that some technologies will come along that change some of the economic assumptions (relative costs of energy from various sources) within the AEO model well before 2030.

TRNSYS has an excellent slab-on-grade model with perimeter insulation that
was tested as part of the IEA Task 34/43 work and earned the tag of
"reference standard".  The only building simulation tool model to do so. 
The other two reference standards were models developed in Fluent and
Matlab.  You may want to get yourself a copy of that report as it details
the advantages and disadvantages of the current simlation tool models for
slab-on-grade construction.

Good morning,

This is my first try at using this communication tool.

In reflecting on Vikram Sami's statistic of 30% renewable energy mix, 
I suspect the hydroelectric was the major contributor, but the 
potential for growth was not available/desirable.  What similar 
pitfalls need to be kept in mind with our advocacy for the major 
renewables of solar, wind, and biomass(others?) so our advocacy is 
taken more seriously?

Thanks

Apologies for the size of this email, but I thought this might be
interesting. 
Here's a similar graph to what Harvey is talking about that I
extrapolated from the EIA database. 
 
The interesting thing is that if you look at what they are doing in
Germany (slides below are reproduced with permission from Gerhardt
Stryi-Hipp) the feed-in tariffs have obviously done wonders there. They
expect to reach grid parity for PV by 2018.

All,

I believe Amory Lovins has plotted the AEO trend estimates for the last
thirty years, which shows that it has been consistently wrong. If I can
find that plot I will send it to everyone. Perhaps Aalok can ask Amory
for that famous plot.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Grim projection of renewable energy use



Don't put too much stock in the AEO. The AEO is just a long term, steady
state projection under current policy conditions, and the modelled
macro-economic variables in the AEO iteslf, i.e. a putatative "most
likely" case.

In this case, it is almost a foregone conclusion that the policy
conditions will be different from what the AEO modelled. After the
conclusion of the "Bali" post-Kyoto round in 2 to 4 years, there will be
some sort of worldwide agreement to limit Carbon emissions, and that
will feedback into future AEO's before 2030.

The other thing the AEO, and other long-term models are not good at
modelling is technology discontinuity. Because of the large interest
that has been generated in this topic, the odds are very high is that
some technologies will come along that change some of the economic
assumptions (relative costs of energy from various sources) within the
AEO model well before 2030.

I think we are in flux right now, and as such its going to be hard to
make a prediction based on trends. For example, if the federal RPS had
passed, the outlook would have been very different. Ultimately its not
entirely an issue of percentages, but also absolute numbers. For example
in the 1940s - 1950s, there was a 30% renewable mix. Today we produce
more renewable energy, but the overall percentage is far below.
Initiatives like architecture 2030 work towards reducing the overall
consumption levels. We need policy makers to step in and encourage the
other side of the equation. One of the items removed from the recently
passed bill was a motion to transfer 13.5 billion dollars in subsidies
(billion with a B) from the top 5 oil corporations to fund renewable
energy production.
To quote Al Gore in his Nobel speech:
We have everything we need to get started, save perhaps political will,
but political will is a renewable resource.

So let us renew it, and say together: "We have a purpose. We are many.
For this purpose we will rise, and we will act."

Dear all,

The Annual Energy Outlook 2008 by the DOE EIA (
http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/aeo/trends.html) predicts that in 2030, 83%
US primary energy supply requirements would still be met by traditional
fossil fuels, compared to 85% in 2006. I find this in direct contrast
with goals set by initiatives like Architecture 2030...

Does anybody know more about how realistic these predictions are and if
there are better opportunities for renewable energy?

Thanks,

The report Jeff mentioned, which extends BESTEST (Building Energy Simulation
Test and Diagnostic Method) to include test cases for slab-on-grade heat
transfer, is currently going through the International Energy Agency (IEA)
approval process and pre-publication editing/formating by National Renewable
Energy Laboratory (NREL). We are planning for it to be published/posted
(publicly available) mid-2008.

Message-ID: <EB124710ADB8554C930FADF760BB2BE7027CD725@n-yexc01.global.arup.com>

Hello All,

 

I have a question about the way eQuest / DOE 2.2 decided whether it
should be using the heating or cooling zone setpoint for a particular
hour.  

 

I am modeling a PSZ system with energy recovery (enthalpy wheel with
mixed air reset and "modulate hx" capacity control) and am finding that
when I remove the energy recovery from the model, energy use decreases.
When I look at the hourly reports, there are a number of hours where the
"no erv" model is using a heating setpoint and the "erv" model is using
a cooling setpoint for the zone particularly in the winter.  Any ideas
about how this setpoint gets chosen and why the ERV would be affecting
it?  

 

Any ideas would be very much appreciated.

 

Thanks!

 

Corinne Benedek

In terms of the sub uses what decreases?  Sometimes your fan energy  
will increase so much that it over shadows the decrease in cooling and  
heating.

Both vent fan usage and cooling increase significantly.  From the hourly
reports, it's not looking like it's a balancing issue in terms of fans
vs cooling.

Heating does decrease with the ERV.  The fan energy increase seems to
make sense in principle, but I'm still not sure why there are hours when
the cooling setpoint (75 deg F) is being used in the model with the ERV
where the heating setpoint (70) is being used in the non-erv model.

Thanks for the suggestion! - but interestingly enough, I do already have
Mixed Air Reset as my setting. 

Any idea what mechanism it is that chooses which setpoint to follow?  I
can't seem to find any patterns that suggest what is happening.

 

Thanks!

If you have Make-up Air Temp Ctrl at the default (floating), you will be
delivering warmer air, driving the space to the cooling setpoint and
engaging mechanical cooling.  Recommend changing this to "mixed air
reset", that way you will have normal economizer operation.

Under Control Sequences try changing Operation to OA Exhaust DT or OA
Exhaust DH and specify temperature/enthalpy difference. This should help
with cooling/heating energy. 
Also under second tab (Heat Recovery 2) verify that pressure drop @
design flow for make-up.exhaust is what you are expecting. This should
help with fan energy.

Aleka:

Try opening the .PD2 file in a text editor (The
parametric inputs). I believe you CAN change the
order, as long as you are careful.

You can always recreated your Parametric inputs, if
you "screen save" the inputs.

Try it.

Try the *.prd files, use notepad or other text editor to open them.

 

The order of options should be okay to change, except be careful with
any runs that are based on options other than the baseline case.

 

I would also delete all of the existing simulation outputs from the
prior parametric sims to start with a clean slate.

It looks to me like you can change the order of the runs by changing the label number in the parametric run definitions window.  The label number corresponds to the order in which the runs are performed.

Fixed it.  I created a totally new building with the Schematic Design
Wizard and accepted all the defaults.  I then kept bringing in sections
of the bad INP file to this good INP file, running it in eQuest, until I
ran into problems (using MS Word?s ?Compare and Merge? feature).  The
below ended up being the corrupt (?) sections.  Please let me know if
you see anything funny in them and/or how I can re-enter this data
safely.

Thanks everyone for your help and responsiveness.

Scott Criswell had no problems loading the file and subsequently deleted
some data relating to a) the initial program module being directed to
the results module and b) the 3-D view geometry settings (all Greek to
me) in hopes that it might solve the problem.  Unfortunately I still get
the same problem.
 
I recently dug through some old emails and found that the creator of the
model had some crashes while running Title 24 compliance, and it seemed
to be machine-specific (as is mine).  However I have a completely new
computer.
 
I've been hands off for the past couple of days, but will try the
last/latest suggestion:  Using a text editor to change the climate
inputs back to the default in the pd2.  Any ideas on registry problems
anyone?
 
FYI I had already tried opening from the INP file, and re-installing
eQuest.

Thanks everyone for your help.  Unfortunately, although the consensus
has been that it's a version problem, it doesn't seem to be.  Here's
what I've tried so far:
 
-Verifying that the version the in which the file was created is the
same version I'm running (It is.)
-Opening the file with 3.6, 3.61b, 3.61e build 5653 and 5360.
-Logging on as an Administrator and running.
-Opening it up on the one machine that can open the file, modifying
slightly, and then saving under a different name.
 
None of it got me any farther.
 
Just to re-iterate, this is what happens:
 
-On starting eQuest: "Failed to update the system registry.  Please try
using REGEDIT." (doesn't happen when I'm admistrator, but still can't
open file)
-The BDL file loads with 35 Warnings (delayed wall, weighting factor)
then everything just closes without any error message.
-An ERROORLOG.TXT not generated.

>>> Eric Shadd 12/19/2007 9:34 AM >>>
Thanks Brett, I later found out that the ERRORLOG.TXT that I included
was not for this error (closes too quickly to write an ERRORLOG.txt?). 
I also found that on other machines, upon opening, they get the error:
 
File Format Error
Line Number:31
Column Number:16
 
I will try opening with an older version...if I can find one.

I had this problem when a co-worker was using version d and I was using

don't predict oil prices to hit current $ levels for another 10 years.

All,
 
I believe Amory Lovins has plotted the AEO trend estimates for the last
thirty years, which shows that it has been consistently wrong. If I can
find that plot I will send it to everyone. Perhaps Aalok can ask Amory
for that famous plot.

Don't put too much stock in the AEO. The AEO is just a long term, steady
state projection under current policy conditions, and the modelled
macro-economic variables in the AEO iteslf, i.e. a putatative "most
likely" case. 

In this case, it is almost a foregone conclusion that the policy
conditions will be different from what the AEO modelled. After the
conclusion of the "Bali" post-Kyoto round in 2 to 4 years, there will be
some sort of worldwide agreement to limit Carbon emissions, and that
will feedback into future AEO's before 2030. 

The other thing the AEO, and other long-term models are not good at
modelling is technology discontinuity. Because of the large interest
that has been generated in this topic, the odds are very high is that
some technologies will come along that change some of the economic
assumptions (relative costs of energy from various sources) within the
AEO model well before 2030.

I think we are in flux right now, and as such its going to be hard to
make a prediction based on trends. For example, if the federal RPS had
passed, the outlook would have been very different. Ultimately its not
entirely an issue of percentages, but also absolute numbers. For example
in the 1940s - 1950s, there was a 30% renewable mix. Today we produce
more renewable energy, but the overall percentage is far below. 
Initiatives like architecture 2030 work towards reducing the overall
consumption levels. We need policy makers to step in and encourage the
other side of the equation. One of the items removed from the recently
passed bill was a motion to transfer 13.5 billion dollars in subsidies
(billion with a B) from the top 5 oil corporations to fund renewable
energy production. 
To quote Al Gore in his Nobel speech: 
We have everything we need to get started, save perhaps political will,
but political will is a renewable resource. 

So let us renew it, and say together: "We have a purpose. We are many.
For this purpose we will rise, and we will act."

Dear all, 

The Annual Energy Outlook 2008 by the DOE EIA
(http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/aeo/trends.html) predicts that in 2030, 83%
US primary energy supply requirements would still be met by traditional
fossil fuels, compared to 85% in 2006. I find this in direct contrast
with goals set by initiatives like Architecture 2030... 

Does anybody know more about how realistic these predictions are and if
there are better opportunities for renewable energy? 

Thanks,

Message-ID: <836F6D678B1E1C47AF83FC6DE4909BD169D686@email.tees.tamus.edu>

FYI. 

Whatever package you use, gaining the type of experience needed to do a reliable job usually takes 2 to 5 years. Especially with "custom" systems that are not easily modeled with fixed schematic programs. 

In addition, one should know what the programs is doing. All too often there are posts to the different sites where it is clear the user does no want to take the time to read the manual. 

At our university we teach DOE-2 from the BDL. This takes a whole semester to cover all commands. After the student takes the class, I'm told it takes them another year or two to build a library of their own files that they ca use to assemble an input. EQUEST is then the program of choice by the students as it is based on DOE-2. In the future we will be teaching EP. 

Using any GUI or REVIT is one or two levels above the basic code. This can be very tempting -- but it requires the user to do their own checking to see if the outputs make sense. Obviously, having on-line help is useful but it cannot replace experience. 

All too often I see posts where someone says that this is their first time to simulate something...this is good...and I applaud anyone who tries to learn this on their own. 

But a reasonable person must ask would you want your heart surgeon to be operating for the first time on you? 

Certainly, any paid simulation job should also be approached with similar respect...these are just calculations, based on algorithms and assumed configurations. If you can't tell what is being simulated, then you're better off using a spreadsheet or rule of thumb. 

Finally, any simulation should be reviewed by another knowledgable person who makes the original coder explain what they are doing, check answers, etc., and the performance of the building monitored (as budget allows) to see how the simulation performed.

hi,

 we are planning to use EQUEST or TRACE 700 for energy simulation. 

 Is eQUEST an approved software by USGBC (in Texas)?

Where can we get training in DFW (Dallas Fort Worth) area?

 Which one is easier, faster? Trace 700 or eQUEST?

or do you know other simulation software (preferable free) that we can
utilize in our LEED design projects and we can get training in DFW area?

thanks

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Chilled Beams
Message-ID: <20071231195726.1B263FE9A@che.dreamhost.com>

Greetings Everyone, and Happy New Year.

 

I'd like to revive a discussion on Chilled Beams from 2006 from the BLDG-SIM
archives to see if anyone has had some additional insights into the modeling
problems involved.  I've reprinted (one of) the relevant threads below.

 

I'm currently modeling a building in eQuest that has active chilled beams as
an alternate.  To summarize my understanding of the prior consensus:

1)     The chilled beams can be modeled as either a PIU OR FCU system.

2)     Use OA-FROM-SYSTEM to pass the required outside air to individual
room, specifying a central dedicated ventilation air handler.

3)     Check SSN reports to make sure that there's no condensation on the
chilled beams.

4)     Check turndown ratio and match induction rate to the profile of the
beam.

 

Some questions -

One person said the induction ratio doesn't really matter.  It this true?

Items 3) and 4) below from Graham Carter, it would be really helpful if
those comments were fleshed out a bit more.  I would assume that this would
entail making a set of dummy spaces that have the latent loads of the actual
spaces.  Would these be attached to the chilled beams system, or to the
"ventilation only" air handler?

 

Thanks,

Steven

This is a good discussion, I am glad others are trying to find work arounds
as the humidity control and central heating aspects are not straight
forward.

I am not fmailiar with the fan energy problems, but I am familiar with the
following:

 

1) There is a lower limit on CHW DT across the chiller which I believe is
6DegF.

 

2) The OA-FROM-SYSTEM is the way to go in EQuest/2.2.  TAS, Apache and I
suspect other programs allow the heating / humidity control to be handled
more easily and accurtely but fall down on the waterside.

 

3) The OA-FROM-SYSTEM cannot 'see' the zones you are passing the air to so
therefore off-coil temperatures cannot be directly controlled from the zone
unless you replicate a dummy building that mimics your actual model's latent
loads etc.

 

4) Further to #3 the OA-FROM-SYSTEM cannot see the zone heating demands thus
space heating must be local by baseboards or by a 4-pipe IU/FCU.

 

5) Given above I have tended to se up my OA-FROM-SYSTEM as a SZRH system
with the cooling coil off-coil controlling to an outdoor air reset schedule
to dehumidify and the zone heating coils reheating to maintain a minimum
zone supply temperature (nominally 15C).  In Australia we use this
configuration as we have warm to hot and humid climates with a small heating
load in comparison to most North American climates.  In winter the central
heating coil (zone coil in this case on a SZRH) would heat to satisfy zone
of greatest heating demand and other zones would recool.  Reheat and recool
sounds inefficient but when the heating is done with CW heat recovery and
periods of simultaneous heating and cooling are in cooler months when plant
effcieincy is at a maximum, the whole system is actually quite efficient.

 

6) I then iterate on the outdoor air reset schedule and observe humidity
levels in key zones to satisfy myself that I am getting space dewpoint
control.

 

7) Ultimately with a chilled beam system that is most sensitive to space
dewpoint control this is still only a good approximation that is time
consuming to ensure it is right.

 

I mentioned last week that the EQuest/2.2 team could fix this up (IU system
with no OA-FROM-SYSTEM, dewpoint contrl and central heaing / reheat) if the
$ could be found - keep in mind we enjoy freeware.  Speaking with Jeff
Hirsch over the years we aren't talking a lot of money but it is too much
for me to justify paying 100%.  Anyone feeling generous or like me,
frustrated at the time consuming work arounds, please contat Jeff and/or
myself as this enhancement would extend the application of EQuest/2.2
dramatically (from my point of view).

Graham Carter

Eric,

 

As Peter stated, an induction unit can have a dedicated system supply source
(for Trace it is OA; for eQUEST/DOE-2 you specify source...OA or rom a
chosen AHU).  The same is true with the fan coil unit.  

 

For DOE-2.2/eQUEST specifically, there are a few of snags that one runs
into.  One, the induction ratio doesn't really matter...play around and
you'll see.  Two, DOE-2 doesn't seem to account for the fan energy used to
pull off the CFM that goes to the beams...I'd love for someone to prove I'm
wrong.  Three, I've had difficulties with loop temperatures and delta T for
the loops...i.e. DOE-2 didn't seem to like the higher water temps going to
the IU/FCU.  I'd like to hear feedback if someone else got around this.

Trace had some similar drawbacks...I'll work on recalling them.

 

Paul

OK so you are talking about an active beam and not a static beam, right.
Then you need an outside air supply to be incorprated into the conditioning
system, so I guess the induction unit will suffice, just check the minmum
turndown ratio and check the induction rate to match the profile of the
active beam.

Thanks for your inputs.  How about the air which is induced into the beams?
For example, I supply only 105 CFM per beam, but I will have around 300 CFM
total supply air.

Very simple. Model the chilled beam as a fan coil for cooling only and
remove the associated fan power.

Greetings

 

I am seeking for any suggestions or input on the model of active chilled
beam system.   In my previous Trace model, it can not handle it very well by
induction system.  I am very curious to get inputs and helps from other
folks.   Thanks in advance.

Robert,

 

The energy plus site has an EPW file (energyplus weather file format)
generated from IWEC data that appears to be an average, but does not specify
the exact number of years.


International Weather for Energy Calculations (IWEC)


The IWEC are the result of ASHRAE Research Project 1015 by Numerical Logics
and Bodycote Materials Testing Canada for ASHRAE Technical Committee 4.2
Weather Information. The IWEC data files are 'typical' weather files
suitable for use with building energy simulation programs for 227 locations
outside the USA and Canada. All 227 locations in the IWEC data set are
available for download in EnergyPlus weather format.

The files are derived from up to 18 years of DATSAV3 hourly weather data
originally archived at the U. S. National Climatic Data Center. The weather
data is supplemented by solar radiation estimated on an hourly basis from
earth-sun geometry and hourly weather elements, particularly cloud amount
information. The IWEC CD-ROM is available from ASHRAE
<http://resourcecenter.ashrae.org/store/ashrae/> . The reference for the
IWEC is:
