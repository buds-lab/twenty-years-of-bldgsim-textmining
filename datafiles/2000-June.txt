Hello group

Does anyone know what building simulation programs have been developed
and/or are utilized for Commercial buildings in Japan?  I am particularly
interested in their state of sophistication with regard to computer
simulation of building energy use?  I am particularly interested in programs
that might be used for measurement and verification (M&V) work, i.e. their
capabilities for calibrating computer simulations to actual bills.

Any information would be greatly appreciated!

Bob

"reclaimed". Does anyone know of this?

Two other sites also have good information on building codes:
http://www.buildingteam.com
http://www.myFacilities.com

MEC and IECC can both be purchased on-line and you may be able to find copies in
a local technical bookstore.  The buildingteam.com site has building code
officials and contact information listed for most US cities and counties.  Since
MEC and IECC are model codes that may be amended by the local jurisdiction, it
may be best to contact the local AHJ (authority having jurisdiction -- code
legalese) if you have a particular issue.

Thank you very much! I will let you know if it works.


an aside:
My thanks to the list in general.
The BLDG-SIM list is one of the most helpful, and apparently widely read,

I believe it is a great service to our profession, as well as a valuable

  Mr. Case,
  I have a TRY file for Rota, which I obtained five years ago from
ERG/ACROSOFT International, Inc. (they sold me MICRO-DOE2, a PC
implementation of DOE-2.1E). I never used this file and I can not assure its
integrity. I am sending you this file (Rota.dat) which must be packed using
the DOE-2 weather processor. To execute the weather preocessor, you must
supply an input file (Input.tmp) that I am also sending you.

  Alternatively, I suggest that you contact Luis Fernando Zarzalejo
(lf.zarzalejo at ciemat.es) at CIEMAT (www.ciemat.es), Madrid. Maybe he can
help you.

Hi Farraji,

there are different approaches to this in TRNSYS, each with 
different advantages/drawbacks. The enclosed slides from 
our TRNSYS course summarize the most frequently used 
solutions.  

A variation of using the boundary wall method with modified 
ground temperature is to calculate the ground temperature 
with Jeff Thornton's Type 164 (or with some user-defined 
equation). See also the TESS website for more information 
about the non-standard types: http://www.tess-inc.com/  

(Type 164 is on this page: http://www.tess-
inc.com/tess/trnsys/tessutil.htm)  

Hope this helps,

Werner

Bob,

The CREST web site has information from the "Building Codes Assistance
Project" which lists the status of various codes by state.  It is my
understanding that the IECC either has or will supercede the MEC across the
board.  The web site below provides the newsletter that gives the updates on
state codes including MEC and IECC.  According to the site, New York has a
state developed code that nominally meets ASHRAE 90.1-1989.

As a general note, the CREST web site is being shut down in July and will
re-emerge later under a difference moniker.  I would go there asap if you
need the information.

I hope this helps,

Mahabir,

What version of DOE-2.1E are you using? You should contact
whoever you got the program from about the sample input/output
files that are available for the program. There is also a
"Sample Run Book" as part of the documentation. Both the files
and the book illustrate many different system and plant types.

Also, you may want to contact the DOE-2 Resource Center for India:
Jiten Prajapati or Anil Anand, Energy Systems Engineering, IIT Mumbai,
Powai, Mumbai 400 076, Tel: 91 022 578 2545 x7378. They have complete
sets of DOE-2.1E documentation, technical reports, etc.

We publish (on the web) a bi-monthly Building Energy Simulation User News
that lists DOE-2 services, documentation sources, program vendors, etc.
(as well as information on related simulation tools). To subscribe go to
http://SimulationResearch.lbl.gov and click on User News, Subscribe.
Back issues of the User News are available at this web site.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Request for help simulating a reservoir
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200006081043.AA434770MD41720@gard.com>

I am trying to simulate a 78 600 gallon reservoir for a water loop heat pump
system in DOE-2.1E. I want to operate the reservoir to store energy during
off-peak hours (between the hours of 22 and 7) for cooling and heating
purposes. The heat will be supplied by an electric boiler and the cooling
supplied by a water tower. I am having trouble with the PLANT portion of the
simulation (ie. the SYSTEMS component runs optimally but when the loads are
carried over to the PLANT, the peak power demand is much too high). I think
the problem lies in the boiler: the boiler seems to be trying to warm the
reservoir instantaneously, drawing far too much power.

If someone has simulated a similar reservoir and could guide me through the
process, it would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,

Mike,

The DOE-2.1e program can simulate all of the systems that 
you described.  Combining electric centrifugal and direct 
fired absorption chillers in a single plant with controls I 
have done many times and it works well.  The chillers can 
be sequenced in a variety of ways to meet the load and the 
sequencing can be modified hourly by schedules.   

All three items are well documented in the "DOE-2 
Supplement Version 2.1e" by Winkelmann, et al, November 
1993 and comes with the DOE-2 documentation package.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200006030212.AA124196MD40651@gard.com>

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

GeoPraxis Publishes First XML Schema for Building Energy and Environmental
Performance Analysis
Open ?Green Building XML? Schema Now Available


SONOMA, CA --(BUSINESS WIRE)-- June 2, 2000 -- Keeping to a schedule set
last month, GeoPraxis, Inc., the leading provider of XML-based energy and
environmental analysis software today published an open XML schema that will
greatly facilitate the analysis of building energy and environmental
performance by architects, engineers, and others who design and build
buildings.

The new schema, Green Building XML (gbXML), will facilitate the transfer of
building product characteristics and equipment performance data between
manufacturer?s databases, CAD applications, and energy simulation engines.
The gbXML schema is poised to become the interoperability standard for
sharing data between programs of this type.  Improved data interoperability
between the desktop and web-based tools currently used in the architecture,
engineering, and construction (A/E/C) industry will greatly reduce the time
and cost of designing high performance, energy and resource efficient
buildings.

John Kennedy, Principal and head of software development at GeoPraxis, said,
?After public review by 45 representatives from industry, research, and
media organizations, V1.0 of the schema has been completed and submitted to
the BizTalk and IAI/aecXML organizations.  We are thankful for the many
comments and words of encouragement we received during the review process
and look forward to working with many of these parties to make the vision of
truly useful building performance analysis tools become a reality.?

Mr. Kennedy has been invited to discuss the schema and demonstrate it in
action at three upcoming venues: a workshop at Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory (June 16), the International Alliance for Interoperability?s
aecXML/IFC meeting held in conjunction with the Construction Specifications
Institute annual convention in Atlanta  (June 23), and the International
Building Performance Simulation Association (IBPSA) semiannual meeting in
Minneapolis (June 24).

?Building performance analysis is a hot topic right now and gbXML appears to
be the best way to get powerful building performance simulation capabilities
into the hands of new users as quickly as possible", said Duane Barrett,
Product Manager, HVAC Applications at Bentley Systems, Incorporated.

GbXML V1.0 is fully compatible with the most recent revisions of the aecXML
guidelines and the BizTalk framework.  Developers and others who wish to
download the schema may do so immediately via www.BizTalk.org or visit
www.idea-server.com/gbXML.htm.
