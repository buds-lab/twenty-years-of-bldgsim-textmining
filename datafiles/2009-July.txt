Christina,

Simulation lab that performed simulations would have frame U-factors.  
NFRC staff would not be able to give you frame U-factors but could 
potentially direct you to the sim lab that modeled these windows.  
Alternatively, try to pry that info from Serious Windows. 

BTW, NFRC is finalizing new certification process, called Component 
Modeling Approach, where performance of framing, glazing and spacers is 
published separately, as well as whole product performance and 
EnergyPlus file for those that want to use info for building energy sim.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Low-flow Fixtures and LEED
Message-ID: <00ac01c9fa66$3de51000$b9af3000$@com>

Based on a LEED CIR dated 4/25/2007 (see below) domestic hot water savings
cannot be claimed for the use of low-flow plumbing fixtures, even though
Appendix G addendum a specifically states that credit may be taken through
calculations.   Have there been any changes to LEED review methodology
since this CIR was released that allows credit to be taken?  Previously we
have taken credit for low-flow fixtures and it has been accepted by the
reviewer, but have recently come across this CIR which seems to state
otherwise.

 

The reasoning behind not allowing it doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
Water efficiency and energy efficiency are two separate animals, and
getting credits under WEc3 Water Use Reduction does not equate to getting
energy efficiency credit under EAc1.  It's not like this would be the
first time LEED has allowed double dipping (EAc2 Renewable Energy is
allowed to be used under EAc1 as well).

 

Is there a legitimate way to take credit for the energy reduction of
low-flow fixtures for LEED?

Forgot to put the CIR in.  Also, I'm just realizing that at the bottom of
the CIR it states that addenda have now been approved for use in LEED.
Wouldn't this invalidate #9, as Appendix G addenda a allows for the use of
low-flow fixtures?

 

"4/25/2007 -  Credit Interpretation Request
The adoption of Appendix G under LEED 2.2 raises all sorts of interesting
questions with respect to the energy modeling protocol. 

Please clarify for us and the world of LEED users out there the following:

1. Appendix G Addendum a
Would USGBC for LEED 2.2 adopt the published Addendum a to 90.1-2004
Appendix G which changes a number of areas?

2. Building Orientation
May we choose to not implement in our baseline model ASHRAE 90.1-2004
Appendix G Table G3.1 5. (a) orientation rotation which requires rotating
the model to 4 cardinal directions, and averaging the results. For our
project, orientation with the long axis of the building East-West was not
optional. 

3. Baseline Fenestration Area and Location
Would the USGBC eliminate the provision under ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G
Table G3.1 Baseline 5.(c) that requires dividing out the entire design
window area, up to the 40% maximum window to wall ratio, and defining it
as horizontal bands with average window to wall area on all facings and
floors? This change is also proposed under Addendum a to 90.-2004. The
addendum references the section numbering from an earlier version of the
Standard prior to the creation of Table G3.1 in the current version of the
Standard. 

4. Residential Designed Lighting Baseline
Will USGBC for LEED 2.2 adopt the same rules adopted under LEED 2.1 CIR
rulings that established a residential lighting baseline, for designed
fixed lighting? ASHRAE 90.1-2004 still treats residential living area
lighting as exempt (9.1.1 Exception b), and Appendix G does not define a
baseline for this lighting. The rulings defined a process of mapping from
the designed lighting to baseline lighting with conventional incandescent
lighting, with a maximum baseline lighting power density of 2.0 W/s.f. The
rulings also established a 750 hour full load equivalent operating
schedule to be the same in design and baseline. 

5. Residential Receptacle Lighting
Will USGBC for LEED 2.2 accept 90.1 Addendum a) change to table G3.1
Design 6 (d) so that receptable lighting energy usage is not subtracted
out from the design and baseline models. This is an inconsistency the
addendum corrects, and is the only case where non-regulated energy is not
counted under the new standard. 

6. Lighting Controls
Will USGBC for LEED 2.2. allow Exceptional Calculations regarding energy
savings for occupancy sensor and time-of-day controls that exceed ASHRAE
90.1 code requirements that are greater than the Appendix G Table G3.2.
For example, LEED 2.1 rulings appeared to allow greater than 10% allowed
by Appendix G for occupancy sensors controlling normally 24 hour interior
stair lighting in a multi-family high-rise that would be occupied only a
small fraction of the time. 

7. Exterior Lighting
Will USGBC for LEED 2.2 allow credit for exterior lighting that is more
efficient than the new mandatory provision for exterior lighting in
90.1-2004 section 9.4. Appendix G does not address how exterior lighting
should be modeled for the baseline, and therefore the default is that it
should be modeled the same as the design and no credit for savings could
be taken. 

8. Residential Appliances and Exhaust Fans
Will USGBC for LEED 2.2. allow for Energy Star rated appliances and
exhaust fans an Exceptional Calculation approach (similar to previous LEED
2.1 rulings for an appliance ID credit) to calculate energy cost savings
for EAc1? Exceptional calculation would be based on Energy Star data to
define design and baseline energy usage? 

9. DHW Usage Reduction
Will USGBC for LEED 2.2. allow the approach to claim domestic hot water
energy cost reduction based on low flow fixtures, relative to EPACT
standard allowed fixture flows from earlier LEED 2.1 rulings. Another
approach would be to adopt 90.1-2004 addendum a) revision to Table 3.1
Baseline 11. labeled as a revision to G4.3 under the older numbering
convention. 

10. Heat Recovery from Condenser Loop
Will USGBC for LEED 2.2 allow the baseline adjustment for heat recovery
from condenser loops to DHW as required in section 6.5.6.2 to be done with
assistance of spreadsheet analysis outside of the model, or will the
provision at Appendix G Table 3.1 Baseline 11 (f) exception that requires
the proposed design to actually include the heat recovery equipment in the
real building, if the modeling software cannot model it. The design
feature cannot be modeled under DOE-2.2 and its interface eQuest, one of
the most widely used and otherwise versatile programs. This provision, if
enforced, requires a significant expense for the project that may not be
cost effective compared to alternatives. This would be a penalty on the
subset of projects that fall under the rules at 6.5.6.2. Normally, the
design does not have to meet the prescriptive requirements of ASHRAE, but
is allowed to make trade-offs to achieve overall energy cost savings. 

11. Solar Hot Water-Clarify Eligibility for EAc1&2
Will USGBC state that solar hot water generation, that does not generate
any electricity is eligible for credit under EAc1 and EAc2? Requirements
language paragraph 1 for EAc2 does not state if energy generated from a
renewable source is electric or thermal, although other parts of the
chapter allow for solar hot water, but the second paragraph refers to a
method to just estimate electricity generation. Just want to be sure there
is no question that solar hot water generation is eligible for both
EAc1&2. 
  4/25/2007 -  Ruling
[REVISED 10/30/07 to allow energy savings for exterior lighting.]

1. No. Since multiple projects are already in process and the LEED-NC v2.2
Reference Guide specifically mentions that ASHRAE 90.1-2004 is applicable
without addenda; any addenda not included in the completed standard will
not be accepted at this time.

2. No. The Appendix G method of distributing the glazing equally on all
orientations normalizes this issue. The question raised by Appendix G is -
Is your building designed to respond to the specific solar orientation?

3. No. See points 1 and 2 above.

4. Yes. The calculation methodology should be considered equivalent for
LEED-NC v2.2.

5. The LEED modeling protocol addresses this issue by setting the process
load as 25% of total energy by default, unless it is a process dominated
building. For a typical residential building, process loads will never be
above 25% and therefore should not be an issue.

6. Exceptional Calculation for any measure that is not accounted for in
the modeling protocol is accepted on a case-by-case basis.

7. Yes, project teams can take credit for efficient exterior lighting
within ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G. Credit may only be taken for the tradable
surfaces listed in ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Table 9.4.5. All other exterior
lighting must be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case.
The Baseline case exterior lighting power allowance should be calculated
using the methodology outline in Section 9.4.5. 

8. Yes. Page 184 of the LEED-NC v2.2 Reference Guide describes Exceptional
Calculations for residential appliances.

9. No. Credit for saving water is already granted in the Water Efficiency
section of the LEED Rating System. The Domestic Hot Water (DHW) loop will
be sized for design flows and the PRM does not allow credit for changing
loop flows for DHW.

10. No. The requirements for the loop sizing have been set in Appendix G
and to maintain integrity of the modeling protocol, such exceptions cannot
be taken. 

11. Yes. On-site energy generated can be taken credit for using the
Exceptional Calculations under EAc1, Optimize Energy Performance, and as
percent of total energy for EAc2, On-Site Renewable Energy.


Note: ASHRAE Addenda have been approved for use in LEED projects, as
stated on our website: http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=2664"

Thanks for pointing that out Robby.  You are correct DHW savings can be
counted under EAc1.  As a review firm we have always granted such savings.
As a member of the EA TAG I will ask staff to correct the CIR you

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Low-flow Fixtures and LEED

 

Based on a LEED CIR dated 4/25/2007 (see below) domestic hot water savings
cannot be claimed for the use of low-flow plumbing fixtures, even though
Appendix G addendum a specifically states that credit may be taken through
calculations.   Have there been any changes to LEED review methodology since
this CIR was released that allows credit to be taken?  Previously we have
taken credit for low-flow fixtures and it has been accepted by the reviewer,
but have recently come across this CIR which seems to state otherwise.

 

The reasoning behind not allowing it doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
Water efficiency and energy efficiency are two separate animals, and getting
credits under WEc3 Water Use Reduction does not equate to getting energy
efficiency credit under EAc1.  It's not like this would be the first time
LEED has allowed double dipping (EAc2 Renewable Energy is allowed to be used
under EAc1 as well).

 

Is there a legitimate way to take credit for the energy reduction of
low-flow fixtures for LEED?

Thanks Marcus,

 

Could you also recommend LEED NCv2.2 CIR dated 6/30/2009 be updated as
well?  This CIR also discusses that only non-regulated water use can be
taken credit for under EAc1.

Thanks for pointing that out Robby.  You are correct DHW savings can be
counted under EAc1.  As a review firm we have always granted such savings.
As a member of the EA TAG I will ask staff to correct the CIR you

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Low-flow Fixtures and LEED

 

Forgot to put the CIR in.  Also, I'm just realizing that at the bottom of
the CIR it states that addenda have now been approved for use in LEED.
Wouldn't this invalidate #9, as Appendix G addenda a allows for the use of
low-flow fixtures?

 

"4/25/2007 -  Credit Interpretation Request
The adoption of Appendix G under LEED 2.2 raises all sorts of interesting
questions with respect to the energy modeling protocol. 

Please clarify for us and the world of LEED users out there the following:

1. Appendix G Addendum a
Would USGBC for LEED 2.2 adopt the published Addendum a to 90.1-2004
Appendix G which changes a number of areas?

2. Building Orientation
May we choose to not implement in our baseline model ASHRAE 90.1-2004
Appendix G Table G3.1 5. (a) orientation rotation which requires rotating
the model to 4 cardinal directions, and averaging the results. For our
project, orientation with the long axis of the building East-West was not
optional. 

3. Baseline Fenestration Area and Location
Would the USGBC eliminate the provision under ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G
Table G3.1 Baseline 5.(c) that requires dividing out the entire design
window area, up to the 40% maximum window to wall ratio, and defining it
as horizontal bands with average window to wall area on all facings and
floors? This change is also proposed under Addendum a to 90.-2004. The
addendum references the section numbering from an earlier version of the
Standard prior to the creation of Table G3.1 in the current version of the
Standard. 

4. Residential Designed Lighting Baseline
Will USGBC for LEED 2.2 adopt the same rules adopted under LEED 2.1 CIR
rulings that established a residential lighting baseline, for designed
fixed lighting? ASHRAE 90.1-2004 still treats residential living area
lighting as exempt (9.1.1 Exception b), and Appendix G does not define a
baseline for this lighting. The rulings defined a process of mapping from
the designed lighting to baseline lighting with conventional incandescent
lighting, with a maximum baseline lighting power density of 2.0 W/s.f. The
rulings also established a 750 hour full load equivalent operating
schedule to be the same in design and baseline. 

5. Residential Receptacle Lighting
Will USGBC for LEED 2.2 accept 90.1 Addendum a) change to table G3.1
Design 6 (d) so that receptable lighting energy usage is not subtracted
out from the design and baseline models. This is an inconsistency the
addendum corrects, and is the only case where non-regulated energy is not
counted under the new standard. 

6. Lighting Controls
Will USGBC for LEED 2.2. allow Exceptional Calculations regarding energy
savings for occupancy sensor and time-of-day controls that exceed ASHRAE
90.1 code requirements that are greater than the Appendix G Table G3.2.
For example, LEED 2.1 rulings appeared to allow greater than 10% allowed
by Appendix G for occupancy sensors controlling normally 24 hour interior
stair lighting in a multi-family high-rise that would be occupied only a
small fraction of the time. 

7. Exterior Lighting
Will USGBC for LEED 2.2 allow credit for exterior lighting that is more
efficient than the new mandatory provision for exterior lighting in
90.1-2004 section 9.4. Appendix G does not address how exterior lighting
should be modeled for the baseline, and therefore the default is that it
should be modeled the same as the design and no credit for savings could
be taken. 

8. Residential Appliances and Exhaust Fans
Will USGBC for LEED 2.2. allow for Energy Star rated appliances and
exhaust fans an Exceptional Calculation approach (similar to previous LEED
2.1 rulings for an appliance ID credit) to calculate energy cost savings
for EAc1? Exceptional calculation would be based on Energy Star data to
define design and baseline energy usage? 

9. DHW Usage Reduction
Will USGBC for LEED 2.2. allow the approach to claim domestic hot water
energy cost reduction based on low flow fixtures, relative to EPACT
standard allowed fixture flows from earlier LEED 2.1 rulings. Another
approach would be to adopt 90.1-2004 addendum a) revision to Table 3.1
Baseline 11. labeled as a revision to G4.3 under the older numbering
convention. 

10. Heat Recovery from Condenser Loop
Will USGBC for LEED 2.2 allow the baseline adjustment for heat recovery
from condenser loops to DHW as required in section 6.5.6.2 to be done with
assistance of spreadsheet analysis outside of the model, or will the
provision at Appendix G Table 3.1 Baseline 11 (f) exception that requires
the proposed design to actually include the heat recovery equipment in the
real building, if the modeling software cannot model it. The design
feature cannot be modeled under DOE-2.2 and its interface eQuest, one of
the most widely used and otherwise versatile programs. This provision, if
enforced, requires a significant expense for the project that may not be
cost effective compared to alternatives. This would be a penalty on the
subset of projects that fall under the rules at 6.5.6.2. Normally, the
design does not have to meet the prescriptive requirements of ASHRAE, but
is allowed to make trade-offs to achieve overall energy cost savings. 

11. Solar Hot Water-Clarify Eligibility for EAc1&2
Will USGBC state that solar hot water generation, that does not generate
any electricity is eligible for credit under EAc1 and EAc2? Requirements
language paragraph 1 for EAc2 does not state if energy generated from a
renewable source is electric or thermal, although other parts of the
chapter allow for solar hot water, but the second paragraph refers to a
method to just estimate electricity generation. Just want to be sure there
is no question that solar hot water generation is eligible for both
EAc1&2. 
  4/25/2007 -  Ruling
[REVISED 10/30/07 to allow energy savings for exterior lighting.]

1. No. Since multiple projects are already in process and the LEED-NC v2.2
Reference Guide specifically mentions that ASHRAE 90.1-2004 is applicable
without addenda; any addenda not included in the completed standard will
not be accepted at this time.

2. No. The Appendix G method of distributing the glazing equally on all
orientations normalizes this issue. The question raised by Appendix G is -
Is your building designed to respond to the specific solar orientation?

3. No. See points 1 and 2 above.

4. Yes. The calculation methodology should be considered equivalent for
LEED-NC v2.2.

5. The LEED modeling protocol addresses this issue by setting the process
load as 25% of total energy by default, unless it is a process dominated
building. For a typical residential building, process loads will never be
above 25% and therefore should not be an issue.

6. Exceptional Calculation for any measure that is not accounted for in
the modeling protocol is accepted on a case-by-case basis.

7. Yes, project teams can take credit for efficient exterior lighting
within ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G. Credit may only be taken for the tradable
surfaces listed in ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Table 9.4.5. All other exterior
lighting must be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case.
The Baseline case exterior lighting power allowance should be calculated
using the methodology outline in Section 9.4.5. 

8. Yes. Page 184 of the LEED-NC v2.2 Reference Guide describes Exceptional
Calculations for residential appliances.

9. No. Credit for saving water is already granted in the Water Efficiency
section of the LEED Rating System. The Domestic Hot Water (DHW) loop will
be sized for design flows and the PRM does not allow credit for changing
loop flows for DHW.

10. No. The requirements for the loop sizing have been set in Appendix G
and to maintain integrity of the modeling protocol, such exceptions cannot
be taken. 

11. Yes. On-site energy generated can be taken credit for using the
Exceptional Calculations under EAc1, Optimize Energy Performance, and as
percent of total energy for EAc2, On-Site Renewable Energy.

Is there a standard for how the savings will be calculated?  The CIR requests that the savings be relative to WEc3, but many of the fixtures contributing to savings in WEc3 do not involve hot water (flush fixtures) and many use hot water only sporadically (lavatories, kitchen sinks, janitor sinks).  I always assumed that was a large part of the reasoning behind not allowing DHW savings.

You can use the proposed gallons under flow fixtures divided by the
baseline gallons under flow fixtures to calculate a percent savings to
adjust your DHW flow by.  This is only really accurate if you don't have
other hot water process loads in your building like laundry and clothes
washers, in which case you should account for it in another fashion.  

 

The New York Energy Smart Simulation Guidelines for multifamily projects
has a good system developed for domestic hot water savings with clothes
washers and laundries included.

Subject: RE: [Bldg-sim] Low-flow Fixtures and LEED

 

Is there a standard for how the savings will be calculated?  The CIR
requests that the savings be relative to WEc3, but many of the fixtures
contributing to savings in WEc3 do not involve hot water (flush fixtures)
and many use hot water only sporadically (lavatories, kitchen sinks,
janitor sinks).  I always assumed that was a large part of the reasoning
behind not allowing DHW savings.

Thanks for pointing that out Robby.  You are correct DHW savings can be
counted under EAc1.  As a review firm we have always granted such savings.
As a member of the EA TAG I will ask staff to correct the CIR you
referenced.

Forgot to put the CIR in.  Also, I'm just realizing that at the bottom of
the CIR it states that addenda have now been approved for use in LEED.
Wouldn't this invalidate #9, as Appendix G addenda a allows for the use of
low-flow fixtures?

 

"4/25/2007 -  Credit Interpretation Request
The adoption of Appendix G under LEED 2.2 raises all sorts of interesting
questions with respect to the energy modeling protocol. 

Please clarify for us and the world of LEED users out there the following:

1. Appendix G Addendum a
Would USGBC for LEED 2.2 adopt the published Addendum a to 90.1-2004
Appendix G which changes a number of areas?

2. Building Orientation
May we choose to not implement in our baseline model ASHRAE 90.1-2004
Appendix G Table G3.1 5. (a) orientation rotation which requires rotating
the model to 4 cardinal directions, and averaging the results. For our
project, orientation with the long axis of the building East-West was not
optional. 

3. Baseline Fenestration Area and Location
Would the USGBC eliminate the provision under ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G
Table G3.1 Baseline 5.(c) that requires dividing out the entire design
window area, up to the 40% maximum window to wall ratio, and defining it
as horizontal bands with average window to wall area on all facings and
floors? This change is also proposed under Addendum a to 90.-2004. The
addendum references the section numbering from an earlier version of the
Standard prior to the creation of Table G3.1 in the current version of the
Standard. 

4. Residential Designed Lighting Baseline
Will USGBC for LEED 2.2 adopt the same rules adopted under LEED 2.1 CIR
rulings that established a residential lighting baseline, for designed
fixed lighting? ASHRAE 90.1-2004 still treats residential living area
lighting as exempt (9.1.1 Exception b), and Appendix G does not define a
baseline for this lighting. The rulings defined a process of mapping from
the designed lighting to baseline lighting with conventional incandescent
lighting, with a maximum baseline lighting power density of 2.0 W/s.f. The
rulings also established a 750 hour full load equivalent operating
schedule to be the same in design and baseline. 

5. Residential Receptacle Lighting
Will USGBC for LEED 2.2 accept 90.1 Addendum a) change to table G3.1
Design 6 (d) so that receptable lighting energy usage is not subtracted
out from the design and baseline models. This is an inconsistency the
addendum corrects, and is the only case where non-regulated energy is not
counted under the new standard. 

6. Lighting Controls
Will USGBC for LEED 2.2. allow Exceptional Calculations regarding energy
savings for occupancy sensor and time-of-day controls that exceed ASHRAE
90.1 code requirements that are greater than the Appendix G Table G3.2.
For example, LEED 2.1 rulings appeared to allow greater than 10% allowed
by Appendix G for occupancy sensors controlling normally 24 hour interior
stair lighting in a multi-family high-rise that would be occupied only a
small fraction of the time. 

7. Exterior Lighting
Will USGBC for LEED 2.2 allow credit for exterior lighting that is more
efficient than the new mandatory provision for exterior lighting in
90.1-2004 section 9.4. Appendix G does not address how exterior lighting
should be modeled for the baseline, and therefore the default is that it
should be modeled the same as the design and no credit for savings could
be taken. 

8. Residential Appliances and Exhaust Fans
Will USGBC for LEED 2.2. allow for Energy Star rated appliances and
exhaust fans an Exceptional Calculation approach (similar to previous LEED
2.1 rulings for an appliance ID credit) to calculate energy cost savings
for EAc1? Exceptional calculation would be based on Energy Star data to
define design and baseline energy usage? 

9. DHW Usage Reduction
Will USGBC for LEED 2.2. allow the approach to claim domestic hot water
energy cost reduction based on low flow fixtures, relative to EPACT
standard allowed fixture flows from earlier LEED 2.1 rulings. Another
approach would be to adopt 90.1-2004 addendum a) revision to Table 3.1
Baseline 11. labeled as a revision to G4.3 under the older numbering
convention. 

10. Heat Recovery from Condenser Loop
Will USGBC for LEED 2.2 allow the baseline adjustment for heat recovery
from condenser loops to DHW as required in section 6.5.6.2 to be done with
assistance of spreadsheet analysis outside of the model, or will the
provision at Appendix G Table 3.1 Baseline 11 (f) exception that requires
the proposed design to actually include the heat recovery equipment in the
real building, if the modeling software cannot model it. The design
feature cannot be modeled under DOE-2.2 and its interface eQuest, one of
the most widely used and otherwise versatile programs. This provision, if
enforced, requires a significant expense for the project that may not be
cost effective compared to alternatives. This would be a penalty on the
subset of projects that fall under the rules at 6.5.6.2. Normally, the
design does not have to meet the prescriptive requirements of ASHRAE, but
is allowed to make trade-offs to achieve overall energy cost savings. 

11. Solar Hot Water-Clarify Eligibility for EAc1&2
Will USGBC state that solar hot water generation, that does not generate
any electricity is eligible for credit under EAc1 and EAc2? Requirements
language paragraph 1 for EAc2 does not state if energy generated from a
renewable source is electric or thermal, although other parts of the
chapter allow for solar hot water, but the second paragraph refers to a
method to just estimate electricity generation. Just want to be sure there
is no question that solar hot water generation is eligible for both
EAc1&2. 
  4/25/2007 -  Ruling
[REVISED 10/30/07 to allow energy savings for exterior lighting.]

1. No. Since multiple projects are already in process and the LEED-NC v2.2
Reference Guide specifically mentions that ASHRAE 90.1-2004 is applicable
without addenda; any addenda not included in the completed standard will
not be accepted at this time.

2. No. The Appendix G method of distributing the glazing equally on all
orientations normalizes this issue. The question raised by Appendix G is -
Is your building designed to respond to the specific solar orientation?

3. No. See points 1 and 2 above.

4. Yes. The calculation methodology should be considered equivalent for
LEED-NC v2.2.

5. The LEED modeling protocol addresses this issue by setting the process
load as 25% of total energy by default, unless it is a process dominated
building. For a typical residential building, process loads will never be
above 25% and therefore should not be an issue.

6. Exceptional Calculation for any measure that is not accounted for in
the modeling protocol is accepted on a case-by-case basis.

7. Yes, project teams can take credit for efficient exterior lighting
within ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G. Credit may only be taken for the tradable
surfaces listed in ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Table 9.4.5. All other exterior
lighting must be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case.
The Baseline case exterior lighting power allowance should be calculated
using the methodology outline in Section 9.4.5. 

8. Yes. Page 184 of the LEED-NC v2.2 Reference Guide describes Exceptional
Calculations for residential appliances.

9. No. Credit for saving water is already granted in the Water Efficiency
section of the LEED Rating System. The Domestic Hot Water (DHW) loop will
be sized for design flows and the PRM does not allow credit for changing
loop flows for DHW.

10. No. The requirements for the loop sizing have been set in Appendix G
and to maintain integrity of the modeling protocol, such exceptions cannot
be taken. 

11. Yes. On-site energy generated can be taken credit for using the
Exceptional Calculations under EAc1, Optimize Energy Performance, and as
percent of total energy for EAc2, On-Site Renewable Energy.


Note: ASHRAE Addenda have been approved for use in LEED projects, as
stated on our website: http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=2664"

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Low-flow Fixtures and LEED

 

Based on a LEED CIR dated 4/25/2007 (see below) domestic hot water savings
cannot be claimed for the use of low-flow plumbing fixtures, even though
Appendix G addendum a specifically states that credit may be taken through
calculations.   Have there been any changes to LEED review methodology
since this CIR was released that allows credit to be taken?  Previously we
have taken credit for low-flow fixtures and it has been accepted by the
reviewer, but have recently come across this CIR which seems to state
otherwise.

 

The reasoning behind not allowing it doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
Water efficiency and energy efficiency are two separate animals, and
getting credits under WEc3 Water Use Reduction does not equate to getting
energy efficiency credit under EAc1.  It's not like this would be the
first time LEED has allowed double dipping (EAc2 Renewable Energy is
allowed to be used under EAc1 as well).

 

Is there a legitimate way to take credit for the energy reduction of
low-flow fixtures for LEED?

You can only take credit for hot water flow fixtures - I typically only
consider restroom lavatories, showers, and dishwashers (assuming clothes
washers may be run with cold water). I use the following procedure for this,
although I'm sure there are other approaches:


   1. Determine all hot water flow fixtures in projects
   2. Create realistic hourly schedules for each distinct usage (i.e. one
   schedule for lavatories, one for showers, one for dishwashers)
   3. Determine peak and baseline gpm for actual design for each distinct
   usage

So in eQUEST, I have 3 separate process loads with different peak gpms and
schedules.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Appendix G Fan Power
Message-ID: <55BA83825A482144A8637F9CAA981F7613E54817@las-mail.lordaecksargent.internal>

G3.1.2.9 Gives you a formula for calculating system fan electrical power
for supply, return, exhaust and relief. Lets sat I have a zone with a
PSZ-HP that has a supply volume of 1500 cfm. Using this formula along
with table G3.1.2.9 I get a fan horse power of 1.29 and kW of 1.17. This
equates to 0.00078 kW/cfm - which seems really high. 

 

The second part to my question is assuming I have 500cfm of exhaust in
this zone, do I apply the same kW/cfm to the exhaust fans as well as the
return fans? It seems that the lower the fan volume the more inefficient
the Appendix G values get from these tables. 

 

Any guidance would be much appreciated.

You have calculated the kW/cfm correctly according to the 2004 version
of Appendix G. The allowance actually goes up a little in 2007, for your
case. As for the second part of your question, no you do not apply the
same kW/cfm to the exhaust fan. The calculated allowed fan power the
total allowed power for all fans that are part of the system, including
the exhaust fan. The cfm component is based on the supply fan cfm only.
Unfortunately, Appendix G gives no direction on how to divide the
allowed fan power up among the various fans in the system.

The equation is meant for each HVAC system. The example in the User's
manual is probably not a very good one. If it was an 80,000 sf single
story building it would only have one baseline Packaged VAV  system and
the example would be correct. If it were a multi-story building, there
would be one baseline Packaged VAV system for each floor and the example
would be incorrect. 

 

The User's manual is correct that the power of the parallel fan-powered
terminal units in systems 6 and 8 is not included in the calculation.
The power of those fans is specifically called out in G3.1.3.14 at 0.35
W/cfm.

Interesting to hear the request for fan energy delineation in the template.

The old ECB had a largely one to one relationship and Ellen's approach worked.

Appendix G is no longer one to one and that is key to understand.
Section G3.1.1 in its varied & modified versions prescribes single zone or multi-zone  system types and provides constraints on system delineation.

So determine the number, types, sizes of the systems in the baseline model then go back and solve the fan power for each.

You have calculated the kW/cfm correctly according to the 2004 version of Appendix G. The allowance actually goes up a little in 2007, for your case. As for the second part of your question, no you do not apply the same kW/cfm to the exhaust fan. The calculated allowed fan power the total allowed power for all fans that are part of the system, including the exhaust fan. The cfm component is based on the supply fan cfm only. Unfortunately, Appendix G gives no direction on how to divide the allowed fan power up among the various fans in the system.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Appendix G Fan Power

G3.1.2.9 Gives you a formula for calculating system fan electrical power for supply, return, exhaust and relief. Lets sat I have a zone with a PSZ-HP that has a supply volume of 1500 cfm. Using this formula along with table G3.1.2.9 I get a fan horse power of 1.29 and kW of 1.17. This equates to 0.00078 kW/cfm - which seems really high.

The second part to my question is assuming I have 500cfm of exhaust in this zone, do I apply the same kW/cfm to the exhaust fans as well as the return fans? It seems that the lower the fan volume the more inefficient the Appendix G values get from these tables.

Any guidance would be much appreciated.

Message-ID: <1D6BF369-8753-42A3-B222-309D6244FD78@tmecorp.com>

We got a review comment on a recent LEED project asking us to break down the baseline HVAC power into components even though there is no direction, or requirement, from 90.1-2004 to do so.

Can someone please help me understand why this would be necessary?

LEED guidelines say we have to model per Appendix G, but Appendix G doesn't say we have to do this.

I do not think it is necessary to do this as the baseline total fan energy consumption numbers would still be the same.

The equation in Appendix G is meant to give a total allowance (for each system) for supply, return, and exhaust fans. It doesn't matter if we break the allowance down into components or not as the total fan energy consumption remains the same. Therefore, there is no value in doing this.

If we did break the fan energy numbers into components, how would we do that given that there is no direction from ASHRAE or LEED on how to do this?

Thoughts?

Hi James,

As far as I?m concerned the main point of having project teams break the fan energy down into components is to ensure that the baseline fan power derived from the fan supply volume using Table G3.1.2.9 is not all attributed to supply fans if exhaust fans, return fans, etc. exist.

Regarding the breakdown, as far as I know you?re correct in that there is no guidance on that and what I do is take the percentages based on total fan power from the proposed case and apply it to the baseline case (e.g. 70% supply, 20% return, 10% exhaust).

I think a lot of us were making the mistake of applying the total calculated 
fan power/cfm to both the supply and return/exhaust fans (mostly due to 
ambiguous wording in 90.1). Forcing the modeler to explicitly divide up the 
calculated fan power allows the reviewer to more easily check that the 
energy was properly accounted for.



I played around on one project and found that unsurprisingly the fan energy 
didn?t change whether I put it all in supply air and none in exhaust, or 
divided it up based on the relative CFMs.

You have calculated the kW/cfm correctly according to the 2004 version of 
Appendix G. The allowance actually goes up a little in 2007, for your case. 
As for the second part of your question, no you do not apply the same kW/cfm

for all fans that are part of the system, including the exhaust fan. The cfm 
component is based on the supply fan cfm only. Unfortunately, Appendix G

Gregg,

I appreciate the response.

I see what they are trying to do; I just don?t think it needs to be done.  The total fan energy consumption (supply, return, exhaust) is the same for comparison purposes to the proposed design model.

On many projects, the baseline system is different than the proposed --> packaged single zone systems versus packaged VAV RTU, for example.  Therefore, there would not be any return fans on the packaged single zone systems to allocate fan energy to.  I don?t know if anyone is looking at this to that level of detail.  Another separate issue is that the Appendix G fan energy equation way over estimates the fan energy associated with real packaged single zone systems, but I?ve posted previously on that issue and won?t bore anyone with those details.

I guess the bottom line is that if GBCI absolutely insists that the baseline fan energy be broken into components, we?ll come up with some kind of percentage allocation, similar to what you have done, as applied to the total baseline fan energy consumption for the sole purpose of filling out the template.

Thanks! ?

As far as I?m concerned the main point of having project teams break the fan energy down into components is to ensure that the baseline fan power derived from the fan supply volume using Table G3.1.2.9 is not all attributed to supply fans if exhaust fans, return fans, etc. exist.

Regarding the breakdown, as far as I know you?re correct in that there is no guidance on that and what I do is take the percentages based on total fan power from the proposed case and apply it to the baseline case (e.g. 70% supply, 20% return, 10% exhaust).

You have calculated the kW/cfm correctly according to the 2004 version of Appendix G. The allowance actually goes up a little in 2007, for your case. As for the second part of your question, no you do not apply the same kW/cfm to the exhaust fan. The calculated allowed fan power the total allowed power for all fans that are part of the system, including the exhaust fan. The cfm component is based on the supply fan cfm only. Unfortunately, Appendix G gives no direction on how to divide the allowed fan power up among the various fans in the system.

G3.1.2.9 Gives you a formula for calculating system fan electrical power for supply, return, exhaust and relief. Lets sat I have a zone with a PSZ-HP that has a supply volume of 1500 cfm. Using this formula along with table G3.1.2.9 I get a fan horse power of 1.29 and kW of 1.17. This equates to 0.00078 kW/cfm ? which seems really high.

The second part to my question is assuming I have 500cfm of exhaust in this zone, do I apply the same kW/cfm to the exhaust fans as well as the return fans? It seems that the lower the fan volume the more inefficient the Appendix G values get from these tables.

Hi James,
I actually feel the baseline model fan energy is too small.  Baseline model fan usually gives 0.00078KW/cfm.  For proposed fans, typically it is 0.00016-0.00018 KW/cfm/in static.  With cooling coil at 1 inch, mid life filter at 1.5 (30% and 85%), energy wheel at 0.8, external static of 1.8 inch, you will get .00081 KW/CFM.  And the return fan and general exhaust fans haven?t been included yet.

Do you typically have less pressure drop than listed for the system?  Shall we use the clean filter or midlife filter for pressure calc?

Gregg,

I appreciate the response.

I see what they are trying to do; I just don?t think it needs to be done.  The total fan energy consumption (supply, return, exhaust) is the same for comparison purposes to the proposed design model.

On many projects, the baseline system is different than the proposed --> packaged single zone systems versus packaged VAV RTU, for example.  Therefore, there would not be any return fans on the packaged single zone systems to allocate fan energy to.  I don?t know if anyone is looking at this to that level of detail.  Another separate issue is that the Appendix G fan energy equation way over estimates the fan energy associated with real packaged single zone systems, but I?ve posted previously on that issue and won?t bore anyone with those details.

I guess the bottom line is that if GBCI absolutely insists that the baseline fan energy be broken into components, we?ll come up with some kind of percentage allocation, similar to what you have done, as applied to the total baseline fan energy consumption for the sole purpose of filling out the template.

Thanks! ?

Only you could say whether these factors were significant in your own project.

It could be possible that if you allocated all of the power to the supply fan, which might be variable flow with a VFD for example, and operate at part-load conditions much of the time, the energy consumption might be different than if an exhaust fan was included that runs continuously at fixed load with some allocation of the power usage.

Also the program may have some variances in heat gain to the airflows from the motor heat.

I?ll second Ellen Franconi?s suggestion of apportioning by design document sizing when there are equivalent pieces of equipment in both models.

I may be a bit late in responding and haven't gone through all the e-mails about it.  That being said,
I think it makes a difference as to how it's divided up.  The difference isn't in fan consumption, but where the fan heat is dumped.  That will effect the cooling and heating loads.  For example, if all the energy were in the supply fan, that would increase supply temperature of require the temperature off the coil to be lowered.  If it was all in the return fan, that fan energy would just end up increasing the return temperature.  I'm thinking more how that difference affects the economizer cycle and ventilation air. I'd proportion it out based on the relative HP's of your supply, return and exhaust fans.  Someone had a 70-20-10 split, which seems to be a good stab at it..

This issue will start to become a problem for anyone running energy models for LEED projects - reviewers on the new review teams are asking to see the total fan power for the baseline broken into individual components and reported as such in the template for Energy and Atmosphere Credit 1.  The 90.1-2004 User's Manual is also silent on the issue; however it raises another issue.  In the example (Example G-J on page G-28) the calculations use total building supply CFM for an 80,000SF medical office building.  Since the baseline is System 5 in that example and there would be multiple zones for the baseline, it appears that the equation should be used for the whole building only and not individual systems.  Is this how you are applying the formulas?  The user's manual notes that fan powered VAV boxes are NOT included in the total fan power number as calculated from G3.1.2.9.

At my firm, we proportion the baseline total fan power determined as an aggregated W/CFM based on  the hp assigned to the fan motors (supply, return, exhaust) in the design documents. Of course this assumes that your baseline and your proposed design have a one-to-one fan correspondence.

You have calculated the kW/cfm correctly according to the 2004 version of Appendix G. The allowance actually goes up a little in 2007, for your case. As for the second part of your question, no you do not apply the same kW/cfm to the exhaust fan. The calculated allowed fan power the total allowed power for all fans that are part of the system, including the exhaust fan. The cfm component is based on the supply fan cfm only. Unfortunately, Appendix G gives no direction on how to divide the allowed fan power up among the various fans in the system.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Appendix G Fan Power
G3.1.2.9 Gives you a formula for calculating system fan electrical power for supply, return, exhaust and relief. Lets sat I have a zone with a PSZ-HP that has a supply volume of 1500 cfm. Using this formula along with table G3.1.2.9 I get a fan horse power of 1.29 and kW of 1.17. This equates to 0.00078 kW/cfm - which seems really high.
The second part to my question is assuming I have 500cfm of exhaust in this zone, do I apply the same kW/cfm to the exhaust fans as well as the return fans? It seems that the lower the fan volume the more inefficient the Appendix G values get from these tables.
Any guidance would be much appreciated.

The Fan Power Allowance in ASHRAE 90.1 is based on "good" engineering
practice.  I have attached a .pdf showing the System Pressure Drops used in
determining the allowances for both the VAV fan system and the CV fan
system.  The fan efficiency assumed in both cases is 65% and air velocity is
assumed to be 400 fpm through the coils and filters.  Filter pressure drop
assumes dirty filters.  The standard allows additional credits for systems
with heat recovery, high performance filtration, lower design supply air
temperatures and the use of relief fans vs return fans.

Also, addendum ac of ASHRAE 90.1-2004 modified the fan power calculation
methodology allowing an expanded list of allowances that better suits a
wider range of building types including hospitals and lab buildings.  Those
changes are incorporated into Standard 90.1-2007.

I think that Michael Williamson gave the best reason yet why it is important
to split the baseline fan power among the supply, return and exhaust fan
components.  Like many others I distribute baseline fan hp using the same
ratios as the proposed design even though the baseline system configurations
may be slightly different.

Finally, three cheers to GBCI for putting review teams together that will
actually do a decent job of ensuring compliance with Standard 90.1 rather
than just taking the design teams word for it.  Maybe folks will begin to
realize that exceeding 90.1-2004 by 20-30% is actually a challenge and
building designs will begin to reflect the changes necessary to meet that
challenge.

This is good discussion on this topic.  I appreciate everyone's responses, and I'll a bit more to the fire :)

My overall thinking is that I don't think breaking up the fan power adds any "significant" value to the overall process.  Yes, it obviously does make a difference but with limited time, resources, and (more importantly) available fees (in my experience most clients want to pay very little for LEED energy modeling)  the question we should be asking --> is this of significant importance that justifies us spending time on it?   And the part about GBCI putting together review teams that enforce compliance with 90.1, that's great.  I am 100% for that.  But splitting up the baseline fan power isn't actually a requirement of 90.1 Appendix G so I do not know what they are enforcing here --> their own opinion of how we should be doing the modeling.  If they want to see the fan power split up, they need to lobby ASHRAE to get Appendix G changed so that we have more appropriate fan baseline numbers that are broken into components.  I think that would be the best approach.

I think we've agreed that splitting up the baseline fan energy into components does not make a difference with regards to overall fan energy consumption.  Now whether the fan energy is dumped in the supply or return, the fan energy still has to be removed by the cooling system or outside air via economizers?  I don't see how splitting up the fan energy makes a difference with regards to cooling energy consumption.  I would say that's true for most applications.  For lab applications, I can see how there may be a difference because the lab exhaust fans could be significant.  For the vast majority of applications, exhaust fans are fractional horsepower motors (i.e. << 1 HP), therefore very insignificant.

Regarding what I was saying earlier about Appendix G and overestimating fan power, this was for the small packaged single zone or split DX systems (i.e. system 3 & 4), which are probably the baseline systems on the majority of LEED projects in the US, hence the significance (may change somewhat now that the requirement for PVAV has shifted from 75000 SF to 25000 SF).  The fan power equations in Appendix G used to overshoot power for the smaller systems, but undershoot for the more intense systems like labs.  Now, the changes in 2007 version better account for labs, but the problem on the low end has not been fixed (could be in the works).  This is because the equations assume 3" to 5" pressure drop while small systems have pressure drops on the order of 1" to 1.25".  The example I use is my house --> a 3 ton/1200 CFM unit.  Per the equations in Appendix G, my system is estimated to use ~ 946 watts of fan power.  When I put my Fluke 39 meter on it and actually measure the power --> 550 watts, or 42% less.  I believe that ARI SEER calcs would assume ~ 365 watts/KCFM or 438 watts total  (I wonder if they are assuming the power based on the heating airflow because interestingly, my fan does use 440 watts in heating mode).  When we do a LEED project and assume PSZ systems for each zone (i.e. proposed design is VAV for example), we show ridiculous amounts of fan energy savings, which are really fake because the fan energy for real PSZ systems would be much less than the Appendix G equations show.

If we want a real challenge in exceeding 90.1 for energy savings --> let's get Appendix G changed to reflect more appropriate fan energy benchmarks for the smaller PSZ systems.  This could make a significant difference on LEED projects because meeting LEED requirements will be much tougher to meet.  I have personally seen projects that would not meet the LEED minimum 14% savings requirement were it not for the combination of artificially high baseline fan energy values along with a very generous allowance of exterior/site lighting power.  These changes could be of significant value to our profession and make our calculated savings numbers more legitimate.  That's the kind of stuff I think GBCI and our profession should focus on (versus worrying about breaking baseline fan energy numbers into components).

That's my two cents.

Have a great 4th weekend everyone.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Appendix G Fan Power


The Fan Power Allowance in ASHRAE 90.1 is based on "good" engineering practice.  I have attached a .pdf showing the System Pressure Drops used in determining the allowances for both the VAV fan system and the CV fan system.  The fan efficiency assumed in both cases is 65% and air velocity is assumed to be 400 fpm through the coils and filters.  Filter pressure drop assumes dirty filters.  The standard allows additional credits for systems with heat recovery, high performance filtration, lower design supply air temperatures and the use of relief fans vs return fans.

Also, addendum ac of ASHRAE 90.1-2004 modified the fan power calculation methodology allowing an expanded list of allowances that better suits a wider range of building types including hospitals and lab buildings.  Those changes are incorporated into Standard 90.1-2007.

I think that Michael Williamson gave the best reason yet why it is important to split the baseline fan power among the supply, return and exhaust fan components.  Like many others I distribute baseline fan hp using the same ratios as the proposed design even though the baseline system configurations may be slightly different.

Finally, three cheers to GBCI for putting review teams together that will actually do a decent job of ensuring compliance with Standard 90.1 rather than just taking the design teams word for it.  Maybe folks will begin to realize that exceeding 90.1-2004 by 20-30% is actually a challenge and building designs will begin to reflect the changes necessary to meet that challenge.

Hi James,

I actually feel the baseline model fan energy is too small.  Baseline model fan usually gives 0.00078KW/cfm.  For proposed fans, typically it is 0.00016-0.00018 KW/cfm/in static.  With cooling coil at 1 inch, mid life filter at 1.5 (30% and 85%), energy wheel at 0.8, external static of 1.8 inch, you will get .00081 KW/CFM.  And the return fan and general exhaust fans haven't been included yet.



Do you typically have less pressure drop than listed for the system?  Shall we use the clean filter or midlife filter for pressure calc?

Gregg,



I appreciate the response.



I see what they are trying to do; I just don't think it needs to be done.  The total fan energy consumption (supply, return, exhaust) is the same for comparison purposes to the proposed design model.



On many projects, the baseline system is different than the proposed --> packaged single zone systems versus packaged VAV RTU, for example.  Therefore, there would not be any return fans on the packaged single zone systems to allocate fan energy to.  I don't know if anyone is looking at this to that level of detail.  Another separate issue is that the Appendix G fan energy equation way over estimates the fan energy associated with real packaged single zone systems, but I've posted previously on that issue and won't bore anyone with those details.



I guess the bottom line is that if GBCI absolutely insists that the baseline fan energy be broken into components, we'll come up with some kind of percentage allocation, similar to what you have done, as applied to the total baseline fan energy consumption for the sole purpose of filling out the template.



Thanks! :)

Hi James,



As far as I'm concerned the main point of having project teams break the fan energy down into components is to ensure that the baseline fan power derived from the fan supply volume using Table G3.1.2.9 is not all attributed to supply fans if exhaust fans, return fans, etc. exist.



Regarding the breakdown, as far as I know you're correct in that there is no guidance on that and what I do is take the percentages based on total fan power from the proposed case and apply it to the baseline case (e.g. 70% supply, 20% return, 10% exhaust).

We got a review comment on a recent LEED project asking us to break down the baseline HVAC power into components even though there is no direction, or requirement, from 90.1-2004 to do so.



Can someone please help me understand why this would be necessary?



LEED guidelines say we have to model per Appendix G, but Appendix G doesn't say we have to do this.



I do not think it is necessary to do this as the baseline total fan energy consumption numbers would still be the same.



The equation in Appendix G is meant to give a total allowance (for each system) for supply, return, and exhaust fans. It doesn't matter if we break the allowance down into components or not as the total fan energy consumption remains the same. Therefore, there is no value in doing this.



If we did break the fan energy numbers into components, how would we do that given that there is no direction from ASHRAE or LEED on how to do this?



Thoughts?

This issue will start to become a problem for anyone running energy models for LEED projects - reviewers on the new review teams are asking to see the total fan power for the baseline broken into individual components and reported as such in the template for Energy and Atmosphere Credit 1.  The 90.1-2004 User's Manual is also silent on the issue; however it raises another issue.  In the example (Example G-J on page G-28) the calculations use total building supply CFM for an 80,000SF medical office building.  Since the baseline is System 5 in that example and there would be multiple zones for the baseline, it appears that the equation should be used for the whole building only and not individual systems.  Is this how you are applying the formulas?  The user's manual notes that fan powered VAV boxes are NOT included in the total fan power number as calculated from G3.1.2.9.

At my firm, we proportion the baseline total fan power determined as an aggregated W/CFM based on  the hp assigned to the fan motors (supply, return, exhaust) in the design documents. Of course this assumes that your baseline and your proposed design have a one-to-one fan correspondence.

You have calculated the kW/cfm correctly according to the 2004 version of Appendix G. The allowance actually goes up a little in 2007, for your case. As for the second part of your question, no you do not apply the same kW/cfm to the exhaust fan. The calculated allowed fan power the total allowed power for all fans that are part of the system, including the exhaust fan. The cfm component is based on the supply fan cfm only. Unfortunately, Appendix G gives no direction on how to divide the allowed fan power up among the various fans in the system.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Appendix G Fan Power



G3.1.2.9 Gives you a formula for calculating system fan electrical power for supply, return, exhaust and relief. Lets sat I have a zone with a PSZ-HP that has a supply volume of 1500 cfm. Using this formula along with table G3.1.2.9 I get a fan horse power of 1.29 and kW of 1.17. This equates to 0.00078 kW/cfm - which seems really high.



The second part to my question is assuming I have 500cfm of exhaust in this zone, do I apply the same kW/cfm to the exhaust fans as well as the return fans? It seems that the lower the fan volume the more inefficient the Appendix G values get from these tables.



Any guidance would be much appreciated.

Is that due to summer reheat? Healthcare facility requires somewhat high minimum air changes. So reheat may be needed in summer time.

Message-ID: <10ebea3b0907060813u4182737cvd1949eefe503a3d1@mail.gmail.com>

Dear colleagues:

I'm trying to guess how HVAC control works in energyplus. Currently I'm
trying to simulate a building with 8 zones with a low radiant heating &
cooling system. I have a doubt:

In Zone:HVAC:LowTemperatureRadiant:VariableFlow objects there are
Temperature Control Type (let's assume is operative temperature) ,
throttling ranges (which relates temperature around setpoint with water
flow) and control setpoint Schedules names. Are the three types of
temperatures the same? I mean, if control type is operative temperature,
does throttling range refer to operative temperature, and is the temperature
expressed in setpoint Schedules compared to current operative temperature in
the control device?

I ask this because in the example  "RadLoTempHydrCtrlOpt2.idf" , there is
THE SAME heating setpoint temperature schedule (12 C from 7h to 17h and 17C
the rest of the day) for the three existing zones ,but in one zone
temperature control type is mean air temperature, other is outdoor drybulb
temperature and the last one is outdoor wetbulb temperature.

Does this mean that, for example at 12h,  in the first zone the system
compares setpoint schedule (12C) with *mean air temperature* and throttles
water flow according to throttling range , in zone 2 the system compares
setpoint schedule (12C) with *outside drybulb temperature* and throttles
water flow according to throttling range and finally in zone 3 the system
compares setpoint schedule (12C) with *outdside wetbulb temperature* and
throttles water flow according to throttling range?

Thanks in advance.

Vikram,

I recently received USGBC feedback on this same issue.  For a single-building model, you take credit only for applications in Table 9.4.5 which apply to the design case.  For example, if there is no fa?ade lighting in the design case, the baseline case would not have fa?ade lighting.  If the design case had only one fa?ade illuminated, the 0.2 W/sf would be applied only to the area of that fa?ade.

I've attached the applicable pages from the 90.1 User's Manual.  There can be some confusion regarding the difference between "tradable" and "non-tradable" surfaces.  In essence, you should be safe if you only take baseline credit for applications which apply to the design case (tradable or not).

Thanks,

Dakota

Hello, all,

Does anyone know of a study that has compared the equivalency of the 2006 edition of the International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) compared to ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004? It seems to me that they are roughly equivalent...The State of Wisconsin allows either one to show compliance with its energy code. Is there something credible I can refer to that states that they are essentially equivalent? An admittedly quick search I did came up with only some lighting comparisons.

motivated engineers for our New York office.

Transsolar develops and validate concepts for high quality environments
that require minimal energy use. To achieve this we work collaboratively
within the design team from the start of the design process, considering
each step from the standpoint of fundamental thermodynamics. This
generates a climate concept in which form, material, and mechanical
systems are synergistic components of a well-orchestrated climate
control system; and conversely, an environmental control strategy that
is integral to the architectural concept.

We use a wide variety of computer simulation tools to evaluate our
concepts. We perform dynamic thermal simulation using TRNSYS to develop
and validate appropriate, reliable concepts in relationship to the
complex set of factors that is unique to each project. Similarly, we
perform daylight simulations using RADIANCE and computational fluid
dynamics (CFD) using FLUENT.

Transsolar engineers are often specialized in their work, but all carry
out a broad range of tasks. Responsibilities may include but are not
limited to:

*  Design and validation of ongoing projects via TRNSYS, RADIANCE, or
   FLUENT simulation 
*  Collaboration with German Transsolar offices
*  Project coordination
*  Participation in meetings and design charettes
*  Graphical representation of climate and energy concepts
*  Writing reports and correspondence
*  Domestic and international travel to project meetings and sites

Engineers with an emphasis on dynamic thermal simulation are our highest
priority, but experts in daylight or CFD are also of interest.  

Both entry-level positions and positions for 3-5 years experience are
available.  Our New York office is small but growing, providing ample
opportunity for advancement.

Preferred qualifications include:

*  Proven ability to creatively develop and apply non-traditional
   climate solutions to the indoor environment
*  Education related to building energy flows and building science: heat
   transfer, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, solar geometry and
   daylighting, etc. Ideal is a degree in mechanical engineering. An
   M.S. is preferred but not required.
*  Education/professional experience with architectural and mechanical
   systems for building climate control 
*  Experience with dynamic thermal simulation
*  Experience with daylight simulation
*  Experience with computational fluid dynamics in built environment
   applications
*  Excellent oral and written communication skills
*  Familiarity with basics of computational analysis (text-based input,
   computer programming, spreadsheet analysis)
*  Computer-based drawing skills (e.g. Corel Draw, Adobe Illustrator,
   etc)

Interested applicants may submit their resume and work samples via email
to nycjobs at transsolar.com

Hello Mohamad,

I'm assuming that item 1 in your inquiry refers to generation of files equal 
to the well-known typical meteorological years (TMYs.)  A TMY cannot be 
generated from a single year of hourly data -- TMYs are created by selecting 
"typical months" of weather data from recorded hourly data from anywhere 
from 15 to 30 years of records.  The methodology is described in references 
shown in the TMY users manual, NCDC (1981). Typical Meteorological Year 
User's Manual. Asheville, NC: National Climatic Data Center.  (See 
http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/pubs/tmy2/)

Some analyses that relate to the validity of the TMY data can be found in 
several reports dating from back in the late 1970's:
Hall, I.; Prairie, R.; Anderson, H.; Boes, E. (1978). Generation of Typical 
Meteorological Years for 26 SOLMET Stations. SAND78-1601. Albuquerque, NM: 
Sandia National Laboratories.
Menicucci, D.; Fernandez, J. (1988). A Comparison of Typical Year Solar 
Radiation Information with the SOLMET Data Base. SAND87-2379. Albuquerque, 
NM: Sandia National Laboratories.
Crawley, D.B. 1998. Which weather data should you use for energy simulations 
of commercial buildings? ASHRAE Transactions 104(2):498-515.
Huang, J. 1998. The impact of different weather data on simulated 
residential heating and cooling loads. ASHRAE Transactions 104(2):516-527.

More recently (2008-2009), ASHRAE has contracted for generation of 2500 to 
3000 additional cities (mostly in China) in a research project under the 
direction of TC-4.2 (Climatic Information).  Dr. Joe Huang (joe at drawbdl.com) 
is the prime contractor on that project.

In regard to item 2, there is some discussion related to climate change 
considerations on page 14.13 in the new Climatic Design Information Chapter 
(Chap 14) of the 2009 ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals.  The chapter 
addresses mostly design conditions and not generation of typical year 
weather data.

IECC 2006's Section 501.1Scope states 
"...commercial buildings shall meet either the requirements of
ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1, Energy Standard for Buildings Except for
Low-Rise Residential Buildings, or the requirements contained in this

Hello, all,

 

Does anyone know of a study that has compared the equivalency of the
2006 edition of the International Energy Conservation Code (IECC)
compared to ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004? It seems to me that they are
roughly equivalent...The State of Wisconsin allows either one to show
compliance with its energy code. Is there something credible I can refer
to that states that they are essentially equivalent? An admittedly quick
search I did came up with only some lighting comparisons.

I would add a nuance to your conclusion Chris:  ... "Therefore complying
with ASHRAE 90.1-2004 is one way of complying with IECC 2006."

 

The two publications do have their differences (notably with regard to
certain lighting controls and 90.1's space-by-space LPD table) that may
make one preferable over the other if and when you have the choice.  

 

Here are a few differences that are fresh in my mind:

-          A strict reading of IECC 2006 requires manual control in all
spaces, with exceptions to corridors and security concerns.  90.1-2004
however offers the flexibility to use just automatic controls (like a
ceiling occupancy sensor) in some spaces if manual control is not
desired.  

-          The two publications also diverge in regard to additional
controls required should you decide to have the interior lighting
automatically shut off via timeclock.

-          90.1-2004 has a lengthier list of situations where lighting
may be exempted when totaling the interior lighting power.  Some are
significant depending on your project (i.e. "Casino Gaming Areas")!

 

The two are "roughly equivalent" in the sense that they have roughly
equal degrees of stringency, but if the systems' designer is given the
choice the best answer would be to become familiar with both to ensure
you're using the most appropriate standard during design.  COMcheck may
be a useful tool mid-design to quickly generate two reports under the
two standards to identify some of the differences, though I would
caution that it may not pick up all the subtleties...

Message-ID: <C5E1527F129BF545A250B5AD0B0C26EF04467138@ENTWEXMB0000000.university.harvard.edu>

Dear colleagues,

 

You are invited to participate in an online survey on the use of
building energy simulation during design, construction and operation. A
special emphasis of the survey is to better understand who on the design
team owns and gets access to the energy model of a building, what role
the model currently plays during building design and construction, and
how the use of the model could be extended to the overall lifetime of a
building.

 

The survey is being carried out by the Graduate School of Design at
Harvard University in collaboration with the Office for Sustainability.
The survey is funded through the Harvard Real Estate Academic
Initiative. Our goal is to develop recommendations of how owners of
large real state should interact with their building design teams to get
maximum benefit from their building performance analysis contracts. We
hope that your input will help us to develop recommendations that are
acceptable, fair and profitable to all members of the design team.

To participate in the survey simply go to

There is a detailed explanation of how to create laminates in WINDOW and
Optics5 on the WINDOW Knowledge Base. Here is the direct URL

 

http://windows.lbl.gov/software/window/52/NFRCLaminates.html

 

The first link on that page, Laminate Procedures, points to a PDF file which
has step by step instructions about creating lamiantes.

WINDOW 5/WINDOW6 imports Optics database, user portion, not .usr files.  So
when you are done generating laminate, select User Database from the toolbar
(there is choice of Main db and User db). You should be able to see your
laminate that you generated (under Laminate category).  Then simply close
Optics, open W5 or W6 and in Preferences, under Optical Data tab, click on
radio button "Optics 5 User Database and make sure that it is
UserGlazing.mdb under LBNL Shared subdir (this is all deafult for OPTICS, so
if you did not change path in OPTICS this should work, otherwise you need to
navigate to correct mdb file).  Then close preferences, go to Glass library
and click on Import, select "IGDB or Optics User Database" from the drop
down menu under Format and click OK.  If everything is right, you will see
your laminate that you created in OPTICS and will be able to import it.

Has anyone successfully created an Optics5 file and imported into Windows5
or 6? I have a pretty complex glazing system that is composed of various
coated glazings, and plastic.  I think I've managed to create and save a
"Laminate" made of components and adhesive layers but I don't know where to
go from here.  It looks like the laminate is saved with a .usr extension.

 

When I click "Import" in Windows5, it opens up glazing.mdb but the laminate
i created in Optics5 doesn't show up...

 

Any help is greatly appreciated!

 

Thanks!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] EAC1 for Major Renovations
Message-ID: <4A571183.F0B8.00BB.0@ctagroup.com>

I am modeling a building that will be classified under major renovations for LEED v2.2.  I see that there is a different savings percentage required for this, but I am looking for some guidance on how to model this.  

The reference guide says that the baseline envelope parameters should be modeled as they exist rather than ASHRAE 90.1.  What does this include?  Should I still take out shading devices?  How are differences in scheduling and internal loads modeled?  Can I take advantage of a new water heater?  The majority of the shell is being redone, can I assume that the building will be tighter in terms of infiltration?  

The new building will be used a little differently and there is a small addition.  Also, this building will use the existing mechanical system that was installed about 8 years ago.  I have the specifications for the system, but it is probably not operating at the same efficiency that it was when it was installed.  Does anyone know of a good way to model an older system?  

If you could give me any advice or point me towards more information, I would really appreciate it.

Thanks,

I have a water to water heat pump loop challenge.

The project design the calls for the following 3 systems which are tied to a geothermal closed ground loop.


1)      Water to air heat pumps to serving all zones.

2)      A water to water heat pump serving the coil in an enthalpy energy recovery unit that provides 100% of the OA ventilation.  The ERU supplies tempered air into the return air plenums

3)      A water to water heat pump serving hydronic radiant floor zones in part of the project.

My first cut was to just model the project as water to water heat pumps with the energy recovery modeled as part of each water to air heat pump.  The ERU fan kW/cfm was distributed to each heat pump under Heat Recovery 2 tab.  I used a lake/well heat exchanger on the geothermal loop.

This disregards the efficiency differences for the design radiant floor hot water heating and the design pumping energy of the water to water heat pump loops.

Should I somehow use the  water to water heat pumps modeled with a loop-to-loop chiller?  Can anyone provide a better approach?

I'm using eQuest v3.63b.

Thanks in advance.

Dear colleagues,

 

My apologies for any cross-postings.

 

As previously announced we will be hosting this year's International
Radiance Workshop on October 22/23 at the Harvard Graduate School of
Design (GSD). Workshop details and a call for presentations can now be
found under http://projects.gsd.harvard.edu/radiance2009/. The
International Radiance Workshops are annual, two-day gatherings of
Radiance developers and users. The workshops consist of a series of
presentations that in the past included case studies on the use of
Radiance in lighting and/or daylighting projects, recent advances in
modeling glare and energy savings from lighting controls as well as the
use of Radiance in Art and Design. Presentations from previous workshops
can be downloaded from http://www.radiance-online.org/.  We are planning
to split the workshop into an 'application day' (Thursday) and a
'technical day' (Friday). There will also be a full day pre-workshop
course on 'HDR Photography and Glare Analysis' given by Professor
Mehlika Inanici (University of Washington) and Dr. Jan Wienold
(Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems) on Wednesday, October 21
, also at the GSD.

 

If you are interested in presenting at the workshop please send us a
working title and a brief abstract to reinhart at gsd.harvard.edu and
klagios at gsd.harvard.edu. Same as in the past we will be making all
presentations freely available after the workshop. 

 

We are looking forward to receiving your abstracts and welcoming you to
Cambridge.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Condensing Boilers for DHW
Message-ID: <00b001ca04c2$d0a8a440$71f9ecc0$@com>

With the release of eQUEST 3.63b we are given the option to model
Condensing Gas-Fired Boilers for hot water heating.  However, domestic hot
water can still only be modeled by simplistic DW Heaters which have
options only for Electric, Gas, & Steam.

 

Would it make sense to just model the DHW loop as a HW loop with a process
load equal to the service hot water demand or is there some fundamental
reason why a hot water loop shouldn't be used as a domestic loop in
eQUEST?

 

Any input is appreciated.  Thanks.

Message-ID: <00e301ca04cc$dfeb9c00$9fc2d400$@com>

The only challenge I found in modeling DHW with a hot water loop was the
incoming water temperature being based on return water temperature,
however by adjusting the DT and supply temperature on the process load I
think I've approximated it properly.  

 

I ran two loops, one a DHW loop and one a HW loop and found them to be
within 1% of each other.  Then when I switched the HW boiler over to a
condensing boiler I found a 14% savings.  Finally, to verify that the
condensing boiler was operating correctly, I increased the supply T so
that the return water temp would be around 110.  After doing this the
results came within 1% of each other again. 

 

Sounds like this is the way to go for modeling a condensing boiler for
DHW.

My question is can the modeling software and community actually account for two stage ECM fan motor WSHP equipment systems (with separate DOAS) operating most of the time in the single zone at part load conditions, either off or operating on first stage with 75% design cfm and 50% design water flow?

G3.1.2.9 Gives you a formula for calculating system fan electrical power
for supply, return, exhaust and relief. Lets sat I have a zone with a
PSZ-HP that has a supply volume of 1500 cfm. Using this formula along
with table G3.1.2.9 I get a fan horse power of 1.29 and kW of 1.17. This
equates to 0.00078 kW/cfm - which seems really high. 

 

The second part to my question is assuming I have 500cfm of exhaust in
this zone, do I apply the same kW/cfm to the exhaust fans as well as the
return fans? It seems that the lower the fan volume the more inefficient
the Appendix G values get from these tables. 

 

Any guidance would be much appreciated.

You have calculated the kW/cfm correctly according to the 2004 version
of Appendix G. The allowance actually goes up a little in 2007, for your
case. As for the second part of your question, no you do not apply the
same kW/cfm to the exhaust fan. The calculated allowed fan power the
total allowed power for all fans that are part of the system, including
the exhaust fan. The cfm component is based on the supply fan cfm only.
Unfortunately, Appendix G gives no direction on how to divide the
allowed fan power up among the various fans in the system.

At my firm, we proportion the baseline total fan power determined as an
aggregated W/CFM based on  the hp assigned to the fan motors (supply,
return, exhaust) in the design documents. Of course this assumes that
your baseline and your proposed design have a one-to-one fan
correspondence.

You have calculated the kW/cfm correctly according to the 2004 version
of Appendix G. The allowance actually goes up a little in 2007, for your
case. As for the second part of your question, no you do not apply the
same kW/cfm to the exhaust fan. The calculated allowed fan power the
total allowed power for all fans that are part of the system, including
the exhaust fan. The cfm component is based on the supply fan cfm only.
Unfortunately, Appendix G gives no direction on how to divide the
allowed fan power up among the various fans in the system.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Appendix G Fan Power

 
G3.1.2.9 Gives you a formula for calculating system fan electrical
power for supply, return, exhaust and relief. Lets sat I have a zone
with a PSZ-HP that has a supply volume of 1500 cfm. Using this formula
along with table G3.1.2.9 I get a fan horse power of 1.29 and kW of
1.17. This equates to 0.00078 kW/cfm ? which seems really high. 
 
The second part to my question is assuming I have 500cfm of exhaust in

This issue will start to become a problem for anyone running energy
models for LEED projects - reviewers on the new review teams are asking
to see the total fan power for the baseline broken into individual
components and reported as such in the template for Energy and
Atmosphere Credit 1.  The 90.1-2004 User's Manual is also silent on the
issue; however it raises another issue.  In the example (Example G-J on
page G-28) the calculations use total building supply CFM for an
80,000SF medical office building.  Since the baseline is System 5 in
that example and there would be multiple zones for the baseline, it
appears that the equation should be used for the whole building only and
not individual systems.  Is this how you are applying the formulas?  The
user's manual notes that fan powered VAV boxes are NOT included in the
total fan power number as calculated from G3.1.2.9.

The equation is meant for each HVAC system. The example in the User's
manual is probably not a very good one. If it was an 80,000 sf single
story building it would only have one baseline Packaged VAV  system and
the example would be correct. If it were a multi-story building, there
would be one baseline Packaged VAV system for each floor and the example
would be incorrect. 

 

The User's manual is correct that the power of the parallel fan-powered
terminal units in systems 6 and 8 is not included in the calculation.
The power of those fans is specifically called out in G3.1.3.14 at 0.35
W/cfm.

Interesting to hear the request for fan energy delineation in the template.

The old ECB had a largely one to one relationship and Ellen's approach worked.

Appendix G is no longer one to one and that is key to understand.
Section G3.1.1 in its varied & modified versions prescribes single zone or multi-zone  system types and provides constraints on system delineation.

So determine the number, types, sizes of the systems in the baseline model then go back and solve the fan power for each.

We got a review comment on a recent LEED project asking us to break down the baseline HVAC power into components even though there is no direction, or requirement, from 90.1-2004 to do so.

Can someone please help me understand why this would be necessary?

LEED guidelines say we have to model per Appendix G, but Appendix G doesn't say we have to do this.

I do not think it is necessary to do this as the baseline total fan energy consumption numbers would still be the same.

The equation in Appendix G is meant to give a total allowance (for each system) for supply, return, and exhaust fans. It doesn't matter if we break the allowance down into components or not as the total fan energy consumption remains the same. Therefore, there is no value in doing this.

If we did break the fan energy numbers into components, how would we do that given that there is no direction from ASHRAE or LEED on how to do this?

Thoughts?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Appendix G Fan Power

G3.1.2.9 Gives you a formula for calculating system fan electrical power for supply, return, exhaust and relief. Lets sat I have a zone with a PSZ-HP that has a supply volume of 1500 cfm. Using this formula along with table G3.1.2.9 I get a fan horse power of 1.29 and kW of 1.17. This equates to 0.00078 kW/cfm ? which seems really high.

The second part to my question is assuming I have 500cfm of exhaust in this zone, do I apply the same kW/cfm to the exhaust fans as well as the return fans? It seems that the lower the fan volume the more inefficient the Appendix G values get from these tables.

Any guidance would be much appreciated.

Hi James,

As far as I?m concerned the main point of having project teams break the fan energy down into components is to ensure that the baseline fan power derived from the fan supply volume using Table G3.1.2.9 is not all attributed to supply fans if exhaust fans, return fans, etc. exist.

Regarding the breakdown, as far as I know you?re correct in that there is no guidance on that and what I do is take the percentages based on total fan power from the proposed case and apply it to the baseline case (e.g. 70% supply, 20% return, 10% exhaust).

We got a review comment on a recent LEED project asking us to break down the baseline HVAC power into components even though there is no direction, or requirement, from 90.1-2004 to do so.

Can someone please help me understand why this would be necessary?

LEED guidelines say we have to model per Appendix G, but Appendix G doesn't say we have to do this.

I do not think it is necessary to do this as the baseline total fan energy consumption numbers would still be the same.

The equation in Appendix G is meant to give a total allowance (for each system) for supply, return, and exhaust fans. It doesn't matter if we break the allowance down into components or not as the total fan energy consumption remains the same. Therefore, there is no value in doing this.

If we did break the fan energy numbers into components, how would we do that given that there is no direction from ASHRAE or LEED on how to do this?

Thoughts?

You have calculated the kW/cfm correctly according to the 2004 version of Appendix G. The allowance actually goes up a little in 2007, for your case. As for the second part of your question, no you do not apply the same kW/cfm to the exhaust fan. The calculated allowed fan power the total allowed power for all fans that are part of the system, including the exhaust fan. The cfm component is based on the supply fan cfm only. Unfortunately, Appendix G gives no direction on how to divide the allowed fan power up among the various fans in the system.

I think a lot of us were making the mistake of applying the total calculated 
fan power/cfm to both the supply and return/exhaust fans (mostly due to 
ambiguous wording in 90.1). Forcing the modeler to explicitly divide up the 
calculated fan power allows the reviewer to more easily check that the 
energy was properly accounted for.



I played around on one project and found that unsurprisingly the fan energy 
didn?t change whether I put it all in supply air and none in exhaust, or 
divided it up based on the relative CFMs.

Gregg,

I appreciate the response.

I see what they are trying to do; I just don?t think it needs to be done.  The total fan energy consumption (supply, return, exhaust) is the same for comparison purposes to the proposed design model.

On many projects, the baseline system is different than the proposed --> packaged single zone systems versus packaged VAV RTU, for example.  Therefore, there would not be any return fans on the packaged single zone systems to allocate fan energy to.  I don?t know if anyone is looking at this to that level of detail.  Another separate issue is that the Appendix G fan energy equation way over estimates the fan energy associated with real packaged single zone systems, but I?ve posted previously on that issue and won?t bore anyone with those details.

I guess the bottom line is that if GBCI absolutely insists that the baseline fan energy be broken into components, we?ll come up with some kind of percentage allocation, similar to what you have done, as applied to the total baseline fan energy consumption for the sole purpose of filling out the template.

Thanks! ?

Hi James,
I actually feel the baseline model fan energy is too small.  Baseline model fan usually gives 0.00078KW/cfm.  For proposed fans, typically it is 0.00016-0.00018 KW/cfm/in static.  With cooling coil at 1 inch, mid life filter at 1.5 (30% and 85%), energy wheel at 0.8, external static of 1.8 inch, you will get .00081 KW/CFM.  And the return fan and general exhaust fans haven?t been included yet.

Do you typically have less pressure drop than listed for the system?  Shall we use the clean filter or midlife filter for pressure calc?

Gregg,

I appreciate the response.

I see what they are trying to do; I just don?t think it needs to be done.  The total fan energy consumption (supply, return, exhaust) is the same for comparison purposes to the proposed design model.

On many projects, the baseline system is different than the proposed --> packaged single zone systems versus packaged VAV RTU, for example.  Therefore, there would not be any return fans on the packaged single zone systems to allocate fan energy to.  I don?t know if anyone is looking at this to that level of detail.  Another separate issue is that the Appendix G fan energy equation way over estimates the fan energy associated with real packaged single zone systems, but I?ve posted previously on that issue and won?t bore anyone with those details.

I guess the bottom line is that if GBCI absolutely insists that the baseline fan energy be broken into components, we?ll come up with some kind of percentage allocation, similar to what you have done, as applied to the total baseline fan energy consumption for the sole purpose of filling out the template.

Thanks! ?

Hi James,

As far as I?m concerned the main point of having project teams break the fan energy down into components is to ensure that the baseline fan power derived from the fan supply volume using Table G3.1.2.9 is not all attributed to supply fans if exhaust fans, return fans, etc. exist.

Regarding the breakdown, as far as I know you?re correct in that there is no guidance on that and what I do is take the percentages based on total fan power from the proposed case and apply it to the baseline case (e.g. 70% supply, 20% return, 10% exhaust).

We got a review comment on a recent LEED project asking us to break down the baseline HVAC power into components even though there is no direction, or requirement, from 90.1-2004 to do so.

Can someone please help me understand why this would be necessary?

LEED guidelines say we have to model per Appendix G, but Appendix G doesn't say we have to do this.

I do not think it is necessary to do this as the baseline total fan energy consumption numbers would still be the same.

The equation in Appendix G is meant to give a total allowance (for each system) for supply, return, and exhaust fans. It doesn't matter if we break the allowance down into components or not as the total fan energy consumption remains the same. Therefore, there is no value in doing this.

If we did break the fan energy numbers into components, how would we do that given that there is no direction from ASHRAE or LEED on how to do this?

Thoughts?

This issue will start to become a problem for anyone running energy models for LEED projects ? reviewers on the new review teams are asking to see the total fan power for the baseline broken into individual components and reported as such in the template for Energy and Atmosphere Credit 1.  The 90.1-2004 User?s Manual is also silent on the issue; however it raises another issue.  In the example (Example G-J on page G-28) the calculations use total building supply CFM for an 80,000SF medical office building.  Since the baseline is System 5 in that example and there would be multiple zones for the baseline, it appears that the equation should be used for the whole building only and not individual systems.  Is this how you are applying the formulas?  The user?s manual notes that fan powered VAV boxes are NOT included in the total fan power number as calculated from G3.1.2.9.

At my firm, we proportion the baseline total fan power determined as an aggregated W/CFM based on  the hp assigned to the fan motors (supply, return, exhaust) in the design documents. Of course this assumes that your baseline and your proposed design have a one-to-one fan correspondence.

You have calculated the kW/cfm correctly according to the 2004 version of Appendix G. The allowance actually goes up a little in 2007, for your case. As for the second part of your question, no you do not apply the same kW/cfm to the exhaust fan. The calculated allowed fan power the total allowed power for all fans that are part of the system, including the exhaust fan. The cfm component is based on the supply fan cfm only. Unfortunately, Appendix G gives no direction on how to divide the allowed fan power up among the various fans in the system.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Appendix G Fan Power

G3.1.2.9 Gives you a formula for calculating system fan electrical power for supply, return, exhaust and relief. Lets sat I have a zone with a PSZ-HP that has a supply volume of 1500 cfm. Using this formula along with table G3.1.2.9 I get a fan horse power of 1.29 and kW of 1.17. This equates to 0.00078 kW/cfm ? which seems really high.

The second part to my question is assuming I have 500cfm of exhaust in this zone, do I apply the same kW/cfm to the exhaust fans as well as the return fans? It seems that the lower the fan volume the more inefficient the Appendix G values get from these tables.

Any guidance would be much appreciated.

Only you could say whether these factors were significant in your own project.

It could be possible that if you allocated all of the power to the supply fan, which might be variable flow with a VFD for example, and operate at part-load conditions much of the time, the energy consumption might be different than if an exhaust fan was included that runs continuously at fixed load with some allocation of the power usage.

Also the program may have some variances in heat gain to the airflows from the motor heat.

I?ll second Ellen Franconi?s suggestion of apportioning by design document sizing when there are equivalent pieces of equipment in both models.

Colleagues,

I am working on a study of the automated shading devices (external
louvers and blinds). What I am trying to do is to study the impact of
tilt angle of the louvers on the energy consumption of an office space,
which has dimming lights. 

If I would like to link the louvers to the lighting and HVAC to get the

how can this be done? In addition, which program can be used? 

Your response is appreciated.

Thanks Jerry and Bill:

I think you might be right but still the outputs are very huge to understand for
a short time interval unless it is for a year as Bill said.  CO2 production
calculated ranged from 20-30 Kg for some scenarios at peak time on a typical
summer day.  

Does it mean for example that the building produces 25 Kg/Megajoules/year at
13.00 of local time? 
And if the simulations held for only one summer typical day, what does this
mean?  

Is  it better to be addressed in terms of the variation of CO2 production; i.e.
CO2 production has varied from 12.00-13.00 LST by 
5 Kg/megajoules/year ?

Any thoughts !!!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] U-values and Energy Modeling
Message-ID: <e01200270907171332r36f95250j915fb38d814a153@mail.gmail.com>

All,

There is a difference between summer U-value and overall U-value on a
glazing assembly I'm investigating. I'm curious how equest takes this into
account, would the U-value be dynamically modified given the environmental
conditions or does it always assume the worst case? If so, could you use the
summer U-value in your energy model and take that benefit?

Please provide a fact answer, not what you think.

Thanks,
Mohamad

Dear All,

jEPlus is a EnergyPlus shell for parametric runs. It is written in Java therefore supports multiple platforms. The first release of the program is available for download from this page: http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~yzhang/wiki/doku.php?id=software:java:jeplus

Some novelties of the program include: a simple syntax to specify alternative values; a parameter tree; multi-threading; as well as properly labelled result tables ready for importing into databases using SQL. More details can be found on the web site as well as in the paper to be presented at BS09.

Please feel free to try the program and leave me some feedback. I cannot think of any reason that jEPlus may harm your computer. However, please still read the disclaimer carefully and use the program at your own risk :-P 

Best regards,

Yi

Hi Harry,

Have you had a look at Open Studio? http://openstudio.sourceforge.net/
This is an open source plugin that turns Google Sketchup into a 3D interface
for EnergyPlus. So you can of course read IDF files from within Sketchup ,
but also call E+ directly to simulate basic building descriptions. This is
open source so there should not be any problem to re-use the code for your
own prupose I guess.

Regards,

Damien

Message-ID: <82422C2EAD692049B1510B658F5C9E050D8D75E705@SEGSERVER.seg.lan>

Bldg-Sim Group,

Does anyone have energy performance data on Insulated Concrete Forms (ICF), not SIPS, related to commercial buildings, especially in Northern US climates?

Including the effect of reduced infiltration for ICF over standard construction (0.5 ACH vs. 0.25 ACH), I am seeing ~$1,000/yr savings for going to an ~R-27 ICF from an ~R-20 2x6 cavity wall with 1" of rigid.  The building is an ~35,000 SF assisted living facility with a geothermal HVAC system.

Modeling in EQUEST shows minimal annual energy savings and peak load reduction; it seems mainly related to increase R-value and not increased thermal mass.  Off hand, I was under the impression that EQUEST uses ASHRAE transfer functions that account for the thermal mass of the wall if you select "layers input". Could someone confirm/deny this?

Some of my thoughts:
-          I think the daily temperature swings are generally less in a northern climate many days out of the year and the building operates 24/7, therefore the deltaT from inside to outside is low.
-          Likewise, putting insulation between the space and the mass in the wall will slow heat transfer and lower the deltaT as opposed to using passive solar mass/Thomb Walls which the mass is in the space.

Thanks in advance for any comments,

Hi All, 

 

I am trying to model a building with water-to-water heat pump connected
to ground HX and 4-pipe AHUs with induction unit at the terminal. 

I have specified induction unit at the terminal, to model active chilled
beams, with a dedicated outdoor air unit. But with this configuration on
airside I am not able to attach the water to water heat pump to any
condenser water loop on the water side. Is there a way I can model GSHP
serving active chilled beams in equest?

 

Thanks in advance.

Would the following get you close enough (ignoring the DOAS side)?

 

1)      Specify a water-air HP system

2)      Zero out the fan energy

3)      Factor the load side pumping energy into the EIR of the HP

a.       Alternatively, you could add your load side pump energy to the
source side pump

 

Obviously there's limitations either way and I've never tried this, just

I've chatted with Rashmi and feel like others may want to know how this
can be done in the future...  Also copying [Equest-users] on this
discussion as advised by a list administrator.  

 

 

See attached screengrab for a simple visual of how I accomplished
this...

 

Setting up the 4-pipe system sourced from a closed ground loop:

1.	Create a 'chiller' of the type 'water-to-water heat pump'
2.	Create an independent circulation loop of the type 'lake/well'
3.	Create a ground loop heat exchanger of the type 'lake/well'
4.	Select as the chiller CW loop and GLHX circulation loop the
independent loop you created - they should connect without errors
5.	Assign a custom temperature schedule for the lake/well ground
loop in the screen that pops up when you double click the GLHX (read on)
6.	Make sure the default head/pump properties for the circulation
loop and GLHX make sense for your system - adjust as necessary.  (i.e.
if it's a closed ground loop, there shouldn't be static head)

 

The tricky thing is that both Rashmi and I were dealing with closed-loop
ground heat exchanger (not lake/well).  The solution I came to model
this was to temporarily save the project in a separate directory to keep
my work, then go back to the wizards and heat/cool the same building
reasonably using the DX/DX heating/cooling ground source heatpump
option, with all appropriate ground and field properties well defined.  

 

Once this is done, you can have eQuest additionally generate an hourly
report over of the resulting ground loop temperatures throughout the
year (actual procedure eludes my memory, but it's in the archives).
Once this is done, I used that raw data to come up with the resulting
weekly average temperatures in the ground loop using excel.  I then used
these figures to create a custom temperature schedule for the actual
project, which was assigned to the GLHX as mentioned above.  This way
you're reasonably accurately representing what temperatures the
water-to-water equipment is seeing coming out of the ground throughout
the year based on your actual geographic, ground loop, and soil
condition variables as defined.

 

The final logical step, and one I'm currently working on learning for
myself, is defining a custom performance curve for the water-to-water
equipment that's representative of the real thing.  I have been advised
the default chiller curves as well as the water-to-air heatpump curves
from the Climatemaster eQuest add-on are not appropriate for modeling
water-to-water heatpumps. 

 

Best of luck!

 

PS: Apologies for the screenshot's quality - I had issues making it
small enough for the mailing list to accept.

Dear Colleagues,

Is anyone here familiar with the Institute of Energy and Sustainable
Development at De Montfort University? They have a Masters program in Energy
and Sustainable Building Design that looks very interesting. Any feedback on
this program or recommendations on similar Masters Programs is greatly
appreciated. 

Thank you,

Nick/Rashmi-

 

One limitation of the Well-Water-to-Water Heat-Pump (or W2WHP, TYPE =
HEAT-PUMP) is that only a chilled water or 2-pipe circulation loop can be
attached to it.  This can be an issue if the central heat pump is designed
to supply both hot and chilled water.  

 

>From other BLDG-SIM and EQUEST-USER posts, for simulating WSWHPs that can
produce both hot and cold water simultaneously, I gather that analysts often
opt to use loop-to-loop heat pump (or L2LHP, TYPE = LOOP-TO-LOOP-HP)
instead, since you can connect both a chilled water and hot water loop to
the chiller.  However, from experience, I know that many of the
water-to-water heat pumps available are NOT loop-to-loop heat pumps, but
rather a series of water-to-water heat pumps that are manifolded to allow
some circuits to operate in heating while others are operating in cooling,
with all circuits  sharing a common condenser water loop.  If you read the
description of the L2LHP chiller closely, the L2LHP operates much
differently than the W2WHP machine.  Also, I would be wary of using the
default DOE-2 performance curves for loop-to-loop and well-water-to-water
chillers, as I found that the default performance curves were quite
different from what is currently available in the US market.

 

The approach you have outlined, I believe, is on the right track, if the
correct chiller type is being simulated. However, it seems unlikely that
estimating the ground loop loads/temperatures using a building model with
single-zone WSHPs will produce the same results as the W2WHP/chilled beam
system you described.  

 

Here are some reasons:

1)      Does not account for pump heat (both positive and negative impact
depending on it the system is in heating or cooling) on the building
circulation (chilled beam) loops.

2)      Using the "DX/DX heating/cooling ground source heat pump" option you
mentioned, you will basically get single-zone WSHP systems, where the WLHP
loop is connected to the eQUEST GSHX (well-field) model.  This method may be
taking too much credit for periods when there is high diversity in the
building.  If a small fraction of the building requires cooling, the chilled
water system would have to run and the W2WHP would impart a load on the
ground loop and GSHX.  However, in a building model with single zone
water-to-air heat pumps, I believe the load on the loop could, in theory, be
balanced by a fraction of units in heating and cooling, so that the ground
temperature leaving the building is the same as it was coming in.  

3)      Finally, part-load performance curves for water-to-air heat pumps
are likely not appropriate for a water-to-water heat pump system.

 

Here is a suggested alternative (that I have fully implemented in eQUEST):

 

1)      Take the hourly LOADS on the lake/well loop model you have created.

2)      Apply them, with the appropriate schedules, as a internal energy
source in a single space building.

3)      This space is served by a single zone, water-to-air heat pump, which
has a WLHP condenser loop and a GSHX, as would be typically be created by a
the wizard.

4)      Make all the surfaces of the space adiabatic, zero out all other
loads and the system fan energy, and set you cooling/heating EIRs to 1.0.
With a few other adjustments (not enough time to list them all), you can
more or less get the load on the WSHP loop to be the same as internal energy
source load applied to the space.  

 

In essence, you are taking the loads directly from the lake-well loop and
transferring them to the other model what includes the GSHX model of the
well-field.  From this secondary model, you can then extract the
temperatures returning from the well-field.  The rest is similar to you
described, except you could even get as detailed as 8760 hourly load and
temperature schedules in each model.

 

Any thoughts from others who have simulated/studied these systems before?

I've chatted with Rashmi and feel like others may want to know how this can
be done in the future...  Also copying [Equest-users] on this discussion as
advised by a list administrator.  

 

 

See attached screengrab for a simple visual of how I accomplished this...

 

Setting up the 4-pipe system sourced from a closed ground loop:

1.	Create a 'chiller' of the type 'water-to-water heat pump'
2.	Create an independent circulation loop of the type 'lake/well'
3.	Create a ground loop heat exchanger of the type 'lake/well'
4.	Select as the chiller CW loop and GLHX circulation loop the
independent loop you created - they should connect without errors
5.	Assign a custom temperature schedule for the lake/well ground loop
in the screen that pops up when you double click the GLHX (read on)
6.	Make sure the default head/pump properties for the circulation loop
and GLHX make sense for your system - adjust as necessary.  (i.e. if it's a
closed ground loop, there shouldn't be static head)

 

The tricky thing is that both Rashmi and I were dealing with closed-loop
ground heat exchanger (not lake/well).  The solution I came to model this
was to temporarily save the project in a separate directory to keep my work,
then go back to the wizards and heat/cool the same building reasonably using
the DX/DX heating/cooling ground source heatpump option, with all
appropriate ground and field properties well defined.  

 

Once this is done, you can have eQuest additionally generate an hourly
report over of the resulting ground loop temperatures throughout the year
(actual procedure eludes my memory, but it's in the archives).  Once this is
done, I used that raw data to come up with the resulting weekly average
temperatures in the ground loop using excel.  I then used these figures to
create a custom temperature schedule for the actual project, which was
assigned to the GLHX as mentioned above.  This way you're reasonably
accurately representing what temperatures the water-to-water equipment is
seeing coming out of the ground throughout the year based on your actual
geographic, ground loop, and soil condition variables as defined.

 

The final logical step, and one I'm currently working on learning for
myself, is defining a custom performance curve for the water-to-water
equipment that's representative of the real thing.  I have been advised the
default chiller curves as well as the water-to-air heatpump curves from the
Climatemaster eQuest add-on are not appropriate for modeling water-to-water
heatpumps. 

 

Best of luck!

Would the following get you close enough (ignoring the DOAS side)?

 

1)      Specify a water-air HP system

2)      Zero out the fan energy

3)      Factor the load side pumping energy into the EIR of the HP

a.       Alternatively, you could add your load side pump energy to the
source side pump

 

Obviously there's limitations either way and I've never tried this, just
thinking out loud.  Certainly someone else out there can comment who has
attempted this?

Hi All, 

 

I am trying to model a building with water-to-water heat pump connected to
ground HX and 4-pipe AHUs with induction unit at the terminal. 

I have specified induction unit at the terminal, to model active chilled
beams, with a dedicated outdoor air unit. But with this configuration on
airside I am not able to attach the water to water heat pump to any
condenser water loop on the water side. Is there a way I can model GSHP
serving active chilled beams in equest?

 

Thanks in advance.

It is my understanding that exterior fa?ade lighting needs to be modeled
identically in both baseline and design case models, and that the design
case fa?ade lighting needs to meet the requirements of Table 9.4.5.  Credit
can be taken for the tradeable surfaces.

Hi Vikram,
Don't know if you already have an answer to this.

Anyways, this is what my understanding is -- The lighting power for tradable
surfaces / tradable linear feet would need to be calculated for all such
surfaces / linear feet. Since facades fall in the non-tradable surfaces
category, one would need to consider only the facade that you are planning
to light-up in the Designed case. This is confirmed by the fact how the text
in the Table is read as:

". . . for each illuminated wall or surface . . ."

Besides that, to comply with the light pollution reduction credit point
(SSc8), the lighting power needs to be half of what the Table you referenced
is, i.e. 0.1W/sf for each illuminated wall or surface or 2.5W/ft for each
illuminated wall or surface length. Finally, to further comply with SSc8,
all other surfaces / linear feet need to be 80% of what is referenced in the
Table 9.4.5. There are other SSc8 credit requirements that I won't go into
right now, considering you are perhaps looking at this from the perspective
of energy modeling.

Hope rest is all well with you.

cheers,
Neeraj

Abaza,

Since Georgia is predominantly a cooling climate, one approach you could take is to size the geothermal loop for the heating demand and provide a cooling tower to provide cooling beyond what the geothermal loop can do. This will keep the loop installation costs down.

Geothermal systems work best for buildings that have similar amount of cooling and heating each year. If there is more of one than the other, the ground temperature may gradually warm up or cool off over time. The hybrid approach avoids this by sizing the loop for the smaller load (heating or cooling), then if more cooling is needed install a cooling tower and if more heating is needed install a boiler. The controls need to be designed carefully so that the boiler does not heat the ground instead of the building.

Hope this helps.

See www.rehau.com and/or www.hardingeotech.com 	

Both of these companies offer an enhancement to the traditional single, HDPE, U-bend / grout design for vertical geothermal bores that claim to reduce the number of bores required.

We haven't designed using these products yet, but are waiting for the right project to apply it to. I'm sure there are other products out there as well...

I vote:  Assume all spaces are the same setpoint and temp for a LEED
analysis unless there will be actual, significant differences in the real
building
 
a) The simulation tool is assuming that the HVAC is trying to do exactly
that
b) Your weather file is an approximation (TMY)
c) You have no idea what the actual thermostats will be set for
d) the simulation will not model the actual control system response
e) LEED has accepted our models with that assumption, which I think is
appropriate based on the above reasons and a variety of others.  There's
only so much you can expect from a model of a yet-to-be-constructed
facility!

Hi all,

I'm building a model (in TRNSYS) for LEED, and I'm trying to figure out how
detailed I need to be with my zone adjacencies. TRNSYS can do very detailed
accounting for how a zone's walls (+floors, ceilings) interact with other
zones. However, for conditioned spaces, the heat transfer is zero when the
spaces are the maintained at same temperature. My life would be a lot easier
if I could just say that the temperature on the outside of each wall was
equal to the temp setpoint, or perhaps the temp of the largest neighboring
zone, rather than do a detailed description of all interzonal adjacencies.
90.1 and The LEED Ref Guide don't seem to say anything about this. So, I'm
wondering, based on your knowledge of whatever program you use, how detailed
to I need to be? Do eQuest, Trace, energy Plus, etc, do detailed adjacency
calcs or just assume a boundary temperature?

Thanks,
Cramer

Linda,

I don't have any weather files for Iraq, but I did create two TMY 
weather files for Tehran back in 2006. The following note explains their 
derivation. Since Bldg-sim does not accept attachments, I will send the 
  *.bin files to you in a separate e-mail.

I also wish to inform all those interested in international weather data 
that I'm a month or two away from completing ASHRAE RP-1477, 
"Development of 2,500 weather files for international locations".
When that product has been accepted and released by ASHRAE, probably by 
the end of 2009, this will make available "typical year" weather files 
for over 3,000  international, i.e., non-US/Canada, locations.

That IWEC2 weather data set will include at least 22 locations in Iran, 
but alas, still none in Iraq.

May I ask more specifics on your need for weather data in Iran and Iraq?
Despite their proximity to each other, the weather in the two countries
is very distinct.

MEMORANDUM

Re: Two Typical Year Weather Files for Tehran
From: Joe Huang, White Box Technologies
Date: March 5, 2007

Two Typical Year Weather Files have been created for Tehran from weather 
data for 1961 through 2003 published by the Islamic Republic of Iran 
Meteorological Organization (IRIMO)s for Tehran Mehrabad, WMO number 
407540, latitude 35.683N, longitude 51.317E, elevation 1190.8 meters, 
time zone GMT+3.50.

The IRIMO weather data consists of 3-hour records of dry-bulb, wet-bulb, 
and dewpoint temperature, relative humidity, pressure, wind speed and 
direction, and cloud amount. Total and direct normal solar radiation has 
been estimated using the Zhang-Huang model based on the reported cloud 
cover, temperature change over 3 hours, relative humidity, and wind speed.

For the TEHR1TMY weather file, typical months were selected from 30 
years of weather data from 1973 through 2003.  The 12 typical months 
were taken from the following years: 1996, 1988, 1987, 1991, 1976, 1993, 
1985, 2002, 1988, 1981, 1987, 1979 For the TEHR2TMY weather file, 
typical months were selected from the most recent twelve years of 
weather data from 1992 through 2003.  The 12 typical months were taken 
from the following years: 1999, 2003, 2003, 1995, 1994, 1995, 1997, 
1996, 2003, 2001, 2002, 1997.

Because the typical months have been selected from more recent years, 
the TEHR2TMY weather file is somewhat warmer, with lower Heating Degree 
Days and higher Cooling Degree Days, than the TEHR1TMY weather file. The 
amount of solar radiation is similar between the two files (see table 
below).

	                      		    TEHR1TMY	THER2TMY
18C Heating Degree-days				1739	1517
18C Cooling Degree-days				1526	1565
Average Daily Direct Solar Radiation (Wh/m2)	5573	5400
Average Daily Global Solar Radiation (Wh/m2)	5091	5018

Message-ID: <69a9bc0a0907290554y5ebaf577t3e3741426e9444a9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

Is anyone aware of a program that can model hourly outputs for a solar hot
water system?  I would prefer something that can accept a TMY2 or TMY3
weather file and just gives me the hourly heat output based on SHW panel,
inlet and outlet temperatures, angle and azumith.  I'll handle the load
side, including thermal storage, etc.

Thanks,

In my opinion, TRNSYS is probably the best program to handle your stated
solar domestic hot water simulation needs - at timesteps of an hour all
the way down below a second if you need that type of resolution.  But it
can also do the entire balance of system (thermal storage, controls,
interaction with the building, etc.). However, it's a bit on the pricey
side if you're only going to be using it for one project.

Give us a call if you'd like to discuss your project.  We do a lot of
solar thermal projects and could help answer some of your modeling
questions.  Good luck with your project.

Karen,

Transys is ideal for that type of analysis.  Another (cheaper) option to
consider would be WATSUN from Natural Resources Canada.  It comes with
.TMY for Canadian sites -- I do not know about compatibility with US .TMY
data.  Price is right though.

WATSUN is available (for free) here:

http://canmetenergy-canmetenergie.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca/eng/software_tools/watsun.html

I have not played much with it but it does produce hourly results to a
text file. Note that it only uses SI units.

Cheers,
Brian

Hi All,

Thanks for all the responses.  I will probably use WATSUN for this project,
but could use a hand with something:

for "Collector Test Data" the program requires that I enter in some test
parameters for the solar panel:

A (no units)
B (1/C)
C (W/m2/C)
D (W/m2/C2)
E (W/m2)

This data is used in the following formula:

Q = Area ((A + B dT) Akt H - (C + D dT) dT - E)

where:

Akt is the incidence angle modifier
H is the incoming solar radiation
dT is the temperature difference between the collector inlet and ambient air

The help file indicates that I should be able to get these numbers from the
manufacturer or from a testing agency, however, the data I have found
includes variables A, C and D, but not B and E according to test
EN-12975-1,2:2004.  Unfortunately the Help file gives no indication of what
test these numbers should come from or any other information.

Can anyone give me a hand here?

Thanks,

There are also the SPF tests, which give the same parameters, but again, not
B and E.

Linda,

As I know TMY data in .BIN format for cities of Iran is still unavailable.
However you have some other choices:

1. create them from available data. You can find climatic statics of
different cities of Iran here:
(http://www.irimo.ir/english/monthly&annual/map/index.asp<http://www.irimo.ir/english/monthly&annual/map/index.asp>).
Select the province on the map to find the available synoptic and
climatology stations. Then you can get different reports as you wish.

2. Already I have data of some cities of Iran in .TMY format, which are
generated from Metheonorm (http://www.meteonorm.com/pages/en/meteonorm.php).
There are some differences between these data and the one you can find in
the first address, but they are generally acceptable except in rainfall
data. Let me know exactly which cities are you looking for. So I send you
the files.

3. There is a research project under study at BHRC to create TMY files from
climatic statics data for cities of Iran. If you tell me the cities I will
ask them if they have the file or not? And if they can provide it for you or
not?

4. Finally, if you want the data JUST for Tehran you can find the .epw file
at the EnergyPlus website.

Hope this helps,

Mostapha

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Savings By Design using eQuest
Message-ID: <691341.72537.qm@web45105.mail.sp1.yahoo.com>


Dear all, 

Can eQuest 3.6 do Savings By Design analysis? If so, how to do it in eQuest? I didn't find any answer to this in the previous posts. Would appreciate it if anyone can give some suggestions. 

Thank you!

Best regards, 

Anna

Subject: [Bldg-sim] using eQUEST for research in an environmental chamber
Message-ID: <430248.60572.qm@web53307.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

We are using an environmental chamber to test an experimental air handler unit configuration.
I have modelled a building with an interior zone that is modelled after the environmental chamber.

Is there a way to simply lock the rest of the building at room temperature, since the?experimental air handler only conditions the environmental chamber?
??
Also, we will be using two heating coils in the air handler, one electric, and one that uses a flow of propylene-glycol mix heated in solar panels. 
Is there a decent way to model this air handler configuration with eQUEST?

Also, do you all think that eQUEST is an acceptable way to simulate air handler performance on an hourly basis for a tiny room, or is it really limited to large buildings?

thanks,
Jacob

Hi All,

I was wondering if anyone can give me some guidance upon saving results in
xls from .sim output file. 
My problem: Is it possible to output meter data to xls format from eQuest.
Also can parts of the .sim file be generated in xls format?
If I were to take the current xls report that eQuest generates, it does not
have meter data say a chilled water meter or so, I wanted to know where is
all this being set up.

I appreciate any help that I can get on this.

Thanks 
Neetu

Regarding the output file being generated in .xls, I am not sure.

To save in .xls you can always follow these steps:

1) Copy the .sim file text and paste into simple word editor such as
Notepad. Save the file as a .dat.
2) Open Excel and import data from .dat file.

Hope this was not the obvious answer you are trying to avoid.

Thanks,

Ryan Schmidt

Neetu,

When you open the .sim file with D2SimViewer, click "Hourly Results" in
the upper right. An Excel file is generated and opened. If you want
additional information to show up, create a new Hourly Report Block from
the Component Tree in the Project & Site module in DD Edit mode.

Bill

Hello Neetu,

We have generated macros that copy portions of the SIM file into a Word
document and other macros that take the Word document and paste it into
Excel.  Once in Excel, other macros format the data so that the results
always fall into specific cells.  The macros are not terribly difficult to
develop but some cleverness is required.  It's a good intern project.

Message-ID: <394572.58747.qm@web53303.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

We are using an environmental chamber to test an experimental air handler unit configuration.
I have modelled a building with an interior zone that is modelled after the environmental chamber.

This model is satisfactorily calibrated to actual data at a setpoint of 77 degrees Fahrenheit and 45% rel hum,
but at different setpoints the model no longer agrees with actual power consumption data.
Is there a way to control chiller power usage over a range of operating conditions?
