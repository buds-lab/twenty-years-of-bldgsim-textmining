Dear simulators,

 

The time is here again to submit articles and announcements for the upcoming
issue of IBPSA News (October 2013).  As usual, it would be good to receive
an announcement from each IBPSA Affiliate as to activities that have taken
place in their region, including conferences and meetings. Items related to
software news are also encouraged: new releases, updates, new versions,
training seminars, notable projects, etc. - all gratefully received. 

 

Please send the article(s) to me at your earliest convenience so they arrive
before 15th September 2013, if possible.

 

Many thanks for your assistance and contributions.

 

I look forward to seeing you in Chambery!

 

Best regards,

I agree Robert!

The push to clarify the boundaries between LEED, the 90.1 mandatory requirements, and demonstrating compliance with 90.1 as a standard was driven by other language.  The foundation of your query is sound:  these vestibule requirements are indeed part of the mandatory requirements LEED mandates through EAp2.

Perhaps by lucky circumstance (?),  I often find myself advising my architects and envelope designers what 90.1/IECC truly require for a given project & jurisdiction, and more often than not I tend to find one or more building entries fall into those 90.1 exceptions.  There are certainly circumstances and projects that will require a vestibule at each entry, and I don?t mean to say that isn?t a possibility.  I merely hope to encourage those approaching this to thoroughly review those passages, so that nobody misses an applicable exception.

Regards,

~Nick

In my original post I said "Since LEED requires compliance with ASHRAE 90.1 Mandatory measures...".  I believe this is correct, at least as far as Architectural, Mechanical and Electrical mandatory requirements are concerned.

And yes, I realize that there are exceptions for doors not used as entries (emergency only or exit only?) and for doors leading into spaces less than 3000 sq. ft.  Also for buildings less than four stories under 10,000 sq. ft. in CZ 3 or 4.  And for mild climates.  I do not believe any of these would apply to the building I am working on, but I do appreciate the options.  Including revolving doors!

I concur with the advice to read the requirements more carefully ? in almost no case is a vestibule required at every door, when they are required.

Take care and recognize that an Appendix G model is NOT a method to show code compliance.  It?s a procedure for benchmarking the building performance for design which exceeds the minimum requirements of the standard.  The first sections of Appendix G provide a concise overview.

You can evaluate the effect a vestibule or not as already discussed ? in function this should simply reduce scheduled infiltration.  That said, I do not believe any Appendix G model should have the proposed and baseline models differing with respect to having a vestibule.  I think table G3.1 is pretty clear that the baseline model is to match the proposed with respect to space/thermal block configuration and arrangement.

Finally, just to drive an extra wedge into the commentary ? while the specified mandatory sections (#.4?) ARE required of the design for a LEED project, to pass EAp2, in my humble opinion it?s incorrect (or at least a stretch) to say LEED requires demonstrating compliance with 90.1.

In sum, to the extent vestibules are required (review the sections and exceptions carefully), a LEED project must by design include them in the proposed design.  In turn, the proposed model should incorporate the vestibule in the form of a distinct thermal block (zone/space), to match the actual design.  In turn, the same edits should be applied to the baseline model as it?s supposed to match the proposed model in this regard.

If the vestibules will be designed to be conditioned by the same systems handling the surrounding spaces, you might make the case that it?s a reasonable thing to not model them explicitly as a separated space (modeler has the prerogative to identify and assert where such spatial approximations are appropriate), but in preliminary LEED submission I?d advise making that decision and case clear to the reviewer in your documentation so if it isn?t acceptable you have the opportunity to make the corrections per above prior to final submission.

Robert,
Did you notice the 7 exceptions to section 5.4.3.4?  One of them may apply to you?
As far as modeling goes, a vestibule is principally an infiltration control technique, so I suppose that you could argue for reduced infiltration when vestibules are present.  I am unaware of any research or other information about how they may affect infiltration.  Since infiltration is such a guessing game, I never apply any special curves for vestibules.
p.s., the IECC 2012 (Int?l Energy Conservation Code) includes mandatory envelope and infiltration testing and criteria.  This will probably be a game changer for the construction industry in areas that adopt this code and will definitely affect the energy models prepared for those projects.

Any of the mandatory requirements in Standard 90.1 must be included in your building design and cannot be traded off using a performance approach.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Vestibule Modeling



I see that ASHRAE 90.1 requires a vestibule in most cases, but I don't
know if it is modeled or if it is just mandatory.  It would seem to me
that if it was modeled, showing compliance using modeling, without a
vestibule, would be OK (you would make it up somewhere else in the
envelope).  Does anybody know if the vestibule is modeled anywhere, and
how to take it out or put it in?

Since LEED requires compliance with ASHRAE 90.1 Mandatory measures, this
makes a vestibule a mandatory requirement unless I can model it with and
without.  If this is even possible.

Otherwise we must put in a vestibule to comply with LEED.


Is this correct?  Does anybody have other thoughts or ideas?  We have a
very efficient building, modeled without the vestibule in Climate Zone
3B.  I would think that we could take a heating penalty and not install
a vestibule AT EVERY DOOR.


I appreciate your thinking about this.

FYI.

It seems like your simulation is not working. Check to see if you have the system shut-off, or ASSIGNED air flows   = 0. You also may not have linked zones to systems.

Dear Energy Modelers,

I am doing an office building simulation. The proposed building is VAV system with electric heating source. While the baseline is system 6 Packaged VAV with PFP Boxes.
The simulation run for the proposed building came across results with very strange unmet load hours "HOURS ANY ZONE ABOVE COOLING THROTTLING RANGE  =  8760". On other hand the baseline is ok.
I would like to know if there is a way to verify such strange result. Furthermore, the proposed building has Zone Thermostat Throttle Range 5?R, and Indoor Design Temp. 72 F/70 F Cooling/Heating.
I would greatly appreciate your thoughts on this matter.

Dear Ellen,
I'll bet that costs are a moving target as modelers become more experienced, software improves and expectations evolve.
I also think that client expectations for an energy model are often exceptionally vague.  Sometimes, it's just "Get me LEED points" with little or no concern for whether it is a good model and will be useful for, say, M&V efforts.  We always assume that the client will be able to use our models for M&V, but I doubt that's a universal attitude.  So far as we can tell, there are energy models prepared for the US EPACT tax credits which are MUCH less costly than seems possible for a detailed model - how can a client tell what they're getting unless they are very sophisticated?
Please share whatever you learn - I'm fairly sure my company is very competitive for M&V-grade models, but it's hard to know if you're either worse than average or much better!

Mr. Dirkes is correct, however I have found poorly documented tenant 
improvements to be even more typical if you need zone by zone modeling 
for some reason.

It occurs to me that there are several programs right here in California 
where you are located, Philip, that struggle with this routinely.  On 
the residential side, programs such as the CalRatePro supported utility 
programs need to model existing buildings where drawings may be 
difficult or impossible to obtain.  On the non-residential side, utility 
rebate programs here in California are likely to require a model to 
predict savings.  Multi-Family upgrade programs like the California Tax 
Credit Allocation Committee (google TCAC) incentive programs deal with 
this as well.  Although you may be familiar with these programs, and 
these programs may actually be at the root of your question, discussing 
this with local consultants and providers, in confidence, might be a 
good way to get information. Resources might include frequent utility 
rebate partners, CALCERTS, EnergySoft, and consultants such as myself.

I would be willing to discuss this with you if you wish.

Hello,

EnergyPlus does not yet fully include the calculation to comply with ISO
7730 Thermal Comfort model. But I came to know that there are some
post-processing tools which inputs the Environmental as well Personal
parameters of thermal comfort, and directly shows compliance with ISO 7730.
If someone is aware of such tools, it would be great if you can share the
info. Thanks!

An interesting variable for a vestibule is the frequency of use.

How do you model a vestibule for a shopping center with a nearly continuous stream of people entering and exiting compared to a vestibule for an office building where the traffic is very low.

I was designing an HVAC system for a 600 sqft guard office in a cold climate. I couldn't find much information on how to model (or design) the system to account for the extremely frequent opening and closing of the door.

In my original post I said "Since LEED requires compliance with ASHRAE 90.1 Mandatory measures...".  I believe this is correct, at least as far as Architectural, Mechanical and Electrical mandatory requirements are concerned.

And yes, I realize that there are exceptions for doors not used as entries (emergency only or exit only?) and for doors leading into spaces less than 3000 sq. ft.  Also for buildings less than four stories under 10,000 sq. ft. in CZ 3 or 4.  And for mild climates.  I do not believe any of these would apply to the building I am working on, but I do appreciate the options.  Including revolving doors!

	I concur with the advice to read the requirements more carefully ? in almost no case is a vestibule required at every door, when they are required.

	 

	Take care and recognize that an Appendix G model is NOT a method to show code compliance.  It?s a procedure for benchmarking the building performance for design which exceeds the minimum requirements of the standard.  The first sections of Appendix G provide a concise overview.

	 

	You can evaluate the effect a vestibule or not as already discussed ? in function this should simply reduce scheduled infiltration.  That said, I do not believe any Appendix G model should have the proposed and baseline models differing with respect to having a vestibule.  I think table G3.1 is pretty clear that the baseline model is to match the proposed with respect to space/thermal block configuration and arrangement.

	 

	Finally, just to drive an extra wedge into the commentary ? while the specified mandatory sections (#.4?) ARE required of the design for a LEED project, to pass EAp2, in my humble opinion it?s incorrect (or at least a stretch) to say LEED requires demonstrating compliance with 90.1. 

	 

	In sum, to the extent vestibules are required (review the sections and exceptions carefully), a LEED project must by design include them in the proposed design.  In turn, the proposed model should incorporate the vestibule in the form of a distinct thermal block (zone/space), to match the actual design.  In turn, the same edits should be applied to the baseline model as it?s supposed to match the proposed model in this regard.  

	 

	If the vestibules will be designed to be conditioned by the same systems handling the surrounding spaces, you might make the case that it?s a reasonable thing to not model them explicitly as a separated space (modeler has the prerogative to identify and assert where such spatial approximations are appropriate), but in preliminary LEED submission I?d advise making that decision and case clear to the reviewer in your documentation so if it isn?t acceptable you have the opportunity to make the corrections per above prior to final submission.

	Robert,

	Did you notice the 7 exceptions to section 5.4.3.4?  One of them may apply to you?

	As far as modeling goes, a vestibule is principally an infiltration control technique, so I suppose that you could argue for reduced infiltration when vestibules are present.  I am unaware of any research or other information about how they may affect infiltration.  Since infiltration is such a guessing game, I never apply any special curves for vestibules.

	p.s., the IECC 2012 (Int?l Energy Conservation Code) includes mandatory envelope and infiltration testing and criteria.  This will probably be a game changer for the construction industry in areas that adopt this code and will definitely affect the energy models prepared for those projects.

	I see that ASHRAE 90.1 requires a vestibule in most cases, but I don't
	know if it is modeled or if it is just mandatory.  It would seem to me
	that if it was modeled, showing compliance using modeling, without a
	vestibule, would be OK (you would make it up somewhere else in the
	envelope).  Does anybody know if the vestibule is modeled anywhere, and
	how to take it out or put it in?
	
	Since LEED requires compliance with ASHRAE 90.1 Mandatory measures, this
	makes a vestibule a mandatory requirement unless I can model it with and
	without.  If this is even possible.
	
	Otherwise we must put in a vestibule to comply with LEED.
	
	
	Is this correct?  Does anybody have other thoughts or ideas?  We have a
	very efficient building, modeled without the vestibule in Climate Zone
	3B.  I would think that we could take a heating penalty and not install
	a vestibule AT EVERY DOOR.
	
	
	I appreciate your thinking about this.

There have been a few discussion in the past across the [bldg.-sim] and [equest-users] lists covering costs and fee structures for energy modeling services.  Attached are a few selected threads that should be worthwhile reads from the bottom-up.  The "Response & Statement..." thread in particular diverged into many different directions (It was a broad topic of conversation to start, to be fair) - a search of the archives will lead you to a number of other responses if you should find the content matter interesting.

As someone who writes proposals, I REALLY wish there were an easy answer, but alas every project / client is unique!  Coming to a reasonable estimate typically requires digging hard at what information is (or will become) readily available, clear definition & statement of expectations, and an honest introspective assessment of how efficiently the modeling staff can accomplish the known challenges, and much the modelers' time is worth.  These are all tricky propositions in and of themselves.

When limited/no resources are available - you have to consider costs of field-verification and creating what you need for the intended goals.  Pricing the costs of developing "what you know you don't know" is always going to involve some educated guesswork.  Anecdotally, I can recall an SD phase exercise exploring building massing for a large renovation, and we had only fragmented info to work from in the way of plans.  After a trip to the site and a walk of the perimeter & courtyards snapping lots of shots from different perspectives, I constructed a massing model in Sketchup from the photos themselves (this is actually kinda fun - here's a video showing the principles of the procedure<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSuDoX8SPtU>).  This "SD" model was used directly at that stage alonside the free IES-VE Sketchup plugins, and was later used as a basis for developing design plans and a more involved series of eQuest model studies.  Main point being: this procedure is something I had to develop 'on the fly,' and encountering the same challenge in the future I'll have a good idea of what this entails, but often we can only work from the pool of experience we have and throw together a number that seems reasonable on paper.  If you're disciplined about reviewing the estimates and assumptions you make at the close of a project, you'll grow in your ability to assess and accurately quote future work.

Regards,

~Nick

* * * Call for papers for CIBSE ASHRAE Technical Symposium - Dublin 2014 * * *

**Moving to a New World of Building Systems Performance**

Recognising that system and plant performance is a global issue this joint CIBSE and ASHRAE symposium will give a platform to the latest practice and research from around the world in active and passive building systems that will shape an effective future for the built environment with minimum resource impact.

The fourth annual Technical Symposium will take place on 3rd-4th April 2014 in Dublin and aims to encourage the participation of young and experienced researchers and industry practitioners to share experiences and develop networks.

This invitation is for papers concerning research and development that may address ...
*    Enhanced building engineering solutions through modeling and prediction
*    Innovation in passive and active building systems
*    Design and operation of future cities
*    Improving the operation of the built environment
*    Maintaining and improving legacy building systems
*    The development and impact of benchmarks, standards and regulatory measures
*    Communication, skills and workforce development

This list is not exhaustive but provides the intended context of the Technical Symposium that will focus on aspects that are of interest to CIBSE and ASHRAE members. Material is welcomed based on recent or current research and application as well as the actual or potential impact of that research on the built environment.

For the first time this year there are additionally opportunities for the presentation of relevant case studies supported by keynotes (as opposed to a formal paper).

All papers will be peer reviewed and published electronically through CIBSE. Selected papers may be developed for publication in BSERT.

*Abstracts*

*    specific email address of principal author
*    abstract of maximum 250 words in English, the official symposium language
*    note whether it is a proposed paper (to be orally or poster presented) OR a case study

*Timetable*
- Early October 2013 - Authors selected to proceed will be advised and specifically invited to prepare draft material suitable for oral or for poster delivery.
- 15th November 2013 - Selected authors submit draft manuscripts of full paper (between 3000 and 5000 words), or the draft poster, or case study keynotes for peer review
- Mid December 2013 - Authors receive reviewers' comments and develop final submission following review, and subject to acceptance by the reviewers/technical committee.

It's a heat pump, so I'm thinking it's just a mismatch in heating and 
cooling capacities, but the numbers don't match what I entered.


I'm looking in what I have now...

Sukreet,

I haven't seen much on courthouses, but offices are pretty well covered in
the literature. Here are links to a couple of relevant studies:

Assessment of the Technical Potential for Achieving Net Zero-Energy
Buildings in the Commercial
Sector<http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy08osti/41957.pdf>is a modeling study
by NREL.
A Look at the Costs and Features of Zero Energy Commercial
Buildings<http://newbuildings.org/sites/default/files/GettingtoZeroReport_0.pdf>is
a report by the New Buildings Institute with a good collection of case
studies.

Hope this helps as a starter; I'm surprised no one else has chimed in yet...

Sam

Sukreet,

Ditto on your presentation comparing E+ and Equest.

My thought was that many federal buildings are pretty typical office
buildings so you could use the results for office buildings in those
reports as a pretty good proxy.

For GSA buildings (I just remembered), there's the report Assessing Green
Building Performance: A Post Occupancy Evaluation of 12 GSA
Buildings<http://www.gsa.gov/graphics/pbs/GSA_AssessGreen_white_paper.pdf>.
The link is to the white paper, while there's a more thorough full report
here. <http://www.gsa.gov/graphics/pbs/GSA_Assessing_Green_Full_Report.pdf>

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Roof Conduction Load
Message-ID: <CA+7A=v4qh_-pT8Yv6+HBQpAUMe20jWPEn0R3ZK_hJ+ab639ZLQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I am doing an energy simulation model in eQuest. I noticed that the
load through roof conduction in LS-C is zero where as in LS-B (for
plenum space) it is showing some load.

As per my understanding this load should appear in LS-C also.

Also, if I reduce the U value of the roof, the load through roof
reduces and can be accounted in LS-B only (plenum space).

Refer attached LS-C and LS-B reports.

Any help will be appreciated.


Thanks & Regards

Hi,

This happens because the load calculation is made with a fixed temperature
(see picture). All the spaces, include plenum zones, have the same
temperature by default (70?F). So, all roof load appears in the plenum
spaces. To considerate the roof load, you have to change this temperature in
plenum spaces and a part of roof load will appear like "internal surface
conduction". But I'm not sure if this is a good practice. Maybe someone else
has an opinion about that.

Message-ID: <CAJaiD7o7=KZ9TQxwOK9ceTenhchRSE2OwDJ2Tqnq2U9jY6qBjw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

On a large warehouse (shipping & distribution center) project, we're told
by our consultant that the 650,000 square feet warehouse component is being
designed to be ventilated (OA) at 0.06 cfm/sf. There are small portions
with multiple levels, total ventilation CFM ends up being close to 60,000.
(we're told by our consultant that this is the code minimum). CO2 sensors
are being planned to bring the OA levels down, not yet sure what the
thresholds are.

The office component that is a tenth in square footage but roughly equal
occupancy as the warehouse, results in around 15,000 CFM ventilation.

While we generally trust our consultant's professional judgement, the
design team is concerned that the warehouse ventilation might be over
designed. Is anyone aware of workarounds that meet code but effectively
optimize the ventilation/OA rates in such large warehouse settings?

Thank you,
Ramana Koti.

Take a look at ASHRAE 62.2, it establishes minimum ventilation rates for
various occupancies.

Ramana, code minimum is code minimum, no working around that.

0.06 cfm/ft2 is the right value for warehouse. And it is not CO2 dependant,  such sensors do bot apply in those case. Why ventilation is required is to vent out pollutants emitted by the stored goods.

Office space May benefit from sensors, but that is not recommended for spaces with population density < 25 #/1000ft2.

At first reading, your consultants are reading correctly ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or later). Keep trusting them.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] DOAS w/ VAV
Message-ID: <CAHRH_9OVdM2saEyY9QaGrnsG_38wYuMaBaTcjNL2nt7U6PN5nQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I'm modeling a Building that has a Dedicated Outdoor Air system, this
outdoor air
is distributed for a central air system w/ VAV in each floor and then the
mixed and conditioned
air is distribuited by a single duct for each zone. The DOAS has a specific
chiller for it with a lower temperature for the chilled water, comparing to
the chillers that supplies other systems.
In the energyplus's templates doesn't has this kind of system, because you
can't have a DOAS with VAV (in this templates).

Does anyone knows how to model this system?


Thanks,

Cicero.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Want to know what optimisation is about? Try jEPlus+EA
	v1.4
Message-ID: <770DA51B8CC79343A32830010D6E379A10C05E5D@PJWXMB-0001L.LEC-ADMIN.dmu.ac.uk>

Dear all,

If you've heard too much about optimisation but never seen one in action, it is probably time to try your hands on jEPlus+EA. The brand new v1.4 is much more grown-up compared to the previous version. For one thing, it has now a proper GUI that allows you do more or less everything in one place... Here are some key features:
  * A full-fledged optimisation tool for EnergyPlus users
  * Out-of-the-box support for jEPlus projects, with user-defined objective functions
  * Highly efficient multi-objective (up to 10!) optimisation method based on a customized NSGA-II
  * Built-in remote simulation function through the JESS Client
  * A scatter plot for inspecting individual solutions
  * Frequency histograms for visualizing distribution of variables within the discovered solutions
  * A table view for easy sorting and exporting (through copy-and-paste) of results
  * Automatically saves solution data to avoid loss of work during a long run
  * And, of course, full-featured command-line interface for automated optimisation tasks
Screenshots illustrating the key features can be found here: http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jeplus/wiki/doku.php?id=docs:jeplus_ea:features_1_4. We are still working on the user's manual. However, the software is available, now. Please register on the website to download it. ...and, yes, it is "free".

Best wishes,

Yi

You can also submit new questions to the exam for a portion of the credit.

The USGBC has an extensive library of educational content, some of which are free. (Not everything from USGBC would apply to BEMP of course, but some might.)

Local ASHRAE, USGBC, or IBPSA-USA chapters might have live events for a nominal cost.

IBPSA-USA chapters also host online events, these should qualify.

If you are a PE or LEED AP with specialty the CEU credits you earn to support those will sometimes overlap with BEMP topics.

Hi All,

The LS-C report comes from the LOADS simulation portion of DOE 2.2. The
plenum reference temperature used in LOADS is adjusted in the SYSTEMS
portion of the program and the loads in the spaces adjacent to the plenum
are corrected
correspondingly.

Technically LEED projects are required to use the VRP method (not the IAQ
method) to determine the minimum required ventilation airflows for projects.

Dear All,
 
On a large warehouse (shipping & distribution center) project, we're told by
our consultant that the 650,000 square feet warehouse component is being
designed to be ventilated (OA) at 0.06 cfm/sf. There are small portions with
multiple levels, total ventilation CFM ends up being close to 60,000. (we're
told by our consultant that this is the code minimum). CO2 sensors are being
planned to bring the OA levels down, not yet sure what the thresholds are.
 
The office component that is a tenth in square footage but roughly equal
occupancy as the warehouse, results in around 15,000 CFM ventilation. 
 
While we generally trust our consultant's professional judgement, the design
team is concerned that the warehouse ventilation might be over designed. Is
anyone aware of workarounds that meet code but effectively optimize the
ventilation/OA rates in such large warehouse settings?
 
Thank you,

Just to repeat what David and Rodrigo have already sad, DOE-2 calculates conduction loads 
in a two step process. In LOADS, a constant reference temperature is specified, which 
DOE-2 uses to calculate the amount of heat flow through the surfaces. This is the LOADS 
loads summarized in the LS-E and LS-F reports.  In SYSTEMS, DOE-2 calculates the true 
temperature of the zone based on the loads passed from LOADS, as well as the actions of 
the HVAC system.  In the course of this calculation, the heat flows ("loads") from LOADS 
are adjusted, but this is not done surface by surface, but in total using the so-called 
"Zone Conductance" times the difference between the actual zone temperature and the 
reference temperature used in LOADS.  At this point, heat flows through internal walls are 
also considered, using the  difference between this hour's zone temperature and the 
previous hour's zone temperature of the adjacent space, e.g., the Attic or Plenum.  If you 
are interested in this number, I believe it can be extracted in an hourly report.

In reference to Rodrigo's question, I don't see any benefit in forcing a heat flow between 
the room and the attic by using different reference temperatures.   You will simply get a 
constant heat flow at that temperature difference throughout the simulation. In reality, 
attics are generally colder than the room in the winter and warmer than the room in the 
summer, so the derived heat flow with this temperature difference doesn't get you any 
closer to reality, in my opinion.

Joe, Just wondering,  given your expertise how would you compare this to
the heat balance method.., and what do you think is more realistic?

Objet : [Equest-users] Roof Conduction Load



Hi All,



I am doing an energy simulation model in eQuest. I noticed that the load through roof conduction in LS-C is zero where as in LS-B (for plenum space) it is showing some load.



As per my understanding this load should appear in LS-C also.

Also, if I reduce the U value of the roof, the load through roof reduces and can be accounted in LS-B only (plenum space).



Refer attached LS-C and LS-B reports.

Any help will be appreciated.





Thanks & Regards

Jeremiah,

Your  question is not quite on the mark because what I've described is downstream from the 
calculation of room loads where techniques such as the Weighting Factor or the Heat 
Balance methods come into play.   Before I get to that issue, though, I want to point out 
that the "Adjust Loads" procedure I described is done automatically by DOE-2 and totally 
invisible to the User;  I did so only to explain whyBhartendu (the original poster) was 
not seeing any conduction loads through the ceiling.

Now, back to this "Adjust Loads" procedure, there is no simulation program I know of that 
solves simultaneously for the heat flows and the zone temperature.  DOE-2 does it in the 
two-step way that others and I have just described. When you said "compared to the Heat 
Balance Method", I assume you're thinking of EnergyPlus.  So, how does EnergyPlus meet 
this problem?  Whereas DOE-2 does one year of LOADS and then one year of SYSTEMS, 
EnergyPlus does them in the same time step, but also sequentially. Therefore,  EnergyPlus 
calculates the heat flows using the zone temperature from the previous time step which are 
then used in its HVAC simulation without adjustment. This should be okay when zone 
temperatures don't change, but what about at morning start-up when temperatures could 
change by 5-10 F within one hour?  I've always wondered whether that's why EnergyPlus 
gives much lower heating loads in mild California climates than does DOE-2?  As far as 
which procedure is "more realistic", I can't say.

HI,

I faced a similar situation When I was modeling perimeter versus interior
systems for an office floor plate, I saw that each zone and its loads are
isolated in the calculations and eQUEST does not factor any sort of heat
transfer between zones (adiabatic) in eQUEST. So for example if there is
curtain wall facade, the solar loads only applied to that exterior zone and
did not transfer into the interior zones. We therefore encountered issues
with oversizing for the non-exterior zones of the office space when
modeling as designed.

As I understand this appears to be case with roof loads being transferred
to plenums only and not the occupied space below as well.

I dont remember exactly how we resolved this and infact I think we took
that oversizing penalty in our model. But one of the suggestions we were
toying with was that we make an opening or model the internal wall as an
air film.

OK folks, the Radiance Workshop recordings are now available on NREL's OpenStudio YouTube channel!

We split the morning and afternoon programs from each day into their own streams, plus there is one for the NREL campus panel discussion from Tuesday afternoon. The entire 18 hours(!) of content can be accessed in order from the following playlist link:

http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPk2tlcZM0gydvEW0VFgZLZ3S8eSbi-cx

Unfortunately the recording timed out early on some days, so Kera Lagios' DIVA for Rhino demo is unceremoniously halted about halfway through, and the OpenStudio demo does not appear at all. Jack DeValpine makes a fast exit at the end of day two as well. Apologies all around on that score. With compressed video and small type being what they are, you also might want to avail yourself of the high resolution copies of all the presenter slide decks Andy McNeil and LBNL have made available at radiance-online.org:

http://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2013-golden-co

We left the dead time during the coffee breaks in the streams, so you can pretend you were actually there. Just play back, and during the breaks make small talk about the 5-phase method with your cat. 

One last time, I want to say it was a pleasure and an honor to be able to host the workshop this year. Enjoy!

Is it an existing building? If so, another way to approach it would be to get an idea of the baseline(non-heating) natural gas usage from the utility data(pick a late spring or early fall month when school is in session), which would be made up of domestic hot water + cooking. Dhw is easier to estimate per person, and subtracting that, you could get an idea of the cooking use(I know you're not using eQuest, but you could start w an eQuest default for per person hot water use in a school) . Both cooking + dhw are probably fairly small.

Hello Mr. Passerini,

Not done it yet in a project but seems like process load to me - one that would remain same in both the proposed and baseline.

That said, one could check with the school canteen staff what the rate of consumption is (per child) if the existing school facility does it's cooking on same fuel?!

Or else, if it helps as a wild indicator - here in India, my family of 2 adults and 2 kids (age 6 and 2) consumes roughly 30 kg of LPG (liquified petroleum gas) for 2 months. We cook 1 to 2 times in a day using LPG with bit of reheating /cooking done using the microwave and toaster/ mixer used mostly in the mornings. You will need to look up the calorific value of LPG versus natural gas and run some back-of-the-envelope calculations to extrapolate day-time US school cooking requirements from an Indian household consumption for 3ish-member family for their daily meals over 2 months.

It will be good for you to have a few other reference points. And it'll be good to know what and how you crack it....

best,
Neeraj

Is it an existing building? If so, another way to approach it would be to get an idea of the baseline(non-heating) natural gas usage from the utility data(pick a late spring or early fall month when school is in session), which would be made up of domestic hot water + cooking. Dhw is easier to estimate per person, and subtracting that, you could get an idea of the cooking use(I know you're not using eQuest, but you could start w an eQuest default for per person hot water use in a school) . Both cooking + dhw are probably fairly small.

Hi;

I would suggest  AO Smith water heater and boiler  manufacturer sizing 
software available on line at

http://www.hotwatersizing.com/Application.aspx


I have designed and installed several projects including an office 
building cafeteria with gas fired
water heaters combined with a 750 gallon per day Solar thermal array. 
using AO Smith.  Good Stuff.

bye.

I've been keeping this in my bookmarks for my next commercial kitchen to model:
http://www.fishnick.com/design/resources/leed/

The spreadsheet here has lots of collected data on typical/baseline kitchen equipment.  More on their website to read up on to see where they're coming from.

	Tools' White Paper
Message-ID: <CA+bpH8-BrRfpkQiwVbARp2sfX0ZG6UAxJq0cKnvJkCeaDjgrNg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Building Simulation Community,

We are beginning to update and expand the 'Contrasting Capabilities of
Building Energy Performance Simulation
Programs'<http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/tools_directory/pdfs/contrasting_the_capabilities_of_building_energy_performance_simulation_programs_v1.0.pdf>to:

- include more detail on simulation engines and their underlying solution
methods

- explictly separate interface capabilities from calculations

- expand to new simulation domains and scopes of tools
The focus will be on providing as much comparable information about various
simulation engines, interfaces, and methods as possible. We expect
significantly expanded, in-depth description of the various tools.

Why are we updating it?  It's been almost a decade and the journal verison
of this (Building and Environment Vol 43 Issue 4, pgs 661-673) has been
cited more than 450 times.

If you are a software developer and at the Building Simulation 2013
conference in Chambery this week, please find Jon Hand or Dru Crawley for
further information.  If you are a user interested in providing reality
checks for developer-provided information, we'd also like to hear from
you.  If you are not at the Building Simulation Conference, please contact
Jon or Dru by email.
What will the final product be?  We plan an interactive web site, a PDF
white paper, and journal articles.  The web version will be interactive
with links to web sites of the specific tools, links to published papers,
and more in-depth discussion than possible in a white paper. By posting on
a web site, it can be a living document which can be updated over time.

Hi,



Does anyone know of any current tools that use the BIN method? I am
imagining something that both processes weather data into BINs (taking into
account occupied versus unoccupied times), and maybe includes some
templates for common energy efficiency measures?



Thanks,

Mike

You could try Binmaker Pro from InterEnergy.
No templates but I believe you can define hours.

Back in the day, I used a BASIC program called ASEAM that was developed by an ASHRAE research project.  It was capable of modeling only a single zone and limited number of HVAC systems (as I recall). I think I found a version of it online a few years ago and then decided I'd probably not use it, and no longer have it.  You may be able to find it....  ASEAM (A Simplified Energy Analysis Method) uses a modified bin method approach for energy calcs.

I have a program called TMY2BIN which converts freely available TMY2 hourly weather files into bin weather files for use in simplified energy calculations.  It does allow you to define occupancy hours.  Cost is $25  Check it out at: http://www.hvacware.net

I do not have any calculations for common ECM's that use this bin weather data.  That's why you get the big bucks.

Does anyone know of any current tools that use the BIN method? I am imagining something that both processes weather data into BINs (taking into account occupied versus unoccupied times), and maybe includes some templates for common energy efficiency measures?

I also recall ASEAM from back in the mid-1980's, when it was thought to be an easier 
program to teach than DOE-2 for
a USAID project to help ASEAN countries develop building energy standards.  Back in those 
days, ASHRAE TC 4.7 was quite
involved in refining the modified  bin calculation method that got known as the TC 4.7 
Simplified Energy Analysis Procedure.
The best implementation of the modified bin method that I know of was TrakLoad, also 
mid-1980's vintage, developed by Robert Sonderegger,  now at Itron, though I doubt that 
Robert is still marketing or supporting the program.

This is all ancient history, as far as energy calculations goes.  I see no advantage to 
the bin method as compared to a hour-by-hour simulation, especially if you have to go 
through a lot of hoops to resurrect the programs as well as get the weather data into the 
bin format (though that's really very easy to do).

All:

For what it is worth, I've found the bin based (beta) online energy savings calculator tool used to support DOE Advanced Rooftop Campaign to be very useful - see: http://www.pnnl.gov/uac/

It's very well documented, and uses an innovative hybrid approach combining regressions of the DOE Commercial Reference Buildings along with bin-based calculation methods for determining cooling energy savings associated with (compressor based cooling - no support for evaporative cooling) rooftop unit related improvements.  The tool accounts for part load efficiencies and basic economizer operations. The tool allows for users to create custom load lines representing building cooling loads, and offers a spreadsheet import for using RTU specific performance data, if needed.  One can even use it to extract  bin hours (DB + MCWB) for canned schedule sets for a large set of US weather sites. With a bit of post processing, given the output bin data one can easily also estimate the energy savings associated with ventilation energy recovery as a possible RTU replacement option.   A useful deployment of taxpayer funded commercial buildings research, IMHO.
Also - I have the executables for ASEAM, if anyone wants them. My recollection is that ASEAM won't run on a 64 bit machine - period. and needs to run in 16 bit mode on a 32 bit windows machine operating in Windows 95 compatibility mode. Nevertheless, it is still a pretty interesting ASCII text GUI (multi-zone) bin based estimating tool.   Contact me offline if you want me to send it to you. The documentation behind ASEAM is largely available (free pdf download to ASHRAE members) as the final report for ASHRAE RP 363 : "Upgrading Documentation of the Proposed TC 4.7 Simplified Energy Analysis Procedure". While I agree with Joe - it's certainly old-school, the documentation is still solid if one is looking to build their own measure specific custom spreadsheet-based calculator, etc.

All the Best,

_Chris

Dear All,
               in my baseline model the chiller is centrifugal type . Now
as per ashrae protocol we have to consider VFD in secondary pumps as well
as AHU for system 8 . but if my chiller is centrifugal whether i have to
consider VFD in chiller also for baseline model?

Thanks everyone for your feedback, it?s much appreciated.



FYI, the context is that we are looking into different options for
predicting energy savings for a custom measure incentive program in New
York (incentives are based on projected savings). We want to implement a
standard approach for popular measures, so that consultants do not need to
perform hourly modeling or spreadsheet calculations themselves (accuracy
varies greatly, and reviewing these analyses requires big resources). We
are looking into both off-the-shelf tools as well as developing our own.

All:



For what it is worth, I?ve found the bin based (beta) online energy savings
calculator tool used to support DOE Advanced Rooftop Campaign to be very
useful - see: http://www.pnnl.gov/uac/



It?s very well documented, and uses an innovative hybrid approach combining
regressions of the DOE Commercial Reference Buildings along with bin-based
calculation methods for determining cooling energy savings associated with
(compressor based cooling ? no support for evaporative cooling) rooftop
unit related improvements.  The tool accounts for part load efficiencies
and basic economizer operations. The tool allows for users to create custom
load lines representing building cooling loads, and offers a spreadsheet
import for using RTU specific performance data, if needed.  One can even
use it to extract  bin hours (DB + MCWB) for canned schedule sets for a
large set of US weather sites. With a bit of post processing, given the
output bin data one can easily also estimate the energy savings associated
with ventilation energy recovery as a possible RTU replacement option.   A
useful deployment of taxpayer funded commercial buildings research, IMHO.

I also recall ASEAM from back in the mid-1980's, when it was thought to be
an easier program to teach than DOE-2 for
a USAID project to help ASEAN countries develop building energy standards.
Back in those days, ASHRAE TC 4.7 was quite
involved in refining the modified  bin calculation method that got known as
the TC 4.7 Simplified Energy Analysis Procedure.
The best implementation of the modified bin method that I know of was
TrakLoad, also mid-1980's vintage, developed by Robert Sonderegger,  now at
Itron, though I doubt that Robert is still marketing or supporting the
program.

This is all ancient history, as far as energy calculations goes.  I see no
advantage to the bin method as compared to a hour-by-hour simulation,
especially if you have to go through a lot of hoops to resurrect the
programs as well as get the weather data into the bin format (though that's
really very easy to do).

I have a program called TMY2BIN which converts freely available TMY2 hourly
weather files into bin weather files for use in simplified energy
calculations.  It does allow you to define occupancy hours.  Cost is $25
Check it out at: http://www.hvacware.net

I do not have any calculations for common ECM's that use this bin weather
data.  That's why you get the big bucks.

It has been several years since buildings had to submit computer energy
analysis of design construction documents showing that the building complies
with local, city, state & federal building energy codes.  The same is true
for LEED certification.  This information can analyzed statistically to
predict building performance.

Thanks everyone for your feedback, it's much appreciated.

 

FYI, the context is that we are looking into different options for
predicting energy savings for a custom measure incentive program in New York
(incentives are based on projected savings). We want to implement a standard
approach for popular measures, so that consultants do not need to perform
hourly modeling or spreadsheet calculations themselves (accuracy varies
greatly, and reviewing these analyses requires big resources). We are
looking into both off-the-shelf tools as well as developing our own.

All:

 

For what it is worth, I've found the bin based (beta) online energy savings
calculator tool used to support DOE Advanced Rooftop Campaign to be very
useful - see: http://www.pnnl.gov/uac/

 

It's very well documented, and uses an innovative hybrid approach combining
regressions of the DOE Commercial Reference Buildings along with bin-based
calculation methods for determining cooling energy savings associated with
(compressor based cooling - no support for evaporative cooling) rooftop unit
related improvements.  The tool accounts for part load efficiencies and
basic economizer operations. The tool allows for users to create custom load
lines representing building cooling loads, and offers a spreadsheet import
for using RTU specific performance data, if needed.  One can even use it to
extract  bin hours (DB + MCWB) for canned schedule sets for a large set of
US weather sites. With a bit of post processing, given the output bin data
one can easily also estimate the energy savings associated with ventilation
energy recovery as a possible RTU replacement option.   A useful deployment
of taxpayer funded commercial buildings research, IMHO. 


Also - I have the executables for ASEAM, if anyone wants them. My
recollection is that ASEAM won't run on a 64 bit machine - period. and needs
to run in 16 bit mode on a 32 bit windows machine operating in Windows 95

Dear simulators,

 

The time is here again to submit articles and announcements for the upcoming
issue of IBPSA News (October 2013).  As usual, it would be good to receive
an announcement from each IBPSA Affiliate as to activities that have taken
place in their region, including conferences and meetings. Items related to
software news are also encouraged: new releases, updates, new versions,
training seminars, notable projects, etc. - all gratefully received. 

 

Please send the article(s) to me at your earliest convenience so they arrive
before 15th September 2013, if possible.

 

Many thanks for your assistance and contributions.

 

I look forward to seeing you in Chambery!

 

Best regards,

I agree Robert!

The push to clarify the boundaries between LEED, the 90.1 mandatory requirements, and demonstrating compliance with 90.1 as a standard was driven by other language.  The foundation of your query is sound:  these vestibule requirements are indeed part of the mandatory requirements LEED mandates through EAp2.

Perhaps by lucky circumstance (?),  I often find myself advising my architects and envelope designers what 90.1/IECC truly require for a given project & jurisdiction, and more often than not I tend to find one or more building entries fall into those 90.1 exceptions.  There are certainly circumstances and projects that will require a vestibule at each entry, and I don?t mean to say that isn?t a possibility.  I merely hope to encourage those approaching this to thoroughly review those passages, so that nobody misses an applicable exception.

Regards,

~Nick

In my original post I said "Since LEED requires compliance with ASHRAE 90.1 Mandatory measures...".  I believe this is correct, at least as far as Architectural, Mechanical and Electrical mandatory requirements are concerned.

And yes, I realize that there are exceptions for doors not used as entries (emergency only or exit only?) and for doors leading into spaces less than 3000 sq. ft.  Also for buildings less than four stories under 10,000 sq. ft. in CZ 3 or 4.  And for mild climates.  I do not believe any of these would apply to the building I am working on, but I do appreciate the options.  Including revolving doors!

I concur with the advice to read the requirements more carefully ? in almost no case is a vestibule required at every door, when they are required.

Take care and recognize that an Appendix G model is NOT a method to show code compliance.  It?s a procedure for benchmarking the building performance for design which exceeds the minimum requirements of the standard.  The first sections of Appendix G provide a concise overview.

You can evaluate the effect a vestibule or not as already discussed ? in function this should simply reduce scheduled infiltration.  That said, I do not believe any Appendix G model should have the proposed and baseline models differing with respect to having a vestibule.  I think table G3.1 is pretty clear that the baseline model is to match the proposed with respect to space/thermal block configuration and arrangement.

Finally, just to drive an extra wedge into the commentary ? while the specified mandatory sections (#.4?) ARE required of the design for a LEED project, to pass EAp2, in my humble opinion it?s incorrect (or at least a stretch) to say LEED requires demonstrating compliance with 90.1.

In sum, to the extent vestibules are required (review the sections and exceptions carefully), a LEED project must by design include them in the proposed design.  In turn, the proposed model should incorporate the vestibule in the form of a distinct thermal block (zone/space), to match the actual design.  In turn, the same edits should be applied to the baseline model as it?s supposed to match the proposed model in this regard.

If the vestibules will be designed to be conditioned by the same systems handling the surrounding spaces, you might make the case that it?s a reasonable thing to not model them explicitly as a separated space (modeler has the prerogative to identify and assert where such spatial approximations are appropriate), but in preliminary LEED submission I?d advise making that decision and case clear to the reviewer in your documentation so if it isn?t acceptable you have the opportunity to make the corrections per above prior to final submission.

Robert,
Did you notice the 7 exceptions to section 5.4.3.4?  One of them may apply to you?
As far as modeling goes, a vestibule is principally an infiltration control technique, so I suppose that you could argue for reduced infiltration when vestibules are present.  I am unaware of any research or other information about how they may affect infiltration.  Since infiltration is such a guessing game, I never apply any special curves for vestibules.
p.s., the IECC 2012 (Int?l Energy Conservation Code) includes mandatory envelope and infiltration testing and criteria.  This will probably be a game changer for the construction industry in areas that adopt this code and will definitely affect the energy models prepared for those projects.

Any of the mandatory requirements in Standard 90.1 must be included in your building design and cannot be traded off using a performance approach.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Vestibule Modeling



I see that ASHRAE 90.1 requires a vestibule in most cases, but I don't
know if it is modeled or if it is just mandatory.  It would seem to me
that if it was modeled, showing compliance using modeling, without a
vestibule, would be OK (you would make it up somewhere else in the
envelope).  Does anybody know if the vestibule is modeled anywhere, and
how to take it out or put it in?

Since LEED requires compliance with ASHRAE 90.1 Mandatory measures, this
makes a vestibule a mandatory requirement unless I can model it with and
without.  If this is even possible.

Otherwise we must put in a vestibule to comply with LEED.


Is this correct?  Does anybody have other thoughts or ideas?  We have a
very efficient building, modeled without the vestibule in Climate Zone
3B.  I would think that we could take a heating penalty and not install
a vestibule AT EVERY DOOR.


I appreciate your thinking about this.

FYI.

It seems like your simulation is not working. Check to see if you have the system shut-off, or ASSIGNED air flows   = 0. You also may not have linked zones to systems.

Dear Energy Modelers,

I am doing an office building simulation. The proposed building is VAV system with electric heating source. While the baseline is system 6 Packaged VAV with PFP Boxes.
The simulation run for the proposed building came across results with very strange unmet load hours "HOURS ANY ZONE ABOVE COOLING THROTTLING RANGE  =  8760". On other hand the baseline is ok.
I would like to know if there is a way to verify such strange result. Furthermore, the proposed building has Zone Thermostat Throttle Range 5?R, and Indoor Design Temp. 72 F/70 F Cooling/Heating.
I would greatly appreciate your thoughts on this matter.

Dear Ellen,
I'll bet that costs are a moving target as modelers become more experienced, software improves and expectations evolve.
I also think that client expectations for an energy model are often exceptionally vague.  Sometimes, it's just "Get me LEED points" with little or no concern for whether it is a good model and will be useful for, say, M&V efforts.  We always assume that the client will be able to use our models for M&V, but I doubt that's a universal attitude.  So far as we can tell, there are energy models prepared for the US EPACT tax credits which are MUCH less costly than seems possible for a detailed model - how can a client tell what they're getting unless they are very sophisticated?
Please share whatever you learn - I'm fairly sure my company is very competitive for M&V-grade models, but it's hard to know if you're either worse than average or much better!

That "drawings etc are poor or non-existent" situation is pretty darn common!  ..and is a factor to be reckoned with as we go forward (hopefully), with a lot more models of existing buildings.

Mr. Dirkes is correct, however I have found poorly documented tenant 
improvements to be even more typical if you need zone by zone modeling 
for some reason.

It occurs to me that there are several programs right here in California 
where you are located, Philip, that struggle with this routinely.  On 
the residential side, programs such as the CalRatePro supported utility 
programs need to model existing buildings where drawings may be 
difficult or impossible to obtain.  On the non-residential side, utility 
rebate programs here in California are likely to require a model to 
predict savings.  Multi-Family upgrade programs like the California Tax 
Credit Allocation Committee (google TCAC) incentive programs deal with 
this as well.  Although you may be familiar with these programs, and 
these programs may actually be at the root of your question, discussing 
this with local consultants and providers, in confidence, might be a 
good way to get information. Resources might include frequent utility 
rebate partners, CALCERTS, EnergySoft, and consultants such as myself.

I would be willing to discuss this with you if you wish.

Hello,

EnergyPlus does not yet fully include the calculation to comply with ISO
7730 Thermal Comfort model. But I came to know that there are some
post-processing tools which inputs the Environmental as well Personal
parameters of thermal comfort, and directly shows compliance with ISO 7730.
If someone is aware of such tools, it would be great if you can share the
info. Thanks!

Best regards,

An interesting variable for a vestibule is the frequency of use.

How do you model a vestibule for a shopping center with a nearly continuous stream of people entering and exiting compared to a vestibule for an office building where the traffic is very low.

I was designing an HVAC system for a 600 sqft guard office in a cold climate. I couldn't find much information on how to model (or design) the system to account for the extremely frequent opening and closing of the door.

In my original post I said "Since LEED requires compliance with ASHRAE 90.1 Mandatory measures...".  I believe this is correct, at least as far as Architectural, Mechanical and Electrical mandatory requirements are concerned.

And yes, I realize that there are exceptions for doors not used as entries (emergency only or exit only?) and for doors leading into spaces less than 3000 sq. ft.  Also for buildings less than four stories under 10,000 sq. ft. in CZ 3 or 4.  And for mild climates.  I do not believe any of these would apply to the building I am working on, but I do appreciate the options.  Including revolving doors!

	I concur with the advice to read the requirements more carefully ? in almost no case is a vestibule required at every door, when they are required.

	 

	Take care and recognize that an Appendix G model is NOT a method to show code compliance.  It?s a procedure for benchmarking the building performance for design which exceeds the minimum requirements of the standard.  The first sections of Appendix G provide a concise overview.

	 

	You can evaluate the effect a vestibule or not as already discussed ? in function this should simply reduce scheduled infiltration.  That said, I do not believe any Appendix G model should have the proposed and baseline models differing with respect to having a vestibule.  I think table G3.1 is pretty clear that the baseline model is to match the proposed with respect to space/thermal block configuration and arrangement.

	 

	Finally, just to drive an extra wedge into the commentary ? while the specified mandatory sections (#.4?) ARE required of the design for a LEED project, to pass EAp2, in my humble opinion it?s incorrect (or at least a stretch) to say LEED requires demonstrating compliance with 90.1. 

	 

	In sum, to the extent vestibules are required (review the sections and exceptions carefully), a LEED project must by design include them in the proposed design.  In turn, the proposed model should incorporate the vestibule in the form of a distinct thermal block (zone/space), to match the actual design.  In turn, the same edits should be applied to the baseline model as it?s supposed to match the proposed model in this regard.  

	 

	If the vestibules will be designed to be conditioned by the same systems handling the surrounding spaces, you might make the case that it?s a reasonable thing to not model them explicitly as a separated space (modeler has the prerogative to identify and assert where such spatial approximations are appropriate), but in preliminary LEED submission I?d advise making that decision and case clear to the reviewer in your documentation so if it isn?t acceptable you have the opportunity to make the corrections per above prior to final submission.

	Robert,

	Did you notice the 7 exceptions to section 5.4.3.4?  One of them may apply to you?

	As far as modeling goes, a vestibule is principally an infiltration control technique, so I suppose that you could argue for reduced infiltration when vestibules are present.  I am unaware of any research or other information about how they may affect infiltration.  Since infiltration is such a guessing game, I never apply any special curves for vestibules.

	p.s., the IECC 2012 (Int?l Energy Conservation Code) includes mandatory envelope and infiltration testing and criteria.  This will probably be a game changer for the construction industry in areas that adopt this code and will definitely affect the energy models prepared for those projects.

	I see that ASHRAE 90.1 requires a vestibule in most cases, but I don't
	know if it is modeled or if it is just mandatory.  It would seem to me
	that if it was modeled, showing compliance using modeling, without a
	vestibule, would be OK (you would make it up somewhere else in the
	envelope).  Does anybody know if the vestibule is modeled anywhere, and
	how to take it out or put it in?
	
	Since LEED requires compliance with ASHRAE 90.1 Mandatory measures, this
	makes a vestibule a mandatory requirement unless I can model it with and
	without.  If this is even possible.
	
	Otherwise we must put in a vestibule to comply with LEED.
	
	
	Is this correct?  Does anybody have other thoughts or ideas?  We have a
	very efficient building, modeled without the vestibule in Climate Zone
	3B.  I would think that we could take a heating penalty and not install
	a vestibule AT EVERY DOOR.
	
	
	I appreciate your thinking about this.

There have been a few discussion in the past across the [bldg.-sim] and [equest-users] lists covering costs and fee structures for energy modeling services.  Attached are a few selected threads that should be worthwhile reads from the bottom-up.  The "Response & Statement..." thread in particular diverged into many different directions (It was a broad topic of conversation to start, to be fair) - a search of the archives will lead you to a number of other responses if you should find the content matter interesting.

As someone who writes proposals, I REALLY wish there were an easy answer, but alas every project / client is unique!  Coming to a reasonable estimate typically requires digging hard at what information is (or will become) readily available, clear definition & statement of expectations, and an honest introspective assessment of how efficiently the modeling staff can accomplish the known challenges, and much the modelers' time is worth.  These are all tricky propositions in and of themselves.

When limited/no resources are available - you have to consider costs of field-verification and creating what you need for the intended goals.  Pricing the costs of developing "what you know you don't know" is always going to involve some educated guesswork.  Anecdotally, I can recall an SD phase exercise exploring building massing for a large renovation, and we had only fragmented info to work from in the way of plans.  After a trip to the site and a walk of the perimeter & courtyards snapping lots of shots from different perspectives, I constructed a massing model in Sketchup from the photos themselves (this is actually kinda fun - here's a video showing the principles of the procedure<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSuDoX8SPtU>).  This "SD" model was used directly at that stage alonside the free IES-VE Sketchup plugins, and was later used as a basis for developing design plans and a more involved series of eQuest model studies.  Main point being: this procedure is something I had to develop 'on the fly,' and encountering the same challenge in the future I'll have a good idea of what this entails, but often we can only work from the pool of experience we have and throw together a number that seems reasonable on paper.  If you're disciplined about reviewing the estimates and assumptions you make at the close of a project, you'll grow in your ability to assess and accurately quote future work.

Regards,

~Nick

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] published modeling costs

It occurs to me that there are several programs right here in California where you are located, Philip, that struggle with this routinely.  On the residential side, programs such as the CalRatePro supported utility programs need to model existing buildings where drawings may be difficult or impossible to obtain.  On the non-residential side, utility rebate programs here in California are likely to require a model to predict savings.  Multi-Family upgrade programs like the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee (google TCAC) incentive programs deal with this as well.  Although you may be familiar with these programs, and these programs may actually be at the root of your question, discussing this with local consultants and providers, in confidence, might be a good way to get information.  Resources might include frequent utility rebate partners, CALCERTS, EnergySoft, and consultants such as myself.

I would be willing to discuss this with you if you wish.

* * * Call for papers for CIBSE ASHRAE Technical Symposium - Dublin 2014 * * *

**Moving to a New World of Building Systems Performance**

Recognising that system and plant performance is a global issue this joint CIBSE and ASHRAE symposium will give a platform to the latest practice and research from around the world in active and passive building systems that will shape an effective future for the built environment with minimum resource impact.

The fourth annual Technical Symposium will take place on 3rd-4th April 2014 in Dublin and aims to encourage the participation of young and experienced researchers and industry practitioners to share experiences and develop networks.

This invitation is for papers concerning research and development that may address ...
*    Enhanced building engineering solutions through modeling and prediction
*    Innovation in passive and active building systems
*    Design and operation of future cities
*    Improving the operation of the built environment
*    Maintaining and improving legacy building systems
*    The development and impact of benchmarks, standards and regulatory measures
*    Communication, skills and workforce development

This list is not exhaustive but provides the intended context of the Technical Symposium that will focus on aspects that are of interest to CIBSE and ASHRAE members. Material is welcomed based on recent or current research and application as well as the actual or potential impact of that research on the built environment.

For the first time this year there are additionally opportunities for the presentation of relevant case studies supported by keynotes (as opposed to a formal paper).

All papers will be peer reviewed and published electronically through CIBSE. Selected papers may be developed for publication in BSERT.

*Abstracts*
Please send by email to groups at cibse.org<mailto:groups at cibse.org> no later than 15th September 2013
*    the intended title of the submission
*    authors'/author's names/name and affiliation
*    specific email address of principal author
*    abstract of maximum 250 words in English, the official symposium language
*    note whether it is a proposed paper (to be orally or poster presented) OR a case study

*Timetable*
- Early October 2013 - Authors selected to proceed will be advised and specifically invited to prepare draft material suitable for oral or for poster delivery.
- 15th November 2013 - Selected authors submit draft manuscripts of full paper (between 3000 and 5000 words), or the draft poster, or case study keynotes for peer review
- Mid December 2013 - Authors receive reviewers' comments and develop final submission following review, and subject to acceptance by the reviewers/technical committee.
- 19th January 2014 - Deadline for submission of the final paper/poster, or case study keynotes

The Symposium Technical Committee will allocate submissions to oral or poster sessions and at any stage reserves the right to reject any submission

Sukreet,

Ditto on your presentation comparing E+ and Equest.

My thought was that many federal buildings are pretty typical office
buildings so you could use the results for office buildings in those
reports as a pretty good proxy.

For GSA buildings (I just remembered), there's the report Assessing Green
Building Performance: A Post Occupancy Evaluation of 12 GSA
Buildings<http://www.gsa.gov/graphics/pbs/GSA_AssessGreen_white_paper.pdf>.
The link is to the white paper, while there's a more thorough full report
here. <http://www.gsa.gov/graphics/pbs/GSA_Assessing_Green_Full_Report.pdf>

Message-ID: <CA+7A=v4qh_-pT8Yv6+HBQpAUMe20jWPEn0R3ZK_hJ+ab639ZLQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I am doing an energy simulation model in eQuest. I noticed that the
load through roof conduction in LS-C is zero where as in LS-B (for
plenum space) it is showing some load.

As per my understanding this load should appear in LS-C also.

Also, if I reduce the U value of the roof, the load through roof
reduces and can be accounted in LS-B only (plenum space).

Refer attached LS-C and LS-B reports.

Any help will be appreciated.


Thanks & Regards

Hi,

This happens because the load calculation is made with a fixed temperature
(see picture). All the spaces, include plenum zones, have the same
temperature by default (70?F). So, all roof load appears in the plenum
spaces. To considerate the roof load, you have to change this temperature in
plenum spaces and a part of roof load will appear like "internal surface
conduction". But I'm not sure if this is a good practice. Maybe someone else
has an opinion about that.

Message-ID: <CAJaiD7o7=KZ9TQxwOK9ceTenhchRSE2OwDJ2Tqnq2U9jY6qBjw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

On a large warehouse (shipping & distribution center) project, we're told
by our consultant that the 650,000 square feet warehouse component is being
designed to be ventilated (OA) at 0.06 cfm/sf. There are small portions
with multiple levels, total ventilation CFM ends up being close to 60,000.
(we're told by our consultant that this is the code minimum). CO2 sensors
are being planned to bring the OA levels down, not yet sure what the
thresholds are.

The office component that is a tenth in square footage but roughly equal
occupancy as the warehouse, results in around 15,000 CFM ventilation.

While we generally trust our consultant's professional judgement, the
design team is concerned that the warehouse ventilation might be over
designed. Is anyone aware of workarounds that meet code but effectively
optimize the ventilation/OA rates in such large warehouse settings?

Thank you,
Ramana Koti.

Take a look at ASHRAE 62.2, it establishes minimum ventilation rates for
various occupancies.

Ramana, code minimum is code minimum, no working around that.

0.06 cfm/ft2 is the right value for warehouse. And it is not CO2 dependant,  such sensors do bot apply in those case. Why ventilation is required is to vent out pollutants emitted by the stored goods.

Office space May benefit from sensors, but that is not recommended for spaces with population density < 25 #/1000ft2.

At first reading, your consultants are reading correctly ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or later). Keep trusting them.

Hi All,

I'm modeling a Building that has a Dedicated Outdoor Air system, this
outdoor air
is distributed for a central air system w/ VAV in each floor and then the
mixed and conditioned
air is distribuited by a single duct for each zone. The DOAS has a specific
chiller for it with a lower temperature for the chilled water, comparing to
the chillers that supplies other systems.
In the energyplus's templates doesn't has this kind of system, because you
can't have a DOAS with VAV (in this templates).

Does anyone knows how to model this system?


Thanks,

Cicero.

Dear all,

If you've heard too much about optimisation but never seen one in action, it is probably time to try your hands on jEPlus+EA. The brand new v1.4 is much more grown-up compared to the previous version. For one thing, it has now a proper GUI that allows you do more or less everything in one place... Here are some key features:
  * A full-fledged optimisation tool for EnergyPlus users
  * Out-of-the-box support for jEPlus projects, with user-defined objective functions
  * Highly efficient multi-objective (up to 10!) optimisation method based on a customized NSGA-II
  * Built-in remote simulation function through the JESS Client
  * A scatter plot for inspecting individual solutions
  * Frequency histograms for visualizing distribution of variables within the discovered solutions
  * A table view for easy sorting and exporting (through copy-and-paste) of results
  * Automatically saves solution data to avoid loss of work during a long run
  * And, of course, full-featured command-line interface for automated optimisation tasks
Screenshots illustrating the key features can be found here: http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jeplus/wiki/doku.php?id=docs:jeplus_ea:features_1_4. We are still working on the user's manual. However, the software is available, now. Please register on the website to download it. ...and, yes, it is "free".

These do not appear to have been preapproved for any particular certification requirements. However, the webinar slides and audio recordings are freely available and the topics are all energy-related.

You can also submit new questions to the exam for a portion of the credit.

The USGBC has an extensive library of educational content, some of which are free. (Not everything from USGBC would apply to BEMP of course, but some might.)

Local ASHRAE, USGBC, or IBPSA-USA chapters might have live events for a nominal cost.

IBPSA-USA chapters also host online events, these should qualify.

If you are a PE or LEED AP with specialty the CEU credits you earn to support those will sometimes overlap with BEMP topics.

Hello,

I would like to start a discussion about where to earn free Continuing Education credits for BEMP certification. Trane offers free online continuing education courses (http://www.trane.com/COMMERCIAL/Cont...Education.aspx<http://www.trane.com/COMMERCIAL/ContinuingEducation/ContinuingEducation.aspx>). ASHRAE also offers seminars but they are not free. Please share information on other free continuing education seminars.

We are looking for a (text)book about design of sustainable energy systems for the built environment. It should be for master level engineering students with mixed background (mechanical, electrical, architectural engineering mainly). Any tips or pointers would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

Hi All,

The LS-C report comes from the LOADS simulation portion of DOE 2.2. The
plenum reference temperature used in LOADS is adjusted in the SYSTEMS
portion of the program and the loads in the spaces adjacent to the plenum
are corrected
correspondingly.

it in a LEED certified refrigerated warehouse, it 
did reduce by a large amount the outside air.

A work of caution


Technically LEED projects are required to use the VRP method (not the IAQ
method) to determine the minimum required ventilation airflows for projects.

Dear All,
 
On a large warehouse (shipping & distribution center) project, we're told by
our consultant that the 650,000 square feet warehouse component is being
designed to be ventilated (OA) at 0.06 cfm/sf. There are small portions with
multiple levels, total ventilation CFM ends up being close to 60,000. (we're
told by our consultant that this is the code minimum). CO2 sensors are being
planned to bring the OA levels down, not yet sure what the thresholds are.
 
The office component that is a tenth in square footage but roughly equal
occupancy as the warehouse, results in around 15,000 CFM ventilation. 
 
While we generally trust our consultant's professional judgement, the design
team is concerned that the warehouse ventilation might be over designed. Is
anyone aware of workarounds that meet code but effectively optimize the
ventilation/OA rates in such large warehouse settings?
 
Thank you,

Just to repeat what David and Rodrigo have already sad, DOE-2 calculates conduction loads 
in a two step process. In LOADS, a constant reference temperature is specified, which 
DOE-2 uses to calculate the amount of heat flow through the surfaces. This is the LOADS 
loads summarized in the LS-E and LS-F reports.  In SYSTEMS, DOE-2 calculates the true 
temperature of the zone based on the loads passed from LOADS, as well as the actions of 
the HVAC system.  In the course of this calculation, the heat flows ("loads") from LOADS 
are adjusted, but this is not done surface by surface, but in total using the so-called 
"Zone Conductance" times the difference between the actual zone temperature and the 
reference temperature used in LOADS.  At this point, heat flows through internal walls are 
also considered, using the  difference between this hour's zone temperature and the 
previous hour's zone temperature of the adjacent space, e.g., the Attic or Plenum.  If you 
are interested in this number, I believe it can be extracted in an hourly report.

In reference to Rodrigo's question, I don't see any benefit in forcing a heat flow between 
the room and the attic by using different reference temperatures.   You will simply get a 
constant heat flow at that temperature difference throughout the simulation. In reality, 
attics are generally colder than the room in the winter and warmer than the room in the 
summer, so the derived heat flow with this temperature difference doesn't get you any 
closer to reality, in my opinion.

Joe, Just wondering,  given your expertise how would you compare this to
the heat balance method.., and what do you think is more realistic?

In reference to Rodrigo's question, I don't see any benefit in forcing a heat flow between the room and the attic by using different reference temperatures.   You will simply get a constant heat flow at that temperature difference throughout the simulation. In reality, attics are generally colder than the room in the winter and warmer than the room in the summer, so the derived heat flow with this temperature difference doesn't get you any closer to reality, in my opinion.

Objet : [Equest-users] Roof Conduction Load



Hi All,



I am doing an energy simulation model in eQuest. I noticed that the load through roof conduction in LS-C is zero where as in LS-B (for plenum space) it is showing some load.



As per my understanding this load should appear in LS-C also.

Also, if I reduce the U value of the roof, the load through roof reduces and can be accounted in LS-B only (plenum space).



Refer attached LS-C and LS-B reports.

Any help will be appreciated.





Thanks & Regards



Bhartendu Awasthi

Jeremiah,

Your  question is not quite on the mark because what I've described is downstream from the 
calculation of room loads where techniques such as the Weighting Factor or the Heat 
Balance methods come into play.   Before I get to that issue, though, I want to point out 
that the "Adjust Loads" procedure I described is done automatically by DOE-2 and totally 
invisible to the User;  I did so only to explain whyBhartendu (the original poster) was 
not seeing any conduction loads through the ceiling.

Now, back to this "Adjust Loads" procedure, there is no simulation program I know of that 
solves simultaneously for the heat flows and the zone temperature.  DOE-2 does it in the 
two-step way that others and I have just described. When you said "compared to the Heat 
Balance Method", I assume you're thinking of EnergyPlus.  So, how does EnergyPlus meet 
this problem?  Whereas DOE-2 does one year of LOADS and then one year of SYSTEMS, 
EnergyPlus does them in the same time step, but also sequentially. Therefore,  EnergyPlus 
calculates the heat flows using the zone temperature from the previous time step which are 
then used in its HVAC simulation without adjustment. This should be okay when zone 
temperatures don't change, but what about at morning start-up when temperatures could 
change by 5-10 F within one hour?  I've always wondered whether that's why EnergyPlus 
gives much lower heating loads in mild California climates than does DOE-2?  As far as 
which procedure is "more realistic", I can't say.

HI,

I faced a similar situation When I was modeling perimeter versus interior
systems for an office floor plate, I saw that each zone and its loads are
isolated in the calculations and eQUEST does not factor any sort of heat
transfer between zones (adiabatic) in eQUEST. So for example if there is
curtain wall facade, the solar loads only applied to that exterior zone and
did not transfer into the interior zones. We therefore encountered issues
with oversizing for the non-exterior zones of the office space when
modeling as designed.

As I understand this appears to be case with roof loads being transferred
to plenums only and not the occupied space below as well.

I dont remember exactly how we resolved this and infact I think we took
that oversizing penalty in our model. But one of the suggestions we were
toying with was that we make an opening or model the internal wall as an
air film.

OK folks, the Radiance Workshop recordings are now available on NREL's OpenStudio YouTube channel!

We split the morning and afternoon programs from each day into their own streams, plus there is one for the NREL campus panel discussion from Tuesday afternoon. The entire 18 hours(!) of content can be accessed in order from the following playlist link:

http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPk2tlcZM0gydvEW0VFgZLZ3S8eSbi-cx

Unfortunately the recording timed out early on some days, so Kera Lagios' DIVA for Rhino demo is unceremoniously halted about halfway through, and the OpenStudio demo does not appear at all. Jack DeValpine makes a fast exit at the end of day two as well. Apologies all around on that score. With compressed video and small type being what they are, you also might want to avail yourself of the high resolution copies of all the presenter slide decks Andy McNeil and LBNL have made available at radiance-online.org:

http://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2013-golden-co

We left the dead time during the coffee breaks in the streams, so you can pretend you were actually there. Just play back, and during the breaks make small talk about the 5-phase method with your cat. 

One last time, I want to say it was a pleasure and an honor to be able to host the workshop this year. Enjoy!

I believe ASHRAE text books have a DHW/person table for various building types. I know they have hotels, dormitories, and apartments. Need to check on a restaurant setting.

Is it an existing building? If so, another way to approach it would be to get an idea of the baseline(non-heating) natural gas usage from the utility data(pick a late spring or early fall month when school is in session), which would be made up of domestic hot water + cooking. Dhw is easier to estimate per person, and subtracting that, you could get an idea of the cooking use(I know you're not using eQuest, but you could start w an eQuest default for per person hot water use in a school) . Both cooking + dhw are probably fairly small.

Hello Mr. Passerini,

Not done it yet in a project but seems like process load to me - one that would remain same in both the proposed and baseline.

That said, one could check with the school canteen staff what the rate of consumption is (per child) if the existing school facility does it's cooking on same fuel?!

Or else, if it helps as a wild indicator - here in India, my family of 2 adults and 2 kids (age 6 and 2) consumes roughly 30 kg of LPG (liquified petroleum gas) for 2 months. We cook 1 to 2 times in a day using LPG with bit of reheating /cooking done using the microwave and toaster/ mixer used mostly in the mornings. You will need to look up the calorific value of LPG versus natural gas and run some back-of-the-envelope calculations to extrapolate day-time US school cooking requirements from an Indian household consumption for 3ish-member family for their daily meals over 2 months.

It will be good for you to have a few other reference points. And it'll be good to know what and how you crack it....

best,
Neeraj

Is it an existing building? If so, another way to approach it would be to get an idea of the baseline(non-heating) natural gas usage from the utility data(pick a late spring or early fall month when school is in session), which would be made up of domestic hot water + cooking. Dhw is easier to estimate per person, and subtracting that, you could get an idea of the cooking use(I know you're not using eQuest, but you could start w an eQuest default for per person hot water use in a school) . Both cooking + dhw are probably fairly small.

Hi;

I would suggest  AO Smith water heater and boiler  manufacturer sizing 
software available on line at

http://www.hotwatersizing.com/Application.aspx


I have designed and installed several projects including an office 
building cafeteria with gas fired
water heaters combined with a 750 gallon per day Solar thermal array. 
using AO Smith.  Good Stuff.

The spreadsheet here has lots of collected data on typical/baseline kitchen equipment.  More on their website to read up on to see where they're coming from.

	Tools' White Paper
Message-ID: <CA+bpH8-BrRfpkQiwVbARp2sfX0ZG6UAxJq0cKnvJkCeaDjgrNg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Building Simulation Community,

We are beginning to update and expand the 'Contrasting Capabilities of
Building Energy Performance Simulation
Programs'<http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/tools_directory/pdfs/contrasting_the_capabilities_of_building_energy_performance_simulation_programs_v1.0.pdf>to:

- include more detail on simulation engines and their underlying solution
methods

- explictly separate interface capabilities from calculations

- expand to new simulation domains and scopes of tools
The focus will be on providing as much comparable information about various
simulation engines, interfaces, and methods as possible. We expect
significantly expanded, in-depth description of the various tools.

Why are we updating it?  It's been almost a decade and the journal verison
of this (Building and Environment Vol 43 Issue 4, pgs 661-673) has been
cited more than 450 times.

If you are a software developer and at the Building Simulation 2013
conference in Chambery this week, please find Jon Hand or Dru Crawley for
further information.  If you are a user interested in providing reality
checks for developer-provided information, we'd also like to hear from
you.  If you are not at the Building Simulation Conference, please contact
Jon or Dru by email.
What will the final product be?  We plan an interactive web site, a PDF
white paper, and journal articles.  The web version will be interactive
with links to web sites of the specific tools, links to published papers,
and more in-depth discussion than possible in a white paper. By posting on
a web site, it can be a living document which can be updated over time.

Hi,



Does anyone know of any current tools that use the BIN method? I am
imagining something that both processes weather data into BINs (taking into
account occupied versus unoccupied times), and maybe includes some
templates for common energy efficiency measures?



Thanks,

Mike

You could try Binmaker Pro from InterEnergy.
No templates but I believe you can define hours.

Back in the day, I used a BASIC program called ASEAM that was developed by an ASHRAE research project.  It was capable of modeling only a single zone and limited number of HVAC systems (as I recall). I think I found a version of it online a few years ago and then decided I'd probably not use it, and no longer have it.  You may be able to find it....  ASEAM (A Simplified Energy Analysis Method) uses a modified bin method approach for energy calcs.

I have a program called TMY2BIN which converts freely available TMY2 hourly weather files into bin weather files for use in simplified energy calculations.  It does allow you to define occupancy hours.  Cost is $25  Check it out at: http://www.hvacware.net

I do not have any calculations for common ECM's that use this bin weather data.  That's why you get the big bucks.

I also recall ASEAM from back in the mid-1980's, when it was thought to be an easier 
program to teach than DOE-2 for
a USAID project to help ASEAN countries develop building energy standards.  Back in those 
days, ASHRAE TC 4.7 was quite
involved in refining the modified  bin calculation method that got known as the TC 4.7 
Simplified Energy Analysis Procedure.
The best implementation of the modified bin method that I know of was TrakLoad, also 
mid-1980's vintage, developed by Robert Sonderegger,  now at Itron, though I doubt that 
Robert is still marketing or supporting the program.

This is all ancient history, as far as energy calculations goes.  I see no advantage to 
the bin method as compared to a hour-by-hour simulation, especially if you have to go 
through a lot of hoops to resurrect the programs as well as get the weather data into the 
bin format (though that's really very easy to do).

All:

For what it is worth, I've found the bin based (beta) online energy savings calculator tool used to support DOE Advanced Rooftop Campaign to be very useful - see: http://www.pnnl.gov/uac/

It's very well documented, and uses an innovative hybrid approach combining regressions of the DOE Commercial Reference Buildings along with bin-based calculation methods for determining cooling energy savings associated with (compressor based cooling - no support for evaporative cooling) rooftop unit related improvements.  The tool accounts for part load efficiencies and basic economizer operations. The tool allows for users to create custom load lines representing building cooling loads, and offers a spreadsheet import for using RTU specific performance data, if needed.  One can even use it to extract  bin hours (DB + MCWB) for canned schedule sets for a large set of US weather sites. With a bit of post processing, given the output bin data one can easily also estimate the energy savings associated with ventilation energy recovery as a possible RTU replacement option.   A useful deployment of taxpayer funded commercial buildings research, IMHO.
Also - I have the executables for ASEAM, if anyone wants them. My recollection is that ASEAM won't run on a 64 bit machine - period. and needs to run in 16 bit mode on a 32 bit windows machine operating in Windows 95 compatibility mode. Nevertheless, it is still a pretty interesting ASCII text GUI (multi-zone) bin based estimating tool.   Contact me offline if you want me to send it to you. The documentation behind ASEAM is largely available (free pdf download to ASHRAE members) as the final report for ASHRAE RP 363 : "Upgrading Documentation of the Proposed TC 4.7 Simplified Energy Analysis Procedure". While I agree with Joe - it's certainly old-school, the documentation is still solid if one is looking to build their own measure specific custom spreadsheet-based calculator, etc.

All the Best,

I have a program called TMY2BIN which converts freely available TMY2 hourly weather files into bin weather files for use in simplified energy calculations.  It does allow you to define occupancy hours.  Cost is $25  Check it out at: http://www.hvacware.net

I do not have any calculations for common ECM's that use this bin weather data.  That's why you get the big bucks.

ASEAM is available through Archive.org's wayback machine at:

I think it was DOS software.

Dear All,
               in my baseline model the chiller is centrifugal type . Now
as per ashrae protocol we have to consider VFD in secondary pumps as well
as AHU for system 8 . but if my chiller is centrifugal whether i have to
consider VFD in chiller also for baseline model?

Thanks everyone for your feedback, it?s much appreciated.



FYI, the context is that we are looking into different options for
predicting energy savings for a custom measure incentive program in New
York (incentives are based on projected savings). We want to implement a
standard approach for popular measures, so that consultants do not need to
perform hourly modeling or spreadsheet calculations themselves (accuracy
varies greatly, and reviewing these analyses requires big resources). We
are looking into both off-the-shelf tools as well as developing our own.

All:



For what it is worth, I?ve found the bin based (beta) online energy savings
calculator tool used to support DOE Advanced Rooftop Campaign to be very
useful - see: http://www.pnnl.gov/uac/



It?s very well documented, and uses an innovative hybrid approach combining
regressions of the DOE Commercial Reference Buildings along with bin-based
calculation methods for determining cooling energy savings associated with
(compressor based cooling ? no support for evaporative cooling) rooftop
unit related improvements.  The tool accounts for part load efficiencies
and basic economizer operations. The tool allows for users to create custom
load lines representing building cooling loads, and offers a spreadsheet
import for using RTU specific performance data, if needed.  One can even
use it to extract  bin hours (DB + MCWB) for canned schedule sets for a
large set of US weather sites. With a bit of post processing, given the
output bin data one can easily also estimate the energy savings associated
with ventilation energy recovery as a possible RTU replacement option.   A
useful deployment of taxpayer funded commercial buildings research, IMHO.
Also ? I have the executables for ASEAM, if anyone wants them. My
recollection is that ASEAM won?t run on a 64 bit machine ? period. and
needs to run in 16 bit mode on a 32 bit windows machine operating in
Windows 95 compatibility mode. Nevertheless, it is still a pretty
interesting ASCII text GUI (multi-zone) bin based estimating tool.
  Contact me offline if you want me to send it to you. The documentation
behind ASEAM is largely available (free pdf download to ASHRAE members) as
the final report for ASHRAE RP 363 : ?Upgrading Documentation of the
Proposed TC 4.7 Simplified Energy Analysis Procedure?. While I agree with
Joe ? it?s certainly old-school, the documentation is still solid if one is
looking to build their own measure specific custom spreadsheet-based
calculator, etc.



All the Best,

I also recall ASEAM from back in the mid-1980's, when it was thought to be
an easier program to teach than DOE-2 for
a USAID project to help ASEAN countries develop building energy standards.
Back in those days, ASHRAE TC 4.7 was quite
involved in refining the modified  bin calculation method that got known as
the TC 4.7 Simplified Energy Analysis Procedure.
The best implementation of the modified bin method that I know of was
TrakLoad, also mid-1980's vintage, developed by Robert Sonderegger,  now at
Itron, though I doubt that Robert is still marketing or supporting the
program.

This is all ancient history, as far as energy calculations goes.  I see no
advantage to the bin method as compared to a hour-by-hour simulation,
especially if you have to go through a lot of hoops to resurrect the
programs as well as get the weather data into the bin format (though that's
really very easy to do).

I have a program called TMY2BIN which converts freely available TMY2 hourly
weather files into bin weather files for use in simplified energy
calculations.  It does allow you to define occupancy hours.  Cost is $25
Check it out at: http://www.hvacware.net

I do not have any calculations for common ECM's that use this bin weather
data.  That's why you get the big bucks.

It has been several years since buildings had to submit computer energy
analysis of design construction documents showing that the building complies
with local, city, state & federal building energy codes.  The same is true
for LEED certification.  This information can analyzed statistically to
predict building performance.

Thanks everyone for your feedback, it's much appreciated.

 

FYI, the context is that we are looking into different options for
predicting energy savings for a custom measure incentive program in New York
(incentives are based on projected savings). We want to implement a standard
approach for popular measures, so that consultants do not need to perform
hourly modeling or spreadsheet calculations themselves (accuracy varies
greatly, and reviewing these analyses requires big resources). We are
looking into both off-the-shelf tools as well as developing our own.

All:

 

For what it is worth, I've found the bin based (beta) online energy savings
calculator tool used to support DOE Advanced Rooftop Campaign to be very
useful - see: http://www.pnnl.gov/uac/

 

It's very well documented, and uses an innovative hybrid approach combining
regressions of the DOE Commercial Reference Buildings along with bin-based
calculation methods for determining cooling energy savings associated with
(compressor based cooling - no support for evaporative cooling) rooftop unit
related improvements.  The tool accounts for part load efficiencies and
basic economizer operations. The tool allows for users to create custom load
lines representing building cooling loads, and offers a spreadsheet import
for using RTU specific performance data, if needed.  One can even use it to
extract  bin hours (DB + MCWB) for canned schedule sets for a large set of
US weather sites. With a bit of post processing, given the output bin data
one can easily also estimate the energy savings associated with ventilation
energy recovery as a possible RTU replacement option.   A useful deployment
of taxpayer funded commercial buildings research, IMHO. 


Also - I have the executables for ASEAM, if anyone wants them. My
recollection is that ASEAM won't run on a 64 bit machine - period. and needs
to run in 16 bit mode on a 32 bit windows machine operating in Windows 95
compatibility mode. Nevertheless, it is still a pretty interesting ASCII
text GUI (multi-zone) bin based estimating tool.   Contact me offline if you
want me to send it to you. The documentation behind ASEAM is largely
available (free pdf download to ASHRAE members) as the final report for
ASHRAE RP 363 : "Upgrading Documentation of the Proposed TC 4.7 Simplified
Energy Analysis Procedure". While I agree with Joe - it's certainly
old-school, the documentation is still solid if one is looking to build
their own measure specific custom spreadsheet-based calculator, etc.  


 

All the Best,

I also recall ASEAM from back in the mid-1980's, when it was thought to be
an easier program to teach than DOE-2 for 
a USAID project to help ASEAN countries develop building energy standards.
Back in those days, ASHRAE TC 4.7 was quite
involved in refining the modified  bin calculation method that got known as
the TC 4.7 Simplified Energy Analysis Procedure. 
The best implementation of the modified bin method that I know of was
TrakLoad, also mid-1980's vintage, developed by Robert Sonderegger,  now at
Itron, though I doubt that Robert is still marketing or supporting the
program.

This is all ancient history, as far as energy calculations goes.  I see no
advantage to the bin method as compared to a hour-by-hour simulation,
especially if you have to go through a lot of hoops to resurrect the
programs as well as get the weather data into the bin format (though that's
really very easy to do).

Back in the day, I used a BASIC program called ASEAM that was developed by
an ASHRAE research project.  It was capable of modeling only a single zone
and limited number of HVAC systems (as I recall). I think I found a version
of it online a few years ago and then decided I'd probably not use it, and
no longer have it.  You may be able to find it..  ASEAM (A Simplified Energy
Analysis Method) uses a modified bin method approach for energy calcs.

I have a program called TMY2BIN which converts freely available TMY2 hourly
weather files into bin weather files for use in simplified energy
calculations.  It does allow you to define occupancy hours.  Cost is $25
Check it out at: http://www.hvacware.net

I do not have any calculations for common ECM's that use this bin weather
data.  That's why you get the big bucks.

Hi, 

  

Does anyone know of any current tools that use the BIN method? I am
imagining something that both processes weather data into BINs (taking into
account occupied versus unoccupied times), and maybe includes some templates
for common energy efficiency measures? 

  

Thanks, 

Mike
