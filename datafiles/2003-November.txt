Chris,
I've had the same frustration over the years.  John's suggestion is the best in my experience.

Using the SZRH system (one system per zone) will be a good approximation if your zones (FCUs) have similar mixed air temperature demands.  If you have a situation with significant load diversity or mismatched cooling capacity and zone load (i.e. some zones calling for cooling earlier than others) then this approximation may be unacceptable to you.

There is one other approach, use the OA-FROM-SYSTEM.  In this case set up a dummy zone with no loads (you need a little load but basically zero) and use a reset schedule to control supply air temperature.  You could leave the heating and cooling coils active if your outdoor air system is tempering.  Use this system to pass the return air temperature (effectively supply air due to zero load).  You can set the outdoor air system volume manually if you do want to see the tempering energy, otherwise temperature only (not mass flow) is being passed to your fan coils.

The problem with this approach is getting a reset schedule which approximates your actual supply air temperature demands.  I have found heatign and cooling energy very sensitive to this schedule as you would expect.  You get into recool and reheat situations easily and at other times miss out on economy cycle cooling.

I understand that a robust implementation of minimum outdoor air systems may potentially be added to the DOE-2.2 engine in the near future.  This would get around this problem along with a number of others.

Regards,
Graham

Hello:

ASHRAE RP-865 has a four-pipe, fan coil simulation on a spreadsheet that you
can easily add an economizer to. Copies of the final report can be obtained

Chris:

Can you use the single zone reheat system (SZRH), which CAN accomodate an
economizer? This could be Done in either 2.1E or 2.2. Just jury rig it so
that the cooling and heating coils don't operate simultaneously.

By the way, this IS a chilled water/hot water system, correct?

Realize these systems are just statistical Btu generators within the
program, so you can call a system something, but yet make it act like
something else.

Priya,
 
Download the DOE2.2(eQuest) documentation from DOE2.com.  There are six volumes (of .pdf) that explain how DOE2.2 works.  This will answer your questions on how to create the components within eQuest to use the data you develop.  As has already been mentioned DOE 2.2 is good at determining loads/energy but not specific conditions within a space. 
 
You may think about doing several models.  Use DOE 2.2 to simulate monthly/annual energy use (calibrate with utility bills) and a more advanced program to look at the thermal mass charachteristics of the strawbale wall and the effects on internal temp.
 
Be careful using HOBO temperature loggers, they are not well suited for measuring small temperature differentials because of their accuracy.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] energy simulation of strawbale houses


Hello,
 
I am graduate student at the Penn State university. My research is on the energy modeling of strawbale houses situated on the Northern Plains of US. Briefly explaining my objectives of research, i would be performing steady state and dynamic tests in labs to determine the R value of the strawbale specimen. This value would be used in energy modeling software to simulate the building performance of an already existing strawbale house. The results of this dynamic simulation would be compared with the temperature data that are being recorded using HOBO of the existing structure also used for simulation. For the purpose of simulation, I am considering eQuest but    DOE 3.0 also seems to be appropriate.
 
My concerns, for which I wish to seek suggestions, are how do I plug in the R value obtained from the lab experiments into eQuest. Is it possible to do so with any softwares efficiently. Also, I am not sure, how would I convert temperature data to be able to compare them with the results of the simulation model. 
 
Any time taken out to put down their thoughts of suggestions would be sincerely appreciated. It has been quite interesting to read the various questions, concerns and comments that come online through this list serve!
 
Thankyou very much.

Gerald,
The IU system will generally simulate active/passive chilled beams.  You
need to think about your configuration.  If your heating is all done
centrally with dehumidiifcation centrally and space cooling at the beams
then you can simulate in EQuest with exception of getting the reheat arising
from dehumidification correct.  In this case you don't specify a zone level
heat-temp-sch as this will enable zone heating coils.  Once DOE-2.2
dehumidifies it will not use the heating reset schedule to reheat centrally,
it will only allow zone reheat.  In mild winter climates this is probably
not too much of an issue, but if you have a heating climate then this
limitation could be a problem.  If you have zone heating through radiators /
baseboards then you should be OK.

Rego,
They came out of the ASHRAE RP-472 work.  You could consult:
1) The final report, available from ASHRAE.
2) Steve Harris' PhD thesis.  (It is available online from UMI

Priya,
You need to determine what you hope to learn from the simulations?  DOE will have limitations over other packages as it is energy focussed and solves the loads portion of the simulation with a steady state internal temperature.  In your case temperatures will likely be floating significantly within the house.  Also if you are at all looking at comfort temperatures as opposed to air temperatures then again you will want to look beyond the various versions of DOE.  TAS, Apache, EnergyPlus, and TRNSYS will all provide a better simulation of floating space temperatures and comfort as well as providing you loads / energy.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] energy simulation of strawbale bulding
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200311281306.AA0654937pd80000496528@gard.com>

Hello,

I am graduate student at the Penn State university. My research is on the energy modeling of strawbale houses situated on the Northern Plains of US. Briefly explaining my objectives of research, i would be performing steady state and dynamic tests in labs to determine the R value of the strawbale specimen. This value would be used in energy modeling software to simulate the building performance of an already existing strawbale house. The results of this dynamic simulation would be compared with the temperature data that are being recorded using HOBO of the existing structure also used for simulation. For the purpose of simulation, I am considering eQuest but    DOE 3.0 also seems to be appropriate.

My concerns, for which I wish to seek suggestions, are how do I plug in the R value obtained from the lab experiments into eQuest. Is it possible to do so with any softwares efficiently. Also, I am not sure, how would I convert temperature data to be able to compare them with the results of the simulation model. 

Any time taken out to put down their thoughts of suggestions would be sincerely appreciated. It has been quite interesting to read the various questions, concerns and comments that come online through this list serve!

Thankyou very much.

Priya

Does anyone know how to model Active Chill beams in

and if so where would that be in eQUEST or is there
another method of doing it.
thanks,

Yi,
 
You might want to look at DOE2.2 (equest). You can now create polygons with 128 points which allows you to closely model a circle.  The program also has a Sunspace feature that makes it easier to model atrium spaces.  The program is free at doe2.com.
 
I am not aware of a program that lets you model a circular space without using flat sections.

DOE-2.1e or eQuest DOE-2.2 can do such a building in segments. 12 sides
should be enough. It's all the same space, correct? I forgot how many wall
can happen in each space, but it has to be more than 8.

Are you looking at only HVAC energy? Or total space energy?

I believe if you make both systems package (PVAVS, for example), the DOE-2
(2.1E or 2.2) will show the HVAC energy within the SS reports as split. How
this is subdivided in the Metering assignments is unknown to me.

You said you wanted to only look at HVAC energy, and not as a Meter to
attach to an Energy Rate. I believe you can find your answers in the raw SS
printouts.

SOMEDAY, maybe these reports in MUCH neater and client presentable formats
may be available at the eQuest Windows level. Scott and Jeff, isn't that one
of your goals for eQuest?

I am simulating a building with eQUEST and I am having
some problems to read the amount of energy consumption
 in the perimeter and the core. To tackle this
problem, I installed 2 systems specifically for the
core and the perimeter spaces and also installed a
second electric meter that will read energy
consumption at the perimeters. I was surprized to find
that the tools did not split the energy use in the
core and perimeter as I expected it. It summed up all
the HVAC into the default meter and only split lights
and small power into the other meter leaving HVAC at
the second meter to "0".
does anyone know another way to split energy use in
the perimeter and the core so that I coul look only at
the core specifically?
thanks.

I am doing some modelling work on an earth coupled duct at the moment. I
have used CFD (CFX 4) to model the duct in 3D, including the concrete
wall. It has shown that the duct surface temperature does vary
significantly along its length. This variation in the driving
temperature difference is more significant than variations in fluid
temperature would be in a hydronic system, as this temp. diff. is
smaller. I have also done some 2D finite volume calcs that include about
10m depth of soil. As it is a 2D model it has been possible to run with
weather data for multiple years. This has shown that the temp.
distribution does not reach steady-periodic conditions until several
years have past (about 10 years in my case).  The long term rise/fall in
temp depends on the annual balance of heating/cooling loads. This
characteristic is well known in the geothermal heat pump community but
it appears often neglected in air coupled designs.
 
I am keen to hear of the experience of others. I can suggest another
reference: F. Al-Ajmi (2002). Potential cooling of the subsoil
environment in dry desert climate implicated by means of Earth-Air Heat
exchanger in domestic dwellings. PhD Thesis, Loughborough University

Dear Hugues,

there are two different kinds of simulation tools for earth-to-air 
exchanger available:

stand alone simulation software (without the possibility to calculate more 
then the earth-to-air exchanger ):

WKM from Huber (http://www.igjzh.com/huber/)
GAEA from the Uni Siegen 
(http://nesa1.uni-siegen.de/index.htm?/softlab/gaea.htm)
some self made capacitance models from our department (in matlab and fortran)..

some modules or types from simulation tools (with the possibility to 
calculate the hole air system including the building)

Trnsys 15:      Type 160 (S. Holst)
                 Type  260  air-to-soil heat exchangers ("earth channels") 
(P. Hollmuller)

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] eQUEST Question: Perimeter and Core
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200311231219.AA1944578pd80000488913@gard.com>

I am simulating a building with eQUEST and I am having
some problems to read the amount of energy consumption
 in the perimeter and the core. To tackle this
problem, I installed 2 systems specifically for the
core and the perimeter spaces and also installed a
second electric meter that will read energy
consumption at the perimeters. I was surprized to find
that the tools did not split the energy use in the
core and perimeter as I expected it. It summed up all
the HVAC into the default meter and only split lights
and small power into the other meter leaving HVAC at
the second meter to "0".
does anyone know another way to split energy use in
the perimeter and the core so that I coul look only at
the core specifically?
thanks.

An "earth channel" module is available for TRNSYS 15. It was developed 
and validated by Pierre Hollmuller (Universit? de Gen?ve) and it is 
widely used in Europe to design such systems.

The module is not part of the standard TRNSYS library but it is 
available from Transsolar.

For more information:

   (go to "component models" for an overview of non-standard components)

- Transsolar website: http://www.transsolar.com/ts/english/maineng.htm

Bonjour Hugues,

I'm unaware of any single program that automatically sets this up. A very discrete finite-... 3D conduction model would be desirable, but depending on your specific needs, ESP-r would be a very good candidate as an annual assessment tool. I've used ESP-r for underground air culvert assessment in the past and a couple of graduate students have used ESP-r for similar studies (Y. Jeong, a grad student at Concordia, and another student in Norway (a PhD student I believe) have both used ESP-r for assessing the Media School in Norway, which has an underground air culvert).

In Jeong's case, the culvert is modeled as one zone, but it is fairly straightfoward in ESP-r to subdivide this in, let's say, 10 zones (e.g., a 40m culvert could be made up of ten 4m segments) - that's what I do. This will give you a more detailed assessment, e.g., of culvert surface temperatures along the airflow path (useful for condensation assessment or to see just how effective the first segments of the culvert are in relation to the last ones). ESP-r also allows you to set up an airflow network, but 'scheduled' airflows might be OK for your needs.

The main challenge is setting up the surface boundary conditions. Without setting up a 3D conduction model in ESP-r (available, but not for the faint-hearted), you'll have to specify boundary conditions for each surface. If the culvert is deep enough, you can just feed it monthly ground profiles for ~? of the surfaces, with harmonics calculated with standard models (see Maitos and Argiriou) - the same models used for ground-coupled heat pump simulation. If it's deep enough, the daily variations will be minor (~ ?1?C during the course of a month). The remaining ~? of the surfaces will more likely feel the effect of the nearby ground surface, so ambient air might be more suitable as a surface boundary condition. If the culvert is very close to the ground surface, then it's a bit more tricky - maybe ~? of the surfaces need ambient air as a boundary condition. You can of course 'tweak' the model to see just how sensible it is to variable changes.

Another point is setting up the right surface element 'constructions' so on one hand it remains numerically stable, and on the other the constructions remain 'thick' enough so that using monthly profiles remains valid (at least conceptually). 

Transsolar have modeled culverts for other energy consultants in the past - maybe they've set up some basic modeling approach in TRNSYS (?). Simpler empirical approaches are available: Argiriou and Maitos give an overview of existing models found in the literature.

Good luck,

----

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Announcing ESP-r/Radiance ISO download image for Windows PCs.
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200311210736.AA3611500pd80000485801@gard.com>


The Energy Systems Research Group (ESRU) announces the availability of
a convenient way for Windows PC users to run ESP-r and Radiance without
the hassles of setting up a Linux partition or buying a workstation...

Ever wanted to take on heavy duty simulation tasks, but were put off by
the hassles and operating system requirements? ESRU have taken the
guesswork out of setting up ESP-r and Radiance on a PC by bundling the
relevant portions of the Cygwin environment with pre formed ESP-r and
Radiance distributions, helper applications and installation
instructions/scripts in a convenient ISO file which you can download
from our software distribution page at <http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk>
(Software -> ESP-r -> downloads -> ESP-r_Cygwin_binaries) and burn to a
CD and install.

No longer do you need to select individual Cygwin modules, we have
gathered the relevant portions of Cgywin onto the CD. Confused about
where it all goes - we have written clear instructions and created
scripts to setup ESP-r and Radiance so that once the install is
complete, you can get to down to work.

Included in the CD are a recent (October 2003) Cywgin setup.exe and
Cygwin download cache folder, Radiance 3.5 (except for TIFF related
modules), ESP-r (November 2003 build), instructions and scripts as well
as executables for several helper applications.

No network connection is needed during the install process, but if you
want to update Cygwin you can use the setup.exe for this. If you want
to customize ESP-r we have included a ESP-r source distribution and
you can also check the ESRU web site for fresh distributions.

eQuest (DOE2.2) and DOE2.1 don't model air flow so you have to make some 
assumptions based on the design of the underfloor system in question.  You 
can't outright take a credit for lower fan energy unless the designer 
actually design a lower fan static system.  Many underfloor systems use a 
higher supply temperature (69F instead of 55F) but that has to be confirmed 
for your case. In come climates the humidity dictates that you need to 
supply at lower than 69F. Some claim that you can model with a higher space 
setpoint temperature due to the stratification of temperatures but that 
depends on the type of diffusers and the ceiling height in question.  Most 
North American underfloor systems use a Krantz style diffuser which mixes 
in the zone level.  This is not a true displacement ventilation system.

I have seen underfloor designs which save energy and I have seen some that 
use more energy due to the particular design.  You need to confirm what the 
designer is specifying.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200311141246.AA4620468pd80000476498@gard.com>

Hi,
I'm trying to model an underfloor air system in eQUEST for a project that I
am doing. Its an office building. What is the best way to go about it? What
would the reduction in static pressure on the fans be?

Thanks

Chip:

The EnergyPlus materials data sets are taken from the BLAST and DOE-2 
data sets which were taken primarily from AHSRAE HOF tables, most 
likely the 1977 edition.

Looking at the 1977 ASHRAE HOF, there are no specific sources cited 
in the tables, although there are some ASHVE papers and some books 
listed in the bibliography.  The footnotes in the table point to the 
manufacturer as the ultimate source.  So, I poked around USG's 
website and found very little to help.  Density is generally 
available, and thermal resistance is available for some products, but 
I found no mention of specific heat, so that's not going to be much 
help.  This is an interesting question.  Please report you conclusion 
back to us here.

Have you looked in the popular architectural reference named 
something like Mechanical and Electrical in Buildings (I think it's 
usually referred to as MEB or something like that)?

Hi Chip,

	For windows related thermo-physical properties of materials, NFRC has
conducted small research project at Umass to research different sources,
including existing values used at NFRC, and to publish consolidated and
referenced properties.  In this project we have used variety of sources, and
we have compiled relatively large list, which was published in NFRC 101
(available for download from www.nfrc.org).  We thought that out of all of
references, the best single and updated source on thermophysical properties
of building materials was European Commission sponsored study (Anderson et.
al. 1999.  "Analysis, selection and Statistical Treatment of Thermal
Properties of Building Materials for the Preparation of Harmonised Design
Values").  The data was well documented and properly sorted with recommended
values at the end.  We used quite a bit from that source for NFRC project.
If you would like, I can send you a copy of this report.

I find that using sources like Toulukian with several hundred entries for
each typical material is equivalent to starting a major research project and
is therefore probably impractical (unless of course you have very specific
material subjected to a large range of temperatures).

One other note. ASHRAE has funded research project through TC 4.4 to
document and update thermophysical properties of building materials, but to
my knowledge that was never completed due to the default from a PI.

Regards,
Charlie Curcija

Dear all --

I am working on ASHRAE 1199-RP, "Updating the ASHRAE/ACCA Residential Loads
Calculation Procedures and Data".

The revised method under development is based on a 24 hour design-day
simulation using a heat balance model.

In order to fully "package" the method for end use, thermal properties
values must be selected for a moderately inclusive set of construction
materials.

There is often disagreement among all the common sources for materials
properties (ASHRAE HOF tables, standard values built into simulation
programs etc.).

For example, the specific heat of gypsum wall board is given as 1.09
kJ/kg-K (0.26 Btu/lb-F) in ASHRAE 2001 HOF Chapter 25, Table 4 (and several
other sources that I've found that cite ASHRAE).  There is no source given
for this value (unless I'm missing something).  Meanwhile, the California
Energy Commission has selected 0.837 kJ/kg-K (0.20 Btu/lb-F) as their
standard value for compliance simulations, again without documentation.

For 1199-RP, I would like to resolve at least the glaring
discrepancies.  Beyond that, it would help the field if we could work
toward a set of documented consensus values for common use.

Can anyone point me to authoritative sources for info that you have found

Chip,

Here are some sources:
Touloukian, Y. S. et al Thermophysical Properties of Matter, Plenum
Press, New York I think it is a 10 Volume set

The Canadian Rubber Company (CRC) has chemical handbooks that may have
many of these properties.

I just checked my copy of Incropera & DeWitt "Fundamentals of Heat and
Mass Transfer." Wiley & Sons, New York. It has thermophysical properties
in the Appendices and references a variety of sources including
Touloukian.  It has been a while since I looked at it but I think the
Touloukian series references the work which generated the thermophysical
data.

You might also talk to Fred Winklemann at LBNL about where they got
their data for DOE-2.  Presumably the EnergyPlus folks are updating
their material properties and can also share their sources.

Dear all --

I am working on ASHRAE 1199-RP, "Updating the ASHRAE/ACCA Residential
Loads 
Calculation Procedures and Data".

The revised method under development is based on a 24 hour design-day 
simulation using a heat balance model.

In order to fully "package" the method for end use, thermal properties 
values must be selected for a moderately inclusive set of construction 
materials.

There is often disagreement among all the common sources for materials 
properties (ASHRAE HOF tables, standard values built into simulation 
programs etc.).

For example, the specific heat of gypsum wall board is given as 1.09 
kJ/kg-K (0.26 Btu/lb-F) in ASHRAE 2001 HOF Chapter 25, Table 4 (and
several 
other sources that I've found that cite ASHRAE).  There is no source
given 
for this value (unless I'm missing something).  Meanwhile, the
California 
Energy Commission has selected 0.837 kJ/kg-K (0.20 Btu/lb-F) as their 
standard value for compliance simulations, again without documentation.

For 1199-RP, I would like to resolve at least the glaring 
discrepancies.  Beyond that, it would help the field if we could work 
toward a set of documented consensus values for common use.

Can anyone point me to authoritative sources for info that you have

Without knowing more details, it is hard to say.  You might want to check what your floor is doing.  If you have slab on grade, you need to make an adjustement to the effective area and U-Value in contact with the ground.  There are some 2.1E supplements that cover this.  If you don't make this adjustment you can end up sucking heat from the space into the slab and end up with a heating load ...

  Subject: [BLDG-SIM] DOE2.1e Sunspace


  Hello,
  I am working on a model of a lab building with a two-story corridor along the east facade of the building. There is a large wall of glazing on the east side and an opening between the floors to allow for natural ventilation. I am attempting to model a vented sunspace using DOE2.1e (using a Residential System with hot water heat - RESYS) in order to take advantage of the mass wall along the west side of the corridor. There is no direct venting to the surrounding zones (only free circulation from the lower to the upper level with louvered openings to the outside on each floor). The output file is indicating negative cooling energy use for the sunspace system. There are two other systems that require mechanical cooling, but the negative cooling energy in the sunspace is offsetting this energy use which results in a negative overall value for the building. My first thought was that heat transfer from the sunspace was cooling the surrounding zones, but the zones with mechanical cooling are not directly adjacent to the sunspace and have high internal loads. Does anyone have any experience with this situation? I would appreciate any assistance.
  Thanks,

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] DOE2.1e Sunspace
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200311061029.AA2912437pd80000466030@gard.com>

Hello,
I am working on a model of a lab building with a two-story corridor along the east facade of the building. There is a large wall of glazing on the east side and an opening between the floors to allow for natural ventilation. I am attempting to model a vented sunspace using DOE2.1e (using a Residential System with hot water heat - RESYS) in order to take advantage of the mass wall along the west side of the corridor. There is no direct venting to the surrounding zones (only free circulation from the lower to the upper level with louvered openings to the outside on each floor). The output file is indicating negative cooling energy use for the sunspace system. There are two other systems that require mechanical cooling, but the negative cooling energy in the sunspace is offsetting this energy use which results in a negative overall value for the building. My first thought was that heat transfer from the sunspace was cooling the surrounding zones, but the zones with mechanical cooling are not directly adjacent to the sunspace and have high internal loads. Does anyone have any experience with this situation? I would appreciate any assistance.
Thanks,

Hello,

There are two goals I wish to achieve with this e-mail:

1.	Get assistance in selecting an appropriate simulation program for Georgia Tech
2.	Develop a Building Simulation Program Users Group for Metro Atlanta, Georgia, USA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~'
As Utilities Analyst at Georgia Tech my job duties include analyzing past energy consumption, forecasting future consumption, and making design recommendations to reduce consumption for the following:

*	A variety of campus buildings occupying over 10 million square feet, including a couple built before 1900
*	A central heating and cooling distribution system that had over 30 miles of steam mains 20 years ago and has been expanded
*	A fully enclosed Olympic natatorium
*	Over 500,000 square feet of research space requiring 100% outside air built in the past five years

Selecting the most appropriate simulation program for Georgia Tech includes evaluating the purchase cost, the capability of simulating the buildings and systems listed above, the availability of environmental data and the learning curve.  Another aid to selection is the ability to visit sites that are using a program.  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"
Please contact me via e-mail if you are interested in Goal 1, Goal 2 or both.

Sincerely,

You can find some information and references in one of the MS theses 
available on the Solar Energy Lab website:

Magoo, N. (M.S., 2003) "High-Temperature Refrigerated Warehouse 
Operation under Real-Time Pricing of Electricity"

http://sel.me.wisc.edu/publications/theses/theses2.html
or direct link:
http://sel.me.wisc.edu/theses/Magoo03.zip

Section 2.A discusses infiltration loads.

Kind regards,

Micha?l Kummert

If you download and install EE4 from http://www.ee4.com you get 44 CWEC 
files.  You get a spreadsheet which shows the city for each cryptic weather 
file name.

Subject: [bldg-sim] Cooling loads with Refrigerated display cases
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200311031420.AA2014296pd80000462107@gard.com>

I?m trying to reconcile cooling loads of a PSZ system with refrigerant 
display cases in the zone.

My problem is I can take the space loads (wall conduct, solar gains, 
infiltration, etc.) from hourly loads reports, the net display case 
cooling loads (negative load on zone) from the hourly systems report and 
calculate the hourly outside air cooling loads based on the hourly flow 
rates reported in hourly systems report. If I then compare these values 
to the cooling loads (taken from hourly systems output) I get nowhere 
near the same results. The systems output values are ~ x5 larger.

I know this over-simplifies how DOE handles cooling loads, but you would 
expect the results to be comparable. Are display case zone loads 
(REFG-ZONE-LOADS) totally applied to the zone, or is it only a fraction?

Any help to get me going in the correct direction would be greatly 
appreciated.

Thanks.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200311031203.AA0355406pd80000461941@gard.com>

Hi everybody!

My Name is David, from the University of Zaragoza(Spain). I?m trying to know the energy demand of buildings for a cogeneration project using eQUEST/DOE-2, I have many questions because nobody can teach me here. The most important ones are:

1: How can I get Spanish weather files compatibles with DOE-2, at the moment I?m using Rome weather like if it was Madrid weather, and I don?t know if the differences can be passable

2: In order to have the heating and cooling hourly demands of a building. 
 
I suppose these should be independient of the HVAC system chosen but now I?m considering any HVAC system and that the fuel that a 100% efficient boiler is using is the heat demand, the same for the cooling. The problem is that if I change the HVAC system the fuel demand also varies
 
Is there any way to get these demands independently of the HVAC chosen, maybe from the loads calculations?    
 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH

Greetings

David
