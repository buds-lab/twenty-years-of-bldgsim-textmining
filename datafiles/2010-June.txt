I can "third" that :). Also, if you are lazy like me Dr. Spitler would be ideal as advisor to keep you on track.

Hi Brad,
You could also try Oklahoma State University and work under Dr. Daniel Fisher- He is one of the main developers for EnergyPlus. I have personally done my Masters under his guidance in Energyplus and have myself been a developer for EnergyPlus and wrote the Mixed air (Economizer) module in it.
The course work in HVAC is also very profound at Okstate!!
Thanks

Hi Brad,

I think that you have a lot of good choices. In addition to Univ. of Colorado and Penn State, there are very good programs at Texas A&M, Univ of Kansas, University of Wisconsin, Colorado State, Arizona State University and Purdue University. I am sure there are more, but those are the ones I can think of off the top of my head.

 

Good luck,

Shanta Tucker

The Building Systems Program at the University of Colorado has turned  
out very successful energy analysts and engineers for the past couple  
of decades. It covers a breadth of topics and is an engineering  
curriculum with both Masters and PhD options.

Hi Diwanshu,

Since you are posting to this group I am going to give an example related to buildings. Let me start with modeling. You can mathematically model the physic of heat transfer in a building. This is generally referred to as modeling. The advantage of this is that you can simulate the heat transfer in the building without actually have to build it or build a scale model. The inputs of the building model such as window solar heat gain coefficient etc. can be varied within some constraints to determine the disadvantage/advantage of that on the building energy consumption thereby optimizing the building to consume the least amount of energy. The varying of window solar heat coefficient in the above example would be referred to as parametric analysis. This is a simplistic yet time consuming methodology of optimizing the building energy efficiency feature.

Hope this helps.

Hi Diwanshu,

Just to expand on Haider's message, parametric analysis is applied to a base building design to see the effect of changing (usually one or 2) design parameters on a particular performance variable. The results are plotted as a curve or a series of curves to illustrate the variation graphically. For example, you might be interested to know the effect on building carbon emissions of varying the amount of glazing in the building and you might want to know this for 3 different types of glazing. The graph below was generated by DesignBuilder using the EnergyPlus simulation engine by selecting the parameters to vary. Because glazing provides both benefits (heat in winter and light) and penalties (cooling load), parametric analysis can give useful insights into the relationship between the design parameters and a chosen performance parameter (annual carbon emissions in this case). In the example graph below there is a minimum carbon emissions at just below 80% glazing and this might help guide an architect at early stages of the design process towards a basic optimised configuration.

Working on a project that has a couple of floors shelled (unconditioned) for future expansion. We are running an energy model for LEED certification.

Should we include those floors for the EAc1 submittal, or can we build our model to exclude those floors? The floors are around 20% of the total building square footage

You have to simulate them as built-out floors using default office
occupancies, LPD, equipment, etc, along the guidelines for C&S modeling.

Generally, I think you run them with baseline HVAC unless you have a 
central system that future tenants can "plug into".

Or if a performance specification for fit out exists then go with that.

Diwanshu,

Good question. Parametric modeling can be just about anything you need 
it to be. To me, it means a model that has one or more variations of 
some parameters that you want to quantify the differences between. For 
example, comparing annual heating and cooling energy use for a building 
with and without shading. And/or the daylighting impacts of that shading.

It's never an idealized optimization, but if you know something about 
building science and the desires of your client/architect, it's a good 
way to demonstrate the impact of changing whatever design parameters 
you're studying. The tricky part is knowing what parameters to change 
and how.

I believe my take away is: Modeling of an existing building where you can verify against actual
performance is referred to as "Live Modeling" (as explained by b.fountain). Parametric modeling has to do with when you change one or more parameters in your model , basically for comparison between the baseline and the proposed model. When one is performing a parametric analysis, the baseline model doesn't necessarily has to match with the actual building. Having said that, parametric analysis should be common in new constructions or sensitivity analysis of parameters(example of window glazing provided by Andy and Solar heat gain coefficient provided by Haider). Additionally, live analysis should be helpful when one is performing an energy analysis of an existing construction.
Please correct me if I am missing anything.

"Live modelling" is not as clearly defined.  I can think of 2 contexts for
live modelling --

1) where you take a preliminary model into a Charrette type enviroment
with the design team and then dynamically update and run the model as the
design team brainstorms to show the impact of various design options. 
(usually stressful and fun)

2) modelling of an existing building where you can verify against actual
performance and further you can populate the model with "live" building
data.

Please excuse the cross-postings...

 

 

Just a few weeks to go!

 

                                 IBPSA-USA
  International Building Performance Simulation Association
                                USA Affiliate

            IBPSA-USA invites you to join us in Albuquerque
                       for our Summer 2010 meeting!


              IBPSA-USA MEETING ANNOUNCEMENT
                    Dinner RSVP requested (see below)
                4:00-9:00 PM, Saturday, June 26, 2010
                        Albuquerque, New Mexico

 

 

Location :

DoubleTree Albuquerque

201 Marquette

Albuquerque, NM 87102

505.247.7000

 

Schedule: 

4-6pm IBPSA-USA Meeting (Agenda includes BEMBOOK + more!)

6-7pm Social Hour

7-9pm Dinner/Lecture

We are honored to invite Doug Hittle to lead our evening presentation
entitled, " Simulation Answers to Tough Questions: Proof by Anecdote."

 

Abstract: This discussion asserts that there are some architectural and
engineering questions concerning building and HVAC system designs that
aren't well answered using a handbook and calculator. I believe that the
IBPSA audience already embraces this hypothesis. This presentation shows
some interesting cases where design issues could not be answered without
computer models. Indeed, without computer calculations the questions
might not have even been asked in the first place or designers would
have had to rely on RE's.

 

Bio: Doug Hittle is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Mechanical
Engineering, Colorado State University. He is an ASHRAE Fellow and
recipient of ASHRAE's Distinguished Service Award. He matriculated from
the University of Illinois under the tutelage of Professor Curt
Pedersen.  Hittle also attended the founding IBPSA meetings.

While at the Construction Engineering Research Laboratory Hittle was
peace negotiator and front man for the BLAST development team and served
on the Advisory Panel for the development of DOE-2. He taught HVAC
design, solar energy engineering, thermal sciences, and automatic
control while at Colorado State and Purdue Universities. 

 

Dinner Menu: Painted Mesa buffet. It includes roasted pork loin with red
chili cream sauce, carne asada served with lime cilantro sauce
espagnole, verde ride, southwestern ratatouille, tortillas, house salad,
green chili stew and a variety of drinks. The price will be $40/person,
cash or check only, no credit cards please.

 

Please RSVP to Shanta Tucker (shanta.tucker at atelierten.com) by June 4th.

 

Looking forward to seeing you all there,

Shanta Tucker, Secretary IBPSA-USA

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Custom EPW (weather) Files
Message-ID: <142364.96185.qm@web53704.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Hello,
This question is primarily about EnergyPlus, but since other programs also use EPW files, I'm curious about other programs as well.

There are many categories of data in an EPW file.? Which categories does EnergyPlus (or eQuest/DOE2, etc) actually use?? 

Using an Onset?weather station, we are making a custom EPW file.??This weather station will provide: Dry Bulb Temp, Dew Point, Relative Humidity, Wind Speed, Wind Direction, and Global Horizontal Radiation, from which we can calculated Direct Normal Radiation and Diffuse Horizontal.? Therefore, we do not have: Atmospheric Station Pressure, Extraterrestrial Radiation, Illuminance values, Luminance values, Total and Opaque?Sky Cover, Visibility, Ceiling Height, Present Weather Observation and Codes, Precipitable Water, Aerosol Optical Depth, Snow Depth, Days Since Last Snowfall, etc.? What is best the approach for these categories: a) import dummy data, for example from a local TMY file, b) leave them blank, c) enter "9", d) some other approach?

Thank you in advance for any advice.
Sincerely,
Holly

Message-ID: <CD91BC49A883474EAC61C23BC0F0071B014976E9D393@EXCHANGE10.campus.tue.nl>

Two fully funded building performance simulation PhD projects are currently available at Eindhoven University of Technology. These are part of the just started Dutch research programme "Climate Proof Cities" which involves a large number of universities and research institutes. The aim of this programme is to generate knowledge that is necessary for adapting the built environment in order to cope with future climate change.

The projects in our group are:

 *   Impacts of climate change on the indoor environment and energy consumption - the focus is on further development of high-resolution whole-building simulation (combination of building energy simulation, building envelope heat-air-moisture transfer models and computational fluid dynamics models) and application of these models to predict indoor environmental parameters and energy consumption.
Further details at http://jobs.tue.nl/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=3085&p_web_page_id=109709
 *   Climate change adaptation measures: adaptive buildings and occupants - the focus is on adapting the building envelope and incorporating user behaviour in the above high-resolution whole-building simulation models.
Further details at http://jobs.tue.nl/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=3085&p_web_page_id=109720

Please don't hesitate to contact me for further information.

I would appreciate it very much if you could forward this message to potential applicants.

Thanks in advance!

Kevin,
 
One reference for calculating U-Factors for wood-framed, metal-framed
and masonry walls is the 2009 ASHRAE Handbook - Fundamentals, Chapter
27. There is a section on "Two-dimensional U-factor calculation", which
describes the parallel-path, isothermal-planes, zone and modified zone
methods of calculating overall heat transfer rates through wall
assemblies. Earlier versions of Fundamentals (2005, 2001 etc.) will also
have some background information.

Kevin et al:
 
Not sure if this is what you are looking for, but at any rate it is a very
good resource to share...
 
The folks at ORNL have developed a pretty cool 'calculator' which determines
complex wall R-values using the 'Modified Zone" method described in the 2009
ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals: Chapter 27. It's very easy to use, and
generates 'clear wall' R-Values for a user defined 'sandwich'.  It also
provides a good visual as to how "clear wall" and vs. "whole wall" R-values
differ (for a particular 'hard coded WWR and user defined fabric
description).
 
The calculator provides results for a limited set of various 'common'
configurations, and provides a good 'QA/QC" process if you choose to build
your own (spreadsheet based?) tool to expand it's capabilities 

Here's the link:
 
http://www.ornl.gov/sci/roofs+walls/AWT/InteractiveCalculators/NS/Calc.htm 
 
There's also a 'tease' on this page
http://www.ornl.gov/sci/roofs+walls/AWT/InteractiveCalculators/rvalueinfo.ht
m
suggesting the folks at ORNL have plans "in the works" to assist analysts
with developing fabric descriptions:
 
New Features Include: Generation of Input Files for Whole Building Energy
Simulation Programs (in development) 
 
Have fun!

Kevin,
 
One reference for calculating U-Factors for wood-framed, metal-framed and
masonry walls is the 2009 ASHRAE Handbook - Fundamentals, Chapter 27. There
is a section on "Two-dimensional U-factor calculation", which describes the
parallel-path, isothermal-planes, zone and modified zone methods of
calculating overall heat transfer rates through wall assemblies. Earlier
versions of Fundamentals (2005, 2001 etc.) will also have some background
information.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] effective R-value cavity insulation
 
I am curious what the relationship is between cavity depth, rated
insulation, and effective insulation in framed walls.  I am referencing the
ASHRAE 90.1 doc because it is really the only one I have on this subject.  I
have charted Table A9.2B and a logarithmic trendline appears to be a good
fit for extrapolating.  If anyone in academia, industry, or the societies
has more information on this subject I would certainly be grateful to
receive a good lead.  Thank you.

	elementary school designs
Message-ID: <fc.004c4e072ab179d2004c4e072ab179d2.2ab180af@interact.ccsd.net>

My department is interested in hiring an energy modeling consultant to model four elementary school designs for the purpose of evaluating the relative performance of these designs.  The four designs were created by four different architectural firms who
are involved in a competition which will result in only three designs being retained for future construction.  My preference is for a consultant experienced in using e-Quest.  The intent is to base this analysis around the DOE-2.2 engine.  No firm
currently employed by or listed on Clark County School District engineering lists will be considered.

If you fit the description, please email me your company's qualifications, experience (especially with e-Quest) etc. to: "tdstrucely at interact.ccsd.net".  I intend to choose up to three firms from resumes and proceed to a RFQ which will contain specifics
on this modeling project.  This does not require a fancy, customized response.  Basic information on education, certifications and experience should be issued on letterhead.  Customer references are required with e-Quest projects preferred.  Please
forward your qualifications NLT Friday, June 11 to the email address.

Dear all,

I am interested in long-term energy performance in commercial buildings. I can not find publications about actual energy data (5 years or more) and analysis of annual difference of these energy use for a commercial building. Anyone knows where there is some relevant research about this topic?
I would appreciate if anyone can provide some information about this topic.
Thanks in advance,

Message-ID: <B05ECD87EE29834B92835EBF46AD8597015003A0@PINKFLOYD.michaelsengineering.local>

Does anyone have any advice on modeling a VAV air handler with face and
bypass dampers? Essentially I have a set of dampers with a heating coil
before the cooling coil. When in heating only the discharge air
temperature is reset based between 55F and 65F. In cooling the DAT is
between 55F and 59F. Chillers and CHW loop is set to demand. 

I had tried modeling a preheat coil to simulate the heating coil being
before the cooling coil, but the results were not as expected. When I
looked at the hourly reports I found the following: 

1)	Space temperatures for the unit were above the heating set-point
and below the cooling set-point. Yet, the cooling coil was activated. I
have a suspicion that this is due to equest turning on cooling coil if
there is any chance a space may need cooling but have been unable to
confirm. In addition, the given RAT, MAT, DAT temperatures due not make
sense. For example: 
 	RAT=67F
	MAT=55F
	DAT (off cooling coil)=48F with cooling coil running and OAT
below 32F. 
2)	The %OA is constant even at night. Cfm/per has been specified at
the zone level. Should it be at the system level?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Message-ID: <757483.22969.qm@web44804.mail.sp1.yahoo.com>

Dear Colleagues 
 
The
objective of this questionnaire survey is to understand the role of 
building
performance simulation during the early design stage. The questionnaire 
survey
will be part of a PhD study aims to develop an approach for intelligent building envelope design, to determine the performance of building envelope technologies and design
alternatives in the early design stage.
 
You are invited

Vikram/Jorge...

 

I'm going to take a leap and assume we're talking about EPAct tax
deductions (not credits).

 

If that's the case, Section 179D (c)(2) of EPAct defines what is meant
by 90.1-2001 in the context of EPAct:

 

Standard 90.1-2001.--The term `Standard 90.1-2001' 

        means Standard 90.1-2001 of the American Society of Heating, 

        Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineers and the 

        Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (as in effect 

        on April 2, 2003)

 

I bring this up because Addendum G (which revised both LPD tables
heavily) was approved by ANSI on August 6, 2003.  My resulting
interpretation has been that, for the purposes of EPAct tax deductions,
the original LPD tables 9.3.1.1 and 9.3.1.2 are to be used (with the
exception of warehouses as defined by the EPAct legislation, of course).

 

I'd suggest using the 1.8W/SF figure, if you are doing space-by-space.
If you want to use the simpler whole-building method, you may find
University or Healthcare figures to be applicable, based on the nature
of the lab work.

I'm looking at the federal tax credit lighting requirements for a Lab
project. The problem is the ASHRAE 90.1-2001 standard that this is based
off does not have lighting requirements for labs. Does anyone know of a
good w/sf number to use as the baseline for this?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Warehouse
Message-ID: <fae4877cd49e.4c10d3c0@iit.edu>

I was just asked this question
 
Does  a 1.5 million sqft  ground floor warehouse have to comply with the baseline system in Table G3.1.1A of ASHRAE Std90 (page 176, 2004 Std)?  The baseline system would be 7.  
Fan Control: Packaged rooftop variable air volume with reheat 
Cooling Type: Chilled Water
Heating Type: Hot Water Fossil Fuel Boiler
 
Assume the warehouse stores lumber or auto tires or some other stuff that is indestructible and does not decay, freeze or breathe.  Does it have to comply with the envelope, lighting, mechanical and domestic HW standards?   Why can?t a space like this use several packaged rooftop units with gas furnace heating and DX coils for cooling?  Does it have to have chillers, cooling towers, HW boilers and VAV systems with reheat?
 
If there is occasional people activity in the space, what would be the ventilation and lighting requirements?   I would think the design of a warehouse depend on what is being stored and the activities in the space.  There is a wide variety of possibilities.

What's the point in duscussing modular plant arrangements when the
calculations we use are outdated (ASHRAE & CIBSE steady-state) and result in
gross oversizing from the outset?

This is the real problem we face.

Since I got no replies, it was must have been a dumb question.  I assume Std90 systems and plant are for the baseline only and for the proposed you can use something else.  A proposed packaged VAVS with furnace heating and DX cooling produced nearly the same kbtu/sqft/yr (0.1 difference) as the baseline of chilled water and hot water.

I?ve modeled a few self storage facilities before, and also had this question.  As far as I could tell, System 7 really was the right system for my baseline building, and my condensing furnaces with split system AC units actually had less energy consumption than the chilled water / boiler system.  Go figure?

There was a question about the water which is wasted while waiting for the
pipes to heat up, such as in a shower.

From my memory, the concept was that the water you waste waiting for the
pipes to heat up would be directed to water the lawn since it is 'clean
water'. (At least in the presentation I endured.)

There are many things you can do with this wasted warm up water.  Most common
uses are toilets or irrigation.  It could be used in the same fashion as

The warehouse I am looking at is a rectangular building, just under 1.5 million sf and with a ceiling height of 41 ft.  Maximum occupancy is 50 people mostly in 12,000 sf of administrative offices with 10 ft ceiling. Why maintain the entire mass of air occupying the space volume in the warehouse at 75 deg F in summer and 70 deg F in winter?  Can the proposed warehouse model use just ventilation and save energy.  The percent energy savings for LEED certification is enormous.  Mechanical floors are heated (to prevent pipe freezing) and ventilated.  Underground parking is ventilated.  Does ASHRAE Std90 for commercial buildings include industrial buildings (steel plants)?  The definition only mentions area and number floors.  I might have got it wrong.  I have only worked on commercial that house people.

For LEED 3.0 (2009) the wording is "Upload supporting documentation with PMV/PPD calculation, ASHRAE comfort tool results, and/or psychrometric comfort zone chart from Standard 55"
For LEED 2.2 you just had to provide a narrative, but 3.0 requires the actual results from the calculations.  I may just have to buy ASHRAE's "Thermal Comfort Tool", I was just hoping there was something else available.

The ASRHAE comfort tool is very basic. Personally for compliance
purposes it is just as easy to plot these design conditions on a
psychrometric chart if you don't want to spend the money.

90.1- in the User's Manual does specify that for spaces that are not conditioned (as warehouses fall into this) your baseline shall have no heating and cooling

 

Page G21 of the User's Manual specifically reads in reference to Table F3.1-10 the following

 

"This requirement only applies to conditioned spaces in the building.  Semiheated spaces would only have a heating system; unconditioned spaces would have neither heating nor cooling systems."

The warehouse I am looking at is a rectangular building, just under 1.5 million sf and with a ceiling height of 41 ft.  Maximum occupancy is 50 people mostly in 12,000 sf of administrative offices with 10 ft ceiling. Why maintain the entire mass of air occupying the space volume in the warehouse at 75 deg F in summer and 70 deg F in winter?  Can the proposed warehouse model use just ventilation and save energy.  The percent energy savings for LEED certification is enormous.  Mechanical floors are heated (to prevent pipe freezing) and ventilated.  Underground parking is ventilated.  Does ASHRAE Std90 for commercial buildings include industrial buildings (steel plants)?  The definition only mentions area and number floors.  I might have got it wrong.  I have only worked on commercial that house people.

There are some equations to calculate them. The psychrometric chart does not
help lot. I used to calculate PMV/PPD with my own VB 6. But there are a few
important PMV/PPD equations behind the VB6.0 from some references that I
forgot.

There is nothing to do with climate consultants, BTW.

Min is right. ASHRAE standard 55-2004 provided computer codes in the
appendix for PMV/PPD calculation. What you need to do is just converting
those codes into a tool that is convenient for yourself, like VB in Excel.
Of course few inputs are needed to run the computer codes, such as mean
radiant temperature which can be obtained from an empirical formula as a
function of air dry-bulb temperature, surrounding wall surface temperatures,
and air movement speed, if I remember correctly.

Dear all,

I have three different basic questions:

1 - I have been trying to draw holes on floors where the stairs are placed
in my geometrical model. But the program does not allow me to draw them on
the exact place of the stairs.

2 - I can?t convert some outline blocks into building blocks, as the
message: failed, appears.

3 - Is there any specific way of drawing chimneys?


Thank you very much for your help

Hi

I assume that you are using Designbuilder from your question. There is 
an online help forum devoted to this software at www.designbuilder.co.uk.
Comments inline.
Remember, it is important to get you're model thermally right and reduce 
the number of facets/ surfaces as much as possible.
If you are trying to create complicated geometries then I've found thin 
block walls are better.

Regards

Chris

Thermally speaking, as long as the hole is of the same size and couples 
the same spaces then its shape is not as important. If you're using DB 
to export to Radiance for lighting analysis then obviously that's a 
different matter.

If you've done certain boolean (union, subtract, intersection) modelling 
operations sometimes this error occurs. It is usually indicative that 
the geometry is a bit too complicated.
> 3 - Is there any specific way of drawing chimneys?
Again, thermally speaking, what is the significance of the chimney? If 
it is to take part in an Airflownetwork then there are probably 
expedient ways to simplify it. If not, then you may be able to leave it 
out of the model completely.

Message-ID: <5ED680899DECBE4681C13CD1CDFC24981D86C9259F@THES8CLU02.mmm.ca>

Hi All,

I am working on a project that pretains renevations and addition for an exisitng building. The existing is about 60% of the total new designed building, and new constructed addition is about 40%.
The existing section will have an upgraded walls and roof. Windows will remain the same. The new section will comply with local codes.

For (LEED NC v1) modeling purposes, can I model the entire building as one building (existing and new addition)? and Once modeled, Do I compare energy reduction against New Building or Exisitng in LEED reference?

Any assistance is greatly appreciated!

Regards,
Maurice

	software
Message-ID: <769DAF35BDD8B047999F7D767378B8FF664087B156@HUBBUB.veic.org>

I'm interested in running simulations of particular HVAC measures without developing a full building model.

I'm new to building simulation software, but have some basic background with eQuest.

Generally we need to analyze specific measures (e.g. demand control ventilation, efficient chillers, heat pumps, etc), where it is a retrofit situation and we already have a fairly good sense of the load we need to meet.

Is there a way to set an arbitrary load within eQuest or comparable modeling package without creating a building load or, even better, has  anyone created stand alone modules that can accomplish these kinds of analyses?

Many thanks in advance, Greg

There are some equations to calculate them. The psychrometric chart does not help lot. I used to calculate PMV/PPD with my own VB 6. But there are a few important PMV/PPD equations behind the VB6.0 from some references that I forgot.

 

There is nothing to do with climate consultants, BTW.

For LEED 3.0 (2009) the wording is ?Upload supporting documentation with PMV/PPD calculation, ASHRAE comfort tool results, and/or psychrometric comfort zone chart from Standard 55?

For LEED 2.2 you just had to provide a narrative, but 3.0 requires the actual results from the calculations.  I may just have to buy ASHRAE?s ?Thermal Comfort Tool?, I was just hoping there was something else available.

I would be interested to see if anyone has actually done a calculation for this.  It?s been a while since submitting this credit, but if I remember correctly, the only requirement from LEED was a narrative from the engineer.

I'm running into an issue with Batch Processing and I was wondering if anyone could help. The basic question is:

Can you use Batch Processing in eQuest to modify a project that is in the Detailed Interface? Or
Can you use Batch Processing in eQuest to modify a project's BDL?

I downloaded the excel templates from the DOE2 website and was able to use Batch Processing to modify different aspects of an eQuest model that was still in the DD Wizard. From the templates, it appears that modifying the BDL directly is possible. However, I have been unable to accomplish it. I've attached the two spreadsheets that illustrate what currently isn't working. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks in advanced.

Just speaking from one of my previous projects with a large warehouse component:


-          The warehouse was required by the LEED reviewers to be heated and cooled

-          I could not just simulate ventilation energy in the proposed case

-          I tried presenting my case and showing the effects of conditioning/not conditioning a few variations of proposed and baseline, but had to go to an appeal to finish EA c1 because the review team appeared to change their request during the re-submittal

-          It may have been mentioned before, but if I would have known about it from the beginning I would have saved a lot of time/frustration: CIR!

Don?t shoot me for not remembering where it is, but basically it allowed me (and the previous CIR recipient) to move the TSTAT set-points in the warehouse so far out that both heating and cooling would never come on, thus simulating ventilation-only energy. Seems like a sneaky work-around, but by doing this in both models it?s treated as an allowable measure.

Not sure if this helps out in terms of trying to prove the minimum required energy cost savings in any other facility though.

The warehouse I am looking at is a rectangular building, just under 1.5 million sf and with a ceiling height of 41 ft.  Maximum occupancy is 50 people mostly in 12,000 sf of administrative offices with 10 ft ceiling. Why maintain the entire mass of air occupying the space volume in the warehouse at 75 deg F in summer and 70 deg F in winter?  Can the proposed warehouse model use just ventilation and save energy.  The percent energy savings for LEED certification is enormous.  Mechanical floors are heated (to prevent pipe freezing) and ventilated.  Underground parking is ventilated.  Does ASHRAE Std90 for commercial buildings include industrial buildings (steel plants)?  The definition only mentions area and number floors.  I might have got it wrong.  I have only worked on commercial that house people.

I believe it is a fairly simple process to set up a schematic design model
in eQuest.

By choosing the schematic design process many of the inputs are set to
default, which in eQuest's case are quite good and generally make sense.
This is the route I would take especially considering the ease with which
eQuest can perform parametric modeling.

Matthew,
 
Besides the responses to my message sent to Bldg-Sim, I received two other responses that said the same thing, that during building operation ?to move the TSTAT set-points in the warehouse so far out that both heating and cooling would never come on, thus simulating ventilation-only energy?.  The baseline system for this building would be 7 (Fan Control: Packaged rooftop variable air volume with reheat; Cooling Type: Chilled Water; Heating Type: Hot Water Fossil Fuel Boiler) that provides heating and cooling so the proposed system must do the same. Changing the system to roof top packaged VAVS with gas furnace heating and DX cooling produced a slightly lower Kbtu/sf/yr but the first and maintenance costs and space requirements would be lower.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED new construction and major renovations

 

Hi All,

 

I am working on a project that pretains renevations and addition for an
exisitng building. The existing is about 60% of the total new designed
building, and new constructed addition is about 40%.

The existing section will have an upgraded walls and roof. Windows will
remain the same. The new section will comply with local codes.

 

For (LEED NC v1) modeling purposes, can I model the entire building as one
building (existing and new addition)? and Once modeled, Do I compare energy
reduction against New Building or Exisitng in LEED reference?

 

Any assistance is greatly appreciated!

 

Regards,

Maurice

Dear Maurice,

For your information below is the CIR related to this, please use the
formula to calculate the target percent.

*9/14/2007 - Credit Interpretation Request*
The purpose of this CIR is to obtain confirmation of what is considered New
Buildings vs. Existing Building Renovations within Option 1 of this credit.
The project consists of a 120,000 SF existing building, which is part of and
connected to other buildings in a corporate campus. The building was
recently used for offices, which is the predominate use of the campus. There
is no central mechanical plant for the campus-each building has its own
mechanical system. The building is being converted to a large data center.
The building's exterior shell will be retained but the existing mechanical
and electrical systems, as well as all interior partitions, ceilings and
finishes, will be removed. In short, the building is being gutted. We will
be submitting this credit under Option 1: Whole Building Energy Simulation.
The mechanical engineer is confident that the building will save at least 7%
energy costs but not sure it will achieve 14%. Since we are required to
achieve 2 points in this credit to achieve certification, we wish to be
certain that the project will be considered Existing Building Renovation for
the purpose of awarding points for energy savings.
*10/24/2007 - Ruling*
Because the existing building shell is preserved, this project can apply for
EAc1 using the Existing Building Renovations energy cost savings thresholds.
Please note that if there are portions of the project that will be
new construction, then use the equation provided in the LEED-NC v2.1 CIR
Ruling dated 9/5/2001 (and revised on 9/21/06) to determine the appropriate
point-thresholds. The equation follows below: To calculate the optimization
point table for a project that has both existing and new construction, use
the following formula for each line of the table:
*target percent = (existing SF / total SF) * (existing percent) + (new SF /
total SF) * (new percent)*

Hi Amelia,

1. You cannot draw 'doughnut' shaped surfaces in EnergyPlus, so if you need
to draw a hole in a slab, just split the slab into two surfaces either side
of the hole.

Paul

Dear All,

 

I'd like to invite everyone to participate in the SimBuild 2010 Energy
Analysis Competition. The deadline for requesting clarifications has passed,
but those still wishing to participate in the competition may do so. The
competition is a great way to differentiate your firm (or yourself if you
are in the job market) with some third party recognition. There is also a
$1000 cash prize for the top professional team and $500 cash prize for the
top student team.

 

Competition information, including additional information based on submitted
requests for clarification, is available on the competition website
(http://ibpsa.us/simbuild2010/competition.shtml).

 

ANNOUNCEMENT: Due to the delay in posting responses, the deadline has been
extended to July 15th. 

 

Please read the instructions carefully and bear in mind the scope and intent
of the analysis when working on your submittal.

 

Good luck to all and we look forward to your submittals,

 

Mike Karpman

Competition Chair

Hello All,

I am trying to model an addition to an existing building. The addition has
a  separate air handling units but is served by the boiler and chiller
plants of the existing portions of the building. I have understood that I
would have to model the whole building including the existing portions
according to Appendix G. But, while comparing the energy savings, would I
have to include energy consumption of the existing portions or just the
addition?

Thank you.

Hi all,

 

I'm looking for 8760 weather data for Bermuda to import into Trace. I've
checked the doe2.com, IWEC, and EnergyPlus weather data and none of them
have data for Bermuda. Does anyone know where else I might look for 8760
files or a decent guide to describe how to get this information from
NREL/NCDC data?

 

I think my next best option is to get it from a program called Meteonorm
that generates a TMY file from measured data. Does anyone have any
experience with this program?

 

Thanks,

Jeff

Hi all,
I am currently trying to assess perception of thermal environment of semi-external spaces. I have in mind a couple of DTM tools that could work, but I would really appreciate any suggestion. A tool that can also take into account the solar component on the operative temperature calculation would be quite useful.
Thanks a lot,

The emphasis will be on using building, CFD, and daylight simulation tools to help inform design, as well as document performance compared to accepted standards.   The Analyst will also work to educate clients, architects and engineers on new technologies and innovative solutions.  There will be opportunity to work with design engineers and develop better understanding and knowledge of the MEP consulting field. Our sustainable practice is growing and will provide you an opportunity to grow with it.

The candidate should be an HVAC/Mechanical/Architectural/Energy Engineer and/or Energy Modeler with 1+ years of relevant experience using building simulation tools. Degree required. The candidate will have strong knowledge of EnergyPlus, DOE-2, eQuest, TRNSYS or TRACE.  Experience with CFD or daylight modeling would be beneficial.   Experience with HVAC systems and/or HVAC controls is ideal.  AutoCAD and Sketchup fluency a plus. The candidate should have excellent abilities with MS Excel; familiarity with VBA is a plus.   Experience with other programming languages is also a plus.  Candidate should be a creative thinker with effective communication and teamwork skills.   The person would ideally be environmentally minded with an understanding of energy and climate change issues.

The Madison office maintains its own projects and also provides sustainable design assistance to its other offices.  Madison is a highly praised city with an excellent quality of life.  The downtown area is situated between two large, beautiful lakes, and the University of Wisconsin and State Capitol provide countless opportunities for cultural, social, and educational activities.

Like all DOE-2 based programs, EE4 is limited to 1 system serving a zone. 
That said, what you are describing sounds like a packaged VAV system with
zonal heating and/or reheat.  The issue seems to be the "main system"
which sounds like a make-up air unit which you would have to work into the
PVAV for fan energy and heat recovery (if applicable).

Harris,

I would suggest any of the following:

IES, DesignBuilder, Bentley TAS, IDA ICE, ESPr all of which should be able
to do this or something very similar.

I would look at potentially using DesignBuilder (or IES) with the CFD
results being coupled to the DTM results.  That way you could look at local
level air comfort and operative temperature values (this is definitely in
DesignBuilder) for say peak conditions in the CFD model based on the DTM
results and get a visual output showing where hot areas were, etc.  A lot
easier to describe what is going on with images.

Regards
Paul

Hi all,
I am currently trying to assess perception of thermal environment of
semi-external spaces. I have in mind a couple of DTM tools that could work,
but I would really appreciate any suggestion. A tool that can also take into
account the solar component on the operative temperature calculation would
be quite useful.
Thanks a lot,

Message-ID: <AANLkTilO9pScSr3DqtZE2_tYQpvqiHef4PfmbYGr4EW_@mail.gmail.com>

A School with plant already existing, a small addition is made to the
existing school (not separate, more like an extension). The addition has
separate space supply equipments (downstream), but acquires energy from the
existing plant (upstream). And, the addition is the only portion going for
LEED accreditation. I have gotten to know that I would have to build the
whole building for energy model.

Does this situation coincide with the DES (District Energy System) scenario?

Any help would be great.

Thank you.

RetScreen may have it, but I am not sure. Since it is freely available, it's worth checking.

Hi all,

I'm looking for 8760 weather data for Bermuda to import into Trace. I've checked the doe2.com, IWEC, and EnergyPlus weather data and none of them have data for Bermuda. Does anyone know where else I might look for 8760 files or a decent guide to describe how to get this information from NREL/NCDC data?

I think my next best option is to get it from a program called Meteonorm that generates a TMY file from measured data. Does anyone have any experience with this program?

Thanks,
Jeff

RETScreen does have weather data for "everywhere" -- but it is monthly not
hourly.

I did generate hourly weather data for Bermuda forever ago (in 1999!) but
have since left that organization and do not have access to it.  I ended
up using data from the Bda national weather service and then filling in
the holes.

I think RET Screen has a solar air heating module.

Not sure if Norm Weaver is still active on this list, but I think he was working on creating an analysis tool for Solar Wall.

RETScreen definitely has a solar wall module.

There is also the SWIFT solar wall modelling software available here:

Good luck -- have had pretty good success on a couple of solar wall projects.

Fred,
  There is a transpired solar wall component in TRNSYS as well. It was 
developed by Greg BARKER for NREL. I've used it in a number of projects 
and had good luck with it. I am not entirely sure what its availability 
is but I can check for you and find out.
Best,
  David

Hi,

I'm working with Energy Plus modeling of a zero energy house which 
incorporates a ground source heat pump (GSHP) with horizontal heat 
exchangers.

However, I cannot find any instance of such a system defined as an Energy Plus model. Examples that I found are all based on vertical bore holes.
Has anyone have experience with Energy Plus modeling of GSHP with horizontal HXs.
Thanks.

Hi there!

 

I am not an Energy Plus user at all, but you may be interested to know
of a free program:  GS2000
<http://canmetenergy-canmetenergie.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca/eng/software_tools/
gs2000.html> 

 

This is a simple, small program developed by the Canadians that I rely
on to both size and model Ground loop heat exchangers (GLHX).  It's not
as fully featured or user-friendly as I expect some of the for-cost
software packages are out there, but very functional for what it does
cover.  The included help files are surprisingly helpful, by the way.
The basic procedure I use in eQuest is to determine the annual
temperature behavior of the GLHX using a periphery program like GS2000,
then to model a simple lake/well-type GLHX with a custom annual
temperature schedule to match the actual behavior of the GLHX.  

 

If nothing else, it's a handy little tool to know about for design/model
verification purposes =).  Here is a screengrab showing that a series of
horizontal GLHX sub-types are worked into the program for input:

Apologies for the size of the attachment.

I'm looking for weather data for Beijing, and I see three weather files on the Energy plus site.

The first one is the CSWD (Chinese Standard Weather Data) source.
The second is the CTYW (Chinese Typical Year Weather) source
And the last is the SWERA (Solar & Wind Resource Assessment).

It seems like the first one has very strange solar radiation data - strange spikes that really look wrong. It also seems like the humidity numbers are too high - pretty much 100% most of the year.

The last two look more reasonable and are pretty similar (which would indicate that they are more reliable). However - they both show really low direct solar in the summer months (less than diffuse).

Has anyone had any experience with this? Which one should I use?

I hope the attachment goes through.  It contains Beijing.bin (146 kb bin file converted from NCDC data year 2000) and Beijing.bin converted to Excel tables and charts (1.0 mb).  It includes only 5% of the original 17 mb Excel tables and charts (6 mb zipped) in pdf.

	- skylights
Message-ID: <64465012B48B484383D6BD4F6BD8643503146ECD@allkex02.NIRAS.INT>

Dear recipients,

 

Starting to read ASHRAE 90.1 with focus on skylights, I'm not sure that I read the standard correctly. Can anyone here help?

 

I'm reading ASHRAE 90.1 -2007 (SI Edition) and am looking for the building envelope requirements for Climatic Zone 5. As I read table 5.5.5 (assuming a nonresidential building), the skylight can have a U-value (of the assembly) up to 6.64 assuming it is made of glass However this doesn't give any meaning - since a U-value that high is almost equivalent to the surface resistance factors (and nothing from the glazing/gases etc.).

 

What U-value should I use for the skylights in the budget-building - assuming the building to be constructed in climatic zone 5?

Vikram,

I like your plots, but I have one suggestion - you should plot the total 
and diffuse radiation as solid shades and the direct normal as the solid 
line, since diffuse is always a subset of the total horizontal, while 
the direct normal can be higher than either of the other two because of 
the sun angles.

I helped in the creation of the CTYWs back about 14 years ago, and am
aware of the CSWD and SWERA efforts, but have not compared the three 
sets in detail. I agree with you that the solar and humidity on the CSWD 
look suspicious. Do the 3-4 months showing only a single temperature 
line indicate that the wetbulb is identical with the drybulb, i.e., that 
RH is at 100% for the whole month? That's hard to believe. Likewise, the 
spikes in direct normal solar are no doubt a problem with the algorithm 
used to distribute the measured daily to the hourly solar values.

The SWERA and CTYW both use similar raw data originally from the US 
Climate Data Center. In both files, the solar is estimated using various 
radiation models based on cloud cover and other climate parameters. When 
"tuned" to measured data, these models have been found to be pretty 
accurate on the aggregate, i.e., monthly or annual means, level, but can 
be considerably off for any particular hour or day.

Thanks Joe - this is good input. I didn't realize that you worked on this.



You're right - it does mean 100% humidity - which I think looks wrong.



Heres a view of the entire year from the CSWD file plotted over the entire year. That looks completely wrong to me. I think I'll stick with the CTYW or the SWERA.

I was asked what influences an engineers decision over design conditions,
and after looking for some textural support in the books, i could not find
anything to give guidance over when to use 0.4/1/2 or 99/99.6 % design
conditions.  Does anyone know if this text exists in the ASHRAE books and if
so which chapter?  I also looked into ASHRAE 90.1, but that only addresses
efficiencies of equipment and not the design conditions/capacity
calculations.

Thanks in advance,

Rob,

 

I have never read specific conditions of when to use one over the other
however typically the conditions used are dictated by the type of
building. In my experience buildings with low tolerances for temperature
change use the 99.6%/0.4%. These buildings would include hospitals,
laboratories, R&D etc. Buildings with a high level of tolerance will use
99%/1%. These buildings are typically office buildings, higher
education, retail etc.

 

In the past six months I have seen a huge change in design conditions.
The latest owner has specified design conditions of ASHRAE 99%/1% with
Summer indoor of 78 deg F/50%RH and Winter indoor of 68 deg F. However,
they want the thermostat set point to be 73 deg F year round.

I was asked what influences an engineers decision over design
conditions, and after looking for some textural support in the books, i
could not find anything to give guidance over when to use 0.4/1/2 or
99/99.6 % design conditions.  Does anyone know if this text exists in
the ASHRAE books and if so which chapter?  I also looked into ASHRAE
90.1, but that only addresses efficiencies of equipment and not the
design conditions/capacity calculations.

Thanks in advance,

My original response to the question was it was designers preference.  This
seems to be not entirely wrong, as it could be clients preference or space
use that has some influence on the designers choice of design conditions.
Thanks for you input.

I can confirm: I learned during and after schooling that the choice to
use any set of columns is the designers' preference.  Some designers
will flip between based on elements of the project at hand, and others
will always stick to one set of columns based on their personal
tolerance/perception of the stringency of each set of conditions.

 

I don't know if ASHRAE intended this, but personally I always use the
most stringent figures as a rule when sizing up equipment.  My reasoning
is I'm a young designer who hasn't fully grasped where less conservative
criteria are acceptable, and I choose to control the potential for
oversizing via final "rule-of-thumb" / comparative design checks and the
occasional investigative energy model.

Dear Bldg-Sim folk,

 

I think that overdesigning / oversizing is rampant in the engineering
community.  Largely, this is a response to concerns about litigation or
worries about non-technical clients who don't know how they'll use a
facility.  VSD- equipped fans and pumps go a long way toward reducing the
energy penalty associated with oversized systems, but it can still be
severe.

 

I think I've read recently that many systems are 50% larger than actually
required.  This, of course, means that duct, pipe, and water, gas and
electrical service are also oversized and more costly than needed (not to
mention the equipment itself).  I recently reviewed some load calculations
where the designer used ~5W / sq.ft. for internal loads in an office space
that was pursuing LEED certification.  The same space required ~1W / sq.f.t
for lighting in order to meet the ASHRAE 90.1 requirements and had normal
plug loads, all of which probably didn't add up to anything near 5W/sq.ft.
On top of that, the zone HVAC equipment was heat pumps, so I have serious
doubts about the quality of humidity control for oversized DX equipment.

 

Doing the math shows that 1% of the summer hours is , well, 1%!  99% of the
time, loads will be met; that's a lot! In addition, the 1% hours do not
occur all at once; the HVAC has a chance to catch up at night.  They don't
occur at the beginning of the day, either. Comfort is maintained for the
bulk of the day in most cases and the "unmet loads" may even occur after
most occupants have gone home due to the normal thermal lag.

 

Early in my career, I UNDER-sized a heating system in the Midwest and
learned that I was TOO close to the capacity line,  Since then, my
philosophy has been somewhere between "Make sure capacity is plenty, with
good part load performance" and "Act like an engineer and believe your own
calculations (without padding them)!"  Lately, I'm leaning more toward the
second one.

Hello All,

Just to clarify a point -

What does the oversizing of capacities by 15% for cooling and 25% for
heating exactly mean? Do we only size the cooling and heating capacity or
also increase the airflow rate corresponding to the oversizing?

Thank you.

Dear Vinay,

 

I'm not sure of the rationale for the ASHRAE 90.1 oversizing requirements,
however here are my thoughts:

.         I think the principal engineering rationale for oversizing is to
allow a building to reach its setpoint temperature quickly after a period of
inactivity.  As an example, if a building is inactive during a holiday and
the temperature is allowed to float several degrees lower (in winter), the
additional 25% heating capacity will enable faster return to the normal
setpoint temperature.  Steam heating systems can need even more capacity for
proper warmup capacity.

.         Oversizing is also a common practice as a "safety factor".  Most
load calculation software even has a separate input for adding this "safety
factor".

Hello All,

Just to clarify a point - 

What does the oversizing of capacities by 15% for cooling and 25% for
heating exactly mean? Do we only size the cooling and heating capacity or
also increase the airflow rate corresponding to the oversizing?

Thank you.

Vinay,

 

You are to increase the cooling/heating coil capacities as required by
ASHRAE Appendix G. However, the over sizing is for coil capacity only -
the airflow rate should be sized at 100% of what your energy modeling
program calculates as being required to meet the space load.

 

Thanks

So does that mean, for an all air system, off-coil temperature is 
actually lower in cooling and higher in heating for the startup period?

Mr. Dirkes and Mr. Spangler,

Thank you so much for both of your inputs on this. I am clear with the
concept of oversizing and also what Appendix G says.

Thanks again!

It has CA defaults, but does that matter?

Others are Trace, HAP.

Mike,

It depends on what you are trying to accomplish. If you need LEED or 
Ashrae 90.1 analysis then DOE, Equest and E+ seem to be the only ones 
that handle the waterside hvac in the prescribed manner. They are all free.

TAS now has an A90.1 tool. It looks easy to use but as I haven't used it 
I can't speak authoritativley.

I heard of users modelling for A90.1 with alternative tools whilst 
handling the waterside with seperate calculations. Of these tools IES is 
probably the easiest and fastest simulating. If you do not require code 
compliance I would probably recommend IES as the commercial option for 
large buildings.

I hope that this helps.

Chris

Howdy!

Has anyone modeled a green roof? I have a standard roof with 12 inches of soil and grass. I have been searching the web for thermal properties such as U values, thermal absorptivity and so on. Are there any good references to find these values or does anyone have tips to model a green roof? I appreciate your help.

I heard from our director of sustainability to use R-5 for a typical
green roof. It was confirmed by few senior architects.

 

Thanks,

Howdy! 

 

Has anyone modeled a green roof? I have a standard roof with 12 inches
of soil and grass. I have been searching the web for thermal properties
such as U values, thermal absorptivity and so on. Are there any good
references to find these values or does anyone have tips to model a
green roof? I appreciate your help.

Penn State University (http://horticulture.psu.edu/cms/greenroofcenter/)
and Michigan State University (http://www.hrt.msu.edu/greenroof/) both
have significant research programs on green roofs.  I would recommend
looking at the results of the Penn State study on energy transfer in
Green Roofs (
http://etda.libraries.psu.edu/theses/approved/WorldWideFiles/ETD-4616/Th
esis_Paulo_Tabares_revised.pdf).  In general, green roofs handle energy
through the insulating effects of soil, the cooling effects of
evapotranspiration in the plants, and water flows within the green roof
assembly.  This means that a calculated R-value will be different
depending on the amount of plant material participating in
evapotranspiration, the wetness of the soil, and whether the roof is
intensive or extensive.  A straight R-value approach is very simplified
and should be used with the understanding that model results are much
less likely to be accurate.  The Penn State study gives a review of
published literature showing extensive green roofs have R-values between
1.8 and 4.8 while intensive green roofs have R-values between 5 and 20.

 

In general, the average R-value of soil is 0.25 per inch, so for a 12"
soil depth the R-value of the soil would be R-3 excluding assumptions on
soil wetness and evapotranspiration.  We typically go conservative and
just model the R-value of the additional soil since you would need a
TRNSYS or MatLab model to take into account the other energy benefits of
a green roof.

Open question:

 

I've ascribed to the "tack an R / thermal mass value onto a new  layer"
approach in the past... but would appreciate a more nuanced approach if
it could be done quickly enough.

 

I'm curious:  Does EnergyPlus or any other option/model out there
account the variable shading effects of the foliage on the roof
construction, as a user might define it?  I've speculated this element
could be handled relatively simply in eQuest using a geometrically
adjacent shading surface with an annual fractional schedule, but eQuest
(to my experience) doesn't have a clean approach to account for the
varying thermal mass and insulative properties of soil that varies in
moisture over time...

Message-ID: <005701cb1492$7fdf4330$7f9dc990$@net>

Dear Bldg-Sim community,

 

I've just completed a lovely, accurate, comprehensive building energy model
(in Energy Plus) which contains an indoor swimming pool.  The building is
about 100,000 square feet and the pool area is about 10% of that total.

 

At the end of the year, the heating, cooling, fans and pumps associated with
the pool have consumed 70% of the total building energy!  I was rather
surprised.  I expected it to be a large percentage, but not THAT large!
This, by the way, is the result when using a specialty pool HVAC unit which
recovers and re-uses most of the DX cooling energy and thus greatly reduces
the pool energy total.

 

As far as I can tell, ALL of the pool-related energy is considered by ASHRAE
90.1 and LEED to be "process" energy.  Since "process" energy must be
identical in both the baseline and proposed models, the rest of the building
must accomplish the entire savings . which is pretty darn difficult
(impossible, really) if "process" is too large a percentage.

 

Have any of you successfully modeled a building with a pool and also
received LEED certification?  If so, can you suggest what I might be
missing?

 

Thanks in advance.

James,

There are CIRs related to this for NC v2.2 (if you are using v3 you might have to submit your own CIR). Look up the following ruling dates; 2/26/2008, 5/27/2008, and 2/3/2009. The gist of it is that the baseline system serving the pool has to be the same type and have the same controls but you can account for mechanical system energy savings via an exceptional calculation method assuming that you can prove that the proposed design goes beyond what is typically done for the application. In the project that I worked with pool units, I had both sensible energy recovery and hot gas bypass as exceptional calculation method energy savings.

Good luck,

Alex Chapin

James,

I don't think I agree with you that all swimming pool related energy is a process load according to 90.1. The definition in 90.1 is as follows:

process energy: energy consumed in support of a manufacturing, industrial, or commercial process other than conditioning spaces and maintaining comfort and amenities for the occupants of a building.

Clearly controlling space and pool water temperature in a natatorium maintains comfort for the occupants of a building. Additionally, 90.1 specifically includes many swimming pool related requirements including;


*         Section 7.4.5.1 - pool heaters

*         Section 7.4.5.2 - pool covers

*         Section 7.4.5.3 - time switches

*         Table 7.8 - pool heater efficiency requirements

*         Section 6.5.6.1 - Exhaust Air Energy Recovery (does not specifically mention swimming pools, but should apply).

I guess that the crucial assumption is whether all the dehumidification,
reheat ,etc. is "maintaining comfort".  Initially, I thought that because it
was far more than "just" comfort, it had to be considered process.  Maybe I
was wrong. For my client's sake, I hope so!

 

Thanks to several of you who have responded!

Mike,

It depends on what you are trying to accomplish. If you need LEED or Ashrae 90.1 analysis then DOE, Equest and E+ seem to be the only ones that handle the waterside hvac in the prescribed manner. They are all free.

TAS now has an A90.1 tool. It looks easy to use but as I haven't used it I can't speak authoritativley.

I heard of users modelling for A90.1 with alternative tools whilst handling the waterside with seperate calculations. Of these tools IES is probably the easiest and fastest simulating. If you do not require code compliance I would probably recommend IES as the commercial option for large buildings.

I hope that this helps.

Hi,

What software do you suggest for Modeling Commercial buildings?

I live in Michigan work for a company doing energy audits from 5000-120000 square feet.

Energy Plus -over my head
equest-CA defaults
DOE 2.1 or DOE 2.2 ?

Would like a free option and one that I have to buy?
Thank you

No. This is a function of the flow, not the capacity.

So does that mean, for an all air system, off-coil temperature is
actually lower in cooling and higher in heating for the startup period?

Vinay,

 

You are to increase the cooling/heating coil capacities as required by
ASHRAE Appendix G. However, the over sizing is for coil capacity only -
the airflow rate should be sized at 100% of what your energy modeling

Dear Vinay,

 

I'm not sure of the rationale for the ASHRAE 90.1 oversizing
requirements, however here are my thoughts:

I think the principal engineering rationale for oversizing is to allow a
building to reach its setpoint temperature quickly after a period of
inactivity.  As an example, if a building is inactive during a holiday
and the temperature is allowed to float several degrees lower (in
winter), the additional 25% heating capacity will enable faster return
to the normal setpoint temperature.  Steam heating systems can need even
more capacity for proper warmup capacity.

Oversizing is also a common practice as a "safety factor".  Most load
calculation software even has a separate input for adding this "safety
factor".

Hello All,

Just to clarify a point - 

What does the oversizing of capacities by 15% for cooling and 25% for
heating exactly mean? Do we only size the cooling and heating capacity
or also increase the airflow rate corresponding to the oversizing?

Thank you.

Generally, match the HVAC zoning when that's known (typical in my LEED
projects), combining the zones where they are significantly similar in
system type and internal/external loads/surfaces.  When you don't know
the HVAC zoning, 90.1 allows for simplified "perimeter/core" zoning with
some common-sense restrictions.  As Bill suggested, 90.1 user's manual
spells out both approaches with brevity.

 

Alternatively, you might read the entry "Zones for Buildings Without
HVAC Systems" in the DOE-2 help files that came with your eQuest
installation.

Mike,

It depends on what you are trying to accomplish. If you need LEED or Ashrae 90.1 analysis then DOE, Equest and E+ seem to be the only ones that handle the waterside hvac in the prescribed manner. They are all free.

TAS now has an A90.1 tool. It looks easy to use but as I haven't used it I can't speak authoritativley.

I heard of users modelling for A90.1 with alternative tools whilst handling the waterside with seperate calculations. Of these tools IES is probably the easiest and fastest simulating. If you do not require code compliance I would probably recommend IES as the commercial option for large buildings.

I hope that this helps.

90.1 analysis then DOE, Equest and E+ seem to be the only ones that handle the
waterside hvac in the prescribed manner. They are all free.



TAS now has an A90.1 tool. It looks easy to use but as I haven't used it I
can't speak authoritativley.



I heard of users modelling for A90.1 with alternative tools whilst handling the
waterside with seperate calculations. Of these tools IES is probably the
easiest and fastest simulating. If you do not require code compliance I would
probably recommend IES as the commercial option for large buildings.



I hope that this helps.



Chris

All:

 

If anyone is curious as to whether program X or Y is better for a specific modeling conundrum ? here [bldg-sim] is a great place to ask, and that?s probably the most advise-able approach over relying on any dated list, for reasons that follow.

 

Any such ?YES/NO? formatted list is inherently going to misrepresent features available between different software tools.  MANY items require more than a one word response to fairly represent the programs? comparative capabilities.

 

Here are some black & white corrections regarding only eQuest, which I?m most familiar with.  THIS IS NOT AN EXHAUSTIVE REVIEW, but should prove the point that such lists are bound to be misleading:

 

?         Load Design Calculation:  No ? Yes, based on other line items in the list, I assume this means ?produces loads that can be used for design purposes.?

?         Max Zones:  1024  ?  4000

?         Accepts CAD input files/gbXML:  Yes ? Strictly yes to both, but people would be misled to believe importing gbXML is a time-efficient idea in eQuest? (some purportedly have had more luck)

?         User Modeling Guide: *blank* ? Available online at doe2 website: http://www.doe2.com/equest/

?         Telephone and Email Help:  $450/10 hrs ? Huh?  How about free to anyone subscribing at the onebuilding.org lists -  that applies to any of these software tools by the way?  If there?s an official hotline available, I?m unaware of it ? does this correspond to someone?s training class?

?         Max Number of Lighting & Equipment Loads per Zone: 5 ? Seems misleading? Up to 5 distinct Lighting and 5 distinct equipment loads, with distinct scheduling for each may be defined for each zone? 

?         The following items are left blank in the table but are explicitly or indirectly model-able within eQuest, sometimes with restrictions:

o   Demand control ventilation

o   Energy (heat) Recovery (various options)

o   Chilled beam systems (limited)

o   Displacement ventilation design can be accounted for, but eQuest does not perform CFD

o   Active dehumidification of various flavors can be modeled on airside systems.

?         ?Chilled? & ?Condenser water reset? are left blank? reset temp controls can be defined for hot, chilled and condenser loops if that?s what we?re getting at?

 

I?ve decided not to discuss which items I think are completely arbitrary/useless in a comparison - the reader should probably decide or else hire someone qualified to decide for them =).  Any finite list of items selected (certainly one this short) will inevitably appear to favor one program over another, so I?m also choosing to not discuss what?s missing on the list.

 

Disclaimer:  Our office actively uses Trace, HAP and eQuest among other software tools ? I have no vested interests (financial or otherwise) in any of the respective developers?  The only agenda I am pushing for is constructive/fair comparisons where they happen, and I?m doing so on my own time.  On a related note, I am also personally disappointed when discussions like this occur and individuals rely on their email headers to explain who they represent.

BLDG-SIM readers should be aware the PDF attached to the previous e-mail contains outdated and factually incorrect information for at least one of the software tools listed.

 

When a document like this is posted by a software vendor, it should only include data for that vendor?s own tool.  It should omit all other data since a software vendor cannot vouch for the accuracy of information about features and capabilities of competitor?s tools.

Hello All,

I'd like to know what interface software packages you all are using out there (if any).

Jim,

Please update this list for HAP. The original version of this list created by Marlin Addison was posted a few months ago (March) and engineers asked us (Trane CDS) if some of the information on TRACE was accurate. Obviously it was out of date so we updated only the TRACE information and even forwarded it to you, Jim, recommending you update the HAP information. I should think 3 months is more than enough time to update this list.

Yes, also, the eQuest information should be updated too. Now that this is on the Bldg-sim list it is in the public domain and should be treated as such; free to be updated by anyone. The DOE-II information should be up to date as it's no longer under active development.

Let the facts speak for themselves. Let's share the capabilities and information that exist today and let the modeling community decide. That is more than fair and honest. My previous email also suggested adding IES and TRNSYS to this list. Energy Plus may be a good addition also.
