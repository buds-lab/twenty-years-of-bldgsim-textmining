Hello all

I am a LEED AP in Argentina in the city of Buenos Aires with architectural background. I am entering into to the building simulation world as part of the services my firm offers to clients. I am pleased to be part of this group, the level of the topics presented help me learn more about the software, the trends, the ideas.

Anyone in South America? I would like to get on touch of other members in the region for networking and eventually start something regional.

Many thanks and regards.

Dear Sachin,

Try these:

 

In the IDF:

Density, Timestep;

 

In an RVI file:

Name_dischargeNode, System Node Volume Flow Rate Standard Density

 

In both cases "Name_dischargeNode" is the name that you are using for the
PTAC air outlet node.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Building Controls Virtual Test Bed 1.1 has been released
Message-ID: <001f01cce11b$b55a1c90$200e55b0$@gov>

We are pleased to announce the release of the Building Controls Virtual Test
Bed 1.1

 

The following changes have been made compared to version 1.0:

 

* The example files have been updated for EnergyPlus 7.0. 

 * An actor has been added that allows reading CSV files.

* The BCVTB has also been compiled for Windows 64 bit (in addition to
Windows 32 bit, Linux 32/64 bit and Mac OS X 64 bit).

 

The Building Controls Virtual Test Bed (BCVTB) is a freely available
open-source software environment that allows expert users to couple
different simulation programs for co-simulation, and to couple simulation
programs with actual hardware. For example, the BCVTB allows to simulate a
building in EnergyPlus and the HVAC and control system in Modelica, while
exchanging data between the software as they simulate. The BCVTB is based on
the Ptolemy II software environment. The BCVTB allows expert users of
simulation to expand the capabilities of individual programs by linking them
to other programs. Due to the different programs that may be involved in
distributed simulation, familiarity with configuring programs is essential.

 

Programs that are linked to the BCVTB are

 

* the EnergyPlus whole building energy simulation program,

* the Modelica modeling and simulation environment Dymola,

* the MATLAB and Simulink tools for scientific computing,

* the Radiance ray-tracing software for lighting analysis,

* the BACnet stack, which allows exchanging data with BACnet compliant
Building Automation System (BAS),

* the analog/digital interface USB-1208LS from Measurement Computing
Corporation that can be connected to a USB port. 

 

In addition to using programs that are coupled to Ptolemy II, Ptolemy II's
graphical modeling environment can also be used to define models for control
systems, for physical devices, for communication systems or for
post-processing and real-time visualization.

You might want to try the Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre, they probably have plenty on their database about this and certainly their numerical data for calculations book should have something in it.  Http://www.aivc.org/

Dear Deuk-Woo,



Here are a few comments on your questions:



1. To get energy efficiency incentives, such as LEED certificate.

2. To compare alternatives (wall material, window, building design) in architect point of view.

3. To compare alternatives (system type and configuration, COP, etc.) in mechanical engineer point of view.



For Items #1 - 3, EQUEST, EP+ or TRNSYS will do. In the U.S. EQUEST is the most widely used by the AE community. Note, for most of these simulations an hourly simulation will do, which is not a true dynamic simulation.



4. To develop energy efficient control strategies and to test DDC controllers. (BEMS and emulation; maybe electric engineering field or ??)



For this you'll need MATLAB and a true dynamic simulation platform (i.e., it usually needs 1 sec or less time steps and true dynamic equations). Many of the U.S. controls companies have developed extensive tools for this, including Modelica/Dymola platforms. However, they do not distribute these outside their own companies. MATLAB is fast becoming a platform of choice, perhaps because most universities teach with it. There are other platforms as well, check with your local ME or EE controls Prof. Some that come to mind are HVACSiM+ (by George Walton at NIST).



5. To identify the system mal-function (such as AHU) comparing between ?predicted? energy and ?actual? energy in real-time. (BEMS, maybe electric engineering field??)



This is a tough one. LBNL and PNNL have been working on this for some time. PNNL has their AHU fault detection program, and other programs. LBNL has their controls test bed up and running. You might also check with the Chair of ASHRAE TC 7.5 to see what the latest RPs for controls simulation. This TC has most of the knowledgable folks on it (which does not include me).



6. Building Simulator: which is used to training building managers or operators or learners (students) in HVAC system operation realistically (such as flight simulator)



Check out Joe Deringer's LEARNHVAC web page...just amazing...there is also other emulator work at LBNL that Phil Haves and Michael Wetter are doing.



7. To ?JUST? verify Building behavior (HVAC operation, energy consumption, etc) over the whole year period with different whether conditions in IWEC and TMY. (to see "what could be")



This can be done with forward models (i.e., simulation) or inverse models (i.e., ASHRAE RP1050), or a combination of both. You can also use component models such as those available from ASHRAe (HVAC01 and HVAC02 toolkit, RP865, RP827, etc).



There are other proprietary tools that diagnose HVAC problems, some have published results, some not. You'll find lots of papers (apx., 3 - 5,000) on our Lab's web site about our commissioning work, which includes air-side simulation as a diagnostic.



Hope this helps.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] the use of dynamic energy simulation tool

Dear all,

I have been thinking about the use of dynamic energy simulation tool (e.g. whole building simulation tool, such as E+, ESP-r, TRNSYS, SPARK, etc).

The usage area of the tool would be classified into two, academic area and practical area.

But I really want to hear your high-level opinion on the practical areas.

The typical usage of energy simulation program in practice could be listed as follows (as far as I know),


1.     To get energy efficiency incentives, such as LEED certificate.

2.     To compare alternatives (wall material, window, building design) in architect point of view.

3.     To compare alternatives (system type and configuration, COP, etc.) in mechanical engineer point of view.

4.     To develop energy efficient control strategies and to test DDC controllers. (BEMS and emulation; maybe electric engineering field or ??)

5.     To identify the system mal-function (such as AHU) comparing between ?predicted? energy and ?actual? energy in real-time. (BEMS, maybe electric engineering field??)

6.     Building Simulator: which is used to training building managers or operators or learners (students) in HVAC system operation realistically (such as flight simulator)

7.     To ?JUST? verify Building behavior (HVAC operation, energy consumption, etc) over the whole year period with different whether conditions in IWEC and TMY. (to see "what could be")

I think that the large portion of usage would be #1.

But, the problem have been arisen due to the uncertainties and ?too many? required input values of dynamic simulation tools.

As far as I know in South Korea, many people say ?these tools are not suited to assess building energy performance with acceptable speed. And there is no evidence it is helpful to achieve energy reduction actually. Something are missing. We (AEC) do not want to do full dynamic simulation. We just need a tool that is simple and faster and reliable?.

These days, the government is willing to move their direction which requires architects just to submit a building energy analysis report using simple ISO toolkit.
(many of my colleague agree to need of the normative performance method, ISO 13790 and DIN 18599.)

Now, in this situation, we have to rethink about the purpose of doing full dynamic energy simulation (E+, ESP-r, TRNSYS, etc) with practicality in mind.

I think that its usage would be more suitable for #4, #5, #6 rather than #1, #2, #3. Because #1,#2,#3 can be evaluated using ISO standards with acceptable speed and accuracy.
(but I do not know well about the usage in the fields of #4, #5, #6)

I?m waiting your comments on my thoughts.

p.s. this topic was discussed in E+ user group before, and the contents are slightly revised for better discussions.

Best Regards,
Deuk-Woo, Kim

Deuk-Woo

To add to Jeff's answer of point 4), Modelica models that allow dynamic
simulation of building energy and control systems are available from
http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica, including source code. These
models will run at sub-second time steps (when fast transients are present)
and can model realistic representations of control sequences.

The models can also be linked to hardware through BACnet and A/D converters
using the Building Controls Virtual Test Bed,
http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/bcvtb.

See the papers, manuals and user guides at these web sites for more
detailed information.

All the best,

Michael

Hi,

I think we constantly underestimate the impact on society of this field. Let?s take some pride in what we do!

Most of the wealth of developed nations is in the value of buildings. That value is starting to be related to the actual performance of those buildings. (Funny this hasn?t happened before.) We have venture capitalists calling and asking about the validation status of our tool. They want to know if they can trust the performance numbers quoted by someone selling a property. This would hardly have happened a few years back.

Suppose an engineering-proficient company, perhaps like Toyota, was challenged with the task of developing a high performance building. Do you think they would look for the latest ISO standardized monthly hand calculation method for its optimization? No, they would look for the best possible engineering tools available for describing and experimenting with dynamical virtual models of buildings. (Actually, they might not do so well first because they would probably underestimate the pure technical challenges involved).

Even a  big ship, such as the AEC industry, will turn eventually in response to the challenges ahead. At that stage, real knowledge and engineering skills are likely to be more important than committee designed hand calculation methods.

Cheers,

Per

Deuk-Woo

To add to Jeff's answer of point 4), Modelica models that allow dynamic simulation of building energy and control systems are available from http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica, including source code. These models will run at sub-second time steps (when fast transients are present) and can model realistic representations of control sequences.

The models can also be linked to hardware through BACnet and A/D converters using the Building Controls Virtual Test Bed, http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/bcvtb.

See the papers, manuals and user guides at these web sites for more detailed information.

All the best,

Michael

Dear Deuk-Woo,



Here are a few comments on your questions:



1. To get energy efficiency incentives, such as LEED certificate.

2. To compare alternatives (wall material, window, building design) in architect point of view.

3. To compare alternatives (system type and configuration, COP, etc.) in mechanical engineer point of view.



For Items #1 - 3, EQUEST, EP+ or TRNSYS will do. In the U.S. EQUEST is the most widely used by the AE community. Note, for most of these simulations an hourly simulation will do, which is not a true dynamic simulation.



4. To develop energy efficient control strategies and to test DDC controllers. (BEMS and emulation; maybe electric engineering field or ??)



For this you'll need MATLAB and a true dynamic simulation platform (i.e., it usually needs 1 sec or less time steps and true dynamic equations). Many of the U.S. controls companies have developed extensive tools for this, including Modelica/Dymola platforms. However, they do not distribute these outside their own companies. MATLAB is fast becoming a platform of choice, perhaps because most universities teach with it. There are other platforms as well, check with your local ME or EE controls Prof. Some that come to mind are HVACSiM+ (by George Walton at NIST).



5. To identify the system mal-function (such as AHU) comparing between ?predicted? energy and ?actual? energy in real-time. (BEMS, maybe electric engineering field??)



This is a tough one. LBNL and PNNL have been working on this for some time. PNNL has their AHU fault detection program, and other programs. LBNL has their controls test bed up and running. You might also check with the Chair of ASHRAE TC 7.5 to see what the latest RPs for controls simulation. This TC has most of the knowledgable folks on it (which does not include me).



6. Building Simulator: which is used to training building managers or operators or learners (students) in HVAC system operation realistically (such as flight simulator)



Check out Joe Deringer's LEARNHVAC web page...just amazing...there is also other emulator work at LBNL that Phil Haves and Michael Wetter are doing.



7. To ?JUST? verify Building behavior (HVAC operation, energy consumption, etc) over the whole year period with different whether conditions in IWEC and TMY. (to see "what could be")



This can be done with forward models (i.e., simulation) or inverse models (i.e., ASHRAE RP1050), or a combination of both. You can also use component models such as those available from ASHRAe (HVAC01 and HVAC02 toolkit, RP865, RP827, etc).



There are other proprietary tools that diagnose HVAC problems, some have published results, some not. You'll find lots of papers (apx., 3 - 5,000) on our Lab's web site about our commissioning work, which includes air-side simulation as a diagnostic.



Hope this helps.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] the use of dynamic energy simulation tool
Dear all,

I have been thinking about the use of dynamic energy simulation tool (e.g. whole building simulation tool, such as E+, ESP-r, TRNSYS, SPARK, etc).

The usage area of the tool would be classified into two, academic area and practical area.

But I really want to hear your high-level opinion on the practical areas.

The typical usage of energy simulation program in practice could be listed as follows (as far as I know),


1.     To get energy efficiency incentives, such as LEED certificate.

2.     To compare alternatives (wall material, window, building design) in architect point of view.

3.     To compare alternatives (system type and configuration, COP, etc.) in mechanical engineer point of view.

4.     To develop energy efficient control strategies and to test DDC controllers. (BEMS and emulation; maybe electric engineering field or ??)

5.     To identify the system mal-function (such as AHU) comparing between ?predicted? energy and ?actual? energy in real-time. (BEMS, maybe electric engineering field??)

6.     Building Simulator: which is used to training building managers or operators or learners (students) in HVAC system operation realistically (such as flight simulator)

7.     To ?JUST? verify Building behavior (HVAC operation, energy consumption, etc) over the whole year period with different whether conditions in IWEC and TMY. (to see "what could be")

I think that the large portion of usage would be #1.

But, the problem have been arisen due to the uncertainties and ?too many? required input values of dynamic simulation tools.

As far as I know in South Korea, many people say ?these tools are not suited to assess building energy performance with acceptable speed. And there is no evidence it is helpful to achieve energy reduction actually. Something are missing. We (AEC) do not want to do full dynamic simulation. We just need a tool that is simple and faster and reliable?.

These days, the government is willing to move their direction which requires architects just to submit a building energy analysis report using simple ISO toolkit.
(many of my colleague agree to need of the normative performance method, ISO 13790 and DIN 18599.)

Now, in this situation, we have to rethink about the purpose of doing full dynamic energy simulation (E+, ESP-r, TRNSYS, etc) with practicality in mind.

I think that its usage would be more suitable for #4, #5, #6 rather than #1, #2, #3. Because #1,#2,#3 can be evaluated using ISO standards with acceptable speed and accuracy.
(but I do not know well about the usage in the fields of #4, #5, #6)

I?m waiting your comments on my thoughts.

p.s. this topic was discussed in E+ user group before, and the contents are slightly revised for better discussions.

Best Regards,
Deuk-Woo, Kim

Hey Morgan:

 

As important as those measurements are the numbers that count are
comparative energy usage and comfort.  Those are the measures of true window
'performance' in my opinion.  A 50% decrease in air leakage may or may not
significantly impact energy usage and/or comfort.  We have been involved in
a number of window retrofit projects and in the real world what they save
and occupant comfort are what has meaning AND VALUE.

 

I urge you to at least include, and I believe they should be the principal
items, actual energy comparative usage information and comfort.  I feel that
it is a fallacy that there is a direct straight line meaningful and
impactful relationship between air leakage, u-value, and shgc, and, actual
energy usage and comfort except in the most gross sense.  Location, use,
individual window differences that do not show in any of those reported
measurements, and, installation our experience shows as more important.

 

Thanks,

 

Andy

Hi - I'm looking for papers where people have measured window performance

weatherstripping, caulking, and sealing.  Ideally papers that include air
leakage testing pre and post retrofit and u-value and shgc information.

The models can also be linked to hardware through BACnet and A/D converters using the Building Controls Virtual Test Bed,  <http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/bcvtb> http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/bcvtb.

 

See the papers, manuals and user guides at these web sites for more detailed information.

 

All the best,

Dear Deuk-Woo,

 

Here are a few comments on your questions:

 

1. To get energy efficiency incentives, such as LEED certificate. 

2. To compare alternatives (wall material, window, building design) in architect point of view. 

3. To compare alternatives (system type and configuration, COP, etc.) in mechanical engineer point of view. 

 

For Items #1 - 3, EQUEST, EP+ or TRNSYS will do. In the U.S. EQUEST is the most widely used by the AE community. Note, for most of these simulations an hourly simulation will do, which is not a true dynamic simulation.

 

4. To develop energy efficient control strategies and to test DDC controllers. (BEMS and emulation; maybe electric engineering field or ??)

 

For this you'll need MATLAB and a true dynamic simulation platform (i.e., it usually needs 1 sec or less time steps and true dynamic equations). Many of the U.S. controls companies have developed extensive tools for this, including Modelica/Dymola platforms. However, they do not distribute these outside their own companies. MATLAB is fast becoming a platform of choice, perhaps because most universities teach with it. There are other platforms as well, check with your local ME or EE controls Prof. Some that come to mind are HVACSiM+ (by George Walton at NIST).

 

5. To identify the system mal-function (such as AHU) comparing between ?predicted? energy and ?actual? energy in real-time. (BEMS, maybe electric engineering field??)

 

This is a tough one. LBNL and PNNL have been working on this for some time. PNNL has their AHU fault detection program, and other programs. LBNL has their controls test bed up and running. You might also check with the Chair of ASHRAE TC 7.5 to see what the latest RPs for controls simulation. This TC has most of the knowledgable folks on it (which does not include me). 

 

6. Building Simulator: which is used to training building managers or operators or learners (students) in HVAC system operation realistically (such as flight simulator)

 

Check out Joe Deringer's LEARNHVAC web page...just amazing...there is also other emulator work at LBNL that Phil Haves and Michael Wetter are doing.

 

7. To ?JUST? verify Building behavior (HVAC operation, energy consumption, etc) over the whole year period with different whether conditions in IWEC and TMY. (to see "what could be")

 

This can be done with forward models (i.e., simulation) or inverse models (i.e., ASHRAE RP1050), or a combination of both. You can also use component models such as those available from ASHRAe (HVAC01 and HVAC02 toolkit, RP865, RP827, etc).

 

There are other proprietary tools that diagnose HVAC problems, some have published results, some not. You'll find lots of papers (apx., 3 - 5,000) on our Lab's web site about our commissioning work, which includes air-side simulation as a diagnostic. 

 

Hope this helps.

 

Jeff

Subject: [Bldg-sim] the use of dynamic energy simulation tool

Dear all, 

 

I have been thinking about the use of dynamic energy simulation tool (e.g. whole building simulation tool, such as E+, ESP-r, TRNSYS, SPARK, etc). 

 

The usage area of the tool would be classified into two, academic area and practical area.

 

But I really want to hear your high-level opinion on the practical areas.

 

The typical usage of energy simulation program in practice could be listed as follows (as far as I know), 

 

1.     To get energy efficiency incentives, such as LEED certificate. 

2.     To compare alternatives (wall material, window, building design) in architect point of view. 

3.     To compare alternatives (system type and configuration, COP, etc.) in mechanical engineer point of view. 

4.     To develop energy efficient control strategies and to test DDC controllers. (BEMS and emulation; maybe electric engineering field or ??)

5.     To identify the system mal-function (such as AHU) comparing between ?predicted? energy and ?actual? energy in real-time. (BEMS, maybe electric engineering field??)

6.     Building Simulator: which is used to training building managers or operators or learners (students) in HVAC system operation realistically (such as flight simulator)

7.     To ?JUST? verify Building behavior (HVAC operation, energy consumption, etc) over the whole year period with different whether conditions in IWEC and TMY. (to see "what could be")

 

I think that the large portion of usage would be #1. 

 

But, the problem have been arisen due to the uncertainties and ?too many? required input values of dynamic simulation tools. 

 

As far as I know in South Korea, many people say ?these tools are not suited to assess building energy performance with acceptable speed. And there is no evidence it is helpful to achieve energy reduction actually. Something are missing. We (AEC) do not want to do full dynamic simulation. We just need a tool that is simple and faster and reliable?. 

 

These days, the government is willing to move their direction which requires architects just to submit a building energy analysis report using simple ISO toolkit. 

(many of my colleague agree to need of the normative performance method, ISO 13790 and DIN 18599.)

 

Now, in this situation, we have to rethink about the purpose of doing full dynamic energy simulation (E+, ESP-r, TRNSYS, etc) with practicality in mind.

 

I think that its usage would be more suitable for #4, #5, #6 rather than #1, #2, #3. Because #1,#2,#3 can be evaluated using ISO standards with acceptable speed and accuracy. 

(but I do not know well about the usage in the fields of #4, #5, #6)

 

I?m waiting your comments on my thoughts.

 

p.s. this topic was discussed in E+ user group before, and the contents are slightly revised for better discussions. 

 

Best Regards, 
Deuk-Woo, Kim

Hi Everyone,
?
I am quite confused between what the ASHRAE 90.1 and the user?s manual tell us about Building Envelope Mandatory Provisions:
?
5.4 Mandatory Provisions
?5.4.1 Insulation.Where insulation is required in Section
5.5 or 5.6, it shall comply with the requirements found in Sections
5.8.1.1 through 5.8.1.9.? - ASHRAE 90.1-2007
?
?
Insulation (? 5.8.1)
?The first set of mandatory requirements
addresses the proper installation and
protection of insulation materials. Issues
that are covered include compression of
insulation, installing insulation on sloping
ceilings and around recessed equipment,
and protecting insulation from physical or
moisture damage.?-ASHRAE 90.1-2007-User?s Manual
?
?
Does this mean that we could use insulation that is not as efficient as indicated in Table 5.5-1 through 5.5-8 as long as it complies with?Section 5.8.1.1 through 5.8.1.9?
?
Your thoughts are highly appreciated.

place in their region, including conferences and meetings. Items related to
software news are also encouraged: new releases, updates, new versions,
training seminars, notable projects, etc. - all gratefully received. 

 

Please send the article(s) to me at your earliest convenience so they arrive
before 25th March 2012, if possible.

 

Many thanks for your assistance and contributions.

Mandatory requirements means they are not available for trade off when using the procedures in Appendix C or Chapter 11 (ECB). Tables 5.5-1 through 5.5-8 are prescriptive requirements which can be traded off against. Hope that helps.

Nick,
Yes and Yes, however there a number of weatherseals ranging from the curtains you show to a glorified 'pillow' that bolts onto the building and truck smushes against it.

Am I correct in asserting such weather sealing means is not required of on-grade rolling doors which will not in regular use have vehicles parked against them?

Thanks,

5.4.1 states that where insulation is required, 
it must be labelled and installed according to 
the requirements of 5.8.1.1 - 5.8.1.9.
If insulation is required, the performance of the 
insulation must meet the requirements of 5.5 or 
5.6.  Section 5.5 is prescriptive and you must 
have the insulation levels specified in Tables 
5.8.1.1-5.8..1.9 - as a minimum.

If the project doesn't meet the prescriptive 
requirements, you must meet either the Section 
5.6, the Building Trade-Off Option.

Alternately, you may show compliance using the 
Energy Cost Budget Method, Section 11 as long as Section 5.4 is met.

In some jurisdictions, the building permit 
process requires showing compliance with the 
prescriptive or building trade off method.  I 
always use the building trade off method using 
EnvStd as it is quicker than filling in the 
prescriptive tables and EnvStd produces a nicely 
formatted report gets quick approval from the building code official.

Hello,
My experience with design builder has been very positive.

Benefits:
Excellent drawing tool
Customizable construction libraries
Produces working IDF files that can be edited in Energy Plus

Negatives
Does not have up to date ASHRAE libraries
Does not produce compliance reports
(these issues may be solved in the near future)

If you have any more specific questions please feel free to ask..

Hi Alex,
I have been using DesignBuilder for over a year now. Its nice front end user-interface for EnergyPlus.

Positives:
Excellent drawing tool
Good graphical interface
USerfriendly interface; co-ordinate and logic-driven 

Negatives:
Does not have all simulation capabilities of Energyplus; for ex. detailed HVAC. This has been taken care of in the newer version though

If you have any questions feel free to ask. I'm quiet a novice with it but will try my best to answer them.

Message-ID: <CALKTE9QtcoJUOg6x1fBvVNPYB65PsT7XO1eFS28B14p22tx-Fg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Simulators,

I am working on modeling Phase Change Materials in Energy Plus and would
like to experiment with workarounds in other software.

My research shows that the only way to model phase change meterials of any
type correctly is to use Energy Plus,  ESP-r, or  TRNSYS, and that for
the dupont energain product EDSL Tas Building Designer, also there is a
tool called PCM express that provides limited functionality.

I have been told that workarounds have been preformed in the past to model
PCM's in the following simulation software:
? eQuest
? Carrier
? RemDesign

Also I have been provided with the graph below, and I wonder if anyone on
the list may understand how this was created in eQuest?

Good morning Jeremiah****

** **

Thank you for your reply , ****

Do you think that Design Builder is a good tool for Building envelope
analyses  in particular, in comparison with other software , like eQuest,
Trace700, Energy Gauge, IES-VE. ****

And how widely is it used in USA, and in commercial application ? if you
are familiar. ****

** **

Thanks for your time ****

Alex,
I guess it depends on your application.
For me I am modeling phase change envelope materials, so design builder's
ability to produce energy plus Editable IDF's makes it the only option.

I am an eQuest user, and find that design builder is the closest in ease of
use to eQuest, but provides much more capability.

My understanding of Trace 500 is that it can do envelope studies, but is a
tool created to best serve mechanical engineers, or HVAC specialists.
I have not used energy gauge, and have not run a full simulation in
IES-VE,, but do find the interface to be nice.

What is key is to understand the simulation engine behind the software.

Both eQuest and Trace 500 use DOE 2.2, Design builder uses Energy Plus 7,
and their own custom computational fluid dynamics visualization.  I believe
Energy gauge may and IES-VE both use their own engine (you should check)

Energy Plus is the most compressive tool available, and is funded by the
department of energy but does not have an easy to use interface, ( that is
where design builder comes in handy) DOE 2.2 is very powerful, but is
limited in features and is typically used with eQuest as an interface.

For most projects compliance is the main goal, and visualization of
 results is second.

Both Energy Plus ( design builder ) and DOE 2.2 ( eQuest/Trace ect ) are
compliant with ASHRAE 140, and can be used for tax credits, LEED projects
ect..

Other software sometimes is not qualified to use in compliance, so have
less value In many projects.

Personally I prefer design builder/energy plus over other modeling tools,
due to it's ability to model both envelop and HVAC systems in detail, and
due to the great support, and the latest has incorporated up to date ASHRAE
libraries.

Thanks and feel free to ask any further questions..

Thanks Christan,
The comment on the PDF on "DOE-2 simulations to obtain realistic
temperatures and air flows for the VAV system, then we used RADCOOL (Stetiu
et al. 1995), a finite difference building simulation program written in
the Simulation Problem Analysis and Research Kernel (SPARK) environment, to
model the thermal performance of the space equipped with phase change" is
an unexpected work around, never herd of and can not find a copy of RADCOOL.

About the refrig section of DOE2 doc libraries I searched
http://doe2.com/download/DOE-22/DOE22Vol4-Libraries_47.pdf for the mention
of PCM, but did not find, so looked in refrigeration and found some
varribles that I suppose may be able to be customized, or am I looking in
the wrong doc?

Leen,



This depends on whether or not the wind is blowing... or not. ASHRAE used to have tabluated values (still in some textbooks) of R = .17 Btu/ft2-hr-F for winter (15 mph wind) and .25 Btu/ft2-hr-F for summer (7 mph wind). Otherwise, for a vertical surface it would be .68 for free convection, probably less for a tilted surface, .9 if horizontal heat flow down.



Also, radiation can be significant if the surface is facing a cloudless sky. I think Kreider's solar textbook has a equation for sky temperature...which is somewhat complicated by cloud cover, etc.

It's true wind does dominate external convection.

Hi Chris,

CIBSE suggest to replace g with gcos(theta) in the Grasshof number. That
means, it accounts for the roof being tilted in natural convection. When it
comes to roofs, there is another aspects that starts to be important ...
the roof finishing in tiles will have a 'detoriated' velocity underneath
the tiles. It is mainly that one directing the convective losses ...

Am I correct on this?

Hi Leen,

I'm not familiar with the calculation involving the Grasshof number. The 
formula given is hc= 4+4v, where hc is the convection coefficient and v 
is the wind velocity. The formula is probably derived empirically (don't 
know for certain). Are you definitely talking about the convection 
element of heat transfer or are you talking lw radiation?

Regards

Chris

Hi Leen,

I did my PhD work on Building Integrated Photovoltaic/Thermal systems.

My work was mostly focused at the interior convective heat transfer coefficients in the cavity/gap between PV modules and the next layer of building envelope in the roof where the air flowed. 

However I looked numerically the influence of different wind correlations:

Leen,
 
This depends on whether or not the wind is blowing... or not. ASHRAE used to have tabluated values (still in some textbooks) of R = .17 Btu/ft2-hr-F for winter (15 mph wind) and .25 Btu/ft2-hr-F for summer (7 mph wind). Otherwise, for a vertical surface
 it would be .68 for free convection, probably less for a tilted surface, .9 if horizontal heat flow down.

 
Also, radiation can be significant if the surface is facing a cloudless sky. I think Kreider's solar textbook has a equation for sky temperature...which is somewhat complicated by cloud cover, etc.

Dear,
 
can anyone point me to some reference values for exterior convection coefficients for tilted surfaces like a roof?
 
Thanks

It's true wind does dominate external convection.

Hi Chris,
 
CIBSE suggest to replace g with gcos(theta) in the Grasshof number. That means, it accounts for the roof being tilted in natural convection. When it comes to roofs, there is another aspects that starts to be important ... the roof finishing in tiles will have a 'detoriated' velocity underneath the tiles. It is mainly that one directing the convective losses ...

 
Am I correct on this?

    Hi Leen,

    

    I'm not familiar with the calculation involving the Grasshof number.
    The formula given is hc= 4+4v, where hc is the convection
    coefficient and v is the wind velocity. The formula is probably
    derived empirically (don't know for certain). Are you definitely
    talking about the convection element of heat transfer or are you
    talking lw radiation?

    

    Regards

    

    Chris

Hi Leen,

I did my PhD work on Building Integrated Photovoltaic/Thermal systems.

My
 work was mostly focused at the interior convective heat transfer 
coefficients in the cavity/gap between PV modules and the next layer of 
building envelope in the roof where the air flowed. 

However I looked numerically the influence of different wind correlations:



Test et al. (1981), Sharples and Charlesworth (1998), McAdams (McAdams, W.H.,
1954; Duffie, J.A. & Beckman, W.A.,

2006) as a function of the wind speed in m/s:

ho = 8.55
+ 2.56
?Vwind 

ho =11.9+2.2?Vwind


h=5.7+3.8Vwind 


and also I used a correction factor for the Wind speed at the height of my experimental setup.



 (Hutcheon, Handegord, 1995)


Vwind=Vg(Z/Zg)^alphawind


 In general I found that the Sharples and Charlesworth correlations gave me the best results.

You can look at my thesis and this paper

Candanedo, L. M., Athienitis, A., Candanedo, J., O?Brien, W., Chen, Y., 
(2010). Transient and Steady State Models for Open-Loop Air-Based BIPV/T
 Systems. ASHRAE Transactions. Vol 116. P. 600-612.

Leen,

 

This depends on whether or not the wind is blowing... or not. ASHRAE used to have tabluated values (still in some textbooks) of R = .17 Btu/ft2-hr-F for winter (15 mph wind) and .25 Btu/ft2-hr-F for summer (7 mph wind). Otherwise, for a vertical surface
 it would be .68 for free convection, probably less for a tilted surface, .9 if horizontal heat flow down.


 

Also, radiation can be significant if the surface is facing a cloudless sky. I think Kreider's solar textbook has a equation for sky temperature...which is somewhat complicated by cloud cover, etc.

I've only seen reference values of interior convection coefficients for tilted surfaces, not exterior coefficients: which are available for summer & winter conditions, due to the difference in wind velocity.

Dear,
 
can anyone point me to some reference values for exterior convection coefficients for tilted surfaces like a roof?
 
Thanks

Hi Chris,
 
CIBSE suggest to replace g with gcos(theta) in the Grasshof number. That means, it accounts for the roof being tilted in natural convection. When it comes to roofs, there is another aspects that starts to be important ... the roof finishing in tiles will have a 'detoriated' velocity underneath the tiles. It is mainly that one directing the convective losses ...

 
Am I correct on this?

    Hi Leen,

    

    I'm not familiar with the calculation involving the Grasshof number.
    The formula given is hc= 4+4v, where hc is the convection
    coefficient and v is the wind velocity. The formula is probably
    derived empirically (don't know for certain). Are you definitely
    talking about the convection element of heat transfer or are you
    talking lw radiation?

    

    Regards

    

    Chris

Dear all,

I am looking for TES (storage tanks) models for PCM / Ice storage systems that can be coupled to TRNSYS or EnergyPlus. The models could be used for peak shaving performance.

Can anyone please point me in the right direction?

Thanks,

Hi,

I would like to model a baseline building of Ashrae 90.1 2007 conditioning with VAV system (system 5) in DesignBuilder. This system cools the building using DX cooling. However, I have branch errors when I model dx coils in vav system. Therefore, I would like to ask how I can model VAV system with DX cooling. If it is impossible using DesignBuilder, I would like to ask how I can model cooling system to be suited to system 5 in ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G ?

Best regards.

Hi Ayzer,

You must make the system a Packaged VAV system.  The difference here is
that the cooling will come from a DX coil rather than a Chilled Water coil.

Hope this helps.

Is anyone aware of a computer design tool called 'SolAC' that had been
developed for Solar Assisted Air Conditioning? I found a reference in
one of the research papers 
on this topic, and was directed to the following website:
http://iea-shc-task38.org/task-25/downloads
<http://iea-shc-task38.org/task-25/downloads> 
 
Apparently the tool used to be free for download, but is no longer
available.
 
If somebody has a copy and is willing to share, I would greatly
appreciate it.
Thanks a lot

eSim brings together professionals, academics and students interested in
building performance simulation advancements and applications. The 2012
conference is hosted by Dalhousie University in collaboration with Natural
Resources Canada. It will be held in the beautiful port city of Halifax,
Canada on May 2 and 3, 2012, with workshops held one day pre and post the
conference. Themes of the eSim conference surround the modeling and
simulation of processes and performance of the built environment. This
includes all aspects of building simulation ranging from the simulators
themselves to results of unique and innovative models. Coverage includes
modeling physical processes (energy, occupant comfort, daylighting, etc.),
control methods, community energy systems, building simulator tools, use of

Many of the simulation tools have getting started guides or tutorials - although those are likely to be tied to that particular software program.

The BEMBook (Building Energy Modeling Book) from IBPSA-USA has a lot of content - particularly the 'Practitioner's BEM Overview'...

Daylighting and Daysim with eQUEST

Instructors: Mike Nicklas, FAIA and Umesh Atre, Associate AIA, LEED AP, Innovative Design Inc.
Of all high performance building design strategies, none will have a greater positive impact than daylighting. As occupants and building management personnel become increasingly aware of the energy, health, and productivity benefits associated with controlled daylighting, more and more designers are implementing these proven strategies.
This full-day workshop will first address those engaged in building design and will focus on issues critical to good daylighting. The workshop will then focus on translating the daylighting principles presented in the daylighting session into usable daylighting metrics. Participants will be introduced to computer modeling techniques using the 'Daysim' software. The 3-D modeling software 'SketchUp' is used to create the daylighting models, and the energy modeling software 'eQUEST' will be used to demonstrate how daylighting results can be incorporated into energy models.
This workshop will carry participants through the key steps, from design concept to graphic model to Daysim's daylighting analysis to eQUEST's overall building energy simulation. Participants are assumed to have a basic working knowledge of eQUEST. Because of this assumed knowledge level regarding eQUEST, the workshop will not focus on general eQUEST training but rather on how to interface with DAYSIM and key issues relative how to interpret the information that results from eQUEST.
The workshop will focus on the following:

  *   Consideration of human factors
  *   Consideration of energy ramifications
  *   Accounting for site constraints and benefits
  *   Integrating daylighting strategies into your design
  *   Introduction to Daysim,
  *   Development of and using SketchUp models with Daysim,
  *   Detailed walkthrough of Daysim,
  *   Understanding Daysim output, and
  *   Converting Daysim output into usable hourly daylighting schedules for eQUEST
Early-bird pricing this workshop is $350. Early-bird pricing will close on March 15, 2012. Price will then increase to $425 (discount automatically applied and credited at check-out)

I am putting the parking lot lighting into the energy model using Trane Trace 700.

Sunrise and sunset change every day.  What is the best/easiest way to model the parking lot lighting.  

I know the weather file has the sunrise/sunset information, but I'm not sure if there is a way to tie this to the parking lot lighting.

As of now, I plan to figure out the length of 'night time' during the equinox at my location and assume that it is the same every day.  This should give a very close approximation.

Hey John!

Take a few minutes to play around with the slider bars on this web-learning-thingy:  http://astro.unl.edu/classaction/animations/coordsmotion/daylighthoursexplorer.html

This taught me that (unintuitively!) the "yearly average" in hours per night is actually a constant - 12!  Some places near the poles get long periods with no daylight, but those same locations get equally long periods with no nighttime... it all kinda evens out =).

This should help simplify your approximation approach - sorry I can't offer any Trace-specific advice due to my inexperience with the software.  Hopefully there's some quick way of defining "photocell" controls, but if not and you need such annual variations worked into your model I suppose you could define a latitude-specific schedule for the load manually... I might personally sooner explore whether an eQuest model is time-feasible =).

Just to throw another option on the table...

The Naval Oceanography division maintains detailed daylight/darkness tables calculated based on any latitude/longitude coordinate set or for many US cities by name.  The data is given in hours and minutes of daylight ordarkness.  The coordinates-based data can be retrieved from:

http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/astronomical-applications/data-services/duration-world

I created a spreadsheet macro to import the data table from a text file (in Internet Explorer, use "File" and "Save As..." to save the table that pops up as a text file).  From there, the spreadsheet does the math.  While it generally confirms the 12-hour average Nick uses as a good conservative estimate, here are three specific results from the Navy data:

Milwaukee, WI for all of 2012 has 4,468.5 hours of daylight (12.21 hours per day, including Feb 29)
Los Angeles, CA for all of 2012 has 4,455.7 hours of daylight (12.17 hours per day, including Feb 29)
Denver, CO for all of 2012 has 4,463.2 hours of daylight (12.19 hours per day, including Feb 29)

I use this more for energy audits as a simple calculator for implementing astronomical control for exterior lighting in older buildings with basic or no control.  But, you could use this to do the math and create the input necessary for Trace to incorporate the load.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Radiant slab Heating Cooling
Message-ID: <CALz=1DPqsQKP5fhB5eircRv1i3ueYJ2=vJyRnJMjT6eznTXS-g@mail.gmail.com>

Good Morning everyone,



I have been reading through the archives for modeling radiant slab heating
and cooling.

Most popular and the closest to real world approach I found was using a 4
pipe fan coil unit and making the fan energy zero.

I still have following questions:

?         Did anyone think of using a factor, which when multiplied to the
energy usage by fan coil system, give us the actual energy usage by radiant
system. (I would guess it would be <1)

?         As radiant heating and cooling forms a stratification layer in
the space. And  we care about first 6-8 feet to be within desired
temperature range. So to take that into account while modeling ?it?  as fan
coil unit, can we lower the ceiling height. Does that mean the conduction
load from ceiling/roof or the wall above 6-8 feet doesn?t count ?

?         The temperature range for heating water (95F-105F) and cooling
water (55F-65F) pumped in the radiant system is different from the typical
chilled water (44F-45F) and heating water (170F-180F). How do we make sure
our model reflects this while using fan coil unit.



I am sure there are more questions you would have come across but these
were some of my major concerns and I would appreciate any inputs/
suggestions.

PS: This is a aspiring LEED platinum building.

Thanks and Best Regards,



Sincerely,

Varun Kulkarni

Varun, your perception is nearly true, but it depends on what you are modeling? If you are modeling the energy performance of a building a four pipe fan coil works just fine as it maintains the required energy balance. It is true that the actual performance of a radiant floor is different than a fan coil, but you are looking at energy and not optimal modeling.
Your thoughts on stratification are somewhat correct. I would tend to think that stratification is caused by space heat load and air movement, especially displacement. Yes, there is a convective flow from the floor but this is quite small as the temperature difference between the floor surface temperature and the space operating temperature.
Regarding temperature; this depends on what program you are using and why you want to segregate the different temperatures?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Radiant slab Heating Cooling

Good Morning everyone,

I have been reading through the archives for modeling radiant slab heating and cooling.
Most popular and the closest to real world approach I found was using a 4 pipe fan coil unit and making the fan energy zero.
I still have following questions:

*         Did anyone think of using a factor, which when multiplied to the energy usage by fan coil system, give us the actual energy usage by radiant system. (I would guess it would be <1)

*         As radiant heating and cooling forms a stratification layer in the space. And  we care about first 6-8 feet to be within desired temperature range. So to take that into account while modeling "it"  as fan coil unit, can we lower the ceiling height. Does that mean the conduction load from ceiling/roof or the wall above 6-8 feet doesn't count ?

*         The temperature range for heating water (95F-105F) and cooling water (55F-65F) pumped in the radiant system is different from the typical chilled water (44F-45F) and heating water (170F-180F). How do we make sure our model reflects this while using fan coil unit.

I am sure there are more questions you would have come across but these were some of my major concerns and I would appreciate any inputs/ suggestions.
PS: This is a aspiring LEED platinum building.

Thanks Peter,

I am using Carrier HAP and when I model a fan coil unit, I am asked to
input the design supply temperatures for heating and cooling (which is
usually 95F and 55F). Now, i think these are going to drive my energy
consumed at the boiler and chiller. The whole point (not the only point but
a major though) of using radiant slab heating and cooling is lower temps
for heating, higher temps for cooling and also the fact that water has
higher energy carrying capacity then air. So if you are not able to take
credit for that in modeling then obviously, the energy consumption number
is not right. Thats my reason to segregate the different temperatures.

All

Is no one worried about the time characteristics of in-floor cooling (and heating) systems, i.e. the time lag between heat gains (or losses) and terminal/plant loads?, some kind of fudge factor would likely be required for software like DOE but what might one do?

When doing the LEED project, do I need to use the actual window shape, or just keep the window-wall ratio in each direction?
I don't think the window shape will influence the energy cost if the window-wall ratio is the same. But I don't know if the LEED reviewer care about it.

Thanks a lot!

Varun, you might want to graduate from the HAP program. Unless you have two chillers one for 42F water and another for 55F, then most systems produce 42F water and then blend to 55F, so the potential savings are difficult to obtain. By the way what is the ratio of your radiant floor to conditioned air output?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Radiant slab Heating Cooling

Good Morning everyone,

I have been reading through the archives for modeling radiant slab heating and cooling.
Most popular and the closest to real world approach I found was using a 4 pipe fan coil unit and making the fan energy zero.
I still have following questions:

*         Did anyone think of using a factor, which when multiplied to the energy usage by fan coil system, give us the actual energy usage by radiant system. (I would guess it would be <1)

*         As radiant heating and cooling forms a stratification layer in the space. And  we care about first 6-8 feet to be within desired temperature range. So to take that into account while modeling "it"  as fan coil unit, can we lower the ceiling height. Does that mean the conduction load from ceiling/roof or the wall above 6-8 feet doesn't count ?

*         The temperature range for heating water (95F-105F) and cooling water (55F-65F) pumped in the radiant system is different from the typical chilled water (44F-45F) and heating water (170F-180F). How do we make sure our model reflects this while using fan coil unit.

I am sure there are more questions you would have come across but these were some of my major concerns and I would appreciate any inputs/ suggestions.
PS: This is a aspiring LEED platinum building.

Hi Varun

As a work around in DOE2. You may model the actual design temperatures and
increase/decrease the indoor set points for cooling/heating by some margin.

the parallel fan powered VAV consist of a main fan in the AHU and small parallel fans in the VAV boxes.
so how should these fans be simulated in equest?
Shall the main fan be set as the return fan, and the parallel fans be set as the supply fan?
Thanks a lot!

All,
Radiant heating/cooling does not address the latent load. So if you have a
space/building served by radiant heating/cooling, you have to have a
ventilation unit (which might supply neutral air). This considerably gives
a huge amount of saving when coupled with DCV.
Another point point is that a chiller with 55F LWT and boiler with 100F LWT
would use less energy than conventional chiler/boiler LWT range. So, as
Amit said, a de-coupler is needed (may be a heat exchanger) for chilled
water and heating water to tie into other equipments in the building such
as snowmelt, air handlers..
By the ratio of radiant floor and conditioned floor output, do you mean the
ratio of energy consumed if the building was conditioned with either of the
two approach?

So if using a DOE based tool for instance are you suggesting you use a "lightweight" classification

Here in Canada the EE4 Modeling Guide recommends using "one weight heavier than the actual construction" which intuitive I have always had a problem with.

Of course I would expect the time load characteristics to vary between a floor receiving direct radiation and one in shade but this is probably too much detail for the average modeling exercise.

I don't believe the Olesen paper (ASHRAE Sep 20008) addresses the time lag issue, is there another paper? I don't recall seeing anything as I have kept an eye open for such discussions>

All

Is no one worried about the time characteristics of in-floor cooling (and heating) systems, i.e. the time lag between heat gains (or losses) and terminal/plant loads?, some kind of fudge factor would likely be required for software like DOE but what might one do?

Thanks Peter,

I am using Carrier HAP and when I model a fan coil unit, I am asked to input the design supply temperatures for heating and cooling (which is usually 95F and 55F). Now, i think these are going to drive my energy consumed at the boiler and chiller. The whole point (not the only point but a major though) of using radiant slab heating and cooling is lower temps for heating, higher temps for cooling and also the fact that water has higher energy carrying capacity then air. So if you are not able to take credit for that in modeling then obviously, the energy consumption number is not right. Thats my reason to segregate the different temperatures.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Radiant slab Heating Cooling

Good Morning everyone,

I have been reading through the archives for modeling radiant slab heating and cooling.
Most popular and the closest to real world approach I found was using a 4 pipe fan coil unit and making the fan energy zero.
I still have following questions:

*         Did anyone think of using a factor, which when multiplied to the energy usage by fan coil system, give us the actual energy usage by radiant system. (I would guess it would be <1)

*         As radiant heating and cooling forms a stratification layer in the space. And  we care about first 6-8 feet to be within desired temperature range. So to take that into account while modeling "it"  as fan coil unit, can we lower the ceiling height. Does that mean the conduction load from ceiling/roof or the wall above 6-8 feet doesn't count ?

*         The temperature range for heating water (95F-105F) and cooling water (55F-65F) pumped in the radiant system is different from the typical chilled water (44F-45F) and heating water (170F-180F). How do we make sure our model reflects this while using fan coil unit.

I am sure there are more questions you would have come across but these were some of my major concerns and I would appreciate any inputs/ suggestions.
PS: This is a aspiring LEED platinum building.

Message-ID: <2646bb0d.21065.135af961c79.Coremail.e2fye2@163.com>

Dear all,


Should the rooftop unit efficiency requirement refer to the air cooled type in Table 6.8.1B in the ASHRAE90.1?
I'm simulating a system6 hvac system.
The efficiency of the type is so low that the hvac consumes a lot of energy.
So I wonder if it is correct to refer to the Table6.8.1B.
thanks!

the parallel fan powered VAV consist of a main fan in the AHU and small
parallel fans in the VAV boxes.

so how should these fans be simulated in equest?

Shall the main fan be set as the return fan, and the parallel fans be
set as the supply fan?

Hi Esmireta,

I'm not sure about what LEED requires, but I would be aware that in addition to Window-Wall Ratio, you should also consider Glass-Frame ratio. Depending on the software and method that you model windows, two 3'x5' windows with a 1" frame are NOT the same as one 6'x5' window (the 6'x5' would have two vertical components, whereas the two 3'x5' would have four vertical components). I'm not sure a LEED reviewer would notice the difference, but I think best practice is to include the correct frame area in your model.

Kind regards,
Alex Krickx

I don't think the window shape will influence the energy cost if the window-wall ratio is the same. But I don't know if the LEED reviewer care about it.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Need to extract summer peak demand info from REM/Rate
Message-ID: <017c01ccf317$858b0660$90a11320$@com>

My company has identified a need to estimate peak demand information for
homes that have been inspected by HERS raters and are modeled in REM/Rate.
We are not HERS providers or sub-licensed raters, so we do not own or
currently use REM/Rate ourselves. I understand that REM/Rate employs a
seasonal methodology that does not predict hourly values, so I have a
two-part question:

 

1.       Despite the lack of hourly simulation values, is there a way to
derive peak demand information (e.g. given a definition of 'peak') using
REM/Rate?

2.       I'm interested to know whether anybody has experience creating
input files for other simulation software (any software that does
residential modeling and provides 8760 output) from REM/Rate .blg files.

 

Thanks!

REM Rate uses a delta T over area HDD/CDD calculation-- not an hourly
simulation, so peak loads can not be truly addressed. You could to derive
an average number by calculating the annual use then dividing by hours of
year, but that still would not solve your problem.

You could use eQuest, Energy Plus, TRNSYS or Sunrel.

I advise Energy Plus.

I am assuming you are talking about for the proposed building & not the baseline. Reasons you need the window shape:

*         Account for accurate frame conditions - if you have five windows of 4x8, and one large window of 20x8 - the first one will have more overall conductance that the latter.

*         Account for accurate shading effects - this can be overcome easier.

If you have identical windows, you can use a multiplier that will get you what you need - although I'm not sure how the multiplier works with daylighting.

Hope this helps

Jeremiah and others, thanks for your comments.

 

My second question is not whether, simply, to use an alternate software - I
believe I will need to if we are to accomplish our objective. Rather, the
situation is that the information I have to describe the homes I need to
model are .blg files generated by HERS raters. Given that I may want to use
an alternate simulation software, is anyone familiar with a tool that will
take a REM/Rate .blg input file and convert it into an input file I could
use for one of those alternate modeling software packages.

 

Thanks!

Varun,

 

You can use the workaround you mentioned for modeling radiant cooling and heating, and at the same time model the effects of your supply water temperatures for the chiller and boiler plants.  There is no conflict in HAP for doing both.  However, as Peter and others point out, you may need the chillers to operate with a cold LCHWT like 42 F anyway to serve your DOAS which is handling the full dehumidification load for your building and other chilled water consumers like AHUs if they exist. 

 

As part of your software license you have free access to HAP software support at software.systems at carrier.utc.com.  The support desk is staffed by engineers with decades of experience in HVAC design and application engineering, who are also experts in the software.  They can help you sort out these kinds of issues to determine which features of the software are best to use for your application.

 

Best Regards,

 

Jim Pegues

All,

Radiant heating/cooling does not address the latent load. So if you have a space/building served by radiant heating/cooling, you have to have a ventilation unit (which might supply neutral air). This considerably gives a huge amount of saving when coupled with DCV.

Another point point is that a chiller with 55F LWT and boiler with 100F LWT would use less energy than conventional chiler/boiler LWT range. So, as Amit said, a de-coupler is needed (may be a heat exchanger) for chilled water and heating water to tie into other equipments in the building such as snowmelt, air handlers..

By the ratio of radiant floor and conditioned floor output, do you mean the ratio of energy consumed if the building was conditioned with either of the two approach?

	Varun, you might want to graduate from the HAP program. Unless you have two chillers one for 42F water and another for 55F, then most systems produce 42F water and then blend to 55F, so the potential savings are difficult to obtain. By the way what is the ratio of your radiant floor to conditioned air output?

	Thanks Peter,

	 

	I am using Carrier HAP and when I model a fan coil unit, I am asked to input the design supply temperatures for heating and cooling (which is usually 95F and 55F). Now, i think these are going to drive my energy consumed at the boiler and chiller. The whole point (not the only point but a major though) of using radiant slab heating and cooling is lower temps for heating, higher temps for cooling and also the fact that water has higher energy carrying capacity then air. So if you are not able to take credit for that in modeling then obviously, the energy consumption number is not right. Thats my reason to segregate the different temperatures.

	Varun, your perception is nearly true, but it depends on what you are modeling? If you are modeling the energy performance of a building a four pipe fan coil works just fine as it maintains the required energy balance. It is true that the actual performance of a radiant floor is different than a fan coil, but you are looking at energy and not optimal modeling.

	Your thoughts on stratification are somewhat correct. I would tend to think that stratification is caused by space heat load and air movement, especially displacement. Yes, there is a convective flow from the floor but this is quite small as the temperature difference between the floor surface temperature and the space operating temperature.

	Regarding temperature; this depends on what program you are using and why you want to segregate the different temperatures?

	Subject: [Bldg-sim] Radiant slab Heating Cooling

	 

	Good Morning everyone,

	 

	I have been reading through the archives for modeling radiant slab heating and cooling.

	Most popular and the closest to real world approach I found was using a 4 pipe fan coil unit and making the fan energy zero.

	I still have following questions:

	?         Did anyone think of using a factor, which when multiplied to the energy usage by fan coil system, give us the actual energy usage by radiant system. (I would guess it would be <1)

	?         As radiant heating and cooling forms a stratification layer in the space. And  we care about first 6-8 feet to be within desired temperature range. So to take that into account while modeling ?it?  as fan coil unit, can we lower the ceiling height. Does that mean the conduction load from ceiling/roof or the wall above 6-8 feet doesn?t count ?

	?         The temperature range for heating water (95F-105F) and cooling water (55F-65F) pumped in the radiant system is different from the typical chilled water (44F-45F) and heating water (170F-180F). How do we make sure our model reflects this while using fan coil unit.

	 

	I am sure there are more questions you would have come across but these were some of my major concerns and I would appreciate any inputs/ suggestions.

	PS: This is a aspiring LEED platinum building.

Dear All,

Similar discussion have happened on this subject. But still couldn't get clarity so i am posting the question again.

There are a number of default chiller curves available in Visual doe or equest software. But do we have to construct a baseline chiller curve and input for the base case? How to make sure ASHRAE 90.1 IPLV is captured for the chiller in baseline case?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] FWR and walls adjacent unconditioned space
Message-ID: <20120225131643.A5B9E8DB139D@zapata.dreamhost.com>

I am not sure how glazing in walls adjacent unconditioned spaces 
counts towards the building FWR.

For example, I am looking at a MURB.  The main floor is part covered 
parking, unconditioned space, the second floor is over the parking 
area.  There is a conditioned corridor that runs beside the 
parkade.  The wall along this corridor has windows looking into the 
parking area.

1.  Does this glass count towards the building fenestration-wall-ratio?
2.  For prescriptive purposes, is this glass considered as "wall 
adjacent an unconditioned space"? Or is it considered glazing?

Hi Ratha Shree..

This is only my opinion.

I would only worry about the Chiller COP or kW/ton. You cannot create an IPLV curve unless you know the kW/ton at the 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% points. Otherwise, it is one equation and three unknowns 9you DO know the 100% point).

I believe the DOE-2 curves are good enough for the Baseline, having been through 1000s of analysis in the private and governmental sectors.Unless ASHRAE can PROVIDE those four aforementioned points.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] why the autosized design air flow rate differ so much in
 different floor?
Message-ID: <78477178.1bc51.135b9a4c781.Coremail.foolishstar@163.com>

Hi, every body,


I now have a difficult problem. I found that the autosized design air flow in the first floor is much larger than the second floor, about 5-10 times of the second floor. I cannot figure out the reason, because the indoor lighting, equipment power and the occupant density are all the same for the two floors.
In my opinion, the second floor should have a higher air-conditioning load than the first floor because it is the building's top floor. But the result is just the opposite.
I really want to know the reason and how I should deal with it.
Thanks

It's almost surely your first floor slab.  The default configuration and U-value for these constructions are usually very poor.

Thanks James.
But I'm afraid it is not that reason. I set the ground floor as adiabatic but the design air flow is still high, just very little lower compared to the previous one.

Hi all,

we are setting up a measurement campaign to check the air quality in
parking lots. So far, we found limited information regarding standards and
legislation.
We will be measuring particles of 17 nm to 10 micrometer and have the
particle size distributions dynamically.

Any information or studies on this topic are very welcome!

Is this a funded effort?

Five to ten times?  Check your occupancy carefully.  It sounds like 
outside air to me.  You either have no occupants on the second floor or 
ten times the occupants on the first floor.

I think I have known one of the reasons( if more than one).
I set a self-defined wall in the Wizard data edit mode, using the R value definition. However, the R value automatically became U value under Detailed data edit mode. So the roof heat conduction is very large. Besides, I set a ceiling in the second floor which exhaust the hot air out, so the roof conduction load in the second floor is zero. These settings caused the first floor load much larger than the second floor.

Hi, every body,


I now have a difficult problem. I found that the autosized design air flow in the first floor is much larger than the second floor, about 5-10 times of the second floor. I cannot figure out the reason, because the indoor lighting, equipment power and the occupant density are all the same for the two floors.
In my opinion, the second floor should have a higher air-conditioning load than the first floor because it is the building's top floor. But the result is just the opposite.
I really want to know the reason and how I should deal with it.

An extension of Robert?s advice:  Check your first floor?s inputs for increased infiltration loads the second floor does not have.  This behavior may be normal, considering doors/vestibules/windows.

I don?t think I?m totally following your exhaust strategy, but another general caution per your word choice:   You may not want to have a ?roof? on your first floor.  If you ultimately do have a  roof (exterior) surface sandwiched between your floors (easy mistake if you defined each floor as a separate shell), you have possibly nearly doubled your roof loads for the building.  Much further discussion on this and how to handled inter-floor heat transfer in the archives, but planes sandwiched between shells should generally be either interior surfaces of some sort (air/framed/adiabatic), or deleted.

I think I have known one of the reasons( if more than one).
I set a self-defined wall in the Wizard data edit mode, using the R value definition. However, the R value automatically became U value under Detailed data edit mode. So the roof heat conduction is very large. Besides, I set a ceiling in the second floor which exhaust the hot air out, so the roof conduction load in the second floor is zero. These settings caused the first floor load much larger than the second floor.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] OA unit in EnergyPlus
Message-ID: <004b01ccf5fb$a54c9e00$efe5da00$@com>

Hello All,

 

I want to model OA in a zone with radiant floor cooling system in
EnergyPlus. Is it necessary to put an OA equipment as well, I only want OA
in my zone being supplied by a fan which is controlled on temperature reset.
I don't want to precondition the air. When I use Zone HVAC: OutdoorAirUnit,
it asks for a OA unit name and it is a required field. So, what component I
must use for this case?

 

Thanks,

Hallo!

I need to calculate the DGI for an office room. I know only RADIANCE as

(positon, inclination, an so on).

I would like to use a tool that can include thermal parameters like 
radiadion (W/m2).

Whick kind of software could I use?

You can model whatever size and shape you want as long as your area
weighted SHGC, and U-value are correct, and your shading is modeling
correctly.  Daylighting performance might be affected slightly, along with
passive solar performance, but I am fairly certain that the affect would
be very small compared with the annual building energy use.  If you're
genuinely curious, try it.  Model a couple of different scenarios, all
with the same total area, u-value, and SHGC, and see what happens.

When doing the LEED project, do I need to use the actual window shape, or
just keep the window-wall ratio in each direction?

I don't think the window shape will influence the energy cost if the
window-wall ratio is the same. But I don't know if the LEED reviewer care

Thanks a lot!

Hi Michaela!

As long as you are looking into radiation, you can stay with Radiance 
(just assign the wavelength ranges as needed to the - by default three - 
channels). If you need to handle other, non-radiative energy transfers, 
one option is to use ESP-r. This tool is a general building simulation 
software, with an integrated interface to Radiance for daylighting 
calculations.

Cheers, Lars.

Hello Esmireta,
In general, I would advise that you do your best to model the windows as are drawn on the architectural design documents. If your project has many many different window sizes, try to set up several typical types that best represent a set of window and frame dimensions.

Also, just keeping the WWR the same may not yield the same daylight distribution in the model. This would affect calculations for daylight dimming, too.

Good luck,

There would be a difference, for instance, if there were ten windows, 
all with metal frames, and you modeled that as one big window with ten 
times the area.  I wouldn't do that.  Maybe not important, but I 
wouldn't do it.

The soffit only comes into the question of there is an overhang, which 
is shading, and must be modeled if you want to take credit for it.

I think.

Message-ID: <BF1FB99E0691894F9DCB992DF4DFDE9F0A0DBFBB@chi01exmb.perkinswill.net>

I am working on a mixed use project that has offices, retail residential and higher education spaces in the mix. We are trying to estimate anticipated energy loads - both annual usage and peak demand for each space type (chilled water, steam, natural gas and electricity). I have reasonably good data from CBECS & LBNL on annual energy usage. The roadblock is in the peak demand numbers.

Does anyone know of a good [credible] published resource for peak demand numbers for these building types?

Thanks for your help

*ABOUT THE AIA ENERGY MODELING PRATICE GUIDE *

The American Institute of Architects*Practice Guide to 
Integrating Energy Modeling into the Design Process *has 
been developed to help bridge the gap between what 
architects and most engineers call ?Design? and what energy 
modelers call ?Geometry?. In many instances architects, 
engineers, energy modelers and our clients all speak 
different languages regarding the same subject. As the 
project design leader, who but the architect is best suited 
to manage the increasing complexity of high performance 
building design that includes energy as an equal design 
consideration? Architects need to feel empowered to know 
more on the subject of energy; what questions to ask, from 
initial project scope, through effective and ongoing team 
management, to communicate effectively on the subject and 
provide collaborative design leadership. To do this 
architects must take the time to gain a better understanding 
of assumptions and variables related to energy modeling, and 
a stronger knowledge of the appropriate tools and technology 
in the market that allow design teams to address energy 
through energy modeling early and throughout the design 
process.

The document being issued for peer review in March of 2012 
represents the *AIA Energy Modeling Working Group?s* best 
efforts to communicate this subject matter to architects and 
all members of the AIA family. It is the intent of the 
working group that this guide serve as a seminal document 
for AIA members to better understand the value, complexity 
and fun of embracing energy as a design topic, no matter 
what type of work you do. We hope this document, when 
published will encourage and empower architects to better 
understand how to incorporate energy modeling early and 
often in the design process.

All of the vendor provided sizing software for hot water is aimed at 
daily use, not peak.  "Recovery Time" is usually provided for hot water and

that can be flipped over to give a good estimate of peak use, but only 
for hot water.

In fact the fairly-early-in-the-day demand for hot water in K-12 
education food service limits the effectiveness of Solar Thermal systems 
somewhat.

Hi Vikram,

CEUS (California Commercial End Use Survey: ) is a credible, citable report
that has simulated electricity demand curves for different building types
(small/large office, college, retail, etc. It doesn't cover residential).
Since CEUS was developed for utility demand forecasting the curves
represent aggregate demand for an entire utility zone and statewide, but
you might be able to tease out values for a typical building by using EUI
and other information from the report. There is a TON of information in
this report, but it is all California-centric so I'm not sure how
applicable it will be to your case. Here's a link to the report, the demand
curves start on page 169: http://www.energy.ca.gov/ceus/.

Good luck,

Sam

I have modeled cases like this both ways and will continue to approach them leaving options open.

Sometimes a combined area of windows is an acceptable approximation, and sometimes it is not.  It very much depends on the purpose and intent of the model (notably, what degree of accuracy is expected of the envelope).

One can have a self-imposed 'standard' and that's fine (I personally choose to regularly do/avoid some things it might be weird to expect others to do/avoid), but in the end such approximations are the call of the person constructing the model.  All such choices may be fairly made on a case-by-case basis if you are comfortable doing so and justifying your choices.

In the case of a LEED model, I would personally match the actual window layout in normal practice, and in doing so match the actual framing perimeter sums.  That said, I think LEED (really, 90.1 Appendix G) is intentionally constructed to permit a range of choices in this regard.  If you're made to approximate windows by combining their areas for whatever reason (I can think of a few good ones), provided your baseline has a matching layout you've maintained a level playing field and should be able to sleep easy at night =).

If your absolute concern is modeled accuracy of the envelope/glazing systems (read: not necessarily a LEED performance rating model) - certainly you should pay close mind to the actual framing areas and developed lengths for all the reasons discussed so far.

Daylighting performance might be affected slightly, along with passive solar performance, but I am fairly certain that the affect would be very small compared with the annual building energy use.  If you're genuinely curious, try it.  Model a couple of different scenarios, all with the same total area, u-value, and SHGC, and see what happens.

Hi Esmireta,

I'm not sure about what LEED requires, but I would be aware that in addition to Window-Wall Ratio, you should also consider Glass-Frame ratio. Depending on the software and method that you model windows, two 3'x5' windows with a 1" frame are NOT the same as one 6'x5' window (the 6'x5' would have two vertical components, whereas the two 3'x5' would have four vertical components). I'm not sure a LEED reviewer would notice the difference, but I think best practice is to include the correct frame area in your model.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Do I need to use the actual window shape?

When doing the LEED project, do I need to use the actual window shape, or just keep the window-wall ratio in each direction?
I don't think the window shape will influence the energy cost if the window-wall ratio is the same. But I don't know if the LEED reviewer care about it.
Thanks a lot!

Does anybody know a SHGC for "Opaque" windows?  I think they painted 
them black.

I don't think "0.00" is appropriate, but I'm willing to listen to reason...

Hi Robert,



If it's an opaque window, can't it be described as a construction/wall material? Why still define it as a window?

Hi Robert

Usually different building codes (BCA in Australia, as an example)
define windows as 'a device which transmits natural light directly from
the outside'. If you have an 'opaque' system this probably can not be
treated as a 'window'.

SHGC is '0' for any non-transparent/non-translucent systems including
'opaque windows'.

All,

The Commercial Building Energy Modeler Job/Task Analysis validation survey that Kristin mentioned in her post below is still open - survey response rates have been below what is required to proceed with publication of the final document. Ideally, we would like at least 100 individual responses; to date only 49 practitioners have taken the time to reply!

Given the great interest shown by this group for the project last year, I am appealing to you to help further the U.S. commercial building energy modeling workforce. This is your last opportunity to provide input before this important document is published. The survey should take no more than 20 minutes; survey instructions can be found at http://www.nrel.gov/buildings/workforce.html.  Thank you in advance.

Sincerely,
Danny Studer

All,

After the discussion that occurred late last year regarding NREL's Commercial Building Energy Modeler Job/Task Analysis, I thought some of you might be interested to know that the document is now out for survey validation (see http://www.nrel.gov/buildings/workforce.html). It looks like this step is where the task weighting factors come from, but the website gives more information. Just thought some of you might be interested in providing responses.

Cheers,
Kristin

Strictly speaking, every construction (window or wall) has a non-zero SHGC. A portion of absorbed solar radiation will ultimately end up inside a space (via conduction through the surface and later radiation/convection into the space). A highly insulated wall will transmit a negligible amount of energy. The ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals (Fenestration chapter) provides a method for calculating the SHGC of window frames. 
For your opaque windows, the transmittance may be zero, but the SHGC > 0. The magnitude will depend on the construction of the "window"; with higher U-values leading to a higher SHGC. 
Why not use LBNL Window software to calculate it? I ran the following tests with opaque glass and clear glass. Here are the results:Plain opaque glass: SHGC = 0.31Opaque outside, air, Clear inside: SHGC = 0.16Clear outside, air, Opaque inside: SHGC = 0.5

If you do decide to use WINDOW 6 to generate the SHGC, you can export an
Energy Plus input "snippet" in IDF format from the Window Library, Reports
button. Make the glazing system, then create a window using that glazing
system, and then you can generate the E+ IDF file for that window / glazing
system / frame system.
