DesignBuilder/EnergyPlus Training

DesignBuilder is a state-of-the-art whole building energy analysis software tool for evaluating building energy, carbon, lighting and comfort performance. Developed to simplify the process of building simulation, DesignBuilder allows you to rapidly compare the function and performance of building designs and deliver results on time and on budget.

The training will be run using version 4 of DesignBuilder and will cover many of the new and enhanced features such as the new geometric modeler with enhanced block geometry editing, the ability to mirror blocks, add individual surfaces, and produce cut-away/section visualizations. Version 4 can produce ASHRAE 90.1 standards compliant baseline models required of various credit and certification programs including LEED, IRS, etc.

The training is suitable for new and experienced users alike. It is fully modular so that people can attend just one or any number of the days. 

The course is organized so that architects could attend only the first 2-3 days and the last 2 days are specific to engineers. The focus on day 3 is low energy and passive design modelling and it would therefore be valuable for both architects and engineers.

Locations & Dates

*	Durham, North Carolina; May 11-15, 2015 
*	San Francisco, California; September 21-25, 2015 

Discounts are available for students/researchers/faculty and multiple company attendees booking 4 or more days. 

Space is limited so we encourage early registration.

Additional course information and registration <http://designbuilderusa.com/training/designbuilder-simulation-training-days> .

Don't miss this opportunity to be trained in the easiest to use, most powerful graphical user interface to EnergyPlus available and includes ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G Baseline HVAC System templates, materials, and construction libraries.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED/Appendix G - Laboratory Question
Message-ID: <0EA9E4A184B01D468EA29CEFC03EA58F013ED231@SBS1.DesignEngineersPC.local>

Hi all,

I have a question related to modeling a laboratory building via Appendix G methodology for LEED 2009.  I have an inclination as to the answer based on my experience using Appendix G, but I'm looking to cite the specific section(s)/argument as to whether or not the following would be allowed:

It is common practice for lab buildings to utilize one mechanical system type throughout the building to maintain flexibility for conversion of spaces between offices and labs and vice versa.  These buildings therefore rely on a 100% exhaust system in all spaces no matter the function.  Our building's proposed design makes a conscientious energy efficiency decision to reduce exhaust air and associated makeup by installing a second mechanical system (not 100% exhaust) type to serve these office areas.  This design decision also comes with additional first costs (another mechanical system), and hence should be considered an energy efficiency strategy of the proposed building.

Is it allowed for the baseline and proposed energy models to consider different exhaust requirements for the systems serving the office areas, the baseline's requiring a 100% exhaust system, while the proposed building's does not?

There may be other more relevant sections to coming up with a correction interpretation on this, but so far, I've noted that 90.1-2007 Section 6.5.7.2 provides an exception for energy recovery for a. VAV hood exhaust and room supply systems capable of reducing exhaust and makeup air volume to 50% or less of design values.  This to me suggests and confirms that the base system would be one that is a 100% exhaust type.

I am very interested to know if anyone has direct experience applying this same/similar logic in LEED models, or has learned of an interpretation that is acceptable by ASHRAE & LEED.

Joe,

I have always modeled lab spaces with a separate system for the baseline
design according to section G3.1.1 ( exception c or d). In this case lab
spaces will have a separate system than the rest of the building (office
spaces).  The ventilation rate shall be the same in both cases (G3.1.2.5)
until additional controls are provided for the proposed design (CO sensors,
DCV ventilation, or any specific controls that are not described in section
6 of the ASHRAE 90.1).
The baseline design shall be modeled meeting all mandatory and prescriptive
options of section 6.  If  90.1-2007 Section 6.5.7.2 provides an exception
for energy recovery, then it should be modeled in the Baseline Design too.
If you provide more energy efficiency controls that are not described in
section 6 and appendix G, then you can take a credit for the Proposed
Design. For example you reduce air to 75% or 100% during unoccupied hours ,
but in the baseline design you reduce it only to 50% as G 3.1.1 exception d
says or section 6.5.7.2

I hope my understanding helps you.  But I would like to know other opinions
too, and if it is any exceptional cases are possible.


Thanks,

 *Genia Gorbachinsky, LEED GA*

I agree with Genia - you should probably model a separate air handler for offices and Labs (in the baseline).

Another strategy sometimes used in Lab buildings is to cascade the airflow from the offices to the labs. Generally the ventilation requirements for Labs are exhaust based (if you need 10 air changes  - that's saying you need to exhaust 10 air changes). Your supply can be a combination of fresh air and makeup air from the offices. This will actually reduce the overall outside air used (more than 2 separate air handlers) - your total fresh air intake = lab exhaust, whereas in the two air handler situation your total fresh air intake = lab exhaust+ ventilation requirements for the office.

"Title 24 compliance modeling paths and software have undergone major changes with the 2013 Energy Standards. These changes have created considerable confusion among building professionals and new challenges for energy modelers. What is actually required under the 2013 Standards? What software is approved for compliance? What are the various capabilities of different approved software? How have experienced modelers implemented new steps and processes, changing their work flow to assess loads, design systems, and document compliance? Design and energy modeling practitioners will describe and discuss their workflow under the 2013 Standards, sharing their experiences of what's worked and what has not. Come prepared to ask questions and share your own experiences in what should be an informative discussion!"

Looking forward to your participation!

Dear All,
We are working on a project with MERV 16 filters used in AHU. For the baseline case, pressure drop adjustment should be added and the description for the same is "calculate Pressure drop calculated at 2? clean filter pressure drop at fan system design condition". It would be very helpful if some one can explain what exactly that means and what has to be considered in base case fan power calculations.
Regards,Rathnashree?

Rathna,
Assuming the you are referring to an ASHRAE 90.1 Baseline, fan power is
unchanged except that you can claim a fan pressure credit.  That is what
you appear to be referring to.
Each filter manufacturer will show pressure drop for a specific face
velocity.  In the US, a typical face velocity is about 500 feet / min.
If the manufacturer filter pressure drop is .3" at 500 fpm (and the design
velocity is also 500 feet / min), then you can use 0.6" as your pressure
credit.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Call for Nominations for IBPSA Student Travel Awards
Message-ID: <92B4D0F578AB284AAD350E3D3C74795C498D338C@TIS104.uopnet.plymouth.ac.uk>

This is a reminder of the Call for Nominations for the IBPSA Student Travel Awards.
As this Award Cycle is aligned with the submission of the papers for BS2015, we are matching the extended deadline of 15 May 2015.


Student Travel Awards - Supporting students to attend BS2015

Travel to IBPSA Conferences can be an expensive business - especially for students. In order to assist as many students as possible to participate in BS 2015 in Hyderabad, India, IBPSA will grant a number of travel awards of up to 1000USD to students presenting papers. The number of places is limited to a maximum of 5 grants and as a result is highly competitive.

The selection committee bases its decisions upon the following selection criteria:

*           need for financial assistance, evidenced in a letter of recommendation from the student's supervisor/ advisor of studies (must be on university letterhead);

*           overall quality of the paper;

*           relevance of contribution to the field of and/or furthering the effective application of building simulation.


To be eligible, the student must be:

*           enrolled in a graduate programme related to building simulation at the time of the conference; AND

*           the thesis project must be directly related to building simulation.

Applications MUST be supported by a letter of recommendation from the student's supervisor/ advisor / director of studies.
Applications for the award must be made by 15 May, 2015 (same date as the deadline for full paper submission) via e-mail to pieter.dewilde at plymouth.ac.uk. The subject heading of the e-mail should be "Student Travel Award" followed by the name of the student.

The e-mail application must include the following:
       The student's name;
       The name of the programme, department, faculty, and university;
       The title of the PhD or Master's research;
       The name of the student's supervisor(s)/ advisor(s);
       The faculty recommendation letter on university letterhead in PDF format.

The selection committee will base its decision upon a review of the letters of support and the final manuscripts. Therefore, to be eligible the student MUST submit the paper by the full paper deadline of 15 May, 2015.

IBPSA would like as many nominations as possible, so please contact the chair of the Awards and Fellows Committee, Pieter de Wilde, via pieter.dewilde at plymouth.ac.uk to discuss a possible nomination if required.

Payment will be made either to the academic department before the conference or directly to the student at the conference.

East Coast USA training registration underway.


Don't miss this opportunity to be trained in the easiest to use/learn, most powerful building energy performance tool available.


DesignBuilder is an elegant, seamless integration of building energy performance tools encompassing the totality of building energy use, including whole building energy simulation, daylighting and internal/external CFD (computational fluid dynamics).

Suitable for both residential and commercial applications, DesignBuilder was the first graphical user interface (GUI) to EnergyPlus, the 'gold standard' for whole building energy simulation. With more than ten years of development invested, DesignBuilder is the building energy performance tool of choice for today's architects and engineers.

Developed to simplify the process of building simulation, DesignBuilder allows you to rapidly compare the function and performance of building designs and deliver early stage thru final results on time and on budget. Unlike other products that generate results that are broad and indefinite, or do not address daylighting or airflow and 3-D temperature distribution data in and around buildings, DesignBuilder provides a total solution with data results you can have complete confidence in.

The training will be run using version 4 of DesignBuilder and will cover many of the new and enhanced features such as the new geometric modeler with enhanced block geometry editing, the ability to mirror blocks, add individual surfaces, and produce cut-away/section visualizations. Version 4 can produce ASHRAE 90.1 standards compliant baseline models required of various certification and credit programs including LEED, IRS, etc.

The training is suitable for new and experienced users alike. It is fully modular so that people can attend just one or any number of the days.

The course is organized so that architects could attend only the first 2-3 days and the last 2 days are specific to engineers. The focus on day 3 is low energy and passive design modelling and it would therefore be valuable for both architects and engineers.

Locations & Dates

*	Durham, North Carolina; May 11-15, 2015
*	San Francisco, California; September 21-25, 2015

Discounts are available for students/researchers/faculty and multiple company attendees booking 4 or more days.

Space is limited so we encourage early registration.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED v4 and process loads - commercial kitchens
Message-ID: <25F861E695EA99478F9790869A57C7D41BDB41E7@catormsx02>

I have an office building project with a large commercial kitchen.  I am looking for guidance on modeling the energy consumption and the heat gains/losses.

All the kitchen equipment cut sheets have been provided so I know the peak loads but I am not sure of how to construct operating schedules for the times of peak loads and the times of idling for the equipment.

Then I have to use the LEED v4 Appendix 3 to determine the baseline peak and idle rates.

Can anyone point to studies of actual commercial kitchen energy use?  Does anyone have some general rules of thumb for modeling this kind of issue?

As always, thanks for your insights.

DesignBuilder USA training registration underway.


Don't miss this opportunity to be trained in the easiest to use/learn, most powerful building energy performance tool available.


DesignBuilder is an elegant, seamless integration of building energy performance tools encompassing the totality of building energy use, including whole building energy simulation, daylighting and internal/external CFD (computational fluid dynamics). Suitable for both residential and commercial applications, DesignBuilder was the first graphical user interface (GUI) to EnergyPlus, the 'gold standard' for whole building energy simulation. With more than ten years of development invested, DesignBuilder is the building energy performance tool of choice for today's architects and engineers.

Developed to simplify the process of building simulation, DesignBuilder allows you to rapidly compare the function and performance of building designs and deliver early stage thru final results on time and on budget. Unlike other products that generate results that are broad and indefinite, or do not address daylighting or airflow and 3-D temperature distribution data in and around buildings, DesignBuilder provides a total solution with data results you can have complete confidence in.

The training will be run using version 4 of DesignBuilder and will cover many of the new and enhanced features such as the new geometric modeler with enhanced block geometry editing, the ability to mirror blocks, add individual surfaces, and produce cut-away/section visualizations. Version 4 can produce ASHRAE 90.1 standards compliant baseline models required of various certification and credit programs including LEED, IRS, etc.

The training is suitable for new and experienced users alike. It is fully modular so that people can attend just one or any number of the days.

The course is organized so that architects could attend only the first 2-3 days and the last 2 days are specific to engineers. The focus on day 3 is low energy and passive design modelling and it would therefore be valuable for both architects and engineers.

Locations & Dates

*	Durham, North Carolina; May 11-15, 2015
*	San Francisco, California; September 21-25, 2015

Discounts are available for students/researchers/faculty and multiple company attendees booking 4 or more days.

Space is limited so we encourage early registration.

Dear All,

We are working on a national level research project in India. A building
envelope analysis is a part of this project. By doing analysis, we have
found a vague results in trend (linearly downward) of reduction in energy
consumption with reducing wall U-value in eQUEST.

Theoretically, the energy consumption should approach to stagnant with
reduction in wall U-value.

Please refer figure.

Appreciate if anyone put light on this.

Thank you.

Mayank,

I think we need to know a bit more about the building:
- Location (some parts of India are cool, others hot!)
- Building usage - office, domestic, retail? Hours of use?
- Servicing - heating and cooling? Mechanical or natural vent?

Hi Claire,

Thanks for your response.

The analysis has been done on an 8 hour operating office building in New
Delhi. The mechanical system is packaged single zone system with electric
resistance heating.

Please let me know if you need more information.

Thanks

Regards,
Mayank

The results look reasonably close to those expected but that you haven't
reached the far enough down the curve yet to see it stagnating? Either that
or there are some other factors in the model which become more less
significant with reducing U-value?

Anil,
Adding a Dummy zone you can try by putting it as Unit Ventilator and make the heating source as "not installed". Assign the fan schedule and input Design supply fan .....kw/cfm in fan  power parameters.

Subject: [Equest-users] Fresh Air Unit supply fan power

Hi, Everyone,

I'm modeling a VRF system with 30% extra fresh air as per ASHRAE standards. The building has a Fresh Air Unit (without cooling coil and Heat recovery wheels) which is supplying calculated amount of fresh air to VRF indoor units.
As the Fresh Air Unit does not have cooling coil and heat recovery wheels, entire cooling load of fresh air will be taken care by VRF indoor units.

I am doubtful about the Fresh Air Unit supply fan power. How should I model the fan power of Fresh Air Unit supply fan? Should I break the fan power and add it with the VRF indoor unit fan power as per the fresh air fraction provided in that VRF unit?

Thanks in advance!

Regards,

Anil Jangid
Project Engineer

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Please sign an open letter of support for NREL's weather
 and solar radiation efforts
Message-ID: <553A57ED.1060102@whiteboxtechnologies.com>

Ever since I started doing building energy simulations in the early 
1980's, I have always relied upon NREL's TMY weather files for US 
locations.  Over the years, NREL has led the way in improving the data 
quality as well as coverage of weather files.  Before the TMY2s, how 
many of us thought that weather files should be self-describing, and 
before the TMY3s, how many thought it was possible to have TMY files for 
over 1,000 US locations?

Therefore, when I was contacted recently by Dr. Manajit Sengupta of NREL 
to provide a letter of support for their proposal to DOE on continued 
funding of their work on solar radiation,  I said of course, but then 
suggested that someone should point out to DOE Solar that the  whole 
building  energy community has been heavily reliant on NREL's weather data.

After discussions with several organizations in which I'm involved, I've 
concluded the best way to convey this message is to provide NREL a 
letter of support signed by individuals, rather than in the name of any 
organization. I have now written such an Open Letter that I am posting 
on bulletin boards such as this one (see following and also here).  If 
you wish to add your name in support of this Open Letter, please go to 
http://weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com/support-NREL .   I will be 
accepting names through Monday, after which I will close the sign-up 
list and send the letter to NREL.

I want to be clear that this is an individual effort, and its appearance 
on this bulletin board does not imply any endorsement by the bulletin 
board, nor of the organizations with which any of the signatories are 
affiliated.

Re: Letter of Support for NREL's proposal to SunShot

National Laboratory Multiyear Partnership

Dear Dr. Sengupta,

We the undersigned wish to express our support to NREL's research 
proposal titled "Solar Resource Calibration, Measurement and Dissemination".

As engineers and architects dedicated to the design and operation of 
energy efficient buildings, andas researchers and consultants in the 
field of building energy simulations, we've relied heavily on the 
meteorological data that has been developed by NREL going back to the 
1970?s, including the various versions ofthe Typical Meteorological Year 
(TMY) weather files and the National Solar Radiation Data Base (NSRDB), 
as well as other climatological data summaries. We especially look 
forward to seeing the outcome several aspect of your proposal pertaining 
to the following areas:

?Maintenance and upgrading of the Renewable Resource Data Center (RReDC)

?Maintenance and upgrading of the National Solar Radiation Data Base 
(NSRDB), in particular the new datasets using satellite based models 
providing accurate grid-based solar data for any location in the United 
States (as well as international locations if possible).

?Updated and expanded coverage of TMY data sets incorporating the 
above-mentioned solar radiation data.

?Continuing your research work that is crucial to new ASHRAE standards 
in climate zone definitions and energy efficiency standards.

?We perceive high value in NREL's updating of its best practice handbook 
on solarresources for solar energy application as a participant in IEA 
Task 46.

We believe that continued work by NREL in this proposal is unique and 
extremely beneficial to the work that we undertake todesign, construct, 
and operatemore energy-efficient buildings, and improve our ability to 
analyze building energy performance. Furthermore, the proposed work also 
supports other major efforts being undertaken in the setting of building 
energy performance standards, rating systems, and incentive programs by 
other organizations such as DOE, ASHRAE, or various utility companies.

Sincerely,

[please give your name, affiliations, and e-mail address]note thatthe 
affiliation s are purely for identification, and do not imply their 
endorsement of this letter, and that e-mail addresses are for my record 
keeping and will not appear in the letter of support.

Two weeks remaining to register. Seats still available for East Coast USA training.


Don't miss this opportunity to be trained in the easiest to use/learn, most powerful building energy performance tool available.


DesignBuilder is an elegant, seamless integration of building energy performance tools encompassing the totality of building energy use, including whole building energy simulation, daylighting and internal/external CFD (computational fluid dynamics).

Suitable for both residential and commercial applications, DesignBuilder was the first graphical user interface (GUI) to EnergyPlus, the 'gold standard' for whole building energy simulation. With more than ten years of development invested, DesignBuilder is the building energy performance tool of choice for today's architects and engineers.

Developed to simplify the process of building simulation, DesignBuilder allows you to rapidly compare the function and performance of building designs and deliver early stage thru final results on time and on budget. Unlike other products that generate results that are broad and indefinite, or do not address daylighting or airflow and 3-D temperature distribution data in and around buildings, DesignBuilder provides a total solution with data results you can have complete confidence in.

The training will be run using version 4 of DesignBuilder and will cover many of the new and enhanced features such as the new geometric modeler with enhanced block geometry editing, the ability to mirror blocks, add individual surfaces, and produce cut-away/section visualizations. Version 4 can produce ASHRAE 90.1 standards compliant baseline models required of various certification and credit programs including LEED, IRS, etc.

The training is suitable for new and experienced users alike. It is fully modular so that people can attend just one or any number of the days.

The course is organized so that architects could attend only the first 2-3 days and the last 2 days are specific to engineers. The focus on day 3 is low energy and passive design modelling and it would therefore be valuable for both architects and engineers.

Locations & Dates

*	Durham, North Carolina; May 11-15, 2015
*	San Francisco, California; September 21-25, 2015

Discounts are available for students/researchers/faculty and multiple company attendees booking 4 or more days.

Space is limited so we encourage early registration.

Interesting but mysterious. I can tell that he's pissed off about
something about the new guidelines, but not what, or why.

Seems unfortunate that he feels removing useful info is the right

About Transsolar

Who we are
Transsolar is an international climate engineering firm determined to create exceptional, highly comfortable indoor and outdoor spaces with a positive environmental impact. We believe that the very measures taken to create remarkable architecture can simultaneously enhance human experience and minimize resource use. To us, sustainability is not separate from design, but an indispensable component that enhances the experience of the built environment.

What we do
We are vision facilitators, idea generators, and design integrators.  Our engineers are not just experts in basic physical principles; their creativity enables the collaboration necessary to develop deeply integrated comfort and energy concepts.  Beginning from a project?s earliest conception, we work alongside the client, architect, design team, and the most vital participants of all ? the occupants. We study the seasonal behavior of sun, wind, heat, light and other energy flows in and around the building, and formulate concepts based on the complex interdependence of the local climate, user needs, architectural design and engineered systems. Our toolbox is ever-growing with simulation models, custom software, tailored engineering analysis, and physical experiments used to develop and validate these ideas.

What we offer
We believe that the built environment is more than the physical building. Our approach explores all factors affecting the occupant experience - including their variation in time and space.  Indoors or outdoors, a climate is continually changing. We respond with dynamic solutions that work with this natural variability, not against it.  While we are constantly developing new technologies and finding innovative applications, we recognize that technology alone is not the answer. We are pioneers in implementing passive design strategies, and pride ourselves in their application in built, significant projects, both large and small.

Our product is a process. We ask difficult questions, challenge convention and propose new solutions, and thoroughly test ideas. Each project requires both sharing our knowledge and generating new ideas ? ultimately creating unique experiences, but always achieving the same goal: High Comfort, Low Impact.

Re-imagined website at www.transsolar.com<http://www.transsolar.com> launching soon!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] ASHRAE 90.1 and Vacancy Sensors
Message-ID: <6B99CA6125A7AB48997CF926E3D954DCFD52@FTWMSG11.jacobs.com>

All,
I've come across an interesting problem on a project.  I'm modeling a building using App. G for LEED V3 submission (ASHRAE 90.1-2007 baseline).  The building was actually designed to comply with most provisions of 90.1-2013 however.  Most of our spaces employ "vacancy" sensors (automatic off after 30 min, manual on control) rather that occupancy sensors (automatic off after 30 min, automatic on control) for lighting control.  As many of you are probably aware, 90.1-2007 App. G allows us to take a 10% savings (Table G3.2) on the LPD (it's well over 5,000 ft2).  90.1-2010 App. G allows the same reductions in lighting power but 2013 leaves it out since it's now required by the standard in most instances.

My understanding from SSPC 90.1 proceedings is that the committee determined that vacancy sensors save more energy than occupancy sensors (as they reduce false ons from transient movement).  I'm not sure how these savings are being estimated because predicting occupancy patterns is always fraught with assumptions.  Anyway, does anyone know if there is any guidance on claiming more than the standard 10% for occupancy sensors with these type of controls?  I'd like to avoid performing an exceptional calculation measure if possible so any 90.1 or LEED Interpretations would be really useful.

Thanks,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] App G Wall boundary condition when abutting an adjacent
	building
Message-ID: <CAEqKKtwCcOnLotATiwvCsuWTbWz4+Hmy-hMUSiUWStWzWrvKkw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Considering this is a software agnostic question, I thought I would ask it
to bldg-sim.


*I'm wondering how people have been treating the walls between the modeled
building and any adjacent, existing, buildings it's abutting in the
proposed design, when doing New Construction, especially with ASHRAE
Appendix G*

For EB and retrofit, there's no question, I'll treat it as adiabatic,
unless I have thorough reasons to believe the next door building is or will
be soon empty or even knocked down.

For New Construction, I'm a little bit more confused, especially
considering you're supposed to rotate your building for the baseline...

If I were to go crazy down that path: if I treat it as adiabatic, does this
mean I'd have to rotate the building manually, see what end ups in contact
with the adjacent building, and remove the windows there, while setting the
former adiabatic portion to exterior wall?

Here's an example of a project I'm working on right now (my building is 32
stories, the abutting are about 12 stories):

[image: My building is abutting three buildings]

*So what say you, fellow modelers?*

   -
*Do you treat it as adiabatic? *
   - *If so, do you include that wall area in calculating the Window to
   Wall Ratio?*
   - *Do you rotate the building?*

*Do you have any sources for claiming one or another?* (ASHRAE
interpretation, LEED credit interpretation).


My personal two cents:

- I treat it as adiabatic

- Per Table G3.1.5a, "If it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the
Program Evaluator that the building orientation is dictated by site
considerations" ==> I don't rotate the building

- I don't include the adiabatic walls in the WWR calculation as I think the
intent was like this, though 90.1-2010 Table G3.1.5c (Baseline) does only
say: "...gross above-grade wall area" which could be interpreted otherwise.

Original question on Unmet hours is here
<https://unmethours.com/question/4709/wall-boundary-condition-when-abutting-an-adjacent-building>


Thanks for any insights,

Best,

Julien

I did some research on this topic a few years back, as our local utility
was interested in providing a higher level of rebates for vacancy sensors.
I found a white paper that showed the Title 24 research into this topic.
It showed an 11% increase (on average) in savings for vacancy sensors vs
standard occupancy sensors. I will have to see if I can dig the paper up,
though you might find it with a little googling.  Anyways, that +11% is is
now written into our utility's modeling protocol for energy savings
calculations.

If you can find a white paper dated within 5 years, you can use it as the
basis for an Exceptional Calculation, but you will also have to show that
using vacancy sensors is NOT the design standard in your area.  (If it's in
your local code, it won't fly with LEED.)

Good luck!

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] ASHRAE 90.1 and Vacancy Sensors

I did some research on this topic a few years back, as our local utility was interested in providing a higher level of rebates for vacancy sensors.  I found a white paper that showed the Title 24 research into this topic.  It showed an 11% increase (on average) in savings for vacancy sensors vs standard occupancy sensors. I will have to see if I can dig the paper up, though you might find it with a little googling.  Anyways, that +11% is is now written into our utility's modeling protocol for energy savings calculations.

If you can find a white paper dated within 5 years, you can use it as the basis for an Exceptional Calculation, but you will also have to show that using vacancy sensors is NOT the design standard in your area.  (If it's in your local code, it won't fly with LEED.)

Good luck!

All,
I?ve come across an interesting problem on a project.  I?m modeling a building using App. G for LEED V3 submission (ASHRAE 90.1-2007 baseline).  The building was actually designed to comply with most provisions of 90.1-2013 however.  Most of our spaces employ ?vacancy? sensors (automatic off after 30 min, manual on control) rather that occupancy sensors (automatic off after 30 min, automatic on control) for lighting control.  As many of you are probably aware, 90.1-2007 App. G allows us to take a 10% savings (Table G3.2) on the LPD (it?s well over 5,000 ft2).  90.1-2010 App. G allows the same reductions in lighting power but 2013 leaves it out since it?s now required by the standard in most instances.

My understanding from SSPC 90.1 proceedings is that the committee determined that vacancy sensors save more energy than occupancy sensors (as they reduce false ons from transient movement).  I?m not sure how these savings are being estimated because predicting occupancy patterns is always fraught with assumptions.  Anyway, does anyone know if there is any guidance on claiming more than the standard 10% for occupancy sensors with these type of controls?  I?d like to avoid performing an exceptional calculation measure if possible so any 90.1 or LEED Interpretations would be really useful.

Thanks,

Hi Julien,



1.       Adiabatic makes sense if you can assert they?re similarly
conditioned structures

2.       I?d exclude such shared walls for the purposes of determining WWR

3.       If you frame the adjacent abutting properties as ?existing
envelope conditions? precluding the design team from choosing any other
orientation, you might be able to cite CI #5224 as precedent to avoid the
rotation issues altogether:
http://in.usgbc.org/leed-interpretations?keys=5224+&=Search.  I might try
that first for preliminary submission, carefully citing that CI and
explaining the lack of rotations on the EAp2 template, within the 1.4
tables spreadsheet, and optionally within any supplemental narrative/report
you may include with preliminary submissions, if that?s your thing.



That explanation puts the issue on the table for the reviewer to agree with
or otherwise respond to.  In the event you are made to perform rotations
for final submission,  I wouldn?t ?go nuts? or do anything special beyond
simply rotating the entire model unless given specific further direction by
the reviewer in preliminary review commentary.



On the other hand, maybe someone ?in the know? will chime in on or off-list
for you ;)? it?s been known to happen!



Regards,



~Nick

adjacent building



Hi,

Considering this is a software agnostic question, I thought I would ask it
to bldg-sim.

*I'm wondering how people have been treating the walls between the modeled
building and any adjacent, existing, buildings it's abutting in the
proposed design, when doing New Construction, especially with ASHRAE
Appendix G*

For EB and retrofit, there's no question, I'll treat it as adiabatic,
unless I have thorough reasons to believe the next door building is or will
be soon empty or even knocked down.

For New Construction, I'm a little bit more confused, especially
considering you're supposed to rotate your building for the baseline...

If I were to go crazy down that path: if I treat it as adiabatic, does this
mean I'd have to rotate the building manually, see what end ups in contact
with the adjacent building, and remove the windows there, while setting the
former adiabatic portion to exterior wall?

Here's an example of a project I'm working on right now (my building is 32
stories, the abutting are about 12 stories):

[image: My building is abutting three buildings]

*So what say you, fellow modelers?*

   - *Do you treat it as adiabatic? *
   - *If so, do you include that wall area in calculating the Window to
   Wall Ratio?*
   - *Do you rotate the building?*

*Do you have any sources for claiming one or another?* (ASHRAE
interpretation, LEED credit interpretation).



My personal two cents:

- I treat it as adiabatic

- Per Table G3.1.5a, "If it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the
Program Evaluator that the building orientation is dictated by site
considerations" ==> I don't rotate the building

- I don't include the adiabatic walls in the WWR calculation as I think the
intent was like this, though 90.1-2010 Table G3.1.5c (Baseline) does only
say: "...gross above-grade wall area" which could be interpreted otherwise.

Original question on Unmet hours is here
<https://unmethours.com/question/4709/wall-boundary-condition-when-abutting-an-adjacent-building>



Thanks for any insights,

Best,

Julien
