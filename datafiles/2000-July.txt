I am enjoying myself *immensely* in my current position, but I have too much 
work!  We are looking for additional people to help develop and deliver the 
new Atrium service from Honeywell.  One key person will eventually be my 
boss,  so I'm looking for some terrific candidates! <VBG>.  This really is 
the best job I have had in years, with a great team and a terrific 
supervisor.  The people joining now will have great impact on how we approach 
analysis of the great quantities of data already being gathered.  The 
foundation has been set with a large infrastructure investment --- meters, 
gateways, servers, databases, communications, drivers, analysis tools --- and 
now we need more people to help pull information from the data.

While this is not a simulation service, an good understanding of building 
operations and controls is required, coupled with significant data analysis 
skills, so I believe many building simulation engineers will be well-suited 
for one of these positions.

The people already involved bring extensive experience in the buildings 
energy field, in software architecture and design, in data-gathering and 
communications hardware, etc., so you'd be joining a high-powered team.  A 
significant number of team members have MS and PhD degrees, and I'd like to 
think that I've got pretty good credentials, too, if not an advanced degree.  
 (My background includes 4 years calibrating DOE-2 models to metered end-use 
data, several papers delivered at conferences such as ACEEE and ASHRAE, a 
little experience with building commissioning, and 6 years in performance 
contract engineering.  This all followed 12 years in Aerospace, mostly 
designing aircraft air conditioning systems.)

If you're looking for an exciting opportunity , an opportunity to be in the 
forefront in applying internet and e-business solutions to the 
energy-use-in-buildings field, please review the following position 
descriptions.  Two positions are described--the first is for the team lead 
position, and the second is for other well-qualified individuals with, like 
myself, a passion for data analysis.  The team lead will be located in 
Atlanta, and it is hoped to locate all the individuals for the other position 
there as well, but there may be opportunity for *very exceptional* candidates 
to live elsewhere.  Contact me with questions, or contact Sam Sandquist 
directly (see contact info below) to submit a resume or request additional 
information.

Does anybody know where I can get weather files for/near El Monte, CA
that would be compatible with DOE2?. I need historical data, not summary

data. Specifically, I need hourly data for 1999, and the year 2000 up to

date.

Thanks,
Darren Weiss

To: anyone interested in a NL/NL+FL/Benelux chapter of the
    International Building Performance Simulation Association

    Apologies for cross-posting


This is to make you aware of the above survey at
http://www.bwk.tue.nl/fago/ibpsa/

The main questions addressed in the survey are:

1.Which activities should and could be done by this regional
  IBPSA organization?

2.Should this region be constrained to The Netherlands, or would
  it be more sensible to co-operate with Flanders, or Belgium
  and perhaps Luxembourg? 

Thank you,

Jan Hensen
