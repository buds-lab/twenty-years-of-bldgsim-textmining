TITLE
LEED v4 Daylight Metrics and LightStanza: Daylight in the Cloud


DATE AND TIME
Fri, May 8, 2015 12:30 PM - 2:30 PM EDT


REGISTER
Register at http://www.performance.network


DESCRIPTION
Confused by the new LEED v4 daylight metrics? Looking for a new way of
analyzing daylight for your building design?

The first half explains the LEED v4 Daylight Credit (EQc7) and new metrics,
Annual Sunlight Exposure (ASE) and Spatial Daylight Autonomy (sDA) required
for compliance. Strengths, limitations, assumptions and controversy over
ASE and sDA will be discussed including why annual metrics necessary, what
the metrics mean in terms of daylight design, what qualities of daylighting
the metrics miss, and how blinds affect the score and experience of
daylight. New metrics will be compared with established annual metrics such
as Daylight Autonomy and Useful Daylight Illuminance. The seminar will go
beyond reciting formulas to helping you define metrics in meaningful terms
you can visualize, understand and use in your every-day practice.

The second half will introduce LightStanza, an innovative cloud-based
daylighting simulation software powered by Radiance. It allows users to
change materials and orientations in a flexible Web Application. Topics
will include model upload, running simulations, generating visual scores
and reports, renderings, annual metrics and glare analysis, and LEED
documentation.


ABOUT THE INSTRUCTOR
Daniel Glaser is the Founder and Principal of Light Foundry, LLC, a small
startup based in Boulder, CO producing LightStanza, an avant-garde
cloud-based tool for transforming how industry utilizes daylight
effectively in green-building design. Dr. Glaser synthesizes 20 years of
experience in information technology, environmental, and human-factors
research in this project. He is a member of the IESNA Daylight Metrics
committee and has spoken at various international daylighting and

Hey Nick,

Thanks for your answer!

I think we're on the same page as to what needs to be done, including doing
a simple rotation (which is equivalent to "rotating the entire city block"
as it's been suggested to me on Unmet Hours)

Unless anyone else has something different to offer, I'm just going to
assume this is the correct approach.

Cheers,
Julien

Dru,
On a similar note:
How active is the UAE chapter? I noticed that the link to them on the IBPSA.org page is dead.
Do you think they are open to morph into a larger Gulf chapter (GCC)?
The reason I ask is that I gave a lecture at KFUPM in Dammam last week and there was interest in starting such a chapter.
Thanks,
Fried

Message-ID: <CACXXVchAc_1MjtRW+9JBqaTy+PxQr-=Dozi1iJ_ydA=3G4S6VQ@mail.gmail.com>

LBNL released the Modelica Buildings library 2.0.0.

The following major additions have been done in version 2.0.0:

   - A CFD model that is embedded in a thermal zone has been added. This
   model is implemented in Buildings.Rooms.CFD. The CFD model is an
   implementation of the Fast Fluid Dynamics code that allows
   three-dimensional CFD inside a thermal zone, coupled to building heat
   transfer, HVAC components and feedback control loops.
   - A new package Buildings.Electrical has been added. This package allows
   studying buildings to electrical grid integration. It includes models
   for loads, transformers, cables, batteries, PV and wind turbines. Models
   exist for DC and AC systems with two- or three-phases that can be balanced
   and unbalanced. The models compute voltage, current, active and reactive
   power based on the quasi-stationary assumption or using the dynamic
   phasorial representation.
   - The new package Buildings.Controls.DemandResponse contains models for
   demand response simulation.
   - The new package Buildings.Controls.Predictors contains a data-driven
   model that predicts the electrical load of a building. The prediction
   can be done either using an average baseline or a linear regression with
   respect to outside temperature. For both, optionally a day-of adjustment
   can be made.


This release also improves various existing models.

For a detailed list of changes, see

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Domestic Hot Water Heaters With VRF
Message-ID: <CAMwih4aEubmnHSVSodet-xnv7iAPb9nc545nnXm_k=jwbOnYAA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Has anyone ever had any experience with modeling a VRF system with
individual hot water heaters tied into the refrigerant loop?

We are debating in the office how this would be handled by an energy
modeling program. In the summer you could produce almost free hot water and
reduce the condensing unit load. But in the winter you would either need
greatly oversized condensing units or auxiliary heat. I'm not aware of this
level of functionality in an energy modeling program with domestic hot
water heating. We are thinking you would need to perform some amount of
calculations by hand with outputs from an energy model...

Also, has anyone had any positive or negative experiences with this in
terms of performance and operations?

Thanks!

I haven't done this yet, but.....

   - The VRF object in EnergyPlus allows a water-cooled condenser.  I
   suspect you could connect that water loop to a water heater without
   difficulty and adjust the water loop pump power to zero, etc.  The E+ water
   heater allows two energy sources (water and gas, for example) so when
   winter rolls around, the gas can take over ... or something like that.
   - I have modeled VRF (prior to E+ having the capability) as a
   water-source heat pump system.  The condenser loop could pass through a
   water heater or heat exchanger and accomplish your goal. (If you use this
   approach, the heat pump COP must be very high so compressor power is
   ~zero.  The condenser loop chiller / heater must have efficiency curves
   that are similar to the VRF system)

Interesting idea!



Whatever simulation package you choose to leverage, I think you may
anticipate blazing a new trail to some extent.  I am unaware of any
purpose-built tools for simulating the specific task at hand.  If anyone
*would* know of such tools, it might be the R&D departments for
manufacturers pushing such combination systems
(Toshiba/Mitsubishi/others?).  If time is on your side, sending a query up
the manufacturer chain might be worth your while.



At present, if you should opt to utilize eQuest/DOE2 for your study, VRF
with heat recovery function (?free heating/cooling? via zonal transfer) can
be *approximated* via post-processing of the hourly outputs.  Having tread
this path a number of times for different building types and having studied
various published/unpublished guidance for such procedures (one can source
such guidance in attachments within the [equest-users] archives), what
you?re considering exploring with DHW could be relatively simply layered
into the post-processing efforts with a small set of extra assumptions (and
a fair effort to accurately schedule/quantify DHW loads within the
simulation).  I?d want to get all the cutsheets in front of me and to have
the equipment rep(s) for the basis of design at-hand to ensure appropriate
safety factors and assumptions of system behavior are addressed at the
outset of the study.



Agnostic to your simulation package preferences/decision:  Thinking out
loud and considering how the potential for savings may inverse with the
season, especially for a climate like KS where the seasonal swings are
sustained and pronounced, it would be worthwhile to establish whether the
SHW/VRF systems might be ?de-coupled? on a simple-seasonal or monitored
basis in a cost-effective / low-maintenance / buildable fashion.  If
feasible, I would plan to include quantifying the associated annual savings
potential for a simple ROI check with your results.



Let us know how it goes!

I haven't done this yet, but.....

   - The VRF object in EnergyPlus allows a water-cooled condenser.  I
   suspect you could connect that water loop to a water heater without
   difficulty and adjust the water loop pump power to zero, etc.  The E+ water
   heater allows two energy sources (water and gas, for example) so when
   winter rolls around, the gas can take over ... or something like that.
   - I have modeled VRF (prior to E+ having the capability) as a
   water-source heat pump system.  The condenser loop could pass through a
   water heater or heat exchanger and accomplish your goal. (If you use this
   approach, the heat pump COP must be very high so compressor power is
   ~zero.  The condenser loop chiller / heater must have efficiency curves
   that are similar to the VRF system)

Hi,



Has anyone ever had any experience with modeling a VRF system with
individual hot water heaters tied into the refrigerant loop?



We are debating in the office how this would be handled by an energy
modeling program. In the summer you could produce almost free hot water and
reduce the condensing unit load. But in the winter you would either need
greatly oversized condensing units or auxiliary heat. I'm not aware of this
level of functionality in an energy modeling program with domestic hot
water heating. We are thinking you would need to perform some amount of
calculations by hand with outputs from an energy model...



Also, has anyone had any positive or negative experiences with this in
terms of performance and operations?



Thanks!

This is a final reminder of the Call for Nominations for the IBPSA Student Travel Awards.
The deadline for nominations is 15 May 2015, matching the deadline for paper submission for BS2015.


Student Travel Awards - Supporting students to attend BS2015

Travel to IBPSA Conferences can be an expensive business - especially for students. In order to assist as many students as possible to participate in BS 2015 in Hyderabad, India, IBPSA will grant a number of travel awards of up to 1000USD to students presenting papers. The number of places is limited to a maximum of 5 grants and as a result is highly competitive.

The selection committee bases its decisions upon the following selection criteria:

*           need for financial assistance, evidenced in a letter of recommendation from the student's supervisor/ advisor of studies (must be on university letterhead);

*           overall quality of the paper;

*           relevance of contribution to the field of and/or furthering the effective application of building simulation.


To be eligible, the student must be:

*           enrolled in a graduate programme related to building simulation at the time of the conference; AND

*           the thesis project must be directly related to building simulation.

Applications MUST be supported by a letter of recommendation from the student's supervisor/ advisor / director of studies.
Applications for the award must be made by 15 May, 2015 (same date as the deadline for full paper submission) via e-mail to pieter.dewilde at plymouth.ac.uk<mailto:pieter.dewilde at plymouth.ac.uk>. The subject heading of the e-mail should be "Student Travel Award" followed by the name of the student.

The e-mail application must include the following:
        The student's name;
        The name of the programme, department, faculty, and university;
        The title of the PhD or Master's research;
        The name of the student's supervisor(s)/ advisor(s);
       The faculty recommendation letter on university letterhead in PDF format.

The selection committee will base its decision upon a review of the letters of support and the final manuscripts. Therefore, to be eligible the student MUST submit the paper by the full paper deadline of 15 May, 2015.

IBPSA would like as many nominations as possible, so please contact the chair of the Awards and Fellows Committee, Pieter de Wilde, via pieter.dewilde at plymouth.ac.uk<mailto:pieter.dewilde at plymouth.ac.uk> to discuss a possible nomination if required.

Payment will be made either to the academic department before the conference or directly to the student at the conference.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] New to EE4!
Message-ID: <006d01d08cc6$a47049e0$ed50dda0$@ecosynergy.ca>

Hello All,

I was referred to this mailing list by Maria at NRCan :)

I started reading some of the emails online. This is all very interesting
information.

I was wondering one of two things:

1-      Would any of you have a mechanical data input take off sheet? A
simple document to streamline all the mechanical information to be entered
in the model? Rather than us having to review all the different mechanical
drawings and shop drawings trying to find a needle in a hay stack?

2-      Is anyone of you in the Calgary area? I could use some guidance in
regards to how the software "thinks" and data inputs. I have the EE4
modelling guide, and have been using it religiously, but having someone
guiding you through the first model is, in my perspective, way more
efficient!

Thanks for all you help, and I am looking forward to being part of the
community!

About the Event


*Fa?ade Performance 101: Principles and Trends of Facade Performance and
Design*
New high-performance facade technologies enable freedom in architectural
design. Knowledge of facade systems help designers and specifiers meet
stringent energy codes without sacrificing design aesthetics. The
presentation will provide a comprehensive overview of key properties of
facade systems, including common systems, coatings, and applications and
discussion of thermal and visual properties. The presentation will speak to
how facades are evaluated at SOM.

Few things in architecture are more visible, and potentially more impactful
on overall building performance as the building's facade. As design
methodologies, construction methodologies, and analytical tools continue to
rapidly evolve, the potential for greater design synergy between building
systems and the facade is ever growing.

The focus of this workshop will be to provide a baseline understanding of
the principles and mechanics related to curtain wall assemblies and related
facade cladding typologies, as well as define different approaches and
systems related to high performance facade design. In addition, the
workshop will present a variety for a practical understanding for how
different high performance facade concepts can be applied to a variety of
building types in a variety of climate conditions and markets.

Goals of the workshop will include:

   - Provide an understanding of the principles of unitized curtain wall as
   it related to design, performance, and constructibility
   - Understanding of air and water control and its importance in facade
   design
   - Understanding of thermal performance and condensation resistance of
   facade systems
   - Overview of Passive House standards and how it differs from typical
   U.S. construction
   - Basic understanding of a variety of high performance facade typologies
   including ventilated facade systems
   - Basic understanding of how applicability of certain facade typologies
   in certain markets


SPEAKER BIO
Robert Golda joined SOM in early 2014 as a Senior Enclosure Specialist
where he leads the facade technical design efforts on multiple large scale
projects in various regions. Prior to joining SOM, he was an Associate at
Heintges & Associates, a building envelope and curtain wall consulting firm
in New York, where he consulted on numerous large scale civic,
institutional, and commercial projects. Robert has presented at several
building envelope related conferences and has also published research
related to the Integrated Design Process. Along with his colleagues from
David Brody Bond, Robert received a Presidential Citation at the 2012 AIA
National Convention for involvement in the rebuilding of the World Trade
Center Site.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] ASHRAE 90.1G Exhaust Fan modeling problems
Message-ID: <6447d8dea32149bb9447b826d79d67eb@ronexc-mbx04.rec.local>

Dear All,

I got two questions about exhaust fan modeling according to ASHRAE 90.1G-2010, clarifications from experience people would be great;


1-      Proposed system has an exhaust fan, hence I`ll model exhaust fan for 7. VAV with Reheat system as well.

G3.1.2.9.1 says that I should model exhaust fan size as 90% of supply fan. Fair enough, peak flow rate from exhaust will be 90% of VAV peak supply, so there is positive pressure in baseline design zones.



Further, G3.1.2.10.1 says that peak fan power should be split between supply and exhaust in the same proportion as proposed design. For example, my proposed design got 1000 CFM for supply and 1000 CFM for exhaust, so I`ll split "Peak Fan Power Consumption" 50% on baseline design as well.

Finally I`ll model VAV Supply Fan curve as mentioned in G3.1.3.15.



However, here is my real question: What about efficiency curve of the exhaust fan? Appendix G doesn`t say anything about this issue. It only says that (G3.1.2.1) efficiency of HVAC equipment should be modeled as minimum as shown on section 6.4. Section 6.4 doesn`t say anything about Exhaust Fans.



So that means I can arrange efficiency curve of the exhaust fan in baseline however I want? This kinda opens up the possibility of gaming the system, one can see where exhaust fan will usually work and set the efficiency very low at that point of the curve, hence higher kWh consumption for the baseline system.



Could someone experience clarify what should be the efficiency curve of Exhaust Fans according to ASHRAE 90.1G 2010 edition?



2-       As far as I understood, ASHRAE 90.1G says that exhaust fans shouldn`t be modeled for spaces where no supply fan exists. Or better put, if HVAC system serving the zone has no supply fan, then you cannot model exhaust fan.

This seems extremely unfair for large scale projects where garage exhaust fans, toilet exhaust fans are considerably large.

Has any of you tried to model garage and toilet fans in your baseline model and pass through LEED review? What is the best way to follow if your proposed system got garage exhaust and toilet exhaust fans? I really want to model those in baseline as well because it will affect my energy efficiency rating.

Kind regards,

Ismail Volkan Ozdemir
Mechanical Engineer, LEED AP BD+C

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Urban Modeling Training @ MIT
Message-ID: <1B23446CBF250648A2FC775DE3FE7E80D4F25A1A@OC11expo28.exchange.mit.edu>

Dear colleagues,

I am excited to announce that the we will be offering our first full-week Executive Education class on Modeling Urban Sustainability - Energy, Daylight and Walkability<http://architecture.mit.edu/event/modeling-urban-sustainability-energy-daylight-and-walkability> on August 17-21 on the MIT campus in Cambridge, MA.

Cities across the planet are growing at an unprecedented speed. To accommodate the rising number of residents, city governments need to densify and expand while managing their carbon emissions. At the same time, cities have to ensure that the quality of their built environment is not sacrificed at the expense of density. The overall goal is thus to design sustainable, high density neighborhoods that combine building resource-efficiency with quality indoor and outdoor spaces, which in turn support community building and favor human powered modes of transportation. To help city governments and their consultants to develop such neighborhoods, the Sustainable Design Lab<http://mit.edu/sustainabledesignlab/> at MIT has developed a Rhino-based urban modeling platform called umi<http://urbanmodellinginterface.ning.com/>.

In this class the umi development team will present the science and models underlying umi in a manner that is accessible to an audience of urban planners, city governments, utilities, consultants and architects. Participants will acquire a range of urban analysis techniques and be exposed to results from several umi case studies world-wide. Specific simulation outputs that will be discussed are:

*       Operational and embodied building energy use

*       Neighborhood-wide daylight availability

*       Walkability

*       Annual outdoor thermal comfort

We hope to see some of you this summer! Best,

Christoph, Carlos, Cody, Tarek and Timur

A few thoughts:



-          Distributing power between baseline fans in proportion to the
proposed should probably reference proposed fan powers, not flows

-          If you are going to have your exhaust fan operate on VSD and
track the supply, then intuitively the only VSD fan curve provided by 90.1
is as cited under 3.1.3.15, and I would use the same for each system fan.
I should think you could also logically specify a distinct system exhaust
operation/flow schedule citing & matching the proposed design.

-          A general caution on ?gaming? the system:  There are a myriad of
subtle, clever, and diabolical ways one could subvert the intent/purpose of
Appendix G and its ilk? but then what?s the point?   Bruce Lee comes to
mind:  ?Obey the principles without being bound by them.?  It?s never a
good feeling to look back on a bunch of hours you?ve invested developing a
simulation that doesn?t really represent anything.

-          #2: I think you are trying to read new meanings into
G3.1.2.9.1??  Generally for LEED projects, I routinely handle garage
ventilation, local/centralized restroom exhaust, and similar standalone
ventilation systems operating independently of space conditioning systems
as ?process? ventilation (indicating the associated energy consumptions as
such on the EAp2 template).  Essentially those exhaust/ventilation systems
are defined in the proposed model as actually occurring, then the baseline
model is made to match the proposed case.  I?ll often include additional
sub-metering (eQuest) so that I can further demonstrate/document the claim
they?ve been made to match at submission.



Hope that helps!

I am currently exploring different building performance simulation tools that can provide an architecture firm with capability to carry out more detailed forms of performance analysis. In addition to a whole building energy modelling tool, I would like to carry out network airflow modelling and thermal comfort evaluation of passive design proposals.

Can anyone suggest or recommend tool/s currently available which provides this level of functionality? I am currently evaluating Sefaira as a more conceptual tool in addition to IESVE, but would like to know if other alternatives are available.

Hi Chris!



I generally draw a line where a fan is involved with space conditioning.
If we?re talking about restroom fans operating independently from the air
handlers, I?d be comfy calling that ?process,? but if we?re talking about a
kitchen?s MAU or heat recovery exhaust fans, that wouldn?t get copied over
to the baseline.



Pfan definitely is supposed to incorporate all fans associated with the
baseline system.  No questions there.  This line is probably informed in
part where GBCI has made it clear garage ventilation is an example of a
process load.  The ?space conditioning? litmus is how I reconcile that
example with the Pfan rules.



To date, I?ve not had issue with this approach in term of LEED review, and
I?m quite clear in documenting these distinctions.  As always however,
YMMV!



[Chris separately okayed me sending this reply to the list, by the way.]

Hello Nick,



I am wondering about your approach to treat exhaust fans as ?process?. I
thought the System Fan power was to be calculated including all supply,
return, exhaust and relief fans on the system.  I have been interpreting
that (G3.1.2.9.2) to mean that washroom, storage room, and other exhaust
fans receiving make-up air from the System are included in the fan power
calculation for that System.  If the Proposed design fan power is greater
than the allowance, then I reduce all the fans (including the exhaust fans)
in the Baseline model proportionally.

*Subject:* Re: [Bldg-sim] ASHRAE 90.1G Exhaust Fan modeling problems



A few thoughts:



-          Distributing power between baseline fans in proportion to the
proposed should probably reference proposed fan powers, not flows

-          If you are going to have your exhaust fan operate on VSD and
track the supply, then intuitively the only VSD fan curve provided by 90.1
is as cited under 3.1.3.15, and I would use the same for each system fan.
I should think you could also logically specify a distinct system exhaust
operation/flow schedule citing & matching the proposed design.

-          A general caution on ?gaming? the system:  There are a myriad of
subtle, clever, and diabolical ways one could subvert the intent/purpose of
Appendix G and its ilk? but then what?s the point?   Bruce Lee comes to
mind:  ?Obey the principles without being bound by them.?  It?s never a
good feeling to look back on a bunch of hours you?ve invested developing a
simulation that doesn?t really represent anything.

-          #2: I think you are trying to read new meanings into
G3.1.2.9.1??  Generally for LEED projects, I routinely handle garage
ventilation, local/centralized restroom exhaust, and similar standalone
ventilation systems operating independently of space conditioning systems
as ?process? ventilation (indicating the associated energy consumptions as
such on the EAp2 template).  Essentially those exhaust/ventilation systems
are defined in the proposed model as actually occurring, then the baseline
model is made to match the proposed case.  I?ll often include additional
sub-metering (eQuest) so that I can further demonstrate/document the claim
they?ve been made to match at submission.



Hope that helps!

Hi Volkan,



I can answer your second question. Exhaust fans in unconditioned zones
should be modeled identical in base and proposed case.

Dear All,



I got two questions about exhaust fan modeling according to ASHRAE
90.1G-2010, clarifications from experience people would be great;



1-      Proposed system has an exhaust fan, hence I`ll model exhaust fan
for 7. VAV with Reheat system as well.

G3.1.2.9.1 says that I should model exhaust fan size as 90% of supply fan.
Fair enough, peak flow rate from exhaust will be 90% of VAV peak supply, so
there is positive pressure in baseline design zones.



Further, G3.1.2.10.1 says that peak fan power should be split between
supply and exhaust in the same proportion as proposed design. For example,
my proposed design got 1000 CFM for supply and 1000 CFM for exhaust, so
I`ll split ?Peak Fan Power Consumption? 50% on baseline design as well.

Finally I`ll model VAV *Supply* Fan curve as mentioned in G3.1.3.15.



However, here is my real question: What about efficiency curve of the
exhaust fan? Appendix G doesn`t say anything about this issue. It only says
that (G3.1.2.1) efficiency of HVAC equipment should be modeled as minimum
as shown on section 6.4. Section 6.4 doesn`t say anything about Exhaust
Fans.



So that means I can arrange efficiency curve of the exhaust fan in baseline
however I want? This kinda opens up the possibility of gaming the system,
one can see where exhaust fan will usually work and set the efficiency very
low at that point of the curve, hence higher kWh consumption for the
baseline system.



Could someone experience clarify what should be the efficiency curve of
Exhaust Fans according to ASHRAE 90.1G 2010 edition?



2-       As far as I understood, ASHRAE 90.1G says that exhaust fans
shouldn`t be modeled for spaces where no supply fan exists. Or better put,
if HVAC system serving the zone has no supply fan, then you cannot model
exhaust fan.

This seems extremely unfair for large scale projects where garage exhaust
fans, toilet exhaust fans are considerably large.

Has any of you tried to model garage and toilet fans in your baseline model
and pass through LEED review? What is the best way to follow if your
proposed system got garage exhaust and toilet exhaust fans? I really want
to model those in baseline as well because it will affect my energy
efficiency rating.



Kind regards,

Dear James,

You could try IDA ICE. It has a strong airflow network model and both the PMV/PPD and adaptive models of thermal comfort are implemented. Compared to other tools (that I know of) it is strong on systems, extremely versatile and easy to use. The downside is slow simulations - especially for large models with many zones.

The guys at EQUA have told me that the slow simulations are a consequence of the airflow model (which you cannot turn off). According to them, IDA ICE is actually fast compared to other programmes (e.g. Energy+) with the air flow model running.

Hi James,

I would like to share my experience related to IDA ICE during my MSc thesis . The program indeed takes a long time to simulate but in my opinion the results are worth the wait . Anticipate starting the simulation at the 5 in the evening and coming back in the morning to see it still running for large buildings.

That said the results we got from the software were a good match against the survey's we did through a thermal comfort form for a multistory apartment building , which also had decent enough cross reference to a thermal comfort meter based empirical measurements taken over time .

I found the software more tailored towards research than the commercial market ( time involved , support for errors, crashes etc., it might have evolved over time this was back in 2012) but then how often do we simulate PMV indices when working with real world deadlines ....

I would be interested to know from the group how fast can Sefaira deliver results ??

Hi James,

 

EnergyPlus seems an obvious option. It does both.

Hi James,

 

I would like to share my experience related to IDA ICE during my MSc thesis
. The program indeed takes a long time to simulate but in my opinion the
results are worth the wait . Anticipate starting the simulation at the 5 in
the evening and coming back in the morning to see it still running for large
buildings.

 

That said the results we got from the software were a good match against the
survey?s we did through a thermal comfort form for a multistory apartment
building , which also had decent enough cross reference to a thermal comfort
meter based empirical measurements taken over time .

 

I found the software more tailored towards research than the commercial
market ( time involved , support for errors, crashes etc., it might have
evolved over time this was back in 2012) but then how often do we simulate
PMV indices when working with real world deadlines 
.

 

I would be interested to know from the group how fast can Sefaira deliver
results ??

Dear James,

 

You could try IDA ICE. It has a strong airflow network model and both the
PMV/PPD and adaptive models of thermal comfort are implemented. Compared to
other tools (that I know of) it is strong on systems, extremely versatile
and easy to use. The downside is slow simulations ? especially for large
models with many zones. 

 

The guys at EQUA have told me that the slow simulations are a consequence of
the airflow model (which you cannot turn off). According to them, IDA ICE is
actually fast compared to other programmes (e.g. Energy+) with the air flow
model running.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Simulation Tool Recommendations

 

I am currently exploring different building performance simulation tools
that can provide an architecture firm with capability to carry out more
detailed forms of performance analysis. In addition to a whole building
energy modelling tool, I would like to carry out network airflow modelling
and thermal comfort evaluation of passive design proposals. 

 

Can anyone suggest or recommend tool/s currently available which provides
this level of functionality? I am currently evaluating Sefaira as a more
conceptual tool in addition to IESVE, but would like to know if other
alternatives are available.

 

Many thanks,

 

James Woodall

Bldg-Sim Community -

I'm trying to compile a list of why it might be inappropriate to compare Appendix G models to actual consumption data.  This comes about because I recently got into a debate with one of my co-workers when looking at the infamous NBI chart/study that shows little correlation to predicted and actual energy values of LEED buildings.  I was trying to explain that the Appendix G model's intent is NOT to be compared to actual consumption, as it is a modeling protocol aimed at creating consistent relative comparisons for LEED points.

Here are the reasons thus far that support this notion (that App G models shouldn't be compared to actual data).  Does anyone know of any resources out there that expand upon this?  Or can you think other reasons?


-          Appendix G does not take into account external shading, which can be critical in urban environments for accurate energy predictions

-          Schedules are typically not created with the intent of being predictive.  Overall building hours are adhered to, but detailed schedule creation is not usually in the scope of a LEED model (or is it, in your experience?).  For instance, typical plug load base values during unoccupied times are .3, this is a pretty big assumption.

-          The App G model uses a TMY weather file, which can vary from the current weather year (I wonder on average by how much?)

-          Infiltration values are assumed, unless blower door testing has been done (which is rare for commercial buildings).

-          Thermostat values are modeled as consistent across the building, which is rarely the case in an actual operating building

Any additional insight is much appreciated!

Jacob,

Happy to hear that other people are thinking the same.

I was into this subject on my own thoughts recently.

I would like to add in your list: Occupants' behavior actually which is not
in the stage to be included into the prediction.
I would add commissioning as well along with controls simulation and
controls operation.

Apologies because I haven't worked with LEED projects but I think the above
applied in general to "the performance gap".

Really looking forward to hearing more about this subject as I am not that
experienced engineer yet, but really interested in "the performance" side
of buildings.

Best,
Maria-Lida Kounadi

Climate files used in the simulations versus the actual weather.

I?m in the midst of a project that shows a variance in EUI of up to 200% just by changing the climate file for the DOE primary school.  Full results to be presented in September.

Add in all the other factors already mentioned, and if your 90.1 model comes anywhere close the real buildings? it?s far more likely that the 90.1 model was extremely ?lucky? than it is that the model used accurate assumptions.

Nathan

Dear Colleagues,
   A reminder that Thermal Energy System Specialists, LLC will be 
hosting a three day TRNSYS Training Course in Madison, WI on June 2-4, 
2015 . TRNSYS is a highly flexible modeling tool that has been under 
continual development since the 1970s and which is ideally suited to 
research and to simulating complex and innovative energy systems.

   The course will cover both introductory and advanced topics including 
HVAC system simulation, whole building simulation, and stand alone 
system development. The process of writing and adding new components to 
the TRNSYS library will be demonstrated. Given TRNSYS's flexibility we 
can usually cover topics of specific interest to course attendees.

Please visit the website for an outline, registration form and more 
information:

Impact of weather depends on how climate-responsive the building is.  Recently finished a paper that showed +-5% variation in year-to-year weather in some building types (constant volume systems mostly) and more than 20% in others.  Location and humidity also play a role.  One building type that is extremely energy-intensive (restaurant) also had high variation due to weather - outside preheating/cooling.

Images from extremely hot and extremely cold climates - identical model, actual weather from 1980-2014.  1980 on right. TMY-type files on left.

I agree fully with all of the above comments and would like to add these:

   - Even buildings that are commissioned properly will see their
   performance erode over time.  There are hundreds of reason for this,
   ranging from poor maintenance to well-intentioned maintenance people not
   having time to monitor operations well.  There is NO BUILDING that operates
   well for long.
   - Buildings often see changes in operation, occupancy and schedule.
   These are oftimes gradual changes over a period of years, but can be
   substantial

I believe Appendix G is not meant to measure the performance of the existing building. ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G Technical Committee is the right source to answer this question. They can clarify the intention of the APP G modeling methodology.

I agree fully with all of the above comments and would like to add these:

  *   Even buildings that are commissioned properly will see their performance erode over time.  There are hundreds of reason for this, ranging from poor maintenance to well-intentioned maintenance people not having time to monitor operations well.  There is NO BUILDING that operates well for long.
  *   Buildings often see changes in operation, occupancy and schedule.  These are oftimes gradual changes over a period of years, but can be substantial

I?m in the midst of a project that shows a variance in EUI of up to 200% just by changing the climate file for the DOE primary school.  Full results to be presented in September.

Add in all the other factors already mentioned, and if your 90.1 model comes anywhere close the real buildings? it?s far more likely that the 90.1 model was extremely ?lucky? than it is that the model used accurate assumptions.

Jacob,

Happy to hear that other people are thinking the same.

I was into this subject on my own thoughts recently.

I would like to add in your list: Occupants' behavior actually which is not in the stage to be included into the prediction.
I would add commissioning as well along with controls simulation and controls operation.

Apologies because I haven't worked with LEED projects but I think the above applied in general to "the performance gap".

Really looking forward to hearing more about this subject as I am not that experienced engineer yet, but really interested in "the performance" side of buildings.

Best,
Maria-Lida Kounadi

Bldg-Sim Community ?

I?m trying to compile a list of why it might be inappropriate to compare Appendix G models to actual consumption data.  This comes about because I recently got into a debate with one of my co-workers when looking at the infamous NBI chart/study that shows little correlation to predicted and actual energy values of LEED buildings.  I was trying to explain that the Appendix G model?s intent is NOT to be compared to actual consumption, as it is a modeling protocol aimed at creating consistent relative comparisons for LEED points.

Here are the reasons thus far that support this notion (that App G models shouldn?t be compared to actual data).  Does anyone know of any resources out there that expand upon this?  Or can you think other reasons?


-          Appendix G does not take into account external shading, which can be critical in urban environments for accurate energy predictions

-          Schedules are typically not created with the intent of being predictive.  Overall building hours are adhered to, but detailed schedule creation is not usually in the scope of a LEED model (or is it, in your experience?).  For instance, typical plug load base values during unoccupied times are .3, this is a pretty big assumption.

-          The App G model uses a TMY weather file, which can vary from the current weather year (I wonder on average by how much?)

-          Infiltration values are assumed, unless blower door testing has been done (which is rare for commercial buildings).

-          Thermostat values are modeled as consistent across the building, which is rarely the case in an actual operating building

Any additional insight is much appreciated!

The text of Appendix G states this explicitly in Section G1.2, Note 2:

"Neither the *proposed building performance* nor the *baseline building
performance* are predictions of actual energy consumption or costs for
the *proposed
design* after construction. Actual experience will differ from these
calculations due to variations such as occupancy, building operation and
maintenance, weather, energy use not covered by this procedure, changes in
energy rates between design of the building and occupancy, and the
precision of the calculation tool."

Dear Jacob,

This is an eternal debate and there are many reasons for moving away from the use of 90.1 Appendix G to evaluate the performance of a building designs.  To answer your question directly, we worked a few years ago with Enermodal in Canada on a comparison between design phase building energy models (BEM) prepared for LEED Canada certification (slightly different to Appendix G) to calibrated BEM and measured energy use for 18 buildings. The main findings are quoted below:

Analysis of a Simplified Calibration Procedure for 18 Design-Phase Building Energy Models
H W Samuelson, A Ghorayshi and C F Reinhart
Journal of Building Performance Simulation, DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19401493.2014.988752
This paper evaluates the accuracy of 18 design-phase building energy models, built according to LEED Canada protocol, and investigates the effectiveness of model calibration steps to improve simulation predictions with respect to measured energy data. These calibration steps, applied in professional practice, included inputting actual weather data, adding unregulated loads, revising plug loads (often with submetered data), and other simple updates. In sum, the design-phase energy models underpredicted the total measured energy consumption by 36%. Following the calibration steps, this error was reduced to a net 7% underprediction. For the monthly energy use intensity (EUI), the coefficient of variation of the root mean square error improved from 45% to 24%. Revising plug loads made the largest impact in these cases. This step increased the EUI by 15% median (32% mean) in the models. This impact far exceeded that of calibrating the weather data, even in a sensitivity test using extreme weather years.

  *   Buildings often see changes in operation, occupancy and schedule.  These are oftimes gradual changes over a period of years, but can be substantial

Jacob,

Happy to hear that other people are thinking the same.

I was into this subject on my own thoughts recently.

I would like to add in your list: Occupants' behavior actually which is not in the stage to be included into the prediction.
I would add commissioning as well along with controls simulation and controls operation.

Apologies because I haven't worked with LEED projects but I think the above applied in general to "the performance gap".

Really looking forward to hearing more about this subject as I am not that experienced engineer yet, but really interested in "the performance" side of buildings.

Bldg-Sim Community ?

I?m trying to compile a list of why it might be inappropriate to compare Appendix G models to actual consumption data.  This comes about because I recently got into a debate with one of my co-workers when looking at the infamous NBI chart/study that shows little correlation to predicted and actual energy values of LEED buildings.  I was trying to explain that the Appendix G model?s intent is NOT to be compared to actual consumption, as it is a modeling protocol aimed at creating consistent relative comparisons for LEED points.

Here are the reasons thus far that support this notion (that App G models shouldn?t be compared to actual data).  Does anyone know of any resources out there that expand upon this?  Or can you think other reasons?


-          Appendix G does not take into account external shading, which can be critical in urban environments for accurate energy predictions

-          Schedules are typically not created with the intent of being predictive.  Overall building hours are adhered to, but detailed schedule creation is not usually in the scope of a LEED model (or is it, in your experience?).  For instance, typical plug load base values during unoccupied times are .3, this is a pretty big assumption.

-          The App G model uses a TMY weather file, which can vary from the current weather year (I wonder on average by how much?)

-          Infiltration values are assumed, unless blower door testing has been done (which is rare for commercial buildings).

-          Thermostat values are modeled as consistent across the building, which is rarely the case in an actual operating building

Any additional insight is much appreciated!

A couple of points to add to the list:

1.      Thermal bridging ? I only know of one firm who attempt to include the effects of all thermal bridging in the building envelope: slab edges/balconies, window connections, curtain wall transitions, shelf angles, etc.

2.      Equipment performance curves.  It is difficult and time consuming to chase down the manufacturer data for creating performance curves.

There is a section in Appendix G (G1.2) addressing this:

 

Neither the proposed building performance nor the

baseline building performance are predictions of

actual energy consumption or costs for the proposed

design after construction. Actual experience will differ

from these calculations due to variations such as occupancy,

building operation and maintenance, weather,

energy use not covered by this procedure, changes in

energy rates between design of the building and occupancy,

and the precision of the calculation tool.

 

You may also want to check out articles on building labeling systems that discuss differences between asset (theoretical, modeling-based) and operational (based on actual utility bills) ratings, such as the one attached (see p.4-6). Both have value as long as they are interpreted correctly.

Jacob et al:

Some more points to the mix:

1) Increased infiltration/exfiltration due to seasonal changes in wind patterns, which mostly affect high-rises, is not modeled very often. The changing nature of wind (more or less cold or hot wind coming from a given direction) will affect cooling and heating loads.

2) Not every software can model the thermal mass of concrete or brick.

3) Microclimatic conditions (the urban overshadowing Jacob was mentioning) have to do also with air movement (urban canyon effect), and are not modeled often.

4) Buildings with Occupancy/Vacancy sensors are usually not modeled with accuracy. App G just gives a 10% LPD reduction when using them (in theory you could model them if you know the exact patterns of occupancy before construction, which never happens).

5) Daylight Harvesting and Electrochromic glass are too dynamic systems to be modeled accurately (unpredictable occupancy again).

However, I do agree with Prof. Reinhart about calibrating design models with as much real time data as possible. That way we could recreate other scenarios (climate change, systems decay, the impact of a change of occupancy, etc.).

There is a section in Appendix G (G1.2) addressing this:

Neither the proposed building performance nor the
baseline building performance are predictions of
actual energy consumption or costs for the proposed
design after construction. Actual experience will differ
from these calculations due to variations such as occupancy,
building operation and maintenance, weather,
energy use not covered by this procedure, changes in
energy rates between design of the building and occupancy,
and the precision of the calculation tool.

You may also want to check out articles on building labeling systems that discuss differences between asset (theoretical, modeling-based) and operational (based on actual utility bills) ratings, such as the one attached (see p.4-6). Both have value as long as they are interpreted correctly.

Jacob,

Happy to hear that other people are thinking the same.

I was into this subject on my own thoughts recently.

I would like to add in your list: Occupants' behavior actually which is not in the stage to be included into the prediction.
I would add commissioning as well along with controls simulation and controls operation.

Apologies because I haven't worked with LEED projects but I think the above applied in general to "the performance gap".

Really looking forward to hearing more about this subject as I am not that experienced engineer yet, but really interested in "the performance" side of buildings.

Bldg-Sim Community ?

I?m trying to compile a list of why it might be inappropriate to compare Appendix G models to actual consumption data.  This comes about because I recently got into a debate with one of my co-workers when looking at the infamous NBI chart/study that shows little correlation to predicted and actual energy values of LEED buildings.  I was trying to explain that the Appendix G model?s intent is NOT to be compared to actual consumption, as it is a modeling protocol aimed at creating consistent relative comparisons for LEED points.

Here are the reasons thus far that support this notion (that App G models shouldn?t be compared to actual data).  Does anyone know of any resources out there that expand upon this?  Or can you think other reasons?


-          Appendix G does not take into account external shading, which can be critical in urban environments for accurate energy predictions

-          Schedules are typically not created with the intent of being predictive.  Overall building hours are adhered to, but detailed schedule creation is not usually in the scope of a LEED model (or is it, in your experience?).  For instance, typical plug load base values during unoccupied times are .3, this is a pretty big assumption.

-          The App G model uses a TMY weather file, which can vary from the current weather year (I wonder on average by how much?)

-          Infiltration values are assumed, unless blower door testing has been done (which is rare for commercial buildings).

-          Thermostat values are modeled as consistent across the building, which is rarely the case in an actual operating building

Any additional insight is much appreciated!

Lots of strong points raised so far ? I think this ?conversation/debate? is
one we must have all faced at some point.



I don?t have much else to add to what?s already been suggested, except to
note many of the critical assumptions of occupant behavior / plug load
density / system operations have an additional layer of obfuscation that
shouldn?t be missed for new construction calibration:  NC buildings? actual
energy bills immediately after occupancy are usually NOT representative of
?typical? usage (for which Appendix G models are necessarily/justifiably
based upon).  The occupants are settling into, learning to operate, and
calibrating/messing with/breaking the building?s systems.  System
commissioning is working the bugs out of actual system operations to match
(or improve upon) the original design.  I?ve also run into it taking some
years to wrestle with the local utility when the wrong rates are applied to
the building.  Whenever I am tasked with calibrating from a newly occupied
building (LEED/App.G or otherwise), it?s a high priority to determine at
what extent the available utility metering/bills may be skewed by such
?growing pains.?



With all this said however, all these ?shortcomings? for mis-applying 90.1
Appendix G models to the task of ?predicting? actual energy costs help to
frame what they are actually very GOOD for.  I think it might behoove you
to at least outline that purpose in contrast:

-          [*insert G1.2 here*]

-          Correctly developed 90.1 App. G models make very decent
?platforms? from which to develop a calibrated model down the road.

o   They have the advantage of a structured set of assumptions which can be
transformed into a checklist for surveying actual operations.

o   For developing a calibrated model ?from scratch,? much of the first
stages of development are ready-made with a Proposed Appendix G model.
Geometries, construction/window types, LPD?s, and mechanical systems are
first defined referencing available construction documentation.  From
there, a brief review of ?as-built? documentation (including submittals)
should highlight some initial variances for evaluation.

-          For the intended/stated purpose: developing a performance rating
well before actual operations can be known, 90.1/Appendix G (in combination
with the additional requirements of LEED and rigor of GBCI simulation
review) is a fine option.  Analogous standards I?ve worked with do some
things better and some things worse, and there will likely always be room
for improvement, but for all that we talk of problems/holes  in the
standard as applied to the ?real world? of modern building design, the
standard covers quite a bit well enough.

-          ?Design phase? modeling, inclusive of the Appendix G protocol,
is perhaps most critically useful in determining *relative* (not absolute)
performance for design alternatives to inform the design process.  In my
experience, it?s a slippery slope to quantify design alternatives in terms
other than relative % performance increases.   Presenting such results in
terms of $$$ savings supports the fallacy that such early results are
founded upon something other than a broad range of (probably incorrect)
assumptions.  This is not a comfortable concept for most to grasp, but
energy simulations are sometimes at their most informative when they are
?wrong.?  I have found it a difficult issue to explain for those outside
our field, so I usually try to guide conversations around such sticky
matters.  The broader point I am trying to make in this bullet is that
?relative? performance metrics have a distinct value from absolute cost
predictions, and relative metrics translate better into informing the
design process.  Maybe someone else can make the point more eloquently? ?



I hope that adds to the discussion for some =)!

Appendix G model?s intent is NOT to be compared to actual consumption, as
it is a modeling protocol aimed at creating consistent relative comparisons
for LEED points.



Here are the reasons thus far that support this notion (that App G models
shouldn?t be compared to actual data).  Does anyone know of any resources
out there that expand upon this?  Or can you think other reasons?



-          Appendix G does not take into account external shading, which
can be critical in urban environments for accurate energy predictions

-          Schedules are typically not created with the intent of being
predictive.  Overall building hours are adhered to, but detailed schedule
creation is not usually in the scope of a LEED model (or is it, in your
experience?).  For instance, typical plug load base values during
unoccupied times are .3, this is a pretty big assumption.

-          The App G model uses a TMY weather file, which can vary from the
current weather year (I wonder on average by how much?)

-          Infiltration values are assumed, unless blower door testing has
been done (which is rare for commercial buildings).

-          Thermostat values are modeled as consistent across the building,
which is rarely the case in an actual operating building



Any additional insight is much appreciated!

It occurs to me that every energy modeler "worth his / her salt" recognizes
the limitations of a "baseline" model.  It's a reference point intended to
compare with another reference.  It's a relative, not an absolute,
comparison.

The models which compare predicted versus actual (e.g., utility bill)
performance are a different matter.  At that point, you start trying to
gain understanding about why the model differs from reality.  Until you
have actual data, however, it's all relative and may bear little
resemblance to reality.

I?d like to add that although 90.1 Appendix G includes scope language as pointed out by several board members, that its purpose is ?to make an apples-to-apples comparison for rating? it doesn?t mean that the model couldn?t also reflect the expected energy use of the building subject to some of the major assumptions.

That Appendix G scope statement shouldn?t be a ?get out of jail free? card. I don?t think people on this list mean it that way, but I can imagine some confusion if an owner uses Google to search for ?accuracy of building energy models using 90.1 Appendix G? and this thread comes up.

The NBI chart in my opinion is provocative and out of date with current industry practices and standards ? some of the buildings use double the energy of the baseline building! How could this happen? There must have been some significant variances between the modeled equipment and what was actually constructed, and the building may be operating much differently than the original assumptions ? 200% energy use doesn?t happen from faulty zoning, slightly incorrect setpoints, default equipment curves, 0.5 W/sf plug load equipment when it was actually 0.75 W/sf, etc. There must be major equipment variances, process loads, and/or extended operating hours.

I look forward to an updated study in this regard based on current modeling practices, USGBC?s review process which has evolved since that study was published, availability of Appendix G as a resource as opposed to using ECB which is designed for pass/fail analysis, and USGBC collecting data from buildings going forward?hopefully this study is in the works.

I?ll suggest that our message to those retaining consultants for modeling services should be:


?         The 90.1 comparison for LEED or Green Globes has some constraints in order to make it a model to model comparison across many buildings that are submitted. Appendix G doesn?t have a primary intention of predicting actual energy use. Energy efficiency investments made to the building based on modeled energy savings are likely to remain valid (or perform even better in terms of payback) if actual energy use comes in higher than the 90.1 model?if the systems are verified to be operating properly, and the extra energy use may be coming from higher plug loads and operating hours.



?         Yes the models can provide a predictive estimate of energy use, but the level of coordination between the owner, design team, contractor, and modeler requires extra effort from all parties. An experienced modeler will have a higher probability of asking the right questions from these parties to close the gap between modeled and actual energy use. The energy model is not able to account for changes that take place after the fact unless information is exchanged and the modeler?s scope includes updating the model at that point. This should be emphasized for any core and shell buildings, and any building that will have high EUI tenants that aren?t known at the time of the energy model?s creation.



?         In order to verify the cumulative performance of ECMs or investigate higher than expected energy use, an M&V process is recommended after the building is occupied in order to refine the model to correct for building occupancy factors, especially plug loads and operating hours, as well as actual weather. Comparing a pre-occupancy energy model to post-occupancy energy use data includes bias errors that need to be addressed through a calibrated energy model. The calibrated model may (will) provide different results than what was submitted to LEED or Green Globes.

This discussion also hinges on what someone considers to be ?close? ? is that within 5%, 10%, or 25%? An expectation needs to be set before the project.

If anyone wants to propose some ASHRAE research to provide better plug load and operating schedule data, let me know! TC 7.6 research subcommittee (among others) wants your input?

Jacob et al:

Some more points to the mix:

1) Increased infiltration/exfiltration due to seasonal changes in wind patterns, which mostly affect high-rises, is not modeled very often. The changing nature of wind (more or less cold or hot wind coming from a given direction) will affect cooling and heating loads.

2) Not every software can model the thermal mass of concrete or brick.

3) Microclimatic conditions (the urban overshadowing Jacob was mentioning) have to do also with air movement (urban canyon effect), and are not modeled often.

4) Buildings with Occupancy/Vacancy sensors are usually not modeled with accuracy. App G just gives a 10% LPD reduction when using them (in theory you could model them if you know the exact patterns of occupancy before construction, which never happens).

5) Daylight Harvesting and Electrochromic glass are too dynamic systems to be modeled accurately (unpredictable occupancy again).

However, I do agree with Prof. Reinhart about calibrating design models with as much real time data as possible. That way we could recreate other scenarios (climate change, systems decay, the impact of a change of occupancy, etc.).

There is a section in Appendix G (G1.2) addressing this:

Neither the proposed building performance nor the
baseline building performance are predictions of
actual energy consumption or costs for the proposed
design after construction. Actual experience will differ
from these calculations due to variations such as occupancy,
building operation and maintenance, weather,
energy use not covered by this procedure, changes in
energy rates between design of the building and occupancy,
and the precision of the calculation tool.

You may also want to check out articles on building labeling systems that discuss differences between asset (theoretical, modeling-based) and operational (based on actual utility bills) ratings, such as the one attached (see p.4-6). Both have value as long as they are interpreted correctly.

I believe Appendix G is not meant to measure the performance of the existing building. ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G Technical Committee is the right source to answer this question. They can clarify the intention of the APP G modeling methodology.

I agree fully with all of the above comments and would like to add these:

  *   Even buildings that are commissioned properly will see their performance erode over time.  There are hundreds of reason for this, ranging from poor maintenance to well-intentioned maintenance people not having time to monitor operations well.  There is NO BUILDING that operates well for long.
  *   Buildings often see changes in operation, occupancy and schedule.  These are oftimes gradual changes over a period of years, but can be substantial

I?m in the midst of a project that shows a variance in EUI of up to 200% just by changing the climate file for the DOE primary school.  Full results to be presented in September.

Add in all the other factors already mentioned, and if your 90.1 model comes anywhere close the real buildings? it?s far more likely that the 90.1 model was extremely ?lucky? than it is that the model used accurate assumptions.

Jacob,

Happy to hear that other people are thinking the same.

I was into this subject on my own thoughts recently.

I would like to add in your list: Occupants' behavior actually which is not in the stage to be included into the prediction.
I would add commissioning as well along with controls simulation and controls operation.

Apologies because I haven't worked with LEED projects but I think the above applied in general to "the performance gap".

Really looking forward to hearing more about this subject as I am not that experienced engineer yet, but really interested in "the performance" side of buildings.

Best,
Maria-Lida Kounadi

Bldg-Sim Community ?

I?m trying to compile a list of why it might be inappropriate to compare Appendix G models to actual consumption data.  This comes about because I recently got into a debate with one of my co-workers when looking at the infamous NBI chart/study that shows little correlation to predicted and actual energy values of LEED buildings.  I was trying to explain that the Appendix G model?s intent is NOT to be compared to actual consumption, as it is a modeling protocol aimed at creating consistent relative comparisons for LEED points.

Here are the reasons thus far that support this notion (that App G models shouldn?t be compared to actual data).  Does anyone know of any resources out there that expand upon this?  Or can you think other reasons?


-          Appendix G does not take into account external shading, which can be critical in urban environments for accurate energy predictions

-          Schedules are typically not created with the intent of being predictive.  Overall building hours are adhered to, but detailed schedule creation is not usually in the scope of a LEED model (or is it, in your experience?).  For instance, typical plug load base values during unoccupied times are .3, this is a pretty big assumption.

-          The App G model uses a TMY weather file, which can vary from the current weather year (I wonder on average by how much?)

-          Infiltration values are assumed, unless blower door testing has been done (which is rare for commercial buildings).

-          Thermostat values are modeled as consistent across the building, which is rarely the case in an actual operating building

Any additional insight is much appreciated!

All,

I would agree with all of the factors mentioned that absolutely can result
in deviations between actual and modeled building performance. I would also
echo the sentiment that following modeling rules shouldn't necessarily
preclude us from attempting to better predict actual building performance
through the LEED process. Applying careful attention to important details
and a healthy dose of experience (bringing together real life building
performance knowledge as it relates to the grey areas - namely schedules,
equipment controls, occupant behavior, etc) can truly help close the gap.
At the end of the day, a rating system should be attempting to reward
buildings that actually perform well, not theoretically perform well (and
as modeler's we should take a leading role in making *good* (i.e.
fair) assumptions).

My colleague (Janine Vanry) has recently completed research (to be
published soon) for her masters thesis at the University of Waterloo
(Ontario, Canada) which studied how LEED certified academic buildings in
southwestern Ontario performed in comparison to government energy intensity
benchmarks, campus-wide energy intensities, and in general how LEED
(modeled) results compare to actual building performance (as measured
through M&V). Consistent with Dr Samuelson's (et al.) research findings, the
discrepancies between the modeled results and the actual energy intensities
showed that there was an under-prediction anywhere from 2% to 44%.

While energy modeling professionals understand (as is evident by this
thread) that there will be differences between the documented EAc1 energy
savings and actual building energy usage, this isn't always communicated
and understood by the building owners and the professionals we work with.

Thank you all for your thoughtful insight on this matter!  It?s an important debate ? both in understanding the capabilities/limitations of our craft as energy modelers, but also to communicate our value to the community at large.

To clarify slightly, my question revolved around how the specific modeling protocol of Appendix G could account for the ?performance? gap between modeled and actual use.  Thus, the fact that buildings aren?t operated as the energy model specified and the lack of building commissioning, while true and important, are not inherent to the intent of Appendix G modeling.  The most interesting question is, ?If you model a LEED App G model perfectly according to protocol, AND the building was operated according to the modeled schedules, will it predict the right number??  Lots of your responses lent insight into this question, thanks again!

I?ve revised my list below based on your responses:

Added:
-   Plug load values are assumed, which can have a huge impact on overall energy (Thanks Christoph and Chris Hadlock for the insight)
-  Insulation values are largely specified without thought to thermal bridging
-  HVAC controls simulation is often simplified
- Performance curves are often not simulated due to increased effort and unavailability of performance data from manufacturers

Original:

-          Appendix G does not take into account external shading, which can be critical in urban environments for accurate energy predictions

-          Schedules are typically not created with the intent of being predictive.  Overall building hours are adhered to, but detailed schedule creation is not usually in the scope of a LEED model (or is it, in your experience?).  For instance, typical plug load base values during unoccupied times are .3, this is a pretty big assumption.

-          The App G model uses a TMY weather file, which can vary from the current weather year (I wonder on average by how much?)

-          Infiltration values are assumed, unless blower door testing has been done (which is rare for commercial buildings).

-          Thermostat values are modeled as consistent across the building, which is rarely the case in an actual operating building

All,

I would agree with all of the factors mentioned that absolutely can result in deviations between actual and modeled building performance. I would also echo the sentiment that following modeling rules shouldn't necessarily preclude us from attempting to better predict actual building performance through the LEED process. Applying careful attention to important details and a healthy dose of experience (bringing together real life building performance knowledge as it relates to the grey areas - namely schedules, equipment controls, occupant behavior, etc) can truly help close the gap. At the end of the day, a rating system should be attempting to reward buildings that actually perform well, not theoretically perform well (and as modeler's we should take a leading role in making good (i.e. fair) assumptions).

My colleague (Janine Vanry) has recently completed research (to be published soon) for her masters thesis at the University of Waterloo (Ontario, Canada) which studied how LEED certified academic buildings in southwestern Ontario performed in comparison to government energy intensity benchmarks, campus-wide energy intensities, and in general how LEED (modeled) results compare to actual building performance (as measured through M&V). Consistent with Dr Samuelson's (et al.) research findings, the discrepancies between the modeled results and the actual energy intensities showed that there was an under-prediction anywhere from 2% to 44%.

While energy modeling professionals understand (as is evident by this thread) that there will be differences between the documented EAc1 energy savings and actual building energy usage, this isn't always communicated and understood by the building owners and the professionals we work with.

Dear Jacob,

This is an eternal debate and there are many reasons for moving away from the use of 90.1 Appendix G to evaluate the performance of a building designs.  To answer your question directly, we worked a few years ago with Enermodal in Canada on a comparison between design phase building energy models (BEM) prepared for LEED Canada certification (slightly different to Appendix G) to calibrated BEM and measured energy use for 18 buildings. The main findings are quoted below:

Analysis of a Simplified Calibration Procedure for 18 Design-Phase Building Energy Models
H W Samuelson, A Ghorayshi and C F Reinhart
Journal of Building Performance Simulation, DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19401493.2014.988752
This paper evaluates the accuracy of 18 design-phase building energy models, built according to LEED Canada protocol, and investigates the effectiveness of model calibration steps to improve simulation predictions with respect to measured energy data. These calibration steps, applied in professional practice, included inputting actual weather data, adding unregulated loads, revising plug loads (often with submetered data), and other simple updates. In sum, the design-phase energy models underpredicted the total measured energy consumption by 36%. Following the calibration steps, this error was reduced to a net 7% underprediction. For the monthly energy use intensity (EUI), the coefficient of variation of the root mean square error improved from 45% to 24%. Revising plug loads made the largest impact in these cases. This step increased the EUI by 15% median (32% mean) in the models. This impact far exceeded that of calibrating the weather data, even in a sensitivity test using extreme weather years.

I believe Appendix G is not meant to measure the performance of the existing building. ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G Technical Committee is the right source to answer this question. They can clarify the intention of the APP G modeling methodology.

I agree fully with all of the above comments and would like to add these:

  *   Even buildings that are commissioned properly will see their performance erode over time.  There are hundreds of reason for this, ranging from poor maintenance to well-intentioned maintenance people not having time to monitor operations well.  There is NO BUILDING that operates well for long.
  *   Buildings often see changes in operation, occupancy and schedule.  These are oftimes gradual changes over a period of years, but can be substantial

Climate files used in the simulations versus the actual weather.

I?m in the midst of a project that shows a variance in EUI of up to 200% just by changing the climate file for the DOE primary school.  Full results to be presented in September.

Add in all the other factors already mentioned, and if your 90.1 model comes anywhere close the real buildings? it?s far more likely that the 90.1 model was extremely ?lucky? than it is that the model used accurate assumptions.

Jacob,

Happy to hear that other people are thinking the same.

I was into this subject on my own thoughts recently.

I would like to add in your list: Occupants' behavior actually which is not in the stage to be included into the prediction.
I would add commissioning as well along with controls simulation and controls operation.

Apologies because I haven't worked with LEED projects but I think the above applied in general to "the performance gap".

Really looking forward to hearing more about this subject as I am not that experienced engineer yet, but really interested in "the performance" side of buildings.

Bldg-Sim Community ?

I?m trying to compile a list of why it might be inappropriate to compare Appendix G models to actual consumption data.  This comes about because I recently got into a debate with one of my co-workers when looking at the infamous NBI chart/study that shows little correlation to predicted and actual energy values of LEED buildings.  I was trying to explain that the Appendix G model?s intent is NOT to be compared to actual consumption, as it is a modeling protocol aimed at creating consistent relative comparisons for LEED points.

Here are the reasons thus far that support this notion (that App G models shouldn?t be compared to actual data).  Does anyone know of any resources out there that expand upon this?  Or can you think other reasons?


-          Appendix G does not take into account external shading, which can be critical in urban environments for accurate energy predictions

-          Schedules are typically not created with the intent of being predictive.  Overall building hours are adhered to, but detailed schedule creation is not usually in the scope of a LEED model (or is it, in your experience?).  For instance, typical plug load base values during unoccupied times are .3, this is a pretty big assumption.

-          The App G model uses a TMY weather file, which can vary from the current weather year (I wonder on average by how much?)

-          Infiltration values are assumed, unless blower door testing has been done (which is rare for commercial buildings).

-          Thermostat values are modeled as consistent across the building, which is rarely the case in an actual operating building

Any additional insight is much appreciated!

Message-ID: <2103208961.192211.1432711086728.JavaMail.yahoo@mail.yahoo.com>

Dear All,
I worked on a couple of projects in equest? using the VRF performance curves from Daikin and LG. The methodology i followed is as below:
1) Modelled packaged VAV with minimum flow ratio 1. 
2) Created systems based on number of ODU's and assigned multiple zones to the respective ODU. (Just like modelling a AHU)
3) Inputted the ODU Cooling capacity and supply flow4) Fans will be constant volume.5) Since it is a cooling only system, i assigned only the "Cool EIR - fEWB-OAT", "Cool-EIR-fPLR" and "Cool cap-fEWB&OAT" curves. Rest were all default DX unit curves.
?PVAV system is used as PSZ system cannot handle multiple zones well thus causing unmet hours.
I did 2 trials, one with default DX curves and the other with performance curves from LG and Daikin. The results showed a decrease in cooling energy consumption by more than 30% thus impacting the overall energy consumption by more than 10%. 

Is the simulation methodology and results appropriate? I feel the savings is on a higher side.
Please advise.

When I have modeled VRF systems I have always used the PVVT system type in eQUEST as recommended in this presentation: http://energytrust.org/library/bsug-files/modeling_real_performance_of_vrf_systems_kc-05.15.13.pdf

Using the efficiencies and the curves for the VRF system will get you pretty close, but if you want to account for heat-recovery within the system (one terminal unit in cooling while another is in heating), you will have to do some post-processing calculations.

5) Since it is a cooling only system, i assigned only the "Cool EIR - fEWB-OAT", "Cool-EIR-fPLR" and "Cool cap-fEWB&OAT" curves. Rest were all default DX unit curves.

 PVAV system is used as PSZ system cannot handle multiple zones well thus causing unmet hours.

I did 2 trials, one with default DX curves and the other with performance curves from LG and Daikin. The results showed a decrease in cooling energy consumption by more than 30% thus impacting the overall energy consumption by more than 10%.

Is the simulation methodology and results appropriate? I feel the savings is on a higher side.

Please advise.

Hi Rathna,
LG has a plug-in that works good with eQuest, I tried it and I noticed the % of energy saving will be on the region of 20% when compared to PTAC (Not compared to the App G. Baseline).

This is a slightly different question: 
How close do you expect 2 energy models to be created by 2 different modelers (using the same program) if you give them the same plans and information?

(Ask Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali and Rembrandt to draw a tree)

I assume most companies don't double up on the energy modeling efforts which would show how consistent or non-consistent energy models are. (assuming the energy modelers are experienced and competent.)

Somebody who teachers energy modeling may be able to provide insight and good examples.

As far as an energy model matching the actual utilities bills..... If you have a 1000 modelers, making models on 1000 computers for 1000 years......

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Re: [Bldg-sim] Comparing ASHRAE 90.1 App G Models to Real Buildings

Thank you all for your thoughtful insight on this matter!  It?s an important debate ? both in understanding the capabilities/limitations of our craft as energy modelers, but also to communicate our value to the community at large. 

 

To clarify slightly, my question revolved around how the specific modeling protocol of Appendix G could account for the ?performance? gap between modeled and actual use.  Thus, the fact that buildings aren?t operated as the energy model specified and the lack of building commissioning, while true and important, are not inherent to the intent of Appendix G modeling.  The most interesting question is, ?If you model a LEED App G model perfectly according to protocol, AND the building was operated according to the modeled schedules, will it predict the right number??  Lots of your responses lent insight into this question, thanks again!  

 

I?ve revised my list below based on your responses:

 

Added:

-   Plug load values are assumed, which can have a huge impact on overall energy (Thanks Christoph and Chris Hadlock for the insight)

-  Insulation values are largely specified without thought to thermal bridging

-  HVAC controls simulation is often simplified

- Performance curves are often not simulated due to increased effort and unavailability of performance data from manufacturers

 

Original:

-          Appendix G does not take into account external shading, which can be critical in urban environments for accurate energy predictions

-          Schedules are typically not created with the intent of being predictive.  Overall building hours are adhered to, but detailed schedule creation is not usually in the scope of a LEED model (or is it, in your experience?).  For instance, typical plug load base values during unoccupied times are .3, this is a pretty big assumption.

-          The App G model uses a TMY weather file, which can vary from the current weather year (I wonder on average by how much?)

-          Infiltration values are assumed, unless blower door testing has been done (which is rare for commercial buildings).

-          Thermostat values are modeled as consistent across the building, which is rarely the case in an actual operating building

All,

 

I would agree with all of the factors mentioned that absolutely can result in deviations between actual and modeled building performance. I would also echo the sentiment that following modeling rules shouldn't necessarily preclude us from attempting to better predict actual building performance through the LEED process. Applying careful attention to important details and a healthy dose of experience (bringing together real life building performance knowledge as it relates to the grey areas - namely schedules, equipment controls, occupant behavior, etc) can truly help close the gap. At the end of the day, a rating system should be attempting to reward buildings that actually perform well, not theoretically perform well (and as modeler's we should take a leading role in making good (i.e. fair) assumptions).

 

My colleague (Janine Vanry) has recently completed research (to be published soon) for her masters thesis at the University of Waterloo (Ontario, Canada) which studied how LEED certified academic buildings in southwestern Ontario performed in comparison to government energy intensity benchmarks, campus-wide energy intensities, and in general how LEED (modeled) results compare to actual building performance (as measured through M&V). Consistent with Dr Samuelson's (et al.) research findings, the discrepancies between the modeled results and the actual energy intensities showed that there was an under-prediction anywhere from 2% to 44%. 

 

While energy modeling professionals understand (as is evident by this thread) that there will be differences between the documented EAc1 energy savings and actual building energy usage, this isn't always communicated and understood by the building owners and the professionals we work with.

	Dear Jacob,

	 

	This is an eternal debate and there are many reasons for moving away from the use of 90.1 Appendix G to evaluate the performance of a building designs.  To answer your question directly, we worked a few years ago with Enermodal in Canada on a comparison between design phase building energy models (BEM) prepared for LEED Canada certification (slightly different to Appendix G) to calibrated BEM and measured energy use for 18 buildings. The main findings are quoted below:

	This paper evaluates the accuracy of 18 design-phase building energy models, built according to LEED Canada protocol, and investigates the effectiveness of model calibration steps to improve simulation predictions with respect to measured energy data. These calibration steps, applied in professional practice, included inputting actual weather data, adding unregulated loads, revising plug loads (often with submetered data), and other simple updates. In sum, the design-phase energy models underpredicted the total measured energy consumption by 36%. Following the calibration steps, this error was reduced to a net 7% underprediction. For the monthly energy use intensity (EUI), the coefficient of variation of the root mean square error improved from 45% to 24%. Revising plug loads made the largest impact in these cases. This step increased the EUI by 15% median (32% mean) in the models. This impact far exceeded that of calibrating the weather data, even in a sensitivity test using extreme weather years.

	I agree fully with all of the above comments and would like to add these:

	*	Even buildings that are commissioned properly will see their performance erode over time.  There are hundreds of reason for this, ranging from poor maintenance to well-intentioned maintenance people not having time to monitor operations well.  There is NO BUILDING that operates well for long.
	*	Buildings often see changes in operation, occupancy and schedule.  These are oftimes gradual changes over a period of years, but can be substantial

	I?m in the midst of a project that shows a variance in EUI of up to 200% just by changing the climate file for the DOE primary school.  Full results to be presented in September.

	 

	Add in all the other factors already mentioned, and if your 90.1 model comes anywhere close the real buildings? it?s far more likely that the 90.1 model was extremely ?lucky? than it is that the model used accurate assumptions.

	Jacob,

	 

	Happy to hear that other people are thinking the same. 

	 

	I was into this subject on my own thoughts recently.

	 

	I would like to add in your list: Occupants' behavior actually which is not in the stage to be included into the prediction.

	I would add commissioning as well along with controls simulation and controls operation.

	 

	Apologies because I haven't worked with LEED projects but I think the above applied in general to "the performance gap".

	 

	Really looking forward to hearing more about this subject as I am not that experienced engineer yet, but really interested in "the performance" side of buildings.

		Bldg-Sim Community ? 

		 

		I?m trying to compile a list of why it might be inappropriate to compare Appendix G models to actual consumption data.  This comes about because I recently got into a debate with one of my co-workers when looking at the infamous NBI chart/study that shows little correlation to predicted and actual energy values of LEED buildings.  I was trying to explain that the Appendix G model?s intent is NOT to be compared to actual consumption, as it is a modeling protocol aimed at creating consistent relative comparisons for LEED points. 

		 

		Here are the reasons thus far that support this notion (that App G models shouldn?t be compared to actual data).  Does anyone know of any resources out there that expand upon this?  Or can you think other reasons?

		 

		-          Appendix G does not take into account external shading, which can be critical in urban environments for accurate energy predictions

		-          Schedules are typically not created with the intent of being predictive.  Overall building hours are adhered to, but detailed schedule creation is not usually in the scope of a LEED model (or is it, in your experience?).  For instance, typical plug load base values during unoccupied times are .3, this is a pretty big assumption.

		-          The App G model uses a TMY weather file, which can vary from the current weather year (I wonder on average by how much?)

		-          Infiltration values are assumed, unless blower door testing has been done (which is rare for commercial buildings).

		-          Thermostat values are modeled as consistent across the building, which is rarely the case in an actual operating building

		 

		Any additional insight is much appreciated!

Just catching up with this thread so I'm sorry if I'm repeating anything that's already been mentioned. 

Take a look at the paper from Pam Berkeley et al published last year at SimBuild. 
https://www.ashrae.org/membership--conferences/conferences/ashrae-ibpsa-usa-papers

10 experienced energy modelers modeling the same building in a 3hr period. Fascinating results. 


There are emerging methods to do more rigorous QC using a variation on Monte Carlo for energy models to calculate a confidence interval for the model rather than fully rely on modeler experience and 3rd party QC. Georgia Tech has integrated this into their version of e+, which I hope gets integrated into a future version of e+. It's computationally intense so cloud computing is probably the right way to do this, which I believe e+ is heading towards.

This is a slightly different question: 
How close do you expect 2 energy models to be created by 2 different modelers (using the same program) if you give them the same plans and information?

(Ask Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali and Rembrandt to draw a tree)

I assume most companies don't double up on the energy modeling efforts which would show how consistent or non-consistent energy models are. (assuming the energy modelers are experienced and competent.)

Somebody who teachers energy modeling may be able to provide insight and good examples.

As far as an energy model matching the actual utilities bills..... If you have a 1000 modelers, making models on 1000 computers for 1000 years......

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Re: [Bldg-sim] Comparing ASHRAE 90.1 App G Models to Real Buildings

Thank you all for your thoughtful insight on this matter!  It?s an important debate ? both in understanding the capabilities/limitations of our craft as energy modelers, but also to communicate our value to the community at large. 

 

To clarify slightly, my question revolved around how the specific modeling protocol of Appendix G could account for the ?performance? gap between modeled and actual use.  Thus, the fact that buildings aren?t operated as the energy model specified and the lack of building commissioning, while true and important, are not inherent to the intent of Appendix G modeling.  The most interesting question is, ?If you model a LEED App G model perfectly according to protocol, AND the building was operated according to the modeled schedules, will it predict the right number??  Lots of your responses lent insight into this question, thanks again!  

 

I?ve revised my list below based on your responses:

 

Added:

-   Plug load values are assumed, which can have a huge impact on overall energy (Thanks Christoph and Chris Hadlock for the insight)

-  Insulation values are largely specified without thought to thermal bridging

-  HVAC controls simulation is often simplified

- Performance curves are often not simulated due to increased effort and unavailability of performance data from manufacturers

 

Original:

-          Appendix G does not take into account external shading, which can be critical in urban environments for accurate energy predictions

-          Schedules are typically not created with the intent of being predictive.  Overall building hours are adhered to, but detailed schedule creation is not usually in the scope of a LEED model (or is it, in your experience?).  For instance, typical plug load base values during unoccupied times are .3, this is a pretty big assumption.

-          The App G model uses a TMY weather file, which can vary from the current weather year (I wonder on average by how much?)

-          Infiltration values are assumed, unless blower door testing has been done (which is rare for commercial buildings).

-          Thermostat values are modeled as consistent across the building, which is rarely the case in an actual operating building

All,

 

I would agree with all of the factors mentioned that absolutely can result in deviations between actual and modeled building performance. I would also echo the sentiment that following modeling rules shouldn't necessarily preclude us from attempting to better predict actual building performance through the LEED process. Applying careful attention to important details and a healthy dose of experience (bringing together real life building performance knowledge as it relates to the grey areas - namely schedules, equipment controls, occupant behavior, etc) can truly help close the gap. At the end of the day, a rating system should be attempting to reward buildings that actually perform well, not theoretically perform well (and as modeler's we should take a leading role in making good (i.e. fair) assumptions).

 

My colleague (Janine Vanry) has recently completed research (to be published soon) for her masters thesis at the University of Waterloo (Ontario, Canada) which studied how LEED certified academic buildings in southwestern Ontario performed in comparison to government energy intensity benchmarks, campus-wide energy intensities, and in general how LEED (modeled) results compare to actual building performance (as measured through M&V). Consistent with Dr Samuelson's (et al.) research findings, the discrepancies between the modeled results and the actual energy intensities showed that there was an under-prediction anywhere from 2% to 44%. 

 

While energy modeling professionals understand (as is evident by this thread) that there will be differences between the documented EAc1 energy savings and actual building energy usage, this isn't always communicated and understood by the building owners and the professionals we work with.

	Dear Jacob,

	 

	This is an eternal debate and there are many reasons for moving away from the use of 90.1 Appendix G to evaluate the performance of a building designs.  To answer your question directly, we worked a few years ago with Enermodal in Canada on a comparison between design phase building energy models (BEM) prepared for LEED Canada certification (slightly different to Appendix G) to calibrated BEM and measured energy use for 18 buildings. The main findings are quoted below:

	This paper evaluates the accuracy of 18 design-phase building energy models, built according to LEED Canada protocol, and investigates the effectiveness of model calibration steps to improve simulation predictions with respect to measured energy data. These calibration steps, applied in professional practice, included inputting actual weather data, adding unregulated loads, revising plug loads (often with submetered data), and other simple updates. In sum, the design-phase energy models underpredicted the total measured energy consumption by 36%. Following the calibration steps, this error was reduced to a net 7% underprediction. For the monthly energy use intensity (EUI), the coefficient of variation of the root mean square error improved from 45% to 24%. Revising plug loads made the largest impact in these cases. This step increased the EUI by 15% median (32% mean) in the models. This impact far exceeded that of calibrating the weather data, even in a sensitivity test using extreme weather years.

	I agree fully with all of the above comments and would like to add these:

	*	Even buildings that are commissioned properly will see their performance erode over time.  There are hundreds of reason for this, ranging from poor maintenance to well-intentioned maintenance people not having time to monitor operations well.  There is NO BUILDING that operates well for long.
	*	Buildings often see changes in operation, occupancy and schedule.  These are oftimes gradual changes over a period of years, but can be substantial

	I?m in the midst of a project that shows a variance in EUI of up to 200% just by changing the climate file for the DOE primary school.  Full results to be presented in September.

	 

	Add in all the other factors already mentioned, and if your 90.1 model comes anywhere close the real buildings? it?s far more likely that the 90.1 model was extremely ?lucky? than it is that the model used accurate assumptions.

	Jacob,

	 

	Happy to hear that other people are thinking the same. 

	 

	I was into this subject on my own thoughts recently.

	 

	I would like to add in your list: Occupants' behavior actually which is not in the stage to be included into the prediction.

	I would add commissioning as well along with controls simulation and controls operation.

	 

	Apologies because I haven't worked with LEED projects but I think the above applied in general to "the performance gap".

	 

	Really looking forward to hearing more about this subject as I am not that experienced engineer yet, but really interested in "the performance" side of buildings.

		Bldg-Sim Community ? 

		 

		I?m trying to compile a list of why it might be inappropriate to compare Appendix G models to actual consumption data.  This comes about because I recently got into a debate with one of my co-workers when looking at the infamous NBI chart/study that shows little correlation to predicted and actual energy values of LEED buildings.  I was trying to explain that the Appendix G model?s intent is NOT to be compared to actual consumption, as it is a modeling protocol aimed at creating consistent relative comparisons for LEED points. 

		 

		Here are the reasons thus far that support this notion (that App G models shouldn?t be compared to actual data).  Does anyone know of any resources out there that expand upon this?  Or can you think other reasons?

		 

		-          Appendix G does not take into account external shading, which can be critical in urban environments for accurate energy predictions

		-          Schedules are typically not created with the intent of being predictive.  Overall building hours are adhered to, but detailed schedule creation is not usually in the scope of a LEED model (or is it, in your experience?).  For instance, typical plug load base values during unoccupied times are .3, this is a pretty big assumption.

		-          The App G model uses a TMY weather file, which can vary from the current weather year (I wonder on average by how much?)

		-          Infiltration values are assumed, unless blower door testing has been done (which is rare for commercial buildings).

		-          Thermostat values are modeled as consistent across the building, which is rarely the case in an actual operating building

		 

		Any additional insight is much appreciated!

Models are never going to agree, but that doesn't mean they aren't powerful
tools for decision-making. Look at the ASHRAE 140 results for highly
simplified geometries with different engines. Things easily vary by 20%.
Hell, things vary by 20% just between some versions of the same tool. I
didn't see it mentioned that the underlying models just aren't going to
give you the "right" answer.

That's why we need to calibrate. The models are not generally actually
calculating things based on first principles. They use shortcuts for
computation time and ease of specification everywhere. That's why it's no
less real for me to impose some sort of somewhat goofy setpoint schedule to
get things to work out well in the calibration of my model. Ideally, we'd
calibrate to one set of bills and then run it against a second set of bills
to see if we over-calibrated the models (the same as over-fitting a
regression model). Instead of arguing whether or not the models are right,
we should be going back to the fundamental question of whether or not the
models provide useful decision-making information, i.e. whether or not they
get the first order impacts right for different kinds of design choices in
new construction. Remember that uncertainty around each point and move
ahead making the design decisions you need to make.

There's still plenty of room to develop better analysis practices that will
improve the design decisions we make. I would love to see a study looking
at normalized consumption and key characteristics of 5-year-old commercial
buildings, and then again at 10-year-old commercial buildings. You could do
this with LEED submittals and regress against the ECMs included and other
characteristics. You wouldn't necessarily get to the why of how the
buildings failed to deliver without a lot of extra work, but I think you
could get the what just by looking at bills and data. You could also do
this on the residential side. We have some utility clients who run
commercial or residential new construction programs. Theoretically, we
could get bills and characteristics for a large number buildings and
regress. I know that would work on the residential side. On the commercial
side, I don't know if there is enough participant data.  Others should
consider doing the same. It would be a fascinating study and would make for
a great energy nerd parlor game. Which of these measures just didn't
deliver?

My gut says that failures in fancy control systems are to blame for the
most egregious differences. There are so many failure points -- sensors,
valves, dampers, actuators, not to mention the likelihood of a mistake in
the controls sequence. You need somebody on top of monitoring for each of
those potential failure points and correcting them. My gut also says that
good solid basic design will deliver the savings. Cutting down on
west-facing solar gains will save cooling energy. Installing more efficient
HVAC equipment, given solid ratings information, will also work. More
efficient lighting designs will work. Really fancy stuff will fail some of
the time. And some of the time it will work! And we need to celebrate those
pieces that work!

I don't think the primary cause of discrepancy between simulations and measured data are 
the algorithms (although they do play a part), but much more the input assumptions.  I 
also agree that more calibration should be done, not so much to tune an individual model, 
which can easily be taken to a meaningless excess, but more to gain insight into which 
input assumptions or defaults are most questionable and need revision of the "conventional 
wisdom".  A case in point is how much shading from drapes, blinds, and other obstructions 
should be assumed?  For many years, I've seen and used a SHADING-FRACTION of 0.60, i.e., 
40% of the incident solar is being obstructed, but is that really the best average value ? 
(this will likely vary by simulation program).

When this issue of how reliable are simulations was raised at a DOE-sponsored workshop in 
Jan. 2012 following the ASHRAE conference in San Antonio, and someone put up the 
proverbial plot of simulations vs measured for LEED buildings showing a huge cloud, I had 
suggested that we should tackle the calibration process in steps:
    1.  original ASHRAE-90.1 model vs measured
    2.  1 from above corrected to as built and operated (including actual weather!) vs 
measured
    3.  2 from above with end-use metered data vs measured, plus tuning the model
1 would be what we're doing now.  2 is eminently doable by onsite visit to the actual 
building. 3 would require much more instrumentation and manpower, and only doable as a 
research project.
What I would like to see is how much do the correlations improve going to 2 and then 3.  
My gut feeling is that the standard deviations would be halved each time, i.e., from 40% 
to 20% to 10%.

I've actually thought of turning this idea into an ASHRAE WS (RFP), and might still do it, 
time and energy permitting. What I envision is for some contractor to get a healthy number 
of ASHRAE 90.1 models (~30-40), possibly submitted for LEED, and then apply the same 
methodology to get 2, and pick a few (~5) that would be monitored for 3.  If there are any 
ASHRAE members or friends interested to flush out such a WS,  please send me an e-mail.

Interesting post and thanks for the info - I find VRF a bit of a 'black
box' when it comes to modelling. Part of the issue is the huge variety of
indoor/ outdoor unit combinations.

I have no doubt that the better VRF systems are a superb technology.
However, I do believe some of the performance claims are audacious (I can
only speak of the European market). For example, heat recovery VRF with
seasonal average heating COP (kW/kW)  > 8.0 and seasonal Cooling EER > 6 is
competing with centrifugal chillers - the most advanced VRF compressor
technology I know of is scroll.

I guess part of my beef is not trusting the Euro test standards for VRF!

Bye for now

Dear All,
Thanks a lot for all the responses. I followed the procedure outlined in the LG guide. The overall savings are up by 13%, savings on cooling alone is up by 35% when compared to the default DX curves. Of course there is unmet hour issue as i have considered PSZ system.
Also i tried a few trials to understand which particular curve is responsible for the higher savings and found that "f(t entering wet bulb, t enter condenser) curve gives higher savings. And then changing the cooling capacity curve provides additional savings. The least impact is from the PLR curve.
Now the question is whether the savings achieved is justifiable. Has anyone else come across the same issue?.
I am concerned about the savings because, in a core and shell project, with DX curves the project is achieving 5% savings and once i input the VRF curves, the savings shoots to more than 15%. Meeting LEED mandatory is dependent on the VRF curves.?
I am working on Equest software.?

Just catching up with this thread so I'm sorry if I'm repeating anything that's already been mentioned. 

Take a look at the paper from Pam Berkeley et al published last year at SimBuild. 
https://www.ashrae.org/membership--conferences/conferences/ashrae-ibpsa-usa-papers

10 experienced energy modelers modeling the same building in a 3hr period. Fascinating results. 


There are emerging methods to do more rigorous QC using a variation on Monte Carlo for energy models to calculate a confidence interval for the model rather than fully rely on modeler experience and 3rd party QC. Georgia Tech has integrated this into their version of e+, which I hope gets integrated into a future version of e+. It's computationally intense so cloud computing is probably the right way to do this, which I believe e+ is heading towards.

This is a slightly different question: 
How close do you expect 2 energy models to be created by 2 different modelers (using the same program) if you give them the same plans and information?

(Ask Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali and Rembrandt to draw a tree)

I assume most companies don't double up on the energy modeling efforts which would show how consistent or non-consistent energy models are. (assuming the energy modelers are experienced and competent.)

Somebody who teachers energy modeling may be able to provide insight and good examples.

As far as an energy model matching the actual utilities bills..... If you have a 1000 modelers, making models on 1000 computers for 1000 years......

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Re: [Bldg-sim] Comparing ASHRAE 90.1 App G Models to Real Buildings

Thank you all for your thoughtful insight on this matter!  It?s an important debate ? both in understanding the capabilities/limitations of our craft as energy modelers, but also to communicate our value to the community at large. 

 

To clarify slightly, my question revolved around how the specific modeling protocol of Appendix G could account for the ?performance? gap between modeled and actual use.  Thus, the fact that buildings aren?t operated as the energy model specified and the lack of building commissioning, while true and important, are not inherent to the intent of Appendix G modeling.  The most interesting question is, ?If you model a LEED App G model perfectly according to protocol, AND the building was operated according to the modeled schedules, will it predict the right number??  Lots of your responses lent insight into this question, thanks again!  

 

I?ve revised my list below based on your responses:

 

Added:

-   Plug load values are assumed, which can have a huge impact on overall energy (Thanks Christoph and Chris Hadlock for the insight)

-  Insulation values are largely specified without thought to thermal bridging

-  HVAC controls simulation is often simplified

- Performance curves are often not simulated due to increased effort and unavailability of performance data from manufacturers

 

Original:

-          Appendix G does not take into account external shading, which can be critical in urban environments for accurate energy predictions

-          Schedules are typically not created with the intent of being predictive.  Overall building hours are adhered to, but detailed schedule creation is not usually in the scope of a LEED model (or is it, in your experience?).  For instance, typical plug load base values during unoccupied times are .3, this is a pretty big assumption.

-          The App G model uses a TMY weather file, which can vary from the current weather year (I wonder on average by how much?)

-          Infiltration values are assumed, unless blower door testing has been done (which is rare for commercial buildings).

-          Thermostat values are modeled as consistent across the building, which is rarely the case in an actual operating building

Cheers,

All,

 

I would agree with all of the factors mentioned that absolutely can result in deviations between actual and modeled building performance. I would also echo the sentiment that following modeling rules shouldn't necessarily preclude us from attempting to better predict actual building performance through the LEED process. Applying careful attention to important details and a healthy dose of experience (bringing together real life building performance knowledge as it relates to the grey areas - namely schedules, equipment controls, occupant behavior, etc) can truly help close the gap. At the end of the day, a rating system should be attempting to reward buildings that actually perform well, not theoretically perform well (and as modeler's we should take a leading role in making good (i.e. fair) assumptions).

 

My colleague (Janine Vanry) has recently completed research (to be published soon) for her masters thesis at the University of Waterloo (Ontario, Canada) which studied how LEED certified academic buildings in southwestern Ontario performed in comparison to government energy intensity benchmarks, campus-wide energy intensities, and in general how LEED (modeled) results compare to actual building performance (as measured through M&V). Consistent with Dr Samuelson's (et al.) research findings, the discrepancies between the modeled results and the actual energy intensities showed that there was an under-prediction anywhere from 2% to 44%. 

 

While energy modeling professionals understand (as is evident by this thread) that there will be differences between the documented EAc1 energy savings and actual building energy usage, this isn't always communicated and understood by the building owners and the professionals we work with.

	Dear Jacob,

	 

	This is an eternal debate and there are many reasons for moving away from the use of 90.1 Appendix G to evaluate the performance of a building designs.  To answer your question directly, we worked a few years ago with Enermodal in Canada on a comparison between design phase building energy models (BEM) prepared for LEED Canada certification (slightly different to Appendix G) to calibrated BEM and measured energy use for 18 buildings. The main findings are quoted below:

	This paper evaluates the accuracy of 18 design-phase building energy models, built according to LEED Canada protocol, and investigates the effectiveness of model calibration steps to improve simulation predictions with respect to measured energy data. These calibration steps, applied in professional practice, included inputting actual weather data, adding unregulated loads, revising plug loads (often with submetered data), and other simple updates. In sum, the design-phase energy models underpredicted the total measured energy consumption by 36%. Following the calibration steps, this error was reduced to a net 7% underprediction. For the monthly energy use intensity (EUI), the coefficient of variation of the root mean square error improved from 45% to 24%. Revising plug loads made the largest impact in these cases. This step increased the EUI by 15% median (32% mean) in the models. This impact far exceeded that of calibrating the weather data, even in a sensitivity test using extreme weather years.

	I believe Appendix G is not meant to measure the performance of the existing building. ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G Technical Committee is the right source to answer this question. They can clarify the intention of the APP G modeling methodology.

	I agree fully with all of the above comments and would like to add these:

	*	Even buildings that are commissioned properly will see their performance erode over time.  There are hundreds of reason for this, ranging from poor maintenance to well-intentioned maintenance people not having time to monitor operations well.  There is NO BUILDING that operates well for long.
	*	Buildings often see changes in operation, occupancy and schedule.  These are oftimes gradual changes over a period of years, but can be substantial

	I?m in the midst of a project that shows a variance in EUI of up to 200% just by changing the climate file for the DOE primary school.  Full results to be presented in September.

	 

	Add in all the other factors already mentioned, and if your 90.1 model comes anywhere close the real buildings? it?s far more likely that the 90.1 model was extremely ?lucky? than it is that the model used accurate assumptions.

	Jacob,

	 

	Happy to hear that other people are thinking the same. 

	 

	I was into this subject on my own thoughts recently.

	 

	I would like to add in your list: Occupants' behavior actually which is not in the stage to be included into the prediction.

	I would add commissioning as well along with controls simulation and controls operation.

	 

	Apologies because I haven't worked with LEED projects but I think the above applied in general to "the performance gap".

	 

	Really looking forward to hearing more about this subject as I am not that experienced engineer yet, but really interested in "the performance" side of buildings.

	 

	Best,

	Maria-Lida Kounadi

		Bldg-Sim Community ? 

		 

		I?m trying to compile a list of why it might be inappropriate to compare Appendix G models to actual consumption data.  This comes about because I recently got into a debate with one of my co-workers when looking at the infamous NBI chart/study that shows little correlation to predicted and actual energy values of LEED buildings.  I was trying to explain that the Appendix G model?s intent is NOT to be compared to actual consumption, as it is a modeling protocol aimed at creating consistent relative comparisons for LEED points. 

		 

		Here are the reasons thus far that support this notion (that App G models shouldn?t be compared to actual data).  Does anyone know of any resources out there that expand upon this?  Or can you think other reasons?

		 

		-          Appendix G does not take into account external shading, which can be critical in urban environments for accurate energy predictions

		-          Schedules are typically not created with the intent of being predictive.  Overall building hours are adhered to, but detailed schedule creation is not usually in the scope of a LEED model (or is it, in your experience?).  For instance, typical plug load base values during unoccupied times are .3, this is a pretty big assumption.

		-          The App G model uses a TMY weather file, which can vary from the current weather year (I wonder on average by how much?)

		-          Infiltration values are assumed, unless blower door testing has been done (which is rare for commercial buildings).

		-          Thermostat values are modeled as consistent across the building, which is rarely the case in an actual operating building

		 

		Any additional insight is much appreciated!

Just catching up with this thread so I'm sorry if I'm repeating anything that's already been mentioned. 

Take a look at the paper from Pam Berkeley et al published last year at SimBuild. 
https://www.ashrae.org/membership--conferences/conferences/ashrae-ibpsa-usa-papers

10 experienced energy modelers modeling the same building in a 3hr period. Fascinating results. 


There are emerging methods to do more rigorous QC using a variation on Monte Carlo for energy models to calculate a confidence interval for the model rather than fully rely on modeler experience and 3rd party QC. Georgia Tech has integrated this into their version of e+, which I hope gets integrated into a future version of e+. It's computationally intense so cloud computing is probably the right way to do this, which I believe e+ is heading towards.

This is a slightly different question: 
How close do you expect 2 energy models to be created by 2 different modelers (using the same program) if you give them the same plans and information?

(Ask Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali and Rembrandt to draw a tree)

I assume most companies don't double up on the energy modeling efforts which would show how consistent or non-consistent energy models are. (assuming the energy modelers are experienced and competent.)

Somebody who teachers energy modeling may be able to provide insight and good examples.

As far as an energy model matching the actual utilities bills..... If you have a 1000 modelers, making models on 1000 computers for 1000 years......

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Re: [Bldg-sim] Comparing ASHRAE 90.1 App G Models to Real Buildings

Thank you all for your thoughtful insight on this matter!  It?s an important debate ? both in understanding the capabilities/limitations of our craft as energy modelers, but also to communicate our value to the community at large. 

 

To clarify slightly, my question revolved around how the specific modeling protocol of Appendix G could account for the ?performance? gap between modeled and actual use.  Thus, the fact that buildings aren?t operated as the energy model specified and the lack of building commissioning, while true and important, are not inherent to the intent of Appendix G modeling.  The most interesting question is, ?If you model a LEED App G model perfectly according to protocol, AND the building was operated according to the modeled schedules, will it predict the right number??  Lots of your responses lent insight into this question, thanks again!  

 

I?ve revised my list below based on your responses:

 

Added:

-   Plug load values are assumed, which can have a huge impact on overall energy (Thanks Christoph and Chris Hadlock for the insight)

-  Insulation values are largely specified without thought to thermal bridging

-  HVAC controls simulation is often simplified

- Performance curves are often not simulated due to increased effort and unavailability of performance data from manufacturers

 

Original:

-          Appendix G does not take into account external shading, which can be critical in urban environments for accurate energy predictions

-          Schedules are typically not created with the intent of being predictive.  Overall building hours are adhered to, but detailed schedule creation is not usually in the scope of a LEED model (or is it, in your experience?).  For instance, typical plug load base values during unoccupied times are .3, this is a pretty big assumption.

All,

 

I would agree with all of the factors mentioned that absolutely can result in deviations between actual and modeled building performance. I would also echo the sentiment that following modeling rules shouldn't necessarily preclude us from attempting to better predict actual building performance through the LEED process. Applying careful attention to important details and a healthy dose of experience (bringing together real life building performance knowledge as it relates to the grey areas - namely schedules, equipment controls, occupant behavior, etc) can truly help close the gap. At the end of the day, a rating system should be attempting to reward buildings that actually perform well, not theoretically perform well (and as modeler's we should take a leading role in making good (i.e. fair) assumptions).

 

My colleague (Janine Vanry) has recently completed research (to be published soon) for her masters thesis at the University of Waterloo (Ontario, Canada) which studied how LEED certified academic buildings in southwestern Ontario performed in comparison to government energy intensity benchmarks, campus-wide energy intensities, and in general how LEED (modeled) results compare to actual building performance (as measured through M&V). Consistent with Dr Samuelson's (et al.) research findings, the discrepancies between the modeled results and the actual energy intensities showed that there was an under-prediction anywhere from 2% to 44%. 

 

While energy modeling professionals understand (as is evident by this thread) that there will be differences between the documented EAc1 energy savings and actual building energy usage, this isn't always communicated and understood by the building owners and the professionals we work with.

 

Chris

	Dear Jacob,

	 

	This is an eternal debate and there are many reasons for moving away from the use of 90.1 Appendix G to evaluate the performance of a building designs.  To answer your question directly, we worked a few years ago with Enermodal in Canada on a comparison between design phase building energy models (BEM) prepared for LEED Canada certification (slightly different to Appendix G) to calibrated BEM and measured energy use for 18 buildings. The main findings are quoted below:

	 

	Analysis of a Simplified Calibration Procedure for 18 Design-Phase Building Energy Models

	This paper evaluates the accuracy of 18 design-phase building energy models, built according to LEED Canada protocol, and investigates the effectiveness of model calibration steps to improve simulation predictions with respect to measured energy data. These calibration steps, applied in professional practice, included inputting actual weather data, adding unregulated loads, revising plug loads (often with submetered data), and other simple updates. In sum, the design-phase energy models underpredicted the total measured energy consumption by 36%. Following the calibration steps, this error was reduced to a net 7% underprediction. For the monthly energy use intensity (EUI), the coefficient of variation of the root mean square error improved from 45% to 24%. Revising plug loads made the largest impact in these cases. This step increased the EUI by 15% median (32% mean) in the models. This impact far exceeded that of calibrating the weather data, even in a sensitivity test using extreme weather years.

	I agree fully with all of the above comments and would like to add these:

	*	Even buildings that are commissioned properly will see their performance erode over time.  There are hundreds of reason for this, ranging from poor maintenance to well-intentioned maintenance people not having time to monitor operations well.  There is NO BUILDING that operates well for long.
	*	Buildings often see changes in operation, occupancy and schedule.  These are oftimes gradual changes over a period of years, but can be substantial

	I?m in the midst of a project that shows a variance in EUI of up to 200% just by changing the climate file for the DOE primary school.  Full results to be presented in September.

	 

	Add in all the other factors already mentioned, and if your 90.1 model comes anywhere close the real buildings? it?s far more likely that the 90.1 model was extremely ?lucky? than it is that the model used accurate assumptions.

Good morning to all...

I have gone through what feels like every page of the ASHRAE Handbook of 
Fundamentals in search of "N=20" and N=50" extreme high temperature 
data.  I was told it was in the Handbook, but I cannot find it and I 
have spent the better part of two hours looking for it.  Numerous web 
searches have not yielded any results either.  If anyone is willing to 
help with this, I would very much appreciate it.  The job is for a data 
center, and they need the N=20 (described as a twenty year high 
temperature) and the N=50 (described as a fifty year high temperature) 
for design.

Any ideas?  Anybody?


Thanks!

Can't help you on the ASHRAE version of the data, but I'll bet Weather
Analytics has something.  THey seem to be a major weather data repository.
Another possibility is Joe Huang at White box, who is a weather wizard.

The weather data PDFs on the Fundamentals CD (packaged with the print 
volume) includes 20 and 50 year return period extreme dry bulb temps.  
On the CD, look in the folder DATA_TABLES_FOR_STATIONS folder.  There is 
also a map-based station finder.

A wealth of additional info can be derived with the WDView 5.0 product

The extreme values (n=5,10,20,50) are also present in the Energy Plus Weather (EPW) files at http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/weatherdata_about.cfm).  If you don't use EPW files regularly you might need to read the file definition

Thanks Paul,

I got on the site, but all it gives me are the TMY weather files in zip 
format.  That's great, and I have used those before, but the N=20 and 
N=50 data do not jump out at me.  I opened the EPW file with Energy 
Consultant, but N=20 & N=50 don't seem to be part of the package.  I 
opened the .ddy and .stat files with Notepad, and I still don't see the 
N=20 and N=50 data easily available.

So I'm doing something wrong.

Any help would be great.

I did buy the WDView product from ASHRAE, Chip.  It's on the way!

The increasing availability of historical time series from various 
sources makes it quite easy to extract the extreme high temperature for 
a time series. For example, NCDC's ISD (Integrated Surface Hourly 
Database) has time series for around 1,000 locations in the US that go 
back 30 years, and maybe 200 or so that go back even more.  There's also 
NREL's National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) 1961-1990, updated 
1991-2010. I know Version 1 also has temperature data, don't know about 
Version 2.

Since I have already processed the ISD for the whole world, if you tell 
me the location, I can get you the 20 year extreme (at no charge) just 
to show how easy that is.

Its in Chapter 14 of the 2013 Fundamentals.  You can see an example in
Table 1, page 14.2.  Third section is Extreme Annual Design Conditions with
min/max extremes for N=5, 10, 20, and 50 years.

For your specific location, you'll have to open up the CD-ROM that comes
with the Handbook.  The data in the Appendix (pages 14.19--> ) is a subset
of what can be found for each individual location on the CD-ROM.

I'm looking for a simple tool (preferably free!) to estimate an 
approximate split of hourly global solar irradiance into direct and 
diffuse components.

Any suggestions?

Thanks!

Hi Phil,

The gen_reindl program that comes with Daysim <http://daysim.ning.com/> 
does this pretty well, although it isn't documented on the Daysim 
website. Below is some info I sent to a student using global horizontal 
irradiation from our weather station for daylight simulation purposes.

First you need to create a tab separated text file of the format *m d    
h(decimal)    gh_irrad* like the below.

    4    22 8.333333333    107
    4    22    8.416666667    121
    4    22    8.5    137
    4    22    8.583333333    151
    4    22    8.666666667    159
    4    22    8.75    169
    4    22    8.833333333    178
    4    22    8.916666667    184

Then the gen_reindl program can be run. -l is longitude (west positive), 
-a is latitude (north positive) and -m is the time zone in a multiple of 
15 degrees from the meridian. The command below is for Singapore, and 
you note that it is in the wrong time zone. UTC+8 * 15 = -120, despite a 
-103.98 longitude.
 > gen_reindl -m -120 -l -103.98 -a 1.37 -i input.txt -o output.wea

After running the command, the output in the output.wea file looks like 
this,

    4 22 8.333 12 103
    4 22 8.417 14 116
    4 22 8.500 17 131
    4 22 8.583 19 144
    4 22 8.667 19 151
    4 22 8.750 19 161
    4 22 8.833 20 169
    4 22 8.917 19 175

Where the 4th column is direct normal irradiation the the 5th column is 
diffuse horizontal.

Best,
Alstan

(reposted with corrections and  omitting Zhang et al. 2004 paper that was too big)

I think what you're asking about is a Solar Model that splits the irradiation into direct 
and diffuse components.  There are a number of these models, and a good person to ask is 
right in your back yard  - Spencer Dutton, who wrote a paper, "The assessment of the 
accuracy of diffuse irradiation models and their potential impact on building simulation", 
Dutton and Shao, Proc eSim 2008 Conference, Quebec.

In the US, many people have used the Perez-Ineichen Model (Perez et al. 1990, "Modeling 
daylight availability and irradiance compoents from direct and global irradiance", Solar 
Energy, 44(5), pp. 271-289), although I have been troubled by the discontinuities that I 
saw in the direct normal, and eventually moved to a much simpler model that uses a 
Gompertz Function (Zhang et al. 2004. "A new method to separate horizontal solar radiation 
into direct and diffuse components", Proceedings, ISESAP 2004).

All of these direct/diffuse split models are based primarily on the ratio of the global to 
the extraterrestrial horizontal, i.e., when the ratio (Kbar) goes down, the diffuse 
fraction goes up.  What I like about the Gompertz Function model is that it's simple and 
direct (no pun intended), and just fits this relationship with a sigmoid function shaped 
like a slanted half-S, and can be coded up in 20 lines or so. I've attached a Fortran 
version coded up by a student with whom I was working at the time.

In fact, the most difficult part to implementing this simple model is that  you would 
still need to know the solar angle (COSZAV), which requires calculating the "Equation of 
Time", unless you can strip that from an EnergyPlus or DOE-2 output.

If you're not interested in doing any coding, you could try using the Weather.exe program 
that comes with EnergyPlus.  There, if you feed the input weather containing only the 
global horizontal and no other radiation data, the program will use the Perez-Ineichen 
Model to output the direct and diffuse components.  However, you should quality-check the 
results, since I've been asked several times over the years to look at outputs that didn't 
look and weren't right. Lastly, all US simulation programs assume that the solar is the 
aggregate over the previous time step,  not the average rate around the current time step, 
as is the convention in Europe and the UK.

Depending on your definition of simple, I'd recommend the R package 
solaR (https://oscarperpinan.github.io/solar/):

Here is the academic paper on solaR's capabilities, with a description 
of the function calcGO that you will likely be interested in.
http://www.jstatsoft.org/v50/i09/paper
