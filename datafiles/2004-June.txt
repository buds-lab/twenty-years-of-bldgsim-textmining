Raquel,

I recall having studied the issue in a graduate class in the late
60s early 70s. This was not a thorough study, just a classroom exercise.
As I recall, our reference was an article in a British lighting book
or journal, and the name Petherbridge comes to mind. This was well before
the "simulation era."
The problem has also been studied more recently. I vaguely recall an
ASHRAE research project (perhaps TC4.7) that addressed it.

So, I advise a little literature research work.  I just did a Google
 on "Pertherbridge lighting" (w/the quotes) and got a bunch of hits....

Good luck

Ed Sowell

Hi Raquel,

The following paper might be a good starting point. 

Issac Guedi Capeluto, "The influence of the urban environment on the
availability of daylighting in office buildings in Israel", Building and
Environment 38 (2003) 745 -752.

For your simulations you need to use Radiance as you want to investigate
specular reflectances from neighboring buildings. 

Instead of using the "standard" Radiance i.e. considering only one sky
condition at a time, you might further consider to use a "dynamic"
Radiance-based method such as Daysim or Adeline.

Dear All,
 we' re doing a research about simulation tools, now we've finished our simulation analysis but we would like to compare our results with a typical energy consumption data(kWh/m2 or kWh/m3) by end use. We are working on two types of case study : an office (3 floors, 1200m2, 90 people) and an detached house(2 floors, pitched roof,  220m2, 5 people) . Both of the examples have as installation a DX cooling with Gas furnace and they are located in Los Angeles.
Can you please tell us if you have any stardard that can be useful for us to compare with our results?
Thank you in advance for your disposability, we hope to hear from you soon.

With kind regards,
Francesca Altavilla and Barbara Vicari.

Just got back from vacation and saw your note.  As I
think an earlier note mentioned, to my knowledge there
is no certification program for simulation experts. 
It's an interesting thought though.  

For energy conservation work, the first choice is
professional engineering registration at the State
level.  

Another choice is the Certified Energy Manager (CEM)
registration from the Association of Energy Engineers.
 It involves a less rigorous test than for a PE and
some years of work in the energy conservation field.
Maintenance involves continuing education.  Contact
the AEE in Atlanta for further information.  The CEM
rating has had some success in being adopted at the
State and Federal level as a way to show credibility
in energy efficiency contracting work.  It is not an
alternative to professional engineer registration as
far as the preparation of engineering documents, etc. 


Depending on what you're working on, US Green Building
Council's LEED certification can also be worthwhile.  

Good Luck!

Miguel

Why did you use two blocks for two zones? A block can contain multiple
zones as long as they have the same space height and are adjacent to
each other.

By default, all perimeter walls of a block are exterior walls. With
VisualDOE 4.0, you can delete an exterior wall and change an exterior
wall to an interior wall.

MessageHello,

I am trying to compare the pros and cons of using either a waterside economizer or an airside economizer using DOE2.1E. A trivial exercise, however I was surprised to see the DOE reports water side economizer to be slightly more efficient. Which does not really make sense to me. Anyone can share her/his experience in dealing with economizers in DOE2.1E

 

Thank you,

Vikram,
 
I suggest you try and use DOE 2.2 v40 or higher.  Ver. 40 has included
~34 new keywords for modeling of ice rinks.  The keywords allow you to
specify ice conditions, resurfacing energy, air movement across ice from
skaters & HVAC, stratification of air immeadietly above ice surface,
ceiling conditions, a brine circulation loop and a sub-floor heating
loop.  
 
You can review the documentation on the doe2.com website.  Look for the
"DOE22Vol2 - Dictionary" reference manual.  
 
Good luck.

different kind of partitions, i.e., if i have to different walls between 
two zones it is possible to model just like this?
On the other side, if i model these two zones as two different blocks, 
despite the zones being together (they share a common wall), i think 
visual doe will treat the share wall as two different fa?ades ... to the 
exterior ...
In short, i have two thermal zones, sharing a common wall (composed by 
two different walls). How can i model this?
How can i resolve this difficulty?

Thanks for the help

Miguel

We faked this back in 1985 with DOE-2 at the CU Rec Center...had to get
around the minimum zone temperature for DOE-2 by increasing the UA for the
rink...worked pretty good...paper in the ASHRAE Transactions and MS thesis
on this.

Hi,

THis question is kind of a follow up to a conversation thread from last

how exactly to go about doing this.  Has anyone done this before?

John,
I have tried working around this in a number of ways and on a number of projects over the years.  While every project is unique, the best approximation in my opinion is to use the OA-FROM-SYSTEM command which passes return air (properties only not mass flow) from one system to another.  You assign the make up air system to a dummy zone with no loads and then need to control your supply temperature off a reset schedule.  Two problems / limitations are:
1) if your desired make up air temperature cannot be simplified to an outdoor air reset schedule then inaccuracies arise.  in this case run a couple of tests to bound the uncertainty.
2) if your tempering unit has bypass dampers to dehumidify while keeping dry bulb temperature elevated then this cannot be accurately represented in this case

If you are working in 2.1E and are familiar / adventurous with INPUT-FUNCTIONS then in theory you have ways to get around the problems above, but ...

I understand that Jeff Hirsch and gang may be working on adding in a better representation of minimum outdoor air / fresh air / make-up air systems.
Regards,
Graham

  I did such a DOE-2 run years ago, but now have forgotten how to do it.

  A building has outside air supplied by a tempering Makeup air (MAU) unit (could be anything-CHW or Package) to a plenum. All other building system draw from and return air to this plenum. The MAU has an economizer on it (or not).

  Does anyone have an example DOE-2 SYSTEMS input for this situation?

There is a roundabout way - You can use Weathermaker(by Energy 10) to
convert TMY2 to text files (comma delimited).You have to first convert
it into an energy 10 file & then to a text file. There might be an
easier way. The coma delimited format is great for XL though.

Pivot tables in excel work great for analyzing temperature bins by
different hours and months, and the text versions of the weather files
(EPW, or NREL TMYs) are easy to work with in excel.

Dear All,

SKYLIGHT PERFORMANCE SOFTWARE RELEASED

The Institute for Research in Construction (IRC) is pleased to announce the
release of the final version of SkyVision after feedback from experts and
stakeholders and an extensive validation testing on the beta versions
released last year.  SkyVision calculates the optical characteristics of
conventional and tubular skylights and predicts their indoor daylight
availability and energy saving potential.  The software can be downloaded
free of charge from: http://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ie/light/skyvision/. The
validation report is also available on the web, under the Publications
section. The report includes work carried out both at IRC and under the
California PIER program.  The final release includes additional features
compared to earlier beta-versions:  (1) Monitor skylights and vault
skylights with rounded edges are added to the modeled shapes. (2) More
Canadian and US weather data are added to the database. Users can also
import any international weather file in the Canadian (CWEC) or EnergyPlus
format (.EPW). A weather format converter is provided and a web link to the
DOE international weather data, which covers more than 550 locations, is
established within the software.  (3) Users can place skylights on the roof
using automatic distribution, or based on given spacing criteria.  (4) Added
step lighting control algorithms. (5) Fixes of reported bugs. (6) Some
enhancement of the graphical user interface.

Comments or suggestions are very useful and appreciated

I now need some time to sort through the many kind responses all have sent.
I do have my DOE-2 answer. So thanks to all.
 
I am currently between a rock and a hard place with my current management
than a bin spreadsheet gives just as good as information as a simulation, in
much less time. I would appreciate any responses, so I could show these
people how other parts of the world think.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] TMY2 Data Conversion to Bin Data
In-Reply-To: <MDAEMON-F200406141742.AA4238156pd80000199736@gard.com>

Yes...I have a program that converts TMY2 weather data to bin weather 
data.  I ask only $25 to license it. 

However, it does not use the binary versions of the TMY2 files that DOE2 
uses.  It requires the ASCII version of the TMY2 files.  These file are 
avainable for 239 US cities, FREE , thanks to the US government.

One of the big problems with bin weather data that has been previously 
published, is that it is usually not itemized for occupied hours vs 
unoccupied hours.  Or, if anything, it is itemized for three 8 hour 
periods each day.  My program allows you to specify the occupied hours 
and then creates 2 sets of bin weather data for the year...Occupied and 
Unoccupied.

My program also has a mode to extract the 8760 hours of temperature 
data, if that's what you really want.  I suspect that since this program 
does a good job of separating occupied bins from unoccupied bins, you 
won't need the 8760 weather data.

Hi building sim list -
 
In the never ending quest for the right answer, what is the list
consensus on the best manner in which to measure overall (seasonal)
efficiency of an old low-pressure steam boiler in place?
 
Clearly a pure combustion test bears little relation to the actual fuel
consumed as it does not account for stack loss, purge loss, skin losses
etc.
 
Anyone read or tried anything that can give some good methodology for
obtaining reasonable numbers.
 
Thanks in advance,

To the building sim community:
 
I am in agreement with Chris that the PE license is a more rigorous
certification than the CEM.  I let my CEM lapse after getting a PE in
Mechanical Engineering.  However, there are many people in this field
who are in the energy efficiency field who are not engineers and thus
will never obtain a PE.  
 
Frankly there are many positions in the energy efficiency field that
don't require a PE license.  As an example, a good lighting designer is
often more qualified than a PE to suggest an appropriate lighting
upgrade that improves visibility and energy efficiency.
 
The CEM test helps AEE sell the CEM course which gives people a good
rudimentary "lay of the land" of the big issues associated with energy
efficiency.  For some people this course will be too basic but for many
others, it is a good introduction to the field.
 
This course is worthwhile but does not replace an engineering degree and
work experience or a lighting design education and work experience.  
 
The bottom line is that when hiring an energy professional one has to
look at their relevant experience and if they are going to be doing a
lot of work or recommending a large expenditure, it would be worthwhile
to talk to their previous clients.

I agree with Tom. I am a PE, a Certified Energy Procurement Professional
through the AEE, and a LEED accredited professional by the US Green
Building Council. I have never pursued the CEM because I felt its value
was not very high. As Tom said, there are CEMs out there with very
little knowledge of real world energy efficiency practices.  In my
opinion the PE registration has much greater value, as it requires
rigorous testing and minimum experience criteria to achieve
registration. Although there PEs out there who are not particularly
talented engineers, the credibility of a PE is greater than that of a
CEM in the energy business.
 
I hope this is helpful. If you are new to the business, I encourage you
to pursue the CEM anyway, as it can not hurt to have it.

I agree with Tom. I am a PE, a Certified Energy Procurement Professional
through the AEE, and a LEED accredited professional by the US Green
Building Council. I have never pursued the CEM because I felt its value
was not very high. As Tom said, there are CEMs out there with very
little knowledge of real world energy efficiency practices.  In my
opinion the PE registration has much greater value, as it requires
rigorous testing and minimum experience criteria to achieve
registration. Although there PEs out there who are not particularly
talented engineers, the credibility of a PE is greater than that of a
CEM in the energy business.
 
I hope this is helpful. If you are new to the business, I encourage you
to pursue the CEM anyway, as it can not hurt to have it.

SimBuild 2004 
Building Sustainability and Performance Through Simulation
First National Conference of IBPSA-USA
August 4-6, 2004
Boulder, Colorado, USA
 <http://www.ibpsa.us/SimBuild2004> http://www.ibpsa.us/SimBuild2004 



SimBuild 2004 is the first in a series of biennial conferences organized by
IBPSA-USA to improve the design and operation of buildings through advances
in the modeling and simulation of building performance.  One feature of this
conference is a full day of program devoted to practical application of
simulation for sustainable building design, including USGBC LEED
certification.

The SimBuild 2004 conference seeks to bring together the full building
performance community: researchers and practitioners, software developers
and users, professionals and students, public and private sectors, designers
and operators, engineers and architects. Participants are also expected to
span the diverse disciplines of building performance, including energy
systems, acoustics, lighting and daylighting, air movement, indoor
envionmental quality, controls and operations, and performance under extreme
event conditions.

The program has been designed to include: 

*	Research presentations and poster sessions (peer reviewed) 

*	Technical presentations (not peer reviewed) 

*	Software demonstrations    

*	Simulation workshops 

*	Discussion forums 

*	Info and job fairs 

There will be opportunities for researchers to present and discuss new
methods, vendors to demonstrate their products and deliver workshops, and
architecture and engineering firms to examine new tools and meet future
employees.

For more information on the conference, please visit the conference web site

The AEE, Assoc. of Energy Engineers offers the CEM certification....
Certified Energy Manager.

This certification is of debatable value, in my opinion.  In my work, I
have worked with many who have acquired this certification.  Many
individuals I found barely had competence in efficiency and knew little
of common HVAC systems and applications.

I suppose it is like any certification or professional registration...
there are those who are highly skilled and quite capable, and others
marginally so.

Hello everyone,

While using eQuest (DOE2.2), I have noticed that each time evaporative
precooling is used (indirect, or indirect/direct), the system peak cooling
load increases (from ss-d report).

Can anyboby give me some insight why this is happenning?

Thanks a lot!

Vikram,

I tried to use indirect evaporative cooling only, the peak cooling load
decreases from the (indirect/direct case) but still larger than the base
case (without evap.precooling.)
Also, if change the fraction of the air that's evaporative precooling to be
a smaller value, same as above.
So, the latent load does play a role in the increasing of the peak load but
should not be the only reason.

Hourly report shows :

1. if total system flow rate is autosized, the total system flow is lower in
the evap. precooling case than the normal case. And during the peak day, for
the test building, the evap. precooling allways uses 100% OA, while the
normal case uses the minimum OA.
2. if the total system flow is manually defined. The total peak system flow
is same for both cases. But the evap. precooling still uses 100% OA on the
peak day.

So, I suspect, another reason might be the more amount of OA, or less amount
of total system air?

Anna,
I'm not sure, but it could be that since you are using evap cooling, the
latent loads might be adding to the overall peak cooling loads. What is
the dry bulb high limit that you have set? Does the overall building
energy reduce?

Is anyone aware of or in possession of fan and pump load distribution curves
for variable flow applications as a product of building simulation modeling,
metering, or other?  If so, I would welcome the information or direction to
it.  Obviously much of this would be location and building
configuration-specific.  Anecdotal data for specific sites/locations,
typical representative values, and statistical aggregations of a larger
sample all would be welcome.  Thank you in advance.
