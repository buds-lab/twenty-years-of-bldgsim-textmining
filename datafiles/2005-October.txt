Dear Colleagues,
   Our firm has been asked to write a TRNSYS model of a barrel vault
style greenhouse (metal half hoops with a two sheets of thin plastic
stretched over them, enclosed on both ends but usually heavily
ventilated). Is anybody aware of research that has been done in this
area and whether models have been developed? We are looking more for
models of the fundamental energy transfers and not as much for
approximations that can be made using work-arounds in existing tools.
Any help or direction that could be provided would be greatly
appreciated.
Kind regards,
  David

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200510210752.AA5200265pd80000829014@gard.com>

This is one of the drawbacks of an economizer on a single-fan, dual-duct system. It happens in the free-cooling mode when the mixed air temp is less than the return air temp, and less than the cold deck but more than the preheating coil temp. It can be reduced with a hot deck reset, or heating plant shut-down schedule that is near to this range. You can see what is happening by looking at the hourly outputs. You can also see this with the spreadsheets that were used for ASHRAE RP865.

Subject: [bldg-sim] air-side economizer...increase in heating load???


Greetings,
 
Has anyone out there experienced a situation where DOE-2 predicted an increase in heating energy consumption when using the air-side economizer?  I was using the OA Temperature as the control (set at 65F, and I tried min temp at both 52 and 55, where 55 was also my cold deck supply temp).
 
I saw an expected decrease in cooling energy consumed, but there was an increase in heating and a small increase in fan energy.  I am modeling a building in Appleton, WI.  However, I made a simple base model as well to see if the problem was my original model.  For Appleton, Albuquerque, and Boulder (I only looked at 3), all three locations showed this increase in heating energy and decrease in cooling for the simple building.
 
Does anyone know if the RA damper modulates when the economizer is used, or does it fully close and thus provide 100% OA to the supply duct?
 
Any thoughts would be much appreciated.  THanks in advance.

Regards,

Paul

Hi Paul:

I am willing to bet you are using a multizone type of
HVAC unit. I was told by a wise old engineer, and
verified by DOE2 that heating does indeed go up in
reality for this type of system.

Understand that the economizer for this type of system
throws the cool outsider air where heating and cooling
coils are acting simultaneously, with the damper being
the particular zone modulator.

When you add 100% OSA, zones calling for cooling are
satisfied and little heating is used. But those zones
calling for heating, will find the entire airflow to
that zone now needing heating, not just a hot deck.

Thus, the heating energy goes up.

Guys and gals, check my logic on this one, please..

FYI. 

You can calculate the DOY with the spreadsheet using an @MOD(@DATE(month,day,year),7) function. This yields a repetitive 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,0,1...for each hour. 0 and 1 are Sat and Sun, 1-6 are M-F. This is a modulo function base 7 that operates on the linear date that the DATE function generates. For all spreadsheets day 1 = Jan 1, 1900. You can then do a double sort on the DOY and hour to get your weather by weekday and by working hour.

Gaurav,

you can separate weekends and workdays with the excel method you used
already very simply:
just indroduce a new column in which you give the the workdays the number 1
and the weekdays the number 2. Then you can use the filter function to sort
out the days you need. Once you have created this column for one data file
you can copy it to the other files.

Greetings,

Thanks a lot everyone for your response.

With the help of one of the responses out of the group, I figured out a way 
in excel to separate out occupied and unoccupied hrs weather data from an 
energy plus weather file that I converted to CSV format through energy plus 
weather converter.

I used the menu item data/filter/autofilter to filter out data using the 
custom feature specifying the hours 'greater or equal to' and 'lesser or 
equal to'. Excel displayed the filtered out data which then was copied to 
another work sheet. It is easier to do it for occupied hours as the hours 
are in ascending order, it gets a bit trickier when working out for 
unoccupied hours using this method. I filtered out data separately for hours 
from 01:00 hrs to 07:00 hrs and for 19:00 hrs -24:00 hrs. After copying this 
data onto another work sheet I sorted out using the date (mm/dd/yyyy) column 
of data set. There is one problem here, as excel interprets the mm/dd/yyy as 
numbers and they are not in the same order as the actual month. For this I 
separated out the month and date in different columns and then sorted the 
data to get the desired results.

I know this may not be the most efficient way to do it in excel, but I am 
limited with my knowledge of using excel to its fullest capabilities. 
However, there is a limitation in this method too, as it does not 
differentiate between weekdays and weekends and holidays. I realized it 
later, but I think I'll need to differentiate this for my analysis.



Gerald,

That was the first thing I realized that BinMaker Pro can do what I am 
looking for. However, as a student I can not bear the cost of it. I greatly 
appreciate your offer, but I don't know, it might take a long time as I need 
to analyze 6 locations in the US.

I will need weather data (DB, DP, RH, Wind Speed, Wind Direction, 
Atmospheric Pressure) for both occupied (08:00 hrs - 18:00 hrs) and 
unoccupied hours (19:00 hrs- 07:00) hrs separately with a working week of 5 
days per week (Monday through Friday).

I must thank once again to all the respondents for their inputs.

unoccupied data (19:00hrs-07:00hrs.) from a TMY2 or energy plus weather
file. Is it too time consuming to do it in excel?
 
I know of Binmaker pro, but that costs around $150.00. 
 
 
 
Any input would be greatly appreciated.
 
 
 
Best regards,
 
 
Gaurav Mehta

Gaurav,
Bin maker pro can do that for you. Let me know what
you need and maybe I can quickly do it for you.

I have created a program that does exactly what you asked for.  Check it
out at
http://www.hvacware.net/tmy2bin.html

I ask a reasonable fee ($25) to use it.

It saves bin weather data to your occupancy specifications as a .CSV file,
directly openable by excel.

Shem:

The Oregon Department of Energy used to have some useful methodology
guides for "Whole Building Approach-1995" and "Simplified Tradeoff
Approach-2001" code compliance modeling. These guides had a wide variety
of typical occupancy, lighting, equipment,... etc. schedules. They are
general but possibly a good starting point.

Check their website at http://egov.oregon.gov/ENERGY/

Mark,

Your windows are being cut off because eQuest doesn't allow placement of 
windows in a plenum. To fix your problem, go to wizard screen 3 and set 
your Wall Ext Finish to "Glass, Spandrel".

I am entering windows in the DD wizard through the custom input screen.
When I view the windows in 3D Geometry, the windows get cut off above
the ceiling elevation. Is the window really in the input or does eQUEST
delete any window portion above ceiling plane?

In my case I am modeling a spandrel section which is glass but doesn't
allow any light through. The spandrel starts below the ceiling line of
lower shell and goes up above the second shell floor plane. What's the
best way to model this? Should I have two windows one in lower shell and
one in upper shell?

Hello Gaurav Mehta,

If you want to modify or extract data from a TMY2 file you can use a BIN 
to TXT converter.  Once the TMY2.bin file is converted to a text file 
you can just import into Excel .  You can then convert the modified text 
file back to a bin file if you wish.  You can download all the 
neccessary utlilities at  http://doe2.com/Download/Weather/     
DOE22WeatherUtilities.ZIP.

Does anyone know if you can change or add to the colors shown in the 3-D
building view for walls, floor or windows, etc in eQUEST?  Can
additional building components be added to color legend? For example
could one glass type be shown in default blue and another in a different
color?

Jeff, one can use ASHRAE standard 55 to predict comfort in ballrooms,
simply use the correct metabolic rate and clothing factors and it is
easy to analyze comfort for different HVAC systems. Not having been in
too many Ballrooms but having designed a few I would say this is the
best approach. Now if one were designing a bar that might be a different
approach, which one more akin to adaptive comfort, the more you drink
the more your body adapts to the environment.

So the bottom line for the Ballroom is if you get the system wrong, make
sure they have plenty to drink.

Yes indeed, you are part of Africa !  My apologies 

If you are ever in Johannesburg, please give me a call.

I guess you are working on modeling of buildings in the tropics. Have you
done anything on residential buildings ?

Hello, 

No, you're not the only one of Africa on the BLDG-SIM line. A few of us are
living in Reunion Island (in the indian ocean) and so, even separated but a
few thousand kilometers, we are neighbours. Unfortunuatly, we haven't done
work about ballrooms, but may be our simulation code CODYRUN (something like
QUICKTEMP of E. Matthews of S.A.) could do something for you. Contact us if
you're interessed.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200510141254.AA5459921pd80000820432@gard.com>

Does anyone know why heat recovery is not available for heat pumps?  Is this currently being developed?  We run into this over and over again.  Heat recovery is one of the better and widely used ECMs but it still has major modeling limitations with certain systems.
 
Thanks,
Brad

Randy,
 
I believe the only way to model air to air heat recovery in eQuest is to use the detailed edit mode.  You are also restricted to certain system types as well.  For example you cannot model heat recovery on heat pump systems.
 
The default values for how the heat recovery operates assume very poor operation, I think this was done to force users to go in and select exactly how the system will operate.  I suggest that you look at the documentation for eQuest / DOE2.2 available on the eQuest website.  Specifically DOE22 Vol 2-Dictonary has all the ERV keywords with a brief description.  The ERV keywords start on page 345.
 
Other than that there isn't much documentation on the algorithms they are using.  It would be nice if more information were available on how the calculation works.  I have figured out the following through trial and error.
 
An ERV summary report is created in the SIM file for each system you model with ERV.  The report appears after the SS-N report, however it does not appear in the report drop-down box in the D2Sim-Viewer.  
 
The additional fan energy used by an ERV is reported as Vent-Fan energy while the power associated with the ERV (motor to turn an enthalpy wheel) is reported as auxiliary energy.  In the ERV report these numbers are combined as total ERV electrical use.   
 
If you look at the SV-A report (detailing air-side systems) the extra static or kW/cfm you specify for an ERV does not get reported.  
 
The ERV fan energy shows up in the Monthly summary of the SS-L report but NOT in the annual breakdown at the bottom of the report.  The ERV fan energy is also included in the SS-M report. 
 
I have also had trouble using the hourly reports to calibrate fans with ERV because of how the different calculations interact.  For example the "Supply Fan kW" and "Return Fan kW" variables do not report any of the ERV fan energy use if you select the ERV Fans as "HVAC supply/Return"  
 
It's frustrating to say the least but I have always had good results once I get the ERV calibrated. 
 
Good luck.

Hello bldg-sim readers,

We have been enthusiastically using eQuest 3.55 for energy modeling recently.  However, savings for air-to-air heat recovery predicted seems to always be much lower than expected.  We are comparing savings to a spreadsheet that incorporates a bin method.   The bin method calculates savings that are believable including penalties for additional fan HP, etc.  I have looked in the (hard to use) archives for this list, but can not find anything that helps.  I am curious about the following:

What does it take to model heat recovery using the wizard?

What are the important inputs that effect heat recovery savings?

I have one model that I must use detailed edit mode.  How can I add heat recovery using detailed edit mode?

If you can help me or point me to where these Q's have already been answered, I would be forever grateful.

Standard 55-2004 comfort region.
- Table of contents for HTML output and optional unit
conversion for J into kWh, MJ or GJ.
- Unit conversion utility produces output in user-definable
units (I-P!)

User Interface Update
Several interfaces and utilities for EnergyPlus are now
available.  EP-Quick creates an EnergyPlus input file based
on a broad range of zone templates and was released in
April 2005.  E2AC is an interface in Portuguese and English
available since January 2005 (more languages are planned).
DesignBuilder is also available in a fully-functional beta
version (beta versions have been available since April 2003).
Several other interfaces are under development.  Watch our
web site (www.energyplus.gov/ep_interfaces.html) for up-to-date
information on these and other interfaces.

A number of utilities and tools for creating, editing, and
running input files come with EnergyPlus, including IDF Editor,
EP-Launch, and HVAC-Diagram (see www.energyplus.gov/ep_utilities.html).
Third party tools for creating, editing, and displaying
EnergyPlus input files are also available, including DrawBDL,
EcoTect, Green Building Studio, EzDrawPlus, IFCtoIDF, TSe+, and
EzPlus-Parm.  See www.energyplus.gov/third_party_tools.html for
more information.

EnergyPlus Weather Data
Weather data for 975 locations worldwide are available on the
EnergyPlus web site:       www.energyplus.gov/weatherdata.html.
If you know of or have other weather data that you'd be willing
to share with the EnergyPlus user community, please contact Dru
Crawley (Drury.Crawley at ee.doe.gov).

How Does EnergyPlus Compare with Other Simulation Programs?
A new report is now available contrasting the features and
capabilities of twenty building energy simulation programs:
BLAST, BSim, DeST, DOE-2.1E, ECOTECT, Ener-Win, Energy Express,
Energy-10, EnergyPlus, eQUEST, ESP-r, IDA ICE, IES <VE>,
HAP, HEED, PowerDomus, SUNREL, Tas, TRACE and TRNSYS. This
comparison is based on information provided by program
developers and users in the following categories: general
modeling features; zone loads; building envelope, daylighting
and solar; infiltration, ventilation and multizone airflow;
renewable energy systems; electrical systems and equipment;
HVAC systems; HVAC equipment; environmental emissions; economic
evaluation; climate data availability; results reporting;
validation; and user interfaces, links to other programs, and
availability. The almost 60-page report, jointly published in
July 2005 by the U. S. Department of Energy, University of
Strathclyde, and University of Wisconsin-Madison, is available
for download (585 KB) from:
http://www.energytoolsdirectory.gov/pdfs/contrasting_the_capabilities_of_bui

lding_energy_performance_simulation_programs_v1.0.pdf

[Or if you haven't been to the Tools Directory recently--check
out the information on 300 tools from more than 20 countries
(www.energytoolsdirectory.gov) and look for the Comparison
report under Additional Resources on the lower right side.]


Thanks!

Subject: [bldg-sim] water-side economizer in eQUEST
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200510131405.AA052031pd80000819121@gard.com>

Hi all,

 

I am trying to model a water side economizer in eQUEST. It will not let
me do it unless I have a water cooled chiller. My chiller condenser is
air-cooled and I want to be able to use a water side economizer on it. 

My question is - Is there a way to trick the system to model such a
situation? Can I use some kind of heat exchanger or heat rejection
equipment on my chilled water loop? I tried changing the chiller to a
watercooled condenser type and then use a water side economizer on it,
but I get this added pump/fan energy (which is resulting in overall
higher energy use) and not serving my purpose. I am quite sure energy
use should go down but that's not happening.

 

I am running this model in Mumbai, India and Quito, Ecuador. Both places
should be able to economize on cooling energy using free cooling.

 

Thanks

Alpana

Yes, awk is an excellent tool for pattern matching and extraction. 

For complex translation/transformation (example generating HTML from text
formats etc), one may want to consider specialized tools developed for
this purpose. Here is such a tool from Sankhya Technologies:

I've used awk for years to extract data from DOE-2 files, and have a whole 
library of awk scripts for different reports. The following  sample awk 
script gets the numbers from BEPS, but all my awk scripts are similar. 
Basically, I'm just having awk reproduce what a person would have to do, 
i.e., find the beginning of the report by searching for the unique string 
(BEPS, SS-A,  SS-F), and then either start count lines, or search for label 
identifiers, as in the BEPS example, and record the variables of interest. 
Then, at the end of the table, stop further reading.. The scripts are so 
simple that often I don't even save them, but write new one as fits the 
need.

{if ($2 ~/BEPS/)
    {
    ipr = 1
    printf("\n%7s\n\n",substr(prevline,46,7))
    }
}
{if (ipr == 1)

I've developed Excel based VBA macros to setup, run and post process batch mode DOE-2.2 simulations.  Once you get the hang of the key VBA functions it is quite powerful.  In terms of extracting information specific to a system, zone, or piece of plant equipment I have had these in Excel cells that are then assigned to VBA variables as part of the macro to enable searching for system/zone/equipment information by report type.  You could probably write a macro to extract all zone names from the SV-A reports, but I haven't gone this far.  While SIM files are highly predictable there are situations where their format varies and thus you need to be careful with line counting from a report header etc.  Simple things like dual duct systems have two lines per zone in the SV-A report.  There are other reports that vary in structure vertically but I can't think of them off the top of my head.  Microsoft.com has a lot of excellent knowledge base information for solving those VBA problems that aren't immediately obvious.

Graham

  Paul, you can add this line below to your eQuest.ini file (if it's not there already?) to get a listing of the equipment and AHU parameters.

            StoreResults_HVAC_Summary=1

  This will create a CSV file with the information in it.

  No help with the extraction of the other reports.  I used a simple approach where I used a macro to format the *.sim so that it's easier to read (select all, change font size smaller, and landscape pages)...but no extraction.

  If anyone has some good VBA I'd be interested in seeing it, if it's public.

  Lastly, I don't know if everyone knew this or not...but you can copy and paste items out of the "spreadsheet view".

enhancements, some of which are listed below. For a more complete list,
go to the web site and look at the CONTAM 2.4 Software page and note the
highlighted sections of the 2.4 Manual also available on the website.

Please use new feedback link available at the top of each page of the web site to provide us with 
comments, suggestions and reports of "unplanned features".

New Features of CONTAM 2.4

Note: CONTAM 2.4 is backwards compatible with earlier versions
meaning you can open existing projects created with previous versions
(but once saved in 2.4 format can not be opened with the previous
version.) The utility PrjUp24.exe is provided that you can use to quickly
convert earlier versions to the current version. Be sure to use it on
copies of your existing PRJ files.

Increased number of building components from 32,767 to 2,147,483,647.

Short time-step method: A new simulation mode that solves
contaminant dispersal equations using an explicit solution method. This
enables the simulation of one-dimensional convection/diffusion within
user-selected zones and the duct system as a whole.

New simulation modes: Automated duct balancing, building
pressurization test and building airflow verification test

New filter models: Particle, Gaseous and Super filter elements

New Deposition sink models

Control super elements

TCP/IP socket simulation control

Usability enhancements
o Find-and-replace:  search for and replace properties of building components

o Enhanced SketchPad navigation using Ctrl and Shift plus Arrow Keys and Mouse wheel

o; Keyboard icon placement: use keyboard to place icons on the SketchPad

o Floating status bar

o User-defined zone colors

o User-defined duct colors and automated duct tracing/coloring tool

o Generate bitmap file (.bmp) of SketchPad

There is also a Summary report within eQuest that you can view in the Air-Side HVAC view.  The report has each system, zones served by each system and the design parameters you describe (CFM, OA CFM, hours out of range etc).  Just select the summary tab next to the spreadsheet tab.

Paul, you can add this line below to your eQuest.ini file (if it's not there already?) to get a listing of the equipment and AHU parameters.

          StoreResults_HVAC_Summary=1

This will create a CSV file with the information in it.

No help with the extraction of the other reports.  I used a simple approach where I used a macro to format the *.sim so that it's easier to read (select all, change font size smaller, and landscape pages)...but no extraction.

If anyone has some good VBA I'd be interested in seeing it, if it's public.

Lastly, I don't know if everyone knew this or not...but you can copy and paste items out of the "spreadsheet view".

David

Paul,
I don't know if you are referring to something beyond the SIM file
generated by eQUEST, but is not, you will probably find that this
contains all the data that you are looking for.
 
Its a text file containing all the reports from the simulation. The BEPU
& BEPS reports contain information about hours spent outside the
throttling range (information that is actually available in your summary
window in eQUEST itself (under air side HVAC). On the eQUEST website
you can find an example DOE2 output file that will point you to where to
find each of the reports in the document
(http://doe2.com/download/eQUEST/DOE22Reports-and-QC_2001-06-07.zip). 
 
Hope this helps

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200510071328.AA2818203pd80000812662@gard.com>

Has anyone ever used eQUEST to model a radiant cooling and heating system.  I know this would definately not be the right tool to use for sizing and for a detailed analysis for a radiant system, however would it be completely inaccurate for an Annual energy analysis.  I am considering using a fan coil or VAV system for this purpose.  For heating i could use the baseboard and also assume that the setpoint for this purpose could be setback by 2degF so as to take advantage for the radiant effect.   if using VAV the ratio would be set at 100%. 
I would appreciate it if anyone who has tried to do this can share their experience with me.

Thankyou
Amarpreet

Subject: [bldg-sim] Building Pre-Heating Question

Does anyone have experimental or simulation case study experience on using
a building's inherent thermal mass for energy storage?

Specifically, we have a client that manages a conventionally-constructed
17-story 30-year old office building and a conventional chiller/boiler/VAV
system.  In the winter, they are considering setting the temperature
setpoint very high for a few hours before occupancy to heat up the concrete
& furnishings, then coasting later in the day.  The system would have
sensors placed deep in the concrete to monitor temperature and help optimize
the controls.

The approach might use more energy (lower system temperature differences,
higher average inside temperature), or it might use less (running systems at
full load, lower average inside temperature because of radiant comfort).
The manager's primary goal is to increase tenant comfort.

In the summer they could do the reverse.  The building is located in the
Pacific Northwest U.S.  Any results would be welcome, but a case study from
a similar climate would be ideal.

Thank you in advance.

Jon,
That would be great.  Apparently the core of the building is drilled (on
the floors mentioned) with inserted sensors tied to HVAC systems which
determine mass temperature to assist in preventing the core of the
building from dropping below specific set points.  I gather that when
operating correctly this would trim warm up times & keep the building
heat/cooling systems running more efficiently.

Hi I am looking technical examples or resources for, "building mass

temperature control." I have a large commercial project wanting to core
drill into the building foundation on the 6th and 13th floor of a 17
story
high rise. The building was built in the early 70's. Using this mass
thermal
temperature the building owner would like to try to reduce temperature
swings, resulting in improved tenant comfort and reduced energy usage.



Has Aspen had any experience with this approach?  Any assistance you

Thanks everyone for all the helps/ suggestions and tips. It was indeed
great to get so many responses....

 

The mystery is finally solved :-)

Yes, I compared each and every number on the input files....and found
where I had goofed!

It was mostly the schedule and internal load :)

 

Thanks again

A handy tool in situations like this where you want to sync up different
files is "Compare-It" -- it will let you compare two text files side by
side.

 

This won't work if the naming structure is different for the three
buildings, but if they are named similarly it will highlight differences
in the inputs.

 

You still have all the editing functionality of notepad while using it,
but then you can also copy lines or blocks of lines from one file to the
other.

 

Here is the webpage:   http://www.grigsoft.com/  I can't remember now,
Jason or Mike at Gard had first pointed out this program.  It probably
deserves to be reintroduced to the mailing list periodically!

	Hi, 

	 

	I am being faced with a very interesting problem in eQUEST. And
I just can't find a way to explain it. Maybe someone can help?

	 

	I am modeling 3 generic building sizes - small (4300sqM) medium
(7400sqM) large (11300sqM) in three different climates - Hot, cold and
temperate.

	 

	Typically one would expect energy use on a per sq ft basis to go
down as the building goes up in size.

	In this case the annual energy use per sq ft is the highest in
the medium size building, it's the lowest in the large building and is
slightly higher than the large in the small building.

	 

	For instance in the cold climate it is - 

	Small - 70.7 kBtu/SqFt/Yr

	Medium - 85.8 kBtu/Sqft/yr

	Large - 68.2 kBtu/sqft/yr

	 

	All parameters in all the three buildings are same, and the
buildings are similar in design. The medium size building adds a storey
to convert to a large building and drops a storey to convert to a small
building. Then entire design is very generic.

	 

	Does anyone have any suggestions as to why this could be
happening?

	 

	Also when I look at the BEPS report - I notice that in absolute
terms, the space cooling energy is higher in the medium building than
the large, which is really not possible! 

	 

	Can anyone help?

	 

	Regards

	Alpana

Jon,

I have looked into that issue and found a bunch of good 
references mostly focused on cooling.  Hope this helps.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200510061053.AA5343406pd80000810931@gard.com>

Does anyone have experimental or simulation case study experience on using
a building's inherent thermal mass for energy storage?

Specifically, we have a client that manages a conventionally-constructed
17-story 30-year old office building and a conventional chiller/boiler/VAV
system.  In the winter, they are considering setting the temperature
setpoint very high for a few hours before occupancy to heat up the concrete
& furnishings, then coasting later in the day.  The system would have
sensors placed deep in the concrete to monitor temperature and help optimize
the controls.

The approach might use more energy (lower system temperature differences,
higher average inside temperature), or it might use less (running systems at
full load, lower average inside temperature because of radiant comfort).
The manager's primary goal is to increase tenant comfort.

In the summer they could do the reverse.  The building is located in the
Pacific Northwest U.S.  Any results would be welcome, but a case study from
a similar climate would be ideal.

Thank you in advance.

Jon,
That would be great.  Apparently the core of the building is drilled (on
the floors mentioned) with inserted sensors tied to HVAC systems which
determine mass temperature to assist in preventing the core of the
building from dropping below specific set points.  I gather that when
operating correctly this would trim warm up times & keep the building
heat/cooling systems running more efficiently.

I have no knowledge of that at all.  I could post a query to a building
simulation site user group I am a member of if you would like.  If so
though, what do you mean by drilling into the foundation on the 6th &
13th

Hi I am looking technical examples or resources for, "building mass
thermal
temperature control." I have a large commercial project wanting to core
drill into the building foundation on the 6th and 13th floor of a 17
story
high rise. The building was built in the early 70's. Using this mass
thermal
temperature the building owner would like to try to reduce temperature
swings, resulting in improved tenant comfort and reduced energy usage.



Has Aspen had any experience with this approach?  Any assistance you
could
provide would be greatly appreciated.

A handy tool in situations like this where you want to sync up different
files is "Compare-It" -- it will let you compare two text files side by
side.
 
This won't work if the naming structure is different for the three
buildings, but if they are named similarly it will highlight differences
in the inputs.
 
You still have all the editing functionality of notepad while using it,
but then you can also copy lines or blocks of lines from one file to the

Alpana,

I just finished modeling 4 temporary-trailer type buildings, all in the 
same project. Each trailer had an identical setup in the wizard, the 
only difference was their orientation on the land. When I clicked 
finish, I went into the zone-level lighting spreadsheet. The Watts Per 
Square Foot values for the buildings were: 1.42, 1.42, 1.42, 1.33.

Four identical buildings, yet eQuest created different default lighting 
values. This tells me that eQuest took into account the orientation of 
the trailer in generating these values (3 bldgs were oriented North, 1 
bldg was oriented East).

To draw from this... My guess is that although you entered similar 
parameters for each building, eQuest has generated default assumptions 
that are causing the descrepency.

Hello Alpana:

Obviously, we don't know the whole story unless you
email us your .pd2 and .inp files. But I am willing to
bet the inter load characteristics and schedules may
be different. Also, I believe eQuest chooses an
appropriate HVAC system, which may not be consistant
from building to building.

Something may not be consistant with input.

I would love to here what you finally find.

Hi, 

 

I am being faced with a very interesting problem in eQUEST. And I just
can't find a way to explain it. Maybe someone can help?

 

I am modeling 3 generic building sizes - small (4300sqM) medium
(7400sqM) large (11300sqM) in three different climates - Hot, cold and
temperate.

 

Typically one would expect energy use on a per sq ft basis to go down as
the building goes up in size.

In this case the annual energy use per sq ft is the highest in the
medium size building, it's the lowest in the large building and is
slightly higher than the large in the small building.

 

For instance in the cold climate it is - 

Small - 70.7 kBtu/SqFt/Yr

Medium - 85.8 kBtu/Sqft/yr

Large - 68.2 kBtu/sqft/yr

 

All parameters in all the three buildings are same, and the buildings
are similar in design. The medium size building adds a storey to convert
to a large building and drops a storey to convert to a small building.
Then entire design is very generic.

 

Does anyone have any suggestions as to why this could be happening?

 

Also when I look at the BEPS report - I notice that in absolute terms,
the space cooling energy is higher in the medium building than the
large, which is really not possible! 

 

Can anyone help?

Alpana

As a follow up I wanted to thank everyone who replied.

 

GFX and PowerPipe both offer a range of heat recovery units that can tie in
directly to single showers or to drain risers of varying sizes.  The web
sites can be found with a search.  I understand there may be some industry
dispute going on in this product area about distribution and technology to
be aware of. 

 

No one had a source of data on drain line temperatures, particularly for
mixed flow, that is not just showers.  I would still like this, since at
times, separating out showers on separate stacks costs extra, and if the
mixed drain temperatures are significantly above the domestic water supply
temperatures, reasonable heat recovery may be possible there. 

 

For my project, we are going to have dedicated shower drain stacks, which
are combined on multiple floors, to 6 stacks, at 3" diameter and heat
recovery units are available for this.  I am still determining how this will
work out in connecting to our two central domestic water heater locations,
and the paybacks. 

 

Thanks,

 

Brian Thornton

line temperatures from multi-family buildings?

 

I am looking for information on the temperatures of the waste water leaving
multi-family buildings.

 

We have looked at drain heat recovery at individual showers and units, and
found the space requirements (and placement of heat recovery equipment in
some other tenant/owner spaces) to be too big an obstacle.

 

I am wondering if there is enough heat to consider central heat recovery off
of the combined drain lines to pre-heat domestic hot water make-up.

 

Any one have history in trying such a heat recovery approach?

The workshop is limited to 30 students

 

Attendees should bring their own laptop

 

During the lecture session, the presenters will walk the audience through modern and revolutionary new building envelope design concepts, with emphasis on the hot-humid climate. The audience will be exposed to the conditions and remedies of moisture that have had devastating effects on modern construction. New techniques will be shown, and the audience will be introduced to new material application to eliminate moisture-related problems in buildings, such as mold and decay. Design criteria for indoor environments, thermal performance, cool surfaces (roofs + walls) and issues related to balancing building envelope cycles (wetting, storage, drying) will be discussed. 

 

Each student must bring a laptop computer. The student will be provided with a complete copy of the program and a licensing agreement to use this powerful modeling program. Each student will be walked through every aspect of the modeling sequencing, allowing them to understand and create wall designs that would be most appropriate for the geographical location, elevations and locations of the walls. The workshop will provide: 

* Basic building envelope design principles

* Heat and mass transfer fundamentals 

* Validation of modern hygrothermal simulation tools 

* Necessary input data: where can I get them and what accuracy is required? 

* The Do's and Don'ts of WUFI-ORNL 

* What do the results tell me - performance predicting 

* Model growth predictions - new post-processing modules

* Development and future extensions of WUFI-ORNL, future standards and guideline

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200510030816.AA1640671pd80000806323@gard.com>

I'm also very glad to know  more comparison between eQUEST predicted and actual energy performance for GSHP
systems. According to a previous comparison study and my experience, the GLHE (vertical) model implemented in DOE 2.2 (and DOE 2.1 E) significantly over-predict the swing of loop temperature, which could in turn result in the under-prediction of the savings from GSHP systems.
 
In addition, the ground thermal properties and undisturbed ground temperature (which could be a few degrees higher than the soil temperature because of the vertical ground thermal heat flux) play an important role in the GSHP performance. The errors in these parameters may also be responsible for the under-prediction.
 
Another thing needs to be mentioned is that current eQUEST doesn't account for the effect of grouting, which could change the loop temperature significantly.
 
Last but not the least, the eQUEST default COP and EER of the GSHP are far below those of the currently available GSHP units. Higher COP and EER will make a big difference in the predicted energy savings.
 
This is my experience of using eQUEST for GSHP simulation. Hope it helps. I am looking forward to other peoples opinion and experience.
 
Have a nice week,
 
Xiaobing

Yes, you can model ground source heat pump systems (GSHP). How accurate the
results are I'm not sure. You have to create a Loop in water side and then
add a Ground Loop Heat Exchanger. Check the min and max alarm temperatures
since sometimes these need to be adjusted.

I did model a small 10,000 sf building a few years ago in eQuest with GSHP
and compared it to actual data. Predicted was 43 kBtu/sf/yr and actual was
25 kBtu/sf/yr (a 99 Energy Star rating!) My life cycle cost results showed
the indirect/direct evaporative cooling was better than GSHP (since the
building was in a dry climate of Colorado), however the owner wanted to go
with the GSHP system. The owner is very energy conscious so they do turn off
equipment at around 3 PM for this school maintenance building which might be
part of the low energy usage, however, I wonder if eQuest under-predicts the
savings from GSHP systems?

GSHPs are all the rage, but I don't think they are cost-effective if you
have natural gas for heating as your base case. But then again, with the
rising cost of natural gas, maybe they will be more affordable. Anyone else
have any experience with predicted versus actual energy performance for GSHP
systems?

In an increasingly deregulated utility market, utilities increasingly
want predictable (evened-out) consumption patterns and are encouraging
their customers to shave-off peak demand (by having high on-peak
charges or giving financial incentives)-- It may be worthwhile looking
for a best rate structure available for your design/client and modeling
that than a flat rate.

Scott,
 
I think you should be using the actual electric utility rate and calculating electric consumption and electric demand costs because that's what the owner is going to be paying.  You should also be incuding taxes, monthly fees and any additional riders or tariffs that might apply.  It would be pretty tough to justify a blended kWh cost for a new construction project because in order to be relevant it would need to be based on the actual operation of the building.
 
Furthermore with regard to whether using the actual rate will hurt your modeling results....the goal of LEED is not to "win as many points as you can" but rather to promote efficient, sustainable buildings. The goal of using energy modeling should be to improve the overall building design.  If you don't like the results of the energy model make design changes untill you do.  
 
For example if your client has a demand ratchet and your building design creates a large summer cooling peak, the client will be paying for that all year long.  If you used a blended rate you won't see the effects of that in the utility cost.  
 
I hope this helps.

I am a new user of eQUEST and am trying to model a building for LEED energy savings purposes. I am comparing my design building to the ASHRAE 90.1 Code requirements of the same building. 

 

When setting up my electricity rates I can use Block Charges and Ratchets. If I was able to find an average rate per kWh, how much would this impact my energy reports? I am concerned that trying to get too complicated by using multiple types of rates could actually hurt my model more than help it.

 

Any thoughts would be appreciated

Let's think about the over-all process.  This 
model will be used to certify that a given 
expenditure by a building owner is eligible for 
tax credits which in turn will be used to 
determine his overall tax liability.  How 
accurate or precise is this tax liability?    In 
my experience, it is a huge squishy gray area 
determined by how clever or aggressive the person 
preparing the tax return is and also how the IRS 
interprets these efforts.  I don't believe we 
need to do a research level analysis to determine 
one component in a very imprecise process.  I 
think this is more of a horseshoes and hand 
grenades situation.  Of course, the analysis 
needs to include enough detail and enough care to 
support the intention of the law enabling the tax 
credit.  So there needs to be a careful selection 
of the tools which can be used, and a process 
which will screen the analysts to determine a 
basic competency level and perhaps more 
importantly to help assure that they are 
reputable and not colluding with the tax payer to 
cheat the government.  Other than that, I suggest 
that we try to keep the process simple and 
economical with simple tools and a large stable of readily-available analysts.

Based on AEC's VisualDOE training experience, I believe a certification
process based on an extensive three to five days training on energy
modeling for EIT, PE etc would make more sense than an exam. Background
knowledge of engineering and architecture, familiar with modeling tools,
and a dedicated quality control process are crucial in getting
meaningful results from energy modeling.

My two cents
..

 

It would be easiest to stick with the typical protocol for the building
design industry
.. where engineers and architects need a licensed
engineer or architect to stamp the drawings and specs, so should it be
with energy modeling. Who actually does the design in engineering and
architectural firms is often not the licensed engineer or architect. But
that licensed person does do a thorough review of the drawings and
specifications, just as a licensed mechanical, electrical, or
architectural engineer or licensed architect might review an energy
model and report.

 

Other than requiring that, the Certified Energy Manager exam given by
the Association of Energy Engineers is a good alternative. It is a
comprehensive 3 to 6 hour test, I can?t remember, on energy efficiencies
issues and requires a good understanding of energy usage in buildings.

 

The LEED test would not be good to require as it is not comprehensive
enough and goes into very little detail on energy issues.

 

Why create something new when there are already existing procedures in
the building design industry?

Our modeling group discussed this on Friday.  We agree that many of the
most experienced modelers are not registered professionals.  Most
projects, via building codes, require the oversight of a registered
professional any way. We don't think defaulting to a registered
professional will give assurance that the model is a reasonable
representation of a project, unless that person actually created the
model.  There are simply too many details in a typical energy model that
may be overlooked if the registered individual did not create it.  So,
if a certification process is going to be required, it should be at the
individual level.  If DOE doesn't create a process to certify modelers,
such as a training workshop plus exam plus standard practices, then
perhaps a professional organization would take the lead.  ASHRAE, IBPSA,
AIA, or AEE might be candidates.

Dear Building Energy Analysis Colleagues:

 

I am writing to you on behalf of the commercial subcommittee of the Tax
Incentives Assistance Project (TIAP.)  TIAP is a coalition of public,
private and NGO parties with a strong interest in effective
implementation of the energy efficiency tax incentives included in the
Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005, also known as the ?energy bill?.)

 

The commercial tax incentives require the use of ?certified? computer
software that is run by ?qualified individuals.?  The Department of
Energy is in the process of making recommendations to the Treasury
Department on how these individuals should be certified.  A good fact
sheet on the commercial building tax incentives can be found at
www.nema.org <http://www.nema.org/> .

 

An excerpt from EPAct 2005 addressing this certification is shown below.

 

`(6) CERTIFICATION-

`(A) IN GENERAL- The Secretary shall prescribe the manner and method for
the making of certifications under this section.

`(B) PROCEDURES- The Secretary shall include as part of the
certification process procedures for inspection and testing by qualified
individuals described in subparagraph (C) to ensure compliance of
buildings with energy-savings plans and targets. Such procedures shall
be comparable, given the difference between commercial and residential
buildings, to the requirements in the Mortgage Industry National
Accreditation Procedures for Home Energy Rating Systems.

`(C) QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS- Individuals qualified to determine
compliance shall be only those individuals who are recognized by an
organization certified by the Secretary for such purposes.

 

In recent discussions we found that DOE views this as an issue and is
looking for some creative ideas on certification of energy analysts for
the purposes of tax incentive rule compliance.  The default outcome may
be to require a licensed design professional (i.e. PE, AIA) as a
qualified individual; however, many of the best modelers and analysts
may not be registered engineers or architects.  Also, unlike the
residential sector, there is no commercial equivalent to RESNET.  As far
as we know there is no certifying body for commercial building energy
analysts or modelers.

 

TIAP is most interested in maximizing participation in the commercial
tax incentives program in order to achieve significant energy savings.
We would like to see a certification approach that allows the greatest
number of qualified energy modelers and energy analysts to carry out
this work.  We are looking for workable solutions to certification that
do not exclude qualified modelers from this market.

 

So, what advice can the community of modelers and energy analysts
provide on this topic?  TIAP and the Alliance to Save Energy are looking
for input on the following questions:

 

*	Are there any existing energy analysis certification programs
that can be used as a model? 

*	Is there any existing organization that could be designated for
certifying energy modelers? 

*	Are there any training courses in modeling and energy analysis
that should be required? 

*	What level of experience should be required for an individual to
be deemed capable for this work? 

*	How should this experience be documented?  Are satisfactory
client references for modeling projects acceptable? 

*	Which of the following designations indicate that an individual
is qualified for energy modeling: 


*	Licensed design professional (i.e. PE, AIA)? 

*	Certified Energy Manager (CEM) from the AEE? 

*	LEED-AP certification from the USGBC 

*	Other? 

*	No existing designation works for this purpose? 

*	Is it practical to require no certification for energy analysts
and just have the licensed building designer sign off on the analysis
results? 

 

TIAP would greatly appreciate your ideas and opinions as soon as
possible, but it would be great to have them by Monday.  Please post
replies to the list.  There are some meetings in Washington DC next week
where this issue will be discussed.

 

Thank you for your consideration of these questions.

I would suggest two approaches recognizing the following - not all "energy
efficiency analysts" are good modelers (and some modelers are better
efficiency experts than the " certified experts").  I believe that if the
analysis is done under the supervision/sign-off of a certified individual
("PE, AIA") that this does not exclude non-certified modelers from doing the
work as is the case with other aspects of the design process.  An
alternative is to have a qualified team review and sign-off as is done with
LEED submittals .

Subject: [bldg-sim] Action Alert!  How should "qualified energy analysts"
 be certified for the new Federal commercial tax incentives?

Our modeling group discussed this on Friday.  We agree that many of the 
most experienced modelers are not registered professionals.  Most 
projects, via building codes, require the oversight of a registered 
professional any way. We don't think defaulting to a registered 
professional will give assurance that the model is a reasonable 
representation of a project, unless that person actually created the 
model.  There are simply too many details in a typical energy model that 
may be overlooked if the registered individual did not create it.  So, 
if a certification process is going to be required, it should be at the 
individual level.  If DOE doesn't create a process to certify modelers, 
such as a training workshop plus exam plus standard practices, then 
perhaps a professional organization would take the lead.  ASHRAE, IBPSA, 
AIA, or AEE might be candidates.

Subject: [bldg-sim] Ground temperatures
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200510310846.AA4652484pd80000842136@gard.com>

Hi,

I am Trying the replicate the ground temperatures calculated by DOE2. This calculation is briefly stated in the Second last paragraph on page 154 of the DOE Topics manual. It is stated that ground temperatures are average outside air temperatures damped and delayed by three months. I am wondering about two aspects.
1) How many days average is the average temperature.
2) How are the temperatures damped.
       
     I could not find these details in the DOE2 manual. Could anyone please let me know how the ground temperatures are calculated or provide any reference to it.
     I am aware of the Kasuda model for calculating the ground temperatures but it has a draw back that we need to know some parameters in order to use it.

Any help appreciated.
Thank you,

Krishna

Subject: [bldg-sim] Modelling an automatic radiation responsive exterior pull down shade


 
Hello everyone:
I am now encountered a problem in modeling an automatic pull down exterior shades of a window, and am seeking your help. The radiation responsive exterior shade will be triggered when the radiation arrives on the exterior surface of the window pane exceeds a certain amount (say 30btu/ft2hr). Since there is a relatively good insulation properties of the exterior shade (say U-value= 1.1 W/m2h), I would like to let DOE2 to take the insulation effect of the shades when it is deployed into consideration. Do you have any suggestions on how to model this?

Any slight comments will be highly appreciated! 

 

best regards

I am not aware of any existing certification systems that would be useful in
the near term on the nonresidential side (though I'm eager to hear if others
think differently). My vote:

 

1. Develop detailed guidelines for modeling protocols.

2. Require certification of calculations by a licensed professional (they
can always hire an expert who is not licensed to do the work for them). 

3. Establish a review/spot check process.

Subject: [bldg-sim] Action Alert! How should "qualified energy analysts" be
certified for the new Federal commercial tax incentives?

 

Dear Building Energy Analysis Colleagues:

 

I am writing to you on behalf of the commercial subcommittee of the Tax
Incentives Assistance Project (TIAP.)  TIAP is a coalition of public,
private and NGO parties with a strong interest in effective implementation
of the energy efficiency tax incentives included in the Energy Policy Act of
2005 (EPAct 2005, also known as the "energy bill".)

 

The commercial tax incentives require the use of "certified" computer
software that is run by "qualified individuals."  The Department of Energy
is in the process of making recommendations to the Treasury Department on
how these individuals should be certified.  A good fact sheet on the
commercial building tax incentives can be found at www.nema.org
<http://www.nema.org/> .

 

An excerpt from EPAct 2005 addressing this certification is shown below.

 

`(6) CERTIFICATION-

`(A) IN GENERAL- The Secretary shall prescribe the manner and method for the
making of certifications under this section.

`(B) PROCEDURES- The Secretary shall include as part of the certification
process procedures for inspection and testing by qualified individuals
described in subparagraph (C) to ensure compliance of buildings with
energy-savings plans and targets. Such procedures shall be comparable, given
the difference between commercial and residential buildings, to the
requirements in the Mortgage Industry National Accreditation Procedures for
Home Energy Rating Systems.

`(C) QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS- Individuals qualified to determine compliance
shall be only those individuals who are recognized by an organization
certified by the Secretary for such purposes.

 

In recent discussions we found that DOE views this as an issue and is
looking for some creative ideas on certification of energy analysts for the
purposes of tax incentive rule compliance.  The default outcome may be to
require a licensed design professional (i.e. PE, AIA) as a qualified
individual; however, many of the best modelers and analysts may not be
registered engineers or architects.  Also, unlike the residential sector,
there is no commercial equivalent to RESNET.  As far as we know there is no
certifying body for commercial building energy analysts or modelers.

 

TIAP is most interested in maximizing participation in the commercial tax
incentives program in order to achieve significant energy savings.  We would
like to see a certification approach that allows the greatest number of
qualified energy modelers and energy analysts to carry out this work.  We
are looking for workable solutions to certification that do not exclude
qualified modelers from this market.

 

So, what advice can the community of modelers and energy analysts provide on
this topic?  TIAP and the Alliance to Save Energy are looking for input on
the following questions:

 

*	Are there any existing energy analysis certification programs that
can be used as a model?
*	Is there any existing organization that could be designated for
certifying energy modelers?
*	Are there any training courses in modeling and energy analysis that
should be required?
*	What level of experience should be required for an individual to be
deemed capable for this work?
*	How should this experience be documented?  Are satisfactory client
references for modeling projects acceptable?
*	Which of the following designations indicate that an individual is
qualified for energy modeling:

*	Licensed design professional (i.e. PE, AIA)?
*	Certified Energy Manager (CEM) from the AEE?
*	LEED-AP certification from the USGBC
*	Other?
*	No existing designation works for this purpose?

*	Is it practical to require no certification for energy analysts and
just have the licensed building designer sign off on the analysis results?

 

TIAP would greatly appreciate your ideas and opinions as soon as possible,
but it would be great to have them by Monday.  Please post replies to the
list.  There are some meetings in Washington DC next week where this issue
will be discussed.

 

Thank you for your consideration of these questions.

Another issue I have come up against in sizing the radiant heaters is the 
recovery time due to large overhead doors opening and closing 
frequently.  The air wash across the floor tends to keep the floor from 
warming up reducing the mean radiant temperature at the human level.

Steve makes a very incisive point.

Where comfort is largely due to radiant heat a very unstable situation can
result.

One only has to spend a day at the beach and observe the reaction of
holiday-makers when the sun disappears behind a cloud to vindicate this.

The time constant for radiant heat is desperately short compared to that of
the ambient temperature as determined by a thermostat. The resultant
oscillation in radiant heat provision could prove to be at no point
comfortable.

Please excuse the cross-postings...


SimBuild 2006

IBPSA-USA will hold its second national conference, August 2-4, 2006 on the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  The format will be similar to the successful SimBuild 2004 held at the University of Colorado, Boulder.  Technical sessions over two days will feature presentations on a wide range of topics related to the simulation of HVAC equipment, airflow in buildings, energy usage, and the visual and acoustic environment in buildings, as well as demonstrations of simulation software and of hardware and software needed to emulate or measure the performance of buildings.   Friday will be a practitioner day, offering case studies, hands-on software demonstrations and other presentations aimed at giving practicing architects and engineers the information they need to be more informed collaborators with simulation experts.  The practitioner day will be coordinated with local US Green Building Council chapters and affiliates.  Training workshops by various software vendors are being scheduled for the Monday and Tuesday preceding the conference - further details will be announced later. 

The conference registration fees are as follows:

Three-day registration (full conference)	$380
Student registration				$180		
One-day registration for practitioner day	$180

Conference housing will be offered on campus in dormitories and in nearby hotels.  Single- and double-occupancy dormitory rooms will range in price from about $65 to $110 per night.

The meeting is open to all, world-wide.  Boston is a convenient destination for travelers from major cities in the U.S. and in many other countries.  It is a historic and compact city, easily explored on foot and via public transportation.  Conference participants may want to stay longer and explore New England's mountains and Atlantic coast, from Maine to Connecticut.  MIT has a growing number of architecturally significant buildings that participants can visit, including recent work by Frank Gehry, Steven Holl, and Kevin Roche, and earlier projects by I.M. Pei, Eero Saarinen, and Finnish master Alvar Aalto.   Harvard University and Harvard Square are a short distance away.

Abstracts will be due by January 31, 2006, on topics concerning component- or system-level simulation at any time in a building's life: design, commissioning, and operation.  Papers may focus on development or application of simulation algorithms and software and case studies are particularly welcome.  More information and instructions for submitting abstracts will be posted soon on the IBPSA-USA web site (www.ibpsa.us).  

Key dates:

January 31	abstracts due (firm deadline)
February 15	abstract acceptance
March 31	papers due
April 30	paper reviews provided to authors
May 31	revised papers due
June 15	final decisions on all papers
August 2-4	SimBuild 2006 conference

Keith,

Under window properties, there is a tab called: "Blinds - Slats - 
Drapes". Here is what eQuest says:

If the heat gain transmitted through the window from direct solar 
radiation (with the shades and blinds not covering the glazing) exceeds 
the Maximum Solar Schedule threshold value, the shading device covers 
the window (and DOE-2 uses the Shading Schedule to calculate the solar 
transmittance of the window and shade). Both the Shading Schedule and 
the Conductance Schedule will only be used when the direct solar gain is 
greater than the Maximum Solar Schedule threshold value.

Specify a "Maximum Solar Schedule", then specify a corresponding 
"Shading Schedule" for the window.

Is this what you were looking for? Hope this helps,

 - Grant

Interesting discussion; the reasons given for radiant in a high-bay
environment pertaining to stratification/infiltration make a lot of sense.

I have a related question:  How is radiant heat typically controlled in
either a high-bay environment or a residence?  The controls I have seen in
radiant systems appear to be on/off thermostats (I haven't seen many
systems).  I have heard the argument that the temperature setpoint can be
dropped a few degrees, but don't understand how that actually works with an
on/off controller.  

For example, assume that the space is comfortable at 65F when the radiant
heat is on.  Also assume that the temperature in the current hour is 66F.
Given the temperature, is the radiant heater off?  If so, then there is no
radiant heat effect and the space might be uncomfortable; causing the
occupants to raise the setpoint.  The net effect is that, over time, a
radiant system could wind up having the same setpoint as a convective
system.

A more sophisticated way of controlling the space would be to implement a
modulating control, but I do not know whether this is commonly done.  This
type of system would need to start adding heat at the same setpoint as a
convective system, but not in sufficient quantity to maintain the setpoint.
More heat would be added as the space temperature continued to droop, until
equilibrium is achieved around 65F.

Is anyone aware of field studies comparing the actual setpoints used with
radiant vs. convective heating in similar environments, where the occupants
are "uneducated" regarding radiant heating's "benefits"?

I think you're on the right track.  I don't have a paper to offer, just an
opinion that I have loosely correlated with field observations.  Reduce the
temperature for two reasons:  (1) People are comfortable at a lower
temperature with radiant than convection heating.  So reduce your modeled
inside setpoint a couple of degrees on account of that.  (2) Radiant
delivers major stratification-related savings as well.  With a 40- to 50-ft
ceiling and forced air heat, you might have to maintain 90F air at ceiling
in order to have 70F air at the 5-ft high thermostat.  That means the
average inside temperature is 80F even if the setpoint is 70F.  Radiant
won't have that problem.  So that would be another 10F reduction on the
average inside temperature.

Third, by eliminating the aforementioned stratification you will reduce the
stack effect-driven infiltration.  This can have a measurable effect on the
heating load if your building is not pressurized with a lot of OA.

Fourth, check your candidate equipment rated efficiencies.  Depending on
venting and burner types a radiant heater can be more efficient than a
convection unit.

Hi all,

I am currently modeling an overhead radaiant heating system in a large
industrial building.  The application is similar to a Public Works
garage, large overhead clearence (50' center height), insulated metal
building, space doesn't have to be heated but they need heating for
employees at the ground level.

I plan on using DOE2.2 because I don't have the budget for using a more
appropriate modeling tool.

Does anyone have good ideas about how to approach this using a DOE 2.2
model?

My initial thoughts have focused on reducing the space temperature
setpoint but how much is appropriate 2 degrees , 5 degrees or 10 degrees
?   Are there any papers or articles that discuss air temp vs mean
radiant temp of the surrounding mass while using overhead radiant
heaters?

Many thanks in advance for any help/guidance that can be offered.

All;
Be afraid of any savings computed using a lower space temperature. See 
ASHRAE Transactions 89-17-5 which showed no savings of IR tube heating 
compared to unit heaters and measured very high stratification in the 
space. While the MRT for employees at floor level can be equivalent at 
lower floor level air temperatures, these heaters seem to convect 
considerable heat up from the heater, leadng to high temps at the 
ceiling and perhaps no difference in bulk average room air temperatures 
that define the majority of heat losses in these spaces due to door 
infiltration. If air is exfiltrating at the ceiling at other times, the 
nice warm air will be the first to go. Some of the heaters will probably 
be installed with reflectors tilted to direct heat from heaters at the 
outer edge. Intuitively this greatly increases the upward convected 
fraction of heat output. The slab is also warmed which may lead to 
increased losses, though better comfort. The savings that can be shown 
via methods in ASHRAE Systems(?) are based on theoretical perfect 
distribution of heat from the tube, and no increased losses at the 
ceiling or slab.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200510281039.AA3902906pd80000838789@gard.com>

Hello everyone:
I am now encountered a problem in modeling an automatic pull down exterior
shades of a window, and am seeking your help. The radiation responsive
exterior shade will be triggered when the radiation arrives on the exterior
surface of the window pane exceeds a certain amount (say 30btu/ft2hr). Since
there is a relatively good insulation properties of the exterior shade (say
U-value=1.1 W/m2h), I would like to let DOE2 to take the insulation effect
of the shades when it is deployed into consideration. Do you have any
suggestions on how to model this?

Any slight comments will be highly appreciated!

Subject: [bldg-sim] Action Alert!  How should "qualified energy
  analysts" be certified for the new Federal commercial tax incentives?

I would suggest that for tax incentive purposes, a simpler energy 
modeling program be used than the DOE 2.1-based programs which are 
required for purposes like LEED compliance.  This would allow for 
single professionals like registered architects, LEED certified 
professionals or PE's to quickly estimate compliance without need for 
complicated modeling requiring  inter-disciplinary input and the 
associated expenses.

I may have missed the beginning of this discussion but the recently 
released NIST report (NISTIR 7238) "Investigation of the Impact of 
Commercial Building Envelope Airtightness on HVAC Energy Use" 
indicates that .02 AC/HR is indeed a reasonable assumption for air 
tightness in new comcommercial buildings if they are equipped with a 
carefully designed and installed air barrier.

Subject: [bldg-sim] Overhead Radiant Heaters
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200510280858.AA5811203pd80000838281@gard.com>

Hi all,

I am currently modeling an overhead radaiant heating system in a large
industrial building.  The application is similar to a Public Works
garage, large overhead clearence (50' center height), insulated metal
building, space doesn't have to be heated but they need heating for
employees at the ground level.

I plan on using DOE2.2 because I don't have the budget for using a more
appropriate modeling tool. 

Does anyone have good ideas about how to approach this using a DOE 2.2
model?  

My initial thoughts have focused on reducing the space temperature
setpoint but how much is appropriate 2 degrees , 5 degrees or 10 degrees
?   Are there any papers or articles that discuss air temp vs mean
radiant temp of the surrounding mass while using overhead radiant
heaters?

Many thanks in advance for any help/guidance that can be offered.

Mike

How is infiltration incorporated into annual energy models. 

What is a typical average annual value for infiltration if an estimated
0.5 AC is used for capacity calculations?

All who responded agreed that 0.026 CFM/ft2 was very low and that an
infiltration rate closer to 0.5 ACH was typically more realistic. No one
defended the use of 0.026 CFM per ft2 of floor area as a default. Should

Does anyone know the basis for the CFM/ft2 infiltration defaults in the
eQUEST wizard? The wind dependent infiltration default in eQUEST is 0.5
ACH
(based on my experience this is a very good default). However, the
wizard's
CFM/ft2 (wind independent) infiltration default is 0.026 (Note: 0.026
CFM/ft2 is 0.156 ACH with a 10 ft ceiling). In my opinion, using 0.026
CFM/ft2 instead of 0.5 ACH will significantly under estimate the
infiltration load in most cases.

Opinions and comments are welcome,

Hello Stephen,

There are some figures in the final report of the European Cephus
project (passive house), see p 90 4.6 Financial
viability. They range from an extra investment over current national
standards of 2% to 17%. These are for high energy efficient buildings
<15kW/m2.an heating requirement provided by internal gains, heat recovery
ventilation, high levels of insulation and high performance triple
glazing (maximises heat gain & minimisaes heat loss).
No additional heating systems are required.

Subject: [bldg-sim] Action Alert!  How should "qualified energy analysts" be certified for the new Federal commercial tax incentives?
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200510271904.AA0438500pd80000837347@gard.com>

Dear Building Energy Analysis Colleagues:

 

I am writing to you on behalf of the commercial subcommittee of the Tax
Incentives Assistance Project (TIAP.)  TIAP is a coalition of public,
private and NGO parties with a strong interest in effective
implementation of the energy efficiency tax incentives included in the
Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005, also known as the "energy bill".)

 

The commercial tax incentives require the use of "certified" computer
software that is run by "qualified individuals."  The Department of
Energy is in the process of making recommendations to the Treasury
Department on how these individuals should be certified.  A good fact
sheet on the commercial building tax incentives can be found at
www.nema.org <http://www.nema.org/> .

 

An excerpt from EPAct 2005 addressing this certification is shown below.

 

`(6) CERTIFICATION-

`(A) IN GENERAL- The Secretary shall prescribe the manner and method for
the making of certifications under this section.

`(B) PROCEDURES- The Secretary shall include as part of the
certification process procedures for inspection and testing by qualified
individuals described in subparagraph (C) to ensure compliance of
buildings with energy-savings plans and targets. Such procedures shall
be comparable, given the difference between commercial and residential
buildings, to the requirements in the Mortgage Industry National
Accreditation Procedures for Home Energy Rating Systems.

`(C) QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS- Individuals qualified to determine
compliance shall be only those individuals who are recognized by an
organization certified by the Secretary for such purposes.

 

In recent discussions we found that DOE views this as an issue and is
looking for some creative ideas on certification of energy analysts for
the purposes of tax incentive rule compliance.  The default outcome may
be to require a licensed design professional (i.e. PE, AIA) as a
qualified individual; however, many of the best modelers and analysts
may not be registered engineers or architects.  Also, unlike the
residential sector, there is no commercial equivalent to RESNET.  As far
as we know there is no certifying body for commercial building energy
analysts or modelers.

 

TIAP is most interested in maximizing participation in the commercial
tax incentives program in order to achieve significant energy savings.
We would like to see a certification approach that allows the greatest
number of qualified energy modelers and energy analysts to carry out
this work.  We are looking for workable solutions to certification that
do not exclude qualified modelers from this market.

 

So, what advice can the community of modelers and energy analysts
provide on this topic?  TIAP and the Alliance to Save Energy are looking
for input on the following questions:

 

*	Are there any existing energy analysis certification programs
that can be used as a model?
*	Is there any existing organization that could be designated for
certifying energy modelers?
*	Are there any training courses in modeling and energy analysis
that should be required?
*	What level of experience should be required for an individual to
be deemed capable for this work?
*	How should this experience be documented?  Are satisfactory
client references for modeling projects acceptable?
*	Which of the following designations indicate that an individual
is qualified for energy modeling:

	*	Licensed design professional (i.e. PE, AIA)?
	*	Certified Energy Manager (CEM) from the AEE?
	*	LEED-AP certification from the USGBC
	*	Other?
	*	No existing designation works for this purpose?

*	Is it practical to require no certification for energy analysts
and just have the licensed building designer sign off on the analysis
results?

 

TIAP would greatly appreciate your ideas and opinions as soon as
possible, but it would be great to have them by Monday.  Please post
replies to the list.  There are some meetings in Washington DC next week
where this issue will be discussed.

 

Thank you for your consideration of these questions.

 

Harry

Hi Renee 
 
While the article refers to US politics, it's not much different up here in
end result. The truth (as usual) is somewhere in the middle. It is very easy
to demonstrate diminishing returns on insulation levels, so there is a
science basis to the position that increasing insulation is not justifiable
(past a certain point - usually considerably higher than the industry is
used to providing, unless we are talking about Alaska, Yukon, NWT or
Nunavut). The Model National Energy Code of Canada for Buildings (MNECCB)
plotted the lowest life-cycle values for insulation and set them as the
reference point by region (degree days) and fuel type (based on 1992 fuel
prices).
 
What MNECCB did not do was calculate the impact of downsizing heating and
cooling systems in response to increased thermal control in perimeter zones.
This increases the complexity of the calculation significantly, but is the
beginning of the science based argument to show the benefit of increased
insulation levels beyond currently legislated limits. 
 
There is a growing consensus in Canada that the MNECCB needs to be upgraded,
and the complexity of the system will be under review. If you know of any
group that has undertaken these types of broad scope multivariable studies,
I would be extremely interested in the results. Of course, that's for
heating dominated climates.
 
Best Regards,
SFP

Reneee and list members:  

 

I'm brand new to the bldg-sim list, but well-acquainted with the IECC
code rollback issues described in the Washington Post article.  As one
of those quoted in the Post article, I'd like to refer list members to
the following two studies that were done by the ACEEE and NAIMA.
Descriptions of both studies are provided below and the studies are
available on the web at the links provided.  The original DOE study is
no longer available at the DOE web site as far as I know.

 

I believe these two studies represent good approaches to evaluating the
cost-effectiveness and energy savings impacts from building energy code
modifications.  Others contemplating similar work would do well to look
at these examples.

 

The answer to Renee's original question is that both politics and
science were involved in the outcome of the IECC in Detroit.  However,
building science did not prevail.

 

Regards,

Harry

 

 

 

Study #1

ACEEE study, Impact Assessment of 2004 IECC Wall Criteria Changes,
February 2005, William R. Prindle, ACEEE and Bion D. Howard, Building
Environmental Science and Technology

See: http://www.aceee.org/buildings/policy_legis/bldgcodes/iecc.pdf

Synopsis: ACEEE conducted an analysis of the impacts of wall thermal
performance improvements that were included in the 2004 International
Energy Conservation Code (IECC). The wall improvements were proposed
because the format change in the 2004 IECC de-couples wall insulation
criteria from window area, running the risk of increasing home energy
use. Because some parties voiced objections to these improvements, ACEEE
developed this study to provide a quantitative basis for the IECC
Committee and other parties to assess the value of these improvements.
Using a detailed building simulation approach and a federally developed
cost-effectiveness method, our study found that the modest wall
stringency improvements would save about 500 trillion Btu over 30 years,
saving homeowners over $7 billion in energy bills. They are
cost-effective on a lifecycle basis, even assuming a limited set of
compliance options. In fact, because the IECC allows multiple compliance
paths, the small stringency increase represented by the wall criteria
improvements can be met in any number of ways. Based on this analysis,
we recommend the IECC Committee retain the current stringency levels in
the 2004 IECC. 

 

Study #2

New Report Confirms Cost Effectiveness Of Increased Insulation In 2004
IECC

ICF Study Shows All Typical Insulation Products Can Be Used
Cost-Effectively 

 

Alexandria, VA (August 8, 2005) - A new independent study was released
today that measured the cost effectiveness of increasing insulation in
the 2004 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC).  The report,
conducted by ICF Consulting, an international management, technology,
and policy consulting firm which works closely with EPA ENERGY STAR,
found that in every climate zone there is a cost-effective,
energy-saving insulation wall scenario that meets the 2004 IECC.  The
final report concluded that the levels of insulation in the 2004 IECC
will lead to increased savings and create more affordable housing by
decreasing utility costs immediately and over the life of the home.

 

ICF conducted the study on behalf of the North American Insulation
Manufacturers Association (NAIMA) and the Polyisocyanurate Insulation
Manufacturers Association (PIMA). Simulating the annual energy
consumption of single-family homes, ICF tested homes configured with one
of four wall insulation scenarios using a combination of common
insulation materials that either met or exceeded the proposed code
requirements.  This data was then compared with homes designed with
insulation that falls short of the 2004 IECC. 

 

"The ICF study conclusively demonstrates the value of the 2004 IECC,"
said Charles Cottrell, vice president, technical services for NAIMA.
"The updated codes are a necessary step towards energy conservation
since so many homes and buildings are built to the minimum code
requirements. The increased levels of insulation represent sound
building practice."

 

ICF Consulting also reviewed an earlier report by the Pacific Northwest
National Laboratory (PNNL) to compare the research strategy used by ICF.
The PNNL study was limited in its focus by not taking into account
regional variations and only analyzing one insulation scenario that
would meet the code.  From its own results and the data included in the
PNNL report, ICF concluded the following:

 

In all climate zones, at least one of the wall scenarios had a payback
of zero years; Homeowners could receive an immediate cash flow increase
of up to $89 per year; Energy savings from increased insulation could
continue to accrue throughout the lifetime of the building, unlike the
decreasing value of energy-efficient appliances; and using rigid
insulated sheathing with medium-density fiber glass batt insulation is
the most effective insulation combination. 

"Aided by ICF Consulting's proprietary modeling tool, our analysis was
able to be very granular and present options at a local level.  We found
that locally and nationally, specific strategies for cost-effectively
increasing insulation levels are always available.  This is good news
for builders and home owners seeking to reduce the overall cost of home
ownership," says David Meisegeier, an ICF Consulting project manager.

 

ICF Consulting calculated the energy reduction into utility bill savings
and compared these figures with cost of materials, installation and
labor for several construction types.  The study took into account
regional variations of utility costs, material and labor costs and
housing characteristics. More than 1.23 million simulations were
conducted. For a copy of the report, go to www.naima.org/icf

I do not know the source of the infiltration defaults in eQuest but am very
curious as well. The infiltration rates change the heating load
significantly so it is something to examine closely for each building and
zone. 

Also, does anyone have any guidance for commercial building infiltration (or
exfiltration) rates by building type, core, perimeter, entrances, etc.? I
realize that commercial buildings are pressurized and exfiltrating much of
the time, but we can model that as infiltration instead and results will
likely be similar. 

I think this discussion has come up before, but maybe there is new news. I
just met with an architect in Boston, Wagdy Anis, who says his firm designs
to 0.02 ACH. It seems like typical ACH values should be re-examined.

Does anyone know the basis for the CFM/ft2 infiltration defaults in the
eQUEST wizard? The wind dependent infiltration default in eQUEST is 0.5 ACH
(based on my experience this is a very good default). However, the wizard's
CFM/ft2 (wind independent) infiltration default is 0.026 (Note: 0.026
CFM/ft2 is 0.156 ACH with a 10 ft ceiling). In my opinion, using 0.026
CFM/ft2 instead of 0.5 ACH will significantly under estimate the
infiltration load in most cases.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200510271144.AA4424828pd80000836577@gard.com>

We have the following configuration for data collection:
 
The logger gets power from the grid (i.e. no battery). Some sensors are
hooked directly to the logger, others are connected to a 4-20mA adapter
using cat5 and then the logger. The sensors are located throughout the
house, and they also get their power from the grid (i.e. no battery).
For some reason there is power outage almost every other day at the site
- post Rita, and it is creating havoc with our monitoring. The 4-20 mA
adapters are one-by-one going bust - resistor is getting burnt.
 
Any ideas/suggestions on what we could do differently to avoid the
problems? One idea is to get everything on batteries (sensor and
logger).

Hi,
 
Does anyone have a weather file for Beijing in bin format? There seems to be a bug in the Beijing.bin file I downloaded from the DOE2.com. The bug looks to be in the solar radiation because the Equest program terminates with error information as long as I set up daylight in the input and perform the simulation. Once I removed the daylight then the simulation works well. And I tried other city's weather file such as Shanghai's, the simualtion works well with any configuration(including daylight) in the input. I highly appreciate if any expert advise.
 
Thank you in advance!

John,

 

NFRC U factor is always calculated at the winter condition.  If you input
the NFRC U factor, SHGC and VT, eQuest converts U factor to Glass-Conduct
and SHGC to Shading-Coeff.

 

e.g if you input NFRC U-Factor as 0.4 and SHGC as 0.2, VT as 0.3 (From the
NFRC label), eQuest will convert the values as follows: 

 

"Window Type #1 GT" = GLASS-TYPE

     TYPE             = SHADING-COEF

     SHADING-COEF     = 0.229885

     GLASS-CONDUCT    = 0.434216

     VIS-TRANS        = 0.3



It uses the formula from the table you mentioned to convert the U-factor
into conductance. I agree with you that there is a difference in U factor
input and eQuest and the resultant window U-value in the LV-D report. My
recollection from my conversation with the developer is that there was a bug
in the reporting in LV-D though the program uses the accurate value for the
simulation.

 

In this case, it assumes frame width as 0.0. You will notice it in your .inp
file.

 

"North Win (G.N3.E3.W2)" = WINDOW          

   GLASS-TYPE       = "Window Type #1 GT"

   FRAME-WIDTH      = 0

   X                = 60.64

   Y                = 3

   HEIGHT           = 5.22

   WIDTH            = 8.11057

   FRAME-CONDUCT    = 2.781

   ..

 

I hope it helps..

Hello,

I am doing some modeling with EQuest 3.55 and am trying to understand two
things: How to input an NFRC window U-value, and how the DOE2.2 engine deals
with window conductance.  

For inputting an NFRC window U-value, the help file offers Table 2.5 under
Glass Conductance to convert between "manufacturer's U-Value and DOE-2 glass
conductance."  However, the conversion is different between summer and
winter, and conductance is a single input, not a seasonal one.  Is it really
a matter of doing a weighted average of the converted Summer and Winter
U-values?  I am leaving the emissivity at its default 0.84.

Once the conductance is fed in (1), the resultant window U-value in the LV-D
report does not match the conductance. I assume that Table 2.5 is intended
to add the air film, and I am not modeling any frame (2).  Does
DOE2.2/EQuest assume a frame of some sort by default?

Thank you for any insights,

John Weale

Subject: [bldg-sim] Beijing Weather file
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200510250806.AA0651218pd80000833399@gard.com>

Hi,
 
Does anyone have a weather file for Beijing in bin format? There seems to be a bug in the Beijing.bin file I downloaded from the DOE2.com. The bug looks to be in the solar radiation because the Equest program terminates with error information as long as I set up daylight in the input and perform the simulation. Once I removed the daylight then the simulation works well. And I tried other city's weather file such as Shanghai's, the simualtion works well with any configuration(including daylight) in the input. I highly appreciate if any expert advise.
 
Thank you in advance!
 
Glenn

Subject: [bldg-sim] wall response factors
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200510250354.AA545578pd80000833122@gard.com>

Hello everybody:

My name is Fernando and I am a doctorate student. I am working in energy
simulation in Buildings and I 'd like to know if the wall response
factors are still obtained as it is shown in the engineers' manual of
DOE-2, this is, obtaining the roots of the B(s) element of the wall
characteristic matrix and evaluating the corresponding series, so as to
find the inverse of Laplace's transform.

If this is so, I would like to know what is the computational cost of
this procedure, if there is a better way to do it, or a good algorithm
to find roots, and which is the usual number of roots of B(s) one should
take to keep needed accuracy.

Another question:

What's the difference between using periodic and ordinary response
factors? Is there an easier way to obtain periodic response factors or
is it necessary to obtain them fron the usual response factors?

Thank you in advance.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200510241714.AA1443250pd80000832650@gard.com>

Hello,

I am doing some modeling with EQuest 3.55 and am trying to understand two
things: How to input an NFRC window U-value, and how the DOE2.2 engine deals
with window conductance.

For inputting an NFRC window U-value, the help file offers Table 2.5 under
Glass Conductance to convert between "manufacturer's U-Value and DOE-2 glass
conductance." However, the conversion is different between summer and
winter, and conductance is a single input, not a seasonal one. Is it really
a matter of doing a weighted average of the converted Summer and Winter
U-values? I am leaving the emissivity at its default 0.84.

Once the conductance is fed in (1), the resultant window U-value in the LV-D
report does not match the conductance. I assume that Table 2.5 is intended
to add the air film, and I am not modeling any frame (2). Does DOE2.2/EQuest
assume a frame of some sort by default?

Thank you for any insights,

John Weale

Here are the responses through 1pm today.  74 people 
responded and the table below shows the frequency of the 
responses (use a fixed pitch font to see the table).

         Often Occasional Infrequent   Once  Never
Java       2       3          7          8     40
C          7       9          6          7     31

C#         2       0          3          1     49
VB        22      10         18          5     14
FORTRAN   20      14         16          7     12

JavaScript 0       3          7          6     44

  VB is Visual Basic
  Pascal includes Delphi/Kylix
  Lisp includes Scheme

Conclusions:

a) VB and FORTRAN are the clear favorites and it are 
probably too close to say which is most popular.

b) C++ and C are next.

c) The scripting languages, Perl, Python and JavaScript are 
used by just a few.

d) Microsoft's newest .Net languages C# and VB.net are 
still not used much.

e) COBOL is dead (at least for simulation).

Thanks to everyone for participating.
