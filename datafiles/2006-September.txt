Loughborough University have two permanent vacancies, one in the field 
of "Architectural Engineering", and a second in "Building Services 
Engineering". In particular, the post in "Building Services Engineering" 
may be of interest to some subscribers to this email list as the 
research interests of the Building Services Group include the 
application of building simulation and numerical optimization methods to 
the design and operation of buildings.

The vacancies are for the academic grade of "lecturer", which is broadly 
equivalent to the US grade of Associate Professor, the main difference 
being that the post would be made permanent following the successful 
completion of a short probationary period (however, note that a 
permanent position in the UK does not have the same security as US 
tenure position).

Details of both posts can be found at 
http://www.lboro.ac.uk/admin/personnel/list.html. the deadline for 
application is Wednesday 27th September.

Yours,

Jonathan Wright

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200609291547.AA4758687pd80001267946@gard.com>

Matt,
 
You should use the PVVT system type in order to model water source heat
pumps that have OA capabilities.  This system type allows you to use OA
heat recovery, specify two speed or staged volume compressors and
generally do all the things you cannot do with a packaged water source
heat pump.  The default fan speed control is variable speed so you may
want to set that to constant speed and set the MIN-FAN-RATIO to 1.   
 
This system type behaves like a packaged single zone system in that you
can attach multiple zones but the system is only controlled by a single
control zone.  This is in contrast to the water source HP system type
which is strictly a single zone system type.  If you specify multiple
zones under a single WSHP system eQuest simulates each zone with its own
heat pump.

	Another question on this topic...

	 

	eQuest allows the OA for, say, a heat pump, to come from a
dedicated OA unit.  What is the best way to model this system when the
OA unit has heat recovery on it?  Assigning it to a dummy zone will not
allow for any heat recovery since there are no loads in the zone.
Another way would be to add heat recovery and OA to each individual unit
and not simulate the dedicated unit.  However, eQuest does not allow WL
Heat Pump systems to utilize energy recovery.  Another option may be to
change the individual system type to Packaged Single Zone with a heat
pump for heating and cooling then set up each to use heat recovery.  

	 

	Thanks for any ideas.

	Scott,

	 

	You can designate a small portion of the building to be a dummy
zone, or you can make the zone float off in space away from the
building.  The important thing is that the dummy zone has no loads (zero
people, lights equipment, adiabatic exterior surfaces, etc.).

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] effect of window blinds on solar heat gain
In-Reply-To: <MDAEMON-F200609281140.AA401715pd80002148813@gard.com>
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200609290714.AA1421171pd80001267352@gard.com>

The attached report contains number of inaccuracies, which need to be
addressed for anyone that wants to make use of it.  First of all, "Shade
Coefficient" is non-existing expression.  There used to be something called
"Shading Coefficient", which was the ratio of transmitted solar gain through
a glazing in question and solar gain through the double strength single
glass.  This quantity is long abandoned, because it was true only for normal
incidences, it was somewhat OK for of normal angles of mostly clear glazing
and is grossly inaccurate for spectrally selective low-e coated glass, which
is starting to dominate market.  Concept of Shading Coefficient was so
problematic that ASHRAE decided to drop it completely almost 10 years ago.
I was the chair of handbook subcommittee which was in charge of fenestration
chapter when this happened.  As a transition, we provided some crude
conversion from SC to SHGC, with the caveat that is only a CRUDE
approximation for off normal angels and is to be used for measured SC data
that existed earlier.  
 
Then, report says that "Shade Coefficient" is calculated using NFRC and
ASHRAE approach.  Not only that NFRC nor ASHRAE do not use Shade Coefficient
or Shading Coefficient, but there is no approved procedure at NFRC to
calculate performance of windows with shading devices.  WINDOW program,
which is used by NFRC to rate windows, in its approved version does not deal
with shading devices either.  There is research version 6.0 (downloadable
from windows.lbl.gov), which can model SHGC of shading devices, including
venetian blinds and woven shades, but that is not approved by NFRC yet (and
it wont for another year or so, until it is tested and validated fully).
 
Finally, report shows how darker shades increase peak cooling load without
ever mentioning what is the SHGC of the window assembly, how is that
calculated, or what are the solar optical properties of the shade itself, so
it is really difficult to corroborate why would cooling load be higher.
 
Is there any technical documentation of the Carrier HAP program that would
detail assumptions and algorithms used?  One would expect for reputable
company like Carrier to be more careful with its "facts" and claims.

Hi,

Does anyone have any source that documents the effect of (interior) window
blinds on solar heat gain?

We are working on a project with motorized blinds that would respond to a
photocell.  The blinds are a fabric mesh that allows 40% visible
transmittance.

 

Has anyone used a reliable factor to account for any reduction in solar heat
gain from this type of window blind?

 

Thanks for any info that you may have!

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200609281424.AA2401125pd80001266219@gard.com>

Does anyone have any experience modeling a "Base Billing Demand" rate
structure in DOE2? I'm modeling a rate structure that bases demand charges
during the winter billing period on the least of 1) the maximum summer
billing demand (unlikely unless lots of electric heating) 2) the immediately
preceding May or October demand, or 3)current winter month's demand,
whichever is less. Then uses that kW value in a block structure of kWH/kW.

I'd love to use a series of ratchets, and can use them to describe each of
my three options, but don't see any way to select the LEAST out of the three
results and apply it to the current month.

Any ideas are appreciated?

WINDOW6 can model window systems with blinds and general shading devices.
Version 3.1 which is planned for release before the end of this month (next
few days) incorporate model for woven shades, which would be used for fabric
mesh.  The program will give you specific answer for your glazing system and
particular blind or shade.  You can download WINDOW6 from
http://windows.lbl.gov/software/window/6/w6_getacopy.asp and in a few days
there will be version 6.1

EnergyPlus will allow you to simulate interior window blinds and shades 
(as well as exterior, and between glazing layers).  On/off deployment of 
the blinds or shades on a time step basis can be controlled in several 
ways (see the WindowShadingControl input object).  You will have to 
define the solar and thermal characteristics of the blind or shade (see 
the Material:WindowShade or Material:WindowBlind input objects).  Also 
see the EnergyPlus Engineering Reference documentation for more detail 
on the calculation methods (Shaded Window under Daylighting and Window 
Calculations, and Shading Device Thermal Model under Window Heat Balance 
Calculation).

Hi,
Does anyone have any source that documents the effect of (interior) window blinds on solar heat gain?
We are working on a project with motorized blinds that would respond to a photocell.  The blinds are a fabric mesh that allows 40% visible transmittance.
 
Has anyone used a reliable factor to account for any reduction in solar heat gain from this type of window blind?
 
Thanks for any info that you may have!

Hi Nicole:

You need to specify which program you are using. This
is not a DOE-2/eQUEST site, but rather a forum of many
different and useful energy simulation programs.

I will, however, assume you are using a DOE-2/eQUEST
program.

By the way, Nicole, it depends on what SYSTEM-TYPE you
have chosen. So systems are central in nature, with no
terminal coild. Some have cooling at the AHU and
reheating at the terminal unit.

Correct me if I am wrong, ye DOE-2-ites out there, but
I believe: 

1)total central cooling/heating coil output

IS THE TOTAL OF ZONE AND CENTRAL AHU COIL..
 
2)total zone cooling/heating coil output

IS THE ZONE COIL (if present) LOAD
 
3) total cooling/heating capacity

IS THE SYSTEM CAPACITY, NOT THE PRESENT LOAD.

Can anyone confirm or deny these assumptions?

Keep in mind that the adjustment factor will vary depending on the glass it sits behind. Behind high performance lowE DGUs you may only get a 5-10% improvement due to the shortwave inter-reflections between blind and lowE coating.  Also the majority of the solar load becomes an instantaneous space heat gain as apposed to maybe absorbing into a tiled floor ... so peak cooling loads could actually end up being higher if the above two affects are combined.

The new Beta version of Window 6 (by LBNL) allows you to build a window
with interior blinds.  It will calculate the adjusted SC and you can
also import that file into EnergyPlus to run an annual simulation.

If I want to get the houly cooling load and heat load of a system, which
variable should I choose:

 1)total central cooling/heating coil output

 2)total zone cooling/heating coil output

or 3) total cooling/heating capacity

or anyone others.  If anyone has an idea about it, would you please help me

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Title 24 Vs ASHRAE 90.1-2004
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200609261107.AA0710796pd80001262157@gard.com>

LEED has addressed the stringency and 90.1 equivalency of T-24 in both
v2.1 and v2.2 - since the adaptation of Title 24 2001. T-24 2001 is more
stringent than ASHRAE 90.1-1999 and Title 24 2005 is more stringent than
ASHRAE 90.1-2004. LEED has developed an equivalency table to let you
take advantage of that without having to do a T-24 model and a separate
90.1 model. That table is posted on the LEED NC website for download.
You simply take your savings versus T-24 and then use a separate table
to determine your EA-1 points. 

It is important to note that the system mapping in T-24 is more akin to
90.1 2004 Appendix G than the old ECB method. T-24 also has different
factors for modeling occupancy lighting controls and other areas of
simulation interest. It is worth reading the ACM manual to get a
thorough understanding of the differences.

T24 has been approved for the use of both LEED-NC 2.1 (ECBM) and LEED-NC
2.2 (Appendix G PRM). As previously mentioned it could hurt your energy
cost savings if T24 is more stringent than ASHRAE 90.1 for either LEED
version. However, unless you are on the threshold of an additional point
in order to meet certified, silver, gold, or platinum - this is likely
not going to have a significant impact on your LEED rating. 

Therefore, if you find out that LEED Silver (33 points) is the project's
goal, and your project is at 32 points, then the cheapest point to reach
your goal may be to revise the energy model to ASHRAE 90.1. That is
assuming you have already exhausted the 4 LEED ID credits, which can be
obtained rather easily.

If it's LEED NC v2.2 then you'll have to use the Appendix G's PRM and
not the ECBM. But we may be straying from the original question...

Well - if its regarding LEED, it doesnt matter. If 90.1 is more
stringent, then you have to use that for your ECB analysis. If Title 24
is more stringent, why would you use it to compare? You would be
shooting yourself in the foot. I used to mistakenly assume that you had
to use the more stringent standard for comparison for EAc1. Thats not
true. The only time you have to use the more stringent standard is for
the EA prerequisite.

Architectural Energy Corporation (AEC) is pleased to announce a VisualDOE
training seminar on November 13 and 14, 2006 (just before the GreenBuild
conference) at AEC's office - 2540 Frontier Avenue, Suite 201, Boulder,
Colorado 80301. Each day of the workshop will begin at 8:30 AM and end at
5:30 PM.

VisualDOE is a whole building energy simulation tool covering building
envelope, lighting and daylighting, water heating, HVAC systems, and central
plant. VisualDOE version 4.1 build 0002 is approved as an energy analysis
tool for the IRS Tax Credit for commercial buildings.

The seminar includes two full days focused on DOE-2, the VisualDOE
interface, general energy simulation skills, and LEED-NC 2.2 energy savings
calculations for green buildings. Attendees are welcome to bring their
projects for discussion in class. 

No prior energy modeling experience is required, but a good understanding of
building systems and energy performance issues is very helpful. 

VisualDOE 4 is available at a discount to training attendees.  However a
free one-month license for VisualDOE 4 is included with the training.
Attendees should bring their own laptop computers to participate in class
exercises. 

The cost for the two-day program is $900.  Morning coffee/danish and
afternoon soft drinks will be provided each day.  Lunch will be on your own
- 60 minutes each day.

SPACE IS LIMITED - to register or get more training information, please go

Three ways to go about doing this, using the EnergyPlus program which
has a gas power absorption chiller routine which is all free. Purchase
Transys which has modules for simulating an absorption chiller. Or
finally refer to the post below 
 
We've done quite a few solar absorption modeling projects over the past
10 years or so for NREL, NRCAN and a few others but I'm not sure if the
results were ever written up into technical reports/papers. You may want
to check the NREL web site. 

As a result of these projects, we have a software tool that can be used
to assess the potential for this technology in commercial and industrial
buildings. Because the tool is based on TRNSYS, it can also easily be
modified to more accurately reflect your particular configuration. If i
remember correctly, the program was configured to study a system where:

1) the collectors charge a hot storage tank

2) a gas-fired auxiliary device provides backup during periods where the
tank can't supply the generator with hot water

3) the absorption chiller draws from the storage tank and charges a
second storage tank with chilled water for distribution to the load

I think we also have a version where there isn't a second tank and the
chiller feeds the load directly.

Let me know if you are interested in exploring this option and good luck
with your search.

Mike: 

Take a look at the Air side system parameters, under the "outside air
and economizer" tab. 

"Min OA control method" a gives you DCV options.

DOE2.2 Volume 6: New Features has a discussion of the methodology.

I hope this is what you were looking for.

Scott,

 

You can designate a small portion of the building to be a dummy zone, or
you can make the zone float off in space away from the building.  The
important thing is that the dummy zone has no loads (zero people, lights
equipment, adiabatic exterior surfaces, etc.).

I've read before that to correctly model a dedicated outdoor air unit,
one should assign it to a dummy zone.

 

How do I go about creating a Dummy zone for an outside air handler?

 

Do I just make a small portion of the building its own zone and assign
this OA unit to it?

 

Thanks for all your help. Any other suggestionss with OA units would be
appreciated.

  We use eQuest software in HVAC building simulation, in Romanian based projects.
  We need weather databases for locations in Romania and for this reason our intention is to buy Meteonorm software from Meteotest, as is indicated in eQuest Tutorial. 
  But first we need your help for solving one teaser: Meteonorm weather formats for DOE2 are with .dat extension, and eQuest weather files are with .bin extension.
   Do you know / or use in the past Meteonorm formats in eQuest? If you can help us in this problem, we sincerelly thank you. 
  We are ready to buy Meteonorm after we wil clarify this.
   
  Thank you in advance,

If you are looking as to what is happening internationally, in Australia there has been a fair bit of focus on energy & water consevation in all types of residential (detached, semi-detached and multi-unit).  

Up until 18 months ago we only had HER's which rated the envelope only at the design stage using tools such as NatHERS, BERS, FirstRate depending on which state you are in.  These are now being replaced by Accurate.  Each of these provide a star rating for each dwelling with local authorities / building codes calling up minimum star ratings.

The more interesting development (in the last 18 months) has been the release of the Building Sustainability Index (www.basix.nsw.gov.au) in NSW which covers both water and energy conservation.  While there is still a lot of debate on the black box calculations for the energy rating (% improvement on existing stock) it nevertheless is rating everything (appliances, lighting, AC, envelope, pools) in a dwelling aside from what you plug into the wall.  Currently high rise residential in Sydney has a 40% water savings target and 20% energy savings target.  Th state government is looking to up the energy target in 2008 but is under a lot of pressure from property lobbyists who believe the $10-25k premium/dwelling is economically unsustainable.

I would be interested in hearing about any similar schemes contemplated elsewhere in the World.

Graham

  Hi,

  I have a potential client who is interested in pursuing Energy Star for a new Massachusetts apartment complex with an affordable housing component.

   

  Having not done much work with residential construction or Energy Star, I am looking for some insight into how this might pan out.  

  Looking on the Energy Star website, I could not immediately locate any section of the site that dealt with new construction multi-unit apartments.  Can anyone confirm whether Energy Star is applicable to this type of project?

   

  If it is applicable, can anyone give me an idea of what is involved in attaining the rating?  

  Any appropriate links or other info is much appreciated.  Sorry if the question is too obvious!

Alec:

EPA's Energy Star programs for new residential construction are split along 
the same lines as the energy codes -- buildings 3-stories or less are in 
one category, those 4 or more stories in another.

If the multi-family building falls into the former category, the Energy 
Star standards are well established -- the Energy Star Qualified New Homes 
Program -- and are the same as for single-family homes.  Details can be 
found on EPA's website:
http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=new_homes.hm_index

The process involves getting the building tested/inspected/certified by a 
RESNET-certified HERS Rater.  RESNET maintains a registry of certified 
raters by state:
http://natresnet.org/programs/providers/directory.aspx

Unfortunately, the program is less mature for large multi-family buildings. 
Over the past few years a Multifamily National Working Group has been 
working w/ EPA to establish verification and labeling standards for Energy 
Star.  A pilot program is currently underway.  I would recommend contacting 
EPA directly for the latest on this new program -- or perhaps others on 
this list have more insight.

Alec:
For new buildings proposed to be designed that achieve a rating of 75 or

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] HERS, RESNET, Energy Star, etc. in Apartment
Complexes



Hi,

I have a potential client who is interested in pursuing Energy Star for
a new Massachusetts apartment complex with an affordable housing
component.

 

Having not done much work with residential construction or Energy Star,
I am looking for some insight into how this might pan out.  

Looking on the Energy Star website, I could not immediately locate any
section of the site that dealt with new construction multi-unit
apartments.  Can anyone confirm whether Energy Star is applicable to
this type of project?

 

If it is applicable, can anyone give me an idea of what is involved in
attaining the rating?  

Any appropriate links or other info is much appreciated.  Sorry if the
question is too obvious!  

 

Sincerely,

Alec Stevens, PE, LEED AP

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200609181821.AA2154281pd80001249139@gard.com>

Hello Kendra,
 
The following is a link to a blog I've started with the intent to
eventually collect all the arcane but useful scraps information
necessary to do these energy analyses efficiently:
 
http://elcca-exchange.blogspot.com/2006/08/equest-displacement-ventilati
on.html
 
There's link within this to an Energy Designed Resources paper that I
used (Which another kind user in turn had pointed me to) to set up my
prototype displacement ventilation system.  While doing so I also found
the screenshot in eQuest 3.6 that shows the 'lighting heat to return air
or adjacent space' (i.e. plenum) option that the EDR paper does not
mention.  
 
Assigning the stratified heat fraction using this screen may prove
useful in solving your problem... but I can't state that definitively
has I haven't had the chance to really test it out.  
 
If this does indeed solve your problem and you have a moment, please let
me know... I'll be getting back the simulation business soon enough.
 
Brandon

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] : eQuest Underfloor Air



I'm trying to use eQuest to compare an Underfloor Air System and
conventional VAV system.  I have modeled the Underfloor case according
to the Addison/Nall paper, and am having some issues with the return air
temperatures. 

 

I have modeled two stratified zones (a lower occupied 5' zone, and an
upper 8' plenum space).  A portion of the internal gains and window
conduction is modeled in the plenum space, and the return air path is
set to PLENUM.  I expected a portion of the cooling loads to be
transferred to the return air, raising the return air temperatures, and
allowed the loads in the occupied zone to be met with a higher supply
air temp (SAT).

 

However, when I increase my SAT for the underfloor case, my cfm and fan
energy increases accordingly.  I output hourly return air temps for the
two cases and found that they were the same - adding heat gains to the
plenum space did not increase the return air temps.  Further, I adjusted
my heating and cooling setpoints for the zones, and found that the
return air temps are equal to these zonal setpoints, regardless of what
load is imposed on the plenum spaces.

 

Has anyone experienced this problem?  

 

Thanks!

 

Kendra

This has be described in sevearl ASHRAE papers written in the early
90's. I can remember presenting at a symposium with Chuck Mac Cluer on
this subject also Athinitis at Concordia has published work on this
subject. The clue is to use the PMV to ensure occuapant comfort is
maintained and then do a series of runs to see what the lowest space
temperature would be still maintaining a minimum PMV of say -0.4.
Typically space temperatures in the comfort region are down at 66-68F,
so obviuosly the heat loss is reduced along with energy consumption.
This has also been presented at ASHRAE in one of the Standard 55
seminars and last year in a symposium in Chicago.

In eQUEST, there is a system type for in-floor heating: FPH for floor
panel heating.  

 

The manual suggests a lower setpoint is appropriate as the model is
driven on space drybulb rather than mean radiant temperatures.  Based
on one hangar model we worked on, I would suggest a space temperature
of 68F.

One technique used to model radiant floors in eQUEST is to do a Q=mc(delta T) calculation of the capacity of the radiant system for each thermal zone of your model (a hydronic system I'm assuming).  This number can then be put on a schedule in the "Internal Energy Sources" tab in the Detailed Edit Mode for Internal Loads.  Although time consuming, it is a more accurate way to model this type of system because you can also input sensible/latent heat gain ratios for the system.

Yes connect the OA system to the dummy zone and the IU or FC system (using
OA-FROM-SYSTEM) to the actual zones.

Provided you set your primary air volumes (the usual practice) then setting
the induction ratio very high (10 is the limit I think) is inconsequential
for a passive chilled beam system.  DOE-2.2 doesn't care about the amount of
induced air, it cares about the beam output.  I believe the zone coils /
beams will deliver the output needed regardless of the room to mean wate
temperature difference.

Thinking this through there are two ways to go about this depending on your
heating configuration:
1) Use the IU system only (no OA-FROM-SYSTEM) and use an outdoor air reset
schedule to ge the space humidity control you desire.  The optimal reset
schedule is very climate sensitive.  You will need to try a few and you may
need to bound the results using cooling from one and heating from another
... This configuration relies on zone heating (baseboards or other) to
maintain space temperatures and thus does not worry about cold primary air
potentially overcooling space sor creating drafts.

2) Where you want to control the zone supply temperature above a minimum,
and thus place more cooling load onto the beams, then you need to resort to
teh OA-FROM-SYSTEM I described.  In this case I have set the off-coil
temperature to a constant (conservative) rather than a floating off-coil in
response to the space humidity.  You can't do the latter without a dummy
building that closely mimics space sensible and latent loads.  I then
sometimes dump teh hourly results to a spreadsheet (coil temperatures and
outputs and zone humidity ratios) and calculate an adjustment to adjust the
cooling and reheat.

Regards,
Graham

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Ground source loop Vs Open tower
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200609131427.AA2749203pd80001241740@gard.com>

Dear all,

I am modeling a mixed use building (offices + hotel)  with a ground source
loop using water from an aquifer for precooling prior to using chillers (no
open tower). We donot know the aquifer depth below the ground yet but the
theoretical premise for modeling is 350' and the pump used on the ground
source loop would be capable of 1500 gpm with 450' head.

Can anybody, in principle, comment on the energy offset by (not using open
tower + reduction of load on chillers) Vs the pump energy for sourcing water
from an aquifer?

Thanks,

This discussion has been very helpful to me since I have just been asked to model this system.  

For clarification, you are setting up a dummy space & zone served by a SZRH sytem, right Graham?  What does your outdoor air reset schedule look like?

I am also curious about Paul's statement that the induction ratio doesn't matter.  Have other people experienced this?

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200609121639.AA3906828pd80001240477@gard.com>

This is a good discussion, I am glad others are trying to find work arounds as the humidity control and central heating aspects are not straight forward.
I am not fmailiar with the fan energy problems, but I am familiar with the following:

1) There is a lower limit on CHW DT across the chiller which I believe is 6DegF.

2) The OA-FROM-SYSTEM is the way to go in EQuest/2.2.  TAS, Apache and I suspect other programs allow the heating / humidity control to be handled more easily and accurtely but fall down on the waterside.

3) The OA-FROM-SYSTEM cannot 'see' the zones you are passing the air to so therefore off-coil temperatures cannot be directly controlled from the zone unless you replicate a dummy building that mimics your actual model's latent loads etc.

4) Further to #3 the OA-FROM-SYSTEM cannot see the zone heating demands thus space heating must be local by baseboards or by a 4-pipe IU/FCU.

5) Given above I have tended to se up my OA-FROM-SYSTEM as a SZRH system with the cooling coil off-coil controlling to an outdoor air reset schedule to dehumidify and the zone heating coils reheating to maintain a minimum zone supply temperature (nominally 15C).  In Australia we use this configuration as we have warm to hot and humid climates with a small heating load in comparison to most North American climates.  In winter the central heating coil (zone coil in this case on a SZRH) would heat to satisfy zone of greatest heating demand and other zones would recool.  Reheat and recool sounds inefficient but when the heating is done with CW heat recovery and periods of simultaneous heating and cooling are in cooler months when plant effcieincy is at a maximum, the whole system is actually quite efficient.

6) I then iterate on the outdoor air reset schedule and observe humidity levels in key zones to satisfy myself that I am getting space dewpoint control.

7) Ultimately with a chilled beam system that is most sensitive to space dewpoint control this is still only a good approximation that is time consuming to ensure it is right.

I mentioned last week that the EQuest/2.2 team could fix this up (IU system with no OA-FROM-SYSTEM, dewpoint contrl and central heaing / reheat) if the $ could be found - keep in mind we enjoy freeware.  Speaking with Jeff Hirsch over the years we aren't talking a lot of money but it is too much for me to justify paying 100%.  Anyone feeling generous or like me, frustrated at the time consuming work arounds, please contat Jeff and/or myself as this enhancement would extend the application of EQuest/2.2 dramatically (from my point of view).

Regards,
Graham Carter

  Eric,

  As Peter stated, an induction unit can have a dedicated system supply source (for Trace it is OA; for eQUEST/DOE-2 you specify source...OA or rom a chosen AHU).  The same is true with the fan coil unit.  

  For DOE-2.2/eQUEST specifically, there are a few of snags that one runs into.  One, the induction ratio doesn't really matter...play around and you'll see.  Two, DOE-2 doesn't seem to account for the fan energy used to pull off the CFM that goes to the beams...I'd love for someone to prove I'm wrong.  Three, I've had difficulties with loop temperatures and delta T for the loops...i.e. DOE-2 didn't seem to like the higher water temps going to the IU/FCU.  I'd like to hear feedback if someone else got around this.

  Trace had some similar drawbacks...I'll work on recalling them.

  Paul

    OK so you are talking about an active beam and not a static beam, right. Then you need an outside air supply to be incorprated into the conditioning system, so I guess the induction unit will suffice, just check the minmum turndown ratio and check the induction rate to match the profile of the active beam.

Holly:
 
Question #1 - I believe if you put the pump kW to 0.0, and the piping
losses to 0.0, you should lose nothing except what is called for by the
end use.
 
Question #2 - Are you calling out furnace for your heat source or heat
pump?  This would be found in the heating section of your RTU
parameters, not in the plant (Air Side, not Water side).

Good morning,

 

Question...The building I am modeling has one DWH (100 gallons) but is
not on a loop, but rather the water is sent out when a sink or
dishwasher etc is calling for it.  I placed a loop on my DWH in order
too get the system too supply water through out the building.  The
problem is that my therms are way high and I believe it's because of the
hot water loop.  How can I fix this?

 

Second issue, I have a very basic DX cooling system in the building two
20 ton RTU, and two natural gas forced air furnace.  But when I look at
the reports one of them the SS-Q states that I have Heat Pump cooling
and heating for my two RTU's.  Am I reading this right, if so how do I
remove the heat pump from my model?  I don't now where or how it got
added. 

 

Thanks,

Holly

'How Low Can You Go' Symposium

Dear Building Simulationist:

As you may know ASHRAE TCs 2.8, 4.7, 7.1, and 7.6 have been sponsoring a
series of
symposium papers on 'How Low can You Go?  Case Studies of Low-Energy
Buildings'.
 With the recent approval of 4 papers for the Dallas meeting in January, we
now have 14 papers for this 3 meeting symposium series. We are considering
requesting that this become a special publication in the next year or so.

But we are looking for papers for Long Beach and beyond! We have 3 papers
in review for Long Beach and 70 reviewers just waiting for your paper.

REMINDER--WE ARE LOOKING FOR PAPERS THAT INCLUDE MEASURED ENERGY SAVINGS
DATA, EITHER
UTILITY BILLS OR SUBMETERED DATA.

If you have a building that you'd like to write a paper for the Long Beach
or
later ASHRAE meeting, please let me know ASAP.  To meet the deadlines for
the Long Beach (June 2007) meeting, the final papers must be submitted by
mid/late October for  review, revision and final submission into ASHRAE no
later than 1 February 2008.

REMINDER--YOUR PAPER MUST INCLUDE MEASURED ENERGY SAVINGS, EITHER
UTILITY BILLS OR SUBMETERED DATA.

If you cannot meet the deadlines for Long Beach and would like to try for a
later symposium in 2008 or 2009 (New York January 2008, Salt Lake City June
2008,
or Chicago January 2009), please let me know.  I plan to continue pursuing
authors for this symposium series as long as we continue to receive enough
high-quality papers.

If you have any questions, please let me know as soon as possible.

Dru Crawley

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200609111036.AA3632968pd80001238390@gard.com>

Scott, I believe John is right. eQUEST will model the spaces as each
shell is defined (i.e. if you have an external wall defined colliding
with a space, it will model as an external wall). One way I've
successfully used the DD Wizard to define an adiabatic wall is to define
a larger footprint and then define a zone that doesn't intersect with
one of the outer walls. The walls are only created depending on the zone
in relation to the footprint defined. Therefore if a zone wall is on the
same plane as the footprint wall, you'll get an outer wall. When a zone
wall is inside the footprint, you get an adiabatic, interior wall. This
saves going into the detailed interface at this point.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Multiple building shells and the impact on mech
equipment

Scott:

If I understand you correctly, you have some of your shells spatially
overlapping one another. I believe your question is if somehow the two
areas will mix load.

I believe the answer is no. I have mistakenly placed multiple shell
virtually one on top of another (not knowing I had done it), and eQUEST
performed the simulation with no errors, and as if I had these two
shells independent (one was supposed to be a 1st floor and another a 2nd
floor - I had forgotten to use the Z component to raise the 2nd floor
up).

I hope this is the answer what you are asking.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Multiple building shells and the impact on mech

I am modeling a building using multiple building shells to eliminate
work in detailed interface mode. The shells are joined by an adiabatic
wall. 

 

In one case, due to my modeling technique, the real zone over laps from
one shell to another. In equest, I have created separate zones for these
spaces, However, I have assigned them to the same air handler vav
system. 

 

Will this work properly, and closely simulate the real situation?

 

Is there a better approach?

Thanks,

Hi, Holly:
 
I am assuming you are using eQUEST. This web site is for ALL energy
simulation programs, not just certain ones, please remember.
 
There are two obvious things i would check:
 
1) Are you getting ELECTRIC how water heating? If so, change your source
to GAS.
 
2: In eQUEST, you must be connected to a LOOP if you want a chilled,
hot, or domestic water load to be satisfied by equipment. Change over to
the Detailed Edit mode, go to the Water Side Icon on the menus, and see
if your DHW equipment is attached to a circulation loop. If not, you
will need to do this.
 
3) Do you have a reasonable SCHEDULE for your hot water load? Or ANT
schedule operating to give the hot water "life"?
 
Hope this helps.

having all my rate schedules set up correctly, I then do a run.  On the

Not sure what your ECONO-LOW-LIMIT is defaulting to, but this could lock out the economiser thus creating system cooling loads in winter.

  Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Space Cooling Question


  Hello,

   

  I'm modeling a multistory office building located in New York using eQUEST. The building has a heated basement (no cooling) and six conditioned floors (heating and cooling). Cooling is done via air-cooled DX units and a packaged VAV with reheat distribution system. Heating is done using boilers and a hot water loop feeding the reheat coils in the VAV box and baseboards along the perimeter. The schedules are eQUEST defaults. I am not sure what I am doing wrong, but I am getting a significant cooling load in winter. I am using OA temperature controlled economizer and compressor lock-out.

   

  One other strange thing that happens with this model is that both fan energy and demand go up in the winter. One should think that in the heating mode the airflow is set to minimum and the temperature is varied to meet the load. Therefore the fan energy and demand should be lower in the winter. However, the numbers I am seeing show that the demand for the fans is about 50% higher in the winter and the fans energy use in January is almost 4 times higher than the one in August. I have played with the night controls for the fans, but that does not help. If I select the "Stay Off" control instead of "Cycle On Any" I am getting rid of the cooling in the winter, but I am getting weird heating numbers in the summer. In June and August I get some gas use (???) for space heating, but none in July. I do not know what I am missing, but this does not seem right.

   

  Did anyone encounter these or similar issues? Any input will be highly appreciated. Please let me know if you need more details.

   

  Thank you,

  Dan

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200609012026.AA2656375pd80001226321@gard.com>

Assuming you are using EQuest based software you will have difficulty getting this set up the way you want.  TAS, Apache and I suspect TRNSYS and ESP will allow you to set this up the way you want on the airside.

With EQuest, if you can accept a constant off-coil temperature from your OA unit then set it up this way to guarantee humidity control, even reheat it to say 15C for a chilled beam system using a CW heat recovery coil and then pass this air to your main system using OA-FROM-SYSTEM.  I have done this and checked hourly reports throughly - it works.

The problems arise if you want to control your OA unit off-coil temperature on space humidity.  You will never get this just righ but you can try some approximations by setting the OA unit SAT on an outdoor air reset schedule and tune the reset parameters to get your space humidity levels where you want - iteratively lookign at hourly reports or possibly system humidity reports.

EQuest / DOE-2.2 are brilliant simulation tools that we enjoy for free.  I have been trying unsuccessfully in Australia to raise $ to get a few simple fixes made to the IU system humidity and heating controls that other systems with dewpoint control may also benefit from.  If anyone can see the value of making a financial contribution to enable Jeff Hirsch and his team to add more functionality in this area please contact Jeff or I.

Regards,
Graham

  Hi all,

  I am trying to model a dedicated outside air system with total heat recovery+demand controlled ventilation control and a separate VAV unit for cooling. The space needs to be maintained at 50% relative humidity. Any help will be greatly appreciated. 

  Thanks

Loughborough University have two permanent vacancies, one in the field 
of "Architectural Engineering", and a second in "Building Services 
Engineering". In particular, the post in "Building Services Engineering" 
may be of interest to some subscribers to this email list as the 
research interests of the Building Services Group include the 
application of building simulation and numerical optimization methods to 
the design and operation of buildings.

The vacancies are for the academic grade of "lecturer", which is broadly 
equivalent to the US grade of Associate Professor, the main difference 
being that the post would be made permanent following the successful 
completion of a short probationary period (however, note that a 
permanent position in the UK does not have the same security as US 
tenure position).

Details of both posts can be found at 
http://www.lboro.ac.uk/admin/personnel/list.html. the deadline for 
application is Wednesday 27th September.

Yours,

Jonathan Wright
