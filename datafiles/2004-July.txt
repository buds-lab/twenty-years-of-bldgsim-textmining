Hi All,
I am currently trying to model a gym which would draw in air through 
earthpipes that could be used for either passive heating or passive 
cooling depending on space temperatures and ground temperatures. The gym 
would probably need mechanical ventilation to draw out air through the 
pipes. The critical quesiton would be, what is the air temperature coming 
out of the pipes and how much cfm is needed to offset sensible+latent 
people heat gain and lights in the gym.
Is there a way of simulating earth coupled pipes in eQUEST. If not, 
what are the other whole building analysis tools that can simulate earth 
coupled pipes.
Thanks

Hi,

Can anyone guide me to the calculations of the heating load for an outdoor
swimming pool to be added to an hourly space heating load profile for
total? Is there a way to simulate that in eQuest or do I have to calculate
separately and increase the space heating hourly values accordingly.

The information I found on the internet for sizing pool heaters indicates
12 Btu/hr per sq ft exposed area per deg difference in pool and air
temperature, which I have tried to use and increament the hourly load.
Please advise if this is a reasonable number.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200407261848.AA4817703pd80000285558@gard.com>

I'm working on a simulation where I'm comparing residential split system 
type units to various fan coil systems and a WSHP system.

The default values and autosizing for the res sys 2 doesn't seem to be 
giving me an apples to apples comparison - the default syntax and autosizing 
are giving me wildly different total equipment capacities, zone CFMs, and 
zone conditions relative to the fan coil options.

I haven't used the res sys 2 system very much and I was wondering if anyone 
has some insight on which of the default values I need to look at more 
closely.

I have no natural ventilation enabled, and have tried it with and without 
infiltration specified at the zone level.

Both have the same minimum zone supply air temperature.

The overall energy consumption seems reasonable, but I just want to make 
sure all of the residential system energy is being accounted for in a fair 
comparison.

Thanks!
David

 Jason,

I got only one response regarding the eQuest validation study. My conclusion
would be either there are not many users of eQuest in the list or the users
are completely satisfied with the eQuest (or DOE2.2) and do not feel the
need of any validation study. I think as DOE2.2 is an improvement over
DOE2.1E, which was validated using BESTEST and many other case studies,
there may not be a need to perform BESTEST(or validation study) for DOE2.2
based programs such as eQuest.

I'd like to summarize all the responses and my findings about PV modeling in eQuest.  Specially thank Scott Criswell for pointing me to the right directions on this simulation skill.  Basically three steps to model a PV array system in eQuest: 
Step 1: Create PV Module under Utility and Rate Section
Step 2: Create a corresponding Electric Generator ELEC-GENERATOR on the same section
Step 3: Under the Utility Rate command, add Buy/Sell command if selling back electricity generated by PV systems to the grid
 
The description of PV module parameters is included in the DOE-2.2 Dictionary volume of documentation.  And example of a small commercial PV system is included in the 2nd to last page (or there abouts) of the same documentation.  http://doe2.com/download/DOE-22/DOE22Vol2-Dictionary.pdf <http://doe2.com/download/DOE-22/DOE22Vol2-Dictionary.pdf>    (~2.6 MB)

Fearghal,

In the Utility project tree, highlight the fuel meter FM1, right click, and
choose "create new fuel meter".  Then you can choose "Steam" as the type of
meter and enter your $/1000 lbs.  You will also have to change the meter
selection in the HVAC air-side systems and possibly at the zone levels
depending on your air-side system types.  I usually use the spreadsheets to
default the applicable meters.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] DOE 2.1E validation


In order to level the playing field in showing ECB compliance, it is
also necessary to explain how the programs (that have passed the STD140
test) are used in modeling different Energy Conservation Measures
(ECMs).  

For example the use of the DOE2.1E program for: under-floor air
distribution; occupancy based ventilation control using CO2 sensors in
the return air system; reduced ventilation with high efficiency
(carbon/ionization) filters; lake water cooling; occupancy based
lighting control.  Occupancy based ventilation & lighting control are
done with schedules, which are approximated by the program user.  In
this office we re-use the occupancy schedule.  There are several other
ECMs that require user determined schedules.  The validity of the demand
cost depends on entering all electricity consuming equipment in the
building such as elevators and the operating schedule of each equipment,
which is also approximated by the program user.  Establishing
recommended standard schedules will help.

The space perimeter depth and the location of light sensor in the space
affect energy savings from daylighting controls.  In the case of a space
with a high perimeter depth, the internal heat gains will cancel out the
heat losses through the envelope in winter and it is possible eliminate
heating energy entirely when it is -40 outside.  It is also possible to
show energy savings with incorrect and inappropriate input data.  The
program will produce results if the input is within a certain range.
Recently I tried to compare packaged VAV DX units (gas heating) with
GSHP.  I made all the changes required in the "System" module of DOE2.1E
for ground source heat pumps, but I forgot to change the system type
from PVAVS to HP.  I got results that sort of looked right.

I have been comparing the results from the DOE2.1E, TRACE-700 and HAP-4
programs for specific ECMs and a liberal conclusion would be that they
are approximately in the same ballpark.  This has to do with the way I
use these programs, my inexperience with some of the programs, the
incorrect use of the programs, and my lack of understanding of the
details of how each program models the various ECMs.  It is possible to
use these programs the way people drive cars without knowing the theory
of internal combustion engines.  In this office, mechanical engineers
are responsible for energy analysis and they have to follow up their
energy analysis decisions through final design and the responsibility
extends through construction and operation.

In order to level the playing field, the code authorities will have to
check the ECB compliance submittal program input data from different
programs that have passed the STD140 test to make sure that the ECMs
were modeled correctly. I think that this might require some
predetermined standard input and output reports from all programs.  The
best way of expressing the "intent" of the ECB method is with examples
and case studies of the use of programs.  I also think that
certification of those responsible for showing energy code compliance
might be necessary.  Are there any plans to check the results of the
energy analysis after the building is built and in operation?  What
happens to those who break building energy codes?  There is a self
imposed penalty of paying higher energy bills.  There is no risk to
life, health or safety.

This implies that for a building energy analysis tool to be allowed for

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Photovoltaic Module in eQuest
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200407211947.AA4750453pd80000278210@gard.com>

I am trying to simulate the electricity generated by using photovoltaic
in eQuest.  After creating the PV module under the Utility Section and
making the simulation run, REPORT PS-H (Loads and Energy Usage for
Photovoltaic Module 1) shows ZERO kWh generated by PV module.  Did I
miss something here?  Anyone has experience with PV module in eQuest?

Thanks,

Bing

 Hi,
  I'm simulating a building in eQUEST that heats water
using steam imported from a nearby steam generator.
The steam is purchased at $9 per 1000lbs steam. Im
just wondering how I could use this in the simulation,
I've thought about customising the gas utiliy option
to account for the cost and use of steam but im not
sure how. Any advice would be appreciated,
    Yours sincerley,
           Fearghal O'Connor

I am trying to evaluate indoor zone humidity conditions for a building
located in a hot and humid climate (Summer DB >= 115F, WB = 87F) with
cool winters (Winter DB = 50F, WB = 45F). Does the DOE2.1E program
Report SS-N (Relative Humidity Scatter Plot) work?  Report SS-O
(Temperature Scatter Plot) produces results for zones.  Is it possible
to obtain hourly zone humidity conditions from a REPORT-BLOCK variable?
I understand that the use of the MAX-HUMIDITY keyword sometimes results
in an error that is not reported in the BDL output.  Does the
MIN-HUMIDITY keyword produce reliable winter humidification loads?
Which output report or REPORT-BLOCK variable shows steam humidification
loads?

Clarification and a little background regarding libraries of building 
components in eQUEST:

I wanted to emphasize a point that Mike made about editing the 
eQ_Lib.dat file - and that is to make sure to create a copy of that 
library with a different filename before editing the file.  If you edit 
eQ_Lib.dat directly, then your changes will get lost if/when you later 
install an eQUEST update or new version which often include updated 
versions of the eQ_Lib.dat library.
Also worth noting - changes made in updated versions of eQ_Lib.dat 
distributed with eQUEST updates and new releases should get made to any 
custom versions you create in order to ensure that errors are not 
introduced when substituting your custom library in place of the default 
eQ_Lib.dat in projects created from the wizard in the updated program 
version(s).

Background information -
The reason that "Save to Library.." is included in the eQUEST project 
tree right mouse menus is because this feature is implemented for a 
Spanish derivative of eQUEST, called Calener.  The reason this feature 
is available in Calener and not in eQUEST is because there is currently 
a limit of 2 active component libraries for DOE-2.2, one of which is 
reserved for the default DOE-2 library (for all products) and the other 
(for eQUEST and derivatives other than Calener) is eQ_Lib.dat.  There is 
no eQ_Lib.dat for Calener because Calener does not provide access to the 
wizards.
Another limitation worth noting is that no single library can contain 
more than 3,000 individual components.
In the future, DOE-2.2 (and eQUEST) will be enhanced to handle a larger 
number of libraries and the limit of components per library may also be 
increased.

I hope this helps to clarify things.

Fernando,
 
You can create unique library items by editing the eQ_Lib.dat file in the DOE2 sub directory of eQuest.  The best thing to do is copy it and rename it first.  In the eQuest project properties you can than enter the name of the library you wish to use.  The default is eQ_Lib.dat.
 
You can define custom zones by floor using the Design Development wizard.  Simply create a new shell for each floor with a unique zoning pattern.
 
Good luck,

I'd take the 15-20% with a grain of salt. It all depends. 
We found that the fan energy penalty from running constant volume vs.
VAV was significant, which led the designer to modify the air
distribution system to further reduce pressure losses. Assuming
underfloor air distribution, the pressure drop in the supply ductwork
and the plenum itself may not be lower than a comparable VAV system.  If
the designer is careful about duct design and coil selection, fan
pressure may be reduced, maybe not. It all depends.
Marlin Addison and Dan Nall have a paper discussing modeling underfloor
systems. Their solution with DOE2 is somewhat complex but seems to deal
with many of the issues surrounding where the loads `appear' with
respect to the supply air.
One issue they brought up is heat gain within the underfloor plenum. No
easy answers but definitely a concern.

What you are doing is in the generally correct direction. I wouldn't
remove the lighting load from the equation just set the percentage of
heat going to the plenum at say 50%. I would calculate the ESHG for a
typical space and use the space operating temperature from the ESHG
calculations for the space operating temperature in DOE 2. Make sure the
supply temperature is 63F and check the calculated return temperature.
Don't forget to reduce the static pressure of the AHU down to about 2"
external. Compared to a conventional VAV your supply air volume will
increase but fan power will be reduced. You can also reset the chilled
water supply temperature to say 48F which will decrease chiller energy
consumption. You overall results should be about 15-20% less than a
conventional VAV.

Hi All,
I am looking for a method for modeling displacement

I could set supply air higher then the conventional

Is there more advanced modeling methods on how to

Alec,

 

I think the intent of the code is exactly to penalize an HVAC system (or equipment) that is less efficient than the Code one. The choice of local floor DX unit brings about issues of a less efficient refrigeration, less efficient economizer control (i.e., waterside vs. air side), that must be offset somewhere else in the building, i.e. more efficient glazing...Furthermore, nowhere in the code it is mentioned that the consistent HVAC systems must be used. 

It has been my experience that for the ecb model an air-side economizer should be used.

In general, the situation you have described is fairly common, and unfortunately the proposed design building is thus often penalized.

  Subject: [BLDG-SIM] another 90.1 ECB question


  Hello,
  In light of recent questions to the list on the ASHRAE ECB method, here is one that we are working on: 

  The proposed multi-story office building will have a cooling tower serving a condenser water loop.  Each floor has a VAV air handling unit with a water-cooled DX compressor, heat is rejected to the CW loop.  Economizer cooling is provided on the water side via separate WSE coils.  OA is provided to each floor's AHU, but 100% OA is not provided.  The waterside economizer coils can pre-cool the mixed air when the CW temperature is low enough, and can run in series with the DX coils.  

  Regarding the base budget building, the system map in 90.1 seems to indicate that a central chiller plant is required for this type of building (System type 2).  However, in general I think we are supposed to use consistent HVAC systems in the base budget building and the proposed building.  I want to know if we can use the floor-by-floor water cooled units in the base budget building so as to be consistent and to not penalize the energy performance of the floor-by-floor DX units compared to a chiller plant.

  Also, the language is confusing to us regarding air vs. water side economizers.  In 11.4.3, we are directed to include an economizer that meets the requirements of 6.3.1, where the standard seems to indicate that a system must have either air or water side economizers.  However, in 11.4.3e, the standard seems to say that system type 2 must use airside economizers.  The proposed design seems to meet the requirements for waterside economizers, but I don't want to penalize the proposed design for not having 100% OA capability.  

  Your thoughts on the above questions would be appreciated.

  Thanks!

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] another 90.1 ECB question
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200407131107.AA0725234pd80000264112@gard.com>

Hello,
In light of recent questions to the list on the ASHRAE ECB method, here is one that we are working on: 

The proposed multi-story office building will have a cooling tower serving a condenser water loop.  Each floor has a VAV air handling unit with a water-cooled DX compressor, heat is rejected to the CW loop.  Economizer cooling is provided on the water side via separate WSE coils.  OA is provided to each floor's AHU, but 100% OA is not provided.  The waterside economizer coils can pre-cool the mixed air when the CW temperature is low enough, and can run in series with the DX coils.  

Regarding the base budget building, the system map in 90.1 seems to indicate that a central chiller plant is required for this type of building (System type 2).  However, in general I think we are supposed to use consistent HVAC systems in the base budget building and the proposed building.  I want to know if we can use the floor-by-floor water cooled units in the base budget building so as to be consistent and to not penalize the energy performance of the floor-by-floor DX units compared to a chiller plant.

Also, the language is confusing to us regarding air vs. water side economizers.  In 11.4.3, we are directed to include an economizer that meets the requirements of 6.3.1, where the standard seems to indicate that a system must have either air or water side economizers.  However, in 11.4.3e, the standard seems to say that system type 2 must use airside economizers.  The proposed design seems to meet the requirements for waterside economizers, but I don't want to penalize the proposed design for not having 100% OA capability.  

Your thoughts on the above questions would be appreciated.

Thanks!
Sincerely,

Alec Stevens, PE, LEED AP

My opinion only, not as an authority:

System 6 (water-source heat pump with DX cooling) is definitely not an
air-cooled chiller or an air-cooled heat pump.  I'm fairly certain that
it is a water-cooled chiller with DX on the air side, commonly referred
to as a water-to-air heat pump.  Is this what you have?  This is in
contrast to generating chilled water on your load side, which would be a
water-to-water heat pump.  With either system, the modeling for
"proposed design" needs to be the same as what you model for the "budget
building design".  Also, be aware of the 6.3.1 and 6.3.1.2 stipulations
on water economizers.

Not sure if this helps!

Galen-

We have done several LEED projects with ground-source heat pumps.  All of
our budget buildings were modeled using System 6 as you stated below.
System 6 was modeled as water-source heat pump units with a cooling tower
and a fossil-fuel boiler on the water loop.  Although I agree the cooling
tower is not exactly what I would consider "direct expansion", none of our
projects have been rejected by the LEED review process.

I hope this helps.

What you are doing is in the generally correct direction. I wouldn't
remove the lighting load from the equation just set the percentage of
heat going to the plenum at say 50%. I would calculate the ESHG for a
typical space and use the space operating temperature from the ESHG
calculations for the space operating temperature in DOE 2. Make sure the
supply temperature is 63F and check the calculated return temperature.
Don't forget to reduce the static pressure of the AHU down to about 2"
external. Compared to a conventional VAV your supply air volume will
increase but fan power will be reduced. You can also reset the chilled
water supply temperature to say 48F which will decrease chiller energy
consumption.
You overall results should be about 15-20% less than a conventional VAV.

Hello:

I don't doubt that you get something like this...probably something in the
assumptions of your file. We've had similar experiences trying to match
other "calculators".

Try it with the ESL's calculator (which is locked-down for Houston...but
this will get you close...) and see what you get. The ESL's calculator is
being developed for the EPA and the TCEQ to calculate emissions reductions
from implementation of the IECC 2000 in residential and 90.1-1999 in
commercial. The calculator uses a code-compliant DOE-2 engine that we've
tested against RESFEN, MECCheck and LBNL's Energy Saver. Our new calculator
is due out August 31st, 2004 and will feature single-family, multi-family,
office, retail, solar thermal, solar PV, municipal (water, waste-water,
street lights, traffic lights, wind) and a before-after monthly utility bill
analysis.

I'd be interested to see what you get.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Cooling load in EPlus not similar to RESFEN3.1

I am simulating a typical residence (Brownsville, TX, weather file) using
EnergyPlus. The assumptions are similar to the assumptions for RESFEN 3.1.
The heating load is similar to that of RESFEN, but the cooling is about
1/3rd. I have been trying to figure what it is that I am missing for past
couple of days, but with no luck. The current file has a HVAC system, but
even with purchased air, the ratios are same.  One thing that I am not
simulating is the natural ventilation (which RESFEN simulates. It uses
Enthalpic - Sherman-Grimsrud method). So, if any one can tell me where I can
find a description of this method, that will be great. Another issue could
be the unconditioned attic and the conditioned living space interaction. Any
ideas on what the assumptions are in RESFEN regarding this? Also, does
RESFEN3.1 include any dehumidification?

Thanks. Any pointers are appreciated.

Bryce,

The CEC method is required for compliance purposes, but many use simpler
methods such as converting the SEER to EER by using a multiplier (0.85  to
0.95 are often used) and then converting the EER (95/67) to EIR using a
straight unit conversion.  RESNET which is the body that I've worked with on
software verification methods for nationwide HERS ratings for houses uses
the following equation:

Cooling EIR = 0.941 * (1/(SEER/3.413))

This was developed as a simplification to more complex methods and is based
on a regression analysis of numerous systems.  As I'm sure you're aware, the
conversion of SEER to EER is not exact and depends on the means by which the
manufacturer acheived the SEER.

There are then various assumptions about the part load performance of the
units, but that is another topic.

Good luck,

Pat

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Calculating EIR from SEER


I am looking fo a method of calculating EIR from SEER when no info is
available from the manufacturer for use in DOE-2's COOLING-EIR.  I found a
method in the "2005 Nonresidential ACM Manual, Express Terms, 15-Day
Language" text (page 2-80) that does this but there appears to be a typo in
the copy I have.

Equation N2-22 is:

EER(67,95) = 10-(11.5-SEER)x0.83 [default for SEER >15]
           = 10                  [default for SEER => 15]

Equation N2-20 is:

EERnf(67,95) = 1.0452xEER(67,85)
              + 0.0115xEER(67,85)^2
              + 0.000251xEER(67,85)^3
              x F(txv) x F(air)

where F(txv) = Refrigerant Charge Factor
             = 0.9 default
             = 0.96 for systems with verified charge

and F(air) = 1 for systems with verified airflow
           = 0.925 for default flow

and EERnf = EER with fan energy removed

Equation N2-19 is:

EIR = 3.413/EERnf(67,95)

Which is what I want to solve for.  My problem is with Equation N2-22.  The
switch conditions (yes, I typed it right) are not independent.  One of them
should be reversed to less than, but which one?  Does anyone have another
proven method of calculating EIR from SEER?

Thanks much,

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200407021321.AA2142125pd80000246332@gard.com>

(This announcement is being sent to a list of persons who had  
previously expressed interest in EnergyPlus training workshops and to  
several building simulation mailing lists.  My apologies if you  
receive this more than once.)    

Introduction to EnergyPlus for Experienced Modelers 

August 2-3, 2004, Boulder, Colorado, USA - Register by July 16!

The workshop will be held on the campus of the University of Colorado at  
Boulder immediately prior to the IBPSA-USA SimBuild 2004 conference, August 4-
6. For more details about the conference, see 

http://www.ibpsa.us/SimBuild2004 

This workshop will introduce EnergyPlus to experienced modelers who  
are familiar with the basic concepts of energy simulation.  The  
course will cover the mechanics of using EnergyPlus with an emphasis  
on aspects of EnergyPlus that differ substantially from other common  
modeling tools (e.g., DOE-2 and BLAST), such as the use of a multiple  
time-step approach, the integrated simulation of loads, systems and  
plant, and defining fluid and air loops.   

Fees:  US$250, registration closes after July 16. 

For more details on the course outline, registration, and hotel accomodations, 
please see:

Hi Building Simer's
 
I am doing some work on looking at the costs of various energy
efficiency measures and have found from the RS Means catalog that the
incremental cost per ton of roof top air cooled air conditioners (gas
packs) is around $1,000/ton.  This does not capture the small cost
increment of duct sizing.
 
Has anyone else done a more exacting cost comparison of the incremental
cost of decreasing HVAC size due to efficiency measures??  If so could
you please respond to this new  group and my colleague Mudit Saxena at

Dear John Davit,
Dear All,

We (at Geneva University, Switzerland) have been working quite a bit on
earthpipes. If you read french, you may be interested in my PhD (which can be
downloaded on www.solarenergy-thermal.ch/ecran12.htm => Recherche :
"Hollmuller"). Otherwise some preliminary results can be found in "Cooling and
preheating with buried pipe systems : monitoring, simulation and economic
aspects", P. Hollmuller, B. Lachal, Energy and Buildings, 33/5, 2001, pp.
509-518 and/or I can send you a ppt-presentation of main results.

Main results are :
1) If you want to completly dampen day/night temperature oscillation (which
might be sufficient for cooling in Mid-European climates), you need around 20
cm earth around each tube. Exchange surface (m2) should be around 1/10 of
airflow (m3/h). If tubes are beneath ambient, theyhould be burried around 60-80
cm deep.
2) If you want to completly dampen summer/winter oscillation (which is needed
for preheating in Mid-European winter), you need around 3 m earth around each
tube. Exchange surface (m2) should be around 1/5 of airflow (m3/h). If tubes
are (at least) 3 m deep, but in a plane and close to each other (instead of 6 m
apart from each other), exchange surface (m2) should be around 1/1 of airflow
(m3/h).
3) If tubes are close underneath building (< 3m) and latter is being maintained
over a whole season at a different temperature than ambient (like in
Mid-European winter), than the earthpipes will take (major) part of its energy
directly from the building, and not from the soil. This may give rise to a net
energy loss instead of an energy gain!
4) If earthpipes for preheating (winter) are being used in series with a
heatrecovery system on waste air, than (an important) part of the energy gain
by the pipes is being "stolen" from the heatrecovery system, which will produce
less (net gain by the pipes < input-output difference).

We have developped a numerical simulation module for earthpipes which takes
into
account sensible and latent heat-exchange between air and tube as well as full
3-dimensional heat diffusion in soil. The model has benn validated both against
several in-situ monitored systems as well as against a fully developped
analytical solution. Developped as a FORTRAN subroutine, it is fully compatible
with TRNSYS (and edited by TRANSOLAR as a complementary module to the standard
package). If links to a FORTRAN subroutine or to a DLL can be made, other
simulation environments might try to use the routine.
