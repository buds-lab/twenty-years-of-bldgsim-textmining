Yes. We have been unfortunate to have had a couple of buildings with
large glazed areas on the south east and south west facades. When the 4
rotations are used and averaged, the loads differ as do the annual
consumption.

Rotating the building is ridiculous. We have hard enough job as it is
explaining how the sun affects a building without having a standard that
quadruples an engineers simulation time.

what I would like to hear about is if anyone has done the 4 rotations,
averaged them, and found any statistically significant difference
between that result and the result if you just took the actual
orientation? I have done several and have never seen any real difference
in outcome. Often the 4 rotations cancel one another. That is why I
think it is nonsense (along with some of Brandon's points as well...).
if I actually saw a benefit/penalty then I might see some benefit. To
date I have not, but I have just a few examples. Has anyone seen
anything different?

Thanks Jason,

The 'burr' under my saddle on this issue is that the 'averaged
buiilding', and therefore the baseline to which all project EEMs are to
be compared, does not exist, not even in the simulation software.

While we may have four perfectly good orientations, any one of which
could be used as a baseline (think .SIM file), there simply exists no
.SIM file for the averaged building.  It would need to be created (as of
this writing) manually, and the result could not be used easily, let
alone seamlessly, as the baseline for alternative comparisons within
eQuest.

Suggestions:

1. Allow selecting the orientation closest to, without performing worse
than, the 'average total annual energy consumption' as the baseline.
This simple change would allow all baseline numbers to reside within the
analysis software.

2. Make this requirement optional, for those buildings which can benefit
from orientation optimization.  In other words, promote achievable
incentives instead of enforcing arbitrary punishments.

Wish I had more time to help out with 90.1 -- maybe next year!

Peter and Brandon,

This looks like an issue that you have a strong opinion so perhaps
consider contributing a better solution. Anyone can propose a change to
90.1. Further, if you examine this history of the ECB subcommittee, I
think you would find that we are open to good ideas and are trying to
balance multiple needs. The building rotation concept replaced a much
worse concept of spreading the windows around the building evenly.
  Maybe you can find a better solution. I believe we need to reward
those that do make an effort to orient their building
  and windows to save energy and penalize those that make poor design
choices about building orientation and window placement.  The building
rotation idea has traction because most of the effort needed for each
rotation is just to rerun the simulation with the building azimuth
changed. We thought that was simple.  It is an issue that has been
discussed many times in the ECB subcommittee and a few times at the full
committee level.

I look forward to your suggestions.

Jason

I've done one recent Appendix G model (small building) where form and
orientation made a major impact (on the order of 10-15% overall building
energy versus Appendix G Baseline - tied only to form & orientation).  I've
also seen one or two other buildings where there was a major impact.  For
the other 85%+ of ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G models I've recently modeled
or reviewed, there has been minimal impact from re-orienting the buildings
(~0-2%); generally this is because these buildings are internally load
dominated buildings OR they have fairly boring footprints, with each of the
four orientations similar to one another.

Our office did a massing study years ago for a very large high-rise office
building with a relatively large footprint, that showed a savings of as much
as 6% based on form and orientation (prior to treatment of window surfaces,
etc.), so there is the potential for real savings even for internally load
dominated buildings.

I certainly enjoy working on energy models where the energy model can be
used to inform the design process with regards to building massing.

The ONLY time (of the few I have done) I found a 7% difference in gas
energy was when the building was essentially built into the side of
foothills. One side of the building was mostly underground wall, the
opposite side totally exposed.
 
Rotating the building THEN was a big deal gas wise. Yet the direction it
actually faced (West) had the lowest gas usage. So the EEMs I had for
gas showed greater that to be expected savings.
 
I believe Galileo had the Pope come to his house and showed him Jupiter
in the telescope. The Pope said that, yes, he could SEE it, but he would
not BELIEVE it.
 
Such is legislation..

what I would like to hear about is if anyone has done the 4 rotations,
averaged them, and found any statistically significant difference
between that result and the result if you just took the actual
orientation? I have done several and have never seen any real difference
in outcome. Often the 4 rotations cancel one another. That is why I
think it is nonsense (along with some of Brandon's points as well...).
if I actually saw a benefit/penalty then I might see some benefit. To
date I have not, but I have just a few examples. Has anyone seen
anything different?

Thanks Jason,

The 'burr' under my saddle on this issue is that the 'averaged
buiilding', and therefore the baseline to which all project EEMs are to
be compared, does not exist, not even in the simulation software.

While we may have four perfectly good orientations, any one of which
could be used as a baseline (think .SIM file), there simply exists no
.SIM file for the averaged building.  It would need to be created (as of
this writing) manually, and the result could not be used easily, let
alone seamlessly, as the baseline for alternative comparisons within
eQuest.

Suggestions:

1. Allow selecting the orientation closest to, without performing worse
than, the 'average total annual energy consumption' as the baseline.
This simple change would allow all baseline numbers to reside within the
analysis software.

2. Make this requirement optional, for those buildings which can benefit
from orientation optimization.  In other words, promote achievable
incentives instead of enforcing arbitrary punishments.

Wish I had more time to help out with 90.1 -- maybe next year!

Peter and Brandon,

This looks like an issue that you have a strong opinion so perhaps
consider contributing a better solution. Anyone can propose a change to
90.1. Further, if you examine this history of the ECB subcommittee, I
think you would find that we are open to good ideas and are trying to
balance multiple needs. The building rotation concept replaced a much
worse concept of spreading the windows around the building evenly.
  Maybe you can find a better solution. I believe we need to reward
those that do make an effort to orient their building
  and windows to save energy and penalize those that make poor design
choices about building orientation and window placement.  The building
rotation idea has traction because most of the effort needed for each
rotation is just to rerun the simulation with the building azimuth
changed. We thought that was simple.  It is an issue that has been
discussed many times in the ECB subcommittee and a few times at the full
committee level.

I look forward to your suggestions.

Jason

Brandon,

I recently made a proposal to the ASHRAE Standard 90.1 Committee to add
the following exception to the rotation requirement.

?If it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Rating
Authority that the building orientation is dictated by site
considerations.?

After quite a bit of discussion, the change was voted down handily. The
committee?s feeling seemed to be that energy performance of a building
should be judged on many things, including the orientation of a
building, regardless of whether or not there are orientation options
available on the particular site someone chose to build on. If someone
builds on a site that allows optimal orientation and thus better energy
performance, the rating should show that as well as the reverse
condition. While the discussion did not include existing buildings, my
feeling is that the outcome would be similar. Frankly, after listening
to all the committee?s discussion I was tempted to vote against my own
proposal.

All,
 
The building rotation requirement is utterly nonsensical.  For a
full-text rant on the subject, see my previous post:
 
http://www.gard.com/ml/bldg-sim-archive/msg04038.html 
 
In summary:
 
1) In the case of many new buildings (90% or more I would estimate),
there is very little latitude for changing the orientation.  For
example
the main street and therefore the lobby and entryway may be on one
side
and one side only of the building, the aspect ratio of the building
may
not fit on the lot in two of the four orientations, etc.
 
2) The fictitious, etheral 'averaged' building does not exist even in
the computer code of the best analysis programs we have at our
disposal
to date. 
 
3) All baseline numbers for each of the four orientations would need
to
be extracted from the analysis software, and averaged on a
spreadsheet.
Similarly each and every EEM would need to be extracted, and the
project's comparative analysis done on a spreadsheet instead of the
within the analysis software itself.  Thanks, but I have a life, wife
and family.
 
4) If this requirement still sounds like a good idea from the comfort
of
your tenured office, I say come on out and run couple of dozen
real-life
energy code and LEED compliance simulations for me within budget and
on
deadline in Q1-Q2 2008 and you'll begin to understand what I'm talking
about.
 
Why not simply allow selecting the orientation closest to, without
performing worse than, the 'average' as the baseline?  This simple
change would allow the baseline numbers to reside within the analysis
software.
 
Alternatively the eQuest developers are rumored to be working on a
90.1
Appendix G compliance module.  Upon release, if it automates the
averaging I may be inclined retire some portion of this diatribe.  
 
Best idea yet, drop this as a requirement, and make it optional where
it
makes sense to do so. Utilize by default the far more intuitive (and
useful in terms of energy incentives) 'code minimum' baseline
building,
oriented identically to the proposed.  This is the approach I've been
able to convince our state energy code and utility rebate reviewers to
accept -- its just hardened LEED extremists who still seem to have
their
head in the sand on this.

Can you not apply various fenestrations and shading to the model
without
having to change its orientation? For an existing building, including
LEED EB, what additional benefit could be gained by rotating the model
since you cannot change the orientation?

This is true, however, even with an existing building, you as the
designer/engineer have the option of "working" the facades and
applying
appropriate fenestration, shading, etc... you can still make good/bad
decisions and the fact that your footprint is fixed should not give
the
design team a waiver from the fact that the sun still rises in the
east
and sets in the west.  In fact it may be a benefit if perhaps your
building is shaded on the west by itself.

Here is my question to and response from the USGBC regarding this
issue:

  
  
Dear LEED Info, 
  
There has been a lot of chat on this item and I wonder if there is a
USGBC position - I found no reference to this in the CIR's: 
  
Do existing buildings undergoing renovation require the four-point
compass orientation analysis? 
  
  
  
Jeffrey, 
  
If the existing building being renovated is pursuing LEED-NC rather
than
LEED-EB, then it would indeed be required to undergo the specified
analysis.  This analysis is used to establish the baseline for energy
performance using the ASHRAE standard.  LEED doesn't have any specific
exemptions for existing buildings in this requirement, but if ASHRAE
has
some kind of exemption, we will honor that. 
  
  
So I guess the question then becomes an interpretation of the Appendix
G
(Table G3.1 (f)) comment for existing buildings. Rotate or not? 
  
My take has always been that new buildings have the option to consider
orientation but existing buildings cannot be re-oriented so rotating
the
model does not really prove anything. 
  
Any 90.1 code committee members or others out there have an
interpretation?

I am not the authority, Keith, but I believe that your interpretation
(that existing buildings do not get rotated in the baseline) is
consistent with the intent of Appendix G.  In new construction, the
decisions regarding building orientation will affect performance and
that performance should be measured against the baseline (although,
there are cases, such as a building that adjoins buildings to either
side, where rotating the baseline through all four orientations does
not
make sense).  If you're improving an existing building, the existing
conditions of building enclosure components, including orientation,
are
an appropriate baseline.  When we apply Appendix G to existing
buildings, we have also found that "existing building envelopes"
sometimes needs to be parsed into existing building envelope
components.
For example, in a mill rehab, the bearing walls may be serviceable and
appropriately modeled "as is" in the baseline, but missing windows or
windows that are clearly not serviceable we model as per the ASHRAE
minimum compliance. 
  
You should note, also, that an addendum to the standard has removed
the
provision in the table under G3.1, 5c to distribute windows uniformly
in
horizontal bands across the four orientations.  That should make all
of
our lives easier.

Right, and that is exactly the point of the rotation, to capture those

For example, in a mill rehab, the bearing walls may be serviceable and
appropriately modeled "as is" in the baseline, but missing windows or
windows that are clearly not serviceable we model as per the ASHRAE
minimum compliance. 
  
You should note, also, that an addendum to the standard has removed the
provision in the table under G3.1, 5c to distribute windows uniformly in
horizontal bands across the four orientations.  That should make all of
our lives easier.

I am modeling an existing building for Energy & Atmosphere Credit 1:
Optimize Energy Performance. In LEED and table G3.1 No. 5(a) of ASHREA
Standard 90.1-2004, it states that "the baseline building performance
shall be generated by simulating the building with its actual
orientation and again after rotating the entire building 90, 180, 270
degrees, then averaging the results". However table G3.1 No. 5(f) of
ASHREA Standard 90.1-2004 states: "for existing building envelopes, the
baseline building design shall reflect existing conditions prior to any
revisions that are part of the scope of work being evaluated." Would
this mean that you do not need to simulate the building for the four
orientations? It just doesn't seem to make sense to simulate the
building in such a manner if it is existing. I am new energy modeling
for LEED credit and sincerely appreciate any assistance.

Yes, we did a lot of cases about 5 months but I haven't had time to
summarize them.  Combinations of % glazing and other variables (aspect
ratio, etc.)

what I would like to hear about is if anyone has done the 4 rotations,
averaged them, and found any statistically significant difference
between that result and the result if you just took the actual
orientation? I have done several and have never seen any real difference
in outcome. Often the 4 rotations cancel one another. That is why I
think it is nonsense (along with some of Brandon's points as well...).
if I actually saw a benefit/penalty then I might see some benefit. To
date I have not, but I have just a few examples. Has anyone seen
anything different?

Thanks Jason,

The 'burr' under my saddle on this issue is that the 'averaged
buiilding', and therefore the baseline to which all project EEMs are to
be compared, does not exist, not even in the simulation software.

While we may have four perfectly good orientations, any one of which
could be used as a baseline (think .SIM file), there simply exists no
.SIM file for the averaged building.  It would need to be created (as of
this writing) manually, and the result could not be used easily, let
alone seamlessly, as the baseline for alternative comparisons within
eQuest.

Suggestions:

1. Allow selecting the orientation closest to, without performing worse
than, the 'average total annual energy consumption' as the baseline.
This simple change would allow all baseline numbers to reside within the
analysis software.

2. Make this requirement optional, for those buildings which can benefit
from orientation optimization.  In other words, promote achievable
incentives instead of enforcing arbitrary punishments.

Wish I had more time to help out with 90.1 -- maybe next year!

Peter and Brandon,

This looks like an issue that you have a strong opinion so perhaps
consider contributing a better solution. Anyone can propose a change to
90.1. Further, if you examine this history of the ECB subcommittee, I
think you would find that we are open to good ideas and are trying to
balance multiple needs. The building rotation concept replaced a much
worse concept of spreading the windows around the building evenly.
  Maybe you can find a better solution. I believe we need to reward
those that do make an effort to orient their building
  and windows to save energy and penalize those that make poor design
choices about building orientation and window placement.  The building
rotation idea has traction because most of the effort needed for each
rotation is just to rerun the simulation with the building azimuth
changed. We thought that was simple.  It is an issue that has been
discussed many times in the ECB subcommittee and a few times at the full
committee level.

I look forward to your suggestions.

Jason

We are never going to get anywhere using Proposed Building Performance
column in Appendix G3.1, it creates an abstract reference that has no
basis in reality. Using it is why there is so much gaming going on the
LEED world, and why LEED is so rapidly is losing creditability among
energy professionals. Ed Mazria has the best approach, use 50% of CBECS
via Target Finder to set the benchmark and then move that bar to energy
neutrality by 2030. Yes, CBECS has limitations as far as building types
and distribution in some locations, but let's work on EIA to improve on
that. So set the benchmark based on 50% of CBECS, run your project using
the rule set in the Baseline Building Performance column in Appendix
G3.1 and the percent difference becomes your performance score. Moving
Appendix G from an informative to a normative appendix will not solve
the problem. That would only institutionalize a flawed approach.

Subject: Re: [BLDG-SIM] LEED Building Orientation

Peter and Brandon,

This looks like an issue that you have a strong opinion so perhaps
consider contributing a better solution. Anyone can propose a change to
90.1. Further, if you examine this history of the ECB subcommittee, I
think you would find that we are open to good ideas and are trying to
balance multiple needs. The building rotation concept replaced a much
worse concept of spreading the windows around the building evenly.
  Maybe you can find a better solution. I believe we need to reward
those that do make an effort to orient their building
  and windows to save energy and penalize those that make poor design
choices about building orientation and window placement.  The building
rotation idea has traction because most of the effort needed for each
rotation is just to rerun the simulation with the building azimuth
changed. We thought that was simple.  It is an issue that has been
discussed many times in the ECB subcommittee and a few times at the full
committee level.

I look forward to your suggestions.

Jason

what I would like to hear about is if anyone has done the 4 rotations,
averaged them, and found any statistically significant difference
between that result and the result if you just took the actual
orientation? I have done several and have never seen any real difference
in outcome. Often the 4 rotations cancel one another. That is why I
think it is nonsense (along with some of Brandon's points as well...).
if I actually saw a benefit/penalty then I might see some benefit. To
date I have not, but I have just a few examples. Has anyone seen
anything different?

Thanks Jason,

The 'burr' under my saddle on this issue is that the 'averaged
buiilding', and therefore the baseline to which all project EEMs are to
be compared, does not exist, not even in the simulation software.

While we may have four perfectly good orientations, any one of which
could be used as a baseline (think .SIM file), there simply exists no
.SIM file for the averaged building.  It would need to be created (as of
this writing) manually, and the result could not be used easily, let
alone seamlessly, as the baseline for alternative comparisons within
eQuest.

Suggestions:

1. Allow selecting the orientation closest to, without performing worse
than, the 'average total annual energy consumption' as the baseline.
This simple change would allow all baseline numbers to reside within the
analysis software.

2. Make this requirement optional, for those buildings which can benefit
from orientation optimization.  In other words, promote achievable
incentives instead of enforcing arbitrary punishments.

Wish I had more time to help out with 90.1 -- maybe next year!

Sonal,

I believe you should be looking at L2A not L2B. L2B is for existing
buildings while L2A is for new buildings. L2A would be a better
comparison to 90.1. 

It is hard to say which is more stringent. L2A goes after heat issues
aggressively while weaker on cooling and central HVAC. The reason for
this is that cooling and central HVAC are not that big of an issue in
Britain. I have generally found that British and European codes to be
stringent then 90.1-2004. What I like about L2A is that the performance
path is CO2 and not energy based, which is what ASHRAE should be
thinking about doing.

I hope this was helpful.

Regards

Harvey

Does anyone know which is more stringent - ASHRAE 90.1-2004 or PART L2B

I am not sure how to check which code is more stringent.

Thanks Jason,

The 'burr' under my saddle on this issue is that the 'averaged
buiilding', and therefore the baseline to which all project EEMs are to
be compared, does not exist, not even in the simulation software.

While we may have four perfectly good orientations, any one of which
could be used as a baseline (think .SIM file), there simply exists no
.SIM file for the averaged building.  It would need to be created (as of
this writing) manually, and the result could not be used easily, let
alone seamlessly, as the baseline for alternative comparisons within
eQuest.

Suggestions:

1. Allow selecting the orientation closest to, without performing worse
than, the 'average total annual energy consumption' as the baseline.
This simple change would allow all baseline numbers to reside within the
analysis software.

2. Make this requirement optional, for those buildings which can benefit
from orientation optimization.  In other words, promote achievable
incentives instead of enforcing arbitrary punishments.

Wish I had more time to help out with 90.1 -- maybe next year!

Peter and Brandon,

This looks like an issue that you have a strong opinion so perhaps
consider contributing a better solution. Anyone can propose a change to
90.1. Further, if you examine this history of the ECB subcommittee, I
think you would find that we are open to good ideas and are trying to
balance multiple needs. The building rotation concept replaced a much
worse concept of spreading the windows around the building evenly.
  Maybe you can find a better solution. I believe we need to reward
those that do make an effort to orient their building
  and windows to save energy and penalize those that make poor design
choices about building orientation and window placement.  The building
rotation idea has traction because most of the effort needed for each
rotation is just to rerun the simulation with the building azimuth
changed. We thought that was simple.  It is an issue that has been
discussed many times in the ECB subcommittee and a few times at the full
committee level.

I look forward to your suggestions.

Jason

Hello,
Does anyone know if there are any building simulation user groups in southeast Florida, U.S.  (i.e. Miami, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm)?
If not, would anyone located in this area be interested in forming a user group in the new year?  I'd be willing to organize it.

Bldg Sim Community,
 
All we are saying (from the perspective of 90.1 and yes, surprise some
of us actually do design buildings (but we could use more!!!!(plug
here))) is that orientation DOES matter.  Yes you may have site
constraints, yes you may have programmatic constrains, but the fact
remains, the DESIGN team needs to be aware of where they are putting
glass, and design with the site and site resources/opportunities.
 
Thanks

Here here Brandon. A building is a building and that's that. I have sat
through many charette's  on 'tree hugging' projects to hear how the
buildings orientation can affect the cooling and heating load, let alone
natural daylighting. Only to hear the wise men of 90.1 (who have never
designed a building) to come up with some 'weighted' average to change
the results. The designer ends up doing four different runs only to find
out that the architect didn't have clue what he was trying to do in the
first place.

 

Long live sanity.

All,

 

The building rotation requirement is utterly nonsensical.  For a
full-text rant on the subject, see my previous post:

 

http://www.gard.com/ml/bldg-sim-archive/msg04038.html 

 

In summary:

 

1) In the case of many new buildings (90% or more I would estimate),
there is very little latitude for changing the orientation.  For example
the main street and therefore the lobby and entryway may be on one side
and one side only of the building, the aspect ratio of the building may
not fit on the lot in two of the four orientations, etc.

 

2) The fictitious, etheral 'averaged' building does not exist even in
the computer code of the best analysis programs we have at our disposal
to date. 

 

3) All baseline numbers for each of the four orientations would need to
be extracted from the analysis software, and averaged on a spreadsheet.
Similarly each and every EEM would need to be extracted, and the
project's comparative analysis done on a spreadsheet instead of the
within the analysis software itself.  Thanks, but I have a life, wife
and family.

 

4) If this requirement still sounds like a good idea from the comfort of
your tenured office, I say come on out and run couple of dozen real-life
energy code and LEED compliance simulations for me within budget and on
deadline in Q1-Q2 2008 and you'll begin to understand what I'm talking
about.

 

Why not simply allow selecting the orientation closest to, without
performing worse than, the 'average' as the baseline?  This simple
change would allow the baseline numbers to reside within the analysis
software.

 

Alternatively the eQuest developers are rumored to be working on a 90.1
Appendix G compliance module.  Upon release, if it automates the
averaging I may be inclined retire some portion of this diatribe.  

 

Best idea yet, drop this as a requirement, and make it optional where it
makes sense to do so. Utilize by default the far more intuitive (and
useful in terms of energy incentives) 'code minimum' baseline building,
oriented identically to the proposed.  This is the approach I've been
able to convince our state energy code and utility rebate reviewers to
accept -- its just hardened LEED extremists who still seem to have their
head in the sand on this.  

 

 

Regards

Can you not apply various fenestrations and shading to the model without
having to change its orientation? For an existing building, including
LEED EB, what additional benefit could be gained by rotating the model
since you cannot change the orientation?

This is true, however, even with an existing building, you as the
designer/engineer have the option of "working" the facades and applying
appropriate fenestration, shading, etc... you can still make good/bad
decisions and the fact that your footprint is fixed should not give the
design team a waiver from the fact that the sun still rises in the east
and sets in the west.  In fact it may be a benefit if perhaps your
building is shaded on the west by itself.

Here is my question to and response from the USGBC regarding this issue:

  
  
Dear LEED Info, 
  
There has been a lot of chat on this item and I wonder if there is a
USGBC position - I found no reference to this in the CIR's: 
  
Do existing buildings undergoing renovation require the four-point
compass orientation analysis? 
  
  
  
Jeffrey, 
  
If the existing building being renovated is pursuing LEED-NC rather than
LEED-EB, then it would indeed be required to undergo the specified
analysis.  This analysis is used to establish the baseline for energy
performance using the ASHRAE standard.  LEED doesn't have any specific
exemptions for existing buildings in this requirement, but if ASHRAE has
some kind of exemption, we will honor that. 
  
  
So I guess the question then becomes an interpretation of the Appendix G
(Table G3.1 (f)) comment for existing buildings. Rotate or not? 
  
My take has always been that new buildings have the option to consider
orientation but existing buildings cannot be re-oriented so rotating the
model does not really prove anything. 
  
Any 90.1 code committee members or others out there have an
interpretation?

I am not the authority, Keith, but I believe that your interpretation
(that existing buildings do not get rotated in the baseline) is
consistent with the intent of Appendix G.  In new construction, the
decisions regarding building orientation will affect performance and
that performance should be measured against the baseline (although,
there are cases, such as a building that adjoins buildings to either
side, where rotating the baseline through all four orientations does not
make sense).  If you're improving an existing building, the existing
conditions of building enclosure components, including orientation, are
an appropriate baseline.  When we apply Appendix G to existing
buildings, we have also found that "existing building envelopes"
sometimes needs to be parsed into existing building envelope components.
For example, in a mill rehab, the bearing walls may be serviceable and
appropriately modeled "as is" in the baseline, but missing windows or
windows that are clearly not serviceable we model as per the ASHRAE
minimum compliance. 
  
You should note, also, that an addendum to the standard has removed the
provision in the table under G3.1, 5c to distribute windows uniformly in
horizontal bands across the four orientations.  That should make all of
our lives easier.

I am modeling an existing building for Energy & Atmosphere Credit 1:
Optimize Energy Performance. In LEED and table G3.1 No. 5(a) of ASHREA
Standard 90.1-2004, it states that "the baseline building performance
shall be generated by simulating the building with its actual
orientation and again after rotating the entire building 90, 180, 270
degrees, then averaging the results". However table G3.1 No. 5(f) of
ASHREA Standard 90.1-2004 states: "for existing building envelopes, the
baseline building design shall reflect existing conditions prior to any
revisions that are part of the scope of work being evaluated." Would
this mean that you do not need to simulate the building for the four
orientations? It just doesn't seem to make sense to simulate the
building in such a manner if it is existing. I am new energy modeling
for LEED credit and sincerely appreciate any assistance. 
  
Thank you,

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200711301137.AA3719437pd80004176251@gard.com>

I am modeling an ice sheet in a convention center to be used for special
events.  How does one go about scheduling when the ice sheet is to be used
and when not.  In doe-2 documentation, the only schedule I see that may help
is RINK-SETPT-SCH.  This may useful if it was of type ON/OFF/TEMP, but it is
not.  Also there is no schedule for subfloor heating so when would I know
that that is working?

 

So for RINK-SETPT-SCH I use 5deg when I want ice and 50deg when no ice.
Does this mean that subfloor heating continuously runs while setpoint is at
50deg?  Several months out of the year the ice sheet will not be used.
Should scheduling this be done on the zone or equip used?  How does one get
through this scheduling problem?

Here here Brandon. A building is a building and that's that. I have sat
through many charette's  on 'tree hugging' projects to hear how the
buildings orientation can affect the cooling and heating load, let alone
natural daylighting. Only to hear the wise men of 90.1 (who have never
designed a building) to come up with some 'weighted' average to change
the results. The designer ends up doing four different runs only to find
out that the architect didn't have clue what he was trying to do in the
first place.

 

Long live sanity.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] LEED Building Orientation

 

All,

 

The building rotation requirement is utterly nonsensical.  For a
full-text rant on the subject, see my previous post:

 

http://www.gard.com/ml/bldg-sim-archive/msg04038.html 

 

In summary:

 

1) In the case of many new buildings (90% or more I would estimate),
there is very little latitude for changing the orientation.  For example
the main street and therefore the lobby and entryway may be on one side
and one side only of the building, the aspect ratio of the building may
not fit on the lot in two of the four orientations, etc.

 

2) The fictitious, etheral 'averaged' building does not exist even in
the computer code of the best analysis programs we have at our disposal
to date. 

 

3) All baseline numbers for each of the four orientations would need to
be extracted from the analysis software, and averaged on a spreadsheet.
Similarly each and every EEM would need to be extracted, and the
project's comparative analysis done on a spreadsheet instead of the
within the analysis software itself.  Thanks, but I have a life, wife
and family.

 

4) If this requirement still sounds like a good idea from the comfort of
your tenured office, I say come on out and run couple of dozen real-life
energy code and LEED compliance simulations for me within budget and on
deadline in Q1-Q2 2008 and you'll begin to understand what I'm talking
about.

 

Why not simply allow selecting the orientation closest to, without
performing worse than, the 'average' as the baseline?  This simple
change would allow the baseline numbers to reside within the analysis
software.

 

Alternatively the eQuest developers are rumored to be working on a 90.1
Appendix G compliance module.  Upon release, if it automates the
averaging I may be inclined retire some portion of this diatribe.  

 

Best idea yet, drop this as a requirement, and make it optional where it
makes sense to do so. Utilize by default the far more intuitive (and
useful in terms of energy incentives) 'code minimum' baseline building,
oriented identically to the proposed.  This is the approach I've been
able to convince our state energy code and utility rebate reviewers to
accept -- its just hardened LEED extremists who still seem to have their
head in the sand on this.

Can you not apply various fenestrations and shading to the model without
having to change its orientation? For an existing building, including
LEED EB, what additional benefit could be gained by rotating the model
since you cannot change the orientation?

This is true, however, even with an existing building, you as the
designer/engineer have the option of "working" the facades and applying
appropriate fenestration, shading, etc... you can still make good/bad
decisions and the fact that your footprint is fixed should not give the
design team a waiver from the fact that the sun still rises in the east
and sets in the west.  In fact it may be a benefit if perhaps your
building is shaded on the west by itself.

Here is my question to and response from the USGBC regarding this issue:

  
  
Dear LEED Info, 
  
There has been a lot of chat on this item and I wonder if there is a
USGBC position - I found no reference to this in the CIR's: 
  
Do existing buildings undergoing renovation require the four-point
compass orientation analysis? 
  
  
  
Jeffrey, 
  
If the existing building being renovated is pursuing LEED-NC rather than
LEED-EB, then it would indeed be required to undergo the specified
analysis.  This analysis is used to establish the baseline for energy
performance using the ASHRAE standard.  LEED doesn't have any specific
exemptions for existing buildings in this requirement, but if ASHRAE has
some kind of exemption, we will honor that. 
  
  
So I guess the question then becomes an interpretation of the Appendix G
(Table G3.1 (f)) comment for existing buildings. Rotate or not? 
  
My take has always been that new buildings have the option to consider
orientation but existing buildings cannot be re-oriented so rotating the
model does not really prove anything. 
  
Any 90.1 code committee members or others out there have an
interpretation?

I am not the authority, Keith, but I believe that your interpretation
(that existing buildings do not get rotated in the baseline) is
consistent with the intent of Appendix G.  In new construction, the
decisions regarding building orientation will affect performance and
that performance should be measured against the baseline (although,
there are cases, such as a building that adjoins buildings to either
side, where rotating the baseline through all four orientations does not
make sense).  If you're improving an existing building, the existing
conditions of building enclosure components, including orientation, are
an appropriate baseline.  When we apply Appendix G to existing
buildings, we have also found that "existing building envelopes"
sometimes needs to be parsed into existing building envelope components.
For example, in a mill rehab, the bearing walls may be serviceable and
appropriately modeled "as is" in the baseline, but missing windows or
windows that are clearly not serviceable we model as per the ASHRAE
minimum compliance. 
  
You should note, also, that an addendum to the standard has removed the
provision in the table under G3.1, 5c to distribute windows uniformly in
horizontal bands across the four orientations.  That should make all of
our lives easier.

The new addendum r to ASHRAE 90.1 states the following:
a. Orientation. The baseline building performance shall be generated by
simulating the building with its actual orientation and again after rotating
the entire building 90, 180, and 270 degrees, then averaging the results.
The building shall be modeled so that it does not shade itself.

Exceptions

(a) If it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Program Evaluator
that the building orientation is dictated by site considerations. 

(b) Buildings where the vertical fenestration area on each orientation
varies by less than 5%.

 

The USGBC has stated that using the addendums to 90.1 is acceptable when
documenting EAp2 and EAc1.  But be careful, as you'll need to incorporate
the other changes specified by the addendum too.

Can you not apply various fenestrations and shading to the model without
having to change its orientation? For an existing building, including LEED
EB, what additional benefit could be gained by rotating the model since you
cannot change the orientation?

This is true, however, even with an existing building, you as the
designer/engineer have the option of "working" the facades and applying
appropriate fenestration, shading, etc... you can still make good/bad
decisions and the fact that your footprint is fixed should not give the
design team a waiver from the fact that the sun still rises in the east and
sets in the west.  In fact it may be a benefit if perhaps your building is
shaded on the west by itself.

Here is my question to and response from the USGBC regarding this issue: 
  
  
Dear LEED Info, 
  
There has been a lot of chat on this item and I wonder if there is a USGBC
position - I found no reference to this in the CIR's: 
  
Do existing buildings undergoing renovation require the four-point compass
orientation analysis? 
  
  
  
Jeffrey, 
  
If the existing building being renovated is pursuing LEED-NC rather than
LEED-EB, then it would indeed be required to undergo the specified analysis.
This analysis is used to establish the baseline for energy performance using
the ASHRAE standard.  LEED doesn't have any specific exemptions for existing
buildings in this requirement, but if ASHRAE has some kind of exemption, we
will honor that. 
  
  
So I guess the question then becomes an interpretation of the Appendix G
(Table G3.1 (f)) comment for existing buildings. Rotate or not? 
  
My take has always been that new buildings have the option to consider
orientation but existing buildings cannot be re-oriented so rotating the
model does not really prove anything. 
  
Any 90.1 code committee members or others out there have an interpretation?

I am not the authority, Keith, but I believe that your interpretation (that
existing buildings do not get rotated in the baseline) is consistent with
the intent of Appendix G.  In new construction, the decisions regarding
building orientation will affect performance and that performance should be
measured against the baseline (although, there are cases, such as a building
that adjoins buildings to either side, where rotating the baseline through
all four orientations does not make sense).  If you're improving an existing
building, the existing conditions of building enclosure components,
including orientation, are an appropriate baseline.  When we apply Appendix
G to existing buildings, we have also found that "existing building
envelopes" sometimes needs to be parsed into existing building envelope
components.  For example, in a mill rehab, the bearing walls may be
serviceable and appropriately modeled "as is" in the baseline, but missing
windows or windows that are clearly not serviceable we model as per the
ASHRAE minimum compliance. 
  
You should note, also, that an addendum to the standard has removed the
provision in the table under G3.1, 5c to distribute windows uniformly in
horizontal bands across the four orientations.  That should make all of our
lives easier.

I am modeling an existing building for Energy & Atmosphere Credit 1:
Optimize Energy Performance. In LEED and table G3.1 No. 5(a) of ASHREA
Standard 90.1-2004, it states that "the baseline building performance shall
be generated by simulating the building with its actual orientation and
again after rotating the entire building 90, 180, 270 degrees, then
averaging the results". However table G3.1 No. 5(f) of ASHREA Standard
90.1-2004 states: "for existing building envelopes, the baseline building
design shall reflect existing conditions prior to any revisions that are
part of the scope of work being evaluated." Would this mean that you do not
need to simulate the building for the four orientations? It just doesn't
seem to make sense to simulate the building in such a manner if it is
existing. I am new energy modeling for LEED credit and sincerely appreciate
any assistance.

All,
 
The building rotation requirement is utterly nonsensical.  For a
full-text rant on the subject, see my previous post:
 
http://www.gard.com/ml/bldg-sim-archive/msg04038.html 
 
In summary:
 
1) In the case of many new buildings (90% or more I would estimate),
there is very little latitude for changing the orientation.  For example
the main street and therefore the lobby and entryway may be on one side
and one side only of the building, the aspect ratio of the building may
not fit on the lot in two of the four orientations, etc.
 
2) The fictitious, etheral 'averaged' building does not exist even in
the computer code of the best analysis programs we have at our disposal
to date. 
 
3) All baseline numbers for each of the four orientations would need to
be extracted from the analysis software, and averaged on a spreadsheet.
Similarly each and every EEM would need to be extracted, and the
project's comparative analysis done on a spreadsheet instead of the
within the analysis software itself.  Thanks, but I have a life, wife
and family.
 
4) If this requirement still sounds like a good idea from the comfort of
your tenured office, I say come on out and run couple of dozen real-life
energy code and LEED compliance simulations for me within budget and on
deadline in Q1-Q2 2008 and you'll begin to understand what I'm talking
about.
 
Why not simply allow selecting the orientation closest to, without
performing worse than, the 'average' as the baseline?  This simple
change would allow the baseline numbers to reside within the analysis
software.
 
Alternatively the eQuest developers are rumored to be working on a 90.1
Appendix G compliance module.  Upon release, if it automates the
averaging I may be inclined retire some portion of this diatribe.  
 
Best idea yet, drop this as a requirement, and make it optional where it
makes sense to do so. Utilize by default the far more intuitive (and
useful in terms of energy incentives) 'code minimum' baseline building,
oriented identically to the proposed.  This is the approach I've been
able to convince our state energy code and utility rebate reviewers to
accept -- its just hardened LEED extremists who still seem to have their
head in the sand on this.

This is true, however, even with an existing building, you as the
designer/engineer have the option of "working" the facades and applying
appropriate fenestration, shading, etc... you can still make good/bad
decisions and the fact that your footprint is fixed should not give the
design team a waiver from the fact that the sun still rises in the east
and sets in the west.  In fact it may be a benefit if perhaps your
building is shaded on the west by itself.

Here is my question to and response from the USGBC regarding this issue:

 

 

Dear LEED Info,

 

There has been a lot of chat on this item and I wonder if there is a
USGBC position - I found no reference to this in the CIR's:

 

Do existing buildings undergoing renovation require the four-point
compass orientation analysis?

 

 

 

Jeffrey,

 

If the existing building being renovated is pursuing LEED-NC rather than
LEED-EB, then it would indeed be required to undergo the specified
analysis.  This analysis is used to establish the baseline for energy
performance using the ASHRAE standard.  LEED doesn't have any specific
exemptions for existing buildings in this requirement, but if ASHRAE has
some kind of exemption, we will honor that.

 

 

So I guess the question then becomes an interpretation of the Appendix G
(Table G3.1 (f)) comment for existing buildings. Rotate or not?

 

My take has always been that new buildings have the option to consider
orientation but existing buildings cannot be re-oriented so rotating the
model does not really prove anything. 

 

Any 90.1 code committee members or others out there have an
interpretation?

I am not the authority, Keith, but I believe that your interpretation
(that existing buildings do not get rotated in the baseline) is
consistent with the intent of Appendix G.  In new construction, the
decisions regarding building orientation will affect performance and
that performance should be measured against the baseline (although,
there are cases, such as a building that adjoins buildings to either
side, where rotating the baseline through all four orientations does not
make sense).  If you're improving an existing building, the existing
conditions of building enclosure components, including orientation, are
an appropriate baseline.  When we apply Appendix G to existing
buildings, we have also found that "existing building envelopes"
sometimes needs to be parsed into existing building envelope components.
For example, in a mill rehab, the bearing walls may be serviceable and
appropriately modeled "as is" in the baseline, but missing windows or
windows that are clearly not serviceable we model as per the ASHRAE
minimum compliance.

 

You should note, also, that an addendum to the standard has removed the
provision in the table under G3.1, 5c to distribute windows uniformly in
horizontal bands across the four orientations.  That should make all of
our lives easier.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200711291438.AA3840687pd80004165013@gard.com>

Hi,
We are modeling a hospital in San Francisco with add-on Indirect Evap
cooling and humidity controls.  We are leaving all of the Indirect Evap
settings to default (i.e. Evap + Main Cool Coil = Together, Drybulb High
Limit 120 F, Effectiveness = 0.80, etc).  Our results are showing that the
heating energy consumption increases by 32,600 therms and the cooling energy
increases instead of decreasing.

As a test we ran the same building model in Las Vegas with and without
Indirect Evap and found that while the cooling energy decreased
dramatically, the heating energy went up so much that overall the building
wasn't saving energy.

Any thoughts on why the heating energy would increase with the Evaporative
Cooler?  And why it would increase cooling energy in SF?

Thanks!
Kathryn

Seun-

I think John has a point that you might be using too much internal
gains.  Typical guidelines/defaults for internal loads are usually aimed
at solving questions of design loads and not operational consumption
over a period of time.  So check that your plug and lighting loads are
reasonable.  If you're absolutely obsessed with detail, you would use
sub-metering data for lights and equipment to compare the kWh over a
period to the result of your schedules and power density over an
equivalent period.  Alternately, a simple survey (with spot metering) of
equipment draw and estimates of operating schedules should get you close
enough.  

 

One thing that has been missing from the discussion is infiltration.
This could well be the most significant variable - especially in your
heating climate.  It is generally ignored in simulations and most
engineering calculations because it is a real bugaboo - very difficult
to define.  But it may be possible to "bracket" the infiltration.  There
are a couple of ways that you could estimate or assess the infiltration
performance of the actual building.  Tracer gas testing could give you a
quantitative measure of actual air changes under the conditions of the
test.  The difficulty in this method is translating the results of the
test under the specific test conditions to estimates of what might
happen under other conditions.  To use tracer gas infiltration data in
the model, you would use an infiltration method that responds to outdoor
temperature and, probably wind, and then determine what values for other
parameters are needed in DOE2 to arrive at a similar calculation of
infiltration (or air changes) in the simulation under simulation weather
conditions that correspond to those of the test.  

Perhaps a simpler method would be to use fan pressurization testing to
estimate the leakage characteristics of the building enclosure.  You can
then give DOE2 corresponding inputs describing the leakage
characteristics of the building enclosure (whether the algorithms within
DOE2 will produce reasonably accurate estimates of infiltration from
these is another story.)

Lastly, you could do what some un-named parties in the building modeling
world advocate and just adjust the infiltration lever in the model until
the model results match the measured results.   

 

All in all, having been tied to a chair doing DOE2 runs in a windowless
basement lab as a graduate student myself, I think it worthwhile to pass
along wisdom that a very pragmatic engineer offered to me: "The model is
a representation of reality.  It is not reality."  In other words, the
model is only a mathematical representation of what is happening
thermodynamically within the building.  

Or, in the immortal line from Monty Python's "The Holy Grail" (King
Arthur's page) "It's only a model."

Best regards,

Ken

Hello,

My name is Seun Odukomaiya. I am a graduate student at Purdue University
working on the Building Sciences. As part of my research, I am trying to
calibrate an eQuest model to match the energy performance of an actual
building for which i have data. Currently, I am having difficulties with
the electric heating element. The actual building (and thus the model)
utilizes an electric heating element. The energy data from the model,
however, is much lower than that of the actual building. I have tried
several things, but have been unsuccessful in increasing the energy
consumption of the electric heating element in my eQuest model. I need
to increase the energy consumption of the electric heating element in my
eQuest model to get it to match the data from the actual building. Any
help in ways to accomplish this within eQuest would be so greatly
appreciated. Thank you in advance.

Just remember input units divided by same output units and you are set,
for both EIR and HIR.

 

COP and EER (or "typical" units of kW/ton for chillers) are steady state
terms, these would reflect the performance at any point in time, and
correlate to the EIR and HIR model inputs if you are using the equipment
selection point conditions.  Just convert units and take the reciprocal
as necessary.  EIR is the inverse of COP as you mentioned.

 

SEER (and IPLV/NPLV) represent seasonal averages, ideally you will be
calculating this with the model rather than using it as an input.  (It
can be used as a QA check.)  The seasonal performance for your building
probably won't be identical to the conditions used to generate that
weighted equation, so the equipment selection values would be best. 

 

Hopefully you can find a cut sheet for the equipment somewhere to find
the power and capacity values rather than using the SEER.  The
correction equation you referenced is valid under certain conditions -
maybe your project is a match.  I wouldn't use it to select between
different packaged units, but it might be close enough to compare a
packaged unit with a chiller system.  Depends why you are simulating the
project.

 

Hope this helps!

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] equest - select eir & hir questions

 

I need to be schooled in electric input ratio and heat input ratio for
all equipment types: Airside and waterside.

 

Airside - packaged units:  Where does one find a COP for a DX cooling
unit?  I have only seen SEER or EER.  Then I have seen this equation
from archive files, 

Cooling EIR = 0.941 * (1/(SEER/3.413)).  Is this the correct equation?
It was taken from the link:
http://www.gard.com/ml/bldg-sim-archive/msg01626.html.

How about conversion of EER to SEER?  I think I understand HIR = btu
input/btu output?

 

Waterside - chillers:  chiller EIR = 1/ COP, I was also told EIR =
chiller kW *3413 / capacity.  Is this the same, which is correct?

HIR = heat input/ cooling capacity.  Isn't COP the Output / input? So
wouldn't HIR be 1/ COP then.  This is quite confusing and going nowhere
for me, would someone please clarify.

OK, these questions may seem fundamental for some people and if they are
then I should get the answers and clarification I am looking for:

1.	It used to be a common thought that laboratory systems were
process systems and therefore exempt from anyT-24 compliance and for
that matter 90.1, this doesn't seem to be the case as T-24 classes
Laboratories under the CBC definition as occupancy B and therefore must
comply. But what about the process loads, there doesn't seem to be any
clear direction here, so we include them when the don't affect the
results and leave them out when the affect the results (who says
Engineers don't think outside of the box).
2.	90.1, or at least the parts I read does not clearly state how
laboratory systems and process loads are to be simulated.

 

Please help guide a poor engineer through melee of confusion, thanks

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200711290847.AA4700156pd80004154068@gard.com>

I have an air-to-air electric heat pump with a gas powered duct furnace.
Is there anyway to accurately account for this in the eQuest wizard?
(I'm still in preliminary stages of project) 
 
This is what I tried.  I entered the system as a split system single
zone heat pump with air as the source.  But when I entered the heating
capacity and efficiency I entered it as an effective value factoring in
both the heat pump heating and duct furnace.  Htg Capacity= Heat Pump
Cap + Duct Furnace Cap, Htg Efficiency = (HP Cap * COP + DF Cap *
Efficiency of DF)/Htg Capacity
 
One thing that I'm worried about is that I'm eliminating the consumption
of gas, and thus may be skewing my savings.  Does anyone have
suggestions?
 
One other thing that I had a question about is if what I did is
acceptable, then should I use an all electric baseline HVAC or keep the
fossil fuel type system, even though I'm not actually modeling any gas
use.
 
Thanks

Hello,

Has anybody got any information or experience on optimised constructions 
for the middle east?

What is the best general approach to thermal mass and insulation? The 
building's in question are likely to have full environmental control. 
Summer DB is in excess of 46degC.

Thick (690mm) concrete walls will be employed. Preliminary constructions 
mooted so far have internal insulation. Is this the best approach?

Many thanks

Chris Yates

Steve---

I didn't know the answer to your first question initially, but knew the second part which ended up solving the first (if that makes any sense).

So second question first, the easiest way to input an exterior lighting load for say a parking lot is by creating an exterior direct load in the Utility and Economics tab in the Detailed Edit mode.  Double click on your electric meter (most likely EM1) and you can create interior or exterior direct loads with their own schedules.  

In checking out this tab, I realized that if you input an exterior lighting load (W/sf) in the wizard, it shows up here in kW with the Exterior Lighting Schedule brought in from the wizard.  This kW value corresponds to the entered W/sf times the shell floor area not the wall area.

So I hope that answers your questions...I know I learned something in the process.

I'm working with eQuest to model a single story office building in Miami,
FL.  This is for LEED certification. I'm having difficulty entering
information regarding exterior lighting loads into the model.  I'm new to
DOE2 and the eQuest front-end, so I do most of my work through the wizards
and input screens (haven't edited any text files yet -- I'm sure I'll get
there one day).

Can anyone shed light on:

*Screen 23 of 25, Exterior Lighting Loads and Profiles under the DD shell
wizard, allows the user to input a W/ft^2 for "Exterior Lighting Load".
Question: what square footage are they referencing? I can't find an
explanation anywhere in the documentation. Are they talking about total
vertical plane surface area (i.e. building exterior)?

*Assuming the above number is referencing building surface area (minus roof,
I presume), is there an ideal way to enter the total parking lot watts?  I
could always add it to the above number, I guess, if I knew where DOE2 was
going for the square footage.

Any insight would be greatly appreciated.

Michael,

Back-checking my notes from the eQUEST training class, it notes to check
BEPS and BEPU for "Hours Outside Throttling Range", followed by SS-R,
SS-F (only logs during fan run hours) and SS-O (report includes only fan
run hours). As noted in the different reports (in my notes), they only
report during fan run hours, so I believe the night cycling is
considered an unoccupied time and is not included in these reports.

Using eQuest, I am working on a building model with a VAV system with
fans cycling on at night to meet setback temperatures. The SS-C report
indicates about 1,500 annual  hours of night cycling. If I change the
Night-Cycle-Control from Cycle-On-Any to Stay-Off,  the 1,500 hours of
night cycling disappears as expected. However, there is no difference in
the number of hours of loads not met either in the BEPS report or the

The issue I have is that I expect to get an increase in loads not met when I change from enabling fans to cycle on to meet night setback to disabling night cycling (especially since I am showing a significant number of hours that fans are cycling on when allowed to do so). However, you may have answered my question indirectly. In Trace an unmet load hour can only occur during occupied periods. Does anyone know if this is also true in DOE2.2? Unmet loads during setback operation do not count toward unmet load hours?

Michael,

I don't have a lot of experience with unmet load hours in Equest, but do in
Trane Trace. An unmet load hour is any hour in which the building is
occupied (above a certain percentage- in Trace its 5%) and the space
temperature is more than 1.5 degrees colder (in heating) or warmer (in
cooling).

I would first try removing your thermostat setback and see if that solves
your problem.  If it does, your building is not getting back up to the
occupied thermostat temperature quick enough before it becomes occupied
causing unmet load hours.  How aggressive is your setback?

You can also try operating your fans at least 1 hour before occupancy.

Your system may also be undersized (if it's heating unmet load hours) and
the lack of internal gains during the night hours trigger unmet load hours
because the system can't keep up.

Use the output to give you a clue to which space(s) are causing the
problems.  Good luck!

-Jon

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Night Cycling Fans and Loads Not Met

Using eQuest, I am working on a building model with a VAV system with fans
cycling on at night to meet setback temperatures. The SS-C report indicates
about 1,500 annual  hours of night cycling. If I change the
Night-Cycle-Control from Cycle-On-Any to Stay-Off,  the 1,500 hours of night
cycling disappears as expected. However, there is no difference in the
number of hours of loads not met either in the BEPS report or the SS-R
report. Anyone have an explanation?

Michael,

Back-checking my notes from the eQUEST training class, it notes to check
BEPS and BEPU for "Hours Outside Throttling Range", followed by SS-R,
SS-F (only logs during fan run hours) and SS-O (report includes only fan
run hours). As noted in the different reports (in my notes), they only
report during fan run hours, so I believe the night cycling is
considered an unoccupied time and is not included in these reports.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200711281230.AA3016890pd80004141663@gard.com>

Our team is modeling various energy recovery and preconditioning schemes
for a 100%OA hospital campus. The simulation results for both our CV and
VAV systems are unexpected as we change between different energy
recovery/preconditioning strategies. I would REALLY appreciate any
insight you could provide toward explaining the results below. 

Our energy recovery schemes are "Sensible HX" (runaround coil or
air-to-air plate & frame HX) with "Mixed Air Reset" temperature control
accomplished by the "Modulate HX" strategy. The preconditioner is
indirect evaporation operating together with the main coil (and all
other default settings).

1) Runs without energy recovery or preconditioning are outperforming
runs that include these strategies overall.

2) Energy recovery is increasing fan energy (expected - though perhaps
not as big a difference was expected), increasing cooling energy
slightly (unexpected with mixed air reset control), and decreasing
heating energy (expected). The fan energy increase offsets any or all
improvements on the heating side.

3) Indirect evap preconditioning is only slightly improving or in some
cases increasing cooling energy (unexpected) and increasing heating
energy (unexpected).

Thank you for your help! We are working hard to issue some results
regarding these strategies soon.

Taylor

Folks:

I'm not an architect, so only can speculate on the answer.

I am simulating an multi faceted angled(peaked)roof generated by the
eQuest Wizard (and looks pretty good in the 3-D rendering !!).

Now I add a cool roof membrane to it (in Detailed Interface Parametric
mode). Does DOE-2 KNOW what the angle is of each roof segment, such that
a "high noon" sun does NOT drop a direct normal solar beam onto a
vertical surface (which of course it is not)?

Ideas?

Is anyone interested in forming a local "bldg-sim" group in Chicago?
Just wondering if there are any like-minded souls out there that may be
members of ibpsa or AEE, maybe we can organize within those groups, or
have one meeting of the local ASHRAE, AEE or USGBC chapters devoted to
simulation topics?

I'm not completely sure what this might entail, just a crazy idea that I
had.  Anyone else do this on a local level?  Maybe the Portland folks?

Let me know if you might be interested.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200711271346.AA4628625pd80004135106@gard.com>

I am modeling an existing building for Energy & Atmosphere Credit 1:
Optimize Energy Performance. In LEED and table G3.1 No. 5(a) of ASHREA
Standard 90.1-2004, it states that "the baseline building performance
shall be generated by simulating the building with its actual
orientation and again after rotating the entire building 90, 180, 270
degrees, then averaging the results". However table G3.1 No. 5(f) of
ASHREA Standard 90.1-2004 states: "for existing building envelopes, the
baseline building design shall reflect existing conditions prior to any
revisions that are part of the scope of work being evaluated." Would
this mean that you do not need to simulate the building for the four
orientations? It just doesn't seem to make sense to simulate the
building in such a manner if it is existing. I am new energy modeling
for LEED credit and sincerely appreciate any assistance.

 

Thank you,

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] calibrating the building simulation tool

 

Hi

I am working on simulation of traditional buildings here in India for
study of thermal comfort. I am using Design Builder and Energy Plus for
this. I want to know about what can be done to calibrate the results
obtained by the simulation tool.

Is anyone interested in forming a local "bldg-sim" group in Chicago?
Just wondering if there are any like-minded souls out there that may be
members of ibpsa or AEE, maybe we can organize within those groups, or
have one meeting of the local ASHRAE, AEE or USGBC chapters devoted to
simulation topics?

I'm not completely sure what this might entail, just a crazy idea that I
had.  Anyone else do this on a local level?  Maybe the Portland folks?

Let me know if you might be interested.

I am modeling a 5 story multifamily residential building located n Rhode
Island in the wizard of eQuest. I am comparing a heat pump system versus
a fan coil system. When I simulate the fan coil system I am seeing an
unexpected cooling load in the winter months (Nov - Feb). However, there
is not a cooling load for these months with my heat pump system. Both
runs are identical with the exception of the HVAC systems. Any ideas or

Hello,

My name is Seun Odukomaiya. I am a graduate student at Purdue University working on the Building Sciences. As part of my research, I am trying to calibrate an eQuest model to match the energy performance of an actual building for which i have data. Currently, I am having difficulties with the electric heating element. The actual building (and thus the model) utilizes an electric heating element. The energy data from the model, however, is much lower than that of the actual building. I have tried several things, but have been unsuccessful in increasing the energy consumption of the electric heating element in my eQuest model. I need to increase the energy consumption of the electric heating element in my eQuest model to get it to match the data from the actual building. Any help in ways to accomplish this within eQuest would be so greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.

Mr. Tian:

 

I believe you need to change the heating water supply temperature in the
heating loop attached to the heat pump chiller system to 130F or lower.
This is pretty much a limitation of an actual chiller used in a heat
pump configuration that this model simulates. The refrigerant
temperature in a typical chiller condenser isn't hot enough to raise the
condenser water temperature to any warmer than this. In my experience,
even 130F is pushing it.

	Dear all,
	
	I tried to setup a loop-to-loop heat-pump system. I used the

file, I got the following error report: "HW design temperature too hight

	In the detailed simulation file, I got the error: "chiller 1 has

	Does someone have an idea what is the problem with the

Some things of the top of my head:

-try to find out the actual occupancies, lighting and equipment power
densities (if you don't know them use ASHRAE values)
-make sure you are using the correct reheat delta T
-correct heat recovery effectiveness
-as mentioned earlier, check the thermo setpt temps and the setbacks.  also
make sure you are taking into account the time when the school is on break.
-in addition to the OA% make sure you are supplying the correct amount of
makeup air as well. (again if you don't know them refer to ASHRAE for
minimum air flow rates)
-im assuming you have the actual drawings, but if you don't make sure you
inputted the correct external wall and the glazing performance values.

Good luck,

Guys,

I am overwhelmed with the response to my post about needing help with an
eQuest calibration. I can't tell you how much I appreciate all your
willingness to help. I will try some of the things that were suggested. In
the mean time, here is some more information about my eQuest model:

 

Location: Indianapolis, Indiana

Air-Side HVAC: Single-Zone Reheat with chilled water coil, electric heating
coil, and heat recovery

Water-Side HVAC: Chilled water loop with screw compressor

 

It is my understanding that with a reheat system, the cooling coil is
supposed to overcool the incoming air to achieve the needed
dehumidification. When this happens, the heating coil is then supposed to
reheat the temperature back up to the zone setpoint. Is this correct? If
this is the case, shouldn't the heating coil have to do more work? My
humidity setpoint is 45% RH. Also, is there a different way to model a steam
humidifier in eQuest besides the "humidistat" option. It seems limited in
terms of input parameters.

 

I have matched the model's heating element capacity (kW) to that of the
actual building. I will try some of your suggestions, such as decreasing
internal loads, and increasing outside air %. Again, thank you so much, and
I will keep you posted on any progress

Seun,

Not knowing exactly what kind of system you are using, I can still try to make a few suggestions on what you can do to increase your heating energy.  Is your envelope modeled correctly...right insulation if there is any, windows, etc.?  Check your outside air numbers...increasing the cfm/person if needed can raise your heating energy.  As John mentioned, check your internal loads...maybe you are generating too much heat inside the building.  Check your heating schedule...is your setback temperature too low?

These are a few things to start with.  But you should post all of the details of your building (including location) and someone can help you figure it out.

Cheers,
Andrew

Seun:

I am a University of Illinois graduate, but will
gladly help a fellow Big Ten engineer.

You need to tell BLDG-SIM what type of system you
have, as all heating is not the same. You also didn't
mention if your building is also cooled, or where in
the world you are using for weather.

Is it also possible you are giving the building too
much internal load, which is heating the building
versus using the electric heat?

Please response with answers to these questions, and I
am sure the gurus on this site can assist you.

Go Illini !!

If four-pipe fan coils are used, with fan energy turned off (or down,
to mimic circulator energy), then fan power for ventilation air is not
included.  I have two ideas:

1.  Specify an energy recovery ventilator, with effectiveness of 0%,
and appropriate pressure drops to account for ventilation air fan
power.  I have not tried this, but it might work

2.  Use an airside system, and model radiators in the space.  Remember
to input the panel capacity at the room level!  Adjust the dT and
pressure drop to simulate the radiant floor.  Also, as mentioned
before, lower the setpoint temperature to 68F.  Depending on the
radiant floor system used, you might want to include thermal mass in
the space.  This method allows you to use whatever cooling method and
OA handling method you choose.

If anyone tries #1, let me know!

In eQUEST, you can define humidification by setting the minimum
humidity keyword in the system.  Is there a way to add this load to a
steam loop separate from the hot water heating loop?  So far, I have
only been able to combine them whereas in reality, my building has
steam boilers for humidification and hot water boilers for hydronic

Hello,

Does anyone on the list have experience with the Florida Solar Energy

Your leaving air temp is 45 DegF? Sounds COLD. I had the same error, and
don't have a solution. But what I DID do was raise the LAT 1 DegF. Then
it work. No idea why the error occurred.

must be at least 6F higher than the EWT. My delta T is only 3F and

This is the error I have been getting in eQuest:

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200711211037.AA3755359pd80004111936@gard.com>

The way I would do it is to use the OA-FROM-SYSTEM keyword and add the
ERU as a separate system with ventilation heat recovery.  In this way,
you can define the heat recovery and power and flow characteristics of
the ERU explicitly.  

 

I usually do this by first creating a very small (1 sq-ft) dummy
space, then a dummy thermal zone for that space.  Then, create the ERU
as a 100% OA constant volume system serving that thermal zone.  Now
comes the fun part.  You close eQUEST, open the .inp with a text
editor and cut the new system and all its keywords from the bottom of
the list of systems and paste it to the top of the system list.  If
you don't do this, when you run the simulation, it will complain that
the OA-FROM-SYSTEM system referenced does not precede the current
system and will abort the sim.  Now, reopen eQUEST and in your 6
systems, use the OA-FROM-SYSTEM keyword on the system, OA tab to
define that the ventilation air is coming from your ERU.  

 

Hope this helps.

Dear all,

I also tried several buildings. When added ceiling, then the heat flow

In version 3.61 and earlier the eQUEST wizards do not have an option for

DX AHU with PIU zone boxes.  However, in the detail mode, if a PIU system
has

been defined you can open the AHU property sheet, go to the cooling tab
and

on the coil Cap/Control subtab change the Cool Source from chilled water
to

Electric DX.  You should then set to default any CHW loop connection and

related values (lower in that column on the subtab) and then you can
delete

the chiller(s), cooling tower(s) and CHW loop (in that order) if no longer

used.

 

In the next release (3.62) DX cooling for PIU AHUs will also available in
the wizards.

I would like to discuss question number 1 as well.  Appendix G specifies
that Direct Expansion be used as the cooling type for System 6.  However,
the PIU system in eQuest does not allow you to use DX coils.  I have seen
several archived posts on this same question that say to model a chiller
equivalent to the DX coils, but nothing further.  I have redefined the
chiller performance curves accordingly with no success.  Has anyone set up
this system succesfully in eQuest?  

 

In response to Questions 2 and 3, the U-value and Shading Coefficient of
the glass has significant impact on the energy savings with the HVAC
system.  In addition, the visible light transmittance of the glass
directly impacts the Daylighting controls within the rooms affecting
electric usage.  The selection of glass should be investigated when
determining the window-wall ratio and the resulting savings.

1.	How do you use system 6 in eQUEST? Do you have to use parallel PIU

2.	At what percentage of window to wall ratio that high efficiency

3.	At what number is considered significant saving? 

Any respond is greatly appreciated.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] add ceiling in eQUEST
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200711201648.AA4833296pd80004108297@gard.com>

Dear all,

When I model a one-floor building in eQUEST, I found that adding the "lay-in acoustic tile" ceiling (no insulation added) will cause the peak load through roof to zero. When eliminate the ceiling, a large part of the building heat flow will go through the roof.

I also tried several buildings. When added ceiling, then the heat flow through roof turns to zero. Does anyone have an idea why this happens? 

Thanks a lot.

Regards,

David

Karen,

Chapter 11 of ASHRAE 90.1-2004 and Appendix G do not allow any credit for
reduced infiltration in commercial buildings.  
It is my understanding that there isn't enough data to form a consensus on
what the baseline would/should be.  Not to mention the challenge of blower
door testing a large commercial project and getting consistent results..  

If you look at the Residential Systems Approach in the IECC 2006 you will
see that there is a method for claiming credit for reduced infiltration on
residential projects.  The baseline they establish is based on Normalized
Leakage of .57 and the weather factor W for the project site from ASHRAE
Standard 136.  IECC does not allow credit for infiltration rates lower than
0.35 ACH.

Hello again,

I'm modeling a couple projects, one currently under LEED 2.1 (ECB) and a few
under LEED 2.2 (Appendix G).  To date, I have not seen any mention of
infiltration.  If the envelope is tested, can credit be taken for reduced
infiltration in the proposed design?  If so, what's the baseline?  For
renovated buildings can a pre-construction blower door test be the baseline?

Thanks!

If four-pipe fan coils are used, with fan energy turned off (or down,
to mimic circulator energy), then fan power for ventilation air is not
included.  I have two ideas:

1.  Specify an energy recovery ventilator, with effectiveness of 0%,
and appropriate pressure drops to account for ventilation air fan
power.  I have not tried this, but it might work

2.  Use an airside system, and model radiators in the space.  Remember
to input the panel capacity at the room level!  Adjust the dT and
pressure drop to simulate the radiant floor.  Also, as mentioned
before, lower the setpoint temperature to 68F.  Depending on the
radiant floor system used, you might want to include thermal mass in
the space.  This method allows you to use whatever cooling method and
OA handling method you choose.

If anyone tries #1, let me know!

Radiant Slabs in eQUEST and LEEDIn most of the projects that we have dealt with in the Pacific Northwest, where there has been no cooling proposed and hence no chiller in the central plant and the air handler includes only hot water coils to tamper the outside air for ventilation. In these situations, I have modeled a hydronic radiant floor heating using a Unit Ventilator, by setting the fan power kw/cfm as 0.0000 and including a baseboard at the zone level. 

Moreover, as per LEED protocol one has to model cooling even when no cooling has been proposed, i create a dummy zone and assign a PSZ system with DX coils and hot water coils and then in the outside air tab of the Unit Ventilator select the PSZ system from the drop down list in 'Outside Air from System'. 

Since an FPH system doesn't allow outside air to be simulated, would require some work around to account for the outside air loads (which would be minimum ventilation required for IAQ) on the zone with radiant floor heating. However, the approach described above takes into account the outside air loads and also includes a cooling system that is similar to the baseline system in most cases (PSZ-AC with DX coils for cooling). In case, the central plant includes a chiller and/or baseline system includes chilled water coils, I would use the Four Pipe FC.

Any thoughts on this approach?


Thanks.

  I'm doing an ECB documentation for a LEED 2.1 project using eQUEST. Around half of the building uses hydronic radiant floor heating. I am trying to model this in eQUEST. 

  From past threads, suggestions I have come across are: 
  1. Lower the Space temperature to 68F. 
  2. Using the FPH system in eQUEST. This doesn't allow for cooling however, and uses no fans (we still have air supply in our building). 

  3. Andrew Craig suggested inputting the capacity of the radiant system as an internal energy source. (This is great because it allows the fans to cycle on/off and maintains the cooling side. It doesn't calculate heating loads on the radiant slab though)

  What I plan to do is use the FPH system and setback the thermostat to 68F in these spaces. This will allow me to calculate the heating energy on the radiant coil. I then plan to use Andrew's "internal energy source" method to calculate the airside system loads, and add the FPH heat load to that. 

  Does this seem like a reasonable method to model this?

I need some direction.  I'm trying to model a water side economizer
which utilizes cooling tower water to precondition supply air with out a
chiller.  Has anyone done this before?  Is it as simple as setting
WS-ECONO= YES?  I've heard it's possible to model a DOA system setting
up a "dummy" space in eQUEST and placing the resulting .inp file in the
.inp file of the building you are trying to mode.  Is this something
that requires modification of the .inp file by adding a HEAT-EXCHANGER
with TYPE=CROSSFLOW-SUP-MIXED and use the CW loop as the supply or the
like? 

Thanks for the help in advance.

Why not run the system as four pipe fan coil and remove the fan power.
The system should maintain the required space temperatures. The
capacities of the fan coil unit are then the heating and cooling
capacities of the radiant slab. Assuming the slab is only used for
convective heating and cooling. If you want to look at radiation energy
exchange you will need another program.

 

Good luck.

Taylor,
 
On pages 431-432 of the DOE2.2 Vol. 2 Dictionary manual, under the definition for the keyword OUTSIDE-AIR-FLOW, is in part the following statement:
 
"... Note that specifying outside ventilation air at the zone level takes precedence over specifying it at the system level."
 
This has tripped me up more than once... basically it's saying be sure to remove all outside air assignments at the zone level, either per person or per square foot, else whatever you do at the system level is ignored.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] eQuest 100% OA


I am modeling a 100% OA system for a hospital to compare the energy usage of constant volume and variable volume. I have entered in the appropriate OA minimum air change rates specified by code and am currently using the "Variable Air Volume" system type to model both systems. The only change that I am making between the two systems is the Min-Flow-Ratio; for CV it is set to 1.0 and for VAV it is set to 0.2 (we are using high turndown Phoenix valves). 
 
Our results are showing that the system is recirculating air. We have set OA economizer control as "fixed fraction" and 1.0 and have created a "min-air-sch" for ventilation air that is always set at 1.0. We have also tried setting the economizer control as "drybulb" and setting the boundary conditions to 100?F and 20?F. 
 
Do you have any suggestions regarding how to prevent recirculation? We still need to be able to define OA minimums for code compliance.
 
Thanks for the help.

We just completed a project with KONE's high efficiency elevator system.
We assumed hydraulic to be the baseline, and the KONE traction elevators
to be the EEM.  KONE has their own software where they ran the analysis
for us for both system types.  They provided the baseline and EEM energy
usuage (kW) of both elevator systems.  We plugged these values into
eQUEST as a direct load to the electric utility meter and used the
elevator default schedule in the eQUEST library.  
 
This project is going for LEED and we'll see if this methodology works
for USGBC.

There was some discussion on this group about elelvators awhile back, so you should check the archives.  Also, one other signigicant (and often difficult) issue to consider:  What is the true "baseline" for the application that you are considering?  There are a variety of elevator technologies out there, and the one that you are considering as the energy efficient technology may already in fact be considered standard practice for that application.

Someone most surely has, but unfortunately, USGBC has ignored this text on page G-8 of the 90.1-2004 Users Manual:
 
"3. Provide instructions for the
exceptional method, so that other
users may apply it consistently and
fairly in future rating method
applications. Once approved, the
exceptional calculation method will
become, in effect, an amendment to
the rating method."

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200711161723.AA2300984pd80004085577@gard.com>

Does anyone have experience using the exceptional calculation method (ASHRAE
90.1 Appendix G Section G2.5) to justify traction elevators as an efficiency
improvement over hydraulic elevators?

I searched the LEED CIR rulings and didn't find much on the exceptional
calculation method or changing the process load for elevator upgrades.
(Appendix G Table G3.1 line 12 says that the elevator load must stay the
same).

Thanks!

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200711161619.AA1941796pd80004084411@gard.com>

Happy Friday Afternoon!

 

After spending some time reviewing my model output report, I am stuck on
ways to improve the heat addition rate (found on page SV-A).  I have
tried manipulating the coil heating capacity and various fan parameters
but can't seem to improve the capacity: addition ratio any higher than
roughly 50%.  Is this a standard ratio for my system type (PVAV) or are
there other parameters that I should look to improve (such manipulating
the capacity curves) to boost my overall system heat transfer
efficiency?

 

I'd appreciate any input or thoughts!

Steve,

For reference, ASHRAE 90.1-2004, Appendix G (Performance Rating Method)
allows by default a 10% reduction (see Table G3.2 for qualifiers) in
lighting power density for areas that incorporate occupancy sensor
control of lighting.  Note that the Standard does mandate automatic
lighting controls for certain spaces (classrooms, conference/meeting
rooms, lunch/break rooms), so no credit is allowed for these areas.
Alternatively, the Standard can still be met by altering the schedules
if "credible technical documentation for the modifications are
provided".

If this is a LEED project then the above gudelines should be followed,
otherwise they do serve as a defensible rationale for dealing with
occupancy sensor controls.

Steve,
 
You didn't say whether you were modeling an ASHRAE 90.1 or LEED project. If
so automatic lighting shutoff controls are a mandatory requirement for areas
not operated 24/7 according to Sec. 9.4.1. If you provide occupancy sensors
for zone level control you can show savings for occupancy sensors according
to Table G3.2 in Appendix G. Methods allowed include reduction of the
connected LPD or a reduction in the hourly lighting schedules.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200711161124.AA2422187pd80004079714@gard.com>

Hello again,

I have another appendix G question:  The building I'm modeling uses
geothermal heat pumps for 3 zones, and steam baseboard heat for the
other 20 or so other zones and is 2 floors.  This puts me at Type 3
for the baseline heating system (PSZ-AC).  The heating method for this
system is listed as a Furnace, but according to G.3.1.1.1 Purchased
Heat: "For systems using purchased hot water or steam, hot water or
steam costs shall be based on actual utility rates, and on-site
boilers shall not be modeled in the baseline building design."

Any thoughts on what the baseline system should be?  I'm thinking
steam coils using the purchased steam, any thoughts?

Thanks again for all the help.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200711160023.AA2314421pd80004078444@gard.com>

John:

Have been involved in the Geothermal Heat Pump (GHP) industry for about 8 years, I think I can understand your feeling and want to share with you some information and my personal opinion about Geothermal heat pump.

First, different from TRANE who have broad product lines, there are several manufacturers in the US who are dedicated in producing water-source and geothermal heat pumps, including ClimateMaster (www.climatemaster.com), Water Furnace (http://waterfurnace.com), and Florida Heat Pump (http://www.fhp-mfg.com/). I believe you can get engineering level information about GHP from any of these companies. In addition, there are also lots of information about GHP, including engineering manual and list of certified designer/driller,  available at International Ground Source Heat Pump Association (http://www.igshpa.okstate.edu/). More information of GHP related research, incentives, contractors, tools, and case studies have been collected and available through the website of Geothermal Heat Pump Consortium (http://www.geoexchange.org/).

Second, eQUEST/DOE-2.2 has been enhanced in the GHP system simulation since version 3.6 (http://doe2.com/download/DOE-22/DOE22Vol6-NewFeatures_44e2.pdf). Different from Trace, eQUEST/DOE-2.2 actually simulates the performance of various ground heat exchanger using an advanced and widely accepted algorithm. It can predict the long term performance of GHP systems, which is critical in designing GHP for buildings with unbalanced cooling and heating loads. As an add-on feature, a performance data/curve library of water-to-air heat pump can be installed and accessed directly from eQUEST wizard interface (http://www.climatemaster.com/index/equest). 

Third, I believe the reason TRANE stop producing GHP products is not because of GHP technology itself but the overwhelming obstacles in the market. Just as you described, the practitioners in the HVAC industry are not motivated to try "new" technology, especially when energy is cheap. 

BUT, in my opinion, the cheap energy has its hidden price and the cheap energy era may be gone forever. Listen to the news about climate change and global warming, look at the climbing oil price, feel the suffering of our mother nature... We know we need make some change to make our world sustainable. If, previously, the goal of HVAC design is to size equipment large enough for the peak loads, today's goal of the HVAC design should be providing comfort built environment in the most energy efficient way and with least impact on our environment. Sizing an equipment to meet the peak loads can be done with just some "rule of thumb", but it is much more challenging to design the most energy efficient system. It requires comprehensive knowledge of the building, occupants, and HVAC systems. In most cases, we have to rely on sophisticated computer program to facilitate the design. However, look at the tremendous changes in our world, shouldn't we, practitioners in HVAC industry, also make some change in our work? As Terry E. Townsend, the former president of ASHRAE, addressed: "A sustainable future (is) the ASHRAE promise".

GHP, the proven most energy efficient way to condition our living space, should be given more attention, support, and credits. The GHP industry are willing to and working hard to help practitioners overcome the obstacles in the design and implementation of GHP.

I agree that the App. G fan power and PLR curves are only for Baseline fans.
 
A few other comments related to your ?s:
 
1. Table G3.1, No. 1(b) says that "all *conditioned* spaces in the proposed design shall be simulated as being both heated and cooled even if no heating or cooling system is to be installed..." [emphasis mine].  I wonder if what you're describing would be considered a "semi-heated" area instead of "conditioned."  If it is semi-heated, C5.2 gives the guidelines that both baseline and proposed should be heated only and have 50F setpoints.  Of course, the PRM doesn't specify App. C....  This is most likely intended for garages, warehouses, etc., though.  If your building has office spaces where people will want to maintain more comfortable temperatures, then I would say to call it "conditioned" and model it as heated and cooled as G3.1, 1(b) says.  Just something to think about.
 
2. As far as how many systems to model, here is what I think.  Addendum U to G3.1.1 says that for systems 1-4, each thermal block will have its own system.  For systems 5-8, each floor should have its own system.  The main exception would be spaces that have significantly different internal gains or schedules - they are supposed to be modeled separately as either system 3 or 4 (depending on heat source).  So unless you have a bunch of these different spaces (like an auditorium, pool, cafeteria, etc.), your baseline should include only one system per thermal zone for 1-4 or per floor for 5-8.  For your proposed model, it should include the exact same systems as shown in the proposed design drawings.
 
3. You might want to use Addendum ac for the latest way (that I know of) to calculate baseline fan power.  If this is for a LEED project, the USGBC issued something back in April saying it was OK to use addenda to App. G.
 
4. Table G3.1, No. 4, Exception (a) says that if you are only including heating or cooling to comply with App. G, then you can let the fans cycle on/off during occupied hours during this mode (in your case, during cooling mode).  This will affect your fan energy.
 
If anyone has any comments or updates to what I wrote above, let me know!

I've interpreted Appendix G that they fan sizing is for the baseline
building only; use actual fan sizes for the proposed building.

The fan sizing run should only apply to the 8 predefined system options
in Appendix G for your building type.  So, if you're taking one of these
defined systems that applies to your building and modeling it on each of
your proposed spaces, you would have to do a sizing run for each system.
The sizing run should be at the HVAC system level.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Appendix G Supply Fan Power

Hi All,

Question about ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G3.1.2.9 (calculation for fan energy
use):

does this apply only to the baseline model?  I assume that actual fan
power should be used for the proposed design, but ASHRAE doesn't state
it explicitly.

Also, should fan power use be calculated for each space served by an
independent system, or for the whole building?

I am modeling a building that is supplied with baseboard heat, and no
cooling.  There are a number of small offices that have independent
thermostats for heating.  As per LEED requirements, these spaces must be
modeled as having mechanical cooling.  Some of the spaces only require
2-300 cfm of supply air.  If I do the calculation for each space, I end
up with 8 watts/cfm!!!  (can't be right)

Thanks for any input,

~Karen~

I've interpreted Appendix G that they fan sizing is for the baseline
building only; use actual fan sizes for the proposed building.

The fan sizing run should only apply to the 8 predefined system options
in Appendix G for your building type.  So, if you're taking one of these
defined systems that applies to your building and modeling it on each of
your proposed spaces, you would have to do a sizing run for each system.
The sizing run should be at the HVAC system level.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Appendix G Supply Fan Power

Hi All,

Question about ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G3.1.2.9 (calculation for fan energy
use):

does this apply only to the baseline model?  I assume that actual fan
power should be used for the proposed design, but ASHRAE doesn't state
it explicitly.

Also, should fan power use be calculated for each space served by an
independent system, or for the whole building?

I am modeling a building that is supplied with baseboard heat, and no
cooling.  There are a number of small offices that have independent
thermostats for heating.  As per LEED requirements, these spaces must be
modeled as having mechanical cooling.  Some of the spaces only require
2-300 cfm of supply air.  If I do the calculation for each space, I end
up with 8 watts/cfm!!!  (can't be right)

Thanks for any input,

~Karen~

Hello Everyone,

 

I was reviewing the DOE2 help documentation in eQUEST and came across some
syntax that may be helpful for extracting results data out of the sim file.
Does anyone have experience using the code below?  They are all used in
conjunction with the NHRList.txt file.  Can these be used within eQUEST?  If
so, how are they implemented?

 

 SimulationResults( ) or #SRes( )

 

FlagResultForRetrieval(  ResultID,  "KeyString",  DefaultValue  ) or #FRFR(
)

 

RetrieveFlaggedResults( ) or #RFR( )

 

 

Thanks in advance for any help/clarification.

 

Sincerely,

 

John

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200711141609.AA0945203pd80004063164@gard.com>

Greetings:

I think I've wrestled with this long enough and it's time to invoke the
collection of greater minds on this list service for help.  

I am using eQUEST models to compare scenarios and I find that changing
from a fan-coil system (two-pipe) to a PTAC system (with HW coil heating
using the same two-pipe loop) causes a 3 fold increase in ventilation
fan energy for this system.  This is distorting the energy use
projections between these two scenarios.

Is there a logical explanation for this?  I have run a number of
parametrics to try to isolate the cause for the difference in Vent Fan
energy.  The fan power parameters are the same.  Fan control and flow
parameters appear to be consistent.  The systems take outdoor air from
another system and the Vent Fan energy does not appreciably change for
that system.  For the real world, I would not expect to see a huge
change in fan energy if I change the cooling source from a chilled water
coil to a refrigerant coil.  What is happening in the model that I don't
understand?

Many thanks in advance to all who are able to give time and wisdom to
this.

Hi,

I was looking at several websites the last week to survey geothermal
heat pumps for a simulation project.

As a result I discovered that TRANE quit taking orders for Geothermal
heat pumps on September 30 this year.  As soon as the standing orders
are filled they will shut down production permanently.  

Don't get caught modeling something that is no longer available.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] DOE 2.1E Hourly Report Question

I added the following code to a DOE 2.1E file to obtain the hourly electric
(32) and gas consumption (45).  The code was added in the systems block.

Where is the hourly report exported to? I was under the impression that it
goes to the .sim file and would be called RB-1, but when I open that file it
doesn't show up (the .sim file also gives me an out of memory message- could
this be causing the problem?).  Thanks for any insight in advance.

That's not correct; DOE-2.2 does not have user-defined functions
implemented. I believe that the 2.2 development team has stated that it
would be a significant amount of work to introduce this capability back
into DOE-2.2 because of the messy way they were originally implemented
in DOE2.1E. I wouldn't count on seeing user-defined functions in 2.2
anytime soon.

 

You can use macros in 2.2 but not user-defined functions.

Rick - My understanding is that the FUNCTION capabilities are fully
implemented in DOE-2.2/eQUEST. Create your building using eQUEST, save &
close then add in the functions. Do this with a text editor and work
directly with the *.inp file in the project directory. When you open the
file again, the functions keywords are ignored by the eQUEST interface,
but the commands are executed by DOE-2.2. Remember that eQUEST is a GUI
for DOE-2, the engine hasn't changed. Tracking down errors is just the
same as 2.1e, look in the *.sim and output.out files for help.

Does anyone know if/when/how user defined FUNCTION capabilities are
going to be implemented in eQUEST (DOE 2.2)? I have a few I have
developed in the past for DOE 2.1E and am needing to do something
similar for a current modeling effort, but am required to use eQUEST as
my modeling software. It struck me as weird that all the syntax
instruction is in the DOE 2.2 documentation (probably carried over from
previous versions) but then noted as not available. Any feedback would
be appreciated.

If you are using DOE2.1 e (not eQuest), the hourly report file gets
generated in the main doe2.1 folder - and it has a non-intuitive name
which I forget at this time and most probably the extension is .dat. The
reference manual explains this under the hourly reporting chapter.

Jon---

One nice way to access your hourly report is to export it from eQUEST
into Excel.  Under the File tab, you'll see the option to "Export Hourly
Results..." after you've simulated the model.  You can then open the
.csv file in Excel and look at your results.  However, the hourly report
should be hidden somewhere in the .sim file...try to open it in a text
editor and do a search for 'hourly report'.  

Another quick and easy way to create hourly reports is in the "Project &
Site" tab in the detailed edit mode.  There is an extensive list of all
of the different variables and attributes you can have reported.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200711131426.AA2620812pd80004048441@gard.com>

EnergyPlus Version 2.1 Now Available

 

The newest version of EnergyPlus (2.1) was completed on October 31, 2007
and is now available in versions for both the Windows and Linux
operating systems. (Macintosh version will be available within a few
days.)  A few key new features include new packaged terminal air
conditioner, multi-speed heat pump, and additional controls for modeling
hybrid ventilation systems. We have updated and extended capabilities
throughout the existing building envelope, daylighting, and HVAC
equipment and systems portions of the program. 

 

EnergyPlus V 2.1 is available at no cost from the EnergyPlus web site:
www.energyplus.gov <http://www.energyplus.gov/> .   

 

What's New in Version 2.1?

 

A few of the new features in EnergyPlus V 2.1 are listed below-see
http://www.energyplus.gov/features.html
<http://www.energyplus.gov/features.html>  for a complete list of new
features added in this and previous versions:

*         Zone sizing calculations now include heat gains from
domestic/service hot water uses and water heaters.

*         User now can choose between ASHRAE Clear Sky and Zhang-Huang
solar radiation models for use in design day calculations.

*         Added new system availability manager to allow system-level
control of hybrid ventilation systems.

*         Added water-cooled condenser capability to refrigeration
compressor racks for useful heat recovery. 

*         Chilled and hot-water coils can now be used in the outside air
system to preheat or precool outside air.

*         New desiccant dehumidifier with additional capabilities and
flexibility compared to the existing solid desiccant dehumidifier model.

*         Water side economizer (including simulation of integrated and
non-integrated water side economizers).

*         Water heater improved for indirect heating (e.g. with remote
boiler) and autosizable design flow rates for plant connections.  

*         Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) added to model a fan,
DX cooling coil, and a gas, electric, hydronic or steam heating coil
serving a single zone.

*         Multispeed heat pump with up to four discrete speeds for both
cooling and heating.

*         Heat losses (and gains) from plant piping.

*         Many new or updated Compact HVAC objects, including: options
for dehumidification and humidification controls for unitary and VAV
system types, primary-secondary loop options for Compact HVAC chilled
water loops, outside air can be specified as flow/person, flow/area or
flow/zone, baseboard heat option added for unitary and VAV zones, and
new Compact HVAC objects for unitary heat pump, unitary VAV, packaged
terminal air conditioner, and packaged terminal heat pump. 

*         New tabular reports for surface shadowing, shading, lighting,
HVAC sizing, system and component sizing, and outside air.

*         New Report:SurfaceColorScheme allow users to select their own
colors for building elements in the DXF output.

*         WeatherConverter now produces KML output (for Google Earth) of
latitude, longitude, elevation, and a few climate statistics for
locations in a list processing run. 

*         Completely rewritten Getting Started manual provides more
hands-on example exercises and other information for getting up to speed
on EnergyPlus.

 

Input/Output Reference and Engineering Reference updated and extended
for all new features and updates. Total documentation now exceeds 3500
pages. And many other enhancements and significant speed improvements
throughout.

 

Update on User Interfaces?

 

Where's the plugin for Google's SketchUp drawing software?   Not quite
ready.  We hope to release that within a few more weeks.  Users will be
able to draw their building, paint the surfaces with thermophysical
properties, select default building type information, schedules, and
HVAC systems, and simulate the energy performance of their building-all
within SketchUp.  Watch the EnergyPlus web site and email for more
information.

 

EP-Quick creates an EnergyPlus input file based on a broad range of zone

EnergyPlus Training Workshops

 

We are planning workshops throughout 2008.  For more information, please
see:  http://www.gard.com/training.htm
<http://www.gard.com/training.htm> 

 

What's going on in V2.1.0?

 

Will there be any considerable difference between version 2.0 and 2.1? 

 

Yes.... and no. The basic structure of EnergyPlus is still as it has
been but there are some significant changes that you will want to be
aware of:

 

As always, there are a number of new features and bug fixes.

 

How about IDF and IDD? Do they remain unchanged? 

 

There will be some changes in the IDD and reflected in IDFs.
Particularly for any new features, there will be new objects. 

 

Is version 2.1 backward compatible? Can I run v2.0 file in v2.1? 

 

For many options, the answer is yes. However, there are several changes
that require you to use the transition program for V2.1. EP-Launch can
check the selected file (if there is a version object) and you can
launch the Transition program from the EP-Launch "File" menu. You can
also view the ObjectStatus spreadsheet in the root folder of the
installed version. This file has detailed explanations of changes to the
objects. There is also a new option for the transition program that
allows you to supply a list of files and it will convert them for you.
The transition program is described more fully in the Auxiliary Programs
document.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200711122204.AA0446437pd50004046649@gard.com>

Please excuse the cross-postings...

 

Abstracts due December 1 for SimBuild 2008.

 

IBPSA-USA is accepting abstracts for SimBuild 2008 only until December
1!

Abstracts may be submitted via our website at
http://gaia.lbl.gov/ocs/index.php/simbuild/2008

 

Student scholarships will be available on a competitive basis to be
awarded according to the quality of the submitted paper.

 

Please note that Dec. 1, 2007 is a firm deadline for all abstracts. See
below for more information about SimBuild 2008 including other key
deadlines.

 

SimBuild 2008

 

IBPSA-USA will hold its third national conference, July 30 to August 1,
2008 on the campus of the University of California at Berkeley. The
format will be similar to the two previous SimBuild conferences held at
the University of Colorado at Boulder in 2004 and at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in 2006.

 

The conference organizers are limiting the number of peer-reviewed oral
presentations in order to maintain a high level of quality in the
papers.  Submissions will therefore be rigorously peer-reviewed.
Abstracts are due by 1 December 2007 (firm deadline) and may be on a
variety of building and environmental simulation topics, such as: system
or component modeling, simulation algorithm development, CFD
applications, IAQ, acoustics, energy, lighting, life safety, weather,
city-scale environmental simulations, or case studies that exhibit
in-depth use of simulation software.  Authors should indicate a
preference for poster or oral presentation.  In addition, a limited
number of non-peer-reviewed oral presentations (seminar type) are sought
in order to enable practitioners and researchers to address
simulation-related issues of strong current interest, such as topics
related low or Zero Energy Buildings, performance based code compliance
- please contact Philip Haves <phaves at lbl.gov> <mailto:phaves at lbl.gov>
(510) 486 6512.

 

The meeting is open to all, world-wide. Being near San Francisco,
Berkeley is a convenient destination for travelers from major cities in
the U.S. and in many other countries.  U.C. Berkeley is the oldest
campus of the University of California system, which also operates the
well-known Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the Lawrence Hall of
Science, the Space Sciences Laboratory, and the U.C. Botanical Garden.
The city of Berkeley contains a variety of neighborhoods with diverse
character and excellent restaurants.  The "Bay Area" is full of visitor
attractions accessible within 20 minutes, such as the city of San
Francisco, scenic mountains, and rich architecture (including the Frank
Lloyd Wright Civic Center).  Numerous wineries are within one hour
travel to the Napa and Sonoma valleys, where wine-tasting tours are
available.   

 

Key Dates:

Sep 15                 Call for abstracts

Dec 1                   Abstracts due (firm deadline)

Peter,
 
You are correct.  Appendix G does not provide any path for compliance with
Standard 90.1.  It is used only for demonstrating energy performance that
may exceed the Standard.  SSPC 90.1, however, is debating whether to propose
that this Appendix G become ?Normative? rather than ?Informative?, meaning
that it would be required.  I think the committee is a long way from
bringing this to fruition.

It is my understanding that what you state below is not actually correct.
demonstrating savings via Appendix G does not demonstrate compliance with
the standard. If you do not meet the mandatory provisions you do not meet
the prerequisite. If you do not meet the prescriptive requirements then
officially you need to demonstrate compliance via the ECB method (chapter
11) in a pass/fail mode. 
 
provided you pass, then you use Appendix G to demonstrate savings.
 
all - correct me if I am wrong here.

Thanks to everyone for weighing in on this. It  turns out my question

Which brings up the question - given that LEED now requires a minimum of 2
energy reduction credits to be earned, what's the point of the prerequisite

EAp2 requires compliance with both sections 5.4-10.4 (mandatory requirements) and 5.5-10.5 (prescriptive requirements). From my understanding, using Appendix G to determine EAc1 points demonstrates compliance with only prescriptive requirements, and not with the mandatory requirements. These requirements include labeling of mechanical equipment (6.4.1.5.1), service hot water piping insulation (7.4.3), and other requirements that cannot be described in an energy model. 
 
The LEED NC 2.2 reference manual says on page 164: "If energy simulations have been developed to document points earned for EA Credit 1, these energy simulations may be used rather than the ECB to demonstrate compliance with the prerequisite," but later in Table 2 on page 167 says that the mandatory measures for "all projects" must be met. 
 
Has anyone dealt with this issue directly?

Peter,

 

You are correct in the interpretation of the ASHRAE rules and regulations. 

 

However, for those working on a LEED project, the USGBC allows the Appendix G analysis to suffice for the minimum energy performance prerequisite. I was doing both (Appendix G and ECB) until I learned about this allowance, which is stated in the LEED-NC Reference Guide (Oct 2005) on page 164.  I guess you could produce a reduced energy use building with Appendix G and not meet ECB; but to meet the LEED point threshold (10.5%) it's still most likely you meet ECB.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] LEED EA Prerequisite 1 and eQUEST

 

It is my understanding that what you state below is not actually
correct. demonstrating savings via Appendix G does not demonstrate
compliance with the standard. If you do not meet the mandatory
provisions you do not meet the prerequisite. If you do not meet the
prescriptive requirements then officially you need to demonstrate
compliance via the ECB method (chapter 11) in a pass/fail mode. 

 

provided you pass, then you use Appendix G to demonstrate savings.

 

all - correct me if I am wrong here.

Thanks to everyone for weighing in on this. It  turns out my question
regarding LEED was a little premature - you can use your Appendix G
documentation for this.

 

Which brings up the question - given that LEED now requires a minimum of
2 energy reduction credits to be earned, what's the point of the
prerequisite documentation?

The lighting design handbook recommends illuminance levels anywhere from
150 to 100 fc.  As for the luminance, that depends on the color and type
of surface.

	Dear All,

	I am trying to look at glare issues for tennis courts using
Radiance. I do not know what the interior lighting will be like. Is
there a way to find out the minimum lighting required by code for tennis
courts?

	 

	Let me know.

For LEED purposes, the EAP2 requirement will be met by certifying that
you meet the mandatory requirements in the standard, and any one of:

 

1)      Prescriptive compliance with standard

2)      Performance compliance with standard (ECB)

3)      Earning at least one point through EAC1

 

Now, it is a different question whether your local building code
official will accept the "one or more EAC1 points" point argument, along
the lines of what you've pointed out.

Vik:
 
eQuest in its present form only can develop California Title 24 forms.
There IS a 90.1 Version in the works, but it is not yet available. Stay
tuned.

I believe eQUEST will only produce overall performance for Title 24 not

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200711120144.AA4410250pd80004032579@gard.com>


Hi all,

I am modeling a multi-family building using eQuest and am having troubles finding out just where my energy cost is being doubled-exactly! Initially, I thought that I would utilize a commercial meter and a residential meter to reflect different billing rates, ran into some errors, and tried to get it back to one. It now runs without errors, except for the doubling...

Any thoughts on how to eliminate the this and/or set up separate meters?

thanks,
caleb

Hi Karen,

Without seeing all the details, its hard to offer specific
recommendations.  However one thing I would be sure to do is a reality
check -- following is a report from a nifty outside air load estimator
that I just found earlier today in the course of doing something else
(see this post
<http://elcca-exchange.blogspot.com/2007/11/outdoor-air-load-estimator.h
tml> ) which, after running your numbers through it, gives cause for
double-checking your calculated $450,000 per year savings (again, see
post for details).

Also, how does one properly model an ERV for a system that is not 100%
outdoor air?  How does it get modeled if the ventilation is demand
controlled?

Gavin,
If you input 250,000 CFM at the equipment level and let zones auto  
size a few things could happen.  If the fan is larger than the sum of  
the zone design airflows (diversified or undiversified) then the fan  
will always operate at part load.  Depending on the part load curve  
you have assumed and the actual method of fan speed control you could  
have dramatically different part load performance (% power as a  
function of % flow) - check both of these things.

Also DOE-2 allows you to input a kW/CFM or an efficiency combined  
with the pressure and flow.  Even the best backward curved airfoil  
fans may only achieve a wire to air efficiency of 67% - Fan total  
efficiency of 80%, belt drive / sheave efficiency 95%, VSD drive  
efficiency of 96%, motor efficiency of 92%.  And keep in mind this is  
applied to total pressure not static - static wire-air efficiency  
will be lower by the ratio of static to total pressure.  More  
standard Air Handlers probably have a wire to air efficiency of 55%  
or less.

Also don't underestimate duct leakage or damper leakage if the system  
is an existing high pressure system.

Regards,
Graham

I agree.  
1) The Solatube system assumes the outside lens, and it is a lens not 
just a clear piece of plastic, is level
and oriented in azimuth.
2) There are remotely operable dampers available for use inside the tube.
3)  There are electric lights available that replace the Sun at night.
4) There are angled joints and extension tubes available, reaching 2 
stories into the building should be no
problem...

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Light Tubes in eQuest

 
Hi Folks:

Fun for a Friday afternoon (in California).

I have been asked to model light tubes in a 3 story building, but only
for the top floor (GOOD).

However, there is a slanted roof/spacial area above the 3rd floor
ceiling. So I cannot directly install a skylight into the top floor
(BAD).

Any suggestions?

Thanks in advance.

Can you specify a small exterior "roof" just big enough for the light
tube(s) in each 3rd floor zone (use multipliers if there are multiple
tubes/zone or place several appropriately if daylighting is an issue).
Reduce the area of the actual roof accordingly and specify interior
ceilings next to the topmost space (adjusted for tube areas) in each
zone if thermal interactions are expected to amount to anything.

If the tubes are to be installed in the slanted portion of the roof (I
don't have a clear picture of how that space is configured) it gets more
interesting (fun?) if you want to take into consideration daylighting
issues. Maybe a vertical shade at each tube on the side that would be
"uphill" in the actual installation? Reduce the aperture of the skylight
to account for less projected area normal to a horizontal surface? Don't
know about adjusting glass properties. All this speaks more to the art
of modeling more than the science. Don't know that any of this ends your
"fun", but maybe something will strike a chord and get you closer. Good
luck.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Recent LEED EAc1 Clarifications (Prescriptive Option, LEED-CS lease agreements, & exterior lighting)
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200711091621.AA2152890pd80004024185@gard.com>

Hi All,

I just wanted to pass along a few recent clarifications from the USGBC that
may help you out with some of your projects:

   1. A prescriptive methodology for documenting energy improvements
   2. More specific guidance regarding methods for crediting future TI
   efficiency improvements in Core & Shell buildings
   3. Revision to an existing LEED-NC CIR that allows credit for exterior
   lighting (tradable surfaces only)

1. *A prescriptive method for documenting energy improvements (LEED-NC /
LEED-CS /LEED for schools)*.  The USGBC now allows us to use the "Advanced
Buildings Core Performance Guide" to document prescriptive compliance for
buildings less than 100,000 square feet (not including healthcare,
warehouse, or laboratory facilities).  As little as two, and as many as four
or five points are available using this approach (depending on building
type).

CS Errata Sheet: http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=3203

Schools Errata Sheet: http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=3169

I can't find the corresponding NC requirements on the new website, but based
on the most recent information I've seen, it pretty much matches the other
two.

2. *More specific guidance regarding methods for crediting TI efficiency
improvements in Core & Shell Buildings

*CS Errata Sheet: http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=3203

This compliance method is available to core and shell projects that
incorporate into tenant sales or lease agreements requirements as part of
the tenant scope of work. For LEED-CS certification, a core and shell
project must meet the mandatory and prescriptive requirements of
ASHRAE 90.12004 for all applicable building systems either through the
core and shell
design and construction scope, or through a tenant sales and lease
agreement. A combination of both is acceptable.  Provide the LEED letter
template for the credit pursued indicating the following:
?100% of the leased square footage is required to comply with the credit
requirements. Lease or sales agreements may be requested.
?100% of the unleased square footage shall comply with the credit
requirements when leased. A statement signed by the owner/developer that all
leases and/or sales agreements will comply may be requested.

3. *Revision to an existing CIR allowing credit for exterior lighting:
** 4/25/2007 - * *Credit Interpretation Request*
...[extracted text]...

7. Exterior Lighting
Will USGBC for LEED 2.2 allow credit for exterior lighting that is more
efficient than the new mandatory provision for exterior lighting in
90.1-2004 section 9.4. Appendix G does not address how exterior lighting
should be modeled for the baseline, and therefore the default is that it
should be modeled the same as the design and no credit for savings could be
taken.

...


    * 4/25/2007 - * *Ruling*
[REVISED 10/30/07 to allow energy savings for exterior lighting.]
..[extracted text]...
7. Yes, project teams can take credit for efficient exterior lighting within
ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G. Credit may only be taken for the tradable surfaces
listed in ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Table 9.4.5. All other exterior lighting must be
modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case. The Baseline case
exterior lighting power allowance should be calculated using the methodology
outline in Section 9.4.5.
...

Dear Karen:

 

The Master of Design (http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/academic/mdes/) and
Doctor of Design (http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/academic/ddes/) programs at
the Graduate School of Design (GSD) at Harvard both offer Environmental
Technology as a focus area. The school offers a basic course on
climate-responsive design as well as more focused courses on acoustics,
energy performance simulation, green roofs, lighting/daylighting, and
sustainability. I will be joining the GSD faculty in July 2008 to build
up a research group on daylighting and energy-efficient building design.
Please feel free to contact me should these areas be of interest to you
for your graduate work.

 

Applications for the DDES and MDES programs are due by January 19th
2008.

There are some other measurements you could take at the site such as VAV
box valve positions and AHU pressure set points and actual readings.
Power readings by themselves show a potential problem, but not the
potential causes.

You need to verify the accuracy of the model in other areas besides the
AHU as well.  Maybe the loads in the spaces for the real building are
higher than in the model.

Jim,

 

The fan static pressure has been set to the maximum of 8.0 WG (any higher and
the model will not run) despite the equipment schedule is stated as 10 WG.

 

As for the CFM, it is input at 250,000 cfm (according to the equipment data).

 

As for logger inaccuracy, we logged both supply fans and they checked out
against one another.

 

I have tried looking at all the parameters in the simulation that might affect
the vent fans energy and demand, including operating schedules, but were
unable to find any that might justify the differences.

 

 

With regards

Gavin Gui

It sounds like you need increase the fan static pressure or kW/CFM in eQUEST
(you stated these are high pressure fans, so I assume the power use is higher
than a typical fan), confirm you have the correct CFM inputted into the model,
or double check the accuracy of the logger data.

 

Jim

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Ventilation Fans

Hi, I am using eQuest to simulate a mid-rise commercial building. The HVAC
system is a simple setup whereby huge axial vane supply fans provide 55F cold
air, under high pressure, to the VAV boxes located at the respective floors.
The air is returned via ducts using similar fans located near the system.
However the modeled results obtained for the vent fans electric demand and
consumption differ greatly from the logged data obtained from the site. The
actual data shows about 75% higher than the model results, both in demand and
consumption.

 

I would greatly appreciate if anyone can advise me on where the problem is or
if there is any way I can fine tune the model to be closer to the actual data.
Thank you. 

 

With regards,

Gavin Gui

Hello!

There have been a few posts over the last few months about ERVs.  I
know I posted some questions about them recently...

I am currently doing a rough model of a 43,000 square foot building.
This building houses all sorts of scientific labs and is provided with
183,000 cfm.  The systems are mostly archaic constant volume 90-100%
outdoor air dual duct air handlers.  The building is located in
Vermont.

I let the wizard generate the building shell (4 floors above ground, 1
below, perimiter/zone zoning, 2 watts per square foot for lighting and
equipment) and specified 4.26 cfm/ square foot ventilation air for
each zone.  I created a parametric run for the ERV:

RECOVER-EXHAUST = YES
ERV-RECOVER-TYPE = SENSIBLE-HX
ERV-LATENT-EFF = 0.6000
ERV-RUN-CTRL = WHEN-MIN-OA
ERV-OA-STATIC = 1.5
ERV-EXH-STATIC = 0.75

This should allow the economizer to take over when the cooling needs
can be met by outdoor air.

The result was about $70,000 savings per year.  This number seemed
extremely low as I know of an installed 8,000 cfm 100% oudoor air
system a few miles away that has saved the owners $20,000 per year.

I took a look at Brandon's recommendation that the system be specified
as PSZ or SZRH, but a dual duct system operates significantly
differently than either of these, and specifying SZRH, I still got a
very small cost savings.

Then, I changed the zone ventilation requirements to 0 cfm, and
specified the supply air for each system to be 4.26 cfm/sq ft, and OA
Fraction to be 1.  I left all Parametric run components the same.
Now, I'm coming up with $450,000 per year savings, which is much more
consistent with what I know about the 8,000 cfm system installed
nearby.

Why does the ERV seem to work when the cfm is specified at the system
level, but not when ventilation air is specified at the zone level?

Also, I am still seeing an increase in "space cooling" for the ERV
run.  I understand that the additional resistance of the ERV will
increase the output of the fan energy, and thus the heat of the
outdoor air, but it seems that the ERV should be recovering some cold
energy as well to at least break even on cooling.  Any thoughts?

I am facing an interesting problem I have never seen before.  For some reason I see a large amount of load (especially heating load) due to internal surface conduction.  Some 'mysterious' change to the original equest file lead to these loads.  I have looked at everything that may cause this difference and absolutely connot find anything.  Anyone ever seen this before?  I would be very very grateful if anyone could shed light on why this may happen.  I have checked all construction types, areas, space temperatures and schedules

Maren,

 

Being a new user myself I can only give you my experience with my own situation, which is similar to yours.  I had to model a multi-level school with different roof peaks and such.  The only way that I could make it work for me was to model each section of the building separate and then move them together in the building placement portion of the wizard.  This can only be done in the design development wizard (not sure if you knew that or not).  Let me know if I am being unclear.

Hello!

 

I am working on an eQuest model for a university building where one section is only one story, while another section is 2 stories.  Does anyone have any relatively quick solutions for modeling a building like this?  I have tried making one, 2 story building and then 'removing' the 2nd story zones as needed, but then can't seem to get the roofing to match up correctly (it has a 25? slope).  Also, the basement does not have the same footprint as the main floor and I am having problems getting the total building area to match up correctly.  

 

Since I am new to DOE-2 modeling, I don't quite have a great handle on anything outside of the wizards so any help or alternative solutions to this problem would be great!

 

Thank you,

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200711070947.AA4714453pd80004000712@gard.com>

Hi everyone,

We're launching a beta programme for Demeter - our new SketchUp-based
Green Building Extension - at Greenbuild 2007 today, with our partners
GreenBuildingStudio, Inc. People interested in participating can
download the beta here:

UHI SPIN-OUT COMPANY GREENSPACE RESEARCH LAUNCHES GOOGLE SKETCHUP GREEN
BUILDING EXTENSION

GREENSPACE RESEARCH LTD, a Stornoway-based spinout company from
Scotland?s UHI Millennium Institute is launching a green building
energy analysis plug-in for Google SketchUp at this week's Greenbuild
2007 conference in Chicago.  The plugin, called Demeter after the Greek
mother-earth goddess, enables users of SketchUp, the hugely popular
Google 3DCAD program, to send building models to Green Building Studio,
Inc web servers for energy analysis reports.  Energy lifecycle costs and
building carbon footprints are immediately reported to the user via a
Web browser. 

Greenspace Research is California-based Green Building Studio?s UK
partner and Demeter is one of  the fruits of a two year research
programme at Lews Castle College UHI in Stornoway. Green Building
Studio?s building energy design alternatives allows a wide range of
different constructions and HVAC systems to be evaluated for the effect
on energy costs, driving down carbon emissions as a result.

Dr. Neil Finlayson, Senior Researcher at Greenspace Research, believes
that a SketchUp-based energy analysis solution could make a significant
dent on building-related carbon emissions. "Google SketchUp has become
the world's most popular 3D CAD program because it is highly intuitive
and just incredibly easy to use. The feedback we've been getting from
architects and engineers interested in sustainability issues was that
they wanted to use SketchUp as a basis for energy analysis of their
models. We've developed a client which works with Green Building
Studio's servers to give them exactly that, and we hope it will have a
major impact on low carbon building design over the next few years."

The plug-in has the following features:

- Import  of existing gbXML models into SketchUp
- Internet-based energy analysis using  Green Building Studio
- View/Edit existing gbXML models.
- Apply building properties to existing SketchUp models

Demeter will be unveiled at this week's Greenbuild 2007 conference in
Chicago, and will be on early public beta release from this week. Full
production release is scheduled for end Q1 2008.

The latest version of Revit has the IES Apache load calculation software
built-in with no need to purchase IES <VE> for the purpose of heating
and cooling calculations. Further post processing can be done in <VE>
for things like daylighting, CFD, cost analysis etc. Further information
can be found in the following white papers.

Hi All;

I would like to use Revit from AutoDesk for load calculations. Revit
says that "IES that does the calcs is a 3rd party app. They have a
website - http://www.iesve.com/content/default.asp
<http://www.iesve.com/content/default.asp> "

 I will appreciate any feedback about the reliability of the results or
any feedback.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] eQuest: Macro for extracting data from a sim file -
SED Example

All,

 

See this post
<http://elcca-exchange.blogspot.com/2007/11/sed-equest-sim-file-reports.
html>  for an example script using SED to extract an individual report
from a SIM file. 

 

But wait, there's more!  Using the 'FOR' command, it can also extract
every similar report from all SIM files in a directory and save them to
single file for further processing (with say Awk, for instance ;-) or
output.  Its beginning to look to me like SED is most useful for gross
editing tasks -- i.e. global search-and-replacements or chunking out
reports.  SED = sledgehammer

 

Looks like Awk will be the ticket for precision tasks like selecting an
individual data value, doing arithmetic on columns, or creating your own
outside air loads report.  Awk = scalpel

 

More fun with SED & AWK coming in the months ahead...Jeff, would you
mind sharing some of your favorite Awk scripts?  There is a basic one by
Joe Huang in the archives.  Perhaps you have an indispensable gem like
say, an Outside Air Loads Report? ;-)

 

Thanks

Awk is also a good choice, here's an editorial comparison of Awk vs.
SED, with a link to tutorials for each:

http://unix.derkeiler.com/Newsgroups/comp.unix.shell/2004-08/0405.html

Awk is a programming language with arithmetic operators, array handling
etc., SED is essentially batch application of regular expressions. 

Given the platform independence of regular expressions, SED is my cup of
tea.  But as Jeff states the case, Awk would be an excellent tool for a
data extraction task -- back in the dark ages of DOS, I used Awk years
before learning SED to strip the colors from AutoCAD DXF files.

Jessica.

We use AWK, which can be obtained from Gnu software for a modest
donation (I.e. GAWK). Its incredibly powerful, and has a long history
from its origin at Bell labs as a unix toolkit. There are several good
books on AWK, including one by its creators: Aho, Weinberger and
Kernigan.

This work well on the FORTRAN-formatted output from DOE-2.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200711070429.AA293662pd80003997136@gard.com>

Hi all,
 
I have following problem according to the performance rating method
(appendix G) of the 90.1-2004 Ashrae standard. Hopefully someone can
help me.
The problem is I built the proposed design of a building that buys
external cooling power (and the thing is that it has to be bought
external because of the owners guidelines).
Now by building the baseline model there is the question how to include
this fact. If as written in the appendix G all cooling power would be
delivered
by a screw chiller then this would be much cheaper because the external
bought cooling power is more expensive than electricity.
In this case the baseline model would be more effective than the
proposed model what for sure is not aimed. 
Is there a possibility to avoid this fact and to seperate external
bought cooling power? 
I'm really looking forward to any feedback about this issue.
 
With kind regards
Christian

Matthew -

Here is an approach I am taking on a current project:

The project is an existing building with CMU walls, single pane glass
and no insulation. We are adding an open air atrium to the middle (for
daylight) and modifying two entrances.

The proposed building is full of energy efficient features (good
windows, daylighting, light shelves, geothermal heat pump, good
insulation, solar water heating, etc).

The baseline building model is exactly the same shape as the proposed
(Table G3.1, item 1) and includes the atrium and entrance modifications.
The existing building envelope characteristics such as single clear
glass, no insulation, roof, and walls, etc. are depicted in the baseline
model (per Table G3.1, item 5 (f)).

However, the components of the existing building that are being
modified, i.e. the atrium, and entrances (and in your case the
clerestory), are to be modeled in the baseline with ASHRAE 90.1-2004
minimum performance as these are new additions and alterations to the
existing building. 

The occupancy schedules, use, program, spaces, etc, are the same for the
baseline and proposed.

I would welcome any comment on this approach.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Existing Buildings 90.1

When modeling the baseline building for ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G should 
one assume that the following passage means to delete all new elements 
from the proposed model to create the baseline. I am specifically 
wondering about a section of roof that was raised to accommodate 
clerestories.

Section 5. Building Envelope - Sub-section (f):
"Existing Buildings. For existing building envelopes, the baseline 
building design shall reflect existing conditions prior to any revisions

that are part of the scope of work being evaluated."

Any help is appreciated.

awk is a functional subset of perl.  The language is more regular,
making it difficult to write incomprehensible scripts (which is far too
easy in perl).

Both are well-suited for modifying ascii input files and batch
simulation tasks. And both are free.

Are the advantages of AWK over PERL such that it is worth the effort 
to switch from Perl to AWK?

Are the advantages of AWK over PERL such that it is worth the effort

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200711052317.AA1754656pd80003984972@gard.com>

All,
 
See this post
<http://elcca-exchange.blogspot.com/2007/11/sed-equest-sim-file-reports.
html>  for an example script using SED to extract an individual report
from a SIM file. 
 
But wait, there's more!  Using the 'FOR' command, it can also extract
every similar report from all SIM files in a directory and save them to
single file for further processing (with say Awk, for instance ;-) or
output.  Its beginning to look to me like SED is most useful for gross
editing tasks -- i.e. global search-and-replacements or chunking out
reports.  SED = sledgehammer
 
Looks like Awk will be the ticket for precision tasks like selecting an
individual data value, doing arithmetic on columns, or creating your own
outside air loads report.  Awk = scalpel
 
More fun with SED & AWK coming in the months ahead...Jeff, would you
mind sharing some of your favorite Awk scripts?  There is a basic one by
Joe Huang in the archives.  Perhaps you have an indispensable gem like
say, an Outside Air Loads Report? ;-)
 
Thanks

Awk is also a good choice, here's an editorial comparison of Awk vs.
SED, with a link to tutorials for each:

http://unix.derkeiler.com/Newsgroups/comp.unix.shell/2004-08/0405.html

Awk is a programming language with arithmetic operators, array handling
etc., SED is essentially batch application of regular expressions. 

Given the platform independence of regular expressions, SED is my cup of
tea.  But as Jeff states the case, Awk would be an excellent tool for a
data extraction task -- back in the dark ages of DOS, I used Awk years
before learning SED to strip the colors from AutoCAD DXF files.

Jessica.

We use AWK, which can be obtained from Gnu software for a modest
donation (I.e. GAWK). Its incredibly powerful, and has a long history
from its origin at Bell labs as a unix toolkit. There are several good
books on AWK, including one by its creators: Aho, Weinberger and
Kernigan.

This work well on the FORTRAN-formatted output from DOE-2.

You can override the calculated default volume entry with a value from a

Justin:

Now you are mentioning adjacent spaces, which adds another dimension to
this "sticky wicket."

Is it so important to have the walls angled for your atrium space at
this cant? Cannot you simply take the average of floor and ceiling and
apply it to your L x W x H for the atrium? I doubt if the load will
change much in your space.

I have never done this before, and it would not take too long to try the
"adjacent space" routine in eQuest.

Unfortunately, I have my OWN eQuest deadline.

Good luck.

John,

The space adjacent to these wall has the correct volume? space
definition is area polygon times a constant height right?

Correct me if I am wrong here.

We are seeing costs ranging from $10,000 to $25,000 and higher depending on the complexity and simulation software used, as well as the type of documentation required (LEED EAc1 documentation is an additional cost for example). For simpler quick and dirty models we have actually seen costs as low as $2,000.
 
The use of full field solutions is more expensive (CFD, RADTherm etc) ranging from $35K upwards depending on the complexity.
 
I would be curious to see how these costs come in with respect to other people's experience.

Hello,
 
Since there is no "Building Performance Simulation" section in Means Cost Data, I am wondering what the cost range is for building simulation services. Realizing this is a broad question, is anyone willing to offer the costs for anything from a "quick" eQuest simulation up to a detailed model that requires zone-by-zone data input?
 
Thanks,

Justin:

Is this an atrium that has outside walls as part of its construction?
You can ALWAYS tilts surfaces in +- vertical directions, with 0Deg =
face down, 90 Deg = vertical wall, and 180 Deg being a roof. So tilt
your walls and make your roof larger than your floor. And any windows in
those walls should have the same tilt as the walls automatically.

I see no reason why this won't work.

Hi All,

Does anyone know what the definition of a "floor" is for purposes of system
selection in Appendix G?  I am modeling a building with two definite floors,
plus a basement containing some mechanical space and a server room.  The
building also has a conditioned attic for storage and mechanical space.  I
believe this falls under system 3 (Nonresidential & 3 floors or less & <
75,000 ft2), but would like to see a definition for future reference.

Awk is also a good choice, here's an editorial comparison of Awk vs. SED, with a link to tutorials for each:

http://unix.derkeiler.com/Newsgroups/comp.unix.shell/2004-08/0405.html

Awk is a programming language with arithmetic operators, array handling etc., SED is essentially batch application of regular expressions.  

Given the platform independence of regular expressions, SED is my cup of tea.  But as Jeff states the case, Awk would be an excellent tool for a data extraction task -- back in the dark ages of DOS, I used Awk years before learning SED to strip the colors from AutoCAD DXF files.

Jessica. 

We use AWK, which can be obtained from Gnu software for a modest donation (I.e. GAWK). Its incredibly powerful, and has a long history from its origin at Bell labs as a unix toolkit. There are several good books on AWK, including one by its creators: Aho, Weinberger and Kernigan.

This work well on the FORTRAN-formatted output from DOE-2.

Hi all,

I am looking for a way to model an atrium that has a wider base than the 
top. Is there a way to specify tilted wall in eQuest?

Thanks and regards,

Jessica. 

We use AWK, which can be obtained from Gnu software for a modest donation (I.e. GAWK). Its incredibly powerful, and has a long history from its origin at Bell labs as a unix toolkit. There are several good books on AWK, including one by its creators: Aho, Weinberger and Kernigan.

This work well on the FORTRAN-formatted output from DOE-2.

I need to extract data from a sim file. I have over 1600 runs to make and need only one piece of data from the SIM file. Has anyone put together a macro like this before? Examples...

Jessica, 
 
I would use SED, which uses regular expressions to operate on text
files.  By coincidence, I just completed a post today on regular
expressions
<http://elcca-exchange.blogspot.com/2007/10/multiedit-regular-expression
s.html>  using MultiEdit to operate on .inp files.  Have used SED for
many utilitarian tasks similar to what you describe -- can you e-mail me
the part of the sim file containing the data you want to extract?

I would like clarification of what to do when situations that arise where
two spaces will be adjacent to one wall or alternatively, if the 1st floor
has two spaces and the 2nd floor has one space.  When creating interior
walls the space it is next to will need to be input.  So for example, if I
create an interior floor for the second floor of a building I will need
input what space it is next to.  I am assume the reason why this even needs
to be inputted so that it identifies what kind of loads that wall will
undergo.  So what is the best way to deal this?  Shall I just create one
floor and place it next to the space with the bigger load or would it be
most accurate to create two separate interior floors to correspond with the
spaces next to.  

 

I know it is probably just a waste of time to deal with something like this
but I am curious.  Has anyone previously studied this before or is there any
documentation regarding best methods for energy modeling.

I thank you for your response.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200711011627.AA2700578pd80003958453@gard.com>

Dear all,

I have two eQuest questions:

1. How to simulate air compressors with chilled water cooling in eQuest?
I want to simulate the cooling energy consumption of several air compressors
that are directly cooled by chilled water.
2. How to manually set chillers' operation sequence (stage) in eQuest?
I have several air cooled and water cooled chillers. They all connect to one
chilled water loop, but they have different efficiency rates and sizes. I
want to model the chillers' operations exactly following the 'real'
sequences (I know the 'real' sequence).

Any comments will be appreciated.

Thanks!
Gang

I am modeling a high rise (25+ stories) building with daylighting and
typical floor-by-floor overhead VAV systems. For some reason, when I
introduce continuous daylighting control the cooling and fan energy use
are increasing though the lighting energy use is decreasing. Has anyone
come across this situation? It appears like there may be a bug... as
this phenomenon is difficult to explain.

Thanks for the help.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Geothermal heat pump and LEED
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200711011308.AA081246pd80003956161@gard.com>

Hi, 

I've a question regarding what will be the baseline HVAC system for a proposed geothermal heat pump system when conducting LEED required performance rating?

I heard from some engineers at Colorado that they are required to compare the proposed geothermal heat pump (GHP) system with a baseline GHP when they conduct energy performance rating simulation for LEED purpose. I'm really surprised by knowing this. Is it true?

Per Appendix G of ASHRAE standard 90.1 (2004 version), "the HVAC systems in the baseline building design shall be based on usage, number of floors, conditioned floor area, and heating source as specified in Table G3.1.1A and shall conform with the system descriptions in Table G3.1.1B. I does not see in these tables any specific requirement for GSHP being simulated in the baseline building. Do I mis-understand anything in the standard?

I'll appreciate if anyone can share your experience/understanding on this issue.

Thanks,

Xiaobing

When modeling the baseline building for ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G should 
one assume that the following passage means to delete all new elements 
from the proposed model to create the baseline. I am specifically 
wondering about a section of roof that was raised to accommodate 
clerestories.

Section 5. Building Envelope - Sub-section (f):
"Existing Buildings. For existing building envelopes, the baseline 
building design shall reflect existing conditions prior to any revisions 
that are part of the scope of work being evaluated."

Any help is appreciated.
