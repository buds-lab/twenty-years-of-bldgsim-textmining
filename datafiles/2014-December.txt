Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED Certification query
Message-ID: <CAD58QRL8bd0gxrtOFKrJiwYpx5+YuM9T6MXDQDQbEwyiEbQSJg@mail.gmail.com>

HI,

I am trying to apply for LEED certification as per LEED v3 2009 in India.
My project profile is as follows:

1.       It an existing building that has been in use for over a decade.

2.       It underwent an HVAC retrofit 2 years back

3.       The entire building is leased out to multiple tenants



Ideally, we would have to apply for LEED: Existing buildings O&M. But
considering the entire building has been leased out to tenants, the owner
does not have control over its O&M of the fitouts. Moreover, all the
tenants have not connected to the new HVAC system. I wish to know if I can
apply for LEED: Core and Shell under major renovations.

Generally there would need to be a larger renovation taking place than just HVAC in order to enter either NC or C&S rating systems.

EB: O&M seems like the much clearer choice in this case...maybe pursuit of LEED will help build tenant engagement going forward. It is common for multiple tenant buildings to use EB: O&M rating system.

However you should contact the USGBC directly, they are used to helping people determine the best rating system based on your case.

One of the first pages of the rating system document should be "am I using the correct rating system?" with some guidance and contact information.

We have a building that uses VRF systems for Space cooling/heating. However the Outdoor air is conditioned using Hot/Chilled water from the campus loop. This poses a challenge in selecting the baseline.If anybody and experienced this situation could you please hint on your approach.Thanks.

It would be easiest if you used option 2 per the USGBC district energy modeling guidelines.  Then the baseline doesn't change.  I would then choose heating source based on the predominant system, which I would assume is the VRF.

Dear David,
Pushkala is my colleague and thank you for your reply.

Javed we did send an email to mailto:leedinfo at usgbc.org but haven't got a response yet from them. The mail was sent a week ago.

If any of you have any other contacts phone numbers or email addresses of gbci or usgbc that would be great. We have also tried LEEDuser but haven't found any luck yet.

Any help on this would be much appreciated. 

Kind regards,
Dr. Apeksha Gupta

Message-ID: <54837AAF.9060907@lbl.gov>

As the deadline for abstracts draws closer, I'd like to echo the recent 
encouragements to participate in the Building Simulation 2015 conference 
in Hyderabad, India next December  The recently extended deadline for 
abstracts is December 10; however, it's worth considering attending even 
if you don't expect to present a paper.

I had the opportunity to visit the conference site a couple of weeks 
ago. As would be expected of any international conference venue, the 
place is safe, clean, modern and comfortable. I would go so far as to 
say that the facilities at the conference center and the adjoining hotel 
are significantly superior to those at any previous Building Simulation 
conference. The conference center is set in its own extensive grounds 
and the hotel rooms are attractively priced by international standards ( 
~$100/night). The site is close to the IT and university sector of the 
city - Google, IBM, MIcrosoft, Oracle, and a number of well-known 
financial institutions are located just a few miles away, between the 
conference site and the Westin Hotel.

I look forward to seeing many of you in Hyderabad.

Apeksha,

It?s not uncommon for 2-3 week initial response times for inquiries to USGBC. Once they respond to your initial inquiry, you?ll see response times closer to 12-24 hours for any additional clarification until the question is resolved. Just did this a week ago regarding a LEED project boundary question.


For preliminary guidance, you should follow the 40-60 Rule.

If less than 40% of your building program doesn?t fit into a LEED system, then it likely shouldn?t be using that LEED system.

If more than 60% of your building program fits into a particular LEED system, then you should use that LEED system.

If it?s in between, it?s the team?s choice.


Another item to check is if you?re meeting all the prerequisites for any of the LEED systems you?re considering. One that often catches people off guard in LEED EB is the requirement to upgrade the plumbing system.


Hope that helps,

Fred

You know when your looking for something on the internet and find something
completely unrelated but more interesting.

That just happened to me, and it is related to buildings.

Here is the closest I found to "modeling":

Subject: [Bldg-sim] ADMIN - Bounces from yahoo and others causing
	unsubscribes
Message-ID: <548890D9.4030505@gard.com>

Yesterday I received notice that over 100 people 
unsubscribed from BLDG-SIM all at the same time. This was 
very suspicious and so today I manually resubscribed those 
people to the mailing list. Most of the messages were for 
subscribers with Yahoo or Hotmail addresses although there 
were some others as well. Upon investigation I believe it 
was the automatic "bounce" processing of the mailing list 
software that got tripped up from a change by Yahoo back in 
April. Essentially, the mailing list keeps track of messages 
that get bounced back from certain addresses and if it 
happens too often it assumes that the person has abandoned 
that email account and unsubscribes them from the mailing 
list. Unfortunately, because of a way Yahoo has marked some 
of its messages, this is happening erroneously. I am not 
sure what I can do about it at this point but will continue 
to investigate.  Here is an article about the whole topic:

http://www.pcworld.com/article/2141120/yahoo-email-antispoofing-policy-breaks-mailing-lists.html

If you have a Yahoo or Hotmail address (or any other 
address, I suppose) and at some point in the future notice 
that you are not receiving email from the BLDG-SIM mailing 
list, please check the archives and see if you really have 
missed any email:

http://lists.onebuilding.org/pipermail/bldg-sim-onebuilding.org/

If you have, please try to resubscribe by sending a blank 
email to:

bldg-sim-subscribe at onebuilding.org

If this happens more than once, please let me know.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Jason

Cory,
I'm not sure I agree. Assuming the campus loop HW is from fossil fuel boilers, this seems to be a "hybrid" heating source for the conditioned areas. I.e. heating they receive is provided by both electricity and fossil fuels. Thus the baseline systems are from the "fossil fuel/hybrid" column. "Predominant" refers to size of floor area served, not proportion of the heat to any given area. There is an ASHRAE 90.1 interpretation for hybrid definition posted for 2007 I believe, and a recent unofficial interpretation re-emphasized that even a small proportion of fossil fuel heat to a "system" makes it a hybrid.

It would be easiest if you used option 2 per the USGBC district energy modeling guidelines.  Then the baseline doesn't change.  I would then choose heating source based on the predominant system, which I would assume is the VRF.

We have a building that uses VRF systems for Space cooling/heating. However the Outdoor air is conditioned using Hot/Chilled water from the campus loop. This poses a challenge in selecting the baseline.

If anybody and experienced this situation could you please hint on your approach.
Thanks.

John,
One thing you can do is open the sim file for a 3.65 project using the D2SimViewer that comes with 3.64. Open D2SimViewer from the eQUEST 3-64 folder in ?Program File (x86)? or wherever else you have it, then select your 3.65 sim file.

	the Bauhaus-University Weimar
Message-ID: <006701d015ed$0c848bf0$258da3d0$@uni-weimar.de>

Dear All,

 

the Chair of Computer Science in Architecture (InfAR) at the
Bauhaus-University Weimar is offering a position for a research assistant /
PhD Candidate. The position starts at 01.04.2015 and is initially limited to
2 years.

 

Task description:

You participate in the BBSR-funded research project "Integrated Life Cycle
Optimization (ILCO) ? Methods for systematic design space exploration?. The
aim of the project is to develop methods that allow planners in the early
design-stages to systematically search for optimal spatial & material
configurations in order to fulfill life-cycle requirements. The focus is on
the issue that different influencing factors (building envelope, floor plan,
window layout, materials) affect each other and thus cannot easily be
optimized simultaneously. The position to be filled focuses on the
development of a method for multi-stage variant generation and optimization.

 

Requirements:

You hold a university degree in computer science, architecture or civil
engineering. You have strong skills in programming, optimization and
clustering methods, are detail-oriented and able to think at an abstract
scientific level. Your English skills (spoken and written) are very good.
Furthermore you are highly motivated, showing individual initiative and
willingness for multidisciplinary teamwork and cooperation with other
national and international research institutions.

 

Application:

Please send your application including a comprehensive CV, cover letter,
diplomas and work certificates until January, 30th to
<mailto:caad at architektur.uni-weimar.de> caad at architektur.uni-weimar.de

 

The Bauhaus-University Weimar is committed to increasing the proportion of
women in teaching and research and especially invites applications from
women. Severely disabled persons will be considered preferentially in the
case of equal aptitude.

Jacob,
The key here is that in order for one zone to get cooled at night, its fan
must operate.  The fan serves ALL of the zones, however, so ALL zones get
air (and cooling and heating)
Most VAV systems require a non-zero minimum airflow to maintain proper
outdoor air ventilation and maintain that scheme / minimum at all times -
even at night.
It's possible to control VAV boxes for zero minimum airflow in unoccupied
periods, but it would be unusual.
In most cases, the fan itself must also have a minimum airflow for stable
operation and to prevent variable speed drive overheating ... but that's
another problem....

Message-ID: <92B4D0F578AB284AAD350E3D3C74795C4960E878@TIS104.uopnet.plymouth.ac.uk>

The Board of Directors of IBPSA is seeking nominations for Awards to be presented at Building Simulation 2015, in Hyderabad, India (7-9 December 2015).

IBPSA makes three awards for outstanding work in the building performance simulation field. These awards are made on a biennial basis at each Building Simulation Conference, providing there is a qualified candidate. In order to allow the awardees time to plan to attend, it is time to consider nominations for the up-coming conference in 2015. The three categories awarded are:

(1) IBPSA Distinguished Achievement Award
This award, formerly named the IBPSA Award for Distinguished Service to Building Simulation, recognizes an individual who has a distinguished record of contributions to the field of building performance simulation, over a long period. The award consists of a certificate and $500 (US). Awarded bi-annually.

(2) IBPSA Outstanding Young Contributor Award
This award recognizes an individual at the beginning of their career who has demonstrated potential for significant contributions to the field of building performance simulation. The award consists of a certificate and $500 (US). Awarded bi-annually.

(3) IBPSA Innovative Application Award
This award, formerly named the IBPSA Award for Distinguished Practice, recognizes an individual, group or firm, who has made a significant contribution to the effective application and/or advancement of building performance simulation in practice. The award may be given for a unique or noteworthy use of simulation in practice; development of simulation software or supporting software that has had a significant impact on industry practice; or other contribution that has advanced building performance simulation in practice. The award consists of a certificate and $US500. Awarded bi-annually.

Nominations for awards MUST be made by an independent third party.

Nominations for the Distinguished Achievement Award should include a brief CV which gives the history of involvement with building performance simulation, publications etc., and a summary of the nominee's specific contribution to the field of building performance simulation - e.g. in the development/ contribution to development of building performance simulation tools or in furthering knowledge in the field of application of building performance simulation, etc.

Nominations for the IBPSA Outstanding Young Contributor Award should include a brief CV, which gives a summary of the individual's contributions to the field of building performance simulation, their publications etc., and an assessment of the potential for future contributions arising from the individual.

Nominations for the Innovative Application Award should be accompanied by a summary of the individual's, group's or firm's contributions to the field of building performance simulation in practice and an assessment of the significance of these contributions.

Nominations must be submitted via email to the Chair of the Awards and Fellows Committee, Pieter de Wilde, at pieter.dewilde at plymouth.ac.uk.
The deadline for nominations for the IBPSA Awards  is 14 March 2015.
We would like as many nominations as possible, so please contact Pieter de Wilde to discuss a possible nomination if required.


Note that IBPSA still has a call open for Nominations for the 2015 Class of Fellows, and will, at a later stage, call for nominations for the Student Travel Awards. In order for the committee to process all nominations, we have phased these over three deadlines. Nominations for Fellow of IBPSA will be due on 31 January 2015, nominations for Awards on 14 March 2015, and nominations for the Student Travel Awards on 15 April 2015. Details on the different categories can be found at www.ibpsa.org<http://www.ibpsa.org> through the 'awards' page.

Hello all -

Full disclosure I'm an architecture intern, but I had a general question about how VAV systems are controlled.

If you have one central VAV system with a boiler and a chiller, and lets say its serving 10 zones.  At night with the proper night cycle control, during unoccupied hours if only one of those zones floats above the setback and calls for cooling - do all of the vav terminals come on as well? Or does the entire system energize and deliver cold air just to that one VAV terminal?

The reason I ask, is that I'm modeling a large school with a VAV system in EnergyPlus.  When cycling at night, it looks like all of the terminals come on, even if they don't need the cooling.

If anyone can elaborate on how EnergyPlus (or other modeling programs) controls this aspect of VAV night cycling, and also how it works in the real world, that would be much appreciated.

Cheers,

Jacob,
Jim is correct.  There are a lot of issues that have to be dealt with with
a VAV system in setback.  First I'd suggest you read through an ASHRAE
Journal article from October 2011 titled "High Performance VAV Systems" and
then take a look at the Advanced Variable Air Volume System Design Guide
published by Pacific Gas & Electric in March 2007 before you model your
system.  If you have  a single zone bringing the system on at night - ask
yourself why?  Maybe there is an issue with that zone or room in that zone
(heat loss or heat gain) that has a 24 hour load and would be better
handled with a standalone system apart from your VAV system.  A few more
things:

   1. Model both supply air temperature reset and duct static pressure
   reset to minimize reheat in the cooling mode if possible.  In reality the
   two sequences are a little difficult to set up together in the field and
   will require some tweaking.
   2. Schedule the OA dampers off or closed in the unoccupied mode when it
   comes on just to satisfy a setback or setup condition - especially during
   heating because you can definitely subcool the rest of your building to
   the point it will never recover at morning warmup if the central system
   runs very long with cold air going to boxes with extreme/low setback
   temperatures (low 60's and mid 50's).
   3. If it is a small VAV system verify that you can keep minimum flow
   through your chiller and ask the manufacturer's rep how low the chiller
   would turn down and how often it may cycle or be timed out after it cycles.

Most of these conditions are design and operational issues - but they
should be modeled if possible to get an accurate picture of how your system
may actually work.
Dennis

I'll point you in the right direction to get copies of the information.

Dennis and Jim, thank you for the information and advice.

I?m familiar with the ASHRAE article that you spoke of, but not the PG&E guide.  I?ll definitely have to take a look.

My previously mentioned large, overly complex school model does indeed model all of the points you outlined.  Also, given that it is the LEED baseline, I?m trying to reduce complexity and lump as much together as possible according to the proposed design?s thermal/system zoning. But if there is one zone that is varying wildly different from the others, a separate system may be justified.  In some cases the cycling at night overcools the space to the point where it needs reheat, which seems unrealistic.  I think, however, I may be experiencing some loads issues and this is not necessarily a problem of the HVAC control.

Thanks again for the background information.

Cheers,

Up here in the True North the CaGBC established that CO sensors are standard practice hence no credit for CO sensors in parking garages regardless of the local building code.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Car Parking Ventilation Fans

I think you?ve presented a reasonable approach to an exceptional calculation, if you can establish it as reasonable that the fans would operate full-bore 24/7 otherwise. Does the garage have 24/7 access? If not, the reviewer might decide that it would be standard practice to have a time clock shut-down the fans during off-hours, and only allow credit for turning down the fans during hours of normal operation.

As a point of reference, for multifamily high-rise projects with parking garages, the Energy Star Multifamily High-Rise Simulation Guidelines- https://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/bldrs_lenders_raters/downloads/mfhr/ENERGY%20STAR%20MFHR%20Simulation%20Guidelines_Version_1%200_Rev03.pdf?f027-c6f2  (Hey look everybody, they?ve just released the Jan 2015 version!), state :

For example, reduced fan runtime from installing CO sensors in residential associated garages may be modeled using 8.4 hr/day fan runtime in Proposed Design,
compared to 24 hr/day runtime in the Baseline Building Design. If Demand Control Ventilation is modeled in the Proposed Design, the baseline ventilation CFM must be
based on the lesser of the design ventilation flow rates required by the applicable code and the actual specified flow rate.

So for that kind of parking garage application it is reasonable to claim ~65% fan reduction.

I?ve had this exceptional calculation rejected on LEED projects where the CO control is required by local code, because the reviewer stated that it is thus standard practice, and not worthy of an exceptional calculation. I always found that unreasonable, as it punishes a project that happens to have a more strict local code, where as a similar building located elsewhere could receive the credit for the same measure.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Car Parking Ventilation Fans

Dear Modellers;
I am modelling a residential building with underground car park, the car parking will be mechanically ventilated via variable speed fans using ducted ventilation system to provide an air-change rate comply with ASHRAE 62.1-2007. Pollutant sensors (PS) are connected to BMS to control fans speed at parking floors to achieve ventilation recommended by ASHRAE 62.1.
Pollutant sensors locations and numbers have been determined to ensure that no part of the car park is located more than 25 meters from a sampling point, monitoring locations selected are considered worst-case within the car park area. And that each area which is serviced by a separate ventilation system has a separate monitoring point. In addition, one sampling point is provided at each of the entrances and exits of the car park. The monitoring will take place within the breathing zone between 1 and 1.8m above the floor and more than 0.1 m from walls or air conditioning equipment.
Based on the occupancy schedule of the project, it is assumed that the number of vehicles moving in the parking area will be minimal between 8:00 pm to 8:00 am, this means that the CO levels in this period will be less than 50 ppm -given the large parking areas and small number of cars using the garage during these hours- and based on the sequence of operation for this system, the fan speed will be reduced at least 50% for 12 hour.
The sequence of operation of this system will be as the following:
a)      Less than 25ppm, fan speed will be 1.5 ACH
b)      At 25ppm, fan speed will be 3 ACH
c)       Between 25ppm to 50 ppm, Fan speed will be 3 ACH to 6 ACH
d)      At 50ppm, fan speed will be 6 ACH

Feedback CO sensors will reduce the fan speed by at least 50% for 12 hours a day and hence the energy consumption will be reduced by at least 45% a day.

My questions are:
1) a)      Does the above sounds as an exceptional calculation (For me it is not standard practice and therefore can be done as an exceptional calculation)
b)    b)f the answer is YES, can I assume the saving is 45%

I will appreciate your feedback

Thanks;

Whoops, I obviously missed in your first line that you stated the building IS residential, in which case it is probably true that there will be 24/7 garage access. So you might just want to apply the ESMFHR Sim Guidelines methodology.

I think you?ve presented a reasonable approach to an exceptional calculation, if you can establish it as reasonable that the fans would operate full-bore 24/7 otherwise. Does the garage have 24/7 access? If not, the reviewer might decide that it would be standard practice to have a time clock shut-down the fans during off-hours, and only allow credit for turning down the fans during hours of normal operation.

As a point of reference, for multifamily high-rise projects with parking garages, the Energy Star Multifamily High-Rise Simulation Guidelines- https://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/bldrs_lenders_raters/downloads/mfhr/ENERGY%20STAR%20MFHR%20Simulation%20Guidelines_Version_1%200_Rev03.pdf?f027-c6f2  (Hey look everybody, they?ve just released the Jan 2015 version!), state :

For example, reduced fan runtime from installing CO sensors in residential associated garages may be modeled using 8.4 hr/day fan runtime in Proposed Design,
compared to 24 hr/day runtime in the Baseline Building Design. If Demand Control Ventilation is modeled in the Proposed Design, the baseline ventilation CFM must be
based on the lesser of the design ventilation flow rates required by the applicable code and the actual specified flow rate.

So for that kind of parking garage application it is reasonable to claim ~65% fan reduction.

I?ve had this exceptional calculation rejected on LEED projects where the CO control is required by local code, because the reviewer stated that it is thus standard practice, and not worthy of an exceptional calculation. I always found that unreasonable, as it punishes a project that happens to have a more strict local code, where as a similar building located elsewhere could receive the credit for the same measure.

Sherif,

I?ve received credit for this energy conservation measure from LEED reviewers as an exceptional calc, but the schedule you apply to the fan needs to be well thought out.

I?ve taken 50% credit through 95% fan power savings credit depending on the operating schedule. For example, a 24 hour hospital has 3 peak usage periods per day during shift changes.

LEED reviewers will push back on this measure, and have required me to show 3 similar projects nearby that don?t have the technology installed built in the last 5 years.

Good luck on this.

That ruling seems crazy to me.  In cold climates, there is a heated make-up air system.  If you are allowed to claim 75% fan energy savings, then if follows that you would be allowed to claim 75% heating savings.  That can be huge in a large parkade.

I can?t imagine any building not using CO control in parking areas these days.  The baseline case should include CO control IMHO.

The best recent relevant interpretation I could find on http://www.usgbc.org/leed-interpretations is dated April 2, 2014 and pasted below.

LEED Interpretation ID#10371  made on 04/02/2014

Prerequisite/Credit: EAp2 - Minimum energy performance
Rating System Family: Building design + construction
Rating System Version: v3 - LEED 2009

Inquiry
Clarification is requested regarding whether garage demand control ventilation may be modeled for credit. Garage Ventilation is not addressed by ASHRAE 90.1 ? 2007, Appendix G, therefore if savings is claimed it must be modeled as an Exceptional Calculation Measure (ECM). Garage demand control ventilation is increasingly becoming standard practice in newly constructed buildings. In order to take credit for this measure as an ECM, it must be demonstrated that the proposed design goes beyond standard practice.

Ruling
ECMs must be approved by the Rating Authority. As the Rating Authority for LEED projects, the GBCI will accept an ECM for garage demand control ventilation under the following circumstances:
1) Baseline case shall meet the requirements of ASHRAE 90.1-2010, Section 6.4.3.4.5 Enclosed Parking Garage Ventilation. Baseline fan volume shall be based on the minimum required ASHRAE 62.1 parking ventilation rates of 0.75 cfm / square foot. Baseline system fan power shall be calculated at 0.3 watts per CFM.
2) Proposed case shall reflect the actual design. Evidence shall be provided documenting that demand control ventilation strategies are sufficient to automatically detect contaminant levels of concern in parking garages (Carbon Monoxide, Particulates, VOCs, etc. and NO2) and modulate airflow such that contaminant levels are maintained below specified contaminant concentration as identified in ASHRAE 62.1-2010 Addendum d. Evidence shall also be provided that contaminant sensors are placed in space in an appropriate manner for detection of contaminant in question and that the sensors be calibrated yearly.
3) If other activities occur in the garage area, the ventilation for these uses shall be in addition to garage vehicle ventilation.
4) Proposed case shall be modeled such that a minimum air flow of 0.05 cfm/square foot is maintained.
5) A narrative shall describe all Baseline and Proposed case assumptions included for this measure, and the calculation methodology used to determine the projected savings. The narrative and energy savings should be reported separately from the other efficiency measures in the LEED Form.
6) No more than a 75% fan energy savings shall be claimed for this measure.

Sherif,

I?ve received credit for this energy conservation measure from LEED reviewers as an exceptional calc, but the schedule you apply to the fan needs to be well thought out.

I?ve taken 50% credit through 95% fan power savings credit depending on the operating schedule. For example, a 24 hour hospital has 3 peak usage periods per day during shift changes.

LEED reviewers will push back on this measure, and have required me to show 3 similar projects nearby that don?t have the technology installed built in the last 5 years.

Good luck on this.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Car Parking Ventilation Fans

Dear Modellers;
I am modelling a residential building with underground car park, the car parking will be mechanically ventilated via variable speed fans using ducted ventilation system to provide an air-change rate comply with ASHRAE 62.1-2007. Pollutant sensors (PS) are connected to BMS to control fans speed at parking floors to achieve ventilation recommended by ASHRAE 62.1.
Pollutant sensors locations and numbers have been determined to ensure that no part of the car park is located more than 25 meters from a sampling point, monitoring locations selected are considered worst-case within the car park area. And that each area which is serviced by a separate ventilation system has a separate monitoring point. In addition, one sampling point is provided at each of the entrances and exits of the car park. The monitoring will take place within the breathing zone between 1 and 1.8m above the floor and more than 0.1 m from walls or air conditioning equipment.
Based on the occupancy schedule of the project, it is assumed that the number of vehicles moving in the parking area will be minimal between 8:00 pm to 8:00 am, this means that the CO levels in this period will be less than 50 ppm -given the large parking areas and small number of cars using the garage during these hours- and based on the sequence of operation for this system, the fan speed will be reduced at least 50% for 12 hour.
The sequence of operation of this system will be as the following:
a)      Less than 25ppm, fan speed will be 1.5 ACH
b)      At 25ppm, fan speed will be 3 ACH
c)       Between 25ppm to 50 ppm, Fan speed will be 3 ACH to 6 ACH
d)      At 50ppm, fan speed will be 6 ACH

Feedback CO sensors will reduce the fan speed by at least 50% for 12 hours a day and hence the energy consumption will be reduced by at least 45% a day.

My questions are:
1) a)      Does the above sounds as an exceptional calculation (For me it is not standard practice and therefore can be done as an exceptional calculation)
b)    b)f the answer is YES, can I assume the saving is 45%

I will appreciate your feedback

Thanks;

The best recent relevant interpretation I could find on http://www.usgbc.org/leed-interpretations is dated April 2, 2014 and pasted below.

LEED Interpretation ID#10371  made on 04/02/2014

Prerequisite/Credit: EAp2 - Minimum energy performance
Rating System Family: Building design + construction
Rating System Version: v3 - LEED 2009

Inquiry
Clarification is requested regarding whether garage demand control ventilation may be modeled for credit. Garage Ventilation is not addressed by ASHRAE 90.1 ? 2007, Appendix G, therefore if savings is claimed it must be modeled as an Exceptional Calculation Measure (ECM). Garage demand control ventilation is increasingly becoming standard practice in newly constructed buildings. In order to take credit for this measure as an ECM, it must be demonstrated that the proposed design goes beyond standard practice.

Ruling
ECMs must be approved by the Rating Authority. As the Rating Authority for LEED projects, the GBCI will accept an ECM for garage demand control ventilation under the following circumstances:
1) Baseline case shall meet the requirements of ASHRAE 90.1-2010, Section 6.4.3.4.5 Enclosed Parking Garage Ventilation. Baseline fan volume shall be based on the minimum required ASHRAE 62.1 parking ventilation rates of 0.75 cfm / square foot. Baseline system fan power shall be calculated at 0.3 watts per CFM.
2) Proposed case shall reflect the actual design. Evidence shall be provided documenting that demand control ventilation strategies are sufficient to automatically detect contaminant levels of concern in parking garages (Carbon Monoxide, Particulates, VOCs, etc. and NO2) and modulate airflow such that contaminant levels are maintained below specified contaminant concentration as identified in ASHRAE 62.1-2010 Addendum d. Evidence shall also be provided that contaminant sensors are placed in space in an appropriate manner for detection of contaminant in question and that the sensors be calibrated yearly.
3) If other activities occur in the garage area, the ventilation for these uses shall be in addition to garage vehicle ventilation.
4) Proposed case shall be modeled such that a minimum air flow of 0.05 cfm/square foot is maintained.
5) A narrative shall describe all Baseline and Proposed case assumptions included for this measure, and the calculation methodology used to determine the projected savings. The narrative and energy savings should be reported separately from the other efficiency measures in the LEED Form.
6) No more than a 75% fan energy savings shall be claimed for this measure.

if you haven't heard the section 179d tax deduction was retroactively 
extended from dec 31, 2013 to dec 31, 2014.

http://www.section179.org
**

*Updated Dec 19, 2014* -  It's official. *H.R. 5771: Tax Increase 
Prevention Act of 2014 (aka Tax Extenders Act)* retroactively expanding 
the Section 179 deduction limits thru 12/31/2014 has been enacted. The 
new law reinstates the limit on Section 179 to $500,000 as well as 
reinstates 50% Bonus Depreciation.

The measure was passed by the House on Dec 3, 2014, the Senate on Dec 
16, 2014, and signed into law by the President on Dec 19,2014. Click 
here for the official announcement: 
http://link.crestcapital.com/hr5771enacted

IMPORTANT NOTE> Only this 2014 tax year is covered by this measure - 
therefore it is a good business decision for many to finance equipment 
immediately to make the December 31, 2014 cutoff for the write-off 
provisions. Your business must apply for Section 179 Qualified Financing 
<http://www.crestcapital.com/section_179_bonus> as soon as possible to 
make the cut-off at midnight 12/31/2014.

Technically, the bill is a one-year, retroactive extension of the tax 
breaks, even though it only lasts through the end of the month. This 
site will be updated to reflect these changes shortly. The Section 179 
Calculator is already fully updated. Click Here for fully updated

HI

I just ran into the thread below and I am wondering why the condenser water reset temp min has not been lowered.  When chiller plants have York chillers we reset CWST down to 55?F.  It would be nice to capture/explore the chillers running as designed.   I understand that the DOE2 curves are not fit for lower CWST and  we would have to create chiller curves ...but that's life....until DOE2 produces alternate curves.

Thanks

________________________________

We are checking eQUEST to confirm the issue of MIN-COND-T, and will fix it

if it is missing.







Mike is correct that the capacity and power performance curves were not fit

for condenser temperatures below 65-70F, and the default MIN-COND-T reflects

this fact.  The reason is because the majority of chillers cannot operate

satisfactorily much below this temperature.   For many reciprocating

chilllers, the expansion valve requires a minimum pressure differential in

order to operate and deliver the rated capacity.  Centrifugal chillers may

also be limited.  Recently, we were investigating a 'frictionless'

centrifugal compressor, and learned that motor cooling would be inadequate

if the condenser temperature (and pressure) drops much below about this

value; insufficient liquid refrigerant would be injected into the motor.







If you want to investigate lower condenser temperatures, we recommend that

you inspect the capacity and eir curves in the regime of interest to confirm

whether they yield reasonable results.







The best way to use the DIAGNOSTIC NO-LIMITS override is to first debug your

input at a higher diagnostic level so that the BDL can issue errors,

warnings, cautions.  Once you are ready to run, then set NO-LIMITS.







Depending on feedback we get from people, we can reduce the lower limit of

MIN-COND-T, or change the error checking so that it issues a warning rather

than an error.  As the curves are NOT fit for temperatures lower than about

65F, the lower limit should probably remain the same, but the checking

reduced from an error to a warning.  Comments?

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Condenser Water Reset in eQuest











Hi all..I thought I would share a couple of tips on using Condenser Water

Reset Strategies in eQuest . Hopefully some of you will find this useful.



We just finished modeling a chiller plant where we looked at using low

condenser water temperatures ( below 60F ) as an energy efficiency measure.

The project is in a climate with very low wetbulb temperatures .  There are

a couple of quirks I thought I would share about trying to model a strategy

like this.



The Condenser Loop Control tab has several options for resetting the loop

temperature.  If you notice MIN-RESET-T always defaults to 70F.



Issue  #1:  If you reset the Condenser loop MIN-RESET-T lower than 70F (say

65F) and then run an hourly report to check the loop temperature everything

looks like it's working fine.  BUT..if you also check the chiller entering

condenser temperature you will find it never goes below 70F even though the

condenser loop says it should be lower.  This is because the chiller has a

keyword MIN-COND-T that defualts to 70F and cannot be changed from within

eQuest.  You have to change the keyword manually in the input file by adding

the line, MIN-COND-T = 65 underneath the definition of your chiller.





The most likely reason this defaults to 70F is because the default chiller

performance curves were not designed for condenser temperatures below 70F  (

someone should correct me if this is wrong)



If you want to try and model condenser water temperatures below 70F I highly

recommend you create custom performance curves that include data points that

describe the operation of your chiller at the appropriate condenser water

conditions.



That brings me to Issue #2.



The MIN-COND-T keyword has a lower limit of 60F.  In other words even if you

create the appropriate performance curves  and then try to set MIN-COND-T

lower than 60F you will get a simulation error.



You can work around this by using the DIAGNOSTIC keyword "NO-LIMITS".  In

effect this turns off both the Max and Min keyword limits.  You can then

simulate chiller operation with very low condesner water temperatures.



If you use the "NO-LIMITS" keyword do so very carefully.  This is a very

important error checking function of DOE2.2 eQuest.
