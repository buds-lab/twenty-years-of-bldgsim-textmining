Subject: [bldg-sim] Zone Split
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200503301434.AA343478pd80000617008@gard.com>

Hi all,

In the detailed mode of V 3.54 eQUEST, I need to split a pre-existing
zone in three
zones. Is there any way of doing this?

This zone has one space and several exterior/interior walls and window
child components. So I basically need to create three spaces with
relative components.

Is there any easier way of doing this? Ideas/suggestions?
Thanks in advance.

Kajal Mehta

Subject: [bldg-sim] DOE2.2-How to link two different systems to the same thermal zone?
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200503281846.AA4656218pd80000614462@gard.com>

The latest version of DOE-2.2 (and I assume EQuest) allows the FC and SZRH systems to have "intermittent" indoor fan operation (ie. fans do not run when the zone is in deadband).  Check out the DOE22Vol6-NewFeatures40-44.PDF document in the DOE-2.2 downloads area of DOE2.COM.

I haven't tried this new capability, but it would appear to allow exactly what you would like when combined with the OA-FROM-SYSTEM - outdoor air system on a common schedule with zone FCUs independently scheduled.  You may need to play with the outdoor air system type as different systems respond differently to the no load dummy zone.

Regards,
Graham

Thank you Mike, I agree the best way to solve the
problem is to be creative.

The building we are dealing with has a very random use
(it has university departments, research laboratories
and teachers offices), and we are trying to implement
HVAC control strategies that may be able to change
plant operation and setpoints taking into account the
actual demand of the users. When we will get a
validated model of the building, we will programme
control algorithms and try them with changing
end-users conditions.

We are thinking in modeling for example five different
fancoils so that if we want a 20% of use we will
schedule one fancoil ON, if we want a 40% of use we
will schedule two fancoils ON, ... The problem is that
the number of thermal zones will be multiplied by five
and that could affect the application performance.

Do you think it's a good idea?

Thanks in advance,
Pedro Rodrigo

I think Justins approach is the way to go in this situation.  DOE 2.2 can't model what you want to do exactly so you have to get creative.  Just remember to calibrate the model carefully and be sure the results match what you see in the field.

The newest version of equest, v3.54, has changed how the OA-FROM-SYSTEM keyword works so that OA flowrates can be based on hourly zone requirements (variable OA) rather than simply providing a fixed volume of OA.

As far as determining how to model the fan coils, try doing some data logging to create a load profile of when and how the various FC operate.  If there is a central elec panel that all the fan coils  are served from you could monitor how the load on the panel changes throughout the day.  That should give you a good indication of the percentage of fans that run at any given time.    
  

Good luck,

I have recently modeled (in eQUEST) a building with a similar situation in which laboratory zones with fume hood exhaust had a central make-up air system in addition to multiple water-loop heat pump units.  The make-up air was 100% OA and conditioned to a neutral temperature by a chilled water coil and gas furnace.  In order to simulate this I created a dummy zone, maintained at 75F supplied by the make-up air system.  The laboratory zones were specified with their own water-loop heat pumps and zone thermostats.  In the WLHP systems I specified OA-FROM-SYSTEM to come from the make-up air system with a fixed CFM because the make-up air had a constant volume supply.  This forced the WLHPs to have their fans ON at all times, so I moved the WLHP fan energy into the cooling and heating EIRs so that the fans could run for free for the OA.  In the real building, the WLHP fans run only when the compressor is running. This may not have been the best solution, but it gave pretty good results.

Perhaps you could do something similar by moving the reheat coil energy either into the central system, or into the FC systems, and using the OA-FROM-SYSTEM keyword.  As far as I know, there is no way to simulate this situation directly.  The best work-around will depend on how your systems are controlled and what ECMs you want to simulate.

In-Reply-To: <MDAEMON-F200503280538.AA3853187pd80000621969@gard.com>

I have recently modeled (in eQUEST) a building with a similar situation in which laboratory zones
with fume hood exhaust had a central make-up air system in addition to multiple water-loop heat pump
units.  The make-up air was 100% OA and conditioned to a neutral temperature by a chilled water coil
and gas furnace.  In order to simulate this I created a dummy zone, maintained at 75F supplied by
the make-up air system.  The laboratory zones were specified with their own water-loop heat pumps
and zone thermostats.  In the WLHP systems I specified OA-FROM-SYSTEM to come from the make-up air
system with a fixed CFM because the make-up air had a constant volume supply.  This forced the WLHPs
to have their fans ON at all times, so I moved the WLHP fan energy into the cooling and heating EIRs
so that the fans could run for free for the OA.  In the real building, the WLHP fans run only when
the compressor is running. This may not have been the best solution, but it gave pretty good results.

Perhaps you could do something similar by moving the reheat coil energy either into the central
system, or into the FC systems, and using the OA-FROM-SYSTEM keyword.  As far as I know, there is no
way to simulate this situation directly.  The best work-around will depend on how your systems are
controlled and what ECMs you want to simulate.

Hello all!
I belong to a team of researchers in the University of
Jaen, Spain. It would be very useful for us if you
could
tell us your opinion about a little DOE2-related
question.
We are simulating a real (yet existing) multi-zone
building in eQuest. The problem is that we have two
kinds of terminal units operating together in each
zone: i) a two-pipe air handler unit (with outside air
dampers) and ii) several two-pipe fan-coils. The AHU
provides a primary flow of 21?C set conditioned air.
Users in different rooms served by the same AHU,
operate on/off and set room temperature via the
individual fan-coils.
We have realized that it?s not possible to link two
different systems (i.e. SZR + FC) to the same thermal
zone in DOE2 (only one is allowed). How could we model
this building without increasing too much the number
of thermal zones? And how could we schedule the
operation of the individual fancoils, for example
20%-On, 40%-On, 60$-On,...? (We have up to 50 fan-coil
units working together with a single AHU).
Thanks in advance,
Regards,
Pedro Rodrigo

Hi,
I am trying to set up a PV system that  is grid tied. I have manages to set it up on the meter, and I tried to use a secondary meter (surplus meter) option with electric sale, but it doesnt seem tobe working. What am I missing? Is it possible to do this in eQUEST? Am I doing it right, but not looking at the right report for the output?
 
eUEST has not developed help file for this yet, so I was hoping I could get some guidance for this
 
Thanks

Hello:

I'm sorry for not doing this earlier, but I do not think that the
current generation of simulation programs (i.e., DOE-2, BLAST,
EnergyPlus) are capable of accounting for all the properties in at
"green roof", which include moisture transport, adsorption, desorption,
solar conversion by the plants, multispectral properties of the plant
surfaces, transpiration, evaporation, etc. 

Hence, I would be careful about the claims that one has "simulated a
green roof" with any of these programs.  

This area of study needs further work to define those properties that
have a significant impact on the heat flux into the building through the
roof. I would certainly think that the best place to start is for
someone to offer up a literature search that points to some of the areas
I've mentioned above.

I finally got around to reading this interesting paper.  It is too bad that 
someone didn't check the energy simulation results more closely.  In Table 
1, Part 6, the total for the fourth row is incorrect.

I am wondering about the assumed R-30 value for the "green roof" average 
insulation value over the entire year.  If you examine the winter heat flux 
diagrams, there difference in total flux for heating days is quite small 
between the reference and green roofs.  I think that assuming an R-30 
heating insulation value is too optimistic.

In terms of heating, cooling, and heat island effects, and $cost how would 
the green roof compare with an R-30 conventional roof with a low-emissivity 
finish?

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200503171404.AA0438421pd80000601668@gard.com>

Hello, everyone:
 
I am simulating a building with air-conditioning system and openable windows with EnergyPlus.  The air conditioning syetem opens 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The windows are often opened in April to October and left open at night. This cause high reheating energy use at summer night becasue of the site is located in a cold area.  Right now, I am considering approximate this in my simulation model.  Could somebody tell me how to set up appropriate infiltration rate to approximate this phenomenon? or any reference?
 
Any suggestion is appreciated.
 
Thanks a lot.
 
Regards,
 
Zhen

Dear BLDG_SIM users,

Would you like to share your experience of using eQUEST in designing HVAC systems? Specifically, how do the heating and cooling loads calculated with eQUEST compared with those calculated with other energy analysis program such as E+, Esp-r, etc. Maybe more practically, how do the eQUEST calculated loads compared with those "rule of thumb"?

I'm wondering whether anyone has done such kind of comparison. If there is such comparison available, could you please let me know where to find it? 

Thanks in advance,

In-Reply-To: 6667
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200503141330.AA3009281pd80000597390@gard.com>

Dear Sir:

May I say it is nice to converse with an individual in
your country able to speak freely? I am glad to see we
are now able to openly discuss things with individuals
in your area of the world once again.

As a side note, one of my best friends and colleagues
(and a fellow simulation engineer) graduated from the
University of Baghdad.

My short take from 25 years of modeling experience is
as follows:

1) Models usually remember things that spreadsheets
don't. As much effort as goes into spreadsheets, a
model usually remembers to add or subtract energy use
when changing from a baseline to Energy Conservation
Measures (ECMs). Simplistic case - when lighting
efficiency is improved, it adjusts the cooling load
down and the heating load up.

2) Models allow for more dynamics than a straight
calculation. Especially with those using 8,760 hours
of simulation, they account for building usage change,
weather change, control system changes SIMULTANEOUSLY.
Once you have built your model building, and given it
instructions how to operate, any ECM modification will
automatically be affected by any and all systems
affected by that change.

3) You can try more than one way to improve the
building's and/or systems efficiency with a model.
Assume you have a new building and you wish to
investigate if a distribute packaged HVAC or a central
plant system will be the best "bang for the buck".
Once your building model is created, you can run
either system through its paces, and compare the
operating costs of each.

4) Modeling allows building orientation changes,
window/wall system changes, system changes, central
versus distributed plant changes, and even
cogeneration/thermal storage/gas-electric options to
be evaluated on a "level playing field". And a good
simulation program will remember to add components to
systems you may forget (pumps, crankcase heaters, and
the like).

5) For MY money, models are usually easier to follow
that massive spreadsheet calculation. Model inputs are
logically ordered, so one can see what the inputs are
clearly. And they don't have to be all on one page.

Spreadsheets usually have hidden formulae and take
information from several other spreadsheets. You
REALLY have to follow the bouncing ball to keep up
with spreadsheet logic.

So that is my two cents...

Subject: Desuperheaters to recover heat from refrigerant superheat for
packaged equipment including WSHPs and GSHPs

 

Can anyone share experience with the benefits, downsides, and
cost-effectiveness of desuperheaters.

 

How about anything on analyzing/modeling the energy recovery?

 

Thanks-Brian Thornton

hi
i am a user of energy plus
someone asked me a question which was, "what makes energy simulation(in general) better than other calculation programs ?"...frankly i couldnt find a good answer for it .. i just know it is better that is all !! but could anyone tell me why it is better?....what is the mean difference between these two programs? 
thanks for helping me

Architectural Energy Corporation is pleased to announce a VisualDOE 4.0
and LEED training seminar on April 20-22, 2005 in San Francisco.

The seminar includes two days focused on DOE-2.1E, the VisualDOE
interface, VisualDOE 4.0 new features, and general energy simulation
skills. The third day covers LEED energy savings calculations for green
buildings. The LEED module covers LEED-NC 2.1 as well as proposed
calculation methods for LEED-NC 2.2.

No prior energy modeling experience is required, but a good
understanding of building systems is very helpful.

VisualDOE 4.0 is available at a discount to training attendees.  However
a free one-month license for VisualDOE 4.0 is included with the
training.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Commercial kitchen refrigeration equipment loads
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200503021740.AA4045125pd80000582763@gard.com>

Hi,

I am looking for guidelines concerning the simulation of commercial
refrigeration equipment and internal space gains.  I found  Table 5 on page
29.10 of the 2001 ASHRAE Fundamentals, but the handbook values are for a
single point in time i.e. when the equipment is actively running.  This is
good for maximum gain and system sizing, but the equipment is not going to
run at this level at all times  Does anyone have any scheduling information
(documented) that can be used to modify the maximum for use with an hourly
sim like eQuest?
