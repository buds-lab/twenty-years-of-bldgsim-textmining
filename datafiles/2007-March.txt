Hi All,

Can anyone give me some information /references on the recommended building
air conditioning indoor set point temperature for office buildings in
Tropical countries (example Thailand)?

Many thanks

Marcus,
 
I think that this approach to documenting natural ventilation within the
bounds of Appendix G is the correct one. 
 
However, there are a couple things I'd like to note for future
consideration:
 
1. If the proposed building can stay within the unmet load hours limits
without a fictitious mechanical cooling system, that should be
acceptable, provided that budget and proposed models have identical
thermostat setpoints, etc. 
 
2. As the USGBC considers project carbon savings and benchmarking of
buildings versus target finder, I would encourage a broader view on
natural ventilation and other strategies and the modeling process. In my
opinion, for this type of comparison the building should be modeled
exactly as it is to be built and operated - i.e. don't include
fictitious mechanical systems that are not installed or other such
deviations from the as-built condition. We already run this type of
model for owners so they can see what they are really going to expect
for energy savings and indoor conditions and I suspect that others do
the same.
 
Thanks for the good news.

FYI a new CIR has been posted on the USGBC web site regarding natural
ventilation systems and LEED projects.  The text is below.  Please
consider this just a starting point and general guidance for projects
that are similar to the one described.  We welcome feedback.
 
3/22/2007 - 
Credit Interpretation Request
Our project consists of two small buildings close to the ocean that will
achieve substantial energy savings by incorporating a natural
ventilation strategy. No mechanical heating or cooling is intended for
either building, with the exception of a small electrical/server room. 

The building is designed with a very narrow and long floor plate
situated perpendicular to prevailing winds in the area. Ventilation
openings are consistent with the requirements of ASHRAE 62.1-2004
Section 6.8. The project also meets the requirements outlined in the
CIBSE Applications Manual 10: 2005 as referenced in EQc2 for Natural
ventilation in non-domestic buildings. Per Title-24 2005 requirements
for natural ventilation, the sum of operable windows will be greater
than 5% of the floor area of each space that is naturally ventilated.
The openings will also be readily accessible to the occupants of each
space at all times. Outdoor airflow through the openings in regularly
occupied spaces will come directly from the outdoors, not through
intermediate spaces such as other occupied spaces or corridors. Openings
include operable windows, through-the roof ventilators, and vents
between interior spaces. Control mechanisms for the natural ventilation
openings are manual. A long, tall hallway situated perpendicular to the
prevailing winds will collect heated air and exhaust it the outside. The
roof over much of the space is sloped allowing air to enter on the low
side and exit on the high side. In all cases, the building is designed
to facilitate cross-ventilation with windows low on the walls for
drawing the air in, and windows and vents high in opposite walls or on
the roof to draw air out. Under ASHRAE 55 definitions, the building
spaces are defined as "naturally conditioned spaces, occupant
controlled" where the thermal conditions of the spaces are regulated
primarily by the opening and closing of windows or vents by the
occupants. Since the building will have a limited number of occupants
most of the time, manual control of the windows and vents has been
determined the most appropriate strategy for the building to allow
control over individual thermal comfort. As indicated by ASHRAE 55-2004,
section 5.3, the occupants of the space will be engaged in near
sedentary activities with metabolic rates ranging from 1.0 met to 1.3
met. The mean monthly outdoor temperature for the project is greater
than 50 deg. F, and less than 92.3 deg. F all months of the year, as
required under ASHRAE 55-2004, section 5.3 for naturally ventilated
buildings. 

The User's Manual for ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G states on page G-21:
The proposed building default cooling system does not exclude natural
ventilation from consideration. It just means that the proposed building
is modeled as a hybrid system where cooling is provided by natural
ventilation when conditions are acceptable and by the default mechanical
cooling system when natural ventilation is inadequate to provide thermal
comfort. We are requesting confirmation that the following modeling
strategy conforms to the requirements of ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G
modeling protocol:

1. EnergyPlus will be used to model the building since the EnergyPlus
software has the capability to evaluate energy and comfort parameters
tied to natural ventilation.

2. The Exceptional Calculation Methodology will be applied to calculate
the natural ventilation savings.

3. The Proposed Design model will be developed to reflect the design
parameters for the envelope and lighting. Operable windows will be
modeled as fixed, and vents will not be included in the model.
Mechanical systems will be modeled identically to the default heating,
cooling and fan systems in the Baseline case, except that fans in the
proposed case will be modeled as cycling on and off to meet heating and
cooling loads during all hours in the proposed case, and will operate
continuously during occupied hours in the Baseline Case (per the
exception shown in Table G3.1.4).

4. Using the Exceptional Calculation Methodology, The Proposed Design
case will be modified to include natural ventilation for all hours when
the cooling and heating loads can be met. Operable windows and vents
will be modeled as designed. Cooling and heating setpoint temperatures
will be identical to those in the Baseline Case. Schedules will be
adjusted to switch on mechanical cooling during hours when natural
ventilation alone cannot meet the space temperature setpoints. The final
model will meet the ASHRAE G3.1.2.2 requirements stipulating that the
Proposed Design cannot exceed the Baseline Design unmet load hours by
more than 50, and that unmet load hours for the Proposed Design and
Baseline Design cannot exceed 300. 

5. (Plan B) If the hybrid system cannot be manipulated to meet the unmet
load hour requirements within the energy model, hourly output data from
a natural ventilation model (having no mechanical cooling) and the
Proposed Design model will be combined in a spreadsheet. Each hour where
cooling and heating setpoints are met in the natural ventilation model,
the hourly results for that model will be used. For all other hours, the
hourly results from the Proposed Design Model will be used.

6. An Exceptional Calculation Methodology narrative provided with the
EAc1 submittal will document any schedule adjustments and assumptions
that were made to develop the hybrid system. The savings will also be
included as a separate line item on the EAc1 submittal.

Is our proposed energy modeling strategy for natural ventilation
acceptable?
 
 
3/22/2007 - 
Ruling
The project is requesting approval for the method of modeling natural
ventilation as an energy efficiency measure and for taking credit under
EA credit 1. 

Submittals for natural ventilation savings will be evaluated on a case
by case basis. 

The tools and analysis protocol proposed is acceptable for modeling
ventilation savings in this instance. Other analysis tools may also be
appropriate.

To be able to adequately document the process and the results, please be
sure to provide in the LEED submittal the following: 

* A detailed project description 
* Clear identification of the areas that are taking credit for natural
ventilation
* A detailed description or references that document the modeling
algorithms and/or methodology for the natural ventilation portion of the
energy model
* All thermostat, fan, infiltration and other appropriate schedules for
naturally ventilated areas

Also, the submitted evaluation must demonstrate that the range of unmet
load hours is similar for both the proposed and baseline building, to
ensure that savings are not claimed for hours outside of the control
parameters. In this case, the project has proposed to meet these peak
loads with a hypothetical cooling system in the proposed building.

The project will also need to clearly demonstrate that the operational
schedule for the natural ventilation system as modeled aligns with
anticipated occupant behavior in terms of scheduled occupancy vs.
modeled operation. For example, the model cannot assume that natural
ventilation will occur when no one is in the building to operate the
system.

Because manual control is not addressed by the Appendix G modeling
methodology, the manual control features of this project must be
submitted under the exceptional calculation methodology for case by case
review. The project must be prepared to demonstrate convincingly that a
manual control strategy is appropriate and workable for this project.

Please also be sure to take credit for this measure as a separate item
on the LEED-NC v2.2 Submittal Template.

The building is designed with a very narrow and long floor plate situated

consistent with the requirements of ASHRAE 62.1-2004 Section 6.8. The
project also meets the requirements outlined in the CIBSE Applications

floor area of each space that is naturally ventilated. The openings will
also be readily accessible to the occupants of each space at all times.
Outdoor airflow through the openings in regularly occupied spaces will come

occupied spaces or corridors. Openings include operable windows, through-the
roof ventilators, and vents between interior spaces. Control mechanisms for
the natural ventilation openings are manual. A long, tall hallway situated
perpendicular to the prevailing winds will collect heated air and exhaust it
the outside. The roof over much of the space is sloped allowing air to enter
on the low side and exit on the high side. In all cases, the building is
designed to facilitate cross-ventilation with windows low on the walls for
drawing the air in, and windows and vents high in opposite walls or on the
roof to draw air out. Under ASHRAE 55 definitions, the building spaces are
defined as "naturally conditioned spaces, occupant controlled" where the
thermal conditions of the spaces are regulated primarily by the opening and
closing of windows or vents by the occupants. Since the building will have a
limited number of occupants most of the time, manual control of the windows
and vents has been determined the most appropriate strategy for the building
to allow control over individual thermal comfort. As indicated by ASHRAE
55-2004, section 5.3, the occupants of the space will be engaged in near
sedentary activities with metabolic rates ranging from 1.0 met to 1.3 met.
The mean monthly outdoor temperature for the project is greater than 50 deg.
F, and less than 92.3 deg. F all months of the year, as required under

parameters for the envelope and lighting. Operable windows will be modeled
as fixed, and vents will not be included in the model. Mechanical systems
will be modeled identically to the default heating, cooling and fan systems
in the Baseline case, except that fans in the proposed case will be modeled
as cycling on and off to meet heating and cooling loads during all hours in
the proposed case, and will operate continuously during occupied hours in
the Baseline Case (per the exception shown in Table G3.1.4).

4. Using the Exceptional Calculation Methodology, The Proposed Design case
will be modified to include natural ventilation for all hours when the
cooling and heating loads can be met. Operable windows and vents will be
modeled as designed. Cooling and heating setpoint temperatures will be
identical to those in the Baseline Case. Schedules will be adjusted to
switch on mechanical cooling during hours when natural ventilation alone
cannot meet the space temperature setpoints. The final model will meet the
ASHRAE G3.1.2.2 requirements stipulating that the Proposed Design cannot
exceed the Baseline Design unmet load hours by more than 50, and that unmet
load hours for the Proposed Design and Baseline Design cannot exceed 300. 

5. (Plan B) If the hybrid system cannot be manipulated to meet the unmet
load hour requirements within the energy model, hourly output data from a
natural ventilation model (having no mechanical cooling) and the Proposed
Design model will be combined in a spreadsheet. Each hour where cooling and
heating setpoints are met in the natural ventilation model, the hourly
results for that model will be used. For all other hours, the hourly results
from the Proposed Design Model will be used.

6. An Exceptional Calculation Methodology narrative provided with the EAc1
submittal will document any schedule adjustments and assumptions that were
made to develop the hybrid system. The savings will also be included as a
separate line item on the EAc1 submittal.

Is our proposed energy modeling strategy for natural ventilation acceptable?

 
 

3/22/2007 - 
Ruling
The project is requesting approval for the method of modeling natural
ventilation as an energy efficiency measure and for taking credit under EA
credit 1. 

Submittals for natural ventilation savings will be evaluated on a case by
case basis. 

The tools and analysis protocol proposed is acceptable for modeling
ventilation savings in this instance. Other analysis tools may also be
appropriate.

To be able to adequately document the process and the results, please be
sure to provide in the LEED submittal the following: 

. A detailed project description 
. Clear identification of the areas that are taking credit for natural
ventilation
. A detailed description or references that document the modeling algorithms
and/or methodology for the natural ventilation portion of the energy model
. All thermostat, fan, infiltration and other appropriate schedules for
naturally ventilated areas

Also, the submitted evaluation must demonstrate that the range of unmet load
hours is similar for both the proposed and baseline building, to ensure that
savings are not claimed for hours outside of the control parameters. In this
case, the project has proposed to meet these peak loads with a hypothetical
cooling system in the proposed building.

The project will also need to clearly demonstrate that the operational
schedule for the natural ventilation system as modeled aligns with
anticipated occupant behavior in terms of scheduled occupancy vs. modeled
operation. For example, the model cannot assume that natural ventilation
will occur when no one is in the building to operate the system.

Because manual control is not addressed by the Appendix G modeling
methodology, the manual control features of this project must be submitted
under the exceptional calculation methodology for case by case review. The
project must be prepared to demonstrate convincingly that a manual control
strategy is appropriate and workable for this project.

Please also be sure to take credit for this measure as a separate item on
the LEED-NC v2.2 Submittal Template.

Hi,

I have two questions about BPS calibration. In literature almost all
methodology on calibration is about to calibrate BPS with actual/measured
data or utility bills of real building. On the other hand, recently there
are many disscussions and researches are held on using/integrating BPS in
early design scheme analysis. Now my question is; during this
early/schematic phase of design, with very limited information about the
future building, how can we calibrate BPS to simulate our unique design?
During the early design phase we have almost no idea about the final project
of the building because it is still under-design.

The other question is; For sensitivity analysis of a representative box
model (with only 4 zones) is it necessary to calibrate BPS? If so, the first
question is idem..The box model represents an early design scheme of a
building and the aim is to reveal the effective parameters on energy
consumption of the model by sensitivity analysis...

Anyway, If any of you have an idea, it will be appreciated.....

Thanks in advance...

Kevin,

Don't know about mouseless, but to get the 3D display back, click out of
"Building Shell" on the toolbar, to say "Waterside HVAC".  Then click
back to "Building Shell", click on the 3D tab, then right-click in the

should do it...

BTW, thx for the printer tip, I think I've got it figured...

Ah evenings, who needs to go home to a family when you have eQuest to
keep you eternally occupied?  
 
Another inscrutable eQuest annoyance... we have new Dell engineering
workstations with identical (and I do mean identical) installations of
eQuest 3.60 and Adobe Acrobat 6.0 professional.  On some machines the
color reports print out unaccountably grayscaled, on others they print
as expected.
 
The apparent difference I can see in the two installations is the video
card -- the IT guys to save a few bucks bought some machines with cheap
Intel video cards, and these seem to be the ones with the problem.  Now
the reports DISPLAY just fine in color, it's just that when printed they
degrade to grayscale.
 
Does anyone know if a shortage of video card memory might be the problem
here?  In my computer experience it doesn't sound quite right, but the
cheap video cards are the only common denominator I can find among the
problematic machines.
 
 
Cheers...

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200703281918.AA1821109pd80001395882@gard.com>

Bridgette:
 
Regarding the difference among PVVT, PVAVS, and the PSZ systems, please refer the DOE-2.2 manual Volume 3: Topics ( http://doe2.com/download/DOE-22/DOE22Vol3-Topics.pdf).
 
Basically, the difference among these three systems is the way to control supply airflow and temperature in response to varied heating and cooling loads. Starting from version 44d3 of DOE-2.2 (eQUEST version 3.6), these three systems can all be used to simulate the airside of the water-to-air heat pumps that attach to a WLHP water loop. If you use wizard to create a GSHP system, the airside system is PVVT with a set of defaults for WLHP application. These defaults include: MIN-FLOW-RATIO = 1 for fan; CONDENSER-TYPE = WATER-COOLED, which is attached to a WLHP water loop; HEAT-SOURCE = HEAT-PUMP.  Consequently, the default performance curves are those for representative GSHP. With PVVT system, eQUEST/DOE-2.2 has more flexibility to simulate WLHP system, such as the water-to-air heat pump with staged capacity and airflow, DOAS with combination of ERV and water-to-air heat pump.
 
In the detailed mode, you can build a GSHP system with airside to be PVVT, PVAVS, or PSZ. But, keep in mind, you need manually change the corresponding parameters as discussed above. If you tend to use PVAVS system as the airside of WLHP (though it is unusual), you'd be cautious about the MIN-FLOW-RATIO. It should be lower than 1 to avoid overcooling the space.
 
Hope it helps,
 
Xiaobing

Hello - 
 
in eQUEST, I understand that using a gshp is easy with the wizard, but I am now using the detailed edit mode and it is not as simple.  I have created the water loop and the hvac system that goes along with it, but what "system type" is appropriate to simulate a gshp?  The default option is a packaged var vol var temp unit - but the users manuals specify that PVVT, PVAVS, and PSZ systems can be used.  What is the difference between these three types, and could the "water loop" heat pump work?
 
Thanks!

Have not modeled a DSF with natural ventilation but may be possible in EnergyPlus.  You would have to create a separate zone as the double skin and use their bulk airflow modeling capabilities to do this.  Also read the article by Dr. Karl Gertis from an email I received previously.  This should get you started.  Germany it would seem would be the best place to look for buildings having a Nat Vent DSF.  Good luck

[I'm concerned about insect screens affecting the buoyancy driven airflow for a double skin fa?ade.]

 

Dr. Karl Gertis (director of the Fraunhofer Institute of Building Physics in Stuttgart, Germany) provides a critical review of double-skin fa?ades in one of his article and cites some problems in the literature regarding research related to Glass Double Facade e.g. "window insect screens cannot be used with natural ventilation because the airflow is too weak to overcome the pressure loss over the air filter."

This paper provides a procedure for determining ventilation rates based on the Vickery algorithm (1983), however, assumption inherent in this procedure is that there is no stack effect.

On pp 304 Section 15.8 Givoni discusses the effect of fly-screens on ventilation. He quotes van Straaten, the decrease in total airflow, caused by a 16 mesh, 30 gauge wire screen is about 60% and 50% when the wind speeds are respectively 1.5 and 2 mph and only about 25% when the wind speed is 10 mph.

In the section 'coefficients of interest' the author discusses velocity, contraction, discharge, and resistance coefficients and may provide insight into the effect of insect screen on airflow, however, the author does not directly relate it to the insect screen.

 

There is a gap in the computation of natural ventilation research especially in terms of discharge coefficients and pressure loss coefficients as Ansyley (1999) and Linden (1999) point out that the computation of natural ventilation lacks experimental data and borrows the discharge coefficient and flow resistance of openings derived from data traditionally used for fluid flow in pipes and resistance values traditionally used in computation of mine ventilation.

For a core and shell building does 90.1-2004 Section 9.4.1.2(b) 
apply?  The floor is wide open until tenant improvements and the only 
switching is at the electrical panel.  Does there need to be manual 
switches visible to occupants for the purposes of C&S?

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200703281130.AA3048484pd80001395462@gard.com>

Hello - 
 
in eQUEST, I understand that using a gshp is easy with the wizard, but I
am now using the detailed edit mode and it is not as simple.  I have
created the water loop and the hvac system that goes along with it, but
what "system type" is appropriate to simulate a gshp?  The default
option is a packaged var vol var temp unit - but the users manuals
specify that PVVT, PVAVS, and PSZ systems can be used.  What is the
difference between these three types, and could the "water loop" heat
pump work?
 
Thanks!

Has anyone modeled a building with a double-skin facade with natural
ventilation?  Any pointers would be greatly appreciated.  Also, personal
experiences or references that indicate the effectiveness of this type
of system in a northern climate would be helpful too.

 

Thanks in advance!

just add it in the input file and it will work? Any thoughts

Additional capabilities for PSZ system:


3.    To enable control of maximum humidity and use compressor superheat
for reheat, insert MAXIMUM-HUMIDITY (60% is allowed) and also
MAX-COND-RCVRY (0.5 is typical) in the SYSTEM keyword list. Note that
REHEAT-DELTA-T must also be specified.  [12]

Yes, in fact in Trace 700 there are default schedules for schools
(elementary, middle and high school if memory serves me). You can also
set up schedules for equipment, lights, people, ventilation, etc. and
this can take into account low occupancy for summer months. If you want
to schedule school vacations properly, you would need to do 8,760
analysis (not the default but it can be done) to pick a schedule that
mimics the week of in April for instance.

Hi,

I am using eQuest v3.6  for a project and at this moment the project is in
the DD wizard mode. I have defined the custom footprint shape and custom
zones by loading an AutoCAD file. Now, whenever I open the project it loads
the BDL input file and another window pops up along with it which reads as
below:





vtkOutputWindow



ERROR: In E:\vtk2.3\Nightly\vtk\common\vtkPolygon.cxx. line 1172

vtkPolygon (0x1DB1A818): Possible triangulation failure



ERROR: In E:\vtk2.3\Nightly\vtk\common\vtkPolygon.cxx. line 1172

vtkPolygon (0x1DB1A818): Possible triangulation failure

ERROR: In E:\vtk2.3\Nightly\vtk\common \vtkPolygon.cxx. line 1172

vtkPolygon (0x1DB1A818): Possible triangulation failure





I tried redoing the building footprint and zones, but this appears again.
Has anyone experienced this before? Will this cause any other problems, when
in detail mode? Any input would be greatly appreciated.



Thanks

Hello all,

1. Can we model Radiant floor heating with eQuest? If it can, can some body
please outline the method.

2. Also, how do you model evaporative cooling efficiently? My attempts
result in high electric cost due to high fan cfm that maintain the hour
outside the throttle range below 3%.

Any information is appreciated. Thanks

I received an email from Jeff Hirsch.  DOE2.1e does not support two 
hydronic loops.  The heat pump loop is a separate loop even when 
using FROM-PLANT.  Therefore you can't also have hydronic baseboards 
or a hydronic make-up air system.  One would need to use 
DOE2.2.  Apparently it is time for me to climb that learning curve.

I am modelling an HP system using the heating and cooling

baseboards.  DOESIM crashes.  If I use electric baseboards it runs 
fine.  I am using DOE-2.1En136 from DOE2.com.

It seems as though eQUEST was only approved for 2001 Title 24 for
Non-residential.  Are there plans to submit eQUEST for approval for 2005
Residential compliance?  The program seems to have the capability to

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200703221129.AA2911671pd80001392722@gard.com>

Sangeetha
 
As someone who spent a man month or so last July and August working with
a complex multi-use facility, detailing it up in Autodesk Building
Systems 2006 using the espace feature, exporting to gbXML and running
the output through Greenbuilding studio (GBS), I can tell you the
resulting model did not meet my expectations for simplicity of analysis.
Many of the most fundamental issues were in the AutoCAD to gbXML export
process, however there are other issues related to the differences
between the model created by GBS and a comparable one resulting from the
eQuest design development wizard. 
 
Models prepared by the alternate paths are not interchangeable; the GBS
model can only be edited going forward by the detailed editor. If you're
an expert at the detailed editor and manipulating .inp and other files
with a text editor, you may not find this disadvantageous.  However we
found that going back over the model and establishing all of the shell,
space, polygon, zone, system, schedule and many other relationships that
would otherwise have been set up by the eQuest wizard cost more time
going forward than was saved up-front -- for example, using the eQuest
DD wizard to add windows, doors, or skylights and set up daylighting is
more efficient than doing it in detailed edit mode, but wizard editing
is unavailable to the GBS model.  And I might add that adding windows
and doors in the eQuest DD wizard is also much easier than doing it in
ABS.
 
Perhaps GBS interoperability improvements have been made in the interim;
John Kennedy at Greenbuilding studio may be able provide current status,
There may also have been improvements to the gbXML export in ABS/ADT
2007 and Revit or the soon-to-be released ABS 2008, however I haven't
been keeping up since we're standardized on ABS 2006 for at least a
couple of years.   
 
I think the gbXML interoperability process shows great progress and
promise, and I hope the implementation kinks we observed last summer
either have been or are the process of being worked out soon.

Hi,
Has anybody had experience using Green Building Studio for energy
analysis. Can you please clarify on the reliability of a GBXML
translation of a BIM model. Is the process as easy as it seems? It is a
huge leap forward to have a BIM model coverted into an input file for
energy analysis in literally minutes.  Although, there must be some
advantages in having an energy analyst do take offs from a design
instead of depending entirely on a program that translates the BIM
model. Any inputs that will help me understand GBXML better will be
greatly appreciated.
Thanks a lot

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] USGBC response on questions about process loads for LEED 2.2
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200703221109.AA0934390pd80001392699@gard.com>

The USGBC responded to a CIR submitted through our local LEED Consultant,
Brightworks, and Gwen Fuertes of the USGBC OK'd posting this to BLDG-SIM.
Replies are interspersed in the questions as USGBC Response, in yellow
highlight, but the yellow may not survive BLDG-SIM posting.  USGBC had not
confirmed if this would be posted as a CIR ruling.  For specific projects,
you may still want to get separate rulings if still unsure, or don't like
the impact of the responses on your project. .    

 

 

RE       EAc1 Process Loads Rules for LEED NC 2.2

DT       7 March 2007

 

There is a lot of uncertainty about the handling of EAc1 process loads under
LEED 2.2.  An all-day intermittent dialogue on BLDG-SIM, the energy user's
group, resulted in more questions and no consensus on how to handle the
following provisions in the Reference Guide.  The dialogue also did not show
that anyone had received a ruling.  We request clarification on the
questions listed below, and suggest that an administrative ruling be issued
to clarify this for the whole analyst community. 

 

"The default process energy cost is 25% of the total energy cost for the
Baseline building. For buildings where the process energy cost is less than
25% of the baseline building energy cost, the LEED submittal must include
supporting documentation substantiating that process energy inputs are
appropriate. "
...
"For EA Credit 1, process loads shall be identical for both the Baseline
building performance rating and for the Proposed building performance
rating. However, project teams may follow the Exceptional Calculation Method
(ASHRAE 90.1-2004 G2.5) to document measures that reduce process loads.
Documentation of process load energy savings shall include a list of the
assumptions made for both the base and proposed design, and theoretical or
empirical information supporting these assumptions. "

 

A series of questions resulted some of which are more clear than others, but
again did not have consensus understanding.

 

1)  To model the HVAC load for a project, all process loads must also be
modeled.  Under the modeling rules for NC 2.1 projects, all loads are
modeled and the process loads (non-regulated loads) are broken out of the
final reported energy and energy costs.  For all NC 2.2 projects, what
process loads get modeled apart from what process energy and energy cost
gets reported?  Should all process loads be modeled equivalent to the method
for modeling all non-regulated loads for NC 2.1 projects, regardless of the
25% default?

 

USGBC Staff response: All process loads get modeled. If the actual process
load is less than 25%, use the default (25%) or explain the actual load in
more detail. If the actual process load is more than 25%, use the actual
percentage.

 

2)  For all projects, is the reported process energy cost adjusted to reach
25% of baseline energy cost?  Is this adjusted to the same process energy
cost value for both the baseline and design if one of the two exceptions
listed in question 3 are not met?

 

USGBC Staff response: No; the reported process energy cost is not adjusted.

 

3)  Please confirm our understanding that two exceptions apply to 2), 1. as
noted, it is possible to model and report less than 25% of budget energy
cost for process in both the baseline and design, with design documentation,
and 2. the design may have lower process energy modeled and reported for
energy cost saving Exceptional Calculations. 

 

USGBC Staff response: For exception #1, it is possible to model and report
less than 25% of budget energy cost for process if this is justified and
explained fully.

 

4)  For projects with process energy loads that exceed 25% of baseline
energy cost due to design (such as lab buildings with high process loads),
do the energy and energy cost reported get reduced to be consistent with 25%
of the baseline energy cost while modeling the actual process energy uses?
Does the reduction to 25% of baseline energy cost apply to just the baseline
as some suggested, or to both the baseline and design if at all?  

 

USGBC Staff response: Process energy loads that exceed 25% of baseline
energy cost do not get reduced to 25%; project teams should use that energy
cost percentage for the model.

 

Thank you.

In-Reply-To: <MDAEMON-F200703211657.AA5759234pd80002779525@gard.com>

Xiaobing,

There are at least 2 issues here:

1) TMYs are selected to be representative of long term conditions and 
are generally used for energy calculations, not sizing.  In theory, 
the TMY year has about the same overall distribution of some combined 
statistic as does the 30 year record.  However, that does not 
guarantee representative distribution of dry-bulb temperature, 
coincident dry-bulb / wet-bulb, etc.  There is probably an OK match, 
but to my knowledge there has not been a systematic study of how good 
the match is.  So there is a risk.

2) A completely separate issue is use of real day sequences for loads 
calcs.  ASHRAE loads methods (Heat Balance, RTS) simulate the design 
day over and over.  Thus the design condition is equivalent of a long 
sequence of hot, sunny days with the building fully occupied.  No 
cooler days, no weekends.  Depending on the climate and the building, 
a real day sequence simulation will predict lower peaks, often much 
lower.  If the right sequence is used, this result might be more 
realistic.  But selecting the right sequence is tricky.  For the 
present, the conservative approach is to avoid the problem and repeat 
the design day.

TC 4.2 has sponsored research to support a possible transition to 
real-sequence design procedures --


Colliver et al.  1998.  Sequences of Extreme Temperature and Humidity 
for Design Calculations.  828-RP.  This project produced the "

Design Weather Sequence Viewer" CD-ROM available from the ASHRAE bookstore.


Klein and

Reindl.  2000.

Automated Generation of Hourly Design Sequences.  962-RP.   This 
project produced "EXTREMES: Weather Sequence Generator" CD-ROM 
available from the ASHRAE bookstore.

These projects may have been a bit ahead of their time.  As 
simulation becomes more mainstream, real-sequence loads calcs may 
move into practice.  A very interesting project would be a comparison 
of equipment sizing results using traditional design-days, TMYs, and 
synthetic sequences (e.g. EXTREMES), and real sequences.

Renee,
 
I haven't had a chance to use the Title 24 Code Compliance feature in eQuest yet but my experience is based on using the Savings by Design compliance tool. 
 
The code compliance analysis runs your original model through a rule-set that re-writes the input file creating both a baseline model file and a new proposed model file.  The new models are based on your original model and the parameters of the Code Compliance Rule Set.  The Tool will overwrite any user inputs that do not fit within the pre-defined rule-set.  The purpose I think is to avoid gaming and to ensure the integrity of the data inputs in both the baseline and as-designed models. 
 
Volume 5 of the DOE2.2 documentation describes in detail how the Compliance Analysis Tool works.  It may not answer all your question but it should help you understand what the Analysis tool is doing.

	Greetings,
	 
	For those who have used the Title 24 analysis in eQuest for California projects, I know it hasn't been officially approved yet but by the time our building will be fully designed I am hoping that it will be. Anyone know the latest on this approval process?
	 
	Also, during early design stages, we typically run a Base Case (code complaint model), a Design Case (proposed design), and EEMs (energy efficiency measures) on top of the Design Case to determine savings individually from each EEM.
	 
	When we run the Title 24 analysis, a T24 Standard model  is created  which is great so we don't have to input all the data ourselves. However it also creates a T24  Proposed Design model.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200703220900.AA0017796pd80001392512@gard.com>

Greetings,
 
For those who have used the Title 24 analysis in eQuest for California projects, I know it hasn't been officially approved yet but by the time our building will be fully designed I am hoping that it will be. Anyone know the latest on this approval process?
 
Also, during early design stages, we typically run a Base Case (code complaint model), a Design Case (proposed design), and EEMs (energy efficiency measures) on top of the Design Case to determine savings individually from each EEM.
 
When we run the Title 24 analysis, a T24 Standard model  is created  which is great so we don't have to input all the data ourselves. However it also creates a T24  Proposed Design model. Obviously the T24 Standard model is our new Base Case.  However, the T24 Proposed model is sometimes quite different than our  original Design Case.   Does anyone know why the simulation changes our Design Case to make the energy usage different?
 
Also, we had trouble with the daylighting simulations in  adding daylighitng to the Proposed T24 design  case. I'm assuming it is correct to model the EEMs on top of the T24 Proposed Design? But how do we get around the daylight modeling part?

That's an interesting question. I believe you'll find some useful ASHRAE papers on this topic by such authors as Sandy Klein, Dru Crawlay, Don Colliver and others. AHSRAE's TC 4.2 committee has also studied this. However, most of these consider statistics of peak or extreme weather conditions. I do not recall any papers that considered uncertainty of equipment sizing.

TMY files comprise average months selected from, in most cases, 30 years of
data. Thus they will tend not to reflect outlying conditions that you may
want to anticipate in your design.

Dear Xiaobing:

Be aware that Typical Meteorological Years (TMY) data is based on
weather data typical for a 30 year period (1961-1990 NSRDB). 

HVAC equipment is sized based on meeting design conditions (ASHRAE 55)
within a percentile at extreme weather conditions.

There is someone here who has developed a BIM (by Autodesk) input interface to DOE2.1E and eQUEST.  He has developed procedures that can convert scanned drawings & pictures of buildings and create a BIM model.  It may not be ready for commercial use and the engineering systems and plant components may be weak.  
Regarding my last post on converting DOE2 "*.bin" weather files to tables and charts, it is also possible to take the hourly Fortran variable output from DOE2.1E (or VisualDOE) and eQUEST (or DOE2.2), transfer it to an Excel file, and program it in Excel/VB to perform additional analysis.  There will be a eQUEST (May 21-22) and VisualDOE (May 23-24) training seminar at IIT.  The announcement with instructions for on-line registrations with credit payments will be posted soon.  The contact is Caroline Morais.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200703211321.AA2153390pd80001391903@gard.com>

For HIR you want the design fuel input and usable heat output, you won't
want to compare it to any measure of efficiency over time.  HIR = 1.67
is more like boiling water in a pot over an open fire.  Keep trying the
manufacturer for a design fuel input rate.  Energy factor is based on
using 64 gallons DHW per day and includes standby losses.
 
http://www.aceee.org/consumerguide/topwater.htm
 
HIR applies to many types of equipment where a storage tank (and losses)
may or may not be part of the system.  As you suggest, the tank losses
can be treated separately.
 
Also, if you make an edit to the HIR, then it will appear in the input
file.  Many items that are left to eQuest defaults will not appear in
the input file unless the default is overridden.
 
Hope this helps!
 
David

usage, supply temp, input rating, etc.
	 
	If you click on the DHW icon under the water-side HVAC tab you
will see a default HIR number under "equipment eficiency" for the tank,
it seems always to be 1.37 (~73% efficiency).  Oddly, this number does
not appear in the input file. though you can change it in Parametric
Runs to examine different DHW efficiencies. Question: 
	 
	-Gas water heaters are typically rated with an EF, and Energy
Factor, essentially an efficiency rating.  However, this number is
usually between .5 and .7, with most being around .6--(This would
translate to an HIR of 1.67).  
	Does anyone know the relationship b/w eQuest's HIR and actual
models EF?  In order to compare different models of water heaters,
should I make this HIR equal to the EF of the current model and then
chane the number for newer more efficent models? Or I wonder if the
manufacturer-rated EF includes standby/tank UA losses and that is why it
is lower than the HIR in eQuest, wh/ is separate from the standby loss
calc. 
	 
	Any thoughts/experience would be great..

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200703211257.AA5759468pd80001391848@gard.com>

Utilizng eQuest, under the DHW Equipment tab in wizard mode, the user can
enter the usual characteristics: storage capacity, hot water usage, supply
temp, input rating, etc.

If you click on the DHW icon under the water-side HVAC tab you will see a
default HIR number under "equipment eficiency" for the tank, it seems always
to be 1.37 (~73% efficiency).  Oddly, this number does not appear in the
input file. though you can change it in Parametric Runs to examine different
DHW efficiencies. Question:

Hi,
  Has anybody had experience using Green Building Studio for energy analysis. Can you please clarify on the reliability of a GBXML translation of a BIM model. Is the process as easy as it seems? It is a huge leap forward to have a BIM model coverted into an input file for energy analysis in literally minutes.  Although, there must be some advantages in having an energy analyst do take offs from a design instead of depending entirely on a program that translates the BIM model. Any inputs that will help me understand GBXML better will be greatly appreciated.
  Thanks a lot

Mich,

Here is the URL for UAE weather from Energy Plus.

Hello everyone,

Does anyone know where I could find a climatic data for DUBAI, UAE? I
have 
looked into the DOE2 website for weather locations and in the Middle
East; 
they only have for Kuwait and Saudia Arabia.

Also, where can you find thermal insulation materials costs? per

I have looked everywhere in the net and could not find any.


Appreciate it alot!

Micha---

A good resource for basic insulation costs is the RS Means series of
books, and the Building Construction Cost Data for your question in
particular.
(http://www.amazon.com/Building-Construction-Cost-Data-Means/dp/08762978
66/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-2805651-5885766?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1174494514&sr=1-
1)

You might be able to find a copy at the library or a
consulting/contracting firm will have a copy.

For Dubai weather, the best resource I could find was on the US Dept of
Energy website through EnergyPlus.  They offer real time climatic data,
including Dubai and Abu Dhabi.  I haven't tried to convert the text file
they send to a TMY2 file but it may be possible.  Here is the link:

Using it a 3 bedroom 2,000 square foot house would have a total daily internal gain of 77,812 BTU which would be equivalent to 22.8 kWh a day (assuming its all electric).

eQuest version 3.61 has significantly improved the way eQuest deals with
skylights.  I suggest you go to the DOE2.2 website and make sure you
download the latest version.
 
The new version allows you to define a window as a standard window, flat
skylight, domed skylight or tubular daylighting device.  If you open the
DOE2 help file from within eQuest 3.61 and go to Vol6: New Features you
can find descriptions of the keyword changes for these new algorithms.

Sounds like you're new to eQuest...I've put together a blog for doing
State of Washington ELCCA's and, to a lesser extent, general LEED
studies:
 
http://elcca-exchange.blogspot.com/
 
There are Design Development Wizard screens for doing skylights, but if
you've moved on to detailed edit mode then skylights are just windows in
a roof -- use the 'Create Child Component' option from the detailed edit
treeview.
 
Also use Google to 'site search' the BLDG-SIM archives (
http://www.gard.com/ml/bldg-sim-archive/threads.html ) and you will the
answers to many questions from years past.

2. Does any one have step by step manual on how to use weathermaker (part of

3. Is there any subscriber from Indonesia who is working in the building

Any info is greatly appreciated. Thanks very much

Ramana,
I would recommend coupling the GSHP system with hot water baseboards operating at the same temperatures as your floor would require.  The in-floor radiant heat module of eQuest is rather simplistic and only includes the radiant floor system with no additional features (outside air, cooling, etc) so often you just have to design around the parameters of the mechanical system in terms of temperatures and design but use hot water baseboards. 
Regards,
Ren?e

Dear all,

I was looking up the archives of the mailing list and I found the question but no responses, so my question might be a repeat:

Can a radiant slab (heating only) be connected to ground source heat pump in eQUEST? I tried but could not.  If not, any workarounds that can achieve the same effect?

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200703191905.AA052215pd80001390568@gard.com>

We have operable skylights on top of the roof that exhaust the indoor
air from a large naturally ventilated space.  We want to minimize the
number of hours to close the skylights due to rain.  

 

We have used buoyancy driving flows to calculate that the exit velocity
through the clam shell opening range from 50 to 100 fpm.  Is there a
standard or research, possible from stack flue design, that states what
exit velocities will prevent rain entrainment.  The building is in San
Francisco so the rain is not torrential downpour.  


Thanks

Ian

One question you (or anyone else) may ask yourself is how much difference it will make when you enter these different zones.

A)  If you have a LEED building you should match the designed zones - lean towards detailed.

B)  If this is a schematic design, and the scheduling and load density of people/lights/equipment of the departments between floors will not be much different - lean towards simplified.

If you are in the middle ground somewhere as will often be the case, then you'll have to decide whether to expend extra time modeling explicitly or using multipliers, or if you are going to need some specific output that you couldn't capture with multiplied floors and/or simplified zoning.

Hope this helps!

since I just now was figuring out the same thing myself, thought I would share it. Here is what I did:

use custom on all screens where needed. Each floor is a new shell. and on the next screen it asks for the placement of the shell - you can say immediately above/ below another shell.

The way I have handled multi level zoning is to build
one floor at a time in the wizard and saving it as a
different file. Then I manually go to the inp file and
change all the names of the spaces and associated
polygons and zones by doing a simple search and
replace using textpad. Finally, I import the inp file
of the second floor in the detailed interface.
Hope this helps.

Hi

Is it possible to create spaces with different configurations on each
floor (non repeating spaces) in a multi-storied building using the
wizard in eQUEST?

How can that be done?

Thanks

I think you can do it if the space next to the interior window is
declared as a sun-space.

	Renee,
	 
	Have you downloaded equest 3.61b yet?  This new version seems to
have a greatly expanded array of skylight modeling capability.  Although
I haven't had an oportunity to use it yet there is capability for
specifying light tubes.  I would be curious to know if you get better
results than previous versions of eQuest.  I still don't think you can
model daylighting through interior windows though.
	 
	Also for those who haven't updated eQuest in a while there are
some recent updates.
	 
	There is an updated version of 3.6 from last week.  
	 
	For those using 3.61b there is an update that fixes several bugs
and includes new features like variable exhaust at the zone level and
packaged PIU units so you can finally model Appendix G System 6.  Look
for eQuest 3-61 D2244e4 dated Feb 16.
	 
	Because the different versions install in different directories
you can have v3.55, 3.6 and 3.61 on your PC at the same time without any
trouble.

		I have never had success at getting daylighting to work
without exterior glazing on a wall. Interior glazing and skylights alone
will not work. DOE2 engines require some exterior walled glazing. I
would recommend that you create the zone in a separate file, determine
the T-vis and SHGC change through two layers of glazing on the wall and
add your skylights. I'm not clear if DOE2 will model the daylighting
effect of skylights well or if it will just take the daylight energy
savings from the wall. I was modeling SolaTubes the other day in a zone
with exterior walled glazing and it didn't seem to provide much savings,
a lot less than I would have expected.  Anyone else have any thoughts on
this?

		I am modeling a building with a 4-story internal atrium
with skylights on the roof.  There are some interior rooms with interior
windows facing the atrium, and I have enabled daylighting for these
rooms.  When I run the simulation I get errors for all of the rooms with
only interior windows saying that the window area must be greater than
0.1 ft2 for the room.  The windows are much larger than that.  Has
anyone else run into this kind of problem?  Any thoughts?

Tim:


As usual, the answer is 'it depends"... The (annual) efficiency of 
instantaneous hot water heaters is a controversial topic and is a 
function driven primarily by whether or not the a standing pilot is 
used, the frequency and duration of hot water loads, and the estimated 
amount of cold water usage 'wasted' if/when users are waiting for hot 
water to be delivered or when the minimum flow requirements are exceeded 
and the hot water draw becomes cold.

At any rate, the TREAT (Targeted Residential Energy Analysis Tools) 
software suite allows one to model the annual effects of changing from a 
tank storage type of system to a tankless type of system.

More importantly, TREAT employs a very unique savings determination 
algorithm which allows users to combine multiple individual improvements 
into 'packages' to see the interactive effects - which more accurately 
capture and quantify the 'interactive' savings that occur when multiple 
improvements are simulated. For example, TREAT could accurately quantify 
the interactive savings from changing out existing shower-heads and 
faucet aerators with 'low flow' devices, while switching hot water 
heaters from say a tank type 40 gallon electric to a tankless propane 
model, combined with improving the insulation of the DHW piping (piping 
surface areas are user specified) in unconditioned spaces from from R1 
to R4, and resetting the DHW temperature from 135 degrees F to 120 deg F. 

As always, users must provide accurate input (GIGO), if they expect 
accurate output, which is especially important when working with 
simulating an existing building.  To assist with this, TREAT integrates 
a billing analysis tool for use against the baseline building model 
which compares baseload (weather independent) and heating/cooling slope 
(weather dependent) energy consumption of the model against utility 
billing data. Good data from residential utility bills are required for 
this feature, and the data is weather normalized (corrected) using daily 
high/low temperatures correlating to the billing data period, while the 
model uses TMY2 30 year average weather data . If billing analysis is 
used to 'match' the baseline model , users can improve the confidence of 
their predictions when investigating baseload (hot water, appliance and 
lighting) energy improvements.

This is probably more than you wanted - but I wanted to make sure you 
were aware of the possibilities when you are considering annual 
simulations. You can download a 30 day fully functional trial version of 
TREAT (including program documentation) from http://www.treatsoftware.com.

Have fun - Chris

The problem has been resolved.
First install the eQUEST program under Vista.   Go to  Start  >  Help & Support (Sony Computer)  >  Information from Microsoft  >  Choose No. 2 (Get your programs to work on this version of Windows).  This will open up the "Program Compatibility Wizard".  Follow the instructions.  Several other programs that I tried to install (Adobe Acrobat 6.0 Standard and AutoCAD LT 2005) from the CD using the Wizard were not accepted.  AutoCAD LT installed but when you try to use the program there is message saying incompatible with Vista.  The DOE2.1E programs, using the DOS or Command Prompt window (Start  >  All Programs  >  Accessories  >  Command Prompt) worked. So did EnergyPlus using the Text Editor.

Ian,

What program are you using to get these results ? Since the loads and temperatures are so dependent on the solar gain and the building's thermal mass, I would want to see plots of the inside and outside temperature, ventilation rates, and solar gain over the course of both day.  What is the temperature range on the day that peaks at 98 F ?  I do find it odd that the building overheats so much more when the temperature peaks at only 82 F.

  I have a naturally ventilated office and am using the Sherman Grimsrud method.  Even when I specify  a Vent Area Fraction of 0.01 and a max ACH of 0.01 still get enough air flow such that during the hottest hour of the year in Seattle which is  98?F, the inside temperature only peaks at 99?F which is impossible since there is considerable amounts of glass and internal heat gain.  With these inputs there should be no ventilation and I should be getting extremely hot temperatures.  

   

   

  Then again, looking at the summer design day which is specified as a 82?F and 18?F range and the indoor conditions are shown below.  Why is the design day which has a relative low max temperature predicting so much hotter indoor temperatures that make sense compared to those from the annual simulation.

Nicole:

The building % hours out of range can be found in the DOE2.2 BEPS and
BEPU reports. The BEPU outputs are frequently used to show compliance
with A90.1-2004-App G and the LEED NC2.2-EAc1 letter template.

 

However, the SS reports have a lot of good zone specific information. I
believe you can look at individual zone unmet load hours (i.e. hours out
of range) in the SS-F report.

 

Incidentally, eQuest also provides a summary report (under Airside HVAC)
that shows individual; hours out of range for each thermal zone.

 

I hope this helps.

Dear folks:

 

Would anyone help me gotta know where to find the report of unment lolad
hours in Equest Sim files that is required in ASHRAE APPG?

 

According to ASHRAE 90.1 APPG , dose the "unment load hours" mean the
sum of all unmet load hors of each zone,  Please advise if I mis
understood this important term.

Arizona State has (or at least had, last time I checked) a 54,000 
ton-hr empty-tank chilled water storage system.

http://www.lswsd.com/projects/projdesc_thermalsys.htm

According to the link below, the U of Az ice system is 15,000 ton-hr.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200703161105.AA0505812pd80001389076@gard.com>

Greetings!
   
  Does anyone have any updated average cooling load density data for typical LEED buildings? The old rule-of-thumb of 400 sq. ft./ton seems grossly outdated in today's high-performance design environment. I am now seeing residential cooling load densities at 1000 sq. ft./ton for high-performance green rated homes but was curious if anyone has a database of cooling load data for commercial buildings that may be used as a check figure when running LEED simulations. I see nothing in the USGBC resource area regarding this.
   
  Thank you and best regards,

The U of A uses water ice as the phase change material for thermal
storage.  I visited their TES plant, it was very interesting and they
were very accommodating with tours.  If any of you have the opportunity
I highly recommend visiting.

If I remember correctly, they have the largest TES system in the Western
USA and run an entire campus, about 10k tons cooling, on 3 pumps.

Alpana,

This is interesting, thanks.  I see that the 
products actually listed in their current 
literature only go down to phase change temperatures of 23C.

The latent heat of 140 kJ/kg is only about 40% of 
that of pure water (335 kJ/kg), so the storage 
density is also around 40% of ice.

Pure ice storage density is around 8 - 10 times 
that of sensible storage for air-conditioning 
applications, but ice storage modules are 
frequently cylindrical and their contents are not 
all water.  In the case of containerized PCM, the 
tank is filled with spheres containing the PCM 
with glycol solution flowing through the void 
space, so the actual density may be only have 
that of the pure PCM.  Consequently, a medium 
with the density of this PCM might in application 
have only two or three times the density of 
sensible storage and is bound to be much more 
expensive.  I believe that this is one of the key 
reasons that higher temperature cool storage PCM 
media flopped in the US a decade ago and why they 
would likely do so again until someone comes up 
with a medium with a (much) higher latent heat.

Does anyone know whether a product exists or research has been done on using replacing water with Phase Change Material for thermal storage systems.  The phase change should have a similar heat of fusion as water (314 kJ/kg) but a melting point at ~40-45?F.

Dear folks:

Would anyone help me gotta know where to find the report of unment lolad
hours in Equest Sim files that is required in ASHRAE APPG?

According to ASHRAE 90.1 APPG , dose the "unment load hours" mean the sum of
all unmet load hors of each zone,  Please advise if I mis understood this
important term.

Bill,

The issue of purchased chilled water has come up on this list previously. I agree with you that if the proposed building uses purchased chilled water, the baseline should also. Others disagree. I think it needs to be submitted as a continuos maintenance proposal and considered.

As far as I know, USGBC does not allow addenda to 90.1 to be used. If there is a specific issue you need to ask for a CIR from USGBC.

Mike,
Yes, that does help regarding the supply air temperature reset
question. Does anyone know whether these addenda are approved by USGBC?
The LEED reference guide specifically refers to A90.1 "without
amendments" which is an interesting choice of words, but it appears that
some of the addenda were driven by USGBC. My understanding is that
someone has submitted a CIR asking for clarification, but I haven't seen
a response yet.
 
Regarding the chilled water supply temperature reset, I will plan on
submitting a continuous maintenance proposal taking into account some of
the feedback received from 90.1ecb.
 
Also wanted to ask what the intent was for how the reset sequence is
implemented. If you are using chilled water from a central loop in your
proposed design where reset temperature is not provided, the reset would
need to occur at the building through pump/valve/mixing control schemes.
If your building includes chilled water generation, the reset could
occur at the source. For the baseline building, A90.1 requires you to
model chillers. While previous correspondence indicated that the intent
was to use minimum efficiency chiller equipment as the baseline
comparison, this seems as though there is a lot of potential for
unsupportable variations in cooling costs between the baseline and
proposed design. If the model is using purchased chilled water rates in
the proposed design and electricity rates in the baseline model, you
could see cost penalties or savings that are unwarranted depending on
how the purchased chilled water rate is structured. The best comparison
would to be to have both the baseline and proposed models use the same
chilled water source. 
Thanks,

Bill,

I will take a crack at these. In general Appendix G has tried to
eliminate options in modeling the baseline building. This is so that
users can not try various baseline options and choose the one that shows
the most savings. So when options are available in other parts of the
Standard, G has chosen what seems to make the most sense for use in the
baseline. That sometimes causes problems like the one you brought up.
Maybe we need to propose some modification language that states that if
CW reset results in unmet dehumidification loads greater than the
proposed building, the reset temperature needs to be dropped lower (but
not less than proposed), until the loads are equal. Do you want to try
putting together a continuos maintenance proposal for this?

The supply air reset issue has already been addressed in Addendum A.
Now that sections states;
" The air temperature for cooling shall be reset higher by 5?F (2.3?C)
under the minimum cooling load conditions". 
Non of the sizing language remains. This was published in the 90.1
interim addenda release, and will be in the 2007 version of the
Standard.

Hope that helped

All,
I have a question regarding ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Section G3.1.3.8 - Chilled
Water Supply Temperature Reset. Can anyone offer some background as to
the intent of this section? Appendix G does not appear to allow any
exceptions and requires chilled water supply temperature reset based on
outdoor air drybulb (CWT = 44 to 54 deg F during outdoor drybulb range
of 80 to 60 deg F).The equivalent prescriptive path section (6.5.4.3)
exempts reset controls when VFD pump control is used or if reset
controls would cause heating, cooling, humidifying, or dehumidifying
loads to not be met and also allows reset based on return water
temperature rather than outdoor drybulb only. It appears that if you are
designing a space with sensitive humidity and/or low space temperature
requirements, supply temperature reset could result in space conditions
not being met. What was the thinking in eliminating the exceptions and
the return water temperature option and were the full range of potential
thermal comfort requirements considered? Is the intent that if you are
trying to serve an Operating Room with a VAV/Chilled water system and
you need 68 deg F/50% RH at the space, a supplemental DX cooling coil or
dehumidification system is preferred?

Also Section G3.1.3.12 - Supply Air Temperature Reset indicates that
"supply air temperature shall be reset based on zone demand from the
design temperature difference to a 10 deg F temperature difference under
minimum load conditions" and that "design air flow rates shall be sized
for the reset supply air temperature, i.e., a 10 deg F temperature
difference." This appears to require design air flows to be calculated
based on a 10 deg F temperature difference, effectively doubling air
flow rates from the standard 20 deg F temperature difference. If you
only need to reset supply air temperature down to a 10 deg F delta
during minimum load conditions, why would you size the system based on a
10 deg F delta? What is the intent of this requirement? Doesn't this
result in larger air side systems, i.e. more materials and larger fans?

I am curious how others are dealing with these requirements.

Thanks,
Bill Talbert, AEI

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200703151132.AA3216921pd80001388311@gard.com>

There were one or two US manufacturer of 
alternative PCMs for cool thermal storage during 
the height of the TES boom (Transphase) that are 
no longer in business.  Sounded like a great idea 
at the time, but the economics never worked 
out.  Storage density was not as good as water and cost was far greater.

The main manufacturer of such media that I am aware of today is Cristopia.

http://www.cristopia.com/

Their web site indicates, however, that they only 
offer media with 0C (water) and 27C phase change temperatures.

The 1993 ASHRAE Design Guide for Cool Thermal 
Storage (currently out of print) has a chapter on eutectic materials.

All,
I have a question regarding ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Section G3.1.3.8 - Chilled Water Supply Temperature Reset. Can anyone offer some background as to the intent of this section? Appendix G does not appear to allow any exceptions and requires chilled water supply temperature reset based on outdoor air drybulb (CWT = 44 to 54 deg F during outdoor drybulb range of 80 to 60 deg F).The equivalent prescriptive path section (6.5.4.3) exempts reset controls when VFD pump control is used or if reset controls would cause heating, cooling, humidifying, or dehumidifying loads to not be met and also allows reset based on return water temperature rather than outdoor drybulb only. It appears that if you are designing a space with sensitive humidity and/or low space temperature requirements, supply temperature reset could result in space conditions not being met. What was the thinking in eliminating the exceptions and the return water temperature option and were the full range of potential thermal comfort requirements considered? Is the intent that if you are trying to serve an Operating Room with a VAV/Chilled water system and you need 68 deg F/50% RH at the space, a supplemental DX cooling coil or dehumidification system is preferred?
 
Also Section G3.1.3.12 - Supply Air Temperature Reset indicates that "supply air temperature shall be reset based on zone demand from the design temperature difference to a 10 deg F temperature difference under minimum load conditions" and that "design air flow rates shall be sized for the reset supply air temperature, i.e., a 10 deg F temperature difference." This appears to require design air flows to be calculated based on a 10 deg F temperature difference, effectively doubling air flow rates from the standard 20 deg F temperature difference. If you only need to reset supply air temperature down to a 10 deg F delta during minimum load conditions, why would you size the system based on a 10 deg F delta? What is the intent of this requirement? Doesn't this result in larger air side systems, i.e. more materials and larger fans?
 
I am curious how others are dealing with these requirements.
 
Thanks,
Bill Talbert, AEI

Does anyone know whether a product exists or research has been done on using replacing water with Phase Change Material for thermal storage systems.  The phase change should have a similar heat of fusion as water (314 kJ/kg) but a melting point at ~40-45?F.

Hello,

I am trying to model a variable air volume unit with hot water
preheating, DX cooling with an evaporative cooled condensing unit and a
DX heat reclaim coil (hot gas reclaim) for reheating the discharge air.
Any ideas about how to model a DX heat reclaim coil for reheating?

Thanks!

Hi all,
 
I'm currently reviewing results from simulation done on a program called ASEAM2D, about 15 years ago.  As far as I am aware, ASEAM2D was a DOS program.  So, my questions are: 
 
1.  Does ASEAM2D still exist?  
2.  If so, is it able to run on MS Windows OS?
3.  If not, is there any current program that uses the same format of weather data?

Hello Vickie,
 
I created a blogtopic to help answer your question...

Getting the latest version of eQuest sure couldn't hurt, but I don't
think that's the basic issue.  Timely your separate question on chilled
beams, I'm interested to hear what people are doing to simulate these...

Thank you very much for your reply.
Unfortunately I couldn't find "conditioned height" in the "Zone

My current eQuest is version 3.55. Should I update my eQuest or any

I really appreciate your help.

Hi Vickie,
 
Are you seeing a "Conditioned Height" input box in the "Zone
Characteristics" screen when you check the "Multilevel Space (atrium)"
box (see attachment)?  If not, then you may have a problem with the
shell -- a problem I have seen before but we were able to work around
it.  
 
Let me know if that's the case, and I'll try to put you in touch with
someone from DOE2 who could help.
 
On the performance curve questions, haven't yet looked those very
closely -- just using the standard ones out-of-the-box.
 
Brandon

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200703121940.AA4026296pd80001386732@gard.com>

Hi all
 
I am using eQuest to try to model a Passive Chilled Beam system using a
Dummy OA zone of SZRH and Fan Coil Units in the zones.
I specified the Dummy zone for only OA treatment without any internal
loads, and set COOL-CONTROL as CONSTANT, 
COOL-SET-T as 59 oF(15oC). Because CB won't kick in untill the room
temperature is above 15oC with AHU.
There is one AHU for the Dummy zone.
Then for all the actual zones, I specified FC with OA-FROM-SYSTEM as
dummy zone.
There is a sparated loop (chilled water temperature of 14oC supply and
17oC return) defined for the FC.
As my understanding you can remove the Fan energy of FC then the energy
consumption of FC will represent the actual loads for passive chilled
beam. And the Dummy OA zone of SZRH will deal with constant OA load. 
Am I right, anything I missed for the assuption.
My problems are:
1) warning message in SIM file saying "Preheat/heating-capacity is too
low to provide the requested supply temperature for the 
   calculated mixed air temperature...". Although I used auto sizing for
the heating capacity.
2) What is the different impact if I specify the actual zones as FC from
IU. 
3) I did some test runs of FC and IU. The results indicated heating
energy consumption of IU was 10 times as FC.
4) The test run of passive chilled beam shows the cooling and heat
rejection energy goes 50%, pump goes 25% up 
    than the conventional VAV. And Fan became only 20% of the
conventional VAV. 
    The result is quite different from my expectation and some
reference. I am expecting similar cooling and heat rejection figure but 
    apporx 150% of pump, 50% of fan energy than the conventional VAV.
Any comments would be appreciated.
Thank you in advance.
 
Kind Regards,
Vickie

not sure if it is fully functional however.  I am operating Windows XP

them. I believe the last time I ran ASEAM was in the mid 90's in the DOS
window of Windows 95. I believe ASEAM weather data used the old Air Force 5
degree bin format, I don't know of anyone using it anymore. Perhaps Harry
Misuriello, who was the prime author of ASEAM could help you, he is
presently working at Owens Corning (harry.misuriello at owenscorning.com)

Hi all,
 
I'm currently reviewing results from simulation done on a program called
ASEAM2D, about 15 years ago.  As far as I am aware, ASEAM2D was a DOS
program.  So, my questions are: 
 
1.  Does ASEAM2D still exist?  
2.  If so, is it able to run on MS Windows OS?
3.  If not, is there any current program that uses the same format of
weather data?

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200703121030.AA3050796pd80001386290@gard.com>

Renee,
 
Have you downloaded equest 3.61b yet?  This new version seems to have a
greatly expanded array of skylight modeling capability.  Although I
haven't had an oportunity to use it yet there is capability for
specifying light tubes.  I would be curious to know if you get better
results than previous versions of eQuest.  I still don't think you can
model daylighting through interior windows though.
 
Also for those who haven't updated eQuest in a while there are some
recent updates.
 
There is an updated version of 3.6 from last week.  
 
For those using 3.61b there is an update that fixes several bugs and
includes new features like variable exhaust at the zone level and
packaged PIU units so you can finally model Appendix G System 6.  Look
for eQuest 3-61 D2244e4 dated Feb 16.
 
Because the different versions install in different directories you can
have v3.55, 3.6 and 3.61 on your PC at the same time without any
trouble.

	I have never had success at getting daylighting to work without
exterior glazing on a wall. Interior glazing and skylights alone will
not work. DOE2 engines require some exterior walled glazing. I would
recommend that you create the zone in a separate file, determine the
T-vis and SHGC change through two layers of glazing on the wall and add
your skylights. I'm not clear if DOE2 will model the daylighting effect
of skylights well or if it will just take the daylight energy savings
from the wall. I was modeling SolaTubes the other day in a zone with
exterior walled glazing and it didn't seem to provide much savings, a
lot less than I would have expected.  Anyone else have any thoughts on
this?

	I am modeling a building with a 4-story internal atrium with
skylights on the roof.  There are some interior rooms with interior
windows facing the atrium, and I have enabled daylighting for these
rooms.  When I run the simulation I get errors for all of the rooms with
only interior windows saying that the window area must be greater than
0.1 ft2 for the room.  The windows are much larger than that.  Has
anyone else run into this kind of problem?  Any thoughts?

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200703121039.AA3915265pd80001386327@gard.com>

Dear all,

Are there examples of buildings using ethanol (corn based or otherwise) as
on site energy source in Cogen or a furnace or some other way?

If it can actually be used, I'm interested in knowing the precise process
and the efficiency of the process compared to using non renewable sources.

Thanks,

I found a link to ASEAM at:

It looks like you can download it still.  Not sure if it 
works with recent versions of Windows.

PS: One of my first projects at GARD was to write a 
translator from ASEAM to DOE-2.  Back when DOE-2 
simulations took 30 minutes to run.

TREAT (Targeted Residential Energy Analysis Tool) is a 8760 hour whole building energy simulation tool which uses the SUNREL engine and is designed specifically for single/multi zone residential energy improvement modeling.

TREAT's unique functionality includes an integrated billing analysis module and weather normalization techniques, which allow a modeler to easily 'calibrate' their whole building energy model before investigating the impacts of building improvements. In addition, TREAT provides an integrated reporting tool including the ability to produce custom reports in MSword using XML outputs from the program. Treat also integrates non-energy (health and safety) improvements into overall financial savings calculations.

A 30 day fully functional trial version of the software can be downloaded from http://www.treatsoftware.com.

Have fun

Mojtaba---
 
Here is a link to the DOE-2 weather utilities web page which has an extensive list of weather data files and weather utilities programs.  To my understanding, TMY or TMY2 files are already in the .bin format here.  
 
http://doe2.com/index_Wth.html
 
If you're looking for a different kind of file conversion, download the DOEWth program at the bottom of the page as it has different modules for converting between weather data formats.  I've used it to convert .bin files to .txt files that can be viewed in Excel or a text editor. Hope that helps.
 
Regards,
Andrew

TREAT (Targeted Residential Energy Analysis Tool) is a 8760 hour whole 
building energy simulation tool which uses the SUNREL engine and is 
designed specifically for single/multi zone residential energy 
improvement modeling.

TREAT's unique functionality includes an integrated billing analysis 
module and weather normalization techniques, which allow a modeler to 
easily 'calibrate' their whole building energy model before 
investigating the impacts of building improvements. In addition, TREAT 
provides an integrated reporting tool including the ability to produce 
custom reports in MSword using XML outputs from the program. Treat also 
integrates non-energy (health and safety) improvements into overall 
financial savings calculations.

A 30 day fully functional trial version of the software can be 
downloaded from http://www.treatsoftware.com.

Have fun

Vickie,
 
I presume you're talking about eQuest.  In addition to the specifying
the upper floors as 'open to below', specify the lowest floor as a
'multilevel space' -- with an overall height of the combined multiple
floor levels.  This "raises the roof" of the lowest level space, and it
should be simple then to place a skylight using the wizard.
 
Have used the multilevel space feature for gymnasiums, cafeterias,
libraries etc. -- not for an atrium specifically, but I would suspect if
you have actual internal glazing, then by all means specify it as such
particularly if you are going to model daylighting.
 
Hope that helps

Hi all
 
I have a problem when I tried to model a multi-level space atrium with
skylight.
When I modified the atrium in Wizard as "open to below", there didn't
show any roof surface which I can define skylight.
If I don't modify it "open to below", then there is internal floor in
the model.
I found in the TOPICS manual it shows the program takes solar radiation
absorbed by interior walls into account.
Shall I specify the internal walls adjacent to atrium as "interior
glazing" so that the direct solar can come through?
Or if actually there is no interior glazing, can I specify the internal
walls as "Air"?
I am just concerned about the heat transfer from the skylight and
atrium.
Could anyone give me some advice on how to specify the multi level
atrium with skylight properly.
Thank you in advance.
 
Regards,
Vickie

Assuming you are using DOE2 this approach may work.  You will have to test 
but define a packaged single zone system with the same flow rate and supply 
kW as your exhaust kW.  Do not define any exhaust in the zone.  Set the 
cooling capacity to a very low number.   Schedule the fans off but night 
cycle on any.  Set the heating set point very low and impose a process load 
in the zone to mimic the heat gain from the electrical equipment.  Set the 
cooling set point appropriately and this will cycle on the fan when the 
temperature gets too hot.  The best way to impose a process load without it 
showing up in BEPS is to add in the appropriate number of occupants and set 
the latent gain small and sensible high.

This may give you what you want.

Hi All:

The App G mentions that the lighting power for parking garages and building facades shall be modeled whereas the reference guide for LEED 2.2 mentions that exterior lighting should be modeled. Exterior lighting includes more than just the building facade - so which one should be followed for the energy credit analysis?

My interpretation is that this is not a naturally ventilated space. You
would need to provide filtered air in the quantities stipulated by the
Standard. I would assume that MERV 13 filtration is required by LEED.
The presence or absence of certain coils does not change the fact that
this system distributes fresh air through mechanical means to each
space.

Hello All,

I hope these questions are allowed to be addressed in this group:

 

If a building does not have heating and cooling system but has
mechanically ventilation system, is it still considered a natural
ventilated building as the section 5.1 of Standard 62 suggests?

Does this building need to follow section 6 of the standard 62?

How about its compliance with EQ c5, does it need to have MERV 13 air
filters?

 

Any information is greatly appreciated.

Thanks

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Boiler Standby Loss and Cycling Times
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200703081657.AA5726218pd80001384498@gard.com>

Standby losses

"About 1.5%-2.0% of the rated boiler fuel input is lost to the engine
room. While this loss is small when boilers operate at or near their
rated capacity, it can be significant where boilers operate frequently
at low loads. For example, imagine a boiler rated at 10 GJ/hr fuel
input, but operating at a 2 GJ/hr level. The standby loss of 2% of 10
GJ/hr is 200 megajoules per hour. This is the reason why plants with
large seasonal variations in steam-use install small boilers to operate
during the summer rather than operate large boilers year round. "

This from the State of Victoria's sustainability web site... Google
"firetube standby losses boiler optimisation" and the article should be
at the top of the list.  So 1.6% standby loss for a firetube boiler
sounds right in the ballpark, and jibes with everyday experience...to
me, STANDBY-TIME as defined translates directly to standby losses as a
percentage of full load capacity. 
 
Condensing boilers on the other hand, should have near-zero standby
losses since they don't need to stay warm to avoid thermal shock.  It
was tough to quickly find manufactures documentation confirming this,
but a call to our local Cleaver-Brooks rep who in turn called the
factory came back with an estimate of about 0.25%, i.e. 0.0025, that he
will attempt back up with a published reference tomorrow.  
 
Thanks for bringing up this topic Sean, the default standby time in my
eQuest simulations is 0.027 for firetubes... a number that definitely
needs to be changed when running a condensing boiler as the parametric
comparative.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200703071429.AA2931218pd80001383964@gard.com>

Hello,

This question is applicable to all modeling programs and pertains to
LEED-NC.  I have a one-story building which has a 55% window to wall ratio
(WWR).  The fenestration breaks down as roughly 20% glass doors and 80%
windows.  When I create a baseline model of the building by reducing the WWR
to 40% and creating a band of windows evenly distributed across all facades,
is it necessary to maintain the same ratio between windows and glass doors
as what I have in the proposed building?  Is this an acceptable method?

Thanks!
Andy

Thanks for getting this going Varkie, it has been a great topic...
 
 
Having just modeled a heat recovery system for a large 100% outside air
system with runaround waterside heat recovery, I can answer a couple of
your questions (staying far away from LEED interpretations):
 
1) To turn off the airside economizer in eQuest, set the 'Minimum OA
Control Method' to 'Fraction of Design Flow' (OA-CONTROL = FIXED).
 
2a) The 'waterside economizer' terminology is a bit ambiguous, in my
understanding it's referring only to 'free cooling' available by running
cold condenser water through chillers that are off.  Something like 15
to 20% of a chiller's rated capacity may be utilized in cold months
without running the compressor given the right ambient conditions.  
 
2b) If its a runaround waterside economizer you want, with recovery
coils constantly in the outdoor and exhaust air streams, then use the
airside economizer and set up the parametric run along the lines of the
following example:
 
$ adjust the supply and returns statics of the main unit to 
$ account for the increased pressure drop
SUPPLY-STATIC    = 6.00
RETURN-STATIC    = 3.00
ERV-RECOVER-TYPE = SENSIBLE-HX
$ specify OA and EXH flows if only a portion of the exhaust is recovered
ERV-OA-FLOW      = 46960
ERV-EXH-FLOW     = 28590
$ potentially the effectiveness can increase to 0.75 if a two-pass coil
used
ERV-SENSIBLE-EFF = 0.53
ERV-RUN-CTRL     = OA-EXHAUST-DT
ERV-RECOVER-MODE = OA-HEAT/COOL
$ some may argue this control method, FLOAT gives maximum heat recovery
ERV-TEMP-CTRL    = FLOAT
ERV-CAP-CTRL     = MODULATE-HX
$ input the runaround pump power consumption here, it will be switched
$ on only when the ERV is activated
ERV-HX-KW        = 4.5
ERV-FANS         = HVAC-SUPPLY/RETURN
ERV-MOTOR-CLASS  = HI-EFF
$ set the ERV statics to zero, since it is NOT a separate unit 
$ in series with the main unit
ERV-OA-STATIC    = 0
ERV-EXH-STATIC   = 0
ERV-FROST-CTRL   = USE-CAP-CTRL
 
 
 
Hope that helps, corrections and improvements will be posted here:

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] RE: Process Loads and LEED



Thanks for all the responses.  It does not solve my problem where the
proposed process load in this "office" building that I am looking at is
more than 60% of the total annual energy use.  Here is a suggested
solution.  The proposed process load should be entered in the baseline
and proposed models since it affects the heating and cooling loads and
the difference in efficiencies of the baseline and proposed systems
serving the loads. However, when determining the percent energy savings
for LEED certification, the common process load should be removed from
both sides.

I apologize for bothering BLDG-SIM subscribers with more questions
because of my ignorance.

A high process load offsets the heating load in the perimeter zones and
you can get a building in a cold climate with no heating.  If the
perimeter zone is reduced to 1 foot with no process loads, people or
lighting, then the computer program will not account for the benefit of
day-lighting on the lighting system unless the program can ignore this
perimeter zone and apply day-lighting to the adjacent zone if it is
separated by an "AIR-WALL" (DOE2.1E).  

The building that I am looking at has ceiling PIU boxes designed to
serve a less than 1 foot perimeter zone and UFAD PIU boxes serving the
interior zone.  Both sets of PIU boxes are served by the same system.
In this building, the glass height is 12 feet and the ceiling height,
beyond the 1 foot perimeter zone, is 10 feet.  Since the zone depth
entered into the program is 15 feet and has a 10 foot ceiling, eQUEST
flags it down as an error but not DOE2.1E.  Perhaps VisualDOE will not
call this an error.

How would you turn off the Airside Economizer in a DOE2 based program.
With TRACE700 you can say Yes or No.  Climate zone 3A does not require
and airside economizer for the baseline for a large office building.
Setting the "Drybulb High Limit" and the "Economizer Low Limit" in
eQUEST to their maximum values of 80F seems to do the trick.  I cannot
find the Waterside Economizer in eQUEST although the keywords and
commands for modeling this, exists in both DOE2.1E and DOE2.2.

How is the Zone-Fan-Ratio (ZFR) determined for Fan Powered Terminal
Boxes?  In eQUEST the default for Series FPB is 1.0 and for Parallel it
is 0.5.  How was this determined.  The definition in the DOE2.2 manual
is:  ZFR * Primary CFM = FPB Supply CFM.  

In the case of the project I am looking at (a UFAD system with Parallel
FPBs) the Primary Air Temp is 48F (for dehumidification), the FPB Supply
Air Temp = 65F and Recirculation Air Temp is 78F.  What is the ZFR?
Would an increase in ZFR reduce the energy use.  The Simulation
Guidebook by Energy Design Resources suggests putting 25% of the people
and 33% of lights and equipment in the ceiling plenum.  This produced
very little in energy savings.  

Is this an acceptable solution:


Summer Cooling Indoor Temp:  From 0' to 7' at 75 F.  From 7' to 10' at
85 F   Average Temp = 78 F.  (0.7*75) + (0.3*85) = 78


Winter Heating Indoor Temp:  From 0' to 7' at 72 F.  From 7' to 10' at
62 F   Average Temp = 69 F.  (0.7*72) + (0.3*62) = 69

(As with the theoretical method of moving internal loads to the plenum,
the fact that hot air collects at the top should be not an issue since
we are looking at heating only the mass of air from 0' to 7' to 72 F).

How would you account for the energy savings using ECM motors.  One
suggestion is to reduce the energy use of the fans in PIU boxes by 25%.
The default KW/CFM in eQUEST is 0.00033 (0.33 kw for a 1000 cfm box).
Reducing this by 25%  produced almost no energy savings using eQUEST.

According to the Code of  Federal Regulations (10CFR435/436) occupancy
based lighting sensors can be modeled by reducing the lighting
schedule/profile fraction by 30%.  Is this acceptable to LEED?  I am
assuming that occupancy based ventilation can be modeled by creating a
MIN-AIR-SCH (DOE2.1E) that is equal to the design OA fraction (from a
trial run) multiplied by the occupancy schedule fraction.

The energy program developers should provide guidelines for modeling
energy conservation measures using their programs.  Code and LEED
authorities should test them and approve them.

I went back and looked at the public review version of LEED 2.2 dated
December 2004 on the cover and October 19 in the footer.  Here is how
the original credit was proposed:
"Must be compared against a baseline building that both complies with
Appendix G to Standard 90.1-2004 (without amendments) and that has a
process energy consumption that is a minimum of 25% of the total energy
consumption for the baseline building."

In the final version of the the LEED 2.2 dated October 2005 that same
verbiage had been changed to 

"Must be compared against a baseline building that complies with
Appendix G to Standard 90.1-2004 (without amendments). The default
process energy cost is 25% of the total energy"

 I think the intent is that the default process energy cost used in the
calculation of LEED credits for V2.2 is a max of 25%.  If your building
has 60% process energy you would only have to count that portion of
process energy that equals 25% of the total energy.  This would level
the playing field for all buildings regardless of how much process
energy is used.  If a building uses less than 25% then you have to
justify the legitimacy of that claim.  

I think someone should submit a CIR asking whether this is the correct
interpretation of the Credit.

Respectfully,

The modeling approach you suggest for process loads would not comply with
the current requirements for LEED.  The 25% process load requirement is set
up as a minimum process load requirement to avoid underreporting of process
load energy usage (i.e. an office building reporting 0.25 W/sf of
miscellaneous equipment).  However, all projects are still expected to
follow the Appendix G, Table G.3.1.12 requirements for receptacles and
process loads, stating that "these loads shall be included when calculating
the baseline building performance and proposed building performance").
Unless LEED requirements change, If your building is expected to consume 60%
process energy, it should be modeled with 60% process energy, and the
Percentage Improvement should be calculated with your projected actual
process energy consumption included in the energy results.  I would echo
Marcus' recommendation unless & until the EA TAG comes up with an alternate
solution:

"In the mean time I would suggest that project teams strive to make all
building energy systems as energy efficient as possible and follow the
exceptional calculation method to show savings for process loads in the LEED
certification review process."

The energy program developers should provide guidelines for modeling energy conservation measures using their programs.  Code and LEED authorities should test them and approve them.

I went back and looked at the public review version of LEED 2.2 dated December 2004 on the cover and October 19 in the footer.  Here is how the original credit was proposed:
"Must be compared against a baseline building that both complies with Appendix G to Standard 90.1-2004 (without amendments) and that has a process energy consumption that is a minimum of 25% of the total energy consumption for the baseline building."
In the final version of the the LEED 2.2 dated October 2005 that same verbiage had been changed to 
"Must be compared against a baseline building that complies with Appendix G to Standard 90.1-2004 (without amendments). The default process energy cost is 25% of the total energy"
 I think the intent is that the default process energy cost used in the calculation of LEED credits for V2.2 is a max of 25%.  If your building has 60% process energy you would only have to count that portion of process energy that equals 25% of the total energy.  This would level the playing field for all buildings regardless of how much process energy is used.  If a building uses less than 25% then you have to justify the legitimacy of that claim.  
I think someone should submit a CIR asking whether this is the correct interpretation of the Credit.

All, 
 
We agree that the MINIMUM default process energy cost is 25%, but that if it is larger than 25%, the entire value shall be considered as part of the Proposed Building Performance (energy cost), and likewise for the Baseline Building Performance (energy cost).  This conclusion is based on clarification that we received for a LEED project that we're working on.  We cannot say why the CIR is not on the USGBC website, but we're following up on that issue.  We also agree that the process energy cost can be less than 25% of the total building energy cost if documentation supports such a claim.  The LEED v2.2 Ref. Guide (p. 174) states that a savings can be shown in process energy cost between the Proposed Building Performance and Baseline Building Performance via Exceptional Calculation Methods.
 
In addition we concur with Varkie on the fact that the inclusion of ALL process energy does "penalize" a building with respect to improving building design and energy efficiency - the apparent intent of EAc1.  According to the LEED v2.2 Reference Guide, "the intent of LEED-NC is to assist in the creation of high performance, healthful, durable, affordable and environmentally sound commercial and institutional buildings." While it is debatable that LEED did not intend to include building types with significant process loads, it does seem unnecessarily exclusive of these building types, because the stated intent is to improve the design and construction of buildings, not processes. In addition, LEED is now considering making a minimum number of energy credits mandatory in a future version, which will virtually exclude certain building types from being certified. It seems that it would be better and more in line with LEED's own stated goals if more buildings were encouraged to become certified even if the process energy used is high in comparison to the building energy used.
 
With that in mind, it does seem appropriate and reasonable that process energy should be accounted for in some manner, especially where the loads affect HVAC equipment capacities and energy costs associated with space conditioning. However, in order to not exclude high process load buildings from certification, it seems more appropriate to only include the costs specific to process energy up to 25% (used because 25% is already identified) of the total energy costs. The additional process energy costs could be reported separately but excluded from the Percentage Improvement calculation unless additional savings were pursued through an Exceptional Calculation.  
 
Yes, it's good that LEED may be used to drive clients to consider more efficient processes, but it appears that a potential consequence of the current approach is to dissuade certain project types from pursuing LEED certification because a high performance building design does not necessarily offset the impacts of a large process load baseline. The focus should be on non-process building efficiency.

Hi Folks,
 
By identical it means that the energy consumption should be identical not the percentage of the total.
 
The USGBC certainly did not intend to exclude high process load building types from savings.  It is true that high process load buildings would not be able to attain the higher percentages without addressing the process loads.  It is also true that all energy consumption contributes to environmental issues surrounding energy use, not just the building related consumption.  We therefore felt it was critical to include all energy use.  
 
As we are all aware there are many energy saving options for most process loads.  The problem is the establishment of a baseline for many of these items.  The EA TAG recognizes this as a significant issue and we are discussing ways to address the situation.
 
In the mean time I would suggest that project teams strive to make all building energy systems as energy efficient as possible and follow the exceptional calculation method to show savings for process loads in the LEED certification review process.

The interpretation of what ?default? means is the key.  Since the second provision says that baseline and proposed process loads shall be identical, if the design process loads are 60%, than the baseline should be 60%, unless you ignore the second provision.  
 
If the interpretation of the ?default? is that baseline is always 25%* even if the design process is greater than 25%, than the two cited paragraphs are in contradiction in many cases. (*except for the special case of documented process usage less than 25%)
 
I?m not a lawyer, but it seems these need to reconciled so both paragraphs make sense, or are changed. 
 
My guess/hope is that the USGBC did not intend to exclude all high process load buildings from showing savings under EAc1.

The exact wording of the LEED v2.2 requirements may be helpful in moving this discussion forward.  Per LEED EAc1 requirements:

"The default process energy cost (must) be 25% of the total energy cost for the Baseline building.  For buildings where the process energy cost is less than 25% of the baseline building energy cost, the LEED submittal must include supporting documentation substantiating that process energy inputs are appropriate. "
...
"For EA Credit 1, process loads shall be identical for both the Baseline building performance rating and for the Proposed building performance rating.  However, project teams may follow the Exceptional Calculation Method (ASHRAE 90.1-2004 G2.5) to document measures that reduce process loads.  Documentation of process load energy savings shall include a list of the assumptions made for both the base and proposed design, and theoretical or empirical information supporting these assumptions. "

Buildings with 60% process energy cost probably will likely be negatively impacted by these modeling requirements (it is probable that these buildings will have a tougher time showing substantial Percentage Energy Improvement than buildings having only 25% process loads).  However, if the project can demonstrate that energy improvements have been made to the process energy systems versus standard practice, then the energy savings achieved through these process system efficiency measures can be used to document improved Percentage Improvement using the Exceptional Calculation Methodology.  As Leonard mentioned, the process energy will also impact cooling loads substantially, and improvements to the cooling equipment and controls would also help the overall building performance.

Vaibhav: Your reference makes the situation worse.    
The LEED energy savings rating system using the bottom line percent savings over baseline appears to penalize buildings with high process loads when you also consider LEED-NC Version 2.2 EA Credit 1 page 174 "The default process energy cost is 25% of the total energy cost for the baseline building".  
What has the process energy cost (or the process energy use) got to do with building design related to energy efficiency (architecture-envelope, lighting, HVAC, DHW) except power supply for the process?  The process energy within an office building can vary from 0.5 w/sf  (minimal use of computers and office equipment) to more than 6.0 w/sf for a financial/trading (Wall Street) type of building.  If the baseline process energy is limited to 25% percent of total and the proposed process energy use is more than 60% of the total then does this mean that the building design is energy inefficient and does not qualify for LEED certification?
Process energy could be part of the analysis if there is a baseline standard for various types of computer and office equipment (varies considerably and hard to define and prescribe for the numerous types processes that occur in just office buildings) and the equivalent proposed equipment is more efficient.  This comes under "Exceptional Calculation Method" category along with several other energy efficient building design options such as double-wall buildings for which you get 1 point (I think).
According to LEED-NC Version 2.2 EA Credit 1 page 174 "process energy is considered to include, but is not limited to, office & general miscellaneous equipment, computers, elevators & escalators, kitchen cooking & refrigeration, laundry washing & drying, lighting exempt from lighting power allowance (e.g. lighting integral to medical equipment) and other (e.g. waterfall pumps).  Do all submissions for LEED certification include all this.  At the construction documents submission stage, what is the level of modeling detail that is required regarding floor spaces and zones and all the systems, plant and equipment shown on the drawings and specifications.  Can you use eQUEST, select the type of building, and let the "Wizard" do the zoning and assume most of the baseline data?   I don't think we are all playing the same game, on the same level playing field and using the same rules to show percent energy savings for LEED certification.
I also have some reservations about how various energy saving systems are modeled with different computer programs.  The programs should be studied and compared with the same case studies of different types of buildings with different systems and plants and showing how each program should be used to demonstrate energy savings from different energy conservation measures such as UFAD.  
Building operation data can now be viewed on the web, collected for meaurement & verification (M&V) and can be used to check computer modeling results.  In the case of a M&V project at IIT, the web based control systems show mainly temperatures.  Sub-meters and data loggers should be included in the control specifications so that the performance of the major systems, plant & equipment can be monitored separately and compared with computer results.  At the moment we are comparing the building utility meter reading with the bottom line building energy use calculated by the computer program. 
Process loads do not affect energy code and Std-90 compliance since "percentages" are not involved.

Varkie,

 

Something we have been noticing in schools lately is a high receptacle load, which we believe is attributable to increased usage of computers, approaching and in some areas exceeding 5 W per square foot -- the kinds of loads I used to figure for "technology intensive" office areas just a few years ago.

 

In researching an energy question for a school today, I came across this web page and case study which I thought was relevant to your question:

 

http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=power_mgt.pr_power_management

 

http://www.energystar.gov/ia/products/power_mgt/North_Thurston_Case_Study.pdf

 

Essentially they summarize how, by consistently implementing power management on computer monitors and CPUs using a simple utility program, a cost savings of an estimated $15-$30 per computer per year can be realized (on personal workstations I would add, not systems required to be continuously online).  Multiplied across thousands of computers, the bottom line annual savings can be substantial.

 

How to account for this in energy modeling software I have a general idea:

 

1) Assign the baseline receptacle load to "occupied hours"; e.g. 5 W/SF 'always on'

2) Assign a diversified receptacle load schedule to the alternate analyses

 

But quantifying the diversified load schedule is the hard part -- it will no doubt vary significantly depending on the occupancy.  Though not fully developed, this may provide a starting point for one method to reduce process electrical loads in a LEED analysis.

LEED-NC Version 2.2 page 173 "Optimize Energy Performance" states "Demonstrate a percentage improvement in the proposed building performance -- " and  "For the purpose of this analysis, process energy is considered to include, but is not limited to, office and general miscellaneous equipment, computers, elevators & escalators, kitchen cooking & refrigeration, laundry washing & drying --- "
On page 174 "For EA Credit 1, process loads shall be identical for both the baseline building performance and the proposed building performance"
Assuming the same space process load is used in the baseline and proposed, then a building with a receptacle load density of say 1.0 w/sf will produce a much greater percent savings compared to the same building with a receptacle load density of say 6 w/sf.
Page 173 "must comply with the mandatory provisions (Sections --- ) in Standard 90.1-2004 (without amendments)"  There is no mention of Standards 62 for ventilation & occupancy density or Standard 55 for indoor comfort conditions.  Does this mean that the baseline can be based on the proposed ventilation, occupancy density and indoor comfort conditions?  According to Standard 62-2004 the occupancy density for general office space is 200 sf/P (from 142 sf/P in 62-2001 and I think 100 sf/P earlier).  This produces a low percent system outdoor air and energy conservation measures such as "occupancy based ventilation" and "outdoor air to relief air heat recovery" have little effect.  Std 62-2004 (also Std 90.1-2004 for lighting) provides design criteria for a limited number of space types such as a prison cell (improved from 50 sf/P & 20 cfm/P in 62-2001 to 40 sf/P & 10 cfm/P in 62-2004) .  This makes it difficult to determine baselin e conditions using Std 62.
I am looking at a financial institution building with high occupancy and receptacle load densities.

Varkie, I can see merits for the 2.1 method and the 2.2 method.  On the one hand, the process loads are to some degree out of our control.  But on the other hand, if you have a building with such massive load density why would the rating system want to exclude all of that energy from sustainable practices?

 

I like the idea of consistency when considering all of the energy for energy optimization, on-site renewables and green power - there are projects out there that might earn fewer EAC1 points under v2.2 than under 2.1.  The percentage savings were changed between the versions so it's hard to say if it is more or less likely to earn a certain amount of EAC1 points - I would be interested to see a summary if the data is available about EAC1 points under v2.1 compared to v2.2.  Probably about the same?

 

For a high load density building like yours - definitely going to be harder.  The only suggestion as far as EAC1 points that I could offer would that if your design has receptacle load at 6 W/ft2 there is probably a significant diversity in that load, maybe it won't turn out as badly as you fear.

 

In regard to ventilation, you are going to use the outside air requirements from the proposed design and apply that outside air quantity to both models.  There isn't a "baseline ventilation rate" - use equal CFM of OA for both models.  Also, OA may be determined from local building codes rather than ASHRAE - that would also apply equally to both models.

 

The one exception would be that Demand Control Ventilation could potentially be used in the proposed model to reduce OA if DCV isn't required prescriptively, and if your minimum OA from code is less than what is required by ASHRAE 62.

Hope this helps!

		Varkie,
		
		 
		Something we have been noticing in schools lately is a
high receptacle load, which we believe is attributable to increased
usage of computers, approaching and in some areas exceeding 5 W per
square foot -- the kinds of loads I used to figure for "technology
intensive" office areas just a few years ago.
		 
		In researching an energy question for a school today, I
came across this web page and case study which I thought was relevant to
your question:
		 
	
http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=power_mgt.pr_power_management
		 
	
http://www.energystar.gov/ia/products/power_mgt/North_Thurston_Case_Stud
y.pdf
<http://www.energystar.gov/ia/products/power_mgt/North_Thurston_Case_Stu
dy.pdf> 
		 
		Essentially they summarize how, by consistently
implementing power management on computer monitors and CPUs using a
simple utility program, a cost savings of an estimated $15-$30 per
computer per year can be realized (on personal workstations I would add,
not systems required to be continuously online).  Multiplied across
thousands of computers, the bottom line annual savings can be
substantial.
		 
		How to account for this in energy modeling software I
have a general idea:
		 
		1) Assign the baseline receptacle load to "occupied
hours"; e.g. 5 W/SF 'always on'
		2) Assign a diversified receptacle load schedule to the
alternate analyses
		 
		But quantifying the diversified load schedule is the
hard part -- it will no doubt vary significantly depending on the
occupancy.  Though not fully developed, this may provide a starting
point for one method to reduce process electrical loads in a LEED
analysis.

		LEED-NC Version 2.2 page 173 "Optimize Energy
Performance" states "Demonstrate a percentage improvement in the
proposed building performance -- " and  "For the purpose of this
analysis, process energy is considered to include, but is not limited
to, office and general miscellaneous equipment, computers, elevators &
escalators, kitchen cooking & refrigeration, laundry washing & drying
--- "

		On page 174 "For EA Credit 1, process loads shall be
identical for both the baseline building performance and the proposed
building performance"

		Assuming the same space process load is used in the
baseline and proposed, then a building with a receptacle load density of
say 1.0 w/sf will produce a much greater percent savings compared to the
same building with a receptacle load density of say 6 w/sf.

		Page 173 "must comply with the mandatory provisions
(Sections --- ) in Standard 90.1-2004 (without amendments)"  There is no
mention of Standards 62 for ventilation & occupancy density or Standard
55 for indoor comfort conditions.  Does this mean that the baseline can
be based on the proposed ventilation, occupancy density and indoor
comfort conditions?  According to Standard 62-2004 the occupancy density
for general office space is 200 sf/P (from 142 sf/P in 62-2001 and I
think 100 sf/P earlier).  This produces a low percent system outdoor air
and energy conservation measures such as "occupancy based ventilation"
and "outdoor air to relief air heat recovery" have little effect.  Std
62-2004 (also Std 90.1-2004 for lighting) provides design criteria for a
limited number of space types such as a prison cell (improved from 50
sf/P & 20 cfm/P in 62-2001 to 40 sf/P & 10 cfm/P in 62-2004) .  This
makes it difficult to determine baselin e conditions using Std 62.

		I am looking at a financial institution building with
high occupancy and receptacle load densities.

		Varkie, I can see merits for the 2.1 method and the 2.2
method.  On the one hand, the process loads are to some degree out of
our control.  But on the other hand, if you have a building with such
massive load density why would the rating system want to exclude all of
that energy from sustainable practices?

		 
		I like the idea of consistency when considering all of
the energy for energy optimization, on-site renewables and green power -
there are projects out there that might earn fewer EAC1 points under
v2.2 than under 2.1.  The percentage savings were changed between the
versions so it's hard to say if it is more or less likely to earn a
certain amount of EAC1 points - I would be interested to see a summary
if the data is available about EAC1 points under v2.1 compared to v2.2.
Probably about the same?
		 
		For a high load density building like yours - definitely
going to be harder.  The only suggestion as far as EAC1 points that I
could offer would that if your design has receptacle load at 6 W/ft2
there is probably a significant diversity in that load, maybe it won't
turn out as badly as you fear.
		 
		In regard to ventilation, you are going to use the
outside air requirements from the proposed design and apply that outside
air quantity to both models.  There isn't a "baseline ventilation rate"
- use equal CFM of OA for both models.  Also, OA may be determined from
local building codes rather than ASHRAE - that would also apply equally
to both models.
		 
		The one exception would be that Demand Control
Ventilation could potentially be used in the proposed model to reduce OA
if DCV isn't required prescriptively, and if your minimum OA from code
is less than what is required by ASHRAE 62.
		
		Hope this helps!

Hi Folks,
 
By identical it means that the energy consumption should be identical not
the percentage of the total.
 
The USGBC certainly did not intend to exclude high process load building
types from savings.  It is true that high process load buildings would not
be able to attain the higher percentages without addressing the process
loads.  It is also true that all energy consumption contributes to
environmental issues surrounding energy use, not just the building related
consumption.  We therefore felt it was critical to include all energy use.  
 
As we are all aware there are many energy saving options for most process
loads.  The problem is the establishment of a baseline for many of these
items.  The EA TAG recognizes this as a significant issue and we are
discussing ways to address the situation.
 
In the mean time I would suggest that project teams strive to make all
building energy systems as energy efficient as possible and follow the
exceptional calculation method to show savings for process loads in the LEED
certification review process.

The interpretation of what "default" means is the key.  Since the second
provision says that baseline and proposed process loads shall be identical,
if the design process loads are 60%, than the baseline should be 60%, unless
you ignore the second provision.  
 
If the interpretation of the "default" is that baseline is always 25%* even
if the design process is greater than 25%, than the two cited paragraphs are
in contradiction in many cases. (*except for the special case of documented
process usage less than 25%)
 
I'm not a lawyer, but it seems these need to reconciled so both paragraphs
make sense, or are changed. 
 
My guess/hope is that the USGBC did not intend to exclude all high process
load buildings from showing savings under EAc1.

The exact wording of the LEED v2.2 requirements may be helpful in moving
this discussion forward.  Per LEED EAc1 requirements:

"The default process energy cost (must) be 25% of the total energy cost for
the Baseline building.  For buildings where the process energy cost is less
than 25% of the baseline building energy cost, the LEED submittal must
include supporting documentation substantiating that process energy inputs
are appropriate. "
...
"For EA Credit 1, process loads shall be identical for both the Baseline
building performance rating and for the Proposed building performance
rating.  However, project teams may follow the Exceptional Calculation
Method (ASHRAE 90.1-2004 G2.5) to document measures that reduce process
loads.  Documentation of process load energy savings shall include a list of
the assumptions made for both the base and proposed design, and theoretical
or empirical information supporting these assumptions. "

Buildings with 60% process energy cost probably will likely be negatively
impacted by these modeling requirements (it is probable that these buildings
will have a tougher time showing substantial Percentage Energy Improvement
than buildings having only 25% process loads).  However, if the project can
demonstrate that energy improvements have been made to the process energy
systems versus standard practice, then the energy savings achieved through
these process system efficiency measures can be used to document improved
Percentage Improvement using the Exceptional Calculation Methodology.  As
Leonard mentioned, the process energy will also impact cooling loads
substantially, and improvements to the cooling equipment and controls would
also help the overall building performance.

Vaibhav: Your reference makes the situation worse.    
The LEED energy savings rating system using the bottom line percent savings
over baseline appears to penalize buildings with high process loads when you
also consider LEED-NC Version 2.2 EA Credit 1 page 174 "The default process
energy cost is 25% of the total energy cost for the baseline building".  
What has the process energy cost (or the process energy use) got to do with
building design related to energy efficiency (architecture-envelope,
lighting, HVAC, DHW) except power supply for the process?  The process
energy within an office building can vary from 0.5 w/sf  (minimal use of
computers and office equipment) to more than 6.0 w/sf for a
financial/trading (Wall Street) type of building.  If the baseline process
energy is limited to 25% percent of total and the proposed process energy
use is more than 60% of the total then does this mean that the building
design is energy inefficient and does not qualify for LEED certification?
Process energy could be part of the analysis if there is a baseline standard
for various types of computer and office equipment (varies considerably and
hard to define and prescribe for the numerous types processes that occur in
just office buildings) and the equivalent proposed equipment is more
efficient.  This comes under "Exceptional Calculation Method" category along
with several other energy efficient building design options such as
double-wall buildings for which you get 1 point (I think).
According to LEED-NC Version 2.2 EA Credit 1 page 174 "process energy is
considered to include, but is not limited to, office & general miscellaneous
equipment, computers, elevators & escalators, kitchen cooking &
refrigeration, laundry washing & drying, lighting exempt from lighting power
allowance (e.g. lighting integral to medical equipment) and other (e.g.
waterfall pumps).  Do all submissions for LEED certification include all
this.  At the construction documents submission stage, what is the level of
modeling detail that is required regarding floor spaces and zones and all
the systems, plant and equipment shown on the drawings and specifications.
Can you use eQUEST, select the type of building, and let the "Wizard" do the
zoning and assume most of the baseline data?   I don't think we are all
playing the same game, on the same level playing field and using the same
rules to show percent energy savings for LEED certification.
I also have some reservations about how various energy saving systems are
modeled with different computer programs.  The programs should be studied
and compared with the same case studies of different types of buildings with
different systems and plants and showing how each program should be used to
demonstrate energy savings from different energy conservation measures such
as UFAD.  
Building operation data can now be viewed on the web, collected for
meaurement & verification (M&V) and can be used to check computer modeling
results.  In the case of a M&V project at IIT, the web based control systems
show mainly temperatures.  Sub-meters and data loggers should be included in
the control specifications so that the performance of the major systems,
plant & equipment can be monitored separately and compared with computer
results.  At the moment we are comparing the building utility meter reading
with the bottom line building energy use calculated by the computer program.

Process loads do not affect energy code and Std-90 compliance since
"percentages" are not involved.

I agree with Vaibhav.

Though, the following comment is for someone who does not make it to 25% as proposed in the design: In the past, for LEED 2.2 we have quantified the probable diversity of the receptacles to a reasonable detail. We found that no matter what the stretch of imagination the building will not exceed 13% of total energy cost. Having shown our case, we earned  the credits we sought for. "God is in the details" -- or probable details (shown in an exception calculation)!

Page 173 "must comply with the mandatory provisions (Sections --- ) in Standard 90.1-2004 (without amendments)"  There is no mention of Standards 62 for ventilation & occupancy density or Standard 55 for indoor comfort conditions.  Does this mean that the baseline can be based on the proposed ventilation, occupancy density and indoor comfort conditions?  According to Standard 62-2004 the occupancy density for general office space is 200 sf/P (from 142 sf/P in 62-2001 and I think 100 sf/P earlier).  This produces a low percent system outdoor air and energy conservation measures such as "occupancy based ventilation" and "outdoor air to relief air heat recovery" have little effect.  Std 62-2004 (also Std 90.1-2004 for lighting) provides design criteria for a limited number of space types such as a prison cell (improved from 50 sf/P & 20 cfm/P in 
62-2001 to 40 sf/P & 10 cfm/P in 62-2004) .  This makes it difficult to determine baselin e conditions using Std 62.

I am looking at a financial institution building with high occupancy and receptacle load densities.

The interpretation of what "default" means is the key.  Since the second
provision says that baseline and proposed process loads shall be
identical, if the design process loads are 60%, than the baseline should
be 60%, unless you ignore the second provision.  

 

If the interpretation of the "default" is that baseline is always 25%*
even if the design process is greater than 25%, than the two cited
paragraphs are in contradiction in many cases. (*except for the special
case of documented process usage less than 25%)

 

I'm not a lawyer, but it seems these need to reconciled so both
paragraphs make sense, or are changed. 

 

My guess/hope is that the USGBC did not intend to exclude all high
process load buildings from showing savings under EAc1.

The exact wording of the LEED v2.2 requirements may be helpful in moving
this discussion forward.  Per LEED EAc1 requirements:

"The default process energy cost (must) be 25% of the total energy cost
for the Baseline building.  For buildings where the process energy cost
is less than 25% of the baseline building energy cost, the LEED
submittal must include supporting documentation substantiating that
process energy inputs are appropriate. "
...
"For EA Credit 1, process loads shall be identical for both the Baseline
building performance rating and for the Proposed building performance
rating.  However, project teams may follow the Exceptional Calculation
Method (ASHRAE 90.1-2004 G2.5) to document measures that reduce process
loads.  Documentation of process load energy savings shall include a
list of the assumptions made for both the base and proposed design, and
theoretical or empirical information supporting these assumptions. "

Buildings with 60% process energy cost probably will likely be
negatively impacted by these modeling requirements (it is probable that
these buildings will have a tougher time showing substantial Percentage
Energy Improvement than buildings having only 25% process loads).
However, if the project can demonstrate that energy improvements have
been made to the process energy systems versus standard practice, then
the energy savings achieved through these process system efficiency
measures can be used to document improved Percentage Improvement using
the Exceptional Calculation Methodology.  As Leonard mentioned, the
process energy will also impact cooling loads substantially, and
improvements to the cooling equipment and controls would also help the
overall building performance.

Vaibhav: Your reference makes the situation worse.    

The LEED energy savings rating system using the bottom line percent
savings over baseline appears to penalize buildings with high process
loads when you also consider LEED-NC Version 2.2 EA Credit 1 page 174
"The default process energy cost is 25% of the total energy cost for the
baseline building".  

What has the process energy cost (or the process energy use) got to do
with building design related to energy efficiency
(architecture-envelope, lighting, HVAC, DHW) except power supply for the
process?  The process energy within an office building can vary from 0.5
w/sf  (minimal use of computers and office equipment) to more than 6.0
w/sf for a financial/trading (Wall Street) type of building.  If the
baseline process energy is limited to 25% percent of total and the
proposed process energy use is more than 60% of the total then does this
mean that the building design is energy inefficient and does not qualify
for LEED certification?

Process energy could be part of the analysis if there is a baseline
standard for various types of computer and office equipment (varies
considerably and hard to define and prescribe for the numerous types
processes that occur in just office buildings) and the equivalent
proposed equipment is more efficient.  This comes under "Exceptional
Calculation Method" category along with several other energy efficient
building design options such as double-wall buildings for which you get
1 point (I think).

According to LEED-NC Version 2.2 EA Credit 1 page 174 "process energy is
considered to include, but is not limited to, office & general
miscellaneous equipment, computers, elevators & escalators, kitchen
cooking & refrigeration, laundry washing & drying, lighting exempt from
lighting power allowance (e.g. lighting integral to medical equipment)
and other (e.g. waterfall pumps).  Do all submissions for LEED
certification include all this.  At the construction documents
submission stage, what is the level of modeling detail that is required
regarding floor spaces and zones and all the systems, plant and
equipment shown on the drawings and specifications.  Can you use eQUEST,
select the type of building, and let the "Wizard" do the zoning and
assume most of the baseline data?   I don't think we are all playing the
same game, on the same level playing field and using the same rules to
show percent energy savings for LEED certification.

I also have some reservations about how various energy saving systems
are modeled with different computer programs.  The programs should be
studied and compared with the same case studies of different types of
buildings with different systems and plants and showing how each program
should be used to demonstrate energy savings from different energy
conservation measures such as UFAD.  

Building operation data can now be viewed on the web, collected for
meaurement & verification (M&V) and can be used to check computer
modeling results.  In the case of a M&V project at IIT, the web based
control systems show mainly temperatures.  Sub-meters and data loggers
should be included in the control specifications so that the performance
of the major systems, plant & equipment can be monitored separately and
compared with computer results.  At the moment we are comparing the
building utility meter reading with the bottom line building energy use
calculated by the computer program. 

Process loads do not affect energy code and Std-90 compliance since
"percentages" are not involved.

Varkie,

 

Something we have been noticing in schools lately is a high receptacle
load, which we believe is attributable to increased usage of computers,
approaching and in some areas exceeding 5 W per square foot -- the kinds
of loads I used to figure for "technology intensive" office areas just a
few years ago.

 

In researching an energy question for a school today, I came across this
web page and case study which I thought was relevant to your question:

 

http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=power_mgt.pr_power_management

 

 
<http://www.energystar.gov/ia/products/power_mgt/North_Thurston_Case_Stu
dy.pdf>
http://www.energystar.gov/ia/products/power_mgt/North_Thurston_Case_Stud
y.pdf

 

Essentially they summarize how, by consistently implementing power
management on computer monitors and CPUs using a simple utility program,
a cost savings of an estimated $15-$30 per computer per year can be
realized (on personal workstations I would add, not systems required to
be continuously online).  Multiplied across thousands of computers, the
bottom line annual savings can be substantial.

 

How to account for this in energy modeling software I have a general
idea:

 

1) Assign the baseline receptacle load to "occupied hours"; e.g. 5 W/SF
'always on'

2) Assign a diversified receptacle load schedule to the alternate
analyses

 

But quantifying the diversified load schedule is the hard part -- it
will no doubt vary significantly depending on the occupancy.  Though not
fully developed, this may provide a starting point for one method to
reduce process electrical loads in a LEED analysis.

Varkie, I can see merits for the 2.1 method and the 2.2 method.  On the
one hand, the process loads are to some degree out of our control.  But
on the other hand, if you have a building with such massive load density
why would the rating system want to exclude all of that energy from
sustainable practices?

 

I like the idea of consistency when considering all of the energy for
energy optimization, on-site renewables and green power - there are
projects out there that might earn fewer EAC1 points under v2.2 than
under 2.1.  The percentage savings were changed between the versions so
it's hard to say if it is more or less likely to earn a certain amount
of EAC1 points - I would be interested to see a summary if the data is
available about EAC1 points under v2.1 compared to v2.2.  Probably about
the same?

 

For a high load density building like yours - definitely going to be
harder.  The only suggestion as far as EAC1 points that I could offer
would that if your design has receptacle load at 6 W/ft2 there is
probably a significant diversity in that load, maybe it won't turn out
as badly as you fear.

 

In regard to ventilation, you are going to use the outside air
requirements from the proposed design and apply that outside air
quantity to both models.  There isn't a "baseline ventilation rate" -
use equal CFM of OA for both models.  Also, OA may be determined from
local building codes rather than ASHRAE - that would also apply equally
to both models.

 

The one exception would be that Demand Control Ventilation could
potentially be used in the proposed model to reduce OA if DCV isn't
required prescriptively, and if your minimum OA from code is less than
what is required by ASHRAE 62.

Hope this helps!

 

David

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Process Loads and LEED

LEED-NC Version 2.2 page 173 "Optimize Energy Performance" states
"Demonstrate a percentage improvement in the proposed building performance
-- " and  "For the purpose of this analysis, process energy is considered to
include, but is not limited to, office and general miscellaneous equipment,
computers, elevators & escalators, kitchen cooking & refrigeration, laundry
washing & drying --- "

On page 174 "For EA Credit 1, process loads shall be identical for both the
baseline building performance and the proposed building performance"

Assuming the same space process load is used in the baseline and proposed,
then a building with a receptacle load density of say 1.0 w/sf will produce
a much greater percent savings compared to the same building with a
receptacle load density of say 6 w/sf.

Page 173 "must comply with the mandatory provisions (Sections --- ) in
Standard 90.1-2004 (without amendments)"  There is no mention of Standards
62 for ventilation & occupancy density or Standard 55 for indoor comfort
conditions.  Does this mean that the baseline can be based on the proposed
ventilation, occupancy density and indoor comfort conditions?  According to
Standard 62-2004 the occupancy density for general office space is 200 sf/P
(from 142 sf/P in 62-2001 and I think 100 sf/P earlier).  This produces a
low percent system outdoor air and energy conservation measures such as
"occupancy based ventilation" and "outdoor air to relief air heat recovery"
have little effect.  Std 62-2004 (also Std 90.1-2004 for lighting) provides
design criteria for a limited number of space types such as a prison cell
(improved from 50 sf/P & 20 cfm/P in 62-2001 to 40 sf/P & 10 cfm/P in
62-2004) .  This makes it difficult to determine baselin e conditions using
Std 62.

I am looking at a financial institution building with high occupancy and
receptacle load densities.

Varkie, I can see merits for the 2.1 method and the 2.2 method.  On the one
hand, the process loads are to some degree out of our control.  But on the
other hand, if you have a building with such massive load density why would
the rating system want to exclude all of that energy from sustainable
practices?

 

I like the idea of consistency when considering all of the energy for energy
optimization, on-site renewables and green power - there are projects out
there that might earn fewer EAC1 points under v2.2 than under 2.1.  The
percentage savings were changed between the versions so it's hard to say if
it is more or less likely to earn a certain amount of EAC1 points - I would
be interested to see a summary if the data is available about EAC1 points
under v2.1 compared to v2.2.  Probably about the same?

 

For a high load density building like yours - definitely going to be harder.
The only suggestion as far as EAC1 points that I could offer would that if
your design has receptacle load at 6 W/ft2 there is probably a significant
diversity in that load, maybe it won't turn out as badly as you fear.

 

In regard to ventilation, you are going to use the outside air requirements
from the proposed design and apply that outside air quantity to both models.
There isn't a "baseline ventilation rate" - use equal CFM of OA for both
models.  Also, OA may be determined from local building codes rather than
ASHRAE - that would also apply equally to both models.

 

The one exception would be that Demand Control Ventilation could potentially
be used in the proposed model to reduce OA if DCV isn't required
prescriptively, and if your minimum OA from code is less than what is
required by ASHRAE 62.

Hope this helps!

 

David

The exact wording of the LEED v2.2 requirements may be helpful in moving
this discussion forward.  Per LEED EAc1 requirements:

"The default process energy cost (must) be 25% of the total energy cost for
the Baseline building.  For buildings where the process energy cost is less
than 25% of the baseline building energy cost, the LEED submittal must
include supporting documentation substantiating that process energy inputs
are appropriate."
...
"For EA Credit 1, process loads shall be identical for both the Baseline
building performance rating and for the Proposed building performance
rating.  However, project teams may follow the Exceptional Calculation
Method (ASHRAE 90.1-2004 G2.5) to document measures that reduce process
loads.  Documentation of process load energy savings shall include a list of
the assumptions made for both the base and proposed design, and theoretical
or empirical information supporting these assumptions."

Buildings with 60% process energy cost probably will likely be negatively
impacted by these modeling requirements (it is probable that these buildings
will have a tougher time showing substantial Percentage Energy Improvement
than buildings having only 25% process loads).  However, if the project can
demonstrate that energy improvements have been made to the process energy
systems versus standard practice, then the energy savings achieved through
these process system efficiency measures can be used to document improved
Percentage Improvement using the Exceptional Calculation Methodology.  As
Leonard mentioned, the process energy will also impact cooling loads
substantially, and improvements to the cooling equipment and controls would
also help the overall building performance.

My understanding of the 25% default provision in LEED 2.2 for EAc1 is that
this is a minimum for the baseline and the proposed.  The credit language
says that to go less than 25% of baseline energy cost (appears to imply for
baseline and design) that this be documented.  

 

Separately, further down, the credit language states that the process loads
shall be identical in the design and the base and that credit for process
savings in the proposed design that result in energy cost savings can be
documented by Exceptional Calculation.  

 

The 25% came about to create a basis for having the 2.2 EAc1 points start
out calibrated to provided similar point results when non-regulated loads
were added to the scoring while they were excluded under LEED 2.1. 

 

I believe this should be interpreted that the models have the same process
loads in baseline and design, and that this be set to a minimum of 25%
unless design documentation supports a different process load to be used in
both baseline and proposed.  

 

Separately, savings credit for proposed can be taken with Exceptional
Calculation.

 

Has anyone done a CIR to clarify the intent of this muddled languae in the
2.2. reference guide?  This is not an Appendix G problem but in the LEED
2.2. Reference Guide.

Vaibhav: Your reference makes the situation worse.    

The LEED energy savings rating system using the bottom line percent savings
over baseline appears to penalize buildings with high process loads when you
also consider LEED-NC Version 2.2 EA Credit 1 page 174 "The default process
energy cost is 25% of the total energy cost for the baseline building".  

What has the process energy cost (or the process energy use) got to do with
building design related to energy efficiency (architecture-envelope,
lighting, HVAC, DHW) except power supply for the process?  The process
energy within an office building can vary from 0.5 w/sf  (minimal use of
computers and office equipment) to more than 6.0 w/sf for a
financial/trading (Wall Street) type of building.  If the baseline process
energy is limited to 25% percent of total and the proposed process energy
use is more than 60% of the total then does this mean that the building
design is energy inefficient and does not qualify for LEED certification?

Process energy could be part of the analysis if there is a baseline standard
for various types of computer and office equipment (varies considerably and
hard to define and prescribe for the numerous types processes that occur in
just office buildings) and the equivalent proposed equipment is more
efficient.  This comes under "Exceptional Calculation Method" category along
with several other energy efficient building design options such as
double-wall buildings for which you get 1 point (I think).

According to LEED-NC Version 2.2 EA Credit 1 page 174 "process energy is
considered to include, but is not limited to, office & general miscellaneous
equipment, computers, elevators & escalators, kitchen cooking &
refrigeration, laundry washing & drying, lighting exempt from lighting power
allowance (e.g. lighting integral to medical equipment) and other (e.g.
waterfall pumps).  Do all submissions for LEED certification include all
this.  At the construction documents submission stage, what is the level of
modeling detail that is required regarding floor spaces and zones and all
the systems, plant and equipment shown on the drawings and specifications.
Can you use eQUEST, select the type of building, and let the "Wizard" do the
zoning and assume most of the baseline data?   I don't think we are all
playing the same game, on the same level playing field and using the same
rules to show percent energy savings for LEED certification.

I also have some reservations about how various energy saving systems are
modeled with different computer programs.  The programs should be studied
and compared with the same case studies of different types of buildings with
different systems and plants and showing how each program should be used to
demonstrate energy savings from different energy conservation measures such
as UFAD.  

Building operation data can now be viewed on the web, collected for
meaurement & verification (M&V) and can be used to check computer modeling
results.  In the case of a M&V project at IIT, the web based control systems
show mainly temperatures.  Sub-meters and data loggers should be included in
the control specifications so that the performance of the major systems,
plant & equipment can be monitored separately and compared with computer
results.  At the moment we are comparing the building utility meter reading
with the bottom line building energy use calculated by the computer program.


Process loads do not affect energy code and Std-90 compliance since
"percentages" are not involved.

However I wanted to point out that for a LEED energy analysis, process
energy has to be maintained at 25% of total energy cost of the Baseline
Building Performance ( LEED- 2.2 Ref Guide page 182). I prefer taking
exceptional calculatins for process energy to simplify the calculations as
well as the review.

Hope this helps.

Varkie,

 

Something we have been noticing in schools lately is a high receptacle load,
which we believe is attributable to increased usage of computers,
approaching and in some areas exceeding 5 W per square foot -- the kinds of
loads I used to figure for "technology intensive" office areas just a few
years ago.

 

In researching an energy question for a school today, I came across this web
page and case study which I thought was relevant to your question:

 

http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=power_mgt.pr_power_management

 

 
<http://www.energystar.gov/ia/products/power_mgt/North_Thurston_Case_Study.p
df>
http://www.energystar.gov/ia/products/power_mgt/North_Thurston_Case_Study.pd
f

 

Essentially they summarize how, by consistently implementing power
management on computer monitors and CPUs using a simple utility program, a
cost savings of an estimated $15-$30 per computer per year can be realized
(on personal workstations I would add, not systems required to be
continuously online).  Multiplied across thousands of computers, the bottom
line annual savings can be substantial.

 

How to account for this in energy modeling software I have a general idea:

 

1) Assign the baseline receptacle load to "occupied hours"; e.g. 5 W/SF
'always on'

2) Assign a diversified receptacle load schedule to the alternate analyses

 

But quantifying the diversified load schedule is the hard part -- it will no
doubt vary significantly depending on the occupancy.  Though not fully
developed, this may provide a starting point for one method to reduce
process electrical loads in a LEED analysis.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Process Loads and LEED

LEED-NC Version 2.2 page 173 "Optimize Energy Performance" states
"Demonstrate a percentage improvement in the proposed building performance
-- " and  "For the purpose of this analysis, process energy is considered to
include, but is not limited to, office and general miscellaneous equipment,
computers, elevators & escalators, kitchen cooking & refrigeration, laundry
washing & drying --- "

On page 174 "For EA Credit 1, process loads shall be identical for both the
baseline building performance and the proposed building performance"

Assuming the same space process load is used in the baseline and proposed,
then a building with a receptacle load density of say 1.0 w/sf will produce
a much greater percent savings compared to the same building with a
receptacle load density of say 6 w/sf.

Page 173 "must comply with the mandatory provisions (Sections --- ) in
Standard 90.1-2004 (without amendments)"  There is no mention of Standards
62 for ventilation & occupancy density or Standard 55 for indoor comfort
conditions.  Does this mean that the baseline can be based on the proposed
ventilation, occupancy density and indoor comfort conditions?  According to
Standard 62-2004 the occupancy density for general office space is 200 sf/P
(from 142 sf/P in 62-2001 and I think 100 sf/P earlier).  This produces a
low percent system outdoor air and energy conservation measures such as
"occupancy based ventilation" and "outdoor air to relief air heat recovery"
have little effect.  Std 62-2004 (also Std 90.1-2004 for lighting) provides
design criteria for a limited number of space types such as a prison cell
(improved from 50 sf/P & 20 cfm/P in 62-2001 to 40 sf/P & 10 cfm/P in
62-2004) .  This makes it difficult to determine baselin e conditions using
Std 62.

I am looking at a financial institution building with high occupancy and
receptacle load densities.

Varkie, I can see merits for the 2.1 method and the 2.2 method.  On the one
hand, the process loads are to some degree out of our control.  But on the
other hand, if you have a building with such massive load density why would
the rating system want to exclude all of that energy from sustainable
practices?

 

I like the idea of consistency when considering all of the energy for energy
optimization, on-site renewables and green power - there are projects out
there that might earn fewer EAC1 points under v2.2 than under 2.1.  The
percentage savings were changed between the versions so it's hard to say if
it is more or less likely to earn a certain amount of EAC1 points - I would
be interested to see a summary if the data is available about EAC1 points
under v2.1 compared to v2.2.  Probably about the same?

 

For a high load density building like yours - definitely going to be harder.
The only suggestion as far as EAC1 points that I could offer would that if
your design has receptacle load at 6 W/ft2 there is probably a significant
diversity in that load, maybe it won't turn out as badly as you fear.

 

In regard to ventilation, you are going to use the outside air requirements
from the proposed design and apply that outside air quantity to both models.
There isn't a "baseline ventilation rate" - use equal CFM of OA for both
models.  Also, OA may be determined from local building codes rather than
ASHRAE - that would also apply equally to both models.

 

The one exception would be that Demand Control Ventilation could potentially
be used in the proposed model to reduce OA if DCV isn't required
prescriptively, and if your minimum OA from code is less than what is
required by ASHRAE 62.

Hope this helps!

 

David

Maybe I am naive, and I have not read the NC 2.2 reference guide yet,
but process loads would affect an internally load dominated building,
ie, my cooling loads would be different hence my equipment selection
between a low density office vs a "financial trading floor" type
situation. LEED and gaming the system aside, from a real design point
they are important, and could affect envelope component selection.

Vaibhav: Your reference makes the situation worse.    

The LEED energy savings rating system using the bottom line percent
savings over baseline appears to penalize buildings with high process
loads when you also consider LEED-NC Version 2.2 EA Credit 1 page 174
"The default process energy cost is 25% of the total energy cost for the
baseline building".  

What has the process energy cost (or the process energy use) got to do
with building design related to energy efficiency
(architecture-envelope, lighting, HVAC, DHW) except power supply for the
process?  The process energy within an office building can vary from 0.5
w/sf  (minimal use of computers and office equipment) to more than 6.0
w/sf for a financial/trading (Wall Street) type of building.  If the
baseline process energy is limited to 25% percent of total and the
proposed process energy use is more than 60% of the total then does this
mean that the building design is energy inefficient and does not qualify
for LEED certification?

Process energy could be part of the analysis if there is a baseline
standard for various types of computer and office equipment (varies
considerably and hard to define and prescribe for the numerous types
processes that occur in just office buildings) and the equivalent
proposed equipment is more efficient.  This comes under "Exceptional
Calculation Method" category along with several other energy efficient
building design options such as double-wall buildings for which you get
1 point (I think).

According to LEED-NC Version 2.2 EA Credit 1 page 174 "process energy is
considered to include, but is not limited to, office & general
miscellaneous equipment, computers, elevators & escalators, kitchen
cooking & refrigeration, laundry washing & drying, lighting exempt from
lighting power allowance (e.g. lighting integral to medical equipment)
and other (e.g. waterfall pumps).  Do all submissions for LEED
certification include all this.  At the construction documents
submission stage, what is the level of modeling detail that is required
regarding floor spaces and zones and all the systems, plant and
equipment shown on the drawings and specifications.  Can you use eQUEST,
select the type of building, and let the "Wizard" do the zoning and
assume most of the baseline data?   I don't think we are all playing the
same game, on the same level playing field and using the same rules to
show percent energy savings for LEED certification.

I also have some reservations about how various energy saving systems
are modeled with different computer programs.  The programs should be
studied and compared with the same case studies of different types of
buildings with different systems and plants and showing how each program
should be used to demonstrate energy savings from different energy
conservation measures such as UFAD.  

Building operation data can now be viewed on the web, collected for
meaurement & verification (M&V) and can be used to check computer
modeling results.  In the case of a M&V project at IIT, the web based
control systems show mainly temperatures.  Sub-meters and data loggers
should be included in the control specifications so that the performance
of the major systems, plant & equipment can be monitored separately and
compared with computer results.  At the moment we are comparing the
building utility meter reading with the bottom line building energy use
calculated by the computer program. 

Process loads do not affect energy code and Std-90 compliance since
"percentages" are not involved.

However I wanted to point out that for a LEED energy analysis, process
energy has to be maintained at 25% of total energy cost of the Baseline
Building Performance ( LEED- 2.2 Ref Guide page 182). I prefer taking
exceptional calculatins for process energy to simplify the calculations
as well as the review.

Hope this helps.

	Varkie,
	
	 
	Something we have been noticing in schools lately is a high
receptacle load, which we believe is attributable to increased usage of
computers, approaching and in some areas exceeding 5 W per square foot
-- the kinds of loads I used to figure for "technology intensive" office
areas just a few years ago.
	 
	In researching an energy question for a school today, I came
across this web page and case study which I thought was relevant to your
question:
	 
	
http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=power_mgt.pr_power_management
	 
	
http://www.energystar.gov/ia/products/power_mgt/North_Thurston_Case_Stud
y.pdf
<http://www.energystar.gov/ia/products/power_mgt/North_Thurston_Case_Stu
dy.pdf> 
	 
	Essentially they summarize how, by consistently implementing
power management on computer monitors and CPUs using a simple utility
program, a cost savings of an estimated $15-$30 per computer per year
can be realized (on personal workstations I would add, not systems
required to be continuously online).  Multiplied across thousands of
computers, the bottom line annual savings can be substantial.
	 
	How to account for this in energy modeling software I have a
general idea:
	 
	1) Assign the baseline receptacle load to "occupied hours"; e.g.
5 W/SF 'always on'
	2) Assign a diversified receptacle load schedule to the
alternate analyses
	 
	But quantifying the diversified load schedule is the hard part
-- it will no doubt vary significantly depending on the occupancy.
Though not fully developed, this may provide a starting point for one
method to reduce process electrical loads in a LEED analysis.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200703061058.AA5827562pd80001382736@gard.com>

Hello All,

I hope these questions are allowed to be addressed in this group:

 

If a building does not have heating and cooling system but has mechanically
ventilation system, is it still considered a natural ventilated building as
the section 5.1 of Standard 62 suggests?

Does this building need to follow section 6 of the standard 62?

How about its compliance with EQ c5, does it need to have MERV 13 air
filters?

 

Any information is greatly appreciated.

Thanks

Dear all,

When I select "Office Building, two-story" and put in my data. In the LS-C 
report, it shows that the wall is only affected but the roof is not affected 
whatsoever. With or without thermal insulation. Roof conduction is zero 
with/out the insulation. Using, schematic design wizard.

I have run the same case in a number of different climatic locations, same 
effect still. I have also run the default case when choosing "Office 
Building", but still same result.

Any help is much appreciated.

Micha

This is kind of an easy answer, but here is what the eQuest help file says for how they calculate the perimeter floor insulation:
 

Ground Floor - Exterior/Cavity Insulation


Usage Notes:

LBNL and CEC published sources describe approximations for using DOE-2 to model the two-dimensional slab-edge loss effects for a total of twenty-two perimeter insulation configurations. Each of these are represented under Exterior/Cavity Insulation when the Ground Floor Exposure is "Earth Contact".

Other insulation options are available when the Ground Floor Exposure is not "Earth Contact". These options represent a wide variety of insulating techniques dependent on the selected Ground Floor Construction type.

Changing the Ground Floor Construction will cause this input to reset to the default for the new Ground Floor Construction. 

DOE-2 Notes: 

For earth contact constructions, Perimeter Floor Insulation material selected here, if any, is represented in DOE-2 as a fictitious layer of insulation, placed below the floor slab, whose R-value is calculated to yield a composite total floor area UA product equal to a modified F2*perimeter length product, determined by LBNL research using detailed two-dimensional finite difference simulations. 

For all other floor constructions, the Exterior/Cavity Insulation material selected here, if any, is written to the exterior wall Layers command. Batt insulations are treated as R-value materials. For furred applications, no distinction is made between batt and board insulation, i.e., only insulation R-values are listed. In either case, only an R-value is written to the DOE-2 file, adjusted for thermal bridging effects. Thermal bridging is assumed in all cases for exterior wall Exterior/Cavity Insulation, since each is assumed to be applied between wall framing or furring members.

Hello,

I had a question regarding setting up a baseline model based on the ASHRAE 90.1-2004 standard.

Apply caution here, because F-values are conductance per lineal foot and
not per square foot.  They are meant to apply to slab perimeters and not
floor slab areas.  You would incur significant errors if you multiply
F-values by areas.  C-values are basically the same as U-values, but
without outside surface conductance coefficients (like air films).

Varkie,
 
Something we have been noticing in schools lately is a high receptacle
load, which we believe is attributable to increased usage of computers,
approaching and in some areas exceeding 5 W per square foot -- the kinds
of loads I used to figure for "technology intensive" office areas just a
few years ago.
 
In researching an energy question for a school today, I came across this
web page and case study which I thought was relevant to your question:
 
http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=power_mgt.pr_power_management
 
http://www.energystar.gov/ia/products/power_mgt/North_Thurston_Case_Stud
y.pdf
<http://www.energystar.gov/ia/products/power_mgt/North_Thurston_Case_Stu
dy.pdf> 
 
Essentially they summarize how, by consistently implementing power
management on computer monitors and CPUs using a simple utility program,
a cost savings of an estimated $15-$30 per computer per year can be
realized (on personal workstations I would add, not systems required to
be continuously online).  Multiplied across thousands of computers, the
bottom line annual savings can be substantial.
 
How to account for this in energy modeling software I have a general
idea:
 
1) Assign the baseline receptacle load to "occupied hours"; e.g. 5 W/SF
'always on'
2) Assign a diversified receptacle load schedule to the alternate
analyses
 
But quantifying the diversified load schedule is the hard part -- it
will no doubt vary significantly depending on the occupancy.  Though not
fully developed, this may provide a starting point for one method to
reduce process electrical loads in a LEED analysis.

Assuming the same space process load is used in the baseline and

will produce a much greater percent savings compared to the same
building with a receptacle load density of say 6 w/sf.

Page 173 "must comply with the mandatory provisions (Sections --- ) in
Standard 90.1-2004 (without amendments)"  There is no mention of
Standards 62 for ventilation & occupancy density or Standard 55 for
indoor comfort conditions.  Does this mean that the baseline can be
based on the proposed ventilation, occupancy density and indoor comfort
conditions?  According to Standard 62-2004 the occupancy density for
general office space is 200 sf/P (from 142 sf/P in 62-2001 and I think
100 sf/P earlier).  This produces a low percent system outdoor air and
energy conservation measures such as "occupancy based ventilation" and
"outdoor air to relief air heat recovery" have little effect.  Std
62-2004 (also Std 90.1-2004 for lighting) provides design criteria for a
limited number of space types such as a prison cell (improved from 50
sf/P & 20 cfm/P in 62-2001 to 40 sf/P & 10 cfm/P in 62-2004) .  This
makes it difficult to determine baselin e conditions using Std 62.

I am looking at a financial institution building with high occupancy and
receptacle load densities.

Varkie, I can see merits for the 2.1 method and the 2.2 method.  On the
one hand, the process loads are to some degree out of our control.  But
on the other hand, if you have a building with such massive load density
why would the rating system want to exclude all of that energy from
sustainable practices?
 
I like the idea of consistency when considering all of the energy for
energy optimization, on-site renewables and green power - there are
projects out there that might earn fewer EAC1 points under v2.2 than
under 2.1.  The percentage savings were changed between the versions so
it's hard to say if it is more or less likely to earn a certain amount
of EAC1 points - I would be interested to see a summary if the data is
available about EAC1 points under v2.1 compared to v2.2.  Probably about
the same?
 
For a high load density building like yours - definitely going to be
harder.  The only suggestion as far as EAC1 points that I could offer
would that if your design has receptacle load at 6 W/ft2 there is
probably a significant diversity in that load, maybe it won't turn out
as badly as you fear.
 
In regard to ventilation, you are going to use the outside air
requirements from the proposed design and apply that outside air
quantity to both models.  There isn't a "baseline ventilation rate" -
use equal CFM of OA for both models.  Also, OA may be determined from
local building codes rather than ASHRAE - that would also apply equally
to both models.
 
The one exception would be that Demand Control Ventilation could
potentially be used in the proposed model to reduce OA if DCV isn't
required prescriptively, and if your minimum OA from code is less than
what is required by ASHRAE 62.

Hope this helps!
 
David

To all,
   
  In February was posted in eQuest download area one document named e-Quest3-61, D224e4.zip.
   
  Know somebody for what is this? What this doing?

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200703041644.AA4414984pd80001381484@gard.com>

All,
 
For a particular simulation, I would like to change the ground source
heat pump cooling EER & heating COP to FEMP's 'Best Available' of 25.8
and 4.9 respectively, at standard conditions.  
 
May I avoid tampering with response curves and very simply just change
the cooling/heating electric input ratios as follows:
 
 
EIRc = 1/(25.8/3.412) = 0.1322
EIRh = 1/4.9 = 0.2041
 
 
Or is this too simplistic?  Ah Sundays, perfect for the quiet
introspective contemplation of energy studies...
 
Thanks

Thanks Jim (and all),
 
Upon closer inspection I see an 'HX Power' input on the 'Heat Recovery
2' tab, which I'm presuming to be parasitic interlocked to HX operation.
Will try plugging the runaround pump horsepower into this box, analyze
the numbers and report back with the complete 'How to Simulate a
Runaround Circuit' post.

In a ideal situation, the model would have a separate input for auxilary
power for ERVs, which some components of eQUEST (e.g., chillers) have
that option.  However, with the ERV, I would perform a hand calc to
include all of the power that the ERV consumes including your pumps and
divide that by the CFM.  There is an input for kW/CFM for ERVs.  This is
the same methodology I've used for Ind/Dir Evap cooling to consider
cooling tower fan and pumping energy.  For systems like these, I think
it's a good idea to calculate the kW/CFM representing the components of
your specific system.  Sometimes, the defaults are not respresentative
of your actual system.
 
Hope that helps,
Jim

How about a parasitic load that are tied to the operation of a system --
in other words loads that don't operate directly on the basis of a
schedule.  Specifically I have heat recovery pumps that need to turn on
only when the ERV is operational, and turn off when it ERV is on
standby, or of course off.

Lynn,
 
I'm assuming by external loads that you mean parking lot lighting, for
example?  If so, you would model this as a direct load to the electrical
meter.  This is set up by creating a schedule, double clicking on the
electric meter, entering the energy use, and then applying the schedule.

There was a "cookbook" in addition to the other manuals for Trace 600
(all hard copies), but CDS no longer appears to support Trace 600 (the
last DOS version of Trace). I've not been able to locate online
documentation at this point. If you can import the file into Trace 700,
you can simulate VSD CT's very easily in the cooling plant section.

Hello Everyone,

 

I am evaluating a project that was simulated in Trane TRACE 600.  I am
trying to model a variable speed cooling tower.  I see an option for a
2-speed tower but that is it.  I can also increase the number of cells
but that does not capture the VFD savings.

 

Does anyone have a technique to model a VFD cooling tower in TRACE 600?
Is there a user's guide or engineering manual available anywhere?

 

Thanks,

Are we all missing the point?
 
Converting 2.1E files to 2.2 does NOT necessarily mean converting
VisualDOE to eQuest. I understand the inputs for BOTH programs need to
be in a certain hierarchal order, not true for "raw" 2.1E or 2.2
 
Can one guarantee this 2.1 to 2.2 conversion will be automatically read
by the front end software?

In the past, I've calculated what the equivalent full load hours are for these types of loads. Then I can calculate the annual kWh, and average it out over the entire year to provide an adjusted connected kW load factor tied to an always on schedule.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] External Loads


I need to model external loads in eQuest and see in the tutorial and the
end-use splits that they are accounted for, but I can't seem to find
anything that addresses how they are entered. I'm sure it's obvious to
those who know, but it's a mystery to me. Guidance please?
 
Thanks.

Sterling Planet has rolled out a White Tag program and are claiming:
 
 "Sterling Planet has built technology to establish acurate (greater
than 99.9%) scalable and cost-effective processes for the measurement
and verification and certification of White Tag Certificates".
 
I'm no expert but greater than 99.9% accuracy in M&V of energy
efficiency projects seems....ummm...unlikely.  Can anyone offer some
insight into their claims?

	Hi,

	Sorry if this question may have already been covered in the
past, but I was wondering if there is a straightforward way to convert
Visual DOE files to run in eQuest, or at the least to grab the building
geometry out of the Visual DOE input file and have it translate into
eQuest.  A brief look at the Visual DOE input file indicated that it was
based on DOE 2.1E and not 2.2.

There is a document on the doe2.2 site that gives the steps for changing
2.1 inp to 2.2 inp. I had done it once before and it worked - also it
was less time consuming then redoing the whole thing again in 2.2.

My understanding of Appn. G is that, the zones and Thermal Blocks of the
Proposed and the Baseline should be identical.  As for which type of
system to be used as the Baseline, sometimes is tricky.  Principlly, it
depends on the heating energy source, Fossil Fuel or Electricity, which
is subject to interpretation when you use GSHP.

for an official response to cover your liability, you can send a request
for interpretation of ashrae 90.1 to steve ferguson
SFerguson at ashrae.org.  Unfortunately because 90.1 is a consensus
document, there is a formal process and all responses need to be voted
on.  Informally, you can get a quicker response from Jason and Gard who
i presume is reading this right now.

Thanks for the previous feedback...
 
A general question on the (eQuest) Baseline and Proposed that I wasn't
able to clarifiy in Appendix G:
 
When you have a complete system for the propsed building-multiple zones,
same level, each serve by GSHP-is the baseline to model the same zones
with the baseline mechanical system in each, say PSZ-AC?  Or is it
appropriate to model with a single system serving all the zones in each
case model?
 
In this regard, has anyone found in their pursuits of energy modeling a
resource to cover such general questions as this?
 
Thanks Again,
caleb

Check 90.1-2004, Table 11.3.1, No. 7 which discusses
HVAC zones.  "Where HVAC zones are defined on HVAC
design drawings, each HVAC zone shall be modeled as a
separate thermal block."  There are some exceptions
listed after this statement.  

Appendix G should be looked at in terms of enhancing
Section 11 rather than a stand-alone document.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200703020315.AA1523390pd80001380311@gard.com>

Hi Folks,

I am simulating a complex that contains two separate chilled/hot water system, one served by chillers and boilers and the other by heat pumps. The simulation run terminates with the error msg. "Loop: HP Loop has a coil curve generating a negative capacity ratio.  Check the loop supply temperature,  140.F, for consistency with the coil curves". 

The HP loop is defined as a 2-pipe type and the loop operation is set as snap (also tried "demand" but gave the same error). All heating and cooling coils have the default curves. When I deleted some airside system under the HP loop,  the error may go away but in the .sim file the HP loop heating load seems to be a little bit lower.

I am wondering if I miss something significant in setting up the heat pump system, since I never saw such a error before. Any advice will be highly appreciated.

Best,
Glenn

Alex:
 
You have it. VisualDOE was the first attempt I know (predating PowerDOE)
to make DOE-2 Windows based. Visual DOE is based on DOE-2.1E
 
eQuest is DOE-2.2, which combined SYSTEM and PLANT in HVAC. The eQuest
manual explains how to convert 2.1E files to 2.2. But realizes that both
eQuest and VisualDOE have their own hierarchy where exactly to place
inputs in the .INP file, irrespective if they can fly in 2.2 by
themselves in another line of the program.
 
So I think it becomes brain surgery to translate the files from one to
another. It would be faster just to reinput the data in eQuest.
 
In my humble opinion..

for an official response to cover your liability, you can send a request
for interpretation of ashrae 90.1 to steve ferguson
SFerguson at ashrae.org.  Unfortunately because 90.1 is a consensus
document, there is a formal process and all responses need to be voted
on.  Informally, you can get a quicker response from Jason and Gard who
i presume is reading this right now.

Thanks for the previous feedback...
 
A general question on the (eQuest) Baseline and Proposed that I wasn't
able to clarifiy in Appendix G:
 
When you have a complete system for the propsed building-multiple zones,
same level, each serve by GSHP-is the baseline to model the same zones
with the baseline mechanical system in each, say PSZ-AC?  Or is it
appropriate to model with a single system serving all the zones in each
case model?
 
In this regard, has anyone found in their pursuits of energy modeling a
resource to cover such general questions as this?
 
Thanks Again,

Zoning will always be the same in both buildings.  Each zone will be
served by either a single zone system or a central system depending on
the mapping.
 
Use the system mapping in Table G.3.1.1A and B.  The baseline system is
determined based on residential or non-residential, size (if
non-residential) and the fuel source for the proposed design.
 
The mapping may be giving you a lot of (inefficient?) single zone units,
App G is designed to give you credit for using a more efficient overall
system in that case.  If you meet one of the size thresholds, then you
will take your existing zones and serve them from a central VAV system
of some type, even though you have smaller distributed systems in your
proposed design.
 
If you haven't picked up the standard's user manual yet, that would be a
good acquisition.  Otherwise I don't know of much - Google does a great
job of searching through bldg-sim history.  Include "bldg-sim" in your
search, or use the search function off of Gard's page.

Below is a response from the Green Guide program manager about using
EQuest.  Please contact her for more detail if you need it.

The Green Guide recommends using DOE-2.1E or Energy Plus to calculate
compliance with GGHC EA Prerequisite 2 and GGHC EA credit 1.  However,
teams may use other programs such as eQUEST if they comply with the
performance standards laid out in the credit language.

For answers to additional questions, the Green Guide encourages
registered projects to post their queries to the Green Guide Forum.

Thanks!

Hello All, 

I was reviewing the new Green Guide for Health Care (GGHC) 
version 2.2, and noticed that the rules reference using 
either DOE-2.1E or Energy Plus for EA prerequesite 2 and EA 
credit 1. Does this mean that the GGHC will not allow the 
use of eQUEST? I assume that they would accept eQUEST, but 
I'd like to find out if anyone else has encountered this 
issue, prior to moving forward.  

Any clarity would be extremely helpful.

Thanks,

Mitch

Caleb:
 
If I understand your question correctly, I believe Appendix G requires
same zoning and HVAC system type, AIR-SIDE wise. In other words, if you
have 5 fans, all VAV, serving 15 zones (one fan to three zones), that
should remain the same, Proposed to Baseline.
 
But the WATER SIDE aspect may change.  I have had to start with a
Package VAV in the Base case, where the Proposed case is a CHW VAV.
 
Hope that answers your query.

Select "utility & economics" from the toolbar. Open the meter you want to assign the load to, and select the direct loads tab. You can input the load, tie it to a schedule, and pick the end-use category that it should be assigned to.

Lynn,
 
I'm assuming by external loads that you mean parking lot lighting, for
example?  If so, you would model this as a direct load to the electrical
meter.  This is set up by creating a schedule, double clicking on the
electric meter, entering the energy use, and then applying the schedule.
 
Hope that helps
Jim

If you mean exterior lighting or water feature pumps - something along

object as a "direct load".

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200703011205.AA0550750pd80001379495@gard.com>

I need to model external loads in eQuest and see in the tutorial and the
end-use splits that they are accounted for, but I can't seem to find
anything that addresses how they are entered. I'm sure it's obvious to
those who know, but it's a mystery to me. Guidance please?
 
Thanks.

Does anyone know the timeline for the tax credit - If I did a retrofit in
late '06, is it too late to apply for the tax deduction?

Best,
Andy

------------------------------------------------

Hello All, 

I was reviewing the new Green Guide for Health Care (GGHC) 
version 2.2, and noticed that the rules reference using 
either DOE-2.1E or Energy Plus for EA prerequesite 2 and EA 
credit 1. Does this mean that the GGHC will not allow the 
use of eQUEST? I assume that they would accept eQUEST, but 
I'd like to find out if anyone else has encountered this 
issue, prior to moving forward.  

Any clarity would be extremely helpful.

Thanks,

Mitch
