Hi, 
       
      I am trying to to get hourly heating load reports, similar to the  LS reports found in doe2.1e.  I have tried the hourly user defined  reports, however these only report sensible heating loads, and i am  interested in the total heating load. Any suggestions would be  appreciated.
  
       
      thanks in advance

Several things

First, ASHRAE Inverse Model Toolkit was created to do just that. There are
two ASHRAE Tech papers that describe it and its use (1050RP). Copies of the
IMT can be obtained from ASHRAE by contacting Mike Vaughn. 

Second, there are a wealth of reports and papers on-line at the ESL's
website that describe the modeling used in the Texas LoanSTAR program.
Third, there are several commercial packages that have IMT embedded in them.

Has anyone done this before? And if so, can this be accomplished in excel,
or some other software application? Thank you in advance for any help.

Here are easy ways to get hourly or non-hourly data from the .sim file
into an excel spreadsheet quickly without any "programming"

If you want to put eQUEST simulation hourly results into excel
(not non-hourly results output, but output of report-blocks
and hourly-report commands) then (from the detailed data edit
mode) go to the "Project & Site" module Component Tree,
in the Simulation Output folder and Non-Hourly Reports
subfolder, right click on the Loads Report or Systems Reports
item and open its properties sheet and sheet tab (the one(s)
for which you have created report-blocks and hourly-reports)
and change the "Hourly Data Save Format" to "Formatted"

This will cause a fixed field width formatted text file with 
no headers or pagination to be created in the project subdirectory
with a name for the project run with "_HourlyDataN_M" appended
to the end and an extension of ".DAT"  Example:
    Project 1 - Baseline Design_HourlyData2_01.DAT
The N is either 1 (loads reports) or 2 (HVAC - systems - reports)
and the M is the parametric run number.  You can then use the
excel import wizard (selecting open for "all files") to directly
import this text file as row/column data.

If you want to put eQUEST simulation non-hourly results into excel
you can open the .sim file in the D2SimViewer (you can do this from
outside eQUEST by simply starting the D2SimViewer and open the
output file of interest)  You can then navigate to a report you want to
move into excel, highlight the lines of the report you want to copy,
select edit/copy (or ctrl-c) then select the cell in an excel spreadsheet
where you want the data and do a edit/paste-special and passte as
text, then (after the text is first pasted into excel and the format selection
icon appears at the bottom of the pasted text) select the option to
"use text import wizard" and allow the wizard to match rows/columns in
the text to be corresponding rows/columns in the spreadsheet.

In order to efficiently retreive and analyse the results in the SIM file 
you need to develop some text extracting tools - I use C++ and Perl.
If you want to understand the layout of the SIM file better, get a powerful 
text editor that can read the entire SIM file quickly.  I use UltraEdit 
http://www.ultraedit.com.
For the weather file information you can quickly generate the hourly 
weather data using the weather tools that come with Equest.

EZSim is a low cost spreadsheet simulation model that produces a

Degree days are not appropriate since balance temperature is rarely 65 deg.

Good question! This is a difficult problem at the whole-building level.

 

Dr. Kris Subbarao at NREL did some parameter estimation work on this in the 1980s (i.e., BEVA, PSTAR), as did Dr. Robert Sonderegger in the early 1980s at Princeton. 

 

There may also be some useful work by Spitler et al. at Oklahoma State University on measurement of convection coefficients in calibrated chambers.

 

There was also a useful paper by Agami Reddy in 1988 in the Thermal Envelopes conference that compared different parameter estimation methods. Finally, I believe that Larry Palmiter (Ecotope) has also done some work in this area.

Dear M. Haberl:

 

RP-827 is about in-situ measurement for blowers, pumps and chillers. Is there any RP or report for in-situ parameter estimation (like U-value or thermal inertia) to analyze building envelope thermal performance?

 

Thank you in advance.

	I'd be careful with using simple HDD/CDD analysis as this can lead to errors that are larger than what you're trying to measure. Energy use in commercial buildings is usually not well described by HDD/CDD, especially if one is looking at comparing different building types. EPA's Portfolio Manager provides an general index for comparison. However, if you are trying to discover why a building is more/less consumptive that another, you'll need a stronger tool.
	 
	ASHRAE has outlined many of these procedures in Guideline 14-2002. Also, ASHRAE has developed the Inverse Model Toolkit (IMT), that will perform linear, change-point linear, variable-based degree day and combined multiple linear regression. The IMT can be had for $30 from ASHRAE, and includes the FORTRAN source code to encourage folks to embed this into their own tools. Several ASHRAE Transactions paper are available on this as well. 
	 
	Demand modeling is not as simple. However, ASHRAE has provided some help in this area as well with their RP-1093 Diversity Factor Toolkit. Additional toolkits from ASHRAE include RP-1004 for thermal storage, RP-827 for in-situ measurements, RP-1092 for AHU performance measurement, and RP-1051 for calibrated simulations. All have ASHRAE Transactions papers describing the projects, and reports available from ASHRAE. ASHRAE has also recently released a Scoping Study, available on their website, that outlines a new effort to develop procedures for measuring the performance of a building, including energy, IEQ and water.
	 
	The IPMVP also provides good advice on this matter, which are based in part on Guideline 14-2002. You can download their reports from their website www.bmvp.org. <http://www.bmvp.org> 
	 
	I think you'll find these very valuable.

	You might also look into some of the EPA Energy Star tools.
	
	See: http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=tools_resources.bus_energy_management_tools_resources
	
	 
	
	Also see the EPA portfolio manager at: http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=evaluate_performance.bus_portfoliomanager
	
	 
	
	You can use Portfolio Manager on existing buildings.  Enter the energy bills and some other data and your buildings will be compared to a national database of similar buildings in similar climates and you will receive a "score."  Your score is what percentile an individual building is in when compared to its peers.  A score of 75 or higher can get you an Energy Star building rating.
	
	 
	
	For new buildings or building designs, look at Target Finder at: http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=new_bldg_design.bus_target_finder
	
	 
	
	It's a similar service that can "normalize" building energy performance through a scoring method.

Mike:
 
I'd be careful with using simple HDD/CDD analysis as this can lead to errors that are larger than what you're trying to measure. Energy use in commercial buildings is usually not well described by HDD/CDD, especially if one is looking at comparing different building types. EPA's Portfolio Manager provides an general index for comparison. However, if you are trying to discover why a building is more/less consumptive that another, you'll need a stronger tool.
 
ASHRAE has outlined many of these procedures in Guideline 14-2002. Also, ASHRAE has developed the Inverse Model Toolkit (IMT), that will perform linear, change-point linear, variable-based degree day and combined multiple linear regression. The IMT can be had for $30 from ASHRAE, and includes the FORTRAN source code to encourage folks to embed this into their own tools. Several ASHRAE Transactions paper are available on this as well. 
 
Demand modeling is not as simple. However, ASHRAE has provided some help in this area as well with their RP-1093 Diversity Factor Toolkit. Additional toolkits from ASHRAE include RP-1004 for thermal storage, RP-827 for in-situ measurements, RP-1092 for AHU performance measurement, and RP-1051 for calibrated simulations. All have ASHRAE Transactions papers describing the projects, and reports available from ASHRAE. ASHRAE has also recently released a Scoping Study, available on their website, that outlines a new effort to develop procedures for measuring the performance of a building, including energy, IEQ and water.
 
The IPMVP also provides good advice on this matter, which are based in part on Guideline 14-2002. You can download their reports from their website www.bmvp.org. <http://www.bmvp.org> 
 
I think you'll find these very valuable.

You might also look into some of the EPA Energy Star tools.

See: http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=tools_resources.bus_energy_management_tools_resources

 

Also see the EPA portfolio manager at: http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=evaluate_performance.bus_portfoliomanager

 

You can use Portfolio Manager on existing buildings.  Enter the energy bills and some other data and your buildings will be compared to a national database of similar buildings in similar climates and you will receive a "score."  Your score is what percentile an individual building is in when compared to its peers.  A score of 75 or higher can get you an Energy Star building rating.

 

For new buildings or building designs, look at Target Finder at: http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=new_bldg_design.bus_target_finder

 

It's a similar service that can "normalize" building energy performance through a scoring method.

The simplist way to compare a collection of energy consumption from different climates is to normalize using Heating or Cooling Degree Days.  This can be done in excel and you can get HDD/CDD data from any number of sources online.

The other way to do it is to use bin data (with
somthing like binmaker pro) for the various climates
in questions and analyze heating, cooling and
dehumidification over a targeted temperature and
enthalpy setpoint, seperately. This will take into
account for the effects of dehumidification as well as
suppose to only temperature using HDD and CDD.

Mike,

 

My response does not suggest a software package, but I will suggest that the
most meaningful climatic classifications would be to follow the climate
zones in ASHRAE Standard 90.1.  There are 8 zones, but when the sub-classes
of "moist (A)", "dry (B)", and "maritime (C)" zones are included, there are
17 zones, and they represent the entire world - no just the U.S.  This would
not seem to be an impractical number to deal with and it also matches the
IECC climate zones.  Possibly you could pick a city that is approximately
centrally located in each zone.  It turns out that zone 1B (very hot-dry)
does not exist in the U.S., but you could use Riyadh or some other hot-arid
city in a foreign country.  I believe all the other zones are represented by
U.S. cities.

If the energy consumption is weather-dependent, you could categorize the
collected data in terms of CDD and HDD ranges for different locations
(ASHRAE Standard 90.1), although this won't be quite accurate, since it
neglects the effect of humidity.

Mike and all,

Software called "Metrix" marketed by Abraxas Energy Consulting can do 
what you describe.  It costs about $3,000 per license, and has a steep 
learning curve.  You probably also have to subscribe to their weather 
data services.  Last time I used it I found it frustrating because it 
was still a 16-bit Windows program and couldn't handle long filenames, 
etc.  They have a 30 day free trial version.

copyright law; weather data, by its very nature, is not an "original work of authorship",
so the underlying data cannot be a subject of copyright ... a work incorporating the
weather data can be a copyrighted work, but the weather data portion (which was
not an orginal work of authorship) cannot be protected by such a copyright.  Thus
the FORMAT of a data base is protected by copyright, but the data is not protected
by copyright.

On the other hand, I guess God could file a copyright on weather data by claiming
authorship ... perhaps our President could ask about this possibility during one of
his future conversations ... then, perhaps, DOE could hold the copyright for the
weather creator.

*Excuse for cross posting* 

 

Dear all,

 

I am pleased to announce the extended deadline for the special session titled "LOW ENERGY BUILDINGS". The session will be organized at the IASTED International Conference on POWER, ENERGY, AND APPLICATIONS (PEA 2006) in September 11-13, 2006 in Gaborone, Botswana: http://www.iasted.com/conferences/2006/Botswana/pea-specsess3.htm. We invite researchers, faculty, students, and members of industry and government agencies to participate in this important session. We would highly appreciate if this participation is active by submitting research papers and case studies. After this session, we would organize a round table with topic "ENERGY POLICIES FOR  LOW-ENERGY BUILDINGS".  Papers are due April 15, 2006 and should be send to prof. Milorad Bojic by Email on: bojic at kg.ac.yu.

Please, kindly forward this message to your friends, colleagues and any other interested contacts and please do not hesitate to contact me for any inquiries you might have.

 

I would take the opportunity to recall another special session titled "Energy and Systems Simulation in Buildings for Hot Climates" of a simultaneous conference (IASTED MSO 2006)  http://www.iasted.org/conferences/2006/botswana/mso-specsess2.htm  organized by Prof. Harry Boyer.

Dear All

Have you ever simulate ASHRAE 90.1 Budge building? The HVAC system type for
the budget building design shall be determined form Figure 11.4.3 in ASHRAE
90.1. I am now simulating a two-pipe fan coil system with air source heat
pump chiller. Can you give me some suggestion :

1)  Whether the condenser cooling source should be Air or Water

2) Whether the heating system classification should be Electric Res, heat
pump or Fossil Fuel

Yours
Nicole Chen

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200603141930.AA3000984pd80001019900@gard.com>

I have modeled thermal ice storage in eQuest before, but I've never
figured out how to add it in the eQuest interface.  I've always added
the BDL code in the input file, then opened the input file with eQuest
to create a project file.  I feel like there must be an easier way to
add thermal storage - any solutions?

Thank you!

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] modeling different fuel types

Hi, 
 
I am trying to model a building which uses an oil fired steam boiler for heating the building and a packaged DX/gas rooftop unit for certain areas in the building.  In DOE2.1e i can only model either natural gas or fuel oil as energy resources for the heating.  is there a way to model all three fuel sources or is DOE2.1e limited to having only 2 types of energy resources?
 
thanks in advance

Chris,
   Yes, my apologies for that - I thought by "open source," you meant 
software whose source code was included in the license (open for the user) 
- not that the software itself was free.
Mea culpa
   David

Charlie,

You may find the DesignBuilder interface to EnergyPlus useful for your
educational/practice work because it makes the process of energy modelling
and visualisation relatively quick to learn and apply on real projects, but
provides the accuracy of the EnergyPlus simulation engine.  DesignBuilder is
not open source, but prices are reasonable with educational discounts
available.  You can use DesignBuilder to run any version of EnergyPlus,
including tailored versions which may be engineered by more technically able
students.

You can find out more about DesignBuilder from:

  Hello all...
  I am working on a technology grant for the Ecosa Institute, a budding
ecological design school in Prescott, AZ, attracting student from all design
disciplines.  Our practice-based educational model engages students in real
projects with real clients.  The projects range from single-family homes to
large institutional buildings.  Keeping up with the latest technology is a
challenging task for our non-profit and I am exploring the most effective
ways to do so.  I am looking into applying for a technology grant to fund
products that will support the use of open source programs for graphic
design, architectural drafting, site/building systems/energy modeling, etc.
If anyone knows the availability of such programs, favorites, suggestions,
please let me know.  I am currently exploring EnergyPlus and its interface
possibilities.  Thank you.

I don't see any mention of open source on those sites.  It looks like it 
costs $2,100 USD for the base version?

I'm modeling some very large buildings and receiving the following cautions:

Area
-CAUTION--- VALUE GREATER THAN MAXIMUM OF    0.1000E+06

Volume
-CAUTION--- VALUE GREATER THAN MAXIMUM OF    0.1000E+07

The models appear to be simulating correctly but I need to be sure that
these cautions are not affecting my results. Has anyone verified that these
cautions do not affect simulation results?

Thanks,

J. Campbell

Hello all,

This is more of a general question I am asking for the benefit of a paper I
am researching. 

I am searching for any documentation or discussions on the benefits of using
event driven simulation over uniform time increment modellers. Can anyone
point me in the right direction and give some specific popular examples of
uniform time increment simulations modellers?

Kind regards

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200603080916.AA1609453pd80001012540@gard.com>

Hi, 
   
  I am trying to model a building which uses an oil fired steam boiler for heating the building and a packaged DX/gas rooftop unit for certain areas in the building.  In DOE2.1e i can only model either natural gas or fuel oil as energy resources for the heating.  is there a way to model all three fuel sources or is DOE2.1e limited to having only 2 types of energy resources?
   
  thanks in advance

Brian,
Wind is a less costly technology to expand grid generation capacity in many locations.  I'm curious how much renewable energy is created, and how much carbon/nuclear generation capacity avoided, by placing renewables on houses (i.e., scaling down to capacity of a residence).  Consider the amount of renewable energy created, and conventional capacity avoided, if one invested the, say, $20,000 or so (for a rooftop-scale system), in a company that develops renewable energy to compete head-to-head with conventional generating capacity addition.   
An interesting comparison of generating capacity addition, by technology, accounting for the health and environmental cost of power production:  www.tellus.org  search for publication "Coal . . . "
Opportunities to displace conventional generating capacity addition with renewable energy, based on renewable energy applied at the most promising locations and where a capacity addition choice is present, perhaps merit our attention (and enthusiasm!) more than the 'net zero' house.

  To me, Net Zero is a very powerful term, and there are some important strict definitions and also a lot of support for interpreting the term on a project by project basis.  Net zero takes us out of achieving some percent of energy reduction in to the realm of true sustainability.  Net Zero has been applied primarily to homes, but would be a potent tool for commercial and institutional buildings as well. At the strictest level Net Zero energy refers to a building that generates annually on-site from on-site available renewable sources enough energy to equal the annual building energy usage.  This goal is a subset of the goal that buildings meet all of their energy needs from renewable sources in some way.  To me the Net Zero concept provides several benefits.

  Several people provided the link to a good summary article from BuildingGreen.com, in the October 2005 edition, that covers four NREL definitions related to Net Zero  http://www.buildinggreen.com/articles/  (Need to subscribe on line to download article) The first of these is the strictest version noted above.

  3)  Add other renewables with off-site fuel supply to 2), such as bio-mass, wood and wood pellets, bio-diesel, ideally with combined heat and power
  4)  Purchased renewables
   
  Achieving 1 and 2 for commercial buildings above a story or two in an urban setting is going to be very difficult, because the area available for PV compared to square footage of the building is so small.

  There may be value in preserving ???Net Zero Energy???to refer strictly to 1) and 2), with on-site solar and wind only.  The concept is so powerful and useful in marketing and pushing the ideas with the people who will pay for it and design to it, that I think we need to find a way to use the terms more broadly.  As some pointed out, this is already being done with Zero Energy Homes, that may actually be 60% from renewables not 100%.  I plan to use the term ???Nearly Net Zero???, or perhaps ???Net Zero with PV and Off-site Wood???, and define if this is Nearly Net Zero for a. Energy, b. Source Energy, c. Energy Cost, and/or d. Emissions.  It may be reasonable or possible to assign a number description to this to help make comparisons.  For example, the project I am working on is getting to Nearly Net Zero Energy using conservation, PV, and a wood pellet CHP unit.
   
  Conservation (below ASHRAE 90.1 or other baseline):                70%

We are looking for three to four speakers for a 90 minute seminar to be held
at the ASHRAE meeting in Dallas. Please, see below for the seminar abstract
and deadlines. For questions, please feel free to contact Prof. Jean Lebrun
and Michael Wetter.


Abstract


 

This seminar shall show how simulation packages that are built using
equation-based solvers can benefit the building energy community. Such
software packages typically separate the formulation of a model's underlying
physics from its numerical solution algorithms. This allows input-output
free modeling, which facilitates model reuse and the selection of the
numerical solution algorithm that is best suited for the problem at hand.
Equation-based simulation packages are frequently used in various industrial
sectors. In building energy simulation, however, they have not yet enjoyed
wide-spread use. Based on a technology assessment and case-studies, this
seminar shall stimulate discussions to understand their applicability,
advantages and limitations for the building energy community.

 


Deadlines


May 1, 2006: Submission of 100-200 word abstract to WetterM at utrc.utc.com

June 1, 2006: Notification of acceptance.

I am trying to model condenser water LOAD-RESET (WB-RESET) with a WATER
ECONOMIZER CHILLER and a CENTRIFUGAL CHILLER. For some reason, the
centrifugal chiller is never running at all though I don't have any
LOAD-MANAGEMENT for this run. My EQUIPMENT-CTRL sequencing is set to
operate the water economizer chiller, followed by the centrifugal
chiller. It works fine though with a FIXED control setpoint on the
condenser water loop. Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.

 

Thank you,

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200603060559.AA5903250pd80001009932@gard.com>

Dear all

I try to simulate a air cool heat pump system for two-pipe FC in Equest.
when I changed the chiller type to "heat pump", the default performance
curve for heat pump will be set in Equest. Most of the name of the curves
are begin with "chlrHPAirheat",only that for EIRf(PLR) is
"RecipAir-EIR-fPLR-4Comp/Ckt". I doubt this EIRf(PLR) curve maybe is
suitable for air cooling reciprocating chiller. Can it be used for air
cooled heat pump? Has any of you simulation the same system and used
performance curves other than default ones? If there is any, would you
please send me some air-cooled heat pump ( screw) curves?

Thanks for all the many great replies to my query on Net Zero, and use of
bio-mass CHP in addition to PV and wind in this context.

To me, Net Zero is a very powerful term, and there are some important strict

reduction in to the realm of true sustainability.  Net Zero has been applied

refers to a building that generates annually on-site from on-site available
renewable sources enough energy to equal the annual building energy usage.
This goal is a subset of the goal that buildings meet all of their energy
needs from renewable sources in some way.  To me the Net Zero concept
provides several benefits.

Benchmark for measuring achievement of a very aggressive energy design
A target that can shape any design and orient design towards a truly
sustainable energy endpoint
A "sexy" marketing tool/concept to really help promote a step up from LEED
and other energy % reduction targets (which are great, but not enough)

Several people provided the link to a good summary article from
BuildingGreen.com, in the October 2005 edition, that covers four NREL
definitions related to Net Zero  http://www.buildinggreen.com/articles/
(Need to subscribe on line to download article) The first of these is the
strictest version noted above.

Zero-net annual site-energy
Zero-net annual source energy
Zero-net annual energy cost
Zero-net annual emissions

Another resource is a NAHB study on a net zero home model, which also
provides these definitions, and other useful references, and is available
for free.

Another way to consider this is in terms of what type of renewables are in

Pedro,

If your coils are based on a 20 deg F delta T with 180 deg F fluid
supply temperatures ( variable flow constant temp) you will need valves
with inverse characteristics to the fan/coil (i.e. Logrithmic (eq%) or
modified splits)... constant flow variable temp systems tend to behave
more linear...i.e. 50 flow delivers 50% output.

Hi all:
We?re modelling a building with a number of
water-to-air fancoils in each thermal zone.
We have yet built the coils without problems.
However we are not sure about the valves that control
water flow rate. We think that processes such us
histeresis, uncertainties in actuator position or

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] About thermostatic valves in zone equipment
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200603030400.AA0032546pd80001007224@gard.com>

In a previous life, I was involved in the modeling of thermostatic radiator valves.  By this I mean self actuating valves using either a fluid phase change or wax capsule to operate the valve.  If this is what you mean, then it depends if you want to be able to model control instabilities due to the long time constants involved.  If this is not a concern, then I suggest you model as a proportional controller with very wide proportional band - say 5K or so.

We were a commercial company, so nothing was published on this topic, but if you want more detail, I might be able to help you.

Hi all:
We?re modelling a building with a number of
water-to-air fancoils in each thermal zone.
We have yet built the coils without problems.
However we are not sure about the valves that control
water flow rate. We think that processes such us
histeresis, uncertainties in actuator position or
relation between position and water flow should be
taken into account.
We have lacks of references and documentation about
this.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200603030110.AA1044187pd80001007044@gard.com>

Nicole,
The command for converting bin file to text file is MKAFT. This is a
batch file that uses the BIN2TXT.exe executable to convert a .bin file
in the weather directory to a text file.
Below is an excerpt from the DOE2 weather utilities readme file - 
 
MKAFT.BAT  Batch file to create a text file from a binary file using
BIN2TXT
              useage:  MKAFT filename
              filename is DOE-2 binary (filename.bin) in WEATHER (no
extension)
              filename.ft is placed in WEATHER directory

Assuming your bin file name is example.bin, type " MKAFT example" to
create example.ft file in the weather directory.
You may also need to edit the MKAFT.Bat file to set the path to your DOE
weather directory, weather.bin and weather.fmt files.
 
Hope this helps,

Mate,

Another resource is the California DEER database that lists costs for
various energy efficient building components.  Some of the entries are a
bit confusing, but the database does have information on the incremental
cost of high performance glass per square foot.

Dear all,

    I am trying to find out about construction, material and cleaning
costs of different curtain wall systems. The cost information will be
used in my study on techno-economic optimization of smart double-skin
facade systems. I would appreciate if anyone can help me obtain the
information. It is impossible for me to get the information from glazer
or cost estimating companies because they require a construction
contract. I only need to know average costs of different products
(single/double clear glazing, single/double low-e glazing).
I do not need to know brands of the products. If anyone can help me,
please contact me at mate.thitisawat at arch.gatech.edu or (404)451-0153.

Dear all,

I really hope someone would have a solution. After stimulate a baseline
design, I have problems with the "Enduse" reporting format. All the end
user reports has a legend box without any graphic/table/result. The
"monthly Electric Peak Day Load Profiles" report does have a reasonable
energy use profile that break down into different building system. FYI,
there is no BDL error. I have an electricity and fuel meter setup. 

So, in short, I need to know why the energy consumption does not break
down into individual building systems. 

Thanks in advance!

Yury
