Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200301280259.AA5958125pd80000247913@gard.com>

We will hold an HVAC implementers workshop at LBNL February 4-5, 2003
(Tuesday-Wednesday next week).  The workshop will start at 8:00 PST and
last six hours each day.  Each day the event will be videocast live to
the LBNL office in Washington, DC.

The workshop will start with a general IFC model overview the first day
(architecture, concepts, reasons) and will then go into technical
detail.  It will cover the following topics:
1. Available tool-sets and utilities for working with the model (model
servers, EXPRESS tools, etc.)
2. The most useful repositories of source code and documentation
3. Available avenues for obtaining support while working with the model
(such as ISG and MSG)
4. Contact points for previous modelers and implementers
5. Overview of the certification process.

If you plan to attend at either location but have not already confirmed
you attendance, please do so ASAP by notifying either myself
(v_bazjanac at lbl.gov) or Rob Hitchcock (rjhitchcock at lbl.gov).  We need an
accurate head count by the end of this week so we can have passes and
parking ready on time.

If you cannot come to the live sessions but would still like to
participate via telephone link and NetMeeting, please let us know ASAP. 
We will have a limited number of phone links available on the
first-come-first-serve basis.

     Developers of ?ENERGY-10? for Architects Select GeoPraxis' Green
Building XML Schema for New Data Structure




            Open Source Schema Gaining Momentum with Green Building Software
Developers


             (IW)(CA-GEOPRAXIS) San Francisco, Calif., January 26, 2002
/ --GeoPraxis, Inc. announced today that the National Renewable Energy
Laboratory, developers of the award-winning design tool for architects,
ENERGY-10, are planning to base future development on the open source Green
Building XML (gbXML) schema originally developed by GeoPraxis.

            A PC-based building energy simulation tool, ENERGY-10 helps
architects and building designers quickly identify the most cost-effective,
energy-saving design alternatives for commercial and residential buildings
up to 10,000 sq. ft. Energy-10 is specifically designed to help evaluate
energy-efficient green building features in the very early stages of the
design process.

            Douglas Balcomb, Research Fellow at the National Renewable
Energy Lab, said, ?After reviewing the various data structure options that
are available for representing both building geometry and energy-related
characteristics, we have decided that gbXML is the best near-term approach
to bridge between several simulation options and new multi-zone capabilities
under development for the Energy-10 building energy analysis package."

            The gbXML schema was developed by GeoPraxis to facilitate the
transfer of building information stored in CAD models that is essential to
designing resource efficient buildings. XML, extensible markup language, is
a type of computer language that allows software programs to share
information with little or no human interaction.

            John Kennedy, President of GeoPraxis, said, ?NREL?s decision
confirms that gbXML is an ideal method for storing all the data, including
3D geometry, required to build a highly accurate energy simulation model.
This vote of confidence signals to our commercial software partners that our
simple, market-oriented approach also satisfies the needs of a recognized
leader in the energy simulation research community.?

Dear all,

as starters with Energy Plus we currently experience problems controlling a
single zone model correctly. Our aim is to maintain a certain temperature an
humidity range for the space. It was no problem to set up devices such as  (
in order)

Mixer
Fan
Cooling coil ( dehumidifier, controlled by hum ratio )
Cooling coil 
Humidifier 
Heating coil
Zone

Now we are busy trying the system to work as we want. Temp range 17-18degC
						        rel Hum range 45
-60%

Could whoever has an example system file make it available for me to see
where we went in the wrong direction? Furthermore it would be helpful to
look at a control scheme (picture) since it is very hard for me to get my
head around all the nodes.
I think we just need to be sure want parameter we control where and how to
define it.

Many thanks for your effort in advance

Kind Regards

Christian

To the Bldg-Sim Community:

I had a friend in graduate school who took at job at Hanford.  A couple of years later she was back - her new born son had just been operated on for testicular cancer.  Unfortunately we cannot say whether it was just bad luck or it was from exposure to radiation at Hanford.  

Please fully educate yourself and your students to the risks associated radiation exposure before working at nuclear facilities.  An excellent book on understanding the science behind this is Dr. John Goffman's  "Radiation and Human Health" published by the Sierra Club.  

Nonetheless we need people who are willing to protect the public from the toxins in our environment.  Ideally the people in this position have the needed information so that they are not put in harms way and can truely protect the health of people in neighboring communities.

Sincerely,

Jon McHugh

A million years ago, my father was the energy guru for Hilton Hotels,
Holiday Inn, Sheraton, as well as on the Executive Engineer's Committee of
the Amaerican Hotel/Motel Association. I personally have modeled at least 50
major hotels throughout the country, many on DOE-2.

But I need to check my sources as they are at LEAST 10 years old. Clarify
more of what you want. Energy savings are more readily avaiable that costs,

Christian,

You should be able to use EnergyPlus to accomplish this.  You need to use
the Low Temp Radiant System:Hydronic in conjuction with a Construction With
Internal Source.  The example files include several idfs using this system,
such as RadLoTempHydrCtrlOpt.idf.  For help with the input, refer to the
Input-Output reference.  The Engineering Reference includes an extensive
explanation of this model.

Dear Christian,

IDA Indoor Climate and Energy (www.equa.se/ice) has a component for floor
heating that is straightforward to use. IDA is used by Tarmac in the UK for
modeling TermoDeck buildings, i.e. ventilated hollow core slabs. Slab
cooling in the present version requires a bit more effort since the user has
to connect pipes and controllers at the advanced level interface.

Let me know if you want any further details on this.

Dear all,

I am looking into the modelling of underfloor heating/ cooling systems and
the response of the space to the system and the external climate.
Since the system will be used for both applications I need to size the
system based on cooling. Can I use Energy Plus to determine the pipe centres
(density of pipes necessary to achieve the output required) or do I need to
consider different packages such as TRNSYS?

If somebody reading this "cry for help" has examples or even tutorials on
that particular subject (Energy Plus) please let me know!

Many thanks for your effort in advance!

Regards

VisualDOE 3.1 can import geometry data (polygons) from DXF files. The
DXF files have to be in AutoCAD version up to 13.

eQuest does not import geometry data directly from DWG files, it shows
the DWG drawing as the background and you can trace those
points/vertices to create zones.

Is it possible to attend this seminar without a laptop computer?  How much
time will be spent on the workshops using the laptop?  Does the seminar
room have receptacles for up to 30 laptops or do we have to have enough
battery power for two days?  Is the emphasis of this course on the IDF or
Text editor?  How much time will be spent on graphics I/O (VoloView, DXF)?
 

My main interest is learning about the engineering scope and alternative
combinations of plant and systems and to find out if the program is ready
to replace DOE2.1E in our office.  The building projects in this office
vary in size from 0.5 to over 2 million square feet. The projects can
consist of multiple buildings with central and distributed plants and
systems for ofice complexes, hotels, college campuses, convention centers,
airports, research labs, hospitals, etc.  Graphical input using AutoCAD is
not practical for such projects since there can be over 100
two-dimensional architectural drawings and the drawings are subject to
frequent revisions.  Is it presently realistic to use EnergyPlus to
describe 20 or more systems with ductwork, piping and equipment?  Can
systems and plant in EnergyPlus be also described the conventional way as
in DOE2.1E?  DOE2.1E presently does not permit duplicate systems using the
LIKE-EXCEPT keywords and this is awkward in desribing floor by floor
systems in a high-rise building.

Attached is a generic building model that I am in the process of
developing for teaching graduate students at IIT-Chicago.  It is based
approximately on one of our previous projects but modified so as to
demonstrate the various types of spaces, zones, systems and plants.  I
will be creating DOE2.1E and TRACE-700 models (input data) of this
building.  I would like to have an EnergyPlus input file (text/BDL) so
that I can use it to study EnergyPlus.  Perhaps Bldg-Sim subscribers would
be interested in developing such examples.  The attached example is still
in a preliminary scrappy phase.  The best EnergyPlus training would be to
have EnergyPlus input files of several buildings that used DOE2.1E.

Introduction to EnergyPlus for Experienced Modelers    

January 29-31, 2003, Chicago, Illinois, USA    

Come to this EnergyPlus training course immediately following the 
Chicago ASHRAE meeting in January.  The course schedule is:  

Wednesday, January 29, 2:00 to 6:00 pm  
Thursday, January 30, 8:30 am to 5:30 pm
Friday, January 31, 8:30 am to 1:00 pm     

This workshop will introduce EnergyPlus to experienced modelers who 
are familiar with the basic concepts of energy simulation.  The 
course will cover the mechanics of using EnergyPlus with an emphasis on
aspects of EnergyPlus that differ substantially from other common modeling
tools (e.g., DOE-2 and BLAST), such as the use of a multiple time-step
approach, the integrated simulation of loads, systems and plant, and
defining fluid and air loops.  Bring your own laptop for the hands-on
workshop sessions.    

The course will be held in "the loop" in Chicago at the Crowne Plaza
Silversmith, 10 South Wabash Avenue (1 block north of the Palmer House
Hilton which is the ASHRAE headquarters hotel).    

For more details on the course outline, registration fees, and 
accomodations please see

Approximately 25% to 30% of the time will be spend on workshops.  
Without a laptop, you won't be able to do the workshop problems which 
would severely limit the effectiveness of the course.

There will be power to each table.

For the workshops, the IDF editor will be recommended to avoid 
problems with typos, but participants will be free to use a text 
editor if desired.

> How much time will be spent on graphics I/O (VoloView, DXF)?  

Very little.  The dxf output files with the free VoloView express 
viewer are a good way to view the building.

The focus of this training course is to introduce users to the 
mechanics and fundamentals of using EnergyPlus.  In 2 days, it will 
only be possible to scratch the surface on basic HVAC system 
descriptions.  Your question would be better answered by reviewing 
the Input/Output Reference.

Graphical input of the building geometry is only an option, not a 
requirement.  The current input tools available for EnergyPlus are 
the IDF Editor and raw text file editing.  Some users have described 
complex buildings using these tools.  Is this approach realistic 
within an A/E design environment?  Maybe, maybe not.  For similar 
repetitive systems, copy/paste/replace can be quite efficient once 
you get used to the input language.  The only way to really answer 
this is to invest some time in learning the tool, preparing the input 
for some smaller problems, and then evaluating if it will meet your 
needs.

EnergyPlus has a limited set of templates to help describe some 
common system configurations, and further development of this 
approach is planned.  There is no LIKE feature in EnergyPlus.

Hello Group...

I'm in the process of putting together a thermal active cooling simulation
model to be used in residential buildings. I need to run it against extreme
hot weather data. the problem is this.

*-I have weather data spanning 10 years for a given location.

*-I need to determine the hottest month or week that will produce the
largest cooling load.

What criteria should I look for as the load is based not only on dry bulb
temp but also humidity and solar.

Is there any sort of CoolingLoad factor algorithm that takes all of these
into account when sizing cooling systems? Is there a common weighting
factor
used?

CoolingLoadFactor(SolarGains, DryBulbTemp, Humidity,... ?) = ?

I''l need a criteria to create a program to parse the weather data
to get my extreme week/month.

Thanks for your help

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Variable Speed Exhaust
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200301031532.AA3241750pd80000236660@gard.com>

Hello:

Can't help but jump in when someone refers to me as a "lofty scholar".
Actually, my lab office is in the basement (chamber of doom?).

 

Not a bad answer from John Aulbach. I agree that Jeff Hirsh would be the one
to answer questions about PowerDOE. I'm also a 

"barefoot" DOE-2 user who writes his own BDL. Obviously, at some point your
going to need to dig into the manual and see what 

each fan in your system is and how that compares to what you want. I'm not
sure what PowerDOE does.

It is my understanding that DOE-2 can be used to simulate "demand"
ventilation, by specifying the CFM/PERSON, which is really

acting like a perfect CO2 controller. The fans and the amount of ventilation
would need to be described by the user. Most likely,

looking at some of the hourly outputs for a given day would be helpful in
your case.

Jeff

I'm trying to simulate a variable speed exhaust fan of the type manufactured
by Melink.  Supposedly, the exhaust will turn on as required based on room
temperature and on smoke/CO2 levels. I was thinking to maybe model just a
CO2 demand control ventilation system using a minimum outside air schedule.
I appreciate your help. I'm still learning PowerDOE, and learning it on my
own. Do you know of any colleges that might do distance learning for
simulation programs of this type? Again, thanks for any help.

Sincerely,

JP Carioto

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Variable Speed Exhaust



Got an idea, but it needs further research. I run DOE-2.1E, and PoweDOE is
2.2, but everything in my version carries forward in intent and philosophy
into 2.2.

Chose a SYSTEM (or whatever PowerDOE calls a SYSTEM) that is a VAV system
that allows a RETURN-AIR fan. Make that SYSTEM 100% outside air. Therefore
both SUPPLY and RETURN FANS are variable flow, and the RETURN FAN
essentially becomes an EXHAUST or RELIEF fan.

You then need to tell the fans what controls their speed, which could be
temperature, or a schedule for usage (occupied/unoccupied, etc). If your
kitchen SUPPLY fan actually exists, it will have a variable flow over its
coils. If all air is entrained into the space (NO SUPPLY FAN), simply set
the KW/CFM to zero and any coils it contains to ZERO btu capacity to negate
any energy usage from a SUPPLY FAN.

By the way, I believe PowerDOE will give you, in the raw DOE2 reports, all
fans individually by SYSTEM consumption. The RETURN FAN will be your EXHAUST
FAN.

I believe this will give you a variable speed exhaust. I would like my
colleagues in DOE2 cyberspace to confirm my suspicions. Jeff Hirsch, Jeff
Haberl, and other lofty scholars, do you think this will give this gentleman
his answer?

Hi all: 
  I'm trying to model a variable speed exhaust fan in a kitchen for a large
hotel in PowerDOE.  I'm not sure how to go about it.  If anyone could give
me some ideas, or if anyone has done this before, I would appreciate it.
Thank you.

Hello:

Good question.

The old "solair" calculation used to account for
solar and temperature. Perhaps an "solenthalpy" index
might work. Also, don't forget that heat builds up over 
a several day period, so you might want to add thermal mass
to the expression. This would, of course, depend upon
the amount of ventilation, and/or solar exposure that
the building has, therefore it is building-specific. For
buildings with ground-coupling, this comes into the expression
as well.

We are looking at similar issues to determine the peak
day for NOx reductions from electricity use in buildings 
in Texas. In our work we have a "standard" building that 
represents various chapters of the 2000 IECC, which is
then run against the weather tape.

Hello Group...

I'm in the process of putting together a thermal active cooling simulation
model to be used in residential buildings. I need to run it against extreme
hot weather data. the problem is this.

*-I have weather data spanning 10 years for a given location.

*-I need to determine the hottest month or week that will produce the
largest cooling load.

What criteria should I look for as the load is based not only on dry bulb
temp but also humidity and solar.

Is there any sort of CoolingLoad factor algorithm that takes all of these
into account when sizing cooling systems? Is there a common weighting factor
used?

CoolingLoadFactor(SolarGains, DryBulbTemp, Humidity,... ?) = ?

I''l need a criteria to create a program to parse the weather data
to get my extreme week/month.

Thanks for your help

Phyl
