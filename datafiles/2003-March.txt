Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Help me publicize BLDG-SIM
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200303051240.AA4046796pd80000266671@gard.com>

It has been a while (a few years) since I publicized the 
BLDG-SIM mailing list. My goal is to make it a resource for 
everyone who may have a question about building energy 
simulation.  Unfortunately, only 530 people currently 
subscribe to BLDG-SIM and yet over 50,000 use building 
energy simulation programs worldwide (sum of vendor 
reported values on www.energytools.gov under whole building 
analysis - energy simulation).

I would like to put together a "press release" e-mail to 
send out to different mailing lists, publications, and 
forums. If necessary, I would seek permission from the list 
administrator so that it does not appear to be spam.

I would like your help, please e-mail me (jglazer at gard.com) 
the names and/or websites for any mailing lists, 
newsletters or forums that are building related or building 
energy related. 

I will put together a summary of all the suggestions and 
post it.

Thanks,

Jason

EnergyPlus is the U.S. Department of Energy's new generation building 
energy simulation program. EnergyPlus includes many innovative 
simulation capabilities including time steps of less than one hour 
and modular systems simulation modules that are integrated with a 
heat balance-based zone simulation.  With the many new features 
available in EnergyPlus, even those who have used other energy 
simulation software will benefit from this.

The following two EnergyPlus workshops have scheduled:

EnergyPlus Introductory Workshop for Beginning Modelers 
April 28 ? May 1, 2003

EnergyPlus Advanced Workshop 
June 3 ? June 4, 2003

Both workshops will be held at the Wingate Inn in Prospect Heights, 
Illinois (a northwest suburb of Chicago).

Nesen,

I want to call your attention to some work by Jurovics reported in the
ASHRAE Transactions the early 1980s.
Your proposed investigation sounds similar.

Hi Christoph,

I am not sure if you will get all the details you want
from this paper, but you may want to check it out for
some data on Singapore;

of Performance-based Simulation Tools for Building
Design and Evaluation ? a Singapore perspective.

Hi Nesen





Two approaches for your solution:





1. Parametric Runs of Energy Simulation


You can use Energy Simulation software to run the same file changing
parameters of your choice, hence it is called parametric runs. You can run
your input file parametrically using EnergyPlus. This can be big and time
consuming. And it is impossible to visualize such problems with more than 2
design and 1 response variables. Anyway, there are different ways you can
do it:


         a.      Using MS-DOS batch file


         b.      Using available interfaces


         c.      Design your own interface to existing simulation software





2. Use formal optimisation techniques


So far, it is more realistic way to deal with a number of variables. BUT
you have to be proficient enough on optimisation techniques and formulation
of the problem. Result can be tricky enough if you don't model your problem
properly. See Louisa Gama Caldas's paper on this: Caldas, L.G., Norford,
L.K. 2002. "A design optimization tooll based on a genetic algorithm"
Automation in Construction, Vol. 11, pp 173-184.





GenOpt by Michael Wetter can be of help. Go to:
http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/GO . You can use different types of
algorithms to optimise the fa?ade. GenOpt also claims to be able to do
parametric runs. One thing you need to remember, GenOpt is not only for
environmental design optimisation. It is rather generic ? you can couple
any ASCII file based simulation software. Its free but I am not sure of
other aspects. There are a lot of commercial optimisation software
available to suit your need. These algorithms are tested, robust and will
give you better results than "available free codees". Such a software may
be VisualDOC (http://www.vrand.com). To gain a comprehensive idea of
optimisation and its application try visiting NEOS server on optimisation.
ParamPlus claims to do parametric energy simulations. Check it.





I have done some coding to do parametric and optimisation runs. These are
still in alpha release and sorry that I cant share it right now. But if you
are stuck, don't hesitate to write.





Regards,





Monjur Mourshed

HI Vailbhav,

  I am not sure if I understood the question well. What is the error message
it displays? In Energy 10 you can define two wall types in the same
orientation either with % wall area (i.e. e.g. you can define 40% of wall of
one type and rest of another type) or you can add the walls in the main menu
under buildings_bldg1 or bldg2_walls and define any number and type of walls
in any orientation. If you have specific question regarding Energy10, you
may want to join the Forum at the following link. The moderator,Kristine
Chalifoux, is very prompt in answering the questions.

I hope it helps.

Arizona State University. I a working on Energy-10 version 1.6 .Energy -10
is giving me a problem regarding adding more than one wall type per
orientation for the same thermal zone. If any of you have had similar
problems can you please let me know how this problem was tackled.

With Regards,
Vaibhav Potnis
P.s - I am refering to the Mastering Energy -10 manual. But steps mentioned
in it have not helped me much.

A considerable effort has been made at implementing ground source heat pump models in EnergyPlus. The models currently include a water-to-water heat pump and ground loop heat exchanger. Other models, such as a pond heat exchanger, pavement heat exchanger and cooling towers are available for the modeling of hybrid systems. You can find some details on the development and implementation of these models by looking at the MSc thesis of one of our recent graduates:

I pretty sure the refrigeration component in 2.1e is for grocery
stores...but could be tricked 
into thinking it is an ice rink. I'm not current on 2.2.

Hey, Jeff. I haven't tried it, but doesn't 2.1E TNG (The Next Generation)
have a refrigeration component that might be expanded to an ice rink?

Also, eQuest Version 3.0 (DOE-2.2) claims to now have the direct ability to
do ice rinks via the refrigeration system link.

Hello: 

One can force DOE-2 into thinking there's a "cold" zone sandwiched in 
between two 
zones, with a bit of tinkering with UA's to counteract minimum zone temps. 

That's what we did in the following paper:

Center",  ASHRAE Transactions-Research, Volume 91, Part 2, pp.  1421 - 1433,

Hopefully, some better methods are now available elsewhere that model 
interior conditions, including radiation from the rink to surfaces inside 
the 
building...

I'm pretty sure the latest versions of DOE 2.2 include some kind of ice 
rink zone, w/ice rink brine CHW. Don't know if it's in Equest. I guess 
someone at SCE was excited by ice rinks or something.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200303271024.AA243378pd80000278567@gard.com>


To the ESP-r community:

Since switching to the GPL distribution and development approach for
ESP-r there have been a growing number of individuals and groups who
have downloaded the distribution and who are making use of it in their
work, businesses and classrooms. With this expanding user community
comes an increasing demand to evolve the system.

There is a existing development community who manage the half million
lines of code and dozens of example models. We want current and
potential developers to expand their skills and join in the discussions
about evolving ESP-r.

What we have in mind is to host a worldwide developers workshop and
conference for ESP-r. Basic workshop sessions might include topics such
as:

 * structure of the code distribution
 * the common code base (esrucom)
 * library functions (Fortran and C)
 * underlying data model and its expression in files and common blocks

There might also be advanced workshop sessions covering topics such
as:

 * thermophysical sub-systems and inter domain communication
 * advanced scripting
 * working with other software agents
 * data exchange with other software agents
 * porting issues
 * adding functionality and/or extending the data model
 * procedures for contributing to the 'archive'

The conference might include presentations by key developers,
discussions on where do we want to go and how we go about getting
there.

The workshop would be residential, and to save costs, we would probably
make use of University of Strathclyde accommodation and computing
facilities. Costs per person would be 300 Pounds plus accommodation
expenses. Of course, the Highlands of Scotland and the magnificent West
Coast is so easy to get to and we will be finding some ways for you to
get a taste of it.

So, we want to find out who would be interested in bringing their
laptops and ideas to Glasgow this summer. Please tick the boxes below
and email back to Jon Hand (jon at esru.strath.ac.uk) by the middle of 
April.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200303261352.AA5250906pd80000278051@gard.com>


Thank you for your replies everyone, I wanted to post back with the most
common suggestion, which was to use the California Climate Zone weather
file #4, which as it turns out is a weather tape from Sunnyvale...one of
the next towns over from Palo Alto, about halfway between PA and San
Jose.  I may perform runs for San Jose and SF to show the client the
effects of their location selection, however Sunnyvale appears to be the
most reasonable selection for the primary analysis.

An explanation of the climate zones can be found here:
http://www.energy.ca.gov/maps/climate_zone_map.html with a listing of
which actual location the weather file is from.

The weather files themselves are available from the DOE EnergyPlus
weather site or the DOE2.com weather download site.  (Among others?)

Thanks again for your suggestions!

David

        as demonstrated by a whole building simulation using the Energy
        Cost Budget Method described in Section 11 of the Standard.
In my quick check of the standard, the modeling software must be able to
model at least ten (10) thermal zones.  If we are going by the letter,
Energy-10 does not qualify because it can only model  two (2) zones.  The
DOE-2 website claims that the ASHRAE standard was based on DOE-2 analyses,
so it looks like DOE-2 is the winner. 

(I personally have not used Energy-10 or DOE-2.  I am working primarily with
EnergyPlus.)

I hope I have helped.

I am working on a project which had registered for LEED certification. Now
we have to make decision of the energy simulation tool we are going to use
to optimize energy performance.  Our choice is DOE-2 or Energy-10.  I am not
sure if Energy-10 is a qualified energy simulation program for LEED
certification and I appreciate if anyone could tell me more about it. 

Thank you for your help!

Does anyone have experience they'd be willing to share regarding SF Bay
Area weather files?

It would seem that Palo Alto might be closer to San Francisco (Downtown
or Airport) for heating, but the summer is more extreme.  However not as
extreme as that of San Jose.

If anyone has a weather file lying around, or an idea on how they've
tackled this problem, I would appreciate hearing about it.

Thanks!

My apology for cross-postings.

The Institute for Research in Construction (IRC) of the National Research
Council of Canada (NRC) has released a beta version of the skylight software
called SKYVISION for testing and evaluation by end-users.  The software can
now be downloaded free of charge from the web:
http://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ie/light/skyvision/.  The potential users of
software are skylight manufacturers, building designers, architects,
engineers, and fenestration councils.  Skylight manufacturers use the tool
to rate skylight products (existing or new products), and to provide
services to their clients on how to select the right skylight for the right
application.  Building designers/architects use the tool in all the design
phases (pre-design, design, retrofitting ) to maximize the energy benefits
of skylights by accounting for the skylight shape and glazing, geometry of
the indoor space (curb, well, room), position of skylights on a roof,
lighting and shading controls, site location and sky/ground conditions.
Fenestration councils use the tool to rate skylight products (visible
transmittance, solar heat gain coefficient, daylit coverage area, etc. ).


Your comments/suggestions, and bug reports are very useful and appreciated.
Feel free also to forward this email to whom may be interested in.

Should you need more info, do not hesitate to contact me.

FYI: this is the website I was looking at:
http://gundog.lbl.gov/dirsoft/d2whatis.html
It is the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory website for DOE-2.  If they
have the info wrong, it should be corrected.  Let's do our part to keep the

Just a quick correction and note.  I haven't seen the
DOE-2 web site, but the runs performed by PNNL in
support of what became ASHRAE 90.1-99 were done using
BLAST, not DOE-2.  The program requirements in 90.1's
ECB method were intended to aim the user in the
direction of a more robust hourly analysis rather than
a bin method or even spreadsheet based program.

The requirements for LEED 2.1 Energy and Atmosphere credit 1 state:
	Reduce design energy cost compared to the energy cost budget for
energy
	systems regulated by ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-1999 (without

In my quick check of the standard, the modeling software must be able to

Energy-10 does not qualify because it can only model  two (2) zones.  The
DOE-2 website claims that the ASHRAE standard was based on DOE-2 analyses,

Our choice is DOE-2 or Energy-10.  I am not sure if Energy-10 is a qualified energy simulation program for LEED certification and I appreciate if anyone could tell me more about it. 

Thank you for your help!

For your information, I have attached the DOE2.1E input file that tried to evaluate occupancy based ventilation.  The location is Indianapolis, the name of the project has been removed, and Washington utility rates were inserted.  Change the .doc extension to .inp.  I would like to discuss methods of using DOE2.1E for other energy savings with those who are interested.  Is there any interest in discussing ideas for designing and developing hvac, plumbing and fire protection engineering design software?

Mostly correct; item #3 below calculates minimum outside air at design conditions, and then uses this value all hours; it does not adjust hourly for the actual number of people.

We tried scheduling the outdoor air fraction in the Systems component of the DOE2.1E program by using the occupancy schedule in the Loads component.  This would vary the outdoor air based on occupancy using CO2 sensors in the Return Air.  However the schedule overrode the air-side economizer.  Can this problem be fixed in DOE2.1E?

Hello group

 

Does anyone out there have experience with simulating demand controlled ventilation in DOE2?  I am especially interested in any work that validates the use of such a model for estimating energy savings from this control scheme.  Any advice or information would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!

In DOE-2.2, the values in the MIN-AIR-SCH should not be a repeat of the occupancy schedule, but should instead be the product of the occupancy schedule times the normal minimum outside air ratio.  For example, consider a system designed for 25% outside air.  At 100% occupancy, the value in the MIN-AIR-SCH should be 1.0*0.25 = 0.25.  At 20% occupancy, the value should be 0.2*0.25 = 0.05  

This schedule does not override the economizer operation; it simply establishes the minimum outside air fraction.  

Note that, while a minimum outside air ratio of 0.05 may be sufficent to dilute CO2 at low occupancy levels, the building may have other internal sources of air pollution, such as carpet outgassing, that may require that the outdoor levels always be kept above some minimum.  This is particularly true when the building is new, or when the building has been rennovated.

I suggest you set up an hourly report looking at total supply airflow and the outside airflow to confirm the program is modeling as you intended.

  In order to vary the outdoor air with occupany (with CO2 sensors in the return air that controls the OA dampers), I repeated the occupancy schedule in the MIN-AIR-SCH also.  The energy use went up compared to the same input (which also specified airside economizer) that did not have MIN-AIR-SCH.  I assume the schedule was applied during the intermediate season also when it should be using 100% OA.  In this situation the OA must vary independently of the supply air which would be based on the cooling load in a VAV system

Did you just use the occupancy schedule in the
MIN-AIR-SCH? Or did you multiply it by your previous
minimum OA%? ie. if your previous min oa was 20%, the
new MIN-AIR-SCH would be a range of values from 0 to
0.20 that match the occupancy profile. Then the
economizer will allow more OA if needed. The CO2
control shouldn't call for more OA than the previous
minimum.

Of course, this would get more complicated in multiple
zone systems, where the CO2 control will override
critical zone calcs.

Hello,

There are three options for values in the min-air-sch.

1.  A fraction value (ex:  0.36) in any given hour sets the MINIMUM air as a
fraction of total system air flow for that hour.  The economizer is enabled
in this case  so the actual outside air could be greater than the minimum if
cooling is needed and outside conditions favor the use of the economizer.
NOTE:  Be careful, even if you set the minimum OA ratio in the system
screen, you should still use that same ratio in the schedule.  Using a value
of 1 will give 100% of the total system OA, not 100% of the minimum OA.

2.  A zero (0) value closes the outside air damper AND disables the
economizer.  This is usually used for optimum start periods.

3.  A Flag value (-999) asks DOE to calculate the minimum amount of outside
air needed based on the number of people in the occupancy schedule and the
OA cfm/person specified in the thermal zone.  The economizer is enabled in
this case so again the actual outside air could be greater than the minimum
if cooling is needed and outside conditions favor the use of the economizer.

For demand controlled ventilation, I've used an OA schedule flagged 24/7
(except during optimum start periods = 0).  For constant OA during occupied
periods and closed OA dampers when unoccupied, I use the minimum OA fraction
during occupied periods, "0" during optimum start, and Flag all unoccupied
hours to ensure economizer availability.

Hope this helps.

  We tried scheduling the outdoor air fraction in the Systems component of
the DOE2.1E program by using the occupancy schedule in the Loads component.
This would vary the outdoor air based on occupancy using CO2 sensors in the
Return Air.  However the schedule overrode the air-side economizer.  Can
this problem be fixed in DOE2.1E?

    Hello group



    Does anyone out there have experience with simulating demand controlled
ventilation in DOE2?  I am especially interested in any work that validates
the use of such a model for estimating energy savings from this control
scheme.  Any advice or information would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!

I have made runs using DOE-2.1E for a chilled water double duct system and a
Heating and Ventilating System. When I call up the SS-H report, both systems
show fan kWh, but neither show fan run hours in the accompanying scatter
plot. What gives?

In order to vary the outdoor air with occupany (with CO2 sensors in the return air that controls the OA dampers), I repeated the occupancy schedule in the MIN-AIR-SCH also.  The energy use went up compared to the same input (which also specified airside economizer) that did not have MIN-AIR-SCH.  I assume the schedule was applied during the intermediate season also when it should be using 100% OA.  In this situation the OA must vary independently of the supply air which would be based on the cooling load in a VAV system

If you're based in Winnipeg, when you talk about
government incentive programs you probably mean CBIP.
For CBIP you have to use EE4, which is their front end
for Doe2.1e. EE4 is really just intended for CBIP
compliance and isn't so useful for modelling. I
believe most people in Canada are sticking with 2.1e
because its the CBIP engine. At any rate, whatever
front end you use you really need to understand Doe-2
well to get valid results.

BLDG-SIM List Members,  

Please help me by testing the second public beta version of 
DoeRayMe, a screening tool application and parametric 
analysis tool using DOE-2.1e.  

DoeRayMe is a simple and flexible user interface for the 
building energy simulation program called DOE-2.1e. It is 
intended to be used as a user interface for many "screening 
tool" applications or for parametric studies.

To find out more about the beta test and download the beta 
software go to:  

  http://gard.com/DoeRayMe/  

The beta test period ends April 30.  All comments are 
welcome.

Thanks  

Jason

Hello all,

I have recently subscribed to the group.  I was hoping to get some feedback
from users for the various simulation programs available. Our firm is
looking at acquiring a suitable simulation program for modeling buildings
for LEED rating purposes as well as green building incentive programs.  We
had a trial version of TAS by EDSL in our office but we have nothing to
compare it to.  Is DOE-2 a straight-forward application with a reasonable
user-interface? Are there other programs that are user-friendly while
producing a comprehensive simulation?

Any assistance would be appreciated.

Stirling,

DOE-2 is a text based program that has had several user 
interfaces added to it. I know that people have used it for 
LEED certification. You can see who sells DOE-2 and the 
different interfaces at:

http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/dirsoft/d2vendors.html

To see a list of many different energy simulation tools, go 
to:

http://www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/tools_directory/

and look under "energy simulation" under "whole building 
analysis"

Hi,
I'm doing my thesis on wind towers in Iran, and I need weather files (in TMY2 
> format preferably, but others will do) for any or all of the following 
Iranian cities:
1. Yazd 
2. Isfahan 
3. Shiraz

I'd appreciate any help
  
Thanks

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Calibrated models
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200303130448.AA4832406pd80000270996@gard.com>

I am a portuguese HVAC designer and consultant and a user o DOE2.1-E for
over ten years. Usually I use DOE for new buildings, but five years ago
I participated in an Energy Audit of six buildings in Portugal and had
my first and only experience of DOE model calibration. I used the
folowing methodology (work done with the colaboration of an electricall
engineer):
 
1.Preparation of building inspections (average 2 days work).
    -study of building and systems drawings and specifications,
    -study of energy monthly bills,
    -conception and organization of forms to be filled in the building
      inspection work,
 
2.Building inspection (average 2 days work).
This included;
     -filling a form for each room in the building, in wich all the
relevant
       aspects where characterized (lighting, equipment, hvac equipment,
        people, schedules).
     -characterization of the HVAC systems installed
     -characterization of other energy consuming equipment installed
       (elevators, water and sewage pumps, exterior lighting, etc.)
     -interview with people responsible for building operations to
determine
      operating schedules and the way the building systems were operated
 
3.Field Measurements (average two weeks)
This included;
     -total building energy consumption during one week  registered with
a
      portable electricall energy analiser (output to a PC),
     -registration of energy consumption of speciall energy consumers
       (elevators, computer rooms, ?plugs and lighting? in office
floors, etc.)
     -measurement of power consumption of speciall equipments (water and
      sewage pumps, lighting, etc.)
     -measurement of main airflows and hvac effective working
conditions,
 
4.Creation of a DOE model (average 3 days)
This included;
      -model in a room by room basis
      -including all non HVAC consumers
 
5.Calibration (hourly) for a week day an weekend measured (average
1day).
This included;
      -use of a meteorological day (in the TRY, only available
meteorological data )
        similar to the meteorological conditions of the day in wich the
measurements
        where taken,
       -use of hourly energy use schedules for each zone of the building
        for all energy consumers
       -calibration against the actual hourly energy measured,
 
6.Verification of the calibrated model against existing monthly bills
(average 1day)
This included;
      -DOE calculation of monthly energy consumption using the
calibrated
        model and a TRY year (only available meteorological data)
      -comparation of calculated monthly consumptions and the actual
energy
        consumption of the existing bills for the last years.
 
 
This experience  showed the following;
 
I.The hourly calibration against a day of measured data allowed for a
close match of
not weather dependent energy consumer sectors (equipment, lighting,
escalators,
water and sewage pumps, etc.).
 
I I. The use of the hourly calibrated model for the monthly energy
calculations (using TRY) showed in all cases an acceptable match with
the existing bills.
 
I I I. The bigger energy consumers were lighting and equipment, wich are
not weather
dependent and easy to calibrate. HVAC acounted for around 20 to 25% of
the total building energy consumption.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] DOE2.1E oversized heating and cooling equipment?
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200303121829.AA2940312pd80000270794@gard.com>

The autosized heating capacity in DOE-2 is calculated based on following equation:
Heating Capacity (Btu/h) = 1.08 x Supply CFM x {(MAX-SUPPLY-T)-(DESIGN-HEAT-T)}

Supply cfm is determined from load runs to satisfy both the zone peaking heating and cooling load and is set equal to heating and cooling mode for CAV system.  So the heating capacity in Report SV-A is calculated before the system starts the hourly run.  If you input a high value for MAX-SUPPLY-T, you will get the oversized heating coil/furnace. The best way to avoid DOE-2 oversize equipment is to define the heating equipment capacity after running the Design Day.

Mark,

At the outset, I think the term "calibration" should be limited to a simple 
matching (within pre-approved tolerances) of the target data one may have 
to work with.  If the target data are monthly utility bills alone, then 
calibration is fairly simple, but will necessarily leave unanswered 
questions regarding the individual variables that were "tweaked" to achieve 
calibration.  I would leave control of those input variables within the 
context of modeling detail or quality rather than confuse the issue of 
calibration with them.

A more stringent calibration project may require matching of both monthly 
kWh and monthly peak demand kW (which may need to be converted to 
hourly).  In this case the calibration process will necessarily require 
more detail in the model just to achieve the required tolerances around the 
12 additional target points.  The more target data you have, the more 
demanding the calibration procedure will be, and the more exact the model 
will necessarily have to be.  The term "calibration" could still be limited 
to the context of matching any number of target data points within an 
acceptable set of tolerances.  Issues of modeling accuracy and detail 
maintain their inherent importance both with and without calibration.

In Reference to the recent `Weather Normalization Question' discussion line
which evolved into a discussion of calibration, and to many years of
discussions of calibrated modeling, I think perhaps we are lacking a
definition(s) of what a `calibrated' model is. There are many out there but
there are no standard definitions that I've ever seen, beyond `matching
utility bills within x %' that appears in some DSM program guidelines.  
I believe this must be done in the context of `What are we going to use the
model for?"  I've seen the term used in reference to everything from
aggregated load research work to the building on the corner that is
considering a HVAC upgrade, from the Texas A&M shoot-out predictive
statistical routines to detailed end-use monitoring and M&V approaches.
Often it is used to as a surrogate for `expensive' or for `high quality'. 
Questions that should be answered in a definition:
Calibrated to what standard measure? And why that particular standard?
The entire model or just pieces?
How closely does it have to match the defined standard? Possibly including
various statistical measures.

Regarding the weather normalization issue...
A relatively simple way to do rough weather normalization when all you have 
are DB temperatures coincident with the billing periods is to convert to 
CDD and HDD and perform linear regressions to derive coefficients that 
represent kWh per degree-day.  It usually works best to use heating-only 
months and cooling-only months independently for HDD and CDD, and ignore 
the swing months.

The degree-days may be defined to coincide monthly with the billing cycle 
or the billings may be converted to calendar months.  In the  first case 
you also need degree-days that represent calendar months to subtract from 
degree-days you get from the TMY weather year.  Then you multiply the 
monthly differences between TMY and your calendar degree-days (some 
differences will be negative) by the regression coefficients and add these 
to the actual calendarized monthly utility bill kWh.  Thus you get billing 
data that mimic what would have been billed on a calendar month cycle 
during a TMY weather year to calibrate your model against.

If you don't already have a good handle on the best CDD and HDD base 
temperatures, try 72 for CDD and 65 for HDD, and you will be close in most 
cases.  Caution: if you prefer to use degree-hours in lieu of actual 
degree-days, you should also use different base temperatures, typically a 
few degrees higher for CDH and a little lower for HDH.  If the heating 
system doesn't depend heavily on electric equipment that respond to outdoor 
temperature, attempts to derive an HDD coefficient might be futile or 
misleading (a negative coefficient is a dead giveaway), and it might be 
better to just live with the unadjusted monthly kWh for the heating 
season.  If you can get two or three years of billing history and 
coincident temperatures, you can use all to derive better regression 
coefficients, but you have to calculate the average (of these years) 
calendarized monthly degree-days to subtract from the TMY degree-days to 
normalize.

I love to calibrate DOE2 models, but it can get sticky if you are shooting 
for really close agreement on both monthly kWh and kW.  If that's your 
goal, your greatest needs will be "mo data" and "mo time", and, sigh!, the 
method above might not be the best start.

Happy calibration!

The US and Canadian weather services have both gone from manual to automated
observations (ASOS = Automated Surface Observing System or AWOS = Automated
Weather Observing System) starting in 1991, but most since 1997.  At this
point, I believe all stations have switched over to ASOS/AWOS.  The biggest
problem with the ASOS/AWOS data for building simulations is the lack of
observations from which solar irradiance can be estimated. There is reported
cloud cover, but this a laser observation that "sees" clouds only up to
12,000 feet.  Moreover, the correlation of this new data to the previous
manually observed cloud cover data on which almost all solar models have
been based is unknown.  Because of this problem, ASHRAE TC 4.2 (Weather
Information) initiated last year a research project to develop a method or
methods for estimating solar from either ASOS/AWOS data or from other
sources, such as satellite observations.  This project (1226-RP "Integration
of ASOS Weather Data into Building Energy Calculations with Emphasis on
Model-Derived Solar Radiation" )  is expected to be completed early next
year (2004).  Until then, people trying to do calibrated simulations using
actual year weather data will likely encounter a big data hole starting from
1997.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200303111834.AA341893pd80000270106@gard.com>

I am working on eQuest version 3. When I set up a parametric run to change 
the weather from Phoenix ,AZ to Seattle, WA in the detailed interface, the 
simulation results show are identical to the Phoenix results.
I have tried specifying the weather file in Project and Data section. I have 
also tried alternatively to input the latitude, longitude and altitude of 
Seattle in the Site parameters section. None of the two methods are working.
Is there any other procedure that I may try? Any help on the topic will be 
of great help
Thank you.

EZSim generates irradiation, humidity from ave temp. All on a monthly 
basis, of course, where the correlation is good. It wouldn't be possible on 
an hourly basis.

A moot point. If you have only 12 monthly points to match against, and you 
do match well, then higher time resolution simulation is unnecessary 
overkill. Why model to a level not supported by the metering data?
If it lines up nicely, as you say, then it is good for simulations at the 
monthly level.
Calibration is matching the bills, but I think you are saying that you want 
to be sure that you have correctly nailed the end uses as well. Quite so. 
That comes from matching across a range of seasons. If you match throughout 
the year, you have captured end uses pretty well. And that's based on 
observations of many pre/post models where we have billing data in both cases.

Regarding the first comment from Dave Robison, I've
received the weather data in WYEC2 format from
Environment Canada, including solar, wind, etc.
However, the last time I had to do this was for a 1999
weather year, and I understand that recent automation
of the weather stations may make this data harder
(impossible?) to come by. But without this data, how
are you making the calibration?

And although I've only calibrated a few of these, not
hundreds, I'm not sure I'd agree that the model
doesn't need to be detailed and it's a low cost
simulation. If you don't put a fair bit of work into
making sure the simulation of systems is reasonably
similar to the operation of them, then you're not
calibrating, you're just matching the bills. And while
your model might line up nicely with the bills, if
your end-uses or hourly profiles are off its not going
to be so useful for running further simulations on.

for the most part, I have been lurking on this group because, unlike you 
designers, our specialty is calibrated models. We've done hundreds of them, 
and there are very few doing such.

>I order up a years worth of weather

I don't see how one can do that. At best, you can set the actual 
temperature data into a TMY file. But you still have the old solar, 
humidity, wind speed etc. Now those data are completely incompatible with 
the hourly set of temperatures. Or do you have source for those other 
weather data? I don't believe they are being measured anymore.

>To calibrate models to reality, you must also watch out for what's

Yes, you have to include things like parking lot lights, if applicable.

As-built and as-operated. That's the whole point of a calibrated model. The 
process of calibration often reveals operational opportunities for further 
savings. As such, it is a low-cost commissioning tool.

>Calibrating models entails either incredibly detailed investigation of

nonsense. If you have only limited reference data (monthly bills), you 
don't need a detailed hourly model. A monthly simulation works fine and is 
a whole lot easier.

>or else application of the black art of making
>informed guesses ("engineering judgment").

Any modeling involves informed guesses -- eg) how do you model passive 
infiltration? At least with the calibrated model, you have a reality check.

>  In our experience, there's a
>significant portion of models that just won't calibrate, because the

Not so. The monthly bills are a cheap resource and the simulation cost is 
minimal. The only ones we have had to reject were because the metering was 
at a different level of aggregation.


>The real objective of generating reasonable energy savings estimates,
>however, can still be met if the model is overall reasonable.

How do you define reasonable? If fact, we have found that using actual 
weather, rather than TMY, may be necessary to resolve the model sufficiently.

>  It's the
>delta in energy use attributable to the efficiency measures of interests
>that matter, not necessarily tracking down all the unusual quirks of

Yeah, but if you don't have the building defined, can you be sure of the 
calculated delta? At least if you start with a calibrated model, then move 
off it incrementally, you have some confidence that the deltas are reasonable.


>Using a whole building simulation can be a big

At the last ASHRAE meeting in January, the 90.1 committee 
approved a second public review of draft Addenda e 
(Appendix G) titled "Performance Rating Method".  The draft 
addenda needs to be approved by another committee in ASHRAE 
this spring before it is made available for public comment 
which will hopefully happen early this summer.  At that 
time, the addenda will be available on the ASHRAE web site. 
 
If you are interested in Appendix G you may want to join 
the 90.1 "unofficial" mailing lists that we host for the 
full committee and ECB subcommittee.  Just send blank e-
mails to:

  SSPC901L-subscribe at gard.com

and

  901ECB-subscribe at gard.com

These will allow you to be notified of conference calls as 
well as seeing discussion regarding these committees.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200303101832.AA3223484pd80000269430@gard.com>

To calibrate models to reality, you must also watch out for what's
included in the utility bills. In the real world of utility billing
meters, there can be other extraneous energy users attached that your
model may not know about.  Things like escalators, outdoor lighting,
pool pumps, outbuildings, even parts of neighboring tenants' spaces.

And, of course, there's the difference between how equipment is supposed
to operate and how it actually operates (going beyond the "unique
operating strategies" that Michael mentions).  Sometimes equipment is
plain broken and not drawing any energy, or else it's failed in such a
way that it's drawing a lot more energy, such an an economizer damper
failed open.

Calibrating models entails either incredibly detailed investigation of
the actual building, or else application of the black art of making
informed guesses ("engineering judgment").  In our experience, there's a
significant portion of models that just won't calibrate, because the
actual energy use is too strange and resources to investigate why are
not infinite.

The real objective of generating reasonable energy savings estimates,
however, can still be met if the model is overall reasonable.  It's the
delta in energy use attributable to the efficiency measures of interests
that matter, not necessarily tracking down all the unusual quirks of
utility metering and billing systems.  In the old days, we just
calculated the expected savings of an individual measure and ignored the
rest of the building.  Using a whole building simulation can be a big
improvement on that practice.

Good luck.

Hi, I've done a few calibrations to bills, and that's
how I've done it. I order up a years worth of weather
data for the most recent year and convert it to Doe2
format. But you also need to adjust your bills in
Excel if they don't end on the 31st of the month. This
can cause some problems if they're off by quite a bit,
ie. end on the 15th. 

Also I find you need to be careful with calibrations,
as real buildings often have interesting and unique
operating strategies not modelled well by Doe2. Check
carefully how the building controls are working.

In the UTILITY-RATE command, you can specify the BILLING-DAYS to account for
billing periods that don't end on the last day of the month.  Using
BILLING-DAYS, you shouldn't normally have to prorate energy to a billing
period using Excel.  However, the algorithm cannot handle two billing days
in the same month, such as a meter read on March 2 and again on March 30.

Pat Bailey @ Geopraxis (pbailey at geopraxis.com) recently provided us with an actual weather file in DOE2 format that we are using for a similar calibration exercise.  Most (90%+) of the DOE-2 stuff we do is with new construction, so we just go ahead and start with the typical weather file.  But in the case of retrofit, where you are trying to calibrate to existing usage, I think the actual weather is the way to go.  Will let you know in a few weeks how it turns out ;-)
  
I suppose you could also do the weather normalizing separately, by comparing DOE output kW vs. metered kW in different wetbulb or drybulb bins at different times of the year.

  Hi bldg-sims: 

  After using DOE modeling tools intermittently now for many years I am now using eQuest and one of its cousins in earnest.  After reading the manuals a couple of things still are not totally evident.

  I would like to synchronize the eQuest modeled behavior to the actual utility bills for a given calendar year (so I know I modeled it properly), then apply the 30 year average data to tell me how the building should perform going forwards in a baseline mode and after EEMs are applied.

  Am I correct that the only way to do that is to take real weather data from say 2002, use some of the weather utility applications to create a suitable packed format for the DOE-2 engine, run that, make sure it is calibrated properly, then switch the weather data to 30-year data and re-run it.  

  Do most of you seasoned modelers keep two sets of all your weather data laying around, DOE-2 packed actual yearly data plus the 30 year formats?  Or isn't it worth it?

  Also, can I input actual bill histories into eQuest to compare modeled versus actual bills?

  Any suggestions would greatly be appreciated.

Am I correct that the only way to do that is to take real weather data from say 2002, use some of the weather utility applications to create a suitable packed format for the DOE-2 engine, run that, make sure it is calibrated properly, then switch the weather data to 30-year data and re-run it.  

Do most of you seasoned modelers keep two sets of all your weather data laying around, DOE-2 packed actual yearly data plus the 30 year formats?  Or isn't it worth it?

Also, can I input actual bill histories into eQuest to compare modeled versus actual bills?

Any suggestions would greatly be appreciated.

Thanks,

I would like your help, please e-mail me (jglazer at gard.com)

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200303051556.AA5602921pd80000266822@gard.com>

Greetings,
I am working on a building where my company is trying to simulate a
dedicated make up air unit.
In eQuest I am trying to use the OA-FROM-SYSTEM command and I am getting
warnings in my output files that are too numerous to describe.
My questions are as follows:
What system does the make up air unit have to be?
How do I create the make up air unit without assigning a zone?
 
Any help that any of you could provide would be greatly appreciated
