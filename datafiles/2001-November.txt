Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Efficient air-air plate heat exchangers for larger air flows
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200111050250.AA504534pd80000088879@gard.com>



Forgive me for being a bit of topic, but does any of you know a manufacturer of
efficient air-air plate heat exchangers for flows of 2000-20000 m?/h?

By "efficient" I'm thinking of a temperature efficiency by equal flows of at
least 80%. There are a number of German, Danish and Swedish manufacturers of
counterflow plate heat exchangers which make this for flows of 60-2000 m?/h.
Anyhow these flows of course is far from enough for most office buildings etc.

Kind regards
S?ren Pedersen

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] PC Problems, Possibly due to DOE2
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200111050754.AA541668pd80000088934@gard.com>

I recently experienced a rash of PC problems, including instability, EXCEL 
shutdowns, memory shortages and excessive slowdowns.  My IS administrator 
suspects this was due to the need for a simulated DOS environment to run 
DOE2 under the Windows 2000 OS.

Right now I am operating just fine with a new hard drive, newly installed 
Windows 2000 OS and a bare minimum of freshly installed software. It wasn't 
necessarily DOE2 or even DOS, but we are afraid to reinstall DOE2 until I 
receive some positive feedback form others who use DOE2 with Windows 2000.

Has anyone else had a similar experience with Windows 2000 and DOE2 (or 
possibly other DOS programs)?

Thanks,
Glenn

Ken,
 
By copy of your e-mail, I am forwarding this to a wide variety of
individuals who may have an interest in a person of Mr. Nakamura's talents
with the request that they contact you directly with any questions, comments
or expressions of interest that they may have.

Dear Bill,
 
I am writing to seek your advice and suggestions regarding Mr. Hideaki
Nakamura, a talented Japanese air conditioning design and installation
engineer who seeks a one-year internship in the U.S.  There would be no
salary required.  
 
Given your role heading research at ASHRAE and your industry expertise, I
would greatly appreciate it if you could forward my request to some
appropriate members/colleagues and let me know if you can suggest some
people I could contact on Mr. Nakamura's behalf. 
 
Mr. Nakamura was selected by International Internship Programs (IIP), a
leading non-profit international exchange organization based in Tokyo (
www.internpro.com <http://www.internpro.com>  see Professional and Cultural
Exchange Program). IIP runs professional exchange programs that provide
highly-qualified Japanese professionals with opportunities to work with
leading companies in the U.S. and gain valuable international experience.
IIP has placed over  9,000 professional in over thirty countries.

I administer the U.S. aspects of the program, including arranging
appropriate placements. IIP asked me to identify a leading American company
involved with the installation of technically advanced air conditioning and
clean room technology systems that could benefit from hosting Mr. Nakamura.


 
Mr. Nakamura is currently a senior technical engineer for Takasago Thermal
Engineering, designing and supervising the installation of commercial air
conditioning systems in Japanese office buildings, hotels, shopping malls
and hospitals.  He also has significant expertise and experience designing
and installing cold storage and clean-room systems used in high-tech
manufacturing.   Previously, he managed Takasago operations in Hong Kong. He
is interested in further developing his expertise in facility management and
building services and would like to work on the installation side of the
business.
 
Mr. Nakamura would carry his own medical and worker's compensation insurance
and would be on an Exchange Visitors Program J-visa, arranged and sponsored
by IIP.  He would contribute his time and expertise in return for the
opportunity to work with leading American professionals.  

The American host would benefit from gaining an extremely talented Japanese
professional who can make an immediate contribution, strengthen its
international operations, and make meaningful contributions to its HVAC
engineers.   Mr. Nakamura would benefit by gaining valuable cross-cultural
and international experience.  

Please let me know if you can forward my request to some appropriate
individuals and if you can be of assistance in my efforts to find Mr.
Nakamura a good host. I would be happy to fax additional information about
the program and Mr. Nakamura and answer any questions you have about the
program.  Mr. Nakamura can also be available for a phone interview.
 
Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I look forward to
hearing from you.  
 
Sincerely...Ken Balick

Hello Glenn

I recently ran thousands of simulations with DOE-2
under Windows 2000 and all ended well.
I didn't encounter the kind of problem you are talking about.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] TAS - Any Users?
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200111070831.AA310632pd80000089771@gard.com>

Greetings the UK,
I have recently subscribed to the list, and am greatly intrigued by it's
content.
I have been successfully using EDSL's TAS building simulation software for
the past 2 years, and have had some exposure to a number of other simulation
packages including IES Facet (UK) and IDA ICE (Sweden).
However, I would love to hear the advantages of the US simulation software
programs, specifically DOE and TRNSYS over for instance TAS from someone
whom has used both programs.
In other words, what (and why) is the definitive building/energy simulation
program?
So far TAS is number one for me, while it's interface is archaic it is
robust and flexible in a modelling sense, it is excellent for low energy
designs and allows innovate plant modelling (apart from waterside).
Is there any other TAS users on the list?
Thanks
Damien

Mark,

The LBL report "Commercial Heating and Cooling Loads 
Component Analysis" from 1995 uses 2.2 W/sqft for hospitals 
at 6962 hours per year.  You can also try to figure it out 
from table 6 in chapter 29 of the ASHRAE Handbook of 
Fundementals that shows individual pieces of hospital 
equipment.

IEA has done an international Survey called "Saving energy with  Energy 
Efficiency in Hospitals", Maxi Brochure 05. You can download it on 
http://caddet-ee.org/
It includes an international comparison of energy consumption per floor 
area and per bed.

If you get any more information on very highl efficient hospitals please 
let me know. We are working on a project in Belgium ourselves that aims at 
very high energy efficiency.

Our company (Thermal Energy System Specialists) is currently developing an 
entire library of co-generation equipment models for TRNSYS 15.  The 
library includes recip. engines, gas turbines, steam turbines, heat 
recovery steam generators, boilers, absorption chillers and an entire host 
of balance of system components.  The library may also include 
microturbines and fuel cells in the very near future.  The new library will 
join our other 6 component libraries that we offer as add-ons for TRNSYS 
(solar, geothermal, storage tanks, HVAC, utility, and applications) and 
should be available near the first of the year.  If you are looking for a 
specific piece of equipment please let us know as many of the models are 
already in place and have been tested.  The new library components will be 
used in-house in a series of projects resulting in the calibration of 
detailed simulation models to measured data taken at two federal facilities 
(early 2002).  If you have any questions, feel free to give us a call and 
we can discuss specifics.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] %RH problem when modeling WSHP in EnergyPro 3.1 (DOE2 frontend)
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200111121750.AA501203pd80000091272@gard.com>

Hello, 

A co-worker has run into a problem with Energy Pro (a DOE2 front end that
gives results in a CA state approved format to meet code issues). I took a
look at the .inp files and am also stumped.  Here's the issue:

We are experiencing a problem when trying to compare a PTAC unit with
electric heat to a WSHP in EnergyPro 3.1 (uses DOE2.1E-110).  When
modeling the WSHP system, the SS-N (humidity scatter plot) shows the %RH
of the space residing in the range of 0-9 for over 7000 hours per year.
The climate is the San Francisco area, on a peninsula, so this humidity
range is just not really possible with a heat pump unit.  The Water Source
Heat Pump output shows a reasonable temperature scatter plot, but does not
indicate a massive amount of reheat (which would be needed to keep a room
at 70 while magically dehumidifying to 5% rh with a heat pump).  The same
building modeled with the PTAC unit stays between 40-50% RH for most of
the year (as expected in this climate).

We believe we have the units sized appropriately, and don't expect to see
such massive over-dehumidification.  Has anyone else run into this? Is
this a bug in DOE2?  Any thoughts on trusting the energy consumption
output?  I would think not on general principle, but the results are not
too outlandish, it shows the WSHP as 15-20% lower energy consumption than
the PTAC system with electric heat. 

Thank you for any suggestions,

John Weale

Help!

We screwed up and faxed my room reservation form in August, never received a
confirmation and forgot to follow-up. Guess what - I don't have a room and
the city is `full'.
Does anyone know of an available room - a reservation for someone that can't
make it? Extra reservation? A manufacturer that booked a block that might
have spare rooms? anything? As a last resort I'll plead to share a room but
I don't want to impose just yet.

BLDG-SIM,

I found this in my Drafts folder so I assume it did not get sent!  I was
asked to share the information on the photovoltaic spec if my inquiry was
successful.  The source follows my thanks to Kurt for sending it to me.....

Thank you Kurt for forwarding me this information.  You saved the day.  We
got the submission out with the spec and the client is happy.  

Someone asked me to share the spec if I was able to get it.  I hope you
don't get a lot of requests to fax this document since it is available from
a public source.  If someone has a website they want to post it on I will
fax it to them.

Dear Group

Regarding my request last week for a source of Canadian weather BIN files
for use with DOE-2, I just wanted to forward back to the group my findings:

1) As I reported in my initial request to the group, there is no problem
with the Canadian weather files on the DOE2.com website.  It was a problem
on my end.

2) A more extensive (46 cities!) source of CWEC (Canadian Weather for Energy
Calculations) weather data in .bin format is freely distributed with
Canada's model energy code compliance software, "ee4", available from
Natural Resources Canada at:
http://buildingsgroup.nrcan.gc.ca/ee4/index.html (thanks to Brian Fountain
of Energy Advantage Inc for the link).

I also received individual files for Quebec from several other people.
Thanks to all who responded to my request!
