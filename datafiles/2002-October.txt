The Florida Solar Energy Center did three field tests with and without
shading for a residential split system and published the results in
1996.  See http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/bldg/pubs/pf302/.

In short, the authors conclude that "any savings produced by localized
AC condenser shading are quite modest (<3%) and that the risk of
interrupting air flow to the condenser may outweigh shading
considerations. The preferred strategy may be a long-term one:
locating AC condensers in an unobstructed location on the shaded north
side of buildings and depending on extensive site and
neighborhood-level landscaping to lower localized air temperatures."
The authors attributed the surprisingly small savings as being due to
the fact that the air flow volume greatly exceeds the shaded area
volume.

Hi,

I am looking for information on appropriate adjustments to entering air
temperatures for air-cooled condensers to take into account the location of
the condenser (for example, next to building and subject to solar gains,
etc.). Is any simulation program considering this, or using any such
adjustment, or is it standard practice to use information directly from the

Any information on the method used by EnergyPlus and/or DOE-2 would also be
greatly appreciated (I had no luck finding the information in the reference

Thanks!

(sorry for cross-posting...)

Dear colleagues, Chers coll?gues,  (version fran?aise ci-dessous),

The 2003 French TRNSYS user meeting will be held in Sophia Antipolis,
France, on March 24th, 2003. This 5th edition has a European dimension,
thanks to the participation of several international guests of renown.
As a matter of fact, a developer conference held just before the seminar

will unite the ?TRNSYS who?s who? in the South of France. Living legends

like William Beckman and Sandy Klein are among the expected guest, as
well as key developers of TESS, TRANSSOLAR and CSTB.

Although the official language of the seminar is French, an important
number of
presentations will be given in English.

Invited presentations include :
- the next TRNSYS version (TRNSYS 16) ? a preview
- the integration of COMIS into PREBID (TRNFLOW by TRANSSOLAR)
- and of course, as usual, the real-world project experience presented
by our users.

Use this extraordinary occasion to meet the architects and developers of

TRNSYS, to discuss with other users, or to present your projects !

The deadline for submitting presentations and/articles is January 31rd,
2003.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200210141345.AA4537812pd80000204552@gard.com>


Hi everyone,

My name is Dan Birleanu and I'm working on a project for an three stories
office building. To model this building I'm using VisualDOE.

This is a new construction and in the Base Case the building is heated and
cooled with Packaged Terminal Air Conditioning units. As VisualDOE doesn't
have an option for Packaged Terminal Heat Pump units, I have used the PTAC
template. For heating I selected an electric heat pump with supplementary
electric heating. To simulate the fans, I selected "Include in EER/COP"
method and I declared the EER and COP inputs.

For schedules, I assumed constant heating (70F) and cooling (72F)
temperatures, 24/7. I let the software to switch between heating and cooling
seasons. There is no seasonal schedules for heating or cooling.

One of the measures that we are proposing is a Building Management System
which will tide up all PTAC units under a central system. Could you please
give me some ideas how to do that? I tried to simulate that by changing the
heating and cooling temperature schedules, but the results are not
satisfactory. I declared new setback and setforward temperatures and also
different schedules for weekend days and holidays. The saving are too low.

Should I consider something else too?

Thank you,
Dan

Dear Prof. Chan 

Thank you for your interest in VisualSch and VisualConst.

VisualSch can read an EnergyPlus input file (*.idf) and extract all
schedules. Those schedules can be modified using our schedule editor.
New schedules can also be created. VisualSch can output schedules in
EnergyPlus language to an idf file.

VisualConst does not support EnergyPlus constructions right now. We do
have the plan to develop the VisualE+ which will use the VisualDOE
(www.visualdoe.com) interface and E+ as the calculation engine.

If you are interested in testing VisualE+ once it is available please
let us know. You can also try VisualDOE by downloading it from our web
site if you have not tried it before.

Hello:
 
Here's my $0.05 worth.
 
First, I doubt seriously, that DOE-2 is  +- 2 % accurate, compared to what?
This claim would need justifying. 
One way of testing DOE-2 in the near future is with ASHRAE new accuracy test
for air-side systems, 865-RP.
Tests are available for 7 systems, under varying conditions. The "accuracy"
of 865-RP has been developed
to be +- 1%, which caused the two contractors much pain, and many years of
effort.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Static Pressure Reset modeling in DOE 2


Mark, 
 
In many cases I fully agree with you about the value of keeping the problem
simple.  Indeed, we have been criticized numerous times in the past for
DOE-2's 'overly simplistic' equipment algorithms.  Interestingly, when a
couple of recent independent studies compared DOE-2's chiller and cooling
tower algorithms to more sophisticated algorithms published in the
literature, they found that DOE-2's 'simple' algorithms gave the most
accurate results. (One of these studies found that the ASHRAE Toolkit
chiller algorithm is so complex that it is next to impossible to calibrate
to manufacturer's data, and generates errors on the order of +/- 10%; while
DOE-2's accuracy was on the order of +/- 2%).
 
But I have to disagree with you in the case of variable-speed fans and
pumps. How many of you have heard the claim of VSD salemen that "power goes
as the cube of the flow"?  That claim is patently false when applied to
airhandlers and pumps.  It is only true in the case where the pressure falls
off as approximately the square of the flow, such as in a cooling tower, or
a piping system with no valves.  In the case of systems where a significant
portion of the pressure loss is associated with non-turbulent components,
pressure losses do not follow the flow-squared law.  And a fixed pressure
setpoint further reduces the potential savings.  In fact, if the pressure
setpoint is set high enough, the VSD will run at full speed regardless of
flow (I have observed this situation).
 
So it can make sense for DDC control systems to reset the setpoint as a
function of the pressure requirement of the worst case component (but watch
out for the rogue VAV box or coil!)  And, since one of our goals is to allow
engineers to utilize DOE-2 to study the cost-effectiveness of more
sophisticated control sequences, the program needs to do a better job of
simulating this situation.  Granted, we will keep the algorithms as simple
as is consistent with this goal!  And the default control sequence will
utilize a fixed setpoint so everyone can keep asking "how come the power
consumption doesn't drop off as the cube of the flow, like the salesman told
me?"

Currently there is no "optimized static pressure control" for fans/ducts in
DOE-2.  However, J. Hirsch & Associates has funding to implement such a
mechanism in DOE-2.2 within the next few months.  The funding is provided by
Southern California Edison as part of their "Energy Design Resources"
program ( http://www.energydesignresources.com/
<http://www.energydesignresources.com/> ).  These enhancement will be
incorporated into both DOE-2.2 and eQUEST (not PowerDOE), and will be made
available to the user community at no charge.
 
This control mechanism will be similar to the head reset controls already
implemented for variable-flow pumping systems in DOE-2.2, where the pump
head setpoint can be reset based on the hourly head demand of the worst-case
valve. The actual pump head is then a function of the worst-case valve head,
plus the additional variable-flow head losses of the loop piping and the
central plant equipment.  This control sequence maximizes the potential
savings of variable-speed pumps, as the required speed of a pump is
dependent on both the flow as well as the head requirement; with the head
requirement usually being the dominant factor. (The maximum head of a pump
varies roughly as the square of the impeller speed; if the head requirement
does not decrease as the flow drops off, then the speed cannot decrease
significantly).
 
For fans/ducts, the simple curve-fit that varies fan power as a function of
flow will become obsolete. Instead, DOE-2.2 will keep track of the static
requirement of the worst-case VAV box, as well as ducting, coils, filters,
etc.  Each component must be accounted for separately, as the head of all of
these devices varies differently for a given flow.  (Some components, such
as ducts and sound traps, experience turbulent flow, and their head varies
as the 1.85 power of flow.  Other components, such as coils and filters, are
more laminar, and their head typically varies in the range of the 1.1-1.6
power of flow.  Still others, such as a VAV box without an intelligent DDC
system to monitor damper position, will have a constant head requirement;
i.e. a constant head setpoint out toward the end of the ducting.)  These
changes will require DOE-2.2 to know about the flow through each component
in the system, the component's head characteristic, as well as the fan map
for a given type of fan (forward-curved, airfoil, etc.)  Based on flow and
static requirement, DOE-2.2 will then be able to determine the fan speed and
power consumption.  
 
In the meantime, you can approximate "optimized static pressure control" by
generating a new curve that causes power to fall off more rapidly with flow
than the default curves.  However, this is not a straightforward task, as
you would have to calculate by hand all of the algorithms we have designed
for DOE-2, and repeat the calculations for a series of flows.  Perhaps
someone has already done this exercise, and can share their curves with you.

Hello,
 
Does anybody know if there is a way to model (in DOE-2) an "optimized static
pressure control", that is a control method where the controller dynamically
adjusts the static pressure set point based on the position of the
modulating devices in the VAV terminal units?

Hi;
If you consider both heat and moisture flux (absorption), roof surface properties will have even more impact on load. I applied this to bridge decks to reduce surface freezing and had significant results.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Indirect Evaporative Cooling
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200210081147.AA4732796pd80000202227@gard.com>

Hello,

I'm analyzing a building with a central plant, and would like to simulate pre-cooling the outside air using indirect evaporative
cooling, using relief air as the secondary stream.  Does anyone know how to do this with DOE2?  (I've been using 2.2, but let me
know if there's a solution in any version)

Not knowing how to simulate this exact situation, I've tried to simulate indirect evaporative cooling using outside air as the
secondary stream.  However, this gave me results that I don't believe.  Specifically, after adding evaporative cooling our increased
fan energy dwarfed any chiller savings.  Although this is possible if the climate is mild enough, in that case the demand should
still be reduced.  According to some spreadsheet calculations, we should save ~40kW in demand from the reduction in chiller size,
and gain ~10kW in fans.  However, in the simulation results the demand increases by ~200 kW.

Here are the commands I had  added:
   EVAP-CL-TYPE     = INDIRECT
   EVAP-CL+M-SUP    = TOGETHER
   EVAP-CL+REC-RA   = YES

Does anyone know of oddities in modeling indirect evaporation that I should know about?

Thanks,

Hello,
 
Some years ago we published a work that presented a sensitivity analysis
of building's energy performance in a hot-humid climate (Tel Aviv)
to the values assigned to various design parameters among them Roof
color. It was done for a standard heavily constructed apartment building
block, using the simulation model ENERGY developed by Shaviv and Shaviv.
The results show that the influence is dependent on the roof insulation
and can be positive or negative during different seasons.

Hello:
 
Here's my $0.05 worth.
 
First, FSEC, LBNL and others have done lots and lots of work on this...and
the "results" are very dependent on what is going on 
below the roof. For example, if there are ducts, what model is used, etc.
Information about what they have
done can be found in papers by Parker, and Fairey, etc.
 
Second, to be correct, one needs a simulation model that has radiation and
natural convection calculated 
correctly in the attic -- usually outside the domain of DOE-2, or powerDOE,
for example see the work by 
Mario Medina et al. at the University of Kansas.
 
Third, if one insists on using DOE-2 we have found that it makes a big
difference when one turns on the
CUSTOM-WEIGHTING-FACTORS by setting the floor weight equal to zero.  This,
of course needs
lots of other things, like a different floor model, and real materials,
etc., not for the faint-of-heart.
 
Finally, I have my doubts about DOE-2's radiative coupling to the sky, its
"rain" simulation, and its "dewpoint" assumptions,
based on some simulations that we have made where we compared the data from
measured attic temperatures from a Habitat House that
showed the simulation losing more heat than the real attic did --
interesting stuff that will be presented in a paper someday, report
available from the ESL soon.
 
Here's an annotated bibliography that we recently prepared for the
California Energy Commission on the topic.

This paper discusses about field data documenting the effect of white roofs
that has been found to reduce the air conditioning load in individual
buildings in California and Florida by between 10% and 50%, depending on the
thickness of insulation beneath the roof. In addition 'cool' roofs can limit
or reverse the urban heat island effect and can reduce low-level ozone
concentrations. The paper also presents simulated savings for several U.S.
metropolitan areas and briefly discusses policy and implementation issues
such as ratings and ASHRAE standards.

Savings of Light-colored Roofs: Results from Three California Demonstration
Sites. ACEEE 1998 Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings: Efficiency
& Sustainability, Vol. 3, pp. 3.1-3.12. 

 

This study demonstrated the impact of roof albedo in reducing cooling energy
use in three commercial buildings in California. Increasing the roof
reflectance from about 20% to 60% dropped the roof temperature on hot summer
afternoon by about 45?F. Savings are a function of both climate and the
amount of roof insulation. The cooling energy savings for reflective roofs
are highest in hot climates. A reflective roof may also lead to higher
heating energy use. Reflective coatings are also used in commercial building
to protect the roofing membrane. Reflectivity of coatings changes with
weathering and aging which have an effect on building cooling-energy
savings.

Emissivity of Roofs on Building Cooling and Heating Energy Use. Proceedings

Envelopes of Buildings VII, Clearwater Beach, FL., pp. 29-39. 

 

This paper summarizes the result of computer simulations and analyses the
impact of roof albedo and emissivity on heating and cooling energy use. The
simulations are performed for eleven representative climates throughout the
country. Several residential and commercial prototypical buildings are
considered for these simulations. In hot climates, changing the roof
emissivity from 0.9 (emissivity of most nonmetallic surfaces) to 0.25
(emissivity of fresh and shiny metallic surfaces) can result in a net 10%
increase in annual utility bills. In colder climates, the heating energy
savings approximately cancel out the cooling energy penalties from
decreasing the roof emissivity. In very cold climates with no summertime
cooling, the heating energy savings resulting from decreasing the roof
emissivity can be up to 3%.

This paper summarizes the results of a simulation effort in support of
ASHRAE SSPC 90.1 for the inclusion of reflective roofs in the proposed
standard. Simulation results include the annual electricity and fuel use for
two building types, residential and non-residential. The 90.1 Envelope
Subcommittee DOE-2 prototype building and operating schedules were used. The
parametric simulations were performed for 19 climate bins, as defined in the
current 90.1 draft; a range of roof absorptivities from 0.25 to 0.95; and
three roof U-factors (corresponding to roof insulation of R3, R11, and R38).
The results are condensed into climate-dependent adjustment factors to
reduce roof insulation for buildings with reflective roofs such that the net
energy use of the building stays constant when compared with the energy use
of a dark-colored roof.

This paper discusses the results of a simulation effort in support of ASHRAE
SSPC 90.2 for inclusion of reflective roofs in the proposed standard.
Simulation results include the annual electricity and fuel use for a
prototypical single-family one-story house. The 90.2 Envelope Subcommittee
DOE-2 prototype building and operating schedules were used. The parametric
simulations were performed for the following scenarios and combinations
thereof: 3 heating systems, 4 duct and duct insulation configurations, 5
levels of roof reflectivity, and 4 levels of attic air change rate. The
simulations were performed for 32 climate regions. The results are condensed
into climate-dependent adjustment factors that equivalent reductions in roof
insulation levels corresponding to increased roof reflectivity. Results
indicate that in hot climates, increasing the roof reflectivity from 20% to
60% is worth over half of the roof insulation.

This study discusses the measured saving in air-conditioning electricity use
which resulted from painting roofs white and planting shade trees for six
houses and a school bungalow in Sacramento, CA. Preliminary data indicate
the painting roof white of one of the houses eliminated air-conditioning
energy use about 12 kWh/day and 2.3 kW in peak power. Painting the roof and
one wall of a school bungalow white reduced its air-conditioning energy use
by over 50%. Shading the west windows, south windows, and air-conditioning
condenser units of two houses with trees appear to have lowered cooling
electricity use by 10 to 40%.

 

Akridge, J. M. (1998). High-albedo Roof Coating - Impact on Energy

The paper addresses the recent tests conducted on a 12,000ft? single-story
building used as an educational center identified high roof temperatures as
a significant problem. The galvanized roof frequently reached temperatures
above 180?F. Considerable heat energy reached the non-ventilated attic,
resulting in temperatures as high as 105degF during the peak of summer.
Although the HVAC units were equipped with insulated return ducts, these
temperatures increased energy conduction through the duct insulation and
through the ceiling insulation into the conditioned space. The roof was
coated on March 28 and 29, 1995, with a high-albedo acrylic coating
developed to control thermal gain and rust. Tests show installation of the
thermal-control roof coating reduced the peak roof temperature to 120?F and
significantly decreased the energy flow through the roof and ceilings. Tests
show that the high-reflectivity roof coating reduced HVAC energy consumption
in a range from 8.7% to 27.5%, depending on the solar radiation and the
ambient temperature.

 

Anderson, R. W. (1989). Radiation Control Coatings: An Underutilized Energy
Conservation Technology for Buildings. ASHRAE Transactions, Vol. 95, Pt. 2,

The paper points out that the application of radiation control coatings
(RCCs) to exterior roof and wall surfaces can effectively block solar heat
gains and significantly reduce cooling energy consumption and the sizing of
cooling equipment in warm climates. The application of RCCs remains
underutilized and is not yet recognized in building energy codes. The paper
discusses the status of RCC technology and the benefits to be gained from
the use of RCCs, including estimated reductions in cooling requirements and
energy consumption and suggests projects to demonstrate the full potential
of RCCs technology for building applications.

ACEEE 1994 Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings: Efficiency &
Sustainability, Vol. 9, pp. 9.65-9.75.

The study addresses the aging characteristics of high-albedo roofs.
Twenty-six spot albedo measurements of roofs were made using a calibrated
pyranometer. The decrease in albedo depends on the coating itself, the
texture of the surface, the slope of the roof and the nearby sources of dirt
and debris. The largest decrease in albedo occurs in the first year, at a
reduction of about 20%. After the second year, the incremental decrease in
albedo can be small, lowering saving estimates by 10-20%. Washing the
high-albedo coatings returned the albedo to 90-100% of the estimated
original value but it is not cost-effective if only concerned with
cooling-energy saving.

Performance of APP-modified Bitumen Roof Membranes Coated with Reflective
Coatings. Proceedings of the ASHRAE/DOE Conference on Thermal Performance of

A multi-faceted field research program regarding seven atactic polypropylene
(APP) modified bitumen membrane roof systems and four reflective coatings
began in 1991. This long-term project is evaluating the performance of
various APP-modified bitumen membranes (both coated and uncoated), the
comparative performance of coating application soon after membrane
installation versus pre-weathering, coating performance, and aspects of
recoating. Reports progress on the in-situ thermal performance of the
various types of coated membranes compared to the thermal performance of the
exposed membranes. The thermal performance of an adjacent ballasted ethylene
propylene diene terpolymer (EPDM) roofing system is also described.

in the Use of Aluminium Chips as a Reflective Surface for Commercial
Roofing. Proceedings of the ASHRAE/DOE Conference on Thermal Performance of

The paper contains the information of using thin aluminium chips as a
reflective surface for commercial roofing. Chips can be field or factory
applied. Solar reflectivity measurements indicate that approximately 70% of
the full solar spectrum is reflected. A brief review of the early roofing
projects indicates that retained reflectivity and extended roof life are
being achieved. The paper describes characteristics of such roofing
surfaces, how the product is applied to roofs, and the experience to date in
their application and performance.

This paper explains the idea of using thin aluminum chips as a reflective
surface for commercial roofing. The paper states about reflectivity of the
chips (approximately 70%) that more than 96% is still retained over 10
years. Advantages of roof temperature reduction, roof life as well as
characteristics of roofing surface, how the product is applied to roofing,
and the experience to date in their application and performance are also
described.

Effects of Reflective Roofing. ACEEE 1996 Summer Study on Energy Efficiency
in Buildings: Efficiency & Sustainability, Vol. 4, pp. 4.117-4.124.

 

This paper describes a function that was written to incorporate the attic
heat transfer processes into the DOE-2 building energy simulation. This
function adds radiative, convective and conductive equations to the energy
balance of the roof. Results of the enhanced DOE-2 model were compared to
measured data collected from a school bungalow in a Sacramento Municipal
Utility District monitoring project. The function improves the accuracy of
DOE-2 in modeling the effects of high albedo roofing but still over-predicts
the daily energy use of both high and low albedo roofs. The yearly energy
savings of a white roof may be as much as four times higher than is
currently predicted by DOE-2.

1626-1642.

 

The paper is the study about the thermal effects of black versus white
membranes on an insulated low slope roof over an 18 month period. White or
black polyisobutylene (PIB) membrane was used. Seasonal distinctions in the
measured data between black and white membranes are reported. Included are
cumulative and instantaneous heat fluxes and hourly surface temperature
variations. Peak membrane temperatures were observed to differ by up to 50
?F during the day. Nighttime differences in membrane surface temperatures
were negligible. Changes due to dirt accumulation and local environmental
factors were observed in surface reflectance values calculated from the
energy balance at the roof membrane and from reflectometer measurements.

White Roofs on Building Energy Loads. ASHRAE Transactions, Vol.104, Pt. 1B,
pp. 810-818. 

 

The study states the impact of white roof coatings on energy loads in three
non-residential buildings in Sacramento. Hourly metered loads were designed
to isolate the effects of white roof coatings on building cooling loads from
changes in cooling loads due to variations in outdoor temperatures. Basic
multiple linear regression model used to weather normalize energy
consumption data was expanded to include hourly solar radiation or
insolation levels as explanatory variables, along with explanatory variables
representing outdoor temperatures. Results indicate that the effect of solar
insolation levels on cooling energy consumption was significantly decreased
after the application of white roofs in all three buildings. Savings
estimates based on this approach range from 17% to 39% of total cooling
loads, or .35kWh to .68kWh per square foot of treated roof area per year.

Proceedings of the ASHRAE/DOE Conference on Thermal Performance of the

This paper studies a series of side-by-side tests using model roof
assemblies have been conducted to determine the potential of radiant
barriers for enhancing the thermal microclimate of local domestic,
single-storey low-cost housing, for tropical climates. A comparative system
was adopted, using two identical test models, one an unchanging reference
and the other a test unit for examining the behavior of various radiant
barrier and ceiling configurations. The paper presents the design details of
the outdoor testing system used and the results of comparative testing of
aluminium foil and aluminium paint with regard to their effectiveness as
radiant barriers. Experimental results showed that the low-cost aluminium
paint, although not as effective as aluminium foil, does have an enhancing
effect on the thermal performance of the roof assembly system.

This paper contains information of five final case studies out of ten case
studies that the Florida Solar Energy Center conducted in Florida during
midsummer over a period of four years. The studies measured the effect of
increasing the roof surface solar reflectance on air conditioning energy
use. The studies did not recommend painting or coating a conventional
shingle roof white because it can lead to potential moisture damage. In all
locations, reflective roofs reduced space-cooling varying from 13% to 58%.
Heating consumption was increased only slightly, from 3% to 6%.

Guide for Estimating Potential Energy Savings from Increased Solar
Reflectance of a Low-sloped Roof. Proceedings of the ASHRAE/DOE Conference
on Thermal Performance of the Exterior Envelopes of Buildings IV, Orlando,
FL., pp. 348-357. 

 

This paper describes the methodology and limitations of an easy-to-use guide
for calculating energy and cost saving resulting from a change in the solar
reflectance of a low-slope roof. The guide provides data and calculation
procedures for estimating energy and cost savings. In most instances, the
cooling cost savings associated with a change to a white roof surface (one
with higher solar reflectance) exceed the heating cost penalty. If the
difference between reduced cooling costs and increased heating costs is
significant, it can affect the choice of membrane for a new roof or a
re-roofed building. The guide helps the user estimate this energy cost
difference and also describes how various factors influence potential energy
savings and actual roof surface temperatures for different solar
reflectance.

the roof surface solar reflectance on air conditioning energy use and shows
that reflective roofs can reduce space-cooling energy consumption and demand
in Florida. The savings is about 10-40% that is around 440 to 1760 kWh per
year for household electricity use or an annual saving of $35-$140 at
current electricity rates (assuming 8 cents per kWh). The savings will vary
depending upon the severity of the cooling season and roof insulations. The
paper discusses the payback concern of reflective roofing which overall
application would cost about $1 per ft? or approximately $2,200 for a
typical home. With annual energy saving in Florida of $35-$140, the payback
times are long, usually, lasting longer than the roof itself.

Roof Coatings in Florida. ASHRAE Transactions, Vol. 100, Pt. 2, pp. 36-49.

 

This study presents experiments about the impact of reflective coating on
air conditioning energy use that were applied to the roof of two residential
buildings in Cocoa Beach, Florida, in the summer of 1992. Site 1 with
approximately R-11 (RSI 1.9) ceiling insulation and Site 2 with a flat roof
with no insulation. Reflective coatings were applied to the roofs of both
residences in mid-summer. Analysis revealed substantial reductions in
space-cooling energy use in both homes. Air-conditioning energy use was
reduced by approximately 25% at Site 1. Utility coincident peak demand
between 5 and 6 p.m. was reduced by 28%. Cooling energy savings at the
uninsulated Site 2 home were approximately 43% and the coincident peak
reduction was 38%.

Systems in Residential Buildings. ASHRAE Transactions, Vol.104, Pt. 1B, pp.
963-975.

 

This paper contains information about a series of experiments in Florida
residences that have measured the impact of increasing roof solar
reflectance on space cooling. In tests on eleven homes with the roof colour
changed in mid-summer, the average cooling energy use was reduced by 19%.
Measurements and infrared thermography show that a significant part of the
savings is due to interactions when the duct system is located in the attic
space. An improved residential attic and duct simulation model, taking these
experimental results into account, has been implemented in the DOE-2.1E
building energy simulation program. The model was then used to estimate the
impact of reflective roofing in fourteen climatic locations around the
United States.

The paper reports on the first results from tests on a reflective roofing
system on a commercial building in Florida. The building is an elementary
school with a sloped, modified bitumen roof. Air conditioning power was
measured in a base configuration prior to the roofing system being changed
to a white colour. Roof, decking, and plenum air temperatures were strongly
affected by the change to a white roof system. The school, which was
monitored for a full year in both the pre- and post-condition, saw the
measured annual chiller electric power reduced by 10%, or 13,000kWh/yr.
Cooling-load reductions during the utility summer peak were substantially
greater, more than 30% during the afternoon hours.

Coatings Installed on Rough-surfaced Built-up Roofs: Initial Test Results.
ASHRAE Transactions, Vol. 95, Pt. 2, pp. 795-809.


This paper is a study on the solar reflectance and thermal performance of
small samples of various radiation control coatings on smooth surfaces that
have been tracked for several years on a roof test facility in East
Tennessee. The focus is on white coatings because of their potential to
weather, which causes the solar reflectance to decrease as the coatings age.
An extension of the study included more small samples on smooth surfaces and
entire rough-surfaced roofs at a federal facility in Florida. Two
rough-surfaced, moderately well insulated, low solar reflectance built-up
roofs (BURs) were spray-coated with a latex-based product including ceramic
beads. Only a small patch was left uncoated on each BUR to gather data
throughout the project on the performance with no coating for direct
comparison to data from instrumented coated areas. The average power demand
during occupied periods for the first month with the coating for the
building with the thermally massive roof deck was 13% less than during the
previous month without the coating. For the other building, with a
lightweight roof deck but high internal loads, there were no clear average
power savings due to the coating.

Monitoring Plus Roof and Whole Building Modeling. Proceedings of the
ASHRAE/DOE Conference on Thermal Performance of the Exterior Envelopes of
Buildings VII, Clearwater Beach, FL., pp. 353-371. 

 

This paper updates and completes the presentation of data for this New
Technology Demonstration Programme (NTDP) project. The paper discusses the
effect of radiation control coatings on rough-surfaced, low-slope roofs at a
federal facility in the Panhandle of Florida. Two gravel-topped, moderately
well-insulated, low solar reflectance built-up roofs (BURs) were spray
coated with a white, latex-based product with ceramic beads. One roof was
significantly shaded and its building had high internal loads. The other had
a thermally massive deck but its building had little internal load.
Measurements show the history of coated and uncoated outside-surface
temperatures and solar reflectance of the roof surfaces from July 1996, when
the roofs were coated, through October 1997. Roof models based on
one-dimensional transient conduction through the roofs are used to compare
the heat fluxes through the roof deck for coated and uncoated roof surfaces.
DOE-2.1E whole building annual energy use predictions specific to the
buildings and their operating schedules show the effect of the coatings and
other building features for the climatic conditions of the Florida
Panhandle.

Proceeding of the ACEEE 1992 Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings:
Efficiency & Sustainability, Vol. 9, pp. 9.141-9.144. 

 

This study discusses about the problem of summer urban heat islands that
requires significant additional generating capacity and results in increased
pollutant emissions and higher energy bills. Urban areas can be lightened
through use of high-albedo materials for both building and urban surfaces.
The paper estimates that heat island reduction savings of $1 billion could
be realized through utility-sponsored demand-side management (DSM) programs
that promote the whitening and greening of cities. Assuming these utilities
are permitted to retain 10% of program savings, then they could earn about
$100 million/year.

I know a researcher at LBNL that has done a significant amount of work on
cool roofs. I have taken the liberty to forward the previous emails to him
to see if he can provide any enlightenment. There are numerous papers in the
peer reviewed literature that you may want to look at.

  Oh Contrair.
   I ran load calcs for a 100,000 square foot single story big box store in
the Burlington, VT area last year to determine what if any benefits would
result from changing the flat membrane roof color from dark to light.
Occupancy was typical urban sprawl well-known national retailers.

  Peak air conditioning roof  heat gain was reduced by 50%.

  Roof was insulated to about R-22, plenum return, packaged DX rooftops.
Ran the numbers using Carrier HAP.  Annual AC energy savings came in at
about 3%.  Software did show a *slight* heating season penalty, but that was
because the software did not account for the usual snow cover on a Vermont
roof in winter. There was a worthwhile installed tonnage reduction also.

If you model energy savings for roofing products, be sure to account for
smog.  Yes I'm in Los Angeles.  But ASHRAE does also note that energy
savings is negligible in industrial areas due to smoke and smog.  I believe
the real point here is that unless the direct irradiation level is high then
there isn't much chance of savings.  The diffuse irradiation will have the
same affect on a wall as it does a roof--White paint or rock anyone (as
opposed to snowcap type products)?  Your point about New England's latitude
would fit in here about the diffuse radiation part.  Additionally, I do
recall that there was a researcher at LBL who was educating people about
albedo (smooth vs. fluffy) as a surface property that needs to also be
addressed; this is in addition to abosorptance, reflectance, and
emisstivity.
 
I do not believe very highly in the accuracy of the energy performance
estimates for the high performance roofing products.  All you need is a hazy
month in June, and you've got more savings then the prior year.  Wash the
roof, for that matter, and the results will change.
 
My point is, don't expect much from your model, and expect less in real
life.

Whenever we have modeled this in the Northeast we also have seen negligible 
savings using PowerDOE and others.

We have come to the conclusion that the savings depend upon the amount of 
roof insulation and type of building.  If we enter minimal insulation the 
effect of a white roof is larger especially in a cooling dominated 
building, high internal loads, etc.

If you are installing even moderate amounts of insulation (R15 or more) 
then the effect of a white roof in the Northeast is virtually nil for most 
any building type.

Now when it comes to the urban heat island effect it can have a 
tremendously positive impact . . . but that is another issue.

There is a DOE22 keyword called  "OUTSIDE-EMISS" which I think can be
modified to represent a Cool Roof, along with the "ABSORPTANCE" keyword that
you mentioned. When I attempted to model a Cool Roof, I also didn't see any
big results until I found the "OUTSIDE-EMISS" keyword.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] "Cool Roofing"


Has anyone had any success modeling cool roofing options (i.e. reflective or
light colored surfaces) in PowerDOE?  So far, I have seen negligible results
from the adjustment of roof construction absorptance values (emissivity is
also known to play a role, but there is no input for this in PowerDOE).  I
have seen data showing cooling energy savings from 0.06 to 0.54 kWh/sqft/yr,
depending on building type.  I am getting only a very small fraction of
this.  Data collected in the study was from facilities in the southern and
western US, and I work primarily on buildings in the Northeast.
 
My questions:
How well can I expect PowerDOE to simulate this?  Is there a better way to
simulate cool roofing?  Is the sun simply too low in the sky in New England
to yield substantial savings?
 
Your thoughts are appreciated.

Do you have to zone the building so all 42 air cooled units are distinct? Or
can you combine them into, say, 5-8 mega units?
 
Also, make sure you model by facing direction and either a single or two
interior zones.
 
You could also combine mid floors (2-9), if, again, you don't need to be
precise on the 42 units' zoning.

I am modeling a 10 storey 40*40 sq.m building with large atrium which is
served by multiple (42 units) air cooled, 
split type AC ( AC supplying air through ducts to various spaces) using the
Micro-DOE2.1E
 
Does anyone have any input similiar with this kind of building, so I can
learn furthermore how to model correctly?

To Building Performance Simulationists far and wide:

Since 1998, the IBPSA News has been published only in PDF 
format on the IBPSA web site, http://www.ibpsa.org 
<http://www.ibpsa.org/> .  Please look there for past 
issues (we've already had two this year.)  

We are hoping to have a third issue in early to mid-
November, so please get your simulation news items to me as 
soon as possible.  Anything relating to simulation ==> 
conferences, awards, seminars, workshops, new software (no 
advertisements please, unless you want to pay).  We like 
color, and we like actual articles if we have your 
permission to publish.  

The CUT-OFF date for items for this next issue will be 25 
October.  

Thanks and best wishes.
