Subject: [BLDG-SIM] HVAC efficiency
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F199903310816.AA164167MD35163@gard.com>

Hello everybody!

My name is Jose Hernandez, an 'almost' Mechanical Engineer, specialized in
Heat and Fluids. I am currently developing a project about how to predict
the efficiency of an HVAC system. That means predicting, not measuring, the
efficiency of the system before the real efficiency is obtained through
heat requirements and fuel consumption.
Has anyone had to do something similar in your work or research?
Do you know any instituion that have developped any method to predict the
seasonal efficiency of the whole system or of the boiler, delivery,
emission and control sub-systems taking into account parameters such as
use, occupancy and climate?
Any information will be greated, but I prefer attachment, articles (easy to
find) and information in Internet.
Thanks a lot.

Dear List members

Thanks for the info regarding French Climatic files.
ubject: Elimination Parametrics


Dear Mr Franta

I read* recently about ultra low energy building simulations that have
used a parametric elimination technique developewd by Greg Franta in the
US.  Would it be possible to obtain some information on this technique?

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] "Chimney Effect" modeling, have any ideas
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F199903181437.AA375204MD33001@gard.com>

Stratification effects are quite easily modeled using Computational Fluid
Dynamics.  Unforunately, it is not feasible to model these effects over a
long time period such as a year.  The best approach is to create snapshot
models of various different conditions and usage situations.  The CFD
program will then show the amount of stratification or buoyantly induced
air flow through the space.  These numbers can then be put into DOE2 using
a schedule or a macro or some other function.

I know one of the ASHRAE handbooks has some calculations for calculating stack
effect for buildings... not sure which handbook, or possibly the ASHRAE
Heating/Cooling load calc book.

Here in Vermont our tallest building is something like 12 stories high.
However, a few years ago I helped a client with a 250,000 sq. foot hospital
wing, 8 stories high.

The basic problem was excessive infiltration at the main entrance lobby,
especially in severe Winter conditions.  There were several elements at play,
but these were the most significant:

Six elevator shafts, running from lobby elevation to rooftop,  with a machine
room above the shafts.  Each shaft had an opening in top of shaft with a grate
between shaft and machine room.  The grated opening is required by code for
smoke evacuation.  The machine room had a propellor exhaust fan blowing out,
with fresh air louvers on opposite wall.

So much heat gain from elevator motors kept that exhaust fan running almost all
the time, even in Winter.  The fan was sucking large volumes of air out of the
shafts, and was assisted by the thermal Winter stack effect (chimney effect),
even though the make-up air louvers were sized porperly and functioning normal.

To solve the shaft opening problem, I installed UL smoke dampers in the grated
opening.  Damper were pneumatic, Normally Open (N.O.).  The dampers stayed
closed all the time, except when fire alarm activated, when the pneumatic EP
would relieve air pressure, opening the dampers.

The State of Vermont accepted the scheme..... it conformed to the code intent.

Look closely at the top of an open elevatror cab and you will see a 3 to 4 inch
gap between open door and shaft wall.

Also,  entrance vestibules should have enough distance between the two sets of
doors so one door set is always closed..  Very hard to accomplish in high
traffic areas.  This is how I learned why those big New York style high rise
buildings use revolving doors....  prevents infiltration.

Infiltration from stack effect is usually difficult to solve as well as
difficult to calculate.  A lot of variables, and many are hard to pin down.

Not sure if this addresses your atrium problem...... hope this helps.

Colleagues,

You may already know about the web-based
directory of software tools for energy efficiency,
renewable energy, and sustainability in buildings.

If you don't know about the directory or haven't
visited recently, you may be surprised.  The
directory has been completely redesigned and
now contains info on almost 150 tools. (Info on 15
tools has been added in the last two months.)

URL:   www.eren.doe.gov/buildings/tools_directory/

The site also includes links to other simulation-related
sites such as IBPSA and ASHRAE TC 4.7 and information
about software development activities at DOE.

If you develop software or know of software that
you think should be listed in the directory, please
contact me.  The information we need to add a tool
to the directory is also shown on the web:

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Solar cooling
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F199903120545.AA452900MD31640@gard.com>

Hello all,

I'm just  joining this list, and I find it very active and efficient.

So, as europeans seem rather rare, I take a few minutes to
present my company and to send a question.

Tecsol is an engineering office (consultant) and has 3 main activities:
- traditionnal HVAC engineering, mainly  for public projects (hospitals,
swimming pools, residential buildings or hotels). It includes of course
energy management, optimizing,...
- use of renewable energies (mainly solar and wind): rural electrification,
solar DHW production (large systems), pv connected to the grid. In this
domain, we include studies of projects and realizations, but also
market studies or specific software development.
- internet sites development and hosting, concerning energy, public
services, and cars(!). 

We work at the european level, in France, Spain or Germany and also
in Morocco, Tunisia and Latin America (Cuba, Brazil) through many
different contracts with the European Commission or the french government.
Unfortunately, we don't have opportunities to collaborate with U.S.
companies:
generally, europeans and U.S.' people are competitors, and there is no
public money to encourage this collaboration. But this is another
discussion...

So, my request now: we use TRNSYS 14.2 to simulate a solar cooling system.
This system exists and we have a telemonitoring equipment on it: solar
vacuum
tubes (130 m2) and Yazaki absorption machine (50 kW). The basic type 56 of
TRNSYS is not enough to test some particular improvements.
Does anybody work on this subject ? With which tools ? 
Do you know any recent realization of this type which we could visit, or at
least
contact ?

Thank you very much for your help.

Bill,

I happened to have your info handy. PG&E has done a study every two
years to find
average annual end-use intensities on a square footage basis. The most
recent copy
is the 1997 Commercial Building Survey Report. I can send you a PDF copy
if you
would like it (~900kB).

Here is their breakdown for Hospitals (annual kWh per square foot):

Cooling 4.99
Heating 44.73
Vent 10.49
Refrig 0.89
DHW 1.07
Cooking 1.30
Lighting (interior) 7.14
Other 2.71

Hope this helps.

- Jim

Bill,

Lighting can be all over for existing buildings since so 
many improvements have been made in the last ten years.  
One point of reference is the latest draft of ASHRAE 
Standard 90.1 that allows 1.6 W/sqft overall for the entire 
hospital building and specific spaces being 1.0 W/sqft in 
the nursery, 1.2 in the patient rooms, 2.8 in the emergency 
room and 7.6 in the operating room.  Altogether they have 
over twenty different spaces identified for a hospital.  
These are supposed to represent efficient lighting options 
that are cost effective - I believe it is appropriate to 
consider them less than the state of the art.

DOE-2 can calculate shading from an energy impact 
perspective but better a better program would probably be a 
daylighting visualization program.

See

Go to "other applications"  than "solar?climate analysis"

I'm looking for some rules-of thumb for energy use by end-use for
hospitals.
I'm particularly interested in the electricity use for lighting at the
present
time.  Percentages of the total electricity use would be fine.

I'm seeking this information just to use for reasonableness checks.  I have
a
copy of a completed lighting audit that has numbers I don't think are
reasonable.  The hospital whose use I'm investigating is located in San
Francisco.

I would be interested in a good source for this type of information as well
as
the information itself.

Thanks, Bill

Bill,

Equipment audits do not say anything about unnecessary lighting; changing lamps
and fixtures is relatively trivial, given the will and an adequate budget.  

What is reasonable?  8-10 W/sq.ft. in an operating room *is* reasonable during
surgery; it is *not* reasonable when nobody is there.  3-4 W/sq.ft. in emergency
rooms is reasonable; 1 W/sq.ft. "on" in an unused space is not.  Wasteful use of
electrical lighting is a "wicked" problem.  Its prevention starts with zoning of lighting, sensors, electrical lighting controls, education and incentives. You
may want to add these to your assessment.

Hello all,

Happy and excited to join this forum.

My name is Tianzhen Hong, currently working in Supersymmetry Services
(www.supersym.com.sg), a company working in cleanroom design and building
energy efficiency area.

I have interests in building simulation since college days in 1988. Through
participating in dozens of projects, I have published 7 papers in Building
and Environment, and Energy and Buildings. All are available as PDF files @
http://members.xoom.com/Euler/resume.html#PUBLICATION

One of the papers (bsfaq.pdf) "Building Simulaion: An overview of
development and information sources" tries to provide some FAQs for this
area. Of course the paper was written two years ago and much information
needs update.

Nice to share something with everybody.

Cheers

Tianzhen

A brief introduction of myself to others on this new list.

As an HVAC designer, with about 20 years experience in the consulting
engineering field, my primary scope of work is HVAC system design and
energy analysis of commercial and institutional facilities, with a
health care facilities and labs my area of strength. Also specify
automated controls for HVAC DDC systems employing hi-performance
sequences of operation, as preached by Thos. Hartman and others.

I operate a home office in the Burlington, Vermont area.  Not far from
the edge of the earth.  Guess you could call me a front line HVAC
designer.

The Carrier Hourly Analysis Program (HAP) program is the software system
I use for heavy duty simulation, having used the Carrier software since
1985.  My selection of Carrier software is based on knowledge and
experience with the software, not based on an analysis of other
competitive systems out in the market.  A desire to avoid a steep
leaning curve is my primary basis of selection, as well as positive
experiences and results in the past.  My knowledge of HAP is fairly
strong.

My new Windows version of HAP recently arrived, though it remains
uninstalled to date.

However, I increasingly find the HAP clunky for small analysis and find
myself  utilizing simple spreadsheets a lot more these days.

I look forward to the discussions in this list.

Simulators,

The list has grown quickly to about 150 people.  I'd like 
to change the introductory text to indicate that we have 
advanced users of some different simulation programs on the 
list.  So far, it sounds like we have advanced users of:

DOE-2
Transys
Blast

Any advanced users of other building simulation programs?

Also, we haven't had any "frequently" asked questions so 
far, is it premature to start the outline of a FAQ?  What 
are some appropriate topics?  I think it should be aimed at 
newcomers as well as advanced users.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F199903052021.AA215675MD30134@gard.com>

Esteemed Colleagues,
I am compiling information for a market study of the building energy
simulation industry for the California Energy Commission. I am seeking
pre-existing information on:

-market size estimates and projections
-lists and contact info for private, public, and academic sector market
players
-descriptions of current products and estimates of market share
-R&D organizations and current activities
-surveys of existing building simulation users
-surveys of other A/E/C professionals who could be using simulation

I am familiar with DOE's online Tools Directory and LBNL's site. But a few
moments of your expertise in any or all of these areas would be greatly
appreciated.

Thanks!!

-Tom

Mostly, perhaps.  But there are a lot of Macs, too, and Linux is
coming on strong.  And many of us still work on other Unix
workstations out of pure preference.  In the area of residential
design and drafting, for example, Macs are very popular, maybe
even dominant (informal guess based on my wife's experience in
the field---she's one of very few Windows users among local
residential architect/designers).

The point is that it makes little strategic sense to limit
yourself to one OS when you don't have to.  The exercise of
writing cross-platform code also insulates you from whatever
gratuitous changes Microsoft will make in its next OS releases.
Given the technologies available today, I can think of very few
reasons (other than emotional loyalty) to limit software to a
single platform/OS.

All that said, I don't think COM/CORBA is the most serious
question.  If the guts are divorced from the GUI(s) and if the
underlying calculation engine sports a simple, generic,
language-oriented interface, it should be straightforward to
layer on any number of network interface wrappers (COM, CORBA,
simple sockets, etc.).

Back to work...

Subject:	[BLDG-SIM] DOE-2 Tip on ##elseif

BLDG-SIMmers,

Here is a tip when using DOE-2 macro language and the 
##elseif command.  Some versions of DOE-2 will include more 
than one elseif block of code in a if-elseif-elseif-else-
endif structure if the conditions on each elseif are true. 
This is different than most programming languages that will 
only include the block of code in the first elseif that is 
true.  This is a small tip but it would have saved me a few 
hours of effort a year ago.  

Does anyone have any other undocumented tips for building 
simulation programs?

Almost all of the people who provided an opinion wanted the 
name of the mailing list in the subject line.  Most also 
said that allowing the subscribers to get a listing of the 
subscribers was a good idea.  I have changed the 
configuration of the mailing list on both.  To get a 
listing of who is on the mailing list send a message to 
mail-server at gard.com with the message LIST BLDG-SIM.  This 
is an experiment, if people think this is really resulting 
in them getting spammed I will change it back.

If by "Linux-style" you mean "open source software," then yes,
by all means.

If by "Linux-style" you mean "runs under Linux," then yes, but
not just Linux---generally cross-platform.  (COM is not and
probably never will be cross-platform.  CORBA has a much better
chance.)

What is not needed is yet another monolithic, do everything, be
everything simulation "tool."  (EnergyPlus is working that
front??)  We need reusable parts and a simple framework for
connecting them.  Envision a calculation engine running on a
big-iron server with various clients (web-based, CAD-based,
spreadsheet-based, simple Perl script-based, etc.) accessing it
over the net.  Some would use full hourly simulation
capabilities.  Others would just want U-value calculations or
solar angle calcs.

This suggests another thing that is not needed---a GUI.  If the
underlying simulation parts were free of legal encumbrances, any
entrepreneur could build a nice GUI front-end for any
purpose---code compliance, home energy ratings, CAD, job
costing, building diagnostics, commissioning, sales, you name
it.  Early focus on a GUI tends to restrict the possible uses of
the software and tends to lock it into a single platform/OS.
Build the calculation engine in an open process so all can
inspect and improve it and let the market build the various
GUIs.

I could go on and on on this very interesting topic...

the e-mail.  Turns out there are many people who don't bother to put

I certainly wouldn't put them on every email header.  I
wouldn't be opposed to a list member being able to query
the system for a list of subscribers, though.  But others
might object, especially those whose 'net feeds cost them
by the byte or minute.

Hello simulation world!

My name is Jim Kelsey and I am one of the co-founders of KW Energy
Engineering. My partner Kevin Warren and I are both graduates of the
University of Wisconsin Solar Energy Lab. So we've both been up to our ears in
TRNSYS. While I was there I used the TRNSYS building simulation model to
assess the effects of ASHRAE Std 90.1 on commercial buildings. To do it I had
to develop more accurate slab heat loss models and a model to simulate a
water-loop heat pump system.

More recently my simulation experience is with VisualDOE (2.1E) and PowerDOE
(2.2). We just got our copy of PowerDOE & I have spent some time with it but
have not yet tried anything very complex. I can say that it has some pretty
nice features: I like the way that it displays the building in 3D, has a
somewhat customizable front end, and it seems to to live up to the claim that
it has a superset of DOE 2 features. But the BIG FEATURE that I was excited
about - the ability to automate parametric analysis - is not yet implemented.
Also I can confirm reports from the field that it crashes very frequently. In
its defense, so far it has not corrupted any files so you only lose what has
been done since the last save. But it is a big headache that needs to be
solved. So is Jeff Hirsch on this list? Any defense Jeff?

Other simulation experience:
* Energy-10:  I've used this on a project to look at envelope and equipment
selection for a new retreat center in New York State.
* Bin modeling: Scores of bin models for energy audits. I also developed an
automated TC 4.7 method bin model for a utility client to analyze energy
efficiency measures.
* Refrigeration: I developed some spreadsheet models for assessing energy
savings from floating head pressure at a winery, grocery stores, and a cold
storage facility.

Enough shameless self promotion! I'm looking forward to hearing from other
folks on the list.

- Jim

Hi Everyone

This is Bruce Spurlock with Southern Company Services, Inc. in Atlanta.
I have been using Simulation Tools since 1975 using the old "University of
Florida"
program and our in house Bin method program.  I switched to AXCESS
Energy Analysis Tool in 1978 and have been involved with  its upgrade from
version 6.0  through 10.2d which is the current EPRI version.
I have used Doe2.1,  Trnsys, and Doe2.2 (PowerDoe) also.
We are developing an all windows program to do small buildings similar to
AXCESS which will be quick and easy using all the windows functions, but
it can also call Doe2.2  if needed to do a detail simulation.

To: Bldg-Sim-GARD subscribers:
 
Several times each year, ASHRAE posts a list of research projects which are
ready to bid.  Some of these requests for proposal (RFPs) may be of interest
to "bldg-sim" subscribers. I am adding this address to the list of
addressees who receive notifcation when new RFPs are available. If you
receive more than one notification, please excuse the inconvenience.  
 
Below is a copy of the notification which went out about two weeks ago.

 
We now have posted on the ASHRAE Home Page  (www.ashrae.org) , five
requests-for proposal (RFP) which are ready for bid.  There will be numerous
others added to this list shortly after April 1, following the Spring
meeting of the Research Activities Subcommittee.  The deadline for receipt
of responses to all of these RFPs will be May 14, 1999.
 
Please share this announcement with your colleagues who may have an interest
in these or similar projects.
 
If you have no interest in receiving future reminders such as this, please
inform me by return e-mail.

Hello everybody,
	I work at the Solar Energy Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin and
am in charge of developing TRNSYS.  We've been spending a fair amount of
time recently on making it easier to connect TRNSYS to other simulation
programs. Really to merge the strengths of the various tools that are
available.
Cheers,
	David

Welcome Everyone!

About 60 people have subscribed so far to the BLDG-SIM 
mailing list since my announcement yesterday.  To get 
things started I thought I would tell people about my 
background in simulation tools.  

Shelter - A proprietary tool that I helped write in 1988 
for evaluating the mechanical systems for passively cooled 
telecommunications enclosures and small buildings.  Number 
of current users is probably zero - I'm not even sure where 
floppy with the source code is anymore.

DOE-2.1 - The tool of my dreams and nightmares.  I have 
been using it since 2.1c and contributed to the development 
of some of the gas cooling models and the revised economics 
portion.  Especially good in systems, plant, econ and 
macros.  

DOE-2.2 - Have used some but it may end up being my future 
bread and butter tool.  Do we have any frequent users of 
this on the list yet?

ASEAM - Haven't used in years but did use it in a big 
project (programming a prototype ASEAM to DOE-2 translator).

Enough about me, whats everyone elses experience?

Jason
