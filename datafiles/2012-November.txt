You can also look at a state-space model, I developed almost 20 years ago,
that can directly output what you need. The model is now used in a tool
DeST developed by Tsinghua University, China.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Model predictive control and rule extraction applied to
	mixed mode buildings
Message-ID: <8C1E66D4-6E63-4FCF-B758-B76FD339FA9F@xergyconsulting.com>

Hello modeling community,

I am at long last announcing the publication of my dissertation and associated USGBC-funded research that investigates the application of model predictive control to mixed mode buildings, examines the optimality of typical control schemes for these facilities, and explores the use of data mining techniques to automate the extraction of near-optimal control rules from offline model predictive control results (in other words, training simplified decision models to operate a building in a near-optimal manner based on heavy offline computation with detailed EnergyPlus models). Research was conducted with oversight from my advisor, Gregor Henze at the University of Colorado Boulder's Building Systems Program. You may find the work particularly interesting if you have explored the related research of Brian Coffey (also recently posted to this forum).

The results are available through a few publications listed below:
Dissertation, Offline Model Predictive Control of Mixed Mode Buildings for Near-Optimal Supervisory Control Strategy Development. A thorough treatment of both the MPC and rule extraction processes, with experimental validation and associated source code.
USGBC final report, HVAC Control Algorithms for Mixed Mode Buildings. A slightly more accessible report that ignores the rule extraction angle and instead benchmarks existing mixed mode control strategies against MPC. Simplified, near-optimal heuristics are analyzed.
For those with access, you might be interested in the following journal publications: Extraction of supervisory building control rules from model predictive control of windows in a mixed mode building (JBPS, 2012); Model predictive control of mixed mode buildings with rule extraction (Building and Environment, 2011). One more is in the works on experimental validation.

I am more than happy to discuss the work and share associated rule extraction code with interested parties. Hoping this can be of use to some of you.

Best regards,
Peter

Dear IBPSA Board,

 

The IBPSA News Volume 22 No 2 is now available at  <http://www.ibpsa.org>
www.ibpsa.org. It is dedicated in honour of Curtis Pedersen. 

 

Features include: an interview with Jon Wright about IBPSA England's first
conference, an interview with Hugo Hens about the limitations of Heat, Air
and Moisture simulation, and a message from Joe D'Angelo about JBPS' first
impact factor. 

 

A big thank you to all those who have contributed to the News!

 

With respect to your individual bios on the IBPSA website, kindly fill in
the attached form and send it back to me at your earliest convenience. It
should only take you a couple of minutes to do this, however, so far I have
only received 5 in total! Please rename the attached document with your name
and country, e.g. in the case of our president
"Beausoleil-Morrison_Canada_information". (Btw, Ian is one of the few people
who have already submitted it!)

 

Happy reading!

 

Regards,

Christina Hopfe

Editor-in-Chief

Dear All,

The IBPSA-USA Los Angeles national chapter is proud to bring you another
lecture series event in November. It was a pleasure to see great turnout
for our first kick-off event ?Pecha Kucha Night? and we hope the trend
continues.


Details:

*SimBuild 2012 Comes to LA*

Thursday November 19th, 2012, 6pm ? 8pm
Harley Ellis Devereaux?s LA downtown office, 601 South Figueroa Street, Los
Angeles, CA 90017

Ph: 213-271-8914 (Sukreet)



IBPSA-USA held its fifth biennial conference (SimBuild) in Madison,
Wisconsin in August. The event was a great success, and included two and
one-half full days of 15 minute presentations from performance
simulationists from around the globe. We realize not everyone can abandon
their workstation to attend such a conference, so we decided to bring a
glimpse of it to you here locally!


We will be providing an overview of SimBuild, showing a list of the
presentations that were given this year, and then presenting a few of those
presentations live for the audience.


RSVP & Event Page (for more details):


http://www.eventbrite.com/event/4672368179


We would like to further expand our audience and it would be lovely to see
and meet more people in the LA area who are interested in high performance
designs and building simulations. Please sign up for the IBPSA USA/LA
newsletter if you haven?t already done so. You can join our mailing list by
clicking on the link below to get all updates:

Thanks for your support as we continue this mission to improve buildings
through performance-based design!

Without knowing the specifics of which data file you are using, its hard to give a definitive answer. My understanding is that the original set of TMY2 weather files are a series of files that were developed at NREL for 230 or so sites in the US based on something called the Solmet data base. Only 30 sites actually had measured data; the rest were modeled, correlated, statistically processed, etc. The original set of TMY2 data files for those US cities should not, I think, be confused with the use of the TMY2 file format for weather files from other cities. 

As for your other question, there is no particular need to create a file that has the TMY2 format if you don't want to. Type9 is designed to read an interpolate data files. Radiation data read by Type9 can then be passed to Type16 for processing and calculation of radiation falling on other surfaces. This saves you the trouble of having to figure out where to obtain data values for the fields that you don't need in the TMY2 format. Type15 (the weather reader/processor) is really just a combination of Type9 and Type16 glued together internally and given the ability to read a series of standard file formats (TMY, TMY2, TMY3, E+, etc.) 
Kind regards, 
David

Dear All, 

1) 
I have already converted TYM2 data for Poznan (PL-Poznan-Lawica-123300) from text file to excel using: http://sel.me.wisc.edu/trnsys/weather/tmy2data.htm . 
Some of meteorological data, which are there, have additional columns named Flag of Data Source . Dry bulb temperature is one of these data. In my file is written that data source for dry bub temperature is E, and in TYM2 manual ( http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/pubs/tmy2/PDFs/tmy2man.pdf ) I have read that it means: 

Modeled or estimated, except: precipitable water, calculated from 
radiosonde data; dew point temperature calculated from dry bulb 
temperature and relative humidity; and relative humidity 
calculated from dry bulb temperature and dew point temperature 

Could you explain me what it is mean? I expected that temperature is measured? 

2) 
The second issue is that I would like to create my own TYM2 file to run TRNSYS simulation with my own meteorological data. How should I model e.g. illuminance? of maybe I don?t need this value if I use in simulation only: 
? Dry bulb temperature, 
? Effective sky temperature, 
? Humidity, 
? Wind velocity and direction, 
? Atmospheric pressure, 
? Solar zenith and azimuth angle, 
? Total surface radiation, 
? Beam surface radiation, 
? Angle of incidence for surface, 
? Ground reflectance. 

Which data (columns) do I need in TYM2 file to get above values? 

I will be grateful for any tips!!! 
Regards

Hi,

There are few online videos for basic and advanced users on IES forum on 
youtube which you can look at.
http://www.youtube.com/user/iesve?feature=results_main

Alternatively, the harder but more efficient way of going about it would 
be going through the user guides especially Apache HVAC user mannual 
which is pretty much in detail if you are specifically looking for help 
with HVAC.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <002c01cdc0fa$5443aa10$fccafe30$@put.poznan.pl>

Dear All,

 

I simulate the dwelling in TRNSYS. Last time a try to validate my model and
I compare simulation results with measurements.

Heat consumption has been measured in dwelling every week (the same day of
week and the same hour).

Trnsys simulation generate results for dwelling's model with ideal heating
assumptions (set temperature 20/21) -NTYPE2 (sensible energy demand).

 

Total heat consumption (measurements) of dwelling and energy demand
(simulation) of simulated model are quite similar (36 weeks from September
to June), but if we look on weekly results there are bigger difference with
interesting regularity:

 

if heat consumption decreases from one week to the next, then energy demand
increase, and vice versa (I enclose graph).

 

Could you tell me what can cause this lack of coincidence?

I will be grateful for any hints!

Regards,

Karol

Dear Bldg-sim members, 

 

The National Physical Laboratory (www.npl.co.uk) - the UK's National
Measurement Institute, based in London - is holding an event in Building
Performance Evaluation on the 5th of December at ARUP in London as part
of its work under the Centre for Carbon Measurement
<http://www.npl.co.uk/carbon-measurement/>  

 

The purpose of the event is to understand from the evaluation community
some of the measurement challenges faced and work/ research that needs
to be done. This will hopefully provide useful insight in to the
formulation of NPL research projects going forward, making sure what we
do is relevant to and supports the community. It may also provide some
useful opportunities for other collaborations. 

 

More details of the event can be found here: 
http://www.npl.co.uk/events/5-dec-2012-the-building-performance-gap 

 

A snap shot of the agenda can be seen below. 

 

If you can't make the event, please feel free to send me some of your
thoughts on the subject. 'All' input is useful.

Karol,
   The behavior that you describe is certainly contrary to gut sense. 
However, there are any number of reasons why the simulation might be 
showing you these results, ranging from user error to the equipment 
operating at a much less efficient operating point under lower load 
conditions. I would recommend that you check energy balances in your 
simulation and make sure that it is operating the way that you intend 
for it to.
Regards,
  David

FYI.

You should not expect a model to exactly match real data from a real building, unless some very specific things have been done. Unfortunately, residences can sometimes be the worst to calibrate.

The new ASHRAE Guideline 14 will have advice on this, SPC 209 is also looking into this as is the EDF in NYC for multifamily and commercial existing projects to reduce financing uncertainty.

You can find a papers and thesis on our website that discuss efforts by students and faculty in our lab, over the years, for residential and commercial projects, including calibration tools.

Dear All,

I simulate the dwelling in TRNSYS. Last time a try to validate my model and I compare simulation results with measurements.
Heat consumption has been measured in dwelling every week (the same day of week and the same hour).
Trnsys simulation generate results for dwelling?s model with ideal heating assumptions (set temperature 20/21) ?NTYPE2 (sensible energy demand).

Total heat consumption (measurements) of dwelling and energy demand (simulation) of simulated model are quite similar (36 weeks from September to June), but if we look on weekly results there are bigger difference with interesting regularity:

if heat consumption decreases from one week to the next, then energy demand increase, and vice versa (I enclose graph).

Could you tell me what can cause this lack of coincidence?
I will be grateful for any hints!

Karol

Hi,

 

We are proposing to carry out some modelling using future weather data
to assess the effect of future climate change scenarios on overheating
risk for a development in London.

 

Does anyone have experience of using the CIBSE future weather files for
such modelling? I have a few queries I hope someone can help with.

earlier since office is keeping very busy these days. I was wondering if a
phone conversation was possible sometime this weekend or maybe next week.
I'm free during lunch hours or in the evening after 7. I definitely would
be able to connect and explain better this way. Please let me know.

Does 90.1 Minimum Efficiency Requirements include fan energy?, I am referring to table 6.8.A which specifies for air conditioners less that 8.8 kW capacity a minimum COP of 3.52.
Since my building does now have a cooling system I have to use the baseline system (PTAC) and I am not sure if I have to model fans explicitly. 

Kind Regards,

Felipe,

You may find it of interest that one of the options in the Tables that James Dirkes mentioned is to use brake h.p. in place of name plate h.p. for the fan motors.  Using brake h.p. seems to lessen the burden on the designer by allowing numerous power adjustments based on the various items in the air circuit that cause added friction losses ? like MERV filters, sound attenuators, etc.  The adjustments are found in the second table (6.5.3.1.1B).  This is common to both the 2007 and the 2010 versions. 

In addition, you might be interested to look at the proposed Addendum BL (for version 2010) that would require the user to remove fan energy from equipment where the fan energy is included in the energy efficiency rating of the equipment, when using Chapter 11 (ECB Method) and Appendix G.  This addendum includes a methodology for removing the fan energy from packaged equipment efficiency ratings.

Message-ID: <95F0356A0810C44AB56ADD48FA44184101A9290F@greengo>

Dear group, 

 

In our current projects we noticed a big difference when modeling solar
gains between the software IES VE and Designbuilder (EnergyPlus). IES VE
underestimate the values of solar gains, by almost 1 to 2 of difference
than EnergyPlus,

 

So I just try to ask if someone of you are experienced the same
difference and if you know the reasons of that big difference. We test a
"cell-test" and we found also this underestimation of solar gains.

 

Thanks in advance,

 

David Garcia Sanchez

David,

One thing to check is the definition of solar gain in the 2 programs. For example, in DesignBuilder EnergyPlus the solar gain reported is the gross solar gain, including any solar heat that is subsequently re-reflected back out of the windows. I don't know the definition of solar gains in IES VE, but if it displays the net solar gain then this might explain the difference, especially in zones with large areas of glazing where re-reflection is more significant.

Regards,

Andy

David,

I suspect that you are not comparing apples to apples. Intermodel comparisons are generally difficult to complete without a thorough understanding of the inputs and algorithms used in the tools. Its very easy to think you have equivalency in your input models when you do not. You have the added complication in your case that the DesignBuilder interface adds another layer of translation to the problem.

Also note that both simulation engines (IES VE and EnergyPlus) have been through the BESTEST/ASHRAE 140 process as well as many other validation exercises. This should mean that given the same input the output will be similar (within some bound due to different algorithms and implementations).

I suggest that you make a careful comparison of all the inputs and understand how they impact the simulation, then do the same with the output variables that you are comparing.

Regards,

Iain

Message-ID: <20121125221809.11862gigaqncjxnl@webmail.co2engineering.eu>

Dear all,

I am trying to include the cost for electricity and gas in my eQUEST  
model. I have "on-peak", "off-peak" and "normal use" values for summer  
and winter during each day for electricity and one price for gas. How  
do I set the schedule flags? Is it the time when the price changes or  
is it the cost per unit?

Thank you very much in advance.

Best wishes,

Eleni

The wizard has a great tool for defining time-of-use rates. Even if I am in the detailed interface on a project, I will start a new project, create the TOU rate in the wizard, then file import that bit of the .inp file into my original model.

Subject: [Equest-users] Schedule flags

Dear all,

I am trying to include the cost for electricity and gas in my eQUEST  
model. I have "on-peak", "off-peak" and "normal use" values for summer  
and winter during each day for electricity and one price for gas. How  
do I set the schedule flags? Is it the time when the price changes or  
is it the cost per unit?

Thank you very much in advance.

Best wishes,

Eleni

Dear Colleagues,

Apologies for Cross posting.....I wanted to remind you of the BESS SB13 conference ?Advancing Towards Net Zero? that we are organizing in Southern California on the 24th and 25th of June, 2013.  SB13 is part of a major international series of conferences that focuses on sustainable buildings and there will be 16 conferences in 2013, culminating in an international event in 2014 in Barcelona, Spain.  

We are looking for papers in six major topics:  innovative design, improving existing building stock, validation, affordability, user control, and education (more information on the topics in our website).  Papers will be rigorously reviewed by an international panel of leading experts and the top papers will be fast-tracked for inclusion at SB14 in Barcelona. All approved papers will also be included in the ICONDA?CIBlibrary as (free for all) downloadable pdf documents (full proceedings and searchable by papers) and we are also looking into a special edition of an international journal. 

Authors from any country are welcome. We have tried to make the conference very affordable and the registration will include lunches and the keynote dinner. In the interest of promoting a wider and more diverse exchange of ideas we are also providing very reduced registration to students and attendees from developing countries. Detailed registration information is available on our website.  We will be posting hotel information soon but there is a very affordable hotel on site at Cal Poly Pomona and many other hotels close by.

The deadline to submit the papers using our template and through the open conference site is January 21, 2013.

Message-ID: <D1168E6C4207B742BFC631BD652B1E922D15520152@MAILBOX1.nrel.gov>

All,

The DOE Commercial Reference Buildings website has some updates to include files compatible with the most recent version of EnergyPlus (7.2):

http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/commercial/ref_buildings.html

A few other changes were made to the models, as well, as listed here:

http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/publications/pdfs/commercial_initiative/refbldgs_changes_v40tov70.pdf

The only changes between v1.4_7.0 and v1.4_7.2 were transitioning the models to the newer EnergyPlus version (that's why the document only lists "changes_v40tov70").  Also, the models were run in EnergyPlus v7.0, and you can find a table of EUI results here:

http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/publications/pdfs/commercial_initiative/refbldgs_eui_tables_1-4_7-0.pdf

Thanks to those that requested updates - we're glad you find the models useful!

David,

I would caution you not to be so quick to use the term "underestimate," which implies that you are certain that your test is set up correctly and that know the EnergyPlus calcs to be accurate. Furthermore, given the magnitude of the disparity you've described-which does not show up either in the published ASHRAE 140 tests comparing results for the VE and EnergyPlus or in the SimBuild paper from Cassie Waddell and Shruti Kaserekar that Javed Iqbal attached to his reply-there may be something significantly amiss in your comparison.

You need to ensure that you are consistent with your glazing properties and you may want to be running the "detailed solar calculations" in EnergyPlus and, likewise, linking the simulation to results from the SunCast module within the VE if you want a suitably consistent basis for the comparison. This will facilitate calculation of incident solar radiation on specific surfaces, etc.

While I'm not sure how this works in EnergyPlus, when you run simulations coupled to the SunCast module in the VE, you need to be cognizant of the relative placement of glazing in your "test cell," as low-angle direct-beam radiation striking an east window in the early morning, for example, can pass through the space and out the other side, in keeping with the location and solar transmission of glazing on the fa?ades through which the solar gain is entering and exiting.

On a related note, whereas the paper from Waddell and Kaserekar attributes the calculation of interior inter-surface radiant exchanges to the SunCast module of the VE, this is actually a function of the ApacheSim engine used for all dynamic thermal simulations in the VE. SunCast determines which surface the solar gain will fall upon and what fraction of each surface is shaded from direct-beam radiation at any given time step, as well as how much of those surfaces are shaded from the cooling effects of the night sky; however, regardless of SunCast, the hot interior surface of a piece of glass having absorbed solar gain, for example, will always exchange radiant energy with any interior surfaces of lower temperature during the simulation run. Conversely, the cold interior surface of a window or exterior wall in winter will always act as a sink for radiant energy from warmer interior surfaces.

Finally, if you're interested in digging deeper into the comparison, I was told by researchers at the Technical University at Eindhoven in The Netherlands attending the last SimBuild conference that their current findings (yet to be published) show that the solar calculations in the VE are actually somewhat more accurate than those in other tools, including EnergyPlus and ESPr, particularly when passing through multiple glazed surfaces, cavities, or thermal zones. As it's not yet published and IES was not involved in this research, I'll leave it to TU Eindhoven to elaborate on what they tested, what they found, and whether or not they believe this to be of any significance. They may be willing to share some results in advance of publication.

Regards,
Timothy

Dear group,

In our current projects we noticed a big difference when modeling solar gains between the software IES VE and Designbuilder (EnergyPlus). IES VE underestimate the values of solar gains, by almost 1 to 2 of difference than EnergyPlus,

So I just try to ask if someone of you are experienced the same difference and if you know the reasons of that big difference. We test a "cell-test" and we found also this underestimation of solar gains.

Thanks in advance,

Message-ID: <BB47BD04E7AC9E46940B504CC8E76ABE058D19D9@MWEXS2.ENVIRONCORP.INT>

I am having some difficulty setting up multiple HVAC systems serving one zone.
The situation is that I am modeling a building with packaged rooftop units as
well as exhaust fans. However, I can't model the exhaust fans using the exhaust
fan object because the exhaust fans are controlled based on enthalpy
differential with outdoor air (as I understand it, exhaust fan availability
managers only allow temperature differential).

So I thought I would set up another HVAC system in addition to the RTUs that
would function like the exhaust fans (with a supply fan, rather than exhaust, no
heating or cooling coils). I could then use an outside air controller to
specify the enthapy differential control. The issue I am having is setting up
both systems to serve one zone. Do I connect the second system (exhaust
system)to the zone inlet node, or upstream of the zone splitter associated with
the RTUs? Where do I connect downstream of the zone?

Any help would be much appreciated. Of course, if anyone has a way of getting
the exhaust fan object to run on differential enthalpy, I would take suggestions
there too!!

LEED is no more specific than ASHRAE 90.1, which is not very specific on thermal bridges other than those occurring in the assembly (studs, cladding attachments, etc).  It is not specific about thermal bridges such as slabs, shelf angles, parapets, etc.

Aside from LEED, standard linear transmittance values are available for common North American details, as per ASHRAE 1365-RP.  Our company authored the report, which can be found here:

Message-ID: <DUB103-W295A9CD3936B9FFD6BE9FEE05E0@phx.gbl>


Dear building-sim,


 
I'm currently working on a LEED NC sports facility with an underground 
parkade for approximately 200 cars.


 
The parkade exhaust system (100% OA) turns on if the CO2 
levels detected in the parkade exceed a particular threshold. Has anybody modeled such a system? What 
assumptions can be made for the CO2 profile? As it is in a northern climate, I 
do not want to overestimate the usage of the system which would skew the heating 
energy required to heat the OA to the required supply temperature.


 
Your help is greatly appreciated.


 
Thanks

 Outside Air System and Cooling Tower
Message-ID: <CAMdiMCLswKV8gcmSE5PVWO0x25N=g8nKeVbCMv-9TZaGVa5HiA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,
I am working on a LEED Energy model for a 8 floor Office Building. The
Baseline System type I have is Type 8 -VAV with PFP boxes / Chilled
Water-cooling, Electric Heating.

Now, the proposed building has Water cooling unitary units with a single
Outside Air unit. The outside air is supplied to mechanical room on each
floor through a ducted shaft with each floor having its own VAV box to
control the OA. Also, there is one single cooling tower that is used as a
Heat rejection equipment. I am doing this model in TRACE, so all the trace
experts are welcomed to answer this as well.

1. Since i have a Dedicated Outside Air Unit, I should model the outside
air fan for the baseline as well and allow it be sized based on PRM method
? Now, TRACE does not allow me to create a overall Air side system type
Outside air unit and thus i have to basically provide a Optional
Ventilation fan on each unit (i guess this is limitation but i cant think
of other way) for the Baseline.  Also, TRACE only allows 90.1 Fan power
adjustment to Primary fan (Supply fan) so i will not be able to take any
credit for fan power adjustment on Outside air fan for using better filters.
Similarly, for proposed building i have to model the Optional Ventilation
Fan but this would be based on my actual selection. The selection i have is
for Dedicated Outside Air fan. Is it safe to assume the proposed outside
air fan power in "KW/CFM" from the actual selection for the energy
consumption?

2. Similar to point 1, TRACE does not allow to create a single plant as a
heat rejection equipment for all the Indoor units. Thus, based on my
selection for cooling tower , condenser water pump, is it safe to simulate
the proposed building with cooling tower and pump for each water cooled
unitary system with the same KW/TON and Watts/GPM respectively?

Finally, if i do the above mentioned things in simulation, does anyone else
have any experience with this kind of situation for the LEED model. I can
explain everything in Narrative (that these are limitations of Modeling
software), but i am afraid what the LEED reviewer may or may not approve
and if he/she does not approve, would he/she suggest a way of doing it the
right way or not.

Any thoughts, suggestions are greatly appreciated.

Hi Donal,

 

You'll want to control outside air off CO (not CO2) in a parking garage and be sure the controls sequence utilize the correct ppm setpoints.  Generally there is a minimum ventilation/exhaust rate to maintain even when CO levels are in check for code compliance. 

 

For modeling the system, a specific ventilation schedule correlating to expected usage of the car garage has worked for me in the past.  I would imagine similar schedules for this facility have been created for occupancy and lighting/plug loads.

 

Regards,

 

Bob Quitadamo

Subject: [Bldg-sim] How to Model Parkade CO2 Levels for Exhaust Requirements

 

Dear building-sim,

I'm currently working on a LEED NC sports facility with an underground parkade for approximately 200 cars.

The parkade exhaust system (100% OA) turns on if the CO2 levels detected in the parkade exceed a particular threshold. Has anybody modeled such a system? What assumptions can be made for the CO2 profile? As it is in a northern climate, I do not want to overestimate the usage of the system which would skew the heating energy required to heat the OA to the required supply temperature.

Your help is greatly appreciated.

Thanks

Donal

The 90.1 user's manual briefly touches on modeling uninsulated and minor 
uninsulated assemblies; here are some snipets from the section that 
describes modeling for PRM:

/All uninsulated assemblies shall be explicitly modeled. Examples 
include projecting balconies, perimeter edges of intermediate floor 
slabs, concrete floor beams over parking garages.//All//
//uninsulated assemblies shall be separately modeled using a separate 
description of each of these assemblies within the energy simulation 
model, or the area-weighted average U-factor based on separate 
calculation of the U-factor for each of these assemblies. The latter 
approach may only be used for assemblies with similar thermal mass/
...
/Provided that these assemblies are insulated, the method allows any 
envelope assembly that covers less than 5% of the total area of a given 
assembly type (e.g., exterior walls or roofs) to be added to an adjacent 
assembly of the same type with the same orientation and the same thermal 
properties. This is not intended, however to allow framing members in 
walls to be ignored  just because they have an area less than 5%./

There are some graphics that help illustrate the recommendations.

Objet : [Bldg-sim] Multiple HVAC systems serving one zone

 

I am having some difficulty setting up multiple HVAC systems serving one zone. 
The situation is that I am modeling a building with packaged rooftop units as
well as exhaust fans. However, I can't model the exhaust fans using the exhaust
fan object because the exhaust fans are controlled based on enthalpy
differential with outdoor air (as I understand it, exhaust fan availability
managers only allow temperature differential).

So I thought I would set up another HVAC system in addition to the RTUs that
would function like the exhaust fans (with a supply fan, rather than exhaust, no
heating or cooling coils). I could then use an outside air controller to
specify the enthapy differential control. The issue I am having is setting up
both systems to serve one zone. Do I connect the second system (exhaust
system)to the zone inlet node, or upstream of the zone splitter associated with
the RTUs? Where do I connect downstream of the zone?

Any help would be much appreciated. Of course, if anyone has a way of getting
the exhaust fan object to run on differential enthalpy, I would take suggestions
there too!!

Donal,

Yes, the fans are controlled based on CO, not CO2.

You would just create different schedules for the exhaust. The baseline is constant flow during the occupied hours plus 1 hr before and after occupancy to capture people arriving early and leaving late. ASHRAE 62.1 requires 0.75 cfm/ft2 of outside air flow. You'll have to determine what flow rate your local code requires.

For the proposed model, create a new air flow schedule that gets you approximately 80-95% energy savings. There are several reports online that provide these ranges. Look for the ones from building owners or researchers, not manufacturers that claim 98-99% savings. The 80-95% range is based on a number of studies of these systems, as the fans spend most of their time at minimum flow, ~0.15 cfm/ft2. In general, if the building operates many hours you'll be closer to 95%, and 80% if the building operates few hours.

I like to create a profile so I capture demand charges properly rather than a flat average curve. For an office space, you'd have peaks from 7-9, a bump from 12-1 for those people going out to lunch, and another peak from 4-6 as people go home. For a hospital parking garage I just modeled, I had peaks from 11pm - 1am, 7-8am, and 4-6pm to capture shift changes. You'll have to decide what makes sense for your specific project.

Hope that makes sense.

Fred


P.S. CO demand control ventilation will be included in the Baseline model for ASHRAE 90.1-2010 per section  6.4.3.4.5 Enclosed Parking Garage Ventilation. Enjoy the model savings while it lasts!

Hi Donal,

You'll want to control outside air off CO (not CO2) in a parking garage and be sure the controls sequence utilize the correct ppm setpoints.  Generally there is a minimum ventilation/exhaust rate to maintain even when CO levels are in check for code compliance.

For modeling the system, a specific ventilation schedule correlating to expected usage of the car garage has worked for me in the past.  I would imagine similar schedules for this facility have been created for occupancy and lighting/plug loads.

Be prepared to argue your case with the LEED reviewer.  On the past several projects for which I tried to take credit for CO control of garage exhaust fans, the reviewer wanted me to provide a list of newly constructed buildings in my area that had non CO-based control of parking garage ventilation systems.  They want you to prove that it is not common practice in your area.  In the DC area, almost every engineer I know is doing CO control of garage exhaust fans, so we've had to abandon this ECM for all of our LEED projects.  Would love to hear of someone arguing this point successfully, and what tactic they used!

Donal,
We have discussed this previously so I suggest reviewing both the Bldg-Sim and equest-users archives.  I vaguely recalled posts about GBCI pushing back on crediting CO-based control, so I found one and pasted it below.

As for 'while it lasts' - if addendum bm succeeds in rolling Appendix G back to align with 90.1-2004 then it seems like CO-based control of garage fans could be back in play as we simulate to demonstrate 40%-50%-60%-? savings vs. 90.1-2004 baseline.

Please also note that if this is for a LEED project, one of the "default" review comments now for CO-based control of garage fans is that the design professional must demonstrate that this is not a "standard practice" for new base-building projects in the area.  I personally think this is a ridiculous comment, but regardless, be prepared to provide a list of new projects in the area that you've worked on that have not had CO-based control of the parking garage fans, otherwise you might have to include it in both the baseline and proposed models.  I would love to hear how other people have addressed this comment.

Hi Donal,

You'll want to control outside air off CO (not CO2) in a parking garage and be sure the controls sequence utilize the correct ppm setpoints.  Generally there is a minimum ventilation/exhaust rate to maintain even when CO levels are in check for code compliance.

For modeling the system, a specific ventilation schedule correlating to expected usage of the car garage has worked for me in the past.  I would imagine similar schedules for this facility have been created for occupancy and lighting/plug loads.

Regards,

Bob Quitadamo

Subject: [Bldg-sim] How to Model Parkade CO2 Levels for Exhaust Requirements

Dear building-sim,
I'm currently working on a LEED NC sports facility with an underground parkade for approximately 200 cars.
The parkade exhaust system (100% OA) turns on if the CO2 levels detected in the parkade exceed a particular threshold. Has anybody modeled such a system? What assumptions can be made for the CO2 profile? As it is in a northern climate, I do not want to overestimate the usage of the system which would skew the heating energy required to heat the OA to the required supply temperature.
Your help is greatly appreciated.
Thanks
Donal

Donal,We have discussed this previously so I suggest reviewing both the Bldg-Sim and equest-users archives.  I vaguely recalled posts about GBCI pushing back on crediting CO-based control, so I found one and pasted it below. As for ?while it lasts? - if addendum bm succeeds in rolling Appendix G back to align with 90.1-2004 then it seems like CO-based control of garage fans could be back in play as we simulate to demonstrate 40%-50%-60%-? savings vs. 90.1-2004 baseline.

I personally think this is a ridiculous comment, but regardless, be prepared to provide a list of new projects in the area that you've worked on that have not had CO-based control of the parking garage fans, otherwise you might have to include it in both the baseline and proposed models.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] How to Model Parkade CO2 Levels for Exhaust Requirements Donal, Yes, the fans are controlled based on CO, not CO2.  You would just create different schedules for the exhaust. The baseline is constant flow during the occupied hours plus 1 hr before and after occupancy to capture people arriving early and leaving late. ASHRAE 62.1 requires 0.75 cfm/ft2 of outside air flow. You?ll have to determine what flow rate your local code requires.  For the proposed model, create a new air flow schedule that gets you approximately 80-95% energy savings. There are several reports online that provide these ranges. Look for the ones from building owners or researchers, not manufacturers that claim 98-99% savings. The 80-95% range is based on a number of studies of these systems, as the fans spend most of their time at minimum flow, ~0.15 cfm/ft2. In general, if the building operates many hours you?ll be closer to 95%, and 80% if the building operates few hours. I like to create a profile so I capture demand charges properly rather than a flat average curve. For an office space, you?d have peaks from 7-9, a bump from 12-1 for those people going out to lunch, and another peak from 4-6 as people go home. For a hospital parking garage I just modeled, I had peaks from 11pm - 1am, 7-8am, and 4-6pm to capture shift changes. You?ll have to decide what makes sense for your specific project.  Hope that makes sense.  Fred  P.S. CO demand control ventilation will be included in the Baseline model for ASHRAE 90.1-2010 per section  6.4.3.4.5 Enclosed Parking Garage Ventilation. Enjoy the model savings while it lasts!  Fred Betz  PhD., LEED AP

Dear all,

I am using eQUEST for a project in Spain and I have used the weather  
data from the EERE (Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy) website. The  
climate zone described in the weather file doesn't seem to agree with  
the one I calculate according to the ASHRAE 90.1 description for  
International climate zones, based on the precipitation levels. Has  
anyone had any similar problems with weather data outside the US? Any  
suggestions about dealing with this?

Thank you in advance.

Kind regards,

Eleni

All,

The DOE Commercial Reference Buildings website has some updates to include files compatible with the most recent version of EnergyPlus (7.2):

http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/commercial/ref_buildings.html

A few other changes were made to the models, as well, as listed here:

http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/publications/pdfs/commercial_initiative/refbldgs_changes_v40tov70.pdf

The only changes between v1.4_7.0 and v1.4_7.2 were transitioning the models to the newer EnergyPlus version (that's why the document only lists "changes_v40tov70").  Also, the models were run in EnergyPlus v7.0, and you can find a table of EUI results here:

http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/publications/pdfs/commercial_initiative/refbldgs_eui_tables_1-4_7-0.pdf

Thanks to those that requested updates - we're glad you find the models useful!
