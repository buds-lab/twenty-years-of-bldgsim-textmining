Nick,

Our AMY files are supposed to be complete and ready to run in eQuest (and other modeling systems).  If there is anything missing or could be improved, we want to hear about it so we can fix.  It is one of the reasons we have been giving away files early on.  For example James Dirkes?s requested to have the start day in the header be the actual day for that file, so we have coded this and it will be in our next upgrade. The processing on 2010 and 2011 is going well should have at least test AMY files for those ready end of this week (with luck).  When this is done we will have the continuous stream from current conditions back thru recent history to deep history.

Thanks for the question,

Chuck

Chuck I?m curious:

 

Are Weather Analytics? AMY files fully compatible, complete and ?ready-to-run? for users of eQuest 3.64?  Are there any fields of data for that may be incomplete or require post-processing in some fashion?  I feel like I?m hearing mixed-messages on that front?

 

Thanks very much, and don?t hesitate to copy the list in response if you feel the answer would be useful to others =)!

As to James posting on this issue the weather data platform we are just finishing has cleaned up and localized weather input and can deliver a continuously updated stream of recent history and current conditions with direct web services access to any and all data.  In other words, we have the weather data side of the client?s desire all set.  We are very happy to cooperate with any efforts to integrate, assimilate or utilize this in a model or models.  Indeed we are looking for partners here, as we believe this is going to be an increasingly important element in the solution to upgrading existing buildings.  So if anyone wants to take on this part of the problem for Katherine, we will supply the weather data portion for free.

5% is a really tight number we have been forced to work with on come retro commissioning projects in the past, with 10% being the norm on an annual and monthly basis for overall building energy use.  Anything stricter than those numbers is unrealistic (again for the overall building).

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] eQuest - Model verification

 

I know I have less experience calibrating models than some other respondents, but I?ll share my perspectives as well:

 

It is easy to adjust occupancy schedules / lighting loads in eQuest, but it requires the end-user knows the program.  If the end-user is inexperienced with eQuest or any other simulation program, then there is no ?easily modifiable? model you can provide.

 

1)      Even if I manage to put in daily occupant and fan schedules based on actual use, will the model be accurate enough to take me within 1%?

 

With regard to historical modeling, showing any deadband of accuracy to known costs/consumptions is *technically* possible given enough information and time?  That said, falling within 1% of any holistic measure, even on an annual basis, before ?refining the unknowns? would probably happen only by very lucky/happy coincidence.  It?s fair to say that in a relative sense, some buildings operate much more regularly and predictably than others, and for these cases you or a client might reasonably expect a tighter deadband.  Asking what is ?accurate enough? is like asking ?what?s reasonable,? and the answer is that it depends on what info/time you have. There are always ?unknowable? variables that can play a big role in your end-results (example:  what is the actual leakiness of a 35 year old envelope?).

 

2)      We have been asked to remove plug loads (both for consumption purposes and cooling loads).  Will this be too big of an assumption to get any accuracy out of the model in the future?

 

Depends on your building, but for most buildings plug loads are a significant fraction of consumption/internal loads.  

 

3)      How do I modify the weather input file?

 

I saved the attached email from David Reddy for the next time I need to tackle ?actual weather.?  My attempts thus far haven?t been terribly successful, so I have no ?go-to? procedures to share just yet.  I have heard reference from those who appear in the know to macro/VBA-heavy excel spreadsheets which can automate the workflow to one extent or another, but I?ve not yet seen one with my own eyes.  I have yet to hear of any program that can ?easily? incorporate recently recorded weather data.  

 

4)      Are there any other ideas I?m missing that will help us validate a model as an absolute measure of actual building energy consumption?

 

Generally:  the only ?absolute measure of actual building consumption? will be the utility bills.  Something about the 1% number tells me you or your client might be trying to hammer a nail with a screwdriver? Energy models are great for looking to the past to make decisions that acknowledge the unknowns of the future, but if the real goal is to know the actual energy usage on an hourly basis ? why not set up some sub-meters and track them?  While meters/bills measure energy usage and energy models can use that information to make predictions, models don?t determine bills ? it doesn?t work in reverse!

 

PS:  For all the work you might put into calibrating a model with historical weather and other known data, keep perspective that your model will only ever be that accurate for behaviour in that year.  The moment anyone wants  to use this model predictively (for the future), you probably should swap back to TMY weather data and embrace the inherent unknowns.

Weighing in late on this?.

If I get >80% R-squared correlation, I think I?m doing well!  

There are so many unknowns, including the normal situation that the client doesn?t know their own operating schedules, occupancy patterns, or maintenance / calibration procedures?.

Also, a model that is calibrated to actual building use and weather can help to highlight building operation issues.  I have had models which were off from actual operating energy use that I was able to determine how the building was operating inefficiently.

 

In one case, I created a model of an existing building.  For this model, I made an actual count of lighting fixtures and computers.  For most of the year, there were few other electrical loads.  I based on their occupancy and use schedules, I was not quite able to calibrate the electrical energy use.  When I met with the client, I informed him that my model showed somewhat lower electrical use, equivalent to 1/3 of the computers remaining on 24-hours per day.  As it turned out, about 1/3 of the employees DID leave their computers on at all times so that they could log in remotely.

 

... I guess what I'm saying is that maybe the goal is not to get the model within 1% of the building energy use, but get the building within 1% of the model.

Bill summed it up really well, Katherine. Sometimes a client will think a calibrated model must match the real building by an unrealistically high number, like 1%. I really can't imagine an instance when that would be desirable. It certainly would be costly to achieve. 

 

Usually the plan is to use the calibrated model as a tool to examine various energy saving measures/opportunities that the client may be interested in implementing. It is important to remember, in this case that you are looking at the usage between the calibrated model and the ECM model, so the 1% deviation is consistent in both and not a worry.

  Katherine,

   

  The questions I would have for you (or your client) are:

  ?         Is this an existing building, or something in the design phase?

  ?         What is the model going to be used for?

  ?         Is there something magical about the 1% number?

  ?         1% of what? Annual electrical consumption? Annual gas consumption? Both? Monthly electric/gas consumption? Monthly/annual electrical demand?

  ?         Why remove the plug loads? Even if everything else is modeled perfectly, plug loads are typically 10% or more of annual electrical consumption but can be all over the place.

  ?         ?Easily adjusted? by whom? Does your client want you to hand them a model and let them make all subsequent adjustments?

   

  Even if you are an expert energy modeler, and there is monitored energy data available for the building down to the individual electrical panels or broken out by end use (lighting, plug loads, individual HVAC units etc.) you will be hard-pressed to get to within 1% on a month-by-month basis. Even 5% month-by-month is difficult. Sure, you can tweak to your heart?s content to get a model to match annual electric consumption within 1% based on prior year?s utility bills but to maintain a calibrated model to that tolerance after that would require a lot of work.

   

  I suggest searching the bldg-sim and equest-users archives for information about weather files.

   

  Oh, one more question ? how much money does your client have?

  Bill

  Hi All,

  Our client would like us to produce an eQuest model that

  a)      Can be easily adjusted to include current and recently recorded weather data

  b)      Can be easily adjusted to reflect space occupancies and lighting loads

  c)       Will reflect the actual building energy usage to within 1%

  Do any of you have experience trying to validate models like this?  

  My concern is that models are approximations, and will not account for small changes in occupancy, outdoor weather, etc.  

  I guess my questions are these:

  1)      Even if I manage to put in daily occupant and fan schedules based on actual use, will the model be accurate enough to take me within 1%?

  2)      We have been asked to remove plug loads (both for consumption purposes and cooling loads).  Will this be too big of an assumption to get any accuracy out of the model in the future?

Hi All,

I am working on a design for a small medical facility (about 1500 sqft).  My
next step is to set up the code compliant baseline by a performance rating
method, but I am questioning what the best source of this code compliant
baseline would be.

I had originally intended to use Appendix G - ASHRAE 90.1 2007 code
compliant baseline requirements....but I am wondering if there is a more
suitable source for medical facilities.  I am aware of ASHRAE's Advanced
Energy Design Guide for Small Hospitals and Healthcare Facilities, but this
does not include code compliant requirements for a performance rating
system.

Any help would be great!  Thanks in advance for your help.

Patrick,
For a code baseline modeling protocol you have at least four choices:

1)      ASHRAE 90.1-2007 Performance Rating Method (PRM) in Appendix G

2)      ASHRAE 90.1-2007 Energy Cost Budget Method (ECB) in Ch. 11.

3)      2009 International Energy Conservation Code Section 506

4)      State energy code such as California's Title 24
Arguably the PRM is the only one written specifically for the purpose of determining how much better a design performs than the standard.
The AIA Guidelines for Design and Construction of Health Care Facilities is an incredibly important reference, especially the table of design flow and minimum flow criteria.
Good luck,

Dear all,

For a research project I am planing to collect some indoor environment data's like air temp, air velocity, relative humidity etc
along with questionnaire survey to know about occupants feelings. I want to know about survey methodologies, sampling methodologies
which are equally important for statistical analysis of collected survey data's.

Can any body share his/her experience about sampling criterion, sampling methodology, analysis tools etc?.
Your efforts are highly appreciated.


Thanks

The following is from the CBECS main web page located at:

http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cbecs/

This is bad news to the modeling community.

Jason


===========================================

                 CBECS Status

EIA regrets to report that the 2007 Commercial Buildings 
Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) has not yielded valid 
statistical estimates of building counts, energy 
characteristics, consumption, and expenditures.  Because the 
data do not meet EIA standards for quality, credible energy 
information, neither data tables nor a public use file will 
be released.  In the interim, EIA will develop key energy 
indicators for commercial buildings in collaboration with 
EIA?s forecasting staff for the Annual Energy Outlook.

Factors contributing to this outcome include the use of a 
cheaper but experimental survey frame and sampling method by 
EIA?s prime contractor, design errors in the construction of 
the method and selection of common building types, and an 
inability to monitor and manage its use in a production 
survey environment.  EIA has reviewed and introduced 
significant changes in its procurement and project 
management standards that will prevent this type of loss in 
the future.

As reported in the EIA Press Release, "Immediate Reductions 
in EIA's Energy Data and Analysis Programs Necessitated by 
FY 2011 Funding Cut" 
(http://www.eia.gov/pressroom/releases/press362.cfm), work 
on the 2011 CBECS has been suspended at this time.

I would also suggest looking at the EPA's Building Assessment Survey and Evaluation (BASE) Study. The study was conducted few years ago following a standardized protocols over hundreds of buildings in the US (I am not sure if they followed ASHRAE PMP or if they are the similar).
http://www.epa.gov/iaq/base/

You can also look at the work done at PennState by Vladimir Vukovic and Jelena Srebric, following BASE protocols in a LEED Gold building in Pennsylvania:

Yes, this is very bad news. So are we stuck with 2003 CBECS for the 
foreseeable future?   I was hoping that EIA would be expanding CBECS, 
not eliminating it altogether!

I found this thread on the Bldg-sim archive - has anything changed with
regard eQuest's ability to adequately model VRF systems? 

 

We have a project that was simulated with HAP, and has now changed to
VRF. Has anyone successfully simulated VRF in HAP?

________________________________

All,
 
Steve Gates is working with Daiken to develop the algorithms and data 
necessary to be able to model VRFs in eQUEST. He is also developing a 
new eQUEST platform simultaneously and more slowly called the Design Day

platform which will solve many of the perceived "problems" with eQUEST 
subroutines. I do not know when the DD platform will be available but I 
don't think it will slow him up with respect to developing the VRF 
algorithms. They will be added to the existing eQUEST platform. These 
algorithms will be available some time early to mid next year.
 
The EnergyPro algorithms are based on MSA data and were developed by 
Tianzen Hong for Martin Dodd. I do not know if there is enough of a 
difference between MSA VRFs and Daiken VRFs operation/data that would 
make the EnergyPro tool inappropriate for use in analyzing the Daiken 
VRFs. Someone else could answer this question. Maybe the Daiken rep 
quoted here knows enough about it and using EnergyPro is quite
appropriate.
 
Regards,
Carol Gardner

DFDD systems

 

Came across this article on the efficient use of a dual fan dual duct system (DFDD). 

Is this an isolated case, or do others propose DFDD systems as an EEM on projects?

I'm sorry, I don't have personal experience with pigs and/or lipstick, so I can't respond to that comment.
 
OTOH, in my experience, changing keywords and/or their order usually do help to get more results with Internet search engines. That's how this reference (among many) came out.

Mais Oui!! Not too many pigs in Montreal, I would think, but if there were I
would expect them to be wearing lipstick as they would be very cosmopolitan
pigs.

Have you read all of the information available in the DOE2 manuals about
dual duct systems? I do remember there being quite a bit of info available
about modeling them in which I believe there was also some discussion about
why they had such a bad reputation. It's called a DDS in DOE2/eQUEST.

See you in June!

Hello All,

Has anyone on this list taken credit for / seen a judgment about credit for feed-in tariffs for onsite PV or any other renewables?  If you are able to sell PV-produced electricity at a rate other than that at which you purchase electricity, does this count in your LEED EAc1 calculation?

Thanks
Corinne

Dear Corinne,

Any power sold to the grid is not eligible under EAc1 (see p.291 of the 
reference guide). Therefore, the feed-in tariff is irrelevant. The power 
exported to the grid, whether there is a feed-in tariff or not, will not 
be counted under this credit.

Or would it be acceptable to use either Riyadh (nearest available on

Message-ID: <BANLkTikkqC6nvv-_c2P+mS5sYrhTOW5bCg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Friends,

I am Srishti Srivastava from India. My research topic is related to
evaluation of different types of facades in Indian context with
special reference to the modern glazed facades.

I am trying to simulate a building with curtain wall in Energy Plus. I
know of one way of doing it through Window and Therm software from
LBNL, although there are few issues in that. Is there any alternative
way to simulate curtain wall in Energy Plus.

Does anyone have a prior experience of simulating curtain wall in
Energy Plus. Can anyone help me in simulating a curtain wall in Energy
Plus.

Thanks in advance.

Srishti Srivastava,
India.

Srishti,
I have no experience of the Therm/ LBNL Window link that you speak of 
but as long as you're happy with working within the limitations of the 
E+ shading calculation you should be fine. I'm not sure of the latest E+ 
but the main historical limitation I'm aware of is that solar gain to a 
zone is absorbed by the floor (with some specific exceptions). This is 
expedient for most simulation tasks but will not suffice if you wish to 
model solar penetrating through subsequent zones (within a double sheet 
facade, where the cavity is modelled as a zone for example). The E+ 
documentation is extensive and covers this in detail.
There are a number of options for the type of solar calc undertaken. 
There are also options for convection coefficient. You may find both of 
these affect results and simulation time.
Good luck
Chris

Srishti,

  Try to found a topic named "Double Facades" on bldg-sim list. I asked the
same question some time ago.  The major problem in this cases ,is the heat
loss by convection inside de facade, because otherwise it will percfectly
work as a thin zone.

 I found something on google, someone asking for an energyplus's developer:

*I'm simulating an office with a double skin fa?ade using the "exterior
vented natural cavity."  *
*The fa?ade is naturally ventilated and has Venetian blinds in the gap. The
blinds are exposed to solar *
*radiation and, during the day, they can reach very high temperatures which
may affect the temperature of the air in the gap and/or the performance of
the glass fa?ade. Does EnergyPlus take into *
*account these two effects? *
*Answer *
*The exterior vented natural cavity model is for *opaque* surfaces only and
does not apply to glazing *
*systems. There is a model for blinds in the window gap that takes those two
things into account, but I *
*am not sure if it works together with the air flow window model.*
*
*
Please let me know if you do some progress. I'm from Brazil and our climate
conditions are very similar.

Good Luck,

Francisco Massucci

Srishti,

  Here is the entire text. My ctrl+C, Ctrl+v failed last time, sorry.

*SIMULATING DOUBLE SKIN FACADE*

I'm simulating an office with a double skin fa?ade using the "exterior
vented natural cavity."
The fa?ade is naturally ventilated and has Venetian blinds in the gap. The
blinds are exposed to solar
radiation and, during the day, they can reach very high temperatures which
may affect the temperature of the air in the gap and/or the performance of
the glass fa?ade. Does EnergyPlus take into
account these two effects?

*Answer*
The exterior vented natural cavity model is for *opaque* surfaces only and
does not apply to glazing
systems. There is a model for blinds in the window gap that takes those two
things into account, but I
am not sure if it works together with the air flow window model.

*Question*
Thanks for your answer. I compared two simulations, one with the fa?ade as
exterior vented cavity
and the other with the fa?ade as a simple window, and it seemed that solar
transmission through the
glazing system is the same in both the cases. Even if the exterior vented
cavity is only for opaque
surfaces do you think it is possible to use the model for a glass fa?ade,
using as input the data of the
glazing system  (thermal emissivity and solar absorbtivity)? Which
differences or errors would occur
using that model?

*Answer *
If I understand you correctly, I think what you are actually getting in the
model is a regular window
surrounded by a wall with a double skin. See if the inside face wall surface
temperatures are different.
The window shouldn't be changing.
The exterior vented cavity model, which assumes that all the solar is
blocked by a thin, solid layer on
the outside, cannot be used for glazing. Opaque means no transmission.
Inside EnergyPlus this
becomes a special boundary condition for surface heat transfer modeling that
is not available for
window modeling. The window still gets exterior environment boundary
conditions even though its
parent surface has the exterior cavity boundary condition.
Double fa?ade improvements are being planned for the future.

*Possible Workaround *
if you really wanted to use the exterior vented cavity model on your DF, it
could apply to a case where
the double fa?ade has totally opaque shades that are closed tight. You would
use regular materials in
the construction for the surface that approximate the DF (no subsurface and
no glazing materials).
The baffle in the exterior cavity model can get quite hot and then
re-radiate infrared (but no
shortwave) and convect to the underlying surface. But note that air gap
models are much better
developed for windows than for regular constructions; you would have to come
up with thermal
properties for each layer. One advantage of this approach might be a better
model of transient
behavior because the window models are always steady state.

the Politecnico di
Milano (Italy) gave a lecture at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory on
how he used EnergyPlus to
model Ventilated Opaque Fa?ades.  A .pdf of his presentation is available

Hello everyone.

Chris,

That limitation isn't present anymore. Solar radiation is partially 
absorbed by the interzone ceilling and floor (and eventually walls if 
present) but calculation is carried out to transmit the remaining 
diffuse and direct radiation into the subsequent zone. Reflections are 
also taken into account. But limitations still persist about shading 
devices:
1) they cannot be specificied to occupy just a fraction of the glazing 
area (fully deployed or no shading at all);
2) they can only be mounted on windows of exterior walls (though this 
allows to model the shading device before, after and in between double 
glazed windows of the exterior pane, it can't be be modeled for shading 
devices on the inner pane, room side;
3) there is still some limitations regarding airflow and convection 
coefficient control between the shading device and the glazing itself, 
because Eplus considers the shading device as a layer of the window it 
is mounted on, and no direct control can be done for that in-between 
window/shade air gap (this also prevents output results for the interior 
window surface of the outside pane, only outside surface temperature and 
shading temperature can be obtained).

Srishti,

So like it has been said, if you plan on simulating ventend facades in 
which the inside pane is opaque, you can model them using the Exterior 
Natural Vented Cavity object present in Eplus. If not, my advice is to 
setup your facade as a vertical stack of two or more zones divided by 
virtual partitions. Using Airflow Network objects, you can define all 
the air dampers you need on the outside pane and also the ventilation 
that occurs across the virtual partitions. Use Full Interior and 
Exterior Solar Distribution with Reflections (remember to keep your zone 
convex), choose a proper inside convection algorithm for the cavity (I 
suggest ISO 15099 Windows), and you should come across some relatively 
close results, considering the complexity of the problem itself.

Pedro.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Ground Temperature Input
Message-ID: <414155.11674.qm@web95903.mail.in.yahoo.com>

Hello,I am doing work on an unconditioned model for a Hot and Dry Climate by using EnergyPlus Sofftware and I need to input the Ground Temperatures values in the object: "Site:GroundTemperatures:BuildingSurface". Earlier I used the Utility: Slab method to calculate these temperatures but that was for a conditioned model.I also used this method for the unconditioned model, but the resulting temperatures were very high in the months of may to august (above 30deg. C). Also, a warning massage had appeared ?that "Site:GroundTemperature:BuildingSurface: Some values fall outside the range of 15-25C".My questions are:1. Is it is correct to use this method (Utility:Slab) for the calculation of Ground temperatures for an Unconditioned model? Can I use the default values (18deg. C for every month by EnergyPlus) only for the unconditioned model?2. As the climate is a Hot and Dry Climate, so the ground temperatures will be high then what is the significance of this
 warning?
Thank You

Hello All,

I would appreciate if anyone could outline the method to model radiant
heating and cooling in eQuest.
I have a DOAS for ventilation and humidification.

Hi Varun,

It would be good for you to search the archives (onebuilding.org) and read
all you can about passive and active chilled beams, radiant systems, and
DOAS. There is a lot of information in the archives about modeling
techniques and issues.

One you have tried to incorporate what you have learned and are building
your model you will undoubtedly have more questions, but they will be more
specific and easier for people to answer.

Best wishes,

Carol

Hi Pedro,

Thanks for this - it's good to be up to date with the latest E+ 
developments and this is a significant one.

I'm not certain Srishti was asking about ventilated facades in the first 
instance. I just threw it in there in my first response and the thread 
has seemed to grow into a "ventilated facades" discussion!

Best regards

Chris

Hello list,

 

I am doing a research for green-roofs analyzed with energyplus. Although I
have searched the internet for default or average values for LAI per plant
or per group of plants, I had no luck. 

 

Can you please give me some guidance or some links about this value???

 

Thank you in advance

I've been wanting to find a resource/chart like you're describing for
some time...  

 

This "guidebook" is pretty nice and something I'm keeping in my
reference files, but doesn't contain the specific info you're looking
for - you might find parts of it handy though:

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Leaf area index values for roof vegetation

 

Hello list,

 

I am doing a research for green-roofs analyzed with energyplus. Although
I have searched the internet for default or average values for LAI per
plant or per group of plants, I had no luck. 

 

Can you please give me some guidance or some links about this value???

 

Thank you in advance

Hi Sotiris,

Well, it is very difficult to work out an averaged LAI for a rooftop garden,
especially for an intensive one. In general, it ranges from 1 to 6 or
7 depends on the species of plants. But for extensive rooftop, most likely
its LAI will be at low end (around 1 to 2, sometimes can be <1) due to
relatively sparse planting. It so happens that I've done my research in the
area. You may be interested in my PhD thesis at
http://scholarbank.nus.edu.sg/handle/10635/15511. We have done a field
measurement in an intensive rooftop garden and you are able to find some LAI
values at page 307 to 313.

Cheney

Sotiris,

LAI values can range from 0(no plants) to 5 or higher. However, typical LAI values for extensive green roofs (substrate/soil thickness less than 6") are around 1-3. For my PhD Thesis at PennState I measured among other things the LAI of a healthy green roof sample with Delosperma nubigenum. The LAI was 2.7.


Hope this helps,

Hi Cheney,

Happy to hear you also worked on this area. We were working on green roofs, but perhaps not same research methodology/ scope. I am not doing green roof at this time but I did it couple of years ago while I was doing my PhD at PennState working under supervision of Dr. Jelena Srebric and did all my experimental work inside an full-scale environmental chamber. In that way I was able to control environmental conditions such as radiation, air temp/RH/speed. Moreover, I measured simultaneously conduction, radiation (short and long wave), convection and evapotranspiration, as well as water content of substrate, LAI, plants and substrate temperature.  It was a very detailed work probably beyond the scope of Sotiris' initial question and I had to design and built a new apparatus to measure all these heat fluxes.  I would be glad to talk more in detail, but perhaps we are going little bit beyond the scope of this mail list.

So our studies might be similar but not precisely the same. We wanted to have a fully validated green roof model (based on physics principles), and back on those days we could not find the type/quality of experimental data to do this job so we produced this laboratory-grade data.


Greetings!

Paulo

Thanks to all,

I would like to clarify the approach i have taken in the study at this
point of time.

The Building which is modelled is a sqaure block. There are five zones
(four aligned in the cardinal directions and one in the centre), the
depth of the zone is till 15 feet from the facade in each cardinal
direction.

Firstly, I am considering a glazed facade here,  which might be either
monolithic(one layer of glass) or Insulated Glazed Units (Double
layers of glass 6 mm thick with an air gap of 12 mm sandwitched
between them ). It is not a load bearing structure.There is no
insulation separately used in the facade.

Secondly, the glass is attached to the subframe which is subsequently
attached to the main frame(both of which are aluminium). Or it can be
directly attached to main frame.

In short, the facade which needs to be simulated is not an opaque
construction. Infact, it is fully glazed since i m considering a
window wall ratio as high as 90 percent also as one of the variables
in the study.

Thus, the question remains to be the same.
How to model curtain wall or rather curtain glazed facades in Eplus?
How will the modelling for such type of facade be different from
modelling a regular window?

I really appreciate the time spent and effort made by people reading
and replying to the thread.

Srishti.

Srishti,

This is nothing out of the ordinary. Just use E+ standard fenestration 
objects.

You're using Window. My approach would be to build up my glazing in 
Window, check it's performance and then manually transfer its 
performance data to the objects WindowMaterial:Glazing, 
WindowMaterial:Gas & Construction. There does appear to be an option to 
link with Window via Construction:WindowDataFile. I have not tried this yet.

Best of luck

Chris

Sotiris asked the same question in Eplus mailing list, and someone 
posted this link. I'll just post it here as well to share it with the rest.

Chris,

I have tried the option to link with Window via Construction:WindowDataFile,
it works fine with the windows with frame and glass but with curtain glazing
there are problems in modeling the window in therm and importing it in
energy plus(This is the reason why i was asking to directly model it in
Energy Plus in my first mail itself.)

Thanks for the other suggestion of doing it in window and manually
transferring the values into Energy Plus model, I will try that out and get
back soon.

Thanks Again,
Srishti.
India.

Hi Srishtri,

I suggest looking at the WindowProperty:FrameAndDivider and
FenestrationSurface:Detailed topics in the Eplus input/output reference
documentation. You can find an example of these inputs in the file
AirflowNetwork_MultiZone_SmallOffice.idf.

ENERGY AND CLIMATE CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION ENGINEER

Transsolar is a German-based climate engineering firm, and one of the 
premier such offices in the world. We are seeking talented, highly 
motivated engineers for our New York office.

Transsolar develops and validate concepts for high quality environments 
that require minimal energy use. To achieve this we work collaboratively 
within the design team from the start of the design process, considering 
each step from the standpoint of fundamental thermodynamics. This 
generates a climate concept in which form, material, and mechanical 
systems are synergistic components of a well-orchestrated climate 
control system; and conversely, an environmental control strategy that 
is integral to the architectural concept.

We use a wide variety of complex computer simulation tools to evaluate 
our concepts, developing unique analytical methods based on a deep 
understanding of engineering physics. We perform dynamic thermal 
simulation using TRNSYS to develop and validate appropriate, reliable 
concepts in relationship to the complex set of factors that is unique to 
each project. Similarly, we perform daylight simulations using RADIANCE 
and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) using FLUENT.

Transsolar engineers are often specialized in their work, but all carry 
out a broad range of tasks. Responsibilities for this position include:
  - Development of climate and energy concepts in response to local 
climate, site, architectural, and programmatic requirements
  - Development, testing and validation of concepts via TRNSYS
  - Engineering analysis via EES, hand calculation, spreadsheet 
analysis, and other engineering analysis tools
  - Programming of new simulation and analysis tools in TRNSYS, EES, and 
spreadsheets
  - Internal coordination with other simulation specialists, synthesis, 
and communication of overall analysis results
  - Graphical representation of climate concepts and complex engineering 
analysis
  - Writing reports and correspondence
  - Participation in meetings and design charettes
  - Collaboration with German Transsolar offices
  - Domestic and international travel to project meetings and sites

Engineers with an emphasis on dynamic thermal simulation are our highest 
priority.   Both entry-level positions and positions for 3-5 years 
experience are available.  Our New York office is small but growing, 
providing ample opportunity for advancement.

PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS INCLUDE:
  - Engineering or applied science education related to building energy 
flows and building science: heat transfer, thermodynamics, fluid 
mechanics, indoor and outdoor human comfort, etc. Ideal is a degree in 
mechanical engineering or applied physics. An M.S. is strongly preferred.
  - Experience with computational engineering analysis (text-based 
input, computer programming, scripting such as Perl, spreadsheet 
analysis and macro programming such as VBA)
  - Experience with dynamic thermal simulation (energy simulation)
  - Proven ability to creatively develop and apply non-traditional 
climate solutions to the indoor environment
  - Education/professional experience with current and advanced 
architectural technologies (e.g. building envelope) and mechanical 
systems for building climate control
  - Experience with physical testing of engineering systems: system 
construction, instrumentation and measurement, etc.
  - Experience collaborating and communicating in the early stages of an 
architectural design process
  - Excellent oral and written communication skills
  - Computer-based drawing skills (e.g. Corel Draw, Adobe Illustrator, etc)

Applicants with an architectural background will not be considered; an 
engineering- or science-based degree is required for this position.
Interested applicants may submit their resume and cover letter via email 
to nycjobs at transsolar.com

Message-ID: <003201cc10f9$68b5d570$3a218050$@com>

Greetings everyone,

 

I have a question regarding the cost of an energy model for a LEED project.
Every energy model I've done so far has been for 

existing buildings, mainly for optimization purposes. However, I received an
RFP to model a five-story, 41,500 sq. ft. building

that's currently on the design phase and is pursuing the LEED-NC Silver
certification. I really have no idea what would be a fair 

price for this model since I'm going to have to use Appendix G (ASHRAE 90.1)
to evaluate the difference between the base 

and proposed buildings. I don't know how much extra effort this will take. I
know the procedure, just haven't done it before.

 

Can you shed any light on this issue?

 

Thanks in advance!

Omar,

I would expect, for a building this size, approximately 40 hours (multiply by your hourly rate). The 40 hours include EAp2/EAc1 LEED documentation, and any review you may have to respond to later.

Now, given that you have never done a LEED model, it will take you more time, possibly up to 40 more hours.

HTH,

I would be careful of only assuming an extra 40 hours to model the baseline
model (Appendix G) and complete the LEED documentation. Assembling the
documentation for the multiple rotations and comparing the proposed design
isn't a simple quick task. I would schedule somewhere in the 64-80 hour
range to model the baseline and complete the documentation, possibly more if
they expect you to model more than once (at different stages of design/etc).

Omar,

 

I agree with this assessment. I usually consider up to two weeks of work for a skilled modeler to complete the simulation and documentation, assuming all the relevant information is readily available, and that you won't have to correct/update the model as the project goes.

 

Though it depends more on the project complexity, re: envelope and HVAC systems, and less on project size.  A cubic building with 20 times the same HVAC system is simpler to model than a multi-wing building with variable fenestration ratios and 20 different HVAC systems.

Omar,

 

I would expect, for a building this size, approximately 40 hours (multiply by your hourly rate). The 40 hours include EAp2/EAc1 LEED documentation, and any review you may have to respond to later.

 

Now, given that you have never done a LEED model, it will take you more time, possibly up to 40 more hours.

 

HTH,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Energy Model Cost

 

Greetings everyone,

 

I have a question regarding the cost of an energy model for a LEED project. Every energy model I've done so far has been for 

existing buildings, mainly for optimization purposes. However, I received an RFP to model a five-story, 41,500 sq. ft. building

that's currently on the design phase and is pursuing the LEED-NC Silver certification. I really have no idea what would be a fair 

price for this model since I'm going to have to use Appendix G (ASHRAE 90.1) to evaluate the difference between the base 

and proposed buildings. I don't know how much extra effort this will take. I know the procedure, just haven't done it before.

 

Can you shed any light on this issue?

 

Thanks in advance!

I agree with this assessment. I usually consider up to two weeks of work for a skilled modeler to complete the simulation and documentation, assuming all the relevant information is readily available, and that you won't have to correct/update the model as the project goes.

 

Though it depends more on the project complexity, re: envelope and HVAC systems, and less on project size.  A cubic building with 20 times the same HVAC system is simpler to model than a multi-wing building with variable fenestration ratios and 20 different HVAC systems.

Omar,

 

I would expect, for a building this size, approximately 40 hours (multiply by your hourly rate). The 40 hours include EAp2/EAc1 LEED documentation, and any review you may have to respond to later.

 

Now, given that you have never done a LEED model, it will take you more time, possibly up to 40 more hours.

Greetings everyone,

 

I have a question regarding the cost of an energy model for a LEED project. Every energy model I've done so far has been for 

existing buildings, mainly for optimization purposes. However, I received an RFP to model a five-story, 41,500 sq. ft. building

that's currently on the design phase and is pursuing the LEED-NC Silver certification. I really have no idea what would be a fair 

price for this model since I'm going to have to use Appendix G (ASHRAE 90.1) to evaluate the difference between the base 

and proposed buildings. I don't know how much extra effort this will take. I know the procedure, just haven't done it before.

 

Can you shed any light on this issue?

 

Thanks in advance!

Omar,
I would recommend that you add some additional time to respond to GBCI comments after submitting the EAc1 documentation, too. Often they will ask for changes to the model and a written narrative to answer their concerns. You may want to budget several days to do this (or list it as an hourly service) if this project is complex.

Best,

Dear Omar,

 

My opinion is that you?ve done the harder project already ? an existing
building!

For a LEED certification you often have more freedom in certain areas, such
as occupancy and equipment schedules because all schedules do not need to be
precise ? they?re just someone?s best estimate.  In an existing building
model, you must get fairly precise so that your model matches the utility
bills.

For LEED, you have:

?         One geometry description (length, width, height, windows)

?         One set of schedules for occupancy and diversity

?         One set of information about ?process? equipment

?         2 sets of materials (Walls, Roof, windows for Baseline per 90.1
and actual)

?         2 sets of HVAC equipment (Baseline and actual)

o   Carefully consider zoning before you begin and review the requirements
for Baseline systems in 90.1.  You may have more than one system type,
especially if some areas of the building have significantly different
schedules or other criteria.

?         2 reports (generally ?ABUPS? is needed for each model) which
describe the key differences between the systems and their performance

o   Including performance in sub-categories such as ?lights?, ?cooling?,
?heating? as described in the LEED documentation

?         1 comparison of the 2 systems which results in an overall
operating cost comparison.

?         Some time with LEED online to load all of your reports

?         Possible time to discuss and explain results with the LEED
reviewer

 

I normally exclude from my scope the documentation of all of the mandatory
requirements in Sections 5-10 of 90.1.  These are normally much easier to
document if you are the designer, since the information is readily at hand
and, presumably, you have incorporated them purposefully during the design
process.  I also state that we do NOT guarantee any LEED points whatsoever;
that?s the designer?s option.  The modeler is only documenting estimated
performance what has been designed, not guaranteeing its performance.
Finally, we also state that the performance is estimated, not necessarily
even close to what will actually occur.  I show some typical language below.

 

As you can see, I?m not saying ?40 hours?.  Rather, compare what you know
about the cost for an existing building to the items which are different in
a LEED certification for a new building, make an estimate using that
information.  I hope that is helpful!

 

1.    Energy models are not intended or expected to match closely with
actual energy use.  They ARE expected to provide a reasonable basis from
which to judge overall patterns and enable comparison of design options.   
New buildings, especially, represent challenges which are not precisely
quantifiable by an energy model.  These include:

?         Patterns of occupancy and lighting use are not established

?         Equipment, including office PCs and copiers, has not been
installed and it is not known how much power will be used nor how often.

?         Weather patterns vary from year to year, while the energy model
uses a ?typical? weather pattern.

?         Equipment efficiencies, control sequences and controls calibration
normally vary from planned, design information.

Omar,

 

I agree with this assessment. I usually consider up to two weeks of work for a skilled modeler to complete the simulation and documentation, assuming all the relevant information is readily available, and that you won't have to correct/update the model as the project goes.

 

Though it depends more on the project complexity, re: envelope and HVAC systems, and less on project size.  A cubic building with 20 times the same HVAC system is simpler to model than a multi-wing building with variable fenestration ratios and 20 different HVAC systems.

Omar,

 

I would expect, for a building this size, approximately 40 hours (multiply by your hourly rate). The 40 hours include EAp2/EAc1 LEED documentation, and any review you may have to respond to later.

 

Now, given that you have never done a LEED model, it will take you more time, possibly up to 40 more hours.

 

HTH,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Energy Model Cost

 

Greetings everyone,

 

I have a question regarding the cost of an energy model for a LEED project. Every energy model I've done so far has been for 

existing buildings, mainly for optimization purposes. However, I received an RFP to model a five-story, 41,500 sq. ft. building

that's currently on the design phase and is pursuing the LEED-NC Silver certification. I really have no idea what would be a fair 

price for this model since I'm going to have to use Appendix G (ASHRAE 90.1) to evaluate the difference between the base 

and proposed buildings. I don't know how much extra effort this will take. I know the procedure, just haven't done it before.

 

Can you shed any light on this issue?

 

Thanks in advance!

Dear Omar,

If you are providing both energy modeling and functioning as building
performance advisor providing design assistance, be sure to factor in effort
for each project phase.

*Schematic Design*
Sketch Models to evaluate form, massing, orientation, architectural
alternates. Here you are either comparing a simplified baseline to
simplified proposed designs, or you are comparing multiple proposed designs
with each other. Be clear on the metric of performance per project goals.
Energy use or cost or carbon, etc. This will depend on whether energy is
purchased or generated on site.

*Design Development*
Your first round of Performance Rating Method models, one baseline and one
proposed model. Some design decisions will have been made by the design team
but a number of assumptions will still need to be made. The purpose of this
round of modeling is to benchmark the project against project LEED targets,
e.g. "are we still good for Silver, or are we down to Certified".

*LEED Model*
In an ideal situation you are able to salvage your Design Development phase
efforts, but the reality of projects may require you to bring your model
back into wizard mode, reconfigure zoning and window placement, and then
either patch in systems from a previous model through text file, or if the
system design has evolved significantly, you may need to build from scratch.

When all is said and done in this type of consultancy, you are building 4+
models, including working models, all to differing levels of detail.

In our experience a final model, done right, would take about 80 hours.

 

WARNING ? frustrated modeling rant to follow:

 

Doing just a final model however completely misses the point as to why we
model ? it is to guide design decisions!  

 

If I saw this RFP and all it asked me for was a model to determine LEED
points, during or after design, I would try to educate the potential client
about the purpose of modeling.

 

Unfortunately too many projects pursuing LEED are only doing the minimum
when it comes to modeling and almost completely missing all the benefits.
Too often the ?market? transforms only based on a least first cost
denominator basis that results in little real transformation.  Doing models
to determine LEED points does not transform the market, save any energy, and
just circumvents the purpose behind LEED. (the next version actually
requires design phase modeling!)

 

Any ?modeler? who does only final models without attempting to explain to
the owner why this is a bad idea should be ?drummed out of the corp? in my
humble opinion.

 

The problem is that if you respond to this RFP with 120 or 160 or more hours
to really do the design phase modeling right, you will go up against the
?modeler? who claims to be able to do it in far less time.  So how do we get
the folks who issue the RFPs to ask for a proper scope of work so that they
can compare fees on a level playing field?  It is unfortunate that we are
even having a discussion about doing modeling work in opposition to its
purpose.

 

Sorry for the rant but I feel better now. J

Hi all,
I also agree with the 2 weeks and if in the 
building is in Canada it is easyer to use EE4 as 
you get the MNECB base line and in the US Equest 
can give you a title 24 that is accepted as 90.1 baseline

Thanks everyone for you help! You have been really helpful.

The design phase is (supposedly) almost complete (of course that's rarely
the case as we all know).  I still need to see the 

mechanical plans, but I know it's a CHW system. I'm not the LEED AP for the
project so the documentation and LEED Online

time are out of my scope. Looking at the architectural plans it doesn't seem
too complicated if it's a CHW system.

 

James and Arpan, thanks for the detailed explanations and  advice. The
service they are asking for is just to model the building as 

designed. Of course, if it doesn't reach the desired level energy-wise I'm
sure will have to become an advisor on this part as well

so I'm taking all that into consideration. I usually include a set number of
modifications to the initial model to avoid the back and forth

that happens when everyone starts giving independent opinion. After the
first model I usually conduct a meeting with the whole

team to discuss the results and alternatives. Normally I won't modify the
model until the whole team is moving in the same direction

with the changes that are being proposed. I have found that it saves me a
whole lot of time, lol.

 

Marcus, I totally agree with you on your rant! That's why I asked this
question on the first place. Normally, when I do an existing 

building model for building optimization the owner is willing to listen to
every advice and really analyze every aspect of the process, 

not just initial cost. Because of this the process is "simplified". But,
since this is an RFP for LEED points, well, I really do not know what

carries more weight, if it really is the energy conservation, or if it is
just getting the points with as little investment as possible to

get the certificate.

 

So, since I know I'll be competing with the "modelers" Marcus mentions I
don't want to set the price too high. At the same time, since

it will be my first LEED model I don't want to set it so low that I get
burned. But with the responses you've given me I think I have a pretty 

good idea of what to do. 

 

Thanks again, and Marcus, I promise to explain everything to the owner, even
if my explanations fall on deaf ears. J

Dear Omar,

 

My opinion is that you?ve done the harder project already ? an existing
building!

For a LEED certification you often have more freedom in certain areas, such
as occupancy and equipment schedules because all schedules do not need to be
precise ? they?re just someone?s best estimate.  In an existing building
model, you must get fairly precise so that your model matches the utility
bills.

For LEED, you have:

?         One geometry description (length, width, height, windows)

?         One set of schedules for occupancy and diversity

?         One set of information about ?process? equipment

?         2 sets of materials (Walls, Roof, windows for Baseline per 90.1
and actual)

?         2 sets of HVAC equipment (Baseline and actual)

o   Carefully consider zoning before you begin and review the requirements
for Baseline systems in 90.1.  You may have more than one system type,
especially if some areas of the building have significantly different
schedules or other criteria.

?         2 reports (generally ?ABUPS? is needed for each model) which
describe the key differences between the systems and their performance

o   Including performance in sub-categories such as ?lights?, ?cooling?,
?heating? as described in the LEED documentation

?         1 comparison of the 2 systems which results in an overall
operating cost comparison.

?         Some time with LEED online to load all of your reports

?         Possible time to discuss and explain results with the LEED
reviewer

 

I normally exclude from my scope the documentation of all of the mandatory
requirements in Sections 5-10 of 90.1.  These are normally much easier to
document if you are the designer, since the information is readily at hand
and, presumably, you have incorporated them purposefully during the design
process.  I also state that we do NOT guarantee any LEED points whatsoever;
that?s the designer?s option.  The modeler is only documenting estimated
performance what has been designed, not guaranteeing its performance.
Finally, we also state that the performance is estimated, not necessarily
even close to what will actually occur.  I show some typical language below.

 

As you can see, I?m not saying ?40 hours?.  Rather, compare what you know
about the cost for an existing building to the items which are different in
a LEED certification for a new building, make an estimate using that
information.  I hope that is helpful!

 

1.    Energy models are not intended or expected to match closely with
actual energy use.  They ARE expected to provide a reasonable basis from
which to judge overall patterns and enable comparison of design options.   
New buildings, especially, represent challenges which are not precisely
quantifiable by an energy model.  These include:

?         Patterns of occupancy and lighting use are not established

?         Equipment, including office PCs and copiers, has not been
installed and it is not known how much power will be used nor how often.

?         Weather patterns vary from year to year, while the energy model
uses a ?typical? weather pattern.

?         Equipment efficiencies, control sequences and controls calibration
normally vary from planned, design information.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Energy Model Cost

 

Greetings everyone,

 

I have a question regarding the cost of an energy model for a LEED project.
Every energy model I've done so far has been for 

existing buildings, mainly for optimization purposes. However, I received an
RFP to model a five-story, 41,500 sq. ft. building

that's currently on the design phase and is pursuing the LEED-NC Silver
certification. I really have no idea what would be a fair 

price for this model since I'm going to have to use Appendix G (ASHRAE 90.1)
to evaluate the difference between the base 

and proposed buildings. I don't know how much extra effort this will take. I
know the procedure, just haven't done it before.

 

Can you shed any light on this issue?

 

Thanks in advance!

Marcus,

You have inadvertently hit upon why IBPSA worked with ASHRAE to create a
BEMP certification. That's Building Energy Modeling Professional (BEMP).

Some of us who have been in the field for awhile began to worry a couple of
years ago when so many new energy modelers began appearing on the listserv
with questions. Their questions indicated a lack of training and experience
that was worrisome. What made it worrisome was that they didn't seem to
realize that they were as inexperienced as they were; they didn't appear to
be pursuing training to learn how to do what they were doing; and we were
uncertain as to how or if they were practicing quality control. We hoped
that by creating a path to certification that we would give clients one more
qualification to look for in their modelers.

If you have been in this industry for any length of time, and by industry I
mean the overall construction industry, you know that you don't get a lot of
chances if your work doesn't pan out. If your energy model says I have a
LEED Gold building and I'm going to save $4,000/year and what I really get
is LEED Silver and $1,000/year, I am not going to be happy. So, I will
probably not give you any more work but, even worse for all of us, I'll
start expressing doubts about the whole process. LEED - what is it good for?

So, now we all have more training, right? We read our ASHRAE Handbooks and
technical manuals so we know how to model the difficult stuff. We can find
any topic in the DOE2 Manuals, all of which are one line, available, and
easily searchable.

So now we are so good we can do these models in 40-80 hours. Really? Not me
and I've been doing it longer than everyone, except you, John Aulbach. So
I'm going to join Marcus in his rant because he's on to something.

It's up to us to not under bid this work. It's up to us to educate our
clients about the importance of quality in this process. If they think they
are getting the same analysis in 40 hours that they used to get in 120
hours, they need to be led around to rethinking that and to be reminded that
GIGO.

Cheers,

Carol

I agree with some points already stated.

1.  Existing buildings have existing information.  A LEED model is a lot more
of an art.  There are a lot of judgment calls.  And just as often, the
guidance you receive on what to assume is just wrong.  (I was directed to
model a church as 100% full each Sunday for 3 services.  That is good for
equipment sizing not for an energy model.)

2.  The design assumes certain equipment, but the LEED model can't be
complete until the you receive the submittals to find what equipment is
actually purchased.  To do it right, changes during construction should be
added to the model.

Dear Omar,

 

My opinion is that you've done the harder project already - an existing
building!

For a LEED certification you often have more freedom in certain areas, such
as occupancy and equipment schedules because all schedules do not need to be
precise - they're just someone's best estimate.  In an existing building
model, you must get fairly precise so that your model matches the utility
bills.

For LEED, you have:

?         One geometry description (length, width, height, windows)

?         One set of schedules for occupancy and diversity

?         One set of information about "process" equipment

?         2 sets of materials (Walls, Roof, windows for Baseline per 90.1 and
actual)

?         2 sets of HVAC equipment (Baseline and actual)

o   Carefully consider zoning before you begin and review the requirements
for Baseline systems in 90.1.  You may have more than one system type,
especially if some areas of the building have significantly different
schedules or other criteria.

?         2 reports (generally "ABUPS" is needed for each model) which
describe the key differences between the systems and their performance

o   Including performance in sub-categories such as "lights", "cooling",
"heating" as described in the LEED documentation

?         1 comparison of the 2 systems which results in an overall operating
cost comparison.

?         Some time with LEED online to load all of your reports

?         Possible time to discuss and explain results with the LEED reviewer

 

I normally exclude from my scope the documentation of all of the mandatory
requirements in Sections 5-10 of 90.1.  These are normally much easier to
document if you are the designer, since the information is readily at hand
and, presumably, you have incorporated them purposefully during the design
process.  I also state that we do NOT guarantee any LEED points whatsoever;
that's the designer's option.  The modeler is only documenting estimated
performance what has been designed, not guaranteeing its performance.
Finally, we also state that the performance is estimated, not necessarily
even close to what will actually occur.  I show some typical language below.

 

As you can see, I'm not saying "40 hours".  Rather, compare what you know
about the cost for an existing building to the items which are different in a
LEED certification for a new building, make an estimate using that
information.  I hope that is helpful!

 

1.    Energy models are not intended or expected to match closely with actual
energy use.  They ARE expected to provide a reasonable basis from which to
judge overall patterns and enable comparison of design options.   
New buildings, especially, represent challenges which are not precisely
quantifiable by an energy model.  These include:

?         Patterns of occupancy and lighting use are not established

?         Equipment, including office PCs and copiers, has not been installed
and it is not known how much power will be used nor how often.

?         Weather patterns vary from year to year, while the energy model
uses a "typical" weather pattern.

?         Equipment efficiencies, control sequences and controls calibration
normally vary from planned, design information.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Energy Model Cost

 

Greetings everyone,

 

I have a question regarding the cost of an energy model for a LEED project.
Every energy model I've done so far has been for 

existing buildings, mainly for optimization purposes. However, I received an
RFP to model a five-story, 41,500 sq. ft. building

that's currently on the design phase and is pursuing the LEED-NC Silver
certification. I really have no idea what would be a fair 

price for this model since I'm going to have to use Appendix G (ASHRAE 90.1)
to evaluate the difference between the base 

and proposed buildings. I don't know how much extra effort this will take. I
know the procedure, just haven't done it before.

 

Can you shed any light on this issue?

 

Thanks in advance!

OK, Carol..now you threw the "bait" out there..older than dirt, eh?

I have done very limited LEED "type" modeling where you compare 20 walls and 40 
windows types (well, it seemed that way).?Correct me if I am wrong, but a Base 
model must be built to comply with a certain level of ASHRAE 90.1 (now up to 
2010 ??). With all of the nuisances of eQuest 3.64, I am going to build the 
model from scrathc and put in all the relevant baseline data in by hand.? And, 
by the way, the ASHRAE baseline model might be an entirely different system.? I 
am just completing an EPACT evaluation (ASHRAE 90.1-2001) and the Baseline HVAC 
was screwe chillers, whereas the Actual building was packaged units with 
Turbocor compressors (ask me how?I did that).

It very much depends on the complexity of the building. A 40,000 sf office or a 
500,000 sf hotel with casino facilites.

I am unfamiliar with the LEED paperwork to be filled out after the modeling has 
been done. But I would not do anything of this type in under 120 hours, 
preferably 160 hours. If the client thinks he can do better, let him.

Contingency, contingency.

We won't discuss how old CAROL might be..

Marcus,

You have inadvertently hit upon why IBPSA worked with ASHRAE to create a BEMP 
certification. That's Building Energy Modeling Professional (BEMP). 


Some of us who have been in the field for awhile began to worry a couple of 
years ago when so many new energy modelers began appearing on the listserv with 
questions. Their questions indicated a lack of training and experience that was 
worrisome. What made it worrisome was that they didn't seem to realize that they 
were as inexperienced as they were; they didn't appear to be pursuing training 
to learn how to do what they were doing; and we were uncertain as to how or if 
they were practicing quality control. We hoped that by creating a path to 
certification that we would give clients one more qualification to look for in 
their modelers.

If you have been in this industry for any length of time, and by industry I mean 
the overall construction industry, you know that you don't get a lot of chances 
if your work doesn't pan out. If your energy model says I have a LEED Gold 
building and I'm going to save $4,000/year and what I really get is LEED Silver 
and $1,000/year, I am not going to be happy. So, I will probably not give you 
any more work but, even worse for all of us, I'll start expressing doubts about 
the whole process. LEED - what is it good for?

So, now we all have more training, right? We read our ASHRAE Handbooks and 
technical manuals so we know how to model the difficult stuff. We can find any 
topic in the DOE2 Manuals, all of which are one line, available, and easily 
searchable. 


So now we are so good we can do these models in 40-80 hours. Really? Not me and 
I've been doing it longer than everyone, except you, John Aulbach. So I'm going 
to join Marcus in his rant because he's on to something.

It's up to us to not under bid this work. It's up to us to educate our clients 
about the importance of quality in this process. If they think they are getting 
the same analysis in 40 hours that they used to get in 120 hours, they need to 
be led around to rethinking that and to be reminded that GIGO.

Cheers,

Carol

Hi, everyone,

In my experience, 160 hours working time is only for design submission, for
a mid-complex building.

There are something maybe happen which cost a lot of time:


   1. Most of time the client and also MEP partners will compare the
   building loads between energy model and MEP partners calculation. The
   modeler need to find the calculation difference, and figure out why this
   would happen and how to fix.
   2. Architect and MEP partners will ask the modeler to do parametric
   studies to compare options. The modeler need to run the model - sometimes
   there will be some issues which also need time to solve.
   3. Client wants to know the effect of each energy saving strategy. The
   modeler need to do a lot of runs to make clear about this. And also there
   will be some problems happen, modeler need time to solve it.

After received the comments from USGBC, it depends on how many comments you
get. Normally 40 hours around to answer those questions if the model has no
big mistake or missing.

In the end there should be some extra hour for safety which depends on the
complex of the project.

Best Regards,

Grammy, Jiang

Interesting discussion!  I'll avoid the vintage debate... if you guys are a finely-aged bottle of wine, that just makes me grape juice =)!  

 

"Good" energy models can encompass a range of accuracies/expectations...  

1.       On one hand, some clients require the models match "reality."  This desire sometimes needs to be tempered with the unknowns of new construction & future performance, but given enough historical data a well-calibrated model is certainly approachable.  "Calibrated modeling" has nothing to do with LEED-NC.  

2.       On the other hand, forward-thinking design team members will approach me to isolate specific measures and compare their impacts in a relative fashion to make informed energy-conscious design decisions.  In this case, nobody cares whether the rest of the model is anything other than a "from the hip" estimate, but it's up to the modeler to determine what variables deserve extra attention for their effects on determining the outcome.  A "good" model in this context delivers quick answers which are accurate in a relative sense, isolating the correct variables.  "Preliminary modeling" is a very distinct skillset, is often based on little "real" data, and requires a different mindset to indentify all the variables in play so as to isolate what's not critical to the study at hand.

3.       Somewhere in between these extremes lies the realm of "LEED models."  LEED-NC models can be characterized as 'prescriptive guesswork.'   They are based on design decisions made (but NOT reality).  EPAcT and code-compliance modeling are similar in this regard.

 

Each mode of modeling requires different time investments, each has marketable value, and one can be an expert in one mode of modeling while being inexperienced in another.  

 

If I were asked:  Is it feasible to construct a model that will survive the rigors of a LEED review and earn a lot of points in 80 working hours?  The answer is yes, it's definitely feasible.  The actual number depends heavily on the complexities of the proposed design as others have explained well enough, but for a simple enough project, 1 to 2 working weeks could easily be more than enough.  I'd reinforce the earlier points to add a fluff factors if you're unfamiliar with the process or systems involved.  

 

That said:  A "good" LEED model is in my definition simply one that earns a lot of points after review/approval.  A good design helps "good" LEED models happen, but the reverse isn't true. 

 

 A "good" model in the context of "accuracy nearing reality" implies a much higher caliber modeler and an extended timeframe.

 

I take a firm stance that LEED/90.1 are not a means of enforcing "reality" upon a model.  To rephrase/reinforce:  a LEED model is not a "real" model.  The sole function/purpose of a LEED model is to earn LEED points.  Now, that's not to say a LEED model during its creation is not of some use to the design team, but such models are frankly most efficiently put together after the design process is well under way/finished.  

 

The intent of EAc1, in my opinion, dances between two commendable goals:

1.       Design buildings that use less energy

2.       Get an energy modeler on the team to inform the design, helping to achieve goal #1

 

Problem is, 90.1 Appendix G is not a guideline/standard for how to inform design.  EAc1/EAp2/90.1 as currently constructed is a metric for assessing the performance of the final design, after the critical decisions are made.  That's why "LEED models" are best built after design is (mostly) complete, and that's why "LEED models" make for a flawed approach to guiding early design.  In the course of a LEED project, I am always a part of the design team (typically directly involved in electrical/mechanical design), and will often construct "preliminary" models along the way to guide the process where questions come up across disciplines.  These models bear little resemblance to a final LEED model, but help the design move in a direction that actually saves energy.  This is very different from the documenting performance against an arbitrary baseline.  As a result of this early involvement, getting lots of EAc1 points later is a simple matter of correctly modeling the actual design, not "finding points."

 

I can't offer much regarding hourly estimates to the independent consultants out there... Rather than charging an hourly rate for modeling services rendered, I am typically embedded in the design team, and said efforts are rolled into "design hours."  Modeling generally isn't billed separately, but rather treated as value added to our design services.  Hours spent on modeling is not the critical figure here, though it can be extensive in scope - what's important is the repeat business we get from very satisfied clients, both inside and outside of LEED.

 

Hope some of that helps!  It's mostly my current perspective  - I reserve the right to change my mind =).

I agree with some points already stated.

 

1.  Existing buildings have existing information.  A LEED model is a lot more

of an art.  There are a lot of judgment calls.  And just as often, the

guidance you receive on what to assume is just wrong.  (I was directed to

model a church as 100% full each Sunday for 3 services.  That is good for

equipment sizing not for an energy model.)

 

2.  The design assumes certain equipment, but the LEED model can't be

complete until the you receive the submittals to find what equipment is

actually purchased.  To do it right, changes during construction should be

added to the model.

If your energy model says I have a LEED Gold building and I'm going to save $4,000/year and what I really get is LEED Silver and $1,000/year, I am not going to be happy. So, I will probably not give you any more work but, even worse for all of us, I'll start expressing doubts about the whole process. LEED - what is it good for?

So, now we all have more training, right? We read our ASHRAE Handbooks and technical manuals so we know how to model the difficult stuff. We can find any topic in the DOE2 Manuals, all of which are one line, available, and easily searchable. 

So now we are so good we can do these models in 40-80 hours. Really? Not me and I've been doing it longer than everyone, except you, John Aulbach. So I'm going to join Marcus in his rant because he's on to something.

It's up to us to not under bid this work. It's up to us to educate our clients about the importance of quality in this process. If they think they are getting the same analysis in 40 hours that they used to get in 120 hours, they need to be led around to rethinking that and to be reminded that GIGO.

Cheers,

Carol

	I would expect, for a building this size, approximately 40 hours (multiply by your hourly rate). The 40 hours include EAp2/EAc1 LEED documentation, and any review you may have to respond to later.

	 

	Now, given that you have never done a LEED model, it will take you more time, possibly up to 40 more hours.

	Greetings everyone,

	 

	I have a question regarding the cost of an energy model for a LEED project. Every energy model I've done so far has been for 

	existing buildings, mainly for optimization purposes. However, I received an RFP to model a five-story, 41,500 sq. ft. building

	that's currently on the design phase and is pursuing the LEED-NC Silver certification. I really have no idea what would be a fair 

	price for this model since I'm going to have to use Appendix G (ASHRAE 90.1) to evaluate the difference between the base 

	and proposed buildings. I don't know how much extra effort this will take. I know the procedure, just haven't done it before.

	 

	Can you shed any light on this issue?

	 

	Thanks in advance!

If anyone has any good ideas about how to structure the LEED credits to end the practice of validation models at the end and encourage/require design phase modeling the folks on the USGBC EA TAG would love to hear them.  The current proposed credit language from the first public comment phase is listed below.

 

NC, CS, SCHOOLS, RETAIL, WAREHOUSE & DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, HOSPITALITY

Establish an energy performance target no later than the schematic design phase. The target must be established as kBTU per square foot-year of source energy use. This target must be mapped on the same scale as the baseline and proposed buildings, if the project follows Option 1.

 

OPTION 1. Whole Building Energy Simulation 

Analyze a minimum of at least nine efficiency measures during the design process and account for the results in design decision-making. Analysis can include energy simulation of efficiency opportunities, application of past energy simulation analyses for similar projects to the project, or application of published data from energy analyses performed for similar projects to the project (such as AEDGs).

 

A minimum of six energy efficiency measures focused on load reduction strategies appropriate for the facility must be analyzed. This analysis must be performed during the schematic design phase.

 

A minimum of three energy efficiency measures focused on HVAC related strategies must be analyzed (passive measures are acceptable). This analysis must be performed before the conclusion of the design development phase.

 

The results of the analysis must be summarized in a brief report or memorandum.

 

 

The next version of LEED will be going out for public comment again in July, I think, so please comment formally as well as discussing here.

OK, Carol..now you threw the "bait" out there..older than dirt, eh?

 

I have done very limited LEED "type" modeling where you compare 20 walls and 40 windows types (well, it seemed that way). Correct me if I am wrong, but a Base model must be built to comply with a certain level of ASHRAE 90.1 (now up to 2010 ??). With all of the nuisances of eQuest 3.64, I am going to build the model from scrathc and put in all the relevant baseline data in by hand.  And, by the way, the ASHRAE baseline model might be an entirely different system.  I am just completing an EPACT evaluation (ASHRAE 90.1-2001) and the Baseline HVAC was screwe chillers, whereas the Actual building was packaged units with Turbocor compressors (ask me how I did that).

 

It very much depends on the complexity of the building. A 40,000 sf office or a 500,000 sf hotel with casino facilites.

 

I am unfamiliar with the LEED paperwork to be filled out after the modeling has been done. But I would not do anything of this type in under 120 hours, preferably 160 hours. If the client thinks he can do better, let him.

 

Contingency, contingency.

 

We won't discuss how old CAROL might be..

 

John A.

Marcus,

You have inadvertently hit upon why IBPSA worked with ASHRAE to create a BEMP certification. That's Building Energy Modeling Professional (BEMP). 

Some of us who have been in the field for awhile began to worry a couple of years ago when so many new energy modelers began appearing on the listserv with questions. Their questions indicated a lack of training and experience that was worrisome. What made it worrisome was that they didn't seem to realize that they were as inexperienced as they were; they didn't appear to be pursuing training to learn how to do what they were doing; and we were uncertain as to how or if they were practicing quality control. We hoped that by creating a path to certification that we would give clients one more qualification to look for in their modelers.

If you have been in this industry for any length of time, and by industry I mean the overall construction industry, you know that you don't get a lot of chances if your work doesn't pan out.

SOOOO ON TARGET!!!! Unfortunatley in NY, NYSERDA exacerbates the issue because they get owners to use their TA's for modeling and just cover the cost of the final (and the owner's aren't knowledgable enough to understand what they are getting) completely defeating the real benefit of the model; an iterative process to guide the design.

Energy Modeling Accuracy: It depends on the required level of accuracy. It can be done in one hours or even less, and could take two months with extensive calibrating and preferably field data monitoring for calibration. Same thing with the experience of the modeler: It might not require any experience at all or a modeler must be expert in mechanical system, heat transfer, moisture transfer, lighting deign, etc, and specializations in certain parts of energy modeling. Since LEED does not have staff to check or verify the level of modeling accuracy, I think LEED requires modeling just to satisfy getting points.

SOOOO ON TARGET!!!! Unfortunatley in NY, NYSERDA exacerbates the issue because they get owners to use their TA's for modeling and just cover the cost of the final (and the owner's aren't knowledgable enough to understand what they are getting) completely defeating the real benefit of the model; an iterative process to guide the design.

Marcus, 

You have inadvertently hit upon why IBPSA worked with ASHRAE to create a BEMP certification. That's Building Energy Modeling Professional (BEMP). 

Some of us who have been in the field for awhile began to worry a couple of years ago when so many new energy modelers began appearing on the listserv with questions. Their questions indicated a lack of training and experience that was worrisome. What made it worrisome was that they didn't seem to realize that they were as inexperienced as they were; they didn't appear to be pursuing training to learn how to do what they were doing; and we were uncertain as to how or if they were practicing quality control. We hoped that by creating a path to certification that we would give clients one more qualification to look for in their modelers. 

If you have been in this industry for any length of time, and by industry I mean the overall construction industry, you know that you don't get a lot of chances if your work doesn't pan out. If your energy model says I have a LEED Gold building and I'm going to save $4,000/year and what I really get is LEED Silver and $1,000/year, I am not going to be happy. So, I will probably not give you any more work but, even worse for all of us, I'll start expressing doubts about the whole process. LEED - what is it good for? 

So, now we all have more training, right? We read our ASHRAE Handbooks and technical manuals so we know how to model the difficult stuff. We can find any topic in the DOE2 Manuals, all of which are one line, available, and easily searchable. 

So now we are so good we can do these models in 40-80 hours. Really? Not me and I've been doing it longer than everyone, except you, John Aulbach. So I'm going to join Marcus in his rant because he's on to something. 

It's up to us to not under bid this work. It's up to us to educate our clients about the importance of quality in this process. If they think they are getting the same analysis in 40 hours that they used to get in 120 hours, they need to be led around to rethinking that and to be reminded that GIGO. 

Cheers, 

Carol

In our experience a final model, done right, would take about 80 hours. 



WARNING - frustrated modeling rant to follow: 



Doing just a final model however completely misses the point as to why we model - it is to guide design decisions! 



If I saw this RFP and all it asked me for was a model to determine LEED points, during or after design, I would try to educate the potential client about the purpose of modeling. 



Unfortunately too many projects pursuing LEED are only doing the minimum when it comes to modeling and almost completely missing all the benefits. Too often the "market" transforms only based on a least first cost denominator basis that results in little real transformation. Doing models to determine LEED points does not transform the market, save any energy, and just circumvents the purpose behind LEED. (the next version actually requires design phase modeling!) 



Any "modeler" who does only final models without attempting to explain to the owner why this is a bad idea should be "drummed out of the corp" in my humble opinion. 



The problem is that if you respond to this RFP with 120 or 160 or more hours to really do the design phase modeling right, you will go up against the "modeler" who claims to be able to do it in far less time. So how do we get the folks who issue the RFPs to ask for a proper scope of work so that they can compare fees on a level playing field? It is unfortunate that we are even having a discussion about doing modeling work in opposition to its purpose. 



Sorry for the rant but I feel better now. J

Omar, 



I would expect, for a building this size, approximately 40 hours (multiply by your hourly rate). The 40 hours include EAp2/EAc1 LEED documentation, and any review you may have to respond to later. 



Now, given that you have never done a LEED model, it will take you more time, possibly up to 40 more hours.

Greetings everyone, 



I have a question regarding the cost of an energy model for a LEED project. Every energy model I've done so far has been for 

existing buildings, mainly for optimization purposes. However, I received an RFP to model a five-story, 41,500 sq. ft. building 

that's currently on the design phase and is pursuing the LEED-NC Silver certification. I really have no idea what would be a fair 

price for this model since I'm going to have to use Appendix G (ASHRAE 90.1) to evaluate the difference between the base 

and proposed buildings. I don't know how much extra effort this will take. I know the procedure, just haven't done it before. 



Can you shed any light on this issue? 



Thanks in advance!

We all agree that ideally the energy model should guide the design process. Now, this is a final model (which again can be done in 40 hours for someone who is well versed in LEED modeling). There is no shame in accepting a final model job. One has to be realistic if running a business.

If there are time management issues or to improve work procedures, please allow me to suggest the excellent book by Dr Jon Hand of ESRU: The ESP-r Cookbook.

Subject: RE: [Bldg-sim] Energy Model Cost

Thanks everyone for you help! You have been really helpful.
The design phase is (supposedly) almost complete (of course that's rarely the case as we all know).  I still need to see the
mechanical plans, but I know it's a CHW system. I'm not the LEED AP for the project so the documentation and LEED Online
time are out of my scope. Looking at the architectural plans it doesn't seem too complicated if it's a CHW system.

James and Arpan, thanks for the detailed explanations and  advice. The service they are asking for is just to model the building as
designed. Of course, if it doesn't reach the desired level energy-wise I'm sure will have to become an advisor on this part as well
so I'm taking all that into consideration. I usually include a set number of modifications to the initial model to avoid the back and forth
that happens when everyone starts giving independent opinion. After the first model I usually conduct a meeting with the whole
team to discuss the results and alternatives. Normally I won't modify the model until the whole team is moving in the same direction
with the changes that are being proposed. I have found that it saves me a whole lot of time, lol.

Marcus, I totally agree with you on your rant! That's why I asked this question on the first place. Normally, when I do an existing
building model for building optimization the owner is willing to listen to every advice and really analyze every aspect of the process,
not just initial cost. Because of this the process is "simplified". But, since this is an RFP for LEED points, well, I really do not know what
carries more weight, if it really is the energy conservation, or if it is just getting the points with as little investment as possible to
get the certificate.

So, since I know I'll be competing with the "modelers" Marcus mentions I don't want to set the price too high. At the same time, since
it will be my first LEED model I don't want to set it so low that I get burned. But with the responses you've given me I think I have a pretty
good idea of what to do.

Thanks again, and Marcus, I promise to explain everything to the owner, even if my explanations fall on deaf ears. :)

Subject: RE: [Bldg-sim] Energy Model Cost

Dear Omar,

My opinion is that you've done the harder project already - an existing building!
For a LEED certification you often have more freedom in certain areas, such as occupancy and equipment schedules because all schedules do not need to be precise - they're just someone's best estimate.  In an existing building model, you must get fairly precise so that your model matches the utility bills.
For LEED, you have:

?         One geometry description (length, width, height, windows)

?         One set of schedules for occupancy and diversity

?         One set of information about "process" equipment

?         2 sets of materials (Walls, Roof, windows for Baseline per 90.1 and actual)

?         2 sets of HVAC equipment (Baseline and actual)

o   Carefully consider zoning before you begin and review the requirements for Baseline systems in 90.1.  You may have more than one system type, especially if some areas of the building have significantly different schedules or other criteria.

?         2 reports (generally "ABUPS" is needed for each model) which describe the key differences between the systems and their performance

o   Including performance in sub-categories such as "lights", "cooling", "heating" as described in the LEED documentation

?         1 comparison of the 2 systems which results in an overall operating cost comparison.

?         Some time with LEED online to load all of your reports

?         Possible time to discuss and explain results with the LEED reviewer

I normally exclude from my scope the documentation of all of the mandatory requirements in Sections 5-10 of 90.1.  These are normally much easier to document if you are the designer, since the information is readily at hand and, presumably, you have incorporated them purposefully during the design process.  I also state that we do NOT guarantee any LEED points whatsoever; that's the designer's option.  The modeler is only documenting estimated performance what has been designed, not guaranteeing its performance.  Finally, we also state that the performance is estimated, not necessarily even close to what will actually occur.  I show some typical language below.

As you can see, I'm not saying "40 hours".  Rather, compare what you know about the cost for an existing building to the items which are different in a LEED certification for a new building, make an estimate using that information.  I hope that is helpful!

1.    Energy models are not intended or expected to match closely with actual energy use.  They ARE expected to provide a reasonable basis from which to judge overall patterns and enable comparison of design options.
New buildings, especially, represent challenges which are not precisely quantifiable by an energy model.  These include:
?         Patterns of occupancy and lighting use are not established
?         Equipment, including office PCs and copiers, has not been installed and it is not known how much power will be used nor how often.
?         Weather patterns vary from year to year, while the energy model uses a "typical" weather pattern.
?         Equipment efficiencies, control sequences and controls calibration normally vary from planned, design information.

Marcus, thank you incorporating this language.

The one scenario we often see in our design guidance work is that a  
proposed design when compared with other design alternates does not  
necessarily provided the largest energy savings when compared against  
its own baseline case model. It is difficult to make a recommendation  
as consultants when we want to present the Owner with both real energy  
cost savings without compromising their LEED certification level  
targets.

A recent paper presented by the Weidt Group at SimBuild touched on  
this issue:

Do you know where we can get a copy of the existing draft? I?d like to look more into the new wordage for EAp2/EAc1 and how energy modeling will have to evolve once that new rating system is released.

If anyone has any good ideas about how to structure the LEED credits to end the practice of validation models at the end and encourage/require design phase modeling the folks on the USGBC EA TAG would love to hear them.  The current proposed credit language from the first public comment phase is listed below.

 

NC, CS, SCHOOLS, RETAIL, WAREHOUSE & DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, HOSPITALITY

Establish an energy performance target no later than the schematic design phase. The target must be established as kBTU per square foot-year of source energy use. This target must be mapped on the same scale as the baseline and proposed buildings, if the project follows Option 1.

 

OPTION 1. Whole Building Energy Simulation 

Analyze a minimum of at least nine efficiency measures during the design process and account for the results in design decision-making. Analysis can include energy simulation of efficiency opportunities, application of past energy simulation analyses for similar projects to the project, or application of published data from energy analyses performed for similar projects to the project (such as AEDGs).

 

A minimum of six energy efficiency measures focused on load reduction strategies appropriate for the facility must be analyzed. This analysis must be performed during the schematic design phase.

 

A minimum of three energy efficiency measures focused on HVAC related strategies must be analyzed (passive measures are acceptable). This analysis must be performed before the conclusion of the design development phase.

 

The results of the analysis must be summarized in a brief report or memorandum.

 

 

The next version of LEED will be going out for public comment again in July, I think, so please comment formally as well as discussing here.

OK, Carol..now you threw the "bait" out there..older than dirt, eh?

 

I have done very limited LEED "type" modeling where you compare 20 walls and 40 windows types (well, it seemed that way). Correct me if I am wrong, but a Base model must be built to comply with a certain level of ASHRAE 90.1 (now up to 2010 ??). With all of the nuisances of eQuest 3.64, I am going to build the model from scrathc and put in all the relevant baseline data in by hand.  And, by the way, the ASHRAE baseline model might be an entirely different system.  I am just completing an EPACT evaluation (ASHRAE 90.1-2001) and the Baseline HVAC was screwe chillers, whereas the Actual building was packaged units with Turbocor compressors (ask me how I did that).

 

It very much depends on the complexity of the building. A 40,000 sf office or a 500,000 sf hotel with casino facilites.

 

I am unfamiliar with the LEED paperwork to be filled out after the modeling has been done. But I would not do anything of this type in under 120 hours, preferably 160 hours. If the client thinks he can do better, let him.

 

Contingency, contingency.

 

We won't discuss how old CAROL might be..

Marcus,

You have inadvertently hit upon why IBPSA worked with ASHRAE to create a BEMP certification. That's Building Energy Modeling Professional (BEMP). 

Some of us who have been in the field for awhile began to worry a couple of years ago when so many new energy modelers began appearing on the listserv with questions. Their questions indicated a lack of training and experience that was worrisome. What made it worrisome was that they didn't seem to realize that they were as inexperienced as they were; they didn't appear to be pursuing training to learn how to do what they were doing; and we were uncertain as to how or if they were practicing quality control. We hoped that by creating a path to certification that we would give clients one more qualification to look for in their modelers.

If you have been in this industry for any length of time, and by industry I mean the overall construction industry, you know that you don't get a lot of chances if your work doesn't pan out. If your energy model says I have a LEED Gold building and I'm going to save $4,000/year and what I really get is LEED Silver and $1,000/year, I am not going to be happy. So, I will probably not give you any more work but, even worse for all of us, I'll start expressing doubts about the whole process. LEED - what is it good for?

So, now we all have more training, right? We read our ASHRAE Handbooks and technical manuals so we know how to model the difficult stuff. We can find any topic in the DOE2 Manuals, all of which are one line, available, and easily searchable. 

So now we are so good we can do these models in 40-80 hours. Really? Not me and I've been doing it longer than everyone, except you, John Aulbach. So I'm going to join Marcus in his rant because he's on to something.

It's up to us to not under bid this work. It's up to us to educate our clients about the importance of quality in this process. If they think they are getting the same analysis in 40 hours that they used to get in 120 hours, they need to be led around to rethinking that and to be reminded that GIGO.

Cheers,

Carol

GBCI does have technical staff and consultants who do verify modeling accuracy for LEED projects, to a degree.  While they do not have the time to check the modeling file itself, they do review inputs and results for accuracy.  They also enforce the Appendix G protocol which ensures uniformity, also to a degree.

 

If you do the minimum, then yes, LEED only requires modeling to determine points.  Personally I am not satisfied with doing the minimum for any client and don?t like to work for clients who only want a plaque.  This is not an indictment of LEED itself but of the way that this tool is used in the market.  See my previous post about providing ideas for making modeling more effectively used on LEED projects.  How can LEED do better?

Energy Modeling Accuracy: It depends on the required level of accuracy. It can be done in one hours or even less, and could take two months with extensive calibrating and preferably field data monitoring for calibration.  Same thing with the experience of the modeler: It might not require any experience at all or a modeler must be expert in mechanical system, heat transfer, moisture transfer, lighting deign, etc, and specializations in certain parts of energy modeling. Since LEED does not have staff to check or verify the level of modeling accuracy, I think LEED requires modeling just to satisfy getting points.

SOOOO ON TARGET!!!! Unfortunatley in NY, NYSERDA exacerbates the issue because they get owners to use their TA's for modeling and just cover the cost of the final (and the owner's aren't knowledgable enough to understand what they are getting) completely defeating the real benefit of the model; an iterative process to guide the design.

If your energy model says I have a LEED Gold building and I'm going to save $4,000/year and what I really get is LEED Silver and $1,000/year, I am not going to be happy. So, I will probably not give you any more work but, even worse for all of us, I'll start expressing doubts about the whole process. LEED - what is it good for?

So, now we all have more training, right? We read our ASHRAE Handbooks and technical manuals so we know how to model the difficult stuff. We can find any topic in the DOE2 Manuals, all of which are one line, available, and easily searchable. 

So now we are so good we can do these models in 40-80 hours. Really? Not me and I've been doing it longer than everyone, except you, John Aulbach. So I'm going to join Marcus in his rant because he's on to something.

It's up to us to not under bid this work. It's up to us to educate our clients about the importance of quality in this process. If they think they are getting the same analysis in 40 hours that they used to get in 120 hours, they need to be led around to rethinking that and to be reminded that GIGO.

Cheers,

Carol

WARNING - frustrated modeling rant to follow:

 

Doing just a final model however completely misses the point as to why we model - it is to guide design decisions!  

 

If I saw this RFP and all it asked me for was a model to determine LEED points, during or after design, I would try to educate the potential client about the purpose of modeling.

 

Unfortunately too many projects pursuing LEED are only doing the minimum when it comes to modeling and almost completely missing all the benefits.  Too often the "market" transforms only based on a least first cost denominator basis that results in little real transformation.  Doing models to determine LEED points does not transform the market, save any energy, and just circumvents the purpose behind LEED. (the next version actually requires design phase modeling!)

 

Any "modeler" who does only final models without attempting to explain to the owner why this is a bad idea should be "drummed out of the corp" in my humble opinion.

 

The problem is that if you respond to this RFP with 120 or 160 or more hours to really do the design phase modeling right, you will go up against the "modeler" who claims to be able to do it in far less time.  So how do we get the folks who issue the RFPs to ask for a proper scope of work so that they can compare fees on a level playing field?  It is unfortunate that we are even having a discussion about doing modeling work in opposition to its purpose.

 

Sorry for the rant but I feel better now. J

Omar,

 

I would expect, for a building this size, approximately 40 hours (multiply by your hourly rate). The 40 hours include EAp2/EAc1 LEED documentation, and any review you may have to respond to later.

 

Now, given that you have never done a LEED model, it will take you more time, possibly up to 40 more hours.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Energy Model Cost

 

Greetings everyone,

 

I have a question regarding the cost of an energy model for a LEED project. Every energy model I've done so far has been for 

existing buildings, mainly for optimization purposes. However, I received an RFP to model a five-story, 41,500 sq. ft. building

that's currently on the design phase and is pursuing the LEED-NC Silver certification. I really have no idea what would be a fair 

price for this model since I'm going to have to use Appendix G (ASHRAE 90.1) to evaluate the difference between the base 

and proposed buildings. I don't know how much extra effort this will take. I know the procedure, just haven't done it before.

 

Can you shed any light on this issue?

 

Thanks in advance!

Carol, to add to the comment about modeling certifications, lets not  
forget you can only manage that which can be measured!

There are two parts to this which we are missing before we can rest  
easy about our models accurately reflecting the mechanical design!

The first is the creation of a modeling handbook in addition to the  
ASHRAE handbooks providing documented modeling methodologies. Until we  
have this in place, even two experienced and 'certified' modelers will  
yield different simulation results when different modeling methods are  
used for the same systems.

The second item is the accuracy of the modeling tool. How can a model  
be accurately reflecting a mechanical design when any of the systems  
designed does not having corresponding mathematical software models  
and the model is a quilt of 'thermodynamical equivalents'? Unless your  
work consists of standard air distribution systems, or you are using  
EnergyPlus or TRNSYS, the majority of models created for LEED  
certification in DOE2 are still comparitive approximations at best,  
and just wrong at worst! I personally feel if we all had to purchase  
annual subscriptions to eQUEST, maybe our friends in California would  
be able to dedicate more resources to aid their development efforts_

Arpan,

 

Based on the Weidt Group paper, I?m guessing you?re emphasizing architectural considerations that affect the energy cost vs. LEED points numbers. (The paper uses window-to-wall ratios and daylighting as an example.) I would think the goal during the programming and schematic design phases should be energy cost, not LEED points relative to the App. G baseline. Much of the energy cost savings vs. App. G baseline (EAc1 points) is going to come later from the mechanical and lighting designs. The suggestions in the paper to establish specific baseline building shapes and glazing percentages would add a LOT more modeling time ? you?d have to create two separate building geometries for the baseline and proposed models, not to mention different zoning patterns, space types, lighting power per space etc.

 

For mechanical design, once the size and programming of the project is established, the baseline model properties are pretty well set, unless you consider fuel-switching and go between baseline systems 1/3/5/7 to systems 2/4/6/8. One exception I can think of for a design decision that results in higher energy cost but better comparison with the App. G baseline is higher ventilation rates combined with heat recovery in the proposed and no heat recovery in the baseline.

 

Regards,

Bill

Marcus, thank you incorporating this language.

 

The one scenario we often see in our design guidance work is that a proposed design when compared with other design alternates does not necessarily provided the largest energy savings when compared against its own baseline case model. It is difficult to make a recommendation as consultants when we want to present the Owner with both real energy cost savings without compromising their LEED certification level targets.  

A recent paper presented by the Weidt Group at SimBuild touched on this issue:

	Analyze a minimum of at least nine efficiency measures during the design process and account for the results in design decision-making.

	A minimum of six energy efficiency measures focused on load reduction strategies appropriate for the facility must be analyzed. This analysis must be performed during the schematic design phase.

	 

	A minimum of three energy efficiency measures focused on HVAC related strategies must be analyzed (passive measures are acceptable). This analysis must be performed before the conclusion of the design development phase.

	 

	The results of the analysis must be summarized in a brief report or memorandum.

	 

	 

	The next version of LEED will be going out for public comment again in July, I think, so please comment formally as well as discussing here.

	OK, Carol..now you threw the "bait" out there..older than dirt, eh?

	 

	I have done very limited LEED "type" modeling where you compare 20 walls and 40 windows types (well, it seemed that way). Correct me if I am wrong, but a Base model must be built to comply with a certain level of ASHRAE 90.1 (now up to 2010 ??). With all of the nuisances of eQuest 3.64, I am going to build the model from scrathc and put in all the relevant baseline data in by hand.  And, by the way, the ASHRAE baseline model might be an entirely different system.  I am just completing an EPACT evaluation (ASHRAE 90.1-2001) and the Baseline HVAC was screwe chillers, whereas the Actual building was packaged units with Turbocor compressors (ask me how I did that).

	 

	It very much depends on the complexity of the building. A 40,000 sf office or a 500,000 sf hotel with casino facilites.

	 

	I am unfamiliar with the LEED paperwork to be filled out after the modeling has been done. But I would not do anything of this type in under 120 hours, preferably 160 hours. If the client thinks he can do better, let him.

	 

	Contingency, contingency.

	 

	We won't discuss how old CAROL might be..

	Marcus,
	
	You have inadvertently hit upon why IBPSA worked with ASHRAE to create a BEMP certification. That's Building Energy Modeling Professional (BEMP). 
	
	Some of us who have been in the field for awhile began to worry a couple of years ago when so many new energy modelers began appearing on the listserv with questions. Their questions indicated a lack of training and experience that was worrisome. What made it worrisome was that they didn't seem to realize that they were as inexperienced as they were; they didn't appear to be pursuing training to learn how to do what they were doing; and we were uncertain as to how or if they were practicing quality control. We hoped that by creating a path to certification that we would give clients one more qualification to look for in their modelers.
	
	If you have been in this industry for any length of time, and by industry I mean the overall construction industry, you know that you don't get a lot of chances if your work doesn't pan out. If your energy model says I have a LEED Gold building and I'm going to save $4,000/year and what I really get is LEED Silver and $1,000/year, I am not going to be happy.

Could any one advice why LEED would not put the base design as Watt per square foot, or per occupant, or per hotel bed etc. so the Architecture becomes more innovative early in the design to save energy?

Arpan, 



Based on the Weidt Group paper, I?m guessing you?re emphasizing architectural considerations that affect the energy cost vs. LEED points numbers. (The paper uses window-to-wall ratios and daylighting as an example.) I would think the goal during the programming and schematic design phases should be energy cost, not LEED points relative to the App. G baseline. Much of the energy cost savings vs. App. G baseline (EAc1 points) is going to come later from the mechanical and lighting designs. The suggestions in the paper to establish specific baseline building shapes and glazing percentages would add a LOT more modeling time ? you?d have to create two separate building geometries for the baseline and proposed models, not to mention different zoning patterns, space types, lighting power per space etc. 



For mechanical design, once the size and programming of the project is established, the baseline model properties are pretty well set, unless you consider fuel-switching and go between baseline systems 1/3/5/7 to systems 2/4/6/8. One exception I can think of for a design decision that results in higher energy cost but better comparison with the App. G baseline is higher ventilation rates combined with heat recovery in the proposed and no heat recovery in the baseline. 



Regards, 

Bill

Marcus, thank you incorporating this language. 





The one scenario we often see in our design guidance work is that a proposed design when compared with other design alternates does not necessarily provided the largest energy savings when compared against its own baseline case model. It is difficult to make a recommendation as consultants when we want to present the Owner with both real energy cost savings without compromising their LEED certification level targets. 


A recent paper presented by the Weidt Group at SimBuild touched on this issue:

OK, Carol..now you threw the "bait" out there..older than dirt, eh? 





I have done very limited LEED "type" modeling where you compare 20 walls and 40 windows types (well, it seemed that way). Correct me if I am wrong, but a Base model must be built to comply with a certain level of ASHRAE 90.1 (now up to 2010 ??). With all of the nuisances of eQuest 3.64, I am going to build the model from scrathc and put in all the relevant baseline data in by hand. And, by the way, the ASHRAE baseline model might be an entirely different system. I am just completing an EPACT evaluation (ASHRAE 90.1-2001) and the Baseline HVAC was screwe chillers, whereas the Actual building was packaged units with Turbocor compressors (ask me how I did that). 





It very much depends on the complexity of the building. A 40,000 sf office or a 500,000 sf hotel with casino facilites. 





I am unfamiliar with the LEED paperwork to be filled out after the modeling has been done. But I would not do anything of this type in under 120 hours, preferably 160 hours. If the client thinks he can do better, let him. 





Contingency, contingency. 





We won't discuss how old CAROL might be..

Marcus, 

You have inadvertently hit upon why IBPSA worked with ASHRAE to create a BEMP certification. That's Building Energy Modeling Professional (BEMP). 

Some of us who have been in the field for awhile began to worry a couple of years ago when so many new energy modelers began appearing on the listserv with questions. Their questions indicated a lack of training and experience that was worrisome. What made it worrisome was that they didn't seem to realize that they were as inexperienced as they were; they didn't appear to be pursuing training to learn how to do what they were doing; and we were uncertain as to how or if they were practicing quality control. We hoped that by creating a path to certification that we would give clients one more qualification to look for in their modelers. 

If you have been in this industry for any length of time, and by industry I mean the overall construction industry, you know that you don't get a lot of chances if your work doesn't pan out. If your energy model says I have a LEED Gold building and I'm going to save $4,000/year and what I really get is LEED Silver and $1,000/year, I am not going to be happy. So, I will probably not give you any more work but, even worse for all of us, I'll start expressing doubts about the whole process. LEED - what is it good for? 

So, now we all have more training, right? We read our ASHRAE Handbooks and technical manuals so we know how to model the difficult stuff. We can find any topic in the DOE2 Manuals, all of which are one line, available, and easily searchable. 

So now we are so good we can do these models in 40-80 hours. Really? Not me and I've been doing it longer than everyone, except you, John Aulbach. So I'm going to join Marcus in his rant because he's on to something. 

It's up to us to not under bid this work. It's up to us to educate our clients about the importance of quality in this process. If they think they are getting the same analysis in 40 hours that they used to get in 120 hours, they need to be led around to rethinking that and to be reminded that GIGO. 

Cheers, 

Carol

Omar,
This is cracking me up.  I don't think I've ever seen this much traffic on one 
issue!  LOL.
Regarding the manhours for a LEED model - my opinion is that the amount of time 
has much more to do with the level of certification the project is going for, at 
what point the modeling services are engaged in the design, and the type and 
complexity of the building (systems).  That's not to say the number of manhours 
is completely independent of building size (square footage), but its not 
particularly sensitive to it.  I find that that there is a high "low" and low 
"high" for modeling.  In other words, it's hard to complete an energy model in 
less than 60-80 hours (all said and done - paperwork, LEED responses etc), but 
it rarely take more than 250 hours.  (Although, some rare complex projects going 
for platinmum could take up to 350 hours).  Like others, I find the norm for a 
reasonably complex bldg going for LEED silver or gold typically requires between 
120 and 160 hours. 


Marcus  
Here's my two cents on below. I will look for the public comment period as 
well.  Thanks for the heads up.
I think the idea of incentivizing modeling early in the design is a great idea, 
but I think requiring it is completely inappropriate.  Perhaps it could be 
encouraged by awarding an extra (innovation? or EA cr 1?) point for starting 
modeling in schematic design.  Or, perhaps the credit could be restructured 
similar to the CX credits where in order to get the enhanced CX credits, you 
have to have the CX agent involved early in the design.  In some ways, the 
current set up already does this though with the progress points for increased 
levels of saving.  Quite frankly, if you are going for 50% savings, you're not 
gonig to get there unless you start modeling really early in the process.
  
I also think prescribing a certain minimum number of ECMs to look at is 
inappropriate and would probably have the adverse effect of discouraging energy 
modeling.  The appropriate number of ECMs is highly project dependent - based on 
building size, scope, complexity, type, level of LEED certification shooting 
for, and not least of all the owner's budget.  Let's face it, the vast majority 
of bldgs out there and that consume most of the energy in the US are (strip) 
malls, grocery stores, restaurants etc.  These projects barely event have a 
schematic, design and CD phase.  While we all love to work on the exotic, 
platinum level, cutting edge, bldgs that are likely to have a large budget for 
design, these are not the majority of bldgs consuming energy.  I think we should 
be doing more to encourage modeling and energy savings amongst the every day 
projects than the "sexy" projects.  It seems to me the best way to do this is to 
offer incentives in this direction in lieu of prescriptive requirements that 
could discourage/put off smaller projects from even attempting to incorporate 
modeling.  


Julia

years ago when so many new energy modelers began appearing on the listserv with 
questions. Their questions indicated a lack of training and experience that was 
worrisome. What made it worrisome was that they didn't seem to realize that they 
were as inexperienced as they were; they didn't appear to be pursuing training 
to learn how to do what they were doing; and we were uncertain as to how or if 
they were practicing quality control. We hoped that by creating a path to 
certification that we would give clients one more qualification to look for in 
their modelers.

If you have been in this industry for any length of time, and by industry I mean 
the overall construction industry, you know that you don't get a lot of chances 
if your work doesn't pan out. If your energy model says I have a LEED Gold 
building and I'm going to save $4,000/year and what I really get is LEED Silver 
and $1,000/year, I am not going to be happy. So, I will probably not give you 
any more work but, even worse for all of us, I'll start expressing doubts about 
the whole process. LEED - what is it good for?

So, now we all have more training, right? We read our ASHRAE Handbooks and 
technical manuals so we know how to model the difficult stuff. We can find any 
topic in the DOE2 Manuals, all of which are one line, available, and easily 
searchable. 


So now we are so good we can do these models in 40-80 hours. Really? Not me and 
I've been doing it longer than everyone, except you, John Aulbach. So I'm going 
to join Marcus in his rant because he's on to something.

It's up to us to not under bid this work. It's up to us to educate our clients 
about the importance of quality in this process. If they think they are getting 
the same analysis in 40 hours that they used to get in 120 hours, they need to 
be led around to rethinking that and to be reminded that GIGO.

Cheers,

Carol

In efforts to summarize the pricing conversation, that the pricing should be
established by modeling complexity instead of by building size, is the
following a fair assessment of what everyone's comments amount to?

LEED Certified: 60-80 hours
LEED Silver: 80-160 hours
LEED Gold: 160-250 hours
LEED Platinum: 250-350 hours

Sure those may be good rules of thumb but at the end of the day you have to look at the manpower, resources, and experience you and your firm have to apply the correct factor on putting that proposal together. 

 

Just my 2 cents.

In efforts to summarize the pricing conversation, that the pricing should be established by modeling complexity instead of by building size, is the following a fair assessment of what everyone's comments amount to?

 

LEED Certified: 60-80 hours

LEED Silver: 80-160 hours

LEED Gold: 160-250 hours

LEED Platinum: 250-350 hours

Omar,
This is cracking me up.  I don't think I've ever seen this much traffic on one issue!  LOL.
Regarding the manhours for a LEED model - my opinion is that the amount of time has much more to do with the level of certification the project is going for, at what point the modeling services are engaged in the design, and the type and complexity of the building (systems).  That's not to say the number of manhours is completely independent of building size (square footage), but its not particularly sensitive to it.  I find that that there is a high "low" and low "high" for modeling.  In other words, it's hard to complete an energy model in less than 60-80 hours (all said and done - paperwork, LEED responses etc), but it rarely take more than 250 hours.  (Although, some rare complex projects going for platinmum could take up to 350 hours).  Like others, I find the norm for a reasonably complex bldg going for LEED silver or gold typically requires between 120 and 160 hours. 

Marcus  
Here's my two cents on below. I will look for the public comment period as well.  Thanks for the heads up.
I think the idea of incentivizing modeling early in the design is a great idea, but I think requiring it is completely inappropriate.  Perhaps it could be encouraged by awarding an extra (innovation? or EA cr 1?) point for starting modeling in schematic design.  Or, perhaps the credit could be restructured similar to the CX credits where in order to get the enhanced CX credits, you have to have the CX agent involved early in the design.  In some ways, the current set up already does this though with the progress points for increased levels of saving.  Quite frankly, if you are going for 50% savings, you're not gonig to get there unless you start modeling really early in the process.
  
I also think prescribing a certain minimum number of ECMs to look at is inappropriate and would probably have the adverse effect of discouraging energy modeling.  The appropriate number of ECMs is highly project dependent - based on building size, scope, complexity, type, level of LEED certification shooting for, and not least of all the owner's budget.  Let's face it, the vast majority of bldgs out there and that consume most of the energy in the US are (strip) malls, grocery stores, restaurants etc.  These projects barely event have a schematic, design and CD phase.  While we all love to work on the exotic, platinum level, cutting edge, bldgs that are likely to have a large budget for design, these are not the majority of bldgs consuming energy.  I think we should be doing more to encourage modeling and energy savings amongst the every day projects than the "sexy" projects.  It seems to me the best way to do this is to offer incentives in this direction in lieu of prescriptive requirements that could discourage/put off smaller projects from even attempting to incorporate modeling.

If anyone has any good ideas about how to structure the LEED credits to end the practice of validation models at the end and encourage/require design phase modeling the folks on the USGBC EA TAG would love to hear them.  The current proposed credit language from the first public comment phase is listed below.

 

NC, CS, SCHOOLS, RETAIL, WAREHOUSE & DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, HOSPITALITY

Establish an energy performance target no later than the schematic design phase. The target must be established as kBTU per square foot-year of source energy use. This target must be mapped on the same scale as the baseline and proposed buildings, if the project follows Option 1.

 

OPTION 1. Whole Building Energy Simulation 

Analyze a minimum of at least nine efficiency measures during the design process and account for the results in design decision-making. Analysis can include energy simulation of efficiency opportunities, application of past energy simulation analyses for similar projects to the project, or application of published data from energy analyses performed for similar projects to the project (such as AEDGs).

 

A minimum of six energy efficiency measures focused on load reduction strategies appropriate for the facility must be analyzed. This analysis must be performed during the schematic design phase.

 

A minimum of three energy efficiency measures focused on HVAC related strategies must be analyzed (passive measures are acceptable). This analysis must be performed before the conclusion of the design development phase.

 

The results of the analysis must be summarized in a brief report or memorandum.

 

 

The next version of LEED will be going out for public comment again in July, I think, so please comment formally as well as discussing here.

OK, Carol..now you threw the "bait" out there..older than dirt, eh?

 

I have done very limited LEED "type" modeling where you compare 20 walls and 40 windows types (well, it seemed that way). Correct me if I am wrong, but a Base model must be built to comply with a certain level of ASHRAE 90.1 (now up to 2010 ??). With all of the nuisances of eQuest 3.64, I am going to build the model from scrathc and put in all the relevant baseline data in by hand.  And, by the way, the ASHRAE baseline model might be an entirely different system.  I am just completing an EPACT evaluation (ASHRAE 90.1-2001) and the Baseline HVAC was screwe chillers, whereas the Actual building was packaged units with Turbocor compressors (ask me how I did that).

 

It very much depends on the complexity of the building. A 40,000 sf office or a 500,000 sf hotel with casino facilites.

 

I am unfamiliar with the LEED paperwork to be filled out after the modeling has been done. But I would not do anything of this type in under 120 hours, preferably 160 hours. If the client thinks he can do better, let him.

 

Contingency, contingency.

 

We won't discuss how old CAROL might be..

 

John A.

Marcus,

You have inadvertently hit upon why IBPSA worked with ASHRAE to create a BEMP certification. That's Building Energy Modeling Professional (BEMP). 

Some of us who have been in the field for awhile began to worry a couple of years ago when so many new energy modelers began appearing on the listserv with questions. Their questions indicated a lack of training and experience that was worrisome. What made it worrisome was that they didn't seem to realize that they were as inexperienced as they were; they didn't appear to be pursuing training to learn how to do what they were doing; and we were uncertain as to how or if they were practicing quality control. We hoped that by creating a path to certification that we would give clients one more qualification to look for in their modelers.

If you have been in this industry for any length of time, and by industry I mean the overall construction industry, you know that you don't get a lot of chances if your work doesn't pan out. If your energy model says I have a LEED Gold building and I'm going to save $4,000/year and what I really get is LEED Silver and $1,000/year, I am not going to be happy. So, I will probably not give you any more work but, even worse for all of us, I'll start expressing doubts about the whole process. LEED - what is it good for?

So, now we all have more training, right? We read our ASHRAE Handbooks and technical manuals so we know how to model the difficult stuff. We can find any topic in the DOE2 Manuals, all of which are one line, available, and easily searchable. 

So now we are so good we can do these models in 40-80 hours. Really? Not me and I've been doing it longer than everyone, except you, John Aulbach. So I'm going to join Marcus in his rant because he's on to something.

It's up to us to not under bid this work. It's up to us to educate our clients about the importance of quality in this process. If they think they are getting the same analysis in 40 hours that they used to get in 120 hours, they need to be led around to rethinking that and to be reminded that GIGO.

Cheers,

Carol

	In our experience a final model, done right, would take about 80 hours.

	 

	WARNING - frustrated modeling rant to follow:

	 

	Doing just a final model however completely misses the point as to why we model - it is to guide design decisions!  

	 

	If I saw this RFP and all it asked me for was a model to determine LEED points, during or after design, I would try to educate the potential client about the purpose of modeling.

	 

	Unfortunately too many projects pursuing LEED are only doing the minimum when it comes to modeling and almost completely missing all the benefits.  Too often the "market" transforms only based on a least first cost denominator basis that results in little real transformation.  Doing models to determine LEED points does not transform the market, save any energy, and just circumvents the purpose behind LEED. (the next version actually requires design phase modeling!)

	 

	Any "modeler" who does only final models without attempting to explain to the owner why this is a bad idea should be "drummed out of the corp" in my humble opinion.

	 

	The problem is that if you respond to this RFP with 120 or 160 or more hours to really do the design phase modeling right, you will go up against the "modeler" who claims to be able to do it in far less time.  So how do we get the folks who issue the RFPs to ask for a proper scope of work so that they can compare fees on a level playing field?  It is unfortunate that we are even having a discussion about doing modeling work in opposition to its purpose.

	 

	Sorry for the rant but I feel better now. J

	Omar,

	 

	I would expect, for a building this size, approximately 40 hours (multiply by your hourly rate). The 40 hours include EAp2/EAc1 LEED documentation, and any review you may have to respond to later.

	 

	Now, given that you have never done a LEED model, it will take you more time, possibly up to 40 more hours.

	 

	HTH,

	Greetings everyone,

	 

	I have a question regarding the cost of an energy model for a LEED project. Every energy model I've done so far has been for 

	existing buildings, mainly for optimization purposes. However, I received an RFP to model a five-story, 41,500 sq. ft. building

	that's currently on the design phase and is pursuing the LEED-NC Silver certification. I really have no idea what would be a fair 

	price for this model since I'm going to have to use Appendix G (ASHRAE 90.1) to evaluate the difference between the base 

	and proposed buildings. I don't know how much extra effort this will take. I know the procedure, just haven't done it before.

	 

	Can you shed any light on this issue?

	 

	Thanks in advance!

David - Yes.  Here are some things that I have found increase model
complexity:

1.  Building geometry.  Complex building geometry, pitched roofs, dormers,
occupied spaces in attics, etc increase model time.  Even if you simply the
model to have flat roofs, there is still time involved for you to figure out
the most appropriate way to simplify the building.

2.  Variety of space use.  Buildings that have many different space use
types contained within one shell will require additional modeling time.
 This reduces the number of zones that can be combined in order to simplify
modeling.

3.  HVAC system complexity and novelty.  Attempting to model a system that
your energy modeling program is not designed to model can be very time
consuming.

4.  Alternatives to model.  How many alternatives will you be asked to
compare?  Will you be requested to model alternatives to the HVAC system?
 Building Geometry?  Making changes to these system types is time consuming.

5.  Completeness of documents and availability of data.  How much time will
you need to spend tracking down information for your model?

The software you use will also affect the difficulty of modeling/changing
the above items.

Arpan/Omar and others, apologies for continuing to diverge on the original thread with this sub-topic!

 

Marcus and other EA TAG members, 

 

I have a few ?informal? thoughts for discussion of the draft language below? sorry for the wall of text, but I hope you?ll find this useful feedback!  

 

1.       Overall, the process described below sounds very much like our regular practice with certain clients, who are very into EUI metrics (2030 challenge).  

2.       I think the credit language should be expanded (and perhaps the onebuilding.org lists should be separately engaged) to suggest more examples of what may be appropriate studies for ?Preliminary modeling.?  Many will not be familiar with the process and be stuck for ideas of what to explore.  In my experience, such modeling most often focuses on early decisions regarding HVAC system selection, envelope materials/finishes, glazing quantity/placement/orientation, building shades (fixed and otherwise), and active/passive day lighting design.  I would note that this is often an ideal time to investigate the energy effects of landscaping on the building, as site layout tends to be locked down early in the design process? 

3.       Potential for a game-killing conflict:  A key feature of such early modeling work is that much of it is very fast and ?loose.?  The level of documentation/procedure involved in today?s EAc1/EAp2 validation models is something I?d still call ?intense,?  and still takes up a large fraction of the time spent altogether on an energy model.  I?m not new to the game, and I?ve certainly learned to streamline my workflow, but I?m sure there?s no place for *that* degree of rigorous documentation in the early stages of design.  I suspect many architects would be quick to drop the idea of engaging their energy modelers early on if they become a ?ball and chain? holding up the design process.  It would appear on this draft of the language that someone has this issue in mind,  but I wanted to vocalize this concern separately so that this doesn?t get missed!

4.       Regarding metrics: EUI, due to the 2030 challenge, is the driving force causing local architects to engage us so early on projects, and for that I have to give it props...  While metrics like EUI & Carbon footprint may be the best metric for measuring impact on polar bear habitats (?), the best metric with regard to most building owners, and their perception of the ?validity? of the whole process, is unquestionably utility bills.   I wouldn?t discourage the use of alternative metrics, but I?d caution against requiring any alternative metrics that may be at odds with the owner?s best interests...

5.       Validation models based on the construction documents (as they exist today) are not a bad thing.  They are necessary to prevent value engineering from decimating an otherwise great building towards the end of design.  I would be wary of throwing out the baby with the bathwater.  If preliminary modeling is going to be incorporated into LEED, it should start out as either as a prerequisite or as a separate credit (perhaps pulling points from the large pool available under EAc1)? not as a replacement of the validation model.  At some point in the future, they may become one and the same credit, but I think standards broader than 90.1 Appendix G will need to be written and established first, which incorporate practices and procedures for preliminary modeling (as others are saying).

6.       I LIKE the inclusion of the ability to use past studies/design.  This mirrors real-world practice and permits/encourages proven design to carry into multiple projects.  Keep that!  

7.       I LIKE the focus being on the analysis, not the decisions made.  This also reflects real-world decision making, which always balances budget and other constraints against relative energy impact.

8.       Julia?s concern regarding prescribing a set # of studies/analyses is pertinent and deserves consideration.  Not all projects require a huge investment of time in preliminary studies, and not all projects would benefit? then again, these sorts of studies sometimes cause design teams to learn something they didn?t set out to explore.   The bar has to be set somewhere, and I can?t think of a better alternative than a minimum number of studies/iterations per building area (envelope/glazing/HVAC options, etc?).

 

To the broader concern of inefficient strip mall/prototype projects ? I?d agree LEED likely isn?t the tool to reign that issue in?  Developers award this sort of work to design teams who are fast and efficient at cranking out a design that will pass review and minimize first costs/CA.  They don?t budget for weeks on quality energy modeling.  The only effective tools to drive down such ?fire-and-forget? projects are the prescriptive energy codes, and their effective/actual enforcement by local reviewers.  Those codes and their adoption/enforcement drive the market to produce better products at an economical price point.

 

Hope that helps!

 

~Nick

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Energy Model Cost

 

Omar,
This is cracking me up.  I don't think I've ever seen this much traffic on one issue!  LOL.
Regarding the manhours for a LEED model - my opinion is that the amount of time has much more to do with the level of certification the project is going for, at what point the modeling services are engaged in the design, and the type and complexity of the building (systems).  That's not to say the number of manhours is completely independent of building size (square footage), but its not particularly sensitive to it.  I find that that there is a high "low" and low "high" for modeling.  In other words, it's hard to complete an energy model in less than 60-80 hours (all said and done - paperwork, LEED responses etc), but it rarely take more than 250 hours.  (Although, some rare complex projects going for platinmum could take up to 350 hours).  Like others, I find the norm for a reasonably complex bldg going for LEED silver or gold typically requires between 120 and 160 hours. 

Marcus  
Here's my two cents on below. I will look for the public comment period as well.  Thanks for the heads up.
I think the idea of incentivizing modeling early in the design is a great idea, but I think requiring it is completely inappropriate.  Perhaps it could be encouraged by awarding an extra (innovation? or EA cr 1?) point for starting modeling in schematic design.  Or, perhaps the credit could be restructured similar to the CX credits where in order to get the enhanced CX credits, you have to have the CX agent involved early in the design.  In some ways, the current set up already does this though with the progress points for increased levels of saving.  Quite frankly, if you are going for 50% savings, you're not gonig to get there unless you start modeling really early in the process.
  
I also think prescribing a certain minimum number of ECMs to look at is inappropriate and would probably have the adverse effect of discouraging energy modeling.  The appropriate number of ECMs is highly project dependent - based on building size, scope, complexity, type, level of LEED certification shooting for, and not least of all the owner's budget.  Let's face it, the vast majority of bldgs out there and that consume most of the energy in the US are (strip) malls, grocery stores, restaurants etc.  These projects barely event have a schematic, design and CD phase.  While we all love to work on the exotic, platinum level, cutting edge, bldgs that are likely to have a large budget for design, these are not the majority of bldgs consuming energy.  I think we should be doing more to encourage modeling and energy savings amongst the every day projects than the "sexy" projects.  It seems to me the best way to do this is to offer incentives in this direction in lieu of prescriptive requirements that could discourage/put off smaller projects from even attempting to incorporate modeling.

If anyone has any good ideas about how to structure the LEED credits to end the practice of validation models at the end and encourage/require design phase modeling the folks on the USGBC EA TAG would love to hear them.  The current proposed credit language from the first public comment phase is listed below.

 

NC, CS, SCHOOLS, RETAIL, WAREHOUSE & DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, HOSPITALITY

Establish an energy performance target no later than the schematic design phase. The target must be established as kBTU per square foot-year of source energy use. This target must be mapped on the same scale as the baseline and proposed buildings, if the project follows Option 1.

 

OPTION 1. Whole Building Energy Simulation 

Analyze a minimum of at least nine efficiency measures during the design process and account for the results in design decision-making. Analysis can include energy simulation of efficiency opportunities, application of past energy simulation analyses for similar projects to the project, or application of published data from energy analyses performed for similar projects to the project (such as AEDGs).

 

A minimum of six energy efficiency measures focused on load reduction strategies appropriate for the facility must be analyzed. This analysis must be performed during the schematic design phase.

 

A minimum of three energy efficiency measures focused on HVAC related strategies must be analyzed (passive measures are acceptable). This analysis must be performed before the conclusion of the design development phase.

 

The results of the analysis must be summarized in a brief report or memorandum.

 

 

The next version of LEED will be going out for public comment again in July, I think, so please comment formally as well as discussing here.

OK, Carol..now you threw the "bait" out there..older than dirt, eh?

 

I have done very limited LEED "type" modeling where you compare 20 walls and 40 windows types (well, it seemed that way). Correct me if I am wrong, but a Base model must be built to comply with a certain level of ASHRAE 90.1 (now up to 2010 ??). With all of the nuisances of eQuest 3.64, I am going to build the model from scrathc and put in all the relevant baseline data in by hand.  And, by the way, the ASHRAE baseline model might be an entirely different system.  I am just completing an EPACT evaluation (ASHRAE 90.1-2001) and the Baseline HVAC was screwe chillers, whereas the Actual building was packaged units with Turbocor compressors (ask me how I did that).

 

It very much depends on the complexity of the building. A 40,000 sf office or a 500,000 sf hotel with casino facilites.

 

I am unfamiliar with the LEED paperwork to be filled out after the modeling has been done. But I would not do anything of this type in under 120 hours, preferably 160 hours. If the client thinks he can do better, let him.

 

Contingency, contingency.

 

We won't discuss how old CAROL might be..

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Energy Model Cost

Marcus,

You have inadvertently hit upon why IBPSA worked with ASHRAE to create a BEMP certification. That's Building Energy Modeling Professional (BEMP). 

Some of us who have been in the field for awhile began to worry a couple of years ago when so many new energy modelers began appearing on the listserv with questions. Their questions indicated a lack of training and experience that was worrisome. What made it worrisome was that they didn't seem to realize that they were as inexperienced as they were; they didn't appear to be pursuing training to learn how to do what they were doing; and we were uncertain as to how or if they were practicing quality control. We hoped that by creating a path to certification that we would give clients one more qualification to look for in their modelers.

If you have been in this industry for any length of time, and by industry I mean the overall construction industry, you know that you don't get a lot of chances if your work doesn't pan out. If your energy model says I have a LEED Gold building and I'm going to save $4,000/year and what I really get is LEED Silver and $1,000/year, I am not going to be happy. So, I will probably not give you any more work but, even worse for all of us, I'll start expressing doubts about the whole process. LEED - what is it good for?

So, now we all have more training, right? We read our ASHRAE Handbooks and technical manuals so we know how to model the difficult stuff. We can find any topic in the DOE2 Manuals, all of which are one line, available, and easily searchable. 

So now we are so good we can do these models in 40-80 hours. Really? Not me and I've been doing it longer than everyone, except you, John Aulbach. So I'm going to join Marcus in his rant because he's on to something.

It's up to us to not under bid this work. It's up to us to educate our clients about the importance of quality in this process. If they think they are getting the same analysis in 40 hours that they used to get in 120 hours, they need to be led around to rethinking that and to be reminded that GIGO.

Cheers,

Carol

	In our experience a final model, done right, would take about 80 hours.

	 

	WARNING ? frustrated modeling rant to follow:

	 

	Doing just a final model however completely misses the point as to why we model ? it is to guide design decisions!  

	 

	If I saw this RFP and all it asked me for was a model to determine LEED points, during or after design, I would try to educate the potential client about the purpose of modeling.

	 

	Unfortunately too many projects pursuing LEED are only doing the minimum when it comes to modeling and almost completely missing all the benefits.  Too often the ?market? transforms only based on a least first cost denominator basis that results in little real transformation.  Doing models to determine LEED points does not transform the market, save any energy, and just circumvents the purpose behind LEED. (the next version actually requires design phase modeling!)

	 

	Any ?modeler? who does only final models without attempting to explain to the owner why this is a bad idea should be ?drummed out of the corp? in my humble opinion.

	 

	The problem is that if you respond to this RFP with 120 or 160 or more hours to really do the design phase modeling right, you will go up against the ?modeler? who claims to be able to do it in far less time.  So how do we get the folks who issue the RFPs to ask for a proper scope of work so that they can compare fees on a level playing field?  It is unfortunate that we are even having a discussion about doing modeling work in opposition to its purpose.

	 

	Sorry for the rant but I feel better now. J

	Omar,

	 

	I would expect, for a building this size, approximately 40 hours (multiply by your hourly rate). The 40 hours include EAp2/EAc1 LEED documentation, and any review you may have to respond to later.

	 

	Now, given that you have never done a LEED model, it will take you more time, possibly up to 40 more hours.

	 

	HTH,

	Greetings everyone,

	 

	I have a question regarding the cost of an energy model for a LEED project. Every energy model I've done so far has been for 

	existing buildings, mainly for optimization purposes. However, I received an RFP to model a five-story, 41,500 sq. ft. building

	that's currently on the design phase and is pursuing the LEED-NC Silver certification. I really have no idea what would be a fair 

	price for this model since I'm going to have to use Appendix G (ASHRAE 90.1) to evaluate the difference between the base 

	and proposed buildings. I don't know how much extra effort this will take. I know the procedure, just haven't done it before.

	 

	Can you shed any light on this issue?

	 

	Thanks in advance!

I have been thinking about trying to establish a new 
standard at ASHRAE that I tentatively titled:

"Simulation Aided Design for High Performance Buildings"

The new standard, once deveoped, could be referenced by 
USGBC and other organizations. The concept is similar to the 
direction that USGBC is considering. Attached is a draft 
describing the concept. I think having a group of practicing 
simulation consultants would be key to making such a 
standard usable and adopted.

Please let me know if you have any comments and if you would 
be interested in participating in developing a new standard. 
If I have enough interest, I will submit the necessary 
paperwork to ASHRAE to get this considered.

Thanks

Jason

All:

Very interesting discussion. I think folks can agree that the US Energy Modeling Services market, snapshot today, can be best characterized as an immature and evolving market - in my opinion, it certainly doesn't fit the description of a commodity service (I see many potential 'customers' searching for the lowest cost'  with little understanding of what they are purchasing) and I have mixed feeling about driving the industry towards commodity services.  It's the path to scale, which we all want, but if not carefully crafted, will lead to more market confusion and poor quality - no one wins.  LEED has played a significant role in creating a market for these services, but, IMHO, it can only 'regulate the market' so far - at some point innovation (people/product/process) needs to carry the market to the next step. Perhaps a better management of expectations between stakeholders would be an improvement..?

Although it is a relatively 'old' document, I attach it here for sharing.  At every energy modeling training I conduct, I give away this document and emphasize its usefulness.


1)      it's a DOE FEMP publication  so it carries branding and credibility WAY beyond me/my firm.

2)      There's a lot of good strong 'fundamental' PROCESS information for client education buried in this document

Relevant to this discussion, see .pdf pages 31-32 (of 36)..   "Determining Costs and Fees" - I think you will find it an interesting read!

All the Best,

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Energy Model Cost

David - Yes.  Here are some things that I have found increase model complexity:

1.  Building geometry.  Complex building geometry, pitched roofs, dormers, occupied spaces in attics, etc increase model time.  Even if you simply the model to have flat roofs, there is still time involved for you to figure out the most appropriate way to simplify the building.

2.  Variety of space use.  Buildings that have many different space use types contained within one shell will require additional modeling time.  This reduces the number of zones that can be combined in order to simplify modeling.

3.  HVAC system complexity and novelty.  Attempting to model a system that your energy modeling program is not designed to model can be very time consuming.

4.  Alternatives to model.  How many alternatives will you be asked to compare?  Will you be requested to model alternatives to the HVAC system?  Building Geometry?  Making changes to these system types is time consuming.

5.  Completeness of documents and availability of data.  How much time will you need to spend tracking down information for your model?

The software you use will also affect the difficulty of modeling/changing the above items.

Omar,
This is cracking me up.  I don't think I've ever seen this much traffic on one issue!  LOL.
Regarding the manhours for a LEED model - my opinion is that the amount of time has much more to do with the level of certification the project is going for, at what point the modeling services are engaged in the design, and the type and complexity of the building (systems).  That's not to say the number of manhours is completely independent of building size (square footage), but its not particularly sensitive to it.  I find that that there is a high "low" and low "high" for modeling.  In other words, it's hard to complete an energy model in less than 60-80 hours (all said and done - paperwork, LEED responses etc), but it rarely take more than 250 hours.  (Although, some rare complex projects going for platinmum could take up to 350 hours).  Like others, I find the norm for a reasonably complex bldg going for LEED silver or gold typically requires between 120 and 160 hours.

Marcus
Here's my two cents on below. I will look for the public comment period as well.  Thanks for the heads up.
I think the idea of incentivizing modeling early in the design is a great idea, but I think requiring it is completely inappropriate.  Perhaps it could be encouraged by awarding an extra (innovation? or EA cr 1?) point for starting modeling in schematic design.  Or, perhaps the credit could be restructured similar to the CX credits where in order to get the enhanced CX credits, you have to have the CX agent involved early in the design.  In some ways, the current set up already does this though with the progress points for increased levels of saving.  Quite frankly, if you are going for 50% savings, you're not gonig to get there unless you start modeling really early in the process.

I also think prescribing a certain minimum number of ECMs to look at is inappropriate and would probably have the adverse effect of discouraging energy modeling.  The appropriate number of ECMs is highly project dependent - based on building size, scope, complexity, type, level of LEED certification shooting for, and not least of all the owner's budget.  Let's face it, the vast majority of bldgs out there and that consume most of the energy in the US are (strip) malls, grocery stores, restaurants etc.  These projects barely event have a schematic, design and CD phase.  While we all love to work on the exotic, platinum level, cutting edge, bldgs that are likely to have a large budget for design, these are not the majority of bldgs consuming energy.  I think we should be doing more to encourage modeling and energy savings amongst the every day projects than the "sexy" projects.  It seems to me the best way to do this is to offer incentives in this direction in lieu of prescriptive requirements that could discourage/put off smaller projects from even attempting to incorporate modeling.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Energy Model Cost

If anyone has any good ideas about how to structure the LEED credits to end the practice of validation models at the end and encourage/require design phase modeling the folks on the USGBC EA TAG would love to hear them.  The current proposed credit language from the first public comment phase is listed below.

NC, CS, SCHOOLS, RETAIL, WAREHOUSE & DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, HOSPITALITY
Establish an energy performance target no later than the schematic design phase. The target must be established as kBTU per square foot-year of source energy use. This target must be mapped on the same scale as the baseline and proposed buildings, if the project follows Option 1.

OPTION 1. Whole Building Energy Simulation
Analyze a minimum of at least nine efficiency measures during the design process and account for the results in design decision-making. Analysis can include energy simulation of efficiency opportunities, application of past energy simulation analyses for similar projects to the project, or application of published data from energy analyses performed for similar projects to the project (such as AEDGs).

A minimum of six energy efficiency measures focused on load reduction strategies appropriate for the facility must be analyzed. This analysis must be performed during the schematic design phase.

A minimum of three energy efficiency measures focused on HVAC related strategies must be analyzed (passive measures are acceptable). This analysis must be performed before the conclusion of the design development phase.

The results of the analysis must be summarized in a brief report or memorandum.


The next version of LEED will be going out for public comment again in July, I think, so please comment formally as well as discussing here.

OK, Carol..now you threw the "bait" out there..older than dirt, eh?

I have done very limited LEED "type" modeling where you compare 20 walls and 40 windows types (well, it seemed that way). Correct me if I am wrong, but a Base model must be built to comply with a certain level of ASHRAE 90.1 (now up to 2010 ??). With all of the nuisances of eQuest 3.64, I am going to build the model from scrathc and put in all the relevant baseline data in by hand.  And, by the way, the ASHRAE baseline model might be an entirely different system.  I am just completing an EPACT evaluation (ASHRAE 90.1-2001) and the Baseline HVAC was screwe chillers, whereas the Actual building was packaged units with Turbocor compressors (ask me how I did that).

It very much depends on the complexity of the building. A 40,000 sf office or a 500,000 sf hotel with casino facilites.

I am unfamiliar with the LEED paperwork to be filled out after the modeling has been done. But I would not do anything of this type in under 120 hours, preferably 160 hours. If the client thinks he can do better, let him.

Contingency, contingency.

We won't discuss how old CAROL might be..

John A.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Energy Model Cost

Marcus,

You have inadvertently hit upon why IBPSA worked with ASHRAE to create a BEMP certification. That's Building Energy Modeling Professional (BEMP).

Some of us who have been in the field for awhile began to worry a couple of years ago when so many new energy modelers began appearing on the listserv with questions. Their questions indicated a lack of training and experience that was worrisome. What made it worrisome was that they didn't seem to realize that they were as inexperienced as they were; they didn't appear to be pursuing training to learn how to do what they were doing; and we were uncertain as to how or if they were practicing quality control. We hoped that by creating a path to certification that we would give clients one more qualification to look for in their modelers.

If you have been in this industry for any length of time, and by industry I mean the overall construction industry, you know that you don't get a lot of chances if your work doesn't pan out. If your energy model says I have a LEED Gold building and I'm going to save $4,000/year and what I really get is LEED Silver and $1,000/year, I am not going to be happy. So, I will probably not give you any more work but, even worse for all of us, I'll start expressing doubts about the whole process. LEED - what is it good for?

So, now we all have more training, right? We read our ASHRAE Handbooks and technical manuals so we know how to model the difficult stuff. We can find any topic in the DOE2 Manuals, all of which are one line, available, and easily searchable.

So now we are so good we can do these models in 40-80 hours. Really? Not me and I've been doing it longer than everyone, except you, John Aulbach. So I'm going to join Marcus in his rant because he's on to something.

It's up to us to not under bid this work. It's up to us to educate our clients about the importance of quality in this process. If they think they are getting the same analysis in 40 hours that they used to get in 120 hours, they need to be led around to rethinking that and to be reminded that GIGO.

Cheers,

Carol

In our experience a final model, done right, would take about 80 hours.

WARNING - frustrated modeling rant to follow:

Doing just a final model however completely misses the point as to why we model - it is to guide design decisions!

If I saw this RFP and all it asked me for was a model to determine LEED points, during or after design, I would try to educate the potential client about the purpose of modeling.

Unfortunately too many projects pursuing LEED are only doing the minimum when it comes to modeling and almost completely missing all the benefits.  Too often the "market" transforms only based on a least first cost denominator basis that results in little real transformation.  Doing models to determine LEED points does not transform the market, save any energy, and just circumvents the purpose behind LEED. (the next version actually requires design phase modeling!)

Any "modeler" who does only final models without attempting to explain to the owner why this is a bad idea should be "drummed out of the corp" in my humble opinion.

The problem is that if you respond to this RFP with 120 or 160 or more hours to really do the design phase modeling right, you will go up against the "modeler" who claims to be able to do it in far less time.  So how do we get the folks who issue the RFPs to ask for a proper scope of work so that they can compare fees on a level playing field?  It is unfortunate that we are even having a discussion about doing modeling work in opposition to its purpose.

Sorry for the rant but I feel better now. :)

Omar,

I would expect, for a building this size, approximately 40 hours (multiply by your hourly rate). The 40 hours include EAp2/EAc1 LEED documentation, and any review you may have to respond to later.

Now, given that you have never done a LEED model, it will take you more time, possibly up to 40 more hours.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Energy Model Cost

Greetings everyone,

I have a question regarding the cost of an energy model for a LEED project. Every energy model I've done so far has been for
existing buildings, mainly for optimization purposes. However, I received an RFP to model a five-story, 41,500 sq. ft. building
that's currently on the design phase and is pursuing the LEED-NC Silver certification. I really have no idea what would be a fair
price for this model since I'm going to have to use Appendix G (ASHRAE 90.1) to evaluate the difference between the base
and proposed buildings. I don't know how much extra effort this will take. I know the procedure, just haven't done it before.

Can you shed any light on this issue?

Thanks in advance!

As a member of the ASHRAE 189.1 committee (standard for high performance 
bldgs).  would it be better to incorporate this type of thing into that rather 
than starting from scratch?  Or, perhaps the std you are talking about could 
ultimately get referenced into Std 189.1.  Currently, we just switched to 
referencing 90.1 App G.  There's a number of modelers on the committee.  One of 
the concerns is trying to minimize the number of protocols a modeler would have 
to potentially comply with.  Hopefully, these things would ultimately converge.

Thoughts Molly?

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Energy Model Cost

I have been thinking about trying to establish a new 
standard at ASHRAE that I tentatively titled:

"Simulation Aided Design for High Performance Buildings"

The new standard, once deveoped, could be referenced by 
USGBC and other organizations. The concept is similar to the 
direction that USGBC is considering. Attached is a draft 
describing the concept. I think having a group of practicing 
simulation consultants would be key to making such a 
standard usable and adopted.

Please let me know if you have any comments and if you would 
be interested in participating in developing a new standard. 
If I have enough interest, I will submit the necessary 
paperwork to ASHRAE to get this considered.

Thanks

Jason

Hi,

I propose a standard on ?intelligent building control? comprising anticipating simulation (forecasting, nowcasting..) 

cheers

As a member of the ASHRAE 189.1 committee (standard for high performance bldgs).  would it be better to incorporate this type of thing into that rather than starting from scratch?  Or, perhaps the std you are talking about could ultimately get referenced into Std 189.1.  Currently, we just switched to referencing 90.1 App G.  There's a number of modelers on the committee.  One of the concerns is trying to minimize the number of protocols a modeler would have to potentially comply with.  Hopefully, these things would ultimately converge.

Thoughts Molly?

I have been thinking about trying to establish a new 
standard at ASHRAE that I tentatively titled:

"Simulation Aided Design for High Performance Buildings"

The new standard, once deveoped, could be referenced by 
USGBC and other organizations. The concept is similar to the 
direction that USGBC is considering. Attached is a draft 
describing the concept. I think having a group of practicing 
simulation consultants would be key to making such a 
standard usable and adopted.

Please let me know if you have any comments and if you would 
be interested in participating in developing a new standard. 
If I have enough interest, I will submit the necessary 
paperwork to ASHRAE to get this considered.

Thanks

Jason

Hi Jason,
could you elaborate a little more on your vision.  
From the write up, it sounds to me like you're talking more about establishing a 
modeling process protocol - yes?
It also describes ASHREA 90.1 and 189.1 as being prescriptive approaches.  But, 
both those documents have the alternative (app G) performance based approach 
too.  As we all know, this established modeling rules and the parameters for 
your baseline building etc, but doesn't mandate a certain modeling process (i.e. 
when modeling starts in the design, options to be considered etc).
So, do you see your proposed standard as supplementing those in terms of 
establishing a modeling process protocol?  Or, would your standard also 
establish modeling rules and baseline building parameters like App G?

Julia

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Energy Model Cost

I have been thinking about trying to establish a new 
standard at ASHRAE that I tentatively titled:

"Simulation Aided Design for High Performance Buildings"

The new standard, once deveoped, could be referenced by 
USGBC and other organizations. The concept is similar to the 
direction that USGBC is considering. Attached is a draft 
describing the concept. I think having a group of practicing 
simulation consultants would be key to making such a 
standard usable and adopted.

Please let me know if you have any comments and if you would 
be interested in participating in developing a new standard. 
If I have enough interest, I will submit the necessary 
paperwork to ASHRAE to get this considered.

Thanks

Jason

Julia,

What I am suggesting has to do with the process of designing 
a building using simulation during each step of the process. 
It is not about establishing baseline and determining a 
percentage savings, Appendix G does that already. I would 
hope that both 90.1 Appendix G and this new standard would 
be referenced, G for establishing a measurement and the new 
standard for establishing a process.

Jason. 

I'd suggest you think about an ASHRAE protocol, or Guideline first, then a standard. I also think IBPSA/USA could easily get behind this. I'd be happy to be a part of the group.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Energy Model Cost

I have been thinking about trying to establish a new 
standard at ASHRAE that I tentatively titled:

"Simulation Aided Design for High Performance Buildings"

The new standard, once deveoped, could be referenced by 
USGBC and other organizations. The concept is similar to the 
direction that USGBC is considering. Attached is a draft 
describing the concept. I think having a group of practicing 
simulation consultants would be key to making such a 
standard usable and adopted.

Please let me know if you have any comments and if you would 
be interested in participating in developing a new standard. 
If I have enough interest, I will submit the necessary 
paperwork to ASHRAE to get this considered.

Thanks

Jason

Arpan. 

This is Exactly the place to start, and then add specifics with example input files that could be run by the user. Making this an ASHRAE/IBPSA project would then allow help from ASHRAE staff.

Any reason these efforts cannot be merged with BEMbook? I feel the community really wants something like BEMbook as soon as possible.

	I'd suggest you think about an ASHRAE protocol, or Guideline first, then a standard. I also think IBPSA/USA could easily get behind this. I'd be happy to be a part of the group.

	I have been thinking about trying to establish a new
	standard at ASHRAE that I tentatively titled:
	
	"Simulation Aided Design for High Performance Buildings"
	
	The new standard, once deveoped, could be referenced by
	USGBC and other organizations. The concept is similar to the
	direction that USGBC is considering. Attached is a draft
	describing the concept. I think having a group of practicing
	simulation consultants would be key to making such a
	standard usable and adopted.
	
	Please let me know if you have any comments and if you would
	be interested in participating in developing a new standard.
	If I have enough interest, I will submit the necessary
	paperwork to ASHRAE to get this considered.
	
	Thanks
	
	Jason

Jason,

Count me in. I think you are correct to make this a new effort and not
attach it to current work in progress. Not that the current work in progress
isn't great. It is. This standard needs to get at issues that aren't
included in
Standard 90 and 189, though. I think I'd call them process issues. Things
like how can you uphold your client's valid interest to save money, focusing
on $/sf, while also upholding the worlds critical need to save energy,
focusing on kBtu/sf/yr. There are many more, of course, but I don't have
time to climb up on my soap box today - maybe later....

Carol

PS John, I am as old as dirt. You, however, were here before dirt was
invented. That must make you a sapling, Nick.

Could any one advice why LEED would not put the base design as Watt per square foot, or per occupant, or per hotel bed etc. so the Architecture becomes more innovative early in the design to save energy?

Arpan,

 

Based on the Weidt Group paper, I?m guessing you?re emphasizing architectural considerations that affect the energy cost vs. LEED points numbers. (The paper uses window-to-wall ratios and daylighting as an example.) I would think the goal during the programming and schematic design phases should be energy cost, not LEED points relative to the App. G baseline. Much of the energy cost savings vs. App. G baseline (EAc1 points) is going to come later from the mechanical and lighting designs. The suggestions in the paper to establish specific baseline building shapes and glazing percentages would add a LOT more modeling time ? you?d have to create two separate building geometries for the baseline and proposed models, not to mention different zoning patterns, space types, lighting power per space etc.

 

For mechanical design, once the size and programming of the project is established, the baseline model properties are pretty well set, unless you consider fuel-switching and go between baseline systems 1/3/5/7 to systems 2/4/6/8. One exception I can think of for a design decision that results in higher energy cost but better comparison with the App. G baseline is higher ventilation rates combined with heat recovery in the proposed and no heat recovery in the baseline.

 

Regards,

Bill

Marcus, thank you incorporating this language.

 

The one scenario we often see in our design guidance work is that a proposed design when compared with other design alternates does not necessarily provided the largest energy savings when compared against its own baseline case model. It is difficult to make a recommendation as consultants when we want to present the Owner with both real energy cost savings without compromising their LEED certification level targets.  

A recent paper presented by the Weidt Group at SimBuild touched on this issue:

If anyone has any good ideas about how to structure the LEED credits to end the practice of validation models at the end and encourage/require design phase modeling the folks on the USGBC EA TAG would love to hear them.  The current proposed credit language from the first public comment phase is listed below.

 

NC, CS, SCHOOLS, RETAIL, WAREHOUSE & DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, HOSPITALITY

Establish an energy performance target no later than the schematic design phase. The target must be established as kBTU per square foot-year of source energy use. This target must be mapped on the same scale as the baseline and proposed buildings, if the project follows Option 1.

 

OPTION 1. Whole Building Energy Simulation 

Analyze a minimum of at least nine efficiency measures during the design process and account for the results in design decision-making. Analysis can include energy simulation of efficiency opportunities, application of past energy simulation analyses for similar projects to the project, or application of published data from energy analyses performed for similar projects to the project (such as AEDGs).

 

A minimum of six energy efficiency measures focused on load reduction strategies appropriate for the facility must be analyzed. This analysis must be performed during the schematic design phase.

 

A minimum of three energy efficiency measures focused on HVAC related strategies must be analyzed (passive measures are acceptable). This analysis must be performed before the conclusion of the design development phase.

 

The results of the analysis must be summarized in a brief report or memorandum.

 

 

The next version of LEED will be going out for public comment again in July, I think, so please comment formally as well as discussing here.

OK, Carol..now you threw the "bait" out there..older than dirt, eh?

 

I have done very limited LEED "type" modeling where you compare 20 walls and 40 windows types (well, it seemed that way). Correct me if I am wrong, but a Base model must be built to comply with a certain level of ASHRAE 90.1 (now up to 2010 ??). With all of the nuisances of eQuest 3.64, I am going to build the model from scrathc and put in all the relevant baseline data in by hand.  And, by the way, the ASHRAE baseline model might be an entirely different system.  I am just completing an EPACT evaluation (ASHRAE 90.1-2001) and the Baseline HVAC was screwe chillers, whereas the Actual building was packaged units with Turbocor compressors (ask me how I did that).

 

It very much depends on the complexity of the building. A 40,000 sf office or a 500,000 sf hotel with casino facilites.

 

I am unfamiliar with the LEED paperwork to be filled out after the modeling has been done. But I would not do anything of this type in under 120 hours, preferably 160 hours. If the client thinks he can do better, let him.

 

Contingency, contingency.

 

We won't discuss how old CAROL might be..

Marcus,

You have inadvertently hit upon why IBPSA worked with ASHRAE to create a BEMP certification. That's Building Energy Modeling Professional (BEMP). 

Some of us who have been in the field for awhile began to worry a couple of years ago when so many new energy modelers began appearing on the listserv with questions. Their questions indicated a lack of training and experience that was worrisome. What made it worrisome was that they didn't seem to realize that they were as inexperienced as they were; they didn't appear to be pursuing training to learn how to do what they were doing; and we were uncertain as to how or if they were practicing quality control. We hoped that by creating a path to certification that we would give clients one more qualification to look for in their modelers.

If you have been in this industry for any length of time, and by industry I mean the overall construction industry, you know that you don't get a lot of chances if your work doesn't pan out. If your energy model says I have a LEED Gold building and I'm going to save $4,000/year and what I really get is LEED Silver and $1,000/year, I am not going to be happy. So, I will probably not give you any more work but, even worse for all of us, I'll start expressing doubts about the whole process. LEED - what is it good for?

So, now we all have more training, right? We read our ASHRAE Handbooks and technical manuals so we know how to model the difficult stuff. We can find any topic in the DOE2 Manuals, all of which are one line, available, and easily searchable. 

So now we are so good we can do these models in 40-80 hours. Really? Not me and I've been doing it longer than everyone, except you, John Aulbach. So I'm going to join Marcus in his rant because he's on to something.

It's up to us to not under bid this work. It's up to us to educate our clients about the importance of quality in this process. If they think they are getting the same analysis in 40 hours that they used to get in 120 hours, they need to be led around to rethinking that and to be reminded that GIGO.

Cheers,

Carol

In our experience a final model, done right, would take about 80 hours.

 

WARNING ? frustrated modeling rant to follow:

 

Doing just a final model however completely misses the point as to why we model ? it is to guide design decisions!  

 

If I saw this RFP and all it asked me for was a model to determine LEED points, during or after design, I would try to educate the potential client about the purpose of modeling.

 

Unfortunately too many projects pursuing LEED are only doing the minimum when it comes to modeling and almost completely missing all the benefits.  Too often the ?market? transforms only based on a least first cost denominator basis that results in little real transformation.  Doing models to determine LEED points does not transform the market, save any energy, and just circumvents the purpose behind LEED. (the next version actually requires design phase modeling!)

 

Any ?modeler? who does only final models without attempting to explain to the owner why this is a bad idea should be ?drummed out of the corp? in my humble opinion.

 

The problem is that if you respond to this RFP with 120 or 160 or more hours to really do the design phase modeling right, you will go up against the ?modeler? who claims to be able to do it in far less time.  So how do we get the folks who issue the RFPs to ask for a proper scope of work so that they can compare fees on a level playing field?  It is unfortunate that we are even having a discussion about doing modeling work in opposition to its purpose.

 

Sorry for the rant but I feel better now. J

Omar,

 

I would expect, for a building this size, approximately 40 hours (multiply by your hourly rate). The 40 hours include EAp2/EAc1 LEED documentation, and any review you may have to respond to later.

 

Now, given that you have never done a LEED model, it will take you more time, possibly up to 40 more hours.

Greetings everyone,

 

I have a question regarding the cost of an energy model for a LEED project. Every energy model I've done so far has been for 

existing buildings, mainly for optimization purposes. However, I received an RFP to model a five-story, 41,500 sq. ft. building

that's currently on the design phase and is pursuing the LEED-NC Silver certification. I really have no idea what would be a fair 

price for this model since I'm going to have to use Appendix G (ASHRAE 90.1) to evaluate the difference between the base 

and proposed buildings. I don't know how much extra effort this will take. I know the procedure, just haven't done it before.

 

Can you shed any light on this issue?

 

Thanks in advance!

Not to be a jerk, but to ask an honest question: what is the point?  I?ve been involved with ?established energy target? projects and never really picked up on the logic behind it ? I would appreciate a layman?s explanation.

 

Put another way:  If you select an arbitrary EUI or watts per square foot at the earliest stages of design, what have you gained in design process?  If/when a project ?meets the goal? mid-design, are future design decisions supposed to de-emphasize energy impact (no!)?  If on the other hand, a project finds that target unreasonable down the road, what then?  

 

Not setting a mile-marker like this implies designing the best building you can given the time/budget available and any other constraints? that seems more likely to result in the best end-result to me.

 

To draw analogy, if design of a LEED (or any energy-conscious) project is like planning a road trip from Kansas to Florida, setting EUI goals seems something like choosing a rest stop by throwing a dart at the map blindfolded.  It doesn?t help you get to your destination any more efficiently, it may be far out of the way, and now you?ve got a hole in the wall? what was the point?

 

Okay, maybe a weak analogy ? chalking it up to a very long week =).  Honestly, I?d appreciate someone laying the value behind this approach ? I?m expect the logic does exist, and I just haven?t yet seen the light!

One exception I can think of for a design decision that results in higher energy cost but better comparison with the App. G baseline is higher ventilation rates combined with heat recovery in the proposed and no heat recovery in the baseline.

	OK, Carol..now you threw the "bait" out there..older than dirt, eh?

	 

	I have done very limited LEED "type" modeling where you compare 20 walls and 40 windows types (well, it seemed that way). Correct me if I am wrong, but a Base model must be built to comply with a certain level of ASHRAE 90.1 (now up to 2010 ??). With all of the nuisances of eQuest 3.64, I am going to build the model from scrathc and put in all the relevant baseline data in by hand.  And, by the way, the ASHRAE baseline model might be an entirely different system.  I am just completing an EPACT evaluation (ASHRAE 90.1-2001) and the Baseline HVAC was screwe chillers, whereas the Actual building was packaged units with Turbocor compressors (ask me how I did that).

	 

	It very much depends on the complexity of the building. A 40,000 sf office or a 500,000 sf hotel with casino facilites.

	 

	I am unfamiliar with the LEED paperwork to be filled out after the modeling has been done. But I would not do anything of this type in under 120 hours, preferably 160 hours. If the client thinks he can do better, let him.

	 

	Contingency, contingency.

	 

	We won't discuss how old CAROL might be..

	Marcus,
	
	You have inadvertently hit upon why IBPSA worked with ASHRAE to create a BEMP certification. That's Building Energy Modeling Professional (BEMP). 
	
	Some of us who have been in the field for awhile began to worry a couple of years ago when so many new energy modelers began appearing on the listserv with questions. Their questions indicated a lack of training and experience that was worrisome. What made it worrisome was that they didn't seem to realize that they were as inexperienced as they were; they didn't appear to be pursuing training to learn how to do what they were doing; and we were uncertain as to how or if they were practicing quality control. We hoped that by creating a path to certification that we would give clients one more qualification to look for in their modelers.
	
	If you have been in this industry for any length of time, and by industry I mean the overall construction industry, you know that you don't get a lot of chances if your work doesn't pan out. If your energy model says I have a LEED Gold building and I'm going to save $4,000/year and what I really get is LEED Silver and $1,000/year, I am not going to be happy. So, I will probably not give you any more work but, even worse for all of us, I'll start expressing doubts about the whole process. LEED - what is it good for?
	
	So, now we all have more training, right? We read our ASHRAE Handbooks and technical manuals so we know how to model the difficult stuff. We can find any topic in the DOE2 Manuals, all of which are one line, available, and easily searchable. 
	
	So now we are so good we can do these models in 40-80 hours. Really? Not me and I've been doing it longer than everyone, except you, John Aulbach. So I'm going to join Marcus in his rant because he's on to something.
	
	It's up to us to not under bid this work. It's up to us to educate our clients about the importance of quality in this process. If they think they are getting the same analysis in 40 hours that they used to get in 120 hours, they need to be led around to rethinking that and to be reminded that GIGO.
	
	Cheers,
	
	Carol

		In our experience a final model, done right, would take about 80 hours.

		 

		WARNING ? frustrated modeling rant to follow:

		 

		Doing just a final model however completely misses the point as to why we model ? it is to guide design decisions!  

		 

		If I saw this RFP and all it asked me for was a model to determine LEED points, during or after design, I would try to educate the potential client about the purpose of modeling.

		 

		Unfortunately too many projects pursuing LEED are only doing the minimum when it comes to modeling and almost completely missing all the benefits.  Too often the ?market? transforms only based on a least first cost denominator basis that results in little real transformation.  Doing models to determine LEED points does not transform the market, save any energy, and just circumvents the purpose behind LEED. (the next version actually requires design phase modeling!)

		 

		Any ?modeler? who does only final models without attempting to explain to the owner why this is a bad idea should be ?drummed out of the corp? in my humble opinion.

		 

		The problem is that if you respond to this RFP with 120 or 160 or more hours to really do the design phase modeling right, you will go up against the ?modeler? who claims to be able to do it in far less time.  So how do we get the folks who issue the RFPs to ask for a proper scope of work so that they can compare fees on a level playing field?  It is unfortunate that we are even having a discussion about doing modeling work in opposition to its purpose.

		 

		Sorry for the rant but I feel better now. J

		Omar,

		 

		I would expect, for a building this size, approximately 40 hours (multiply by your hourly rate). The 40 hours include EAp2/EAc1 LEED documentation, and any review you may have to respond to later.

		 

		Now, given that you have never done a LEED model, it will take you more time, possibly up to 40 more hours.

		Greetings everyone,

		 

		I have a question regarding the cost of an energy model for a LEED project. Every energy model I've done so far has been for 

		existing buildings, mainly for optimization purposes. However, I received an RFP to model a five-story, 41,500 sq. ft. building

		that's currently on the design phase and is pursuing the LEED-NC Silver certification. I really have no idea what would be a fair 

		price for this model since I'm going to have to use Appendix G (ASHRAE 90.1) to evaluate the difference between the base 

		and proposed buildings. I don't know how much extra effort this will take. I know the procedure, just haven't done it before.

		 

		Can you shed any light on this issue?

		 

		Thanks in advance!

To Nick's point, I feel the energy target is most valuable when coupled with
some sort of Cost Benefit Analysis. If there is a way to incorporate such a
study into the language, we have an energy target the Owner knows he/she can
afford and high performance strategies will not be value engineered out when
the LEED model is built.

First of all the goal is not at all arbitrary but must be based on an expected outcome within a reasonable expectation.  It is informed by data from similar, actual building energy consumption.  I don?t think I need to explain the tools one can use to do this.

 

Your goal (do the best you can) sounds like, ?let?s build an energy efficient building?.  This is meaningless.  Energy efficiency in the context of new construction is always relative and without a quantification of what energy efficient means this is no goal at all.

 

Like any early stage performance goal the number is adjustable as more is discovered in the design process.  If the target is later discovered to be unreasonable due to a wide range of potential issues, then the target is adjusted.

 

If you pick your EUI goal the way you describe then yes this is a worthless goal but the key point is that it is never selected arbitrarily.

Not to be a jerk, but to ask an honest question: what is the point?  I?ve been involved with ?established energy target? projects and never really picked up on the logic behind it ? I would appreciate a layman?s explanation.

 

Put another way:  If you select an arbitrary EUI or watts per square foot at the earliest stages of design, what have you gained in design process?  If/when a project ?meets the goal? mid-design, are future design decisions supposed to de-emphasize energy impact (no!)?  If on the other hand, a project finds that target unreasonable down the road, what then?  

 

Not setting a mile-marker like this implies designing the best building you can given the time/budget available and any other constraints? that seems more likely to result in the best end-result to me.

 

To draw analogy, if design of a LEED (or any energy-conscious) project is like planning a road trip from Kansas to Florida, setting EUI goals seems something like choosing a rest stop by throwing a dart at the map blindfolded.  It doesn?t help you get to your destination any more efficiently, it may be far out of the way, and now you?ve got a hole in the wall? what was the point?

 

Okay, maybe a weak analogy ? chalking it up to a very long week =).  Honestly, I?d appreciate someone laying the value behind this approach ? I?m expect the logic does exist, and I just haven?t yet seen the light!

Could any one advice why LEED would not put the base design as Watt per square foot, or per occupant, or per hotel bed etc. so the Architecture becomes more innovative early in the design to save energy?

Arpan,

 

Based on the Weidt Group paper, I?m guessing you?re emphasizing architectural considerations that affect the energy cost vs. LEED points numbers. (The paper uses window-to-wall ratios and daylighting as an example.) I would think the goal during the programming and schematic design phases should be energy cost, not LEED points relative to the App. G baseline. Much of the energy cost savings vs. App. G baseline (EAc1 points) is going to come later from the mechanical and lighting designs. The suggestions in the paper to establish specific baseline building shapes and glazing percentages would add a LOT more modeling time ? you?d have to create two separate building geometries for the baseline and proposed models, not to mention different zoning patterns, space types, lighting power per space etc.

 

For mechanical design, once the size and programming of the project is established, the baseline model properties are pretty well set, unless you consider fuel-switching and go between baseline systems 1/3/5/7 to systems 2/4/6/8. One exception I can think of for a design decision that results in higher energy cost but better comparison with the App. G baseline is higher ventilation rates combined with heat recovery in the proposed and no heat recovery in the baseline.

 

Regards,

Bill

Marcus, thank you incorporating this language.

 

The one scenario we often see in our design guidance work is that a proposed design when compared with other design alternates does not necessarily provided the largest energy savings when compared against its own baseline case model. It is difficult to make a recommendation as consultants when we want to present the Owner with both real energy cost savings without compromising their LEED certification level targets.  

A recent paper presented by the Weidt Group at SimBuild touched on this issue:

If anyone has any good ideas about how to structure the LEED credits to end the practice of validation models at the end and encourage/require design phase modeling the folks on the USGBC EA TAG would love to hear them.  The current proposed credit language from the first public comment phase is listed below.

 

NC, CS, SCHOOLS, RETAIL, WAREHOUSE & DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, HOSPITALITY

Establish an energy performance target no later than the schematic design phase. The target must be established as kBTU per square foot-year of source energy use. This target must be mapped on the same scale as the baseline and proposed buildings, if the project follows Option 1.

 

OPTION 1. Whole Building Energy Simulation 

Analyze a minimum of at least nine efficiency measures during the design process and account for the results in design decision-making. Analysis can include energy simulation of efficiency opportunities, application of past energy simulation analyses for similar projects to the project, or application of published data from energy analyses performed for similar projects to the project (such as AEDGs).

 

A minimum of six energy efficiency measures focused on load reduction strategies appropriate for the facility must be analyzed. This analysis must be performed during the schematic design phase.

 

A minimum of three energy efficiency measures focused on HVAC related strategies must be analyzed (passive measures are acceptable). This analysis must be performed before the conclusion of the design development phase.

 

The results of the analysis must be summarized in a brief report or memorandum.

 

 

The next version of LEED will be going out for public comment again in July, I think, so please comment formally as well as discussing here.

OK, Carol..now you threw the "bait" out there..older than dirt, eh?

 

I have done very limited LEED "type" modeling where you compare 20 walls and 40 windows types (well, it seemed that way). Correct me if I am wrong, but a Base model must be built to comply with a certain level of ASHRAE 90.1 (now up to 2010 ??). With all of the nuisances of eQuest 3.64, I am going to build the model from scrathc and put in all the relevant baseline data in by hand.  And, by the way, the ASHRAE baseline model might be an entirely different system.  I am just completing an EPACT evaluation (ASHRAE 90.1-2001) and the Baseline HVAC was screwe chillers, whereas the Actual building was packaged units with Turbocor compressors (ask me how I did that).

 

It very much depends on the complexity of the building. A 40,000 sf office or a 500,000 sf hotel with casino facilites.

 

I am unfamiliar with the LEED paperwork to be filled out after the modeling has been done. But I would not do anything of this type in under 120 hours, preferably 160 hours. If the client thinks he can do better, let him.

 

Contingency, contingency.

 

We won't discuss how old CAROL might be..

Marcus,

You have inadvertently hit upon why IBPSA worked with ASHRAE to create a BEMP certification. That's Building Energy Modeling Professional (BEMP). 

Some of us who have been in the field for awhile began to worry a couple of years ago when so many new energy modelers began appearing on the listserv with questions. Their questions indicated a lack of training and experience that was worrisome. What made it worrisome was that they didn't seem to realize that they were as inexperienced as they were; they didn't appear to be pursuing training to learn how to do what they were doing; and we were uncertain as to how or if they were practicing quality control. We hoped that by creating a path to certification that we would give clients one more qualification to look for in their modelers.

If you have been in this industry for any length of time, and by industry I mean the overall construction industry, you know that you don't get a lot of chances if your work doesn't pan out. If your energy model says I have a LEED Gold building and I'm going to save $4,000/year and what I really get is LEED Silver and $1,000/year, I am not going to be happy. So, I will probably not give you any more work but, even worse for all of us, I'll start expressing doubts about the whole process. LEED - what is it good for?

So, now we all have more training, right? We read our ASHRAE Handbooks and technical manuals so we know how to model the difficult stuff. We can find any topic in the DOE2 Manuals, all of which are one line, available, and easily searchable. 

So now we are so good we can do these models in 40-80 hours. Really? Not me and I've been doing it longer than everyone, except you, John Aulbach. So I'm going to join Marcus in his rant because he's on to something.

It's up to us to not under bid this work. It's up to us to educate our clients about the importance of quality in this process. If they think they are getting the same analysis in 40 hours that they used to get in 120 hours, they need to be led around to rethinking that and to be reminded that GIGO.

Cheers,

Carol

In our experience a final model, done right, would take about 80 hours.

 

WARNING ? frustrated modeling rant to follow:

 

Doing just a final model however completely misses the point as to why we model ? it is to guide design decisions!  

 

If I saw this RFP and all it asked me for was a model to determine LEED points, during or after design, I would try to educate the potential client about the purpose of modeling.

 

Unfortunately too many projects pursuing LEED are only doing the minimum when it comes to modeling and almost completely missing all the benefits.  Too often the ?market? transforms only based on a least first cost denominator basis that results in little real transformation.  Doing models to determine LEED points does not transform the market, save any energy, and just circumvents the purpose behind LEED. (the next version actually requires design phase modeling!)

 

Any ?modeler? who does only final models without attempting to explain to the owner why this is a bad idea should be ?drummed out of the corp? in my humble opinion.

 

The problem is that if you respond to this RFP with 120 or 160 or more hours to really do the design phase modeling right, you will go up against the ?modeler? who claims to be able to do it in far less time.  So how do we get the folks who issue the RFPs to ask for a proper scope of work so that they can compare fees on a level playing field?  It is unfortunate that we are even having a discussion about doing modeling work in opposition to its purpose.

 

Sorry for the rant but I feel better now. J

Omar,

 

I would expect, for a building this size, approximately 40 hours (multiply by your hourly rate). The 40 hours include EAp2/EAc1 LEED documentation, and any review you may have to respond to later.

 

Now, given that you have never done a LEED model, it will take you more time, possibly up to 40 more hours.

Greetings everyone,

 

I have a question regarding the cost of an energy model for a LEED project. Every energy model I've done so far has been for 

existing buildings, mainly for optimization purposes. However, I received an RFP to model a five-story, 41,500 sq. ft. building

that's currently on the design phase and is pursuing the LEED-NC Silver certification. I really have no idea what would be a fair 

price for this model since I'm going to have to use Appendix G (ASHRAE 90.1) to evaluate the difference between the base 

and proposed buildings. I don't know how much extra effort this will take. I know the procedure, just haven't done it before.

 

Can you shed any light on this issue?

 

Thanks in advance!

Julia,

 

I appreciate your thoughts and input.

 

In my opinion early stage modeling (or a reasonable facsimile) should be required for every green building project.  Doing a model at the end for those average projects serves no real purpose and is frankly a waste of everyone?s time (see previous rant).  If we continue to allow this for LEED the market will never change.  Keep in mind we are talking about LEED and its stated purpose is market transformation.  The typical project should not be able to get LEED certified if it works properly in the market.  Right now the market has caught up to LEED in many ways.  If it does not stay ahead of the market then it ceases to have any meaning whatsoever.  So, if not now, when?

 

I don?t disagree that  the current requirements are rather prescriptive and that the number of iterations should vary project-to-project.  I am struggling to come up with an alternative that still requires design phase modeling.

 

One can still earn the prerequisite without early stage modeling, but cannot earn any points for EAc1 as it is now proposed.  I don?t think an ID credit would give enough incentive, too easy to ignore.  There are prescriptive paths specifically to address small projects.

Omar,
This is cracking me up.  I don't think I've ever seen this much traffic on one issue!  LOL.
Regarding the manhours for a LEED model - my opinion is that the amount of time has much more to do with the level of certification the project is going for, at what point the modeling services are engaged in the design, and the type and complexity of the building (systems).  That's not to say the number of manhours is completely independent of building size (square footage), but its not particularly sensitive to it.  I find that that there is a high "low" and low "high" for modeling.  In other words, it's hard to complete an energy model in less than 60-80 hours (all said and done - paperwork, LEED responses etc), but it rarely take more than 250 hours.  (Although, some rare complex projects going for platinmum could take up to 350 hours).  Like others, I find the norm for a reasonably complex bldg going for LEED silver or gold typically requires between 120 and 160 hours. 

Marcus  
Here's my two cents on below. I will look for the public comment period as well.  Thanks for the heads up.
I think the idea of incentivizing modeling early in the design is a great idea, but I think requiring it is completely inappropriate.  Perhaps it could be encouraged by awarding an extra (innovation? or EA cr 1?) point for starting modeling in schematic design.  Or, perhaps the credit could be restructured similar to the CX credits where in order to get the enhanced CX credits, you have to have the CX agent involved early in the design.  In some ways, the current set up already does this though with the progress points for increased levels of saving.  Quite frankly, if you are going for 50% savings, you're not gonig to get there unless you start modeling really early in the process.
  
I also think prescribing a certain minimum number of ECMs to look at is inappropriate and would probably have the adverse effect of discouraging energy modeling.  The appropriate number of ECMs is highly project dependent - based on building size, scope, complexity, type, level of LEED certification shooting for, and not least of all the owner's budget.  Let's face it, the vast majority of bldgs out there and that consume most of the energy in the US are (strip) malls, grocery stores, restaurants etc.  These projects barely event have a schematic, design and CD phase.  While we all love to work on the exotic, platinum level, cutting edge, bldgs that are likely to have a large budget for design, these are not the majority of bldgs consuming energy.  I think we should be doing more to encourage modeling and energy savings amongst the every day projects than the "sexy" projects.  It seems to me the best way to do this is to offer incentives in this direction in lieu of prescriptive requirements that could discourage/put off smaller projects from even attempting to incorporate modeling.  

Julia

If anyone has any good ideas about how to structure the LEED credits to end the practice of validation models at the end and encourage/require design phase modeling the folks on the USGBC EA TAG would love to hear them.  The current proposed credit language from the first public comment phase is listed below.

 

NC, CS, SCHOOLS, RETAIL, WAREHOUSE & DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, HOSPITALITY

Establish an energy performance target no later than the schematic design phase. The target must be established as kBTU per square foot-year of source energy use. This target must be mapped on the same scale as the baseline and proposed buildings, if the project follows Option 1.

 

OPTION 1. Whole Building Energy Simulation 

Analyze a minimum of at least nine efficiency measures during the design process and account for the results in design decision-making. Analysis can include energy simulation of efficiency opportunities, application of past energy simulation analyses for similar projects to the project, or application of published data from energy analyses performed for similar projects to the project (such as AEDGs).

 

A minimum of six energy efficiency measures focused on load reduction strategies appropriate for the facility must be analyzed. This analysis must be performed during the schematic design phase.

 

A minimum of three energy efficiency measures focused on HVAC related strategies must be analyzed (passive measures are acceptable). This analysis must be performed before the conclusion of the design development phase.

 

The results of the analysis must be summarized in a brief report or memorandum.

 

 

The next version of LEED will be going out for public comment again in July, I think, so please comment formally as well as discussing here.

OK, Carol..now you threw the "bait" out there..older than dirt, eh?

 

I have done very limited LEED "type" modeling where you compare 20 walls and 40 windows types (well, it seemed that way). Correct me if I am wrong, but a Base model must be built to comply with a certain level of ASHRAE 90.1 (now up to 2010 ??). With all of the nuisances of eQuest 3.64, I am going to build the model from scrathc and put in all the relevant baseline data in by hand.  And, by the way, the ASHRAE baseline model might be an entirely different system.  I am just completing an EPACT evaluation (ASHRAE 90.1-2001) and the Baseline HVAC was screwe chillers, whereas the Actual building was packaged units with Turbocor compressors (ask me how I did that).

 

It very much depends on the complexity of the building. A 40,000 sf office or a 500,000 sf hotel with casino facilites.

 

I am unfamiliar with the LEED paperwork to be filled out after the modeling has been done. But I would not do anything of this type in under 120 hours, preferably 160 hours. If the client thinks he can do better, let him.

 

Contingency, contingency.

 

We won't discuss how old CAROL might be..

 

John A.

Marcus,

You have inadvertently hit upon why IBPSA worked with ASHRAE to create a BEMP certification. That's Building Energy Modeling Professional (BEMP). 

Some of us who have been in the field for awhile began to worry a couple of years ago when so many new energy modelers began appearing on the listserv with questions. Their questions indicated a lack of training and experience that was worrisome. What made it worrisome was that they didn't seem to realize that they were as inexperienced as they were; they didn't appear to be pursuing training to learn how to do what they were doing; and we were uncertain as to how or if they were practicing quality control. We hoped that by creating a path to certification that we would give clients one more qualification to look for in their modelers.

If you have been in this industry for any length of time, and by industry I mean the overall construction industry, you know that you don't get a lot of chances if your work doesn't pan out. If your energy model says I have a LEED Gold building and I'm going to save $4,000/year and what I really get is LEED Silver and $1,000/year, I am not going to be happy. So, I will probably not give you any more work but, even worse for all of us, I'll start expressing doubts about the whole process. LEED - what is it good for?

So, now we all have more training, right? We read our ASHRAE Handbooks and technical manuals so we know how to model the difficult stuff. We can find any topic in the DOE2 Manuals, all of which are one line, available, and easily searchable. 

So now we are so good we can do these models in 40-80 hours. Really? Not me and I've been doing it longer than everyone, except you, John Aulbach. So I'm going to join Marcus in his rant because he's on to something.

It's up to us to not under bid this work. It's up to us to educate our clients about the importance of quality in this process. If they think they are getting the same analysis in 40 hours that they used to get in 120 hours, they need to be led around to rethinking that and to be reminded that GIGO.

Cheers,

Carol

In our experience a final model, done right, would take about 80 hours.

 

WARNING ? frustrated modeling rant to follow:

 

Doing just a final model however completely misses the point as to why we model ? it is to guide design decisions!  

 

If I saw this RFP and all it asked me for was a model to determine LEED points, during or after design, I would try to educate the potential client about the purpose of modeling.

 

Unfortunately too many projects pursuing LEED are only doing the minimum when it comes to modeling and almost completely missing all the benefits.  Too often the ?market? transforms only based on a least first cost denominator basis that results in little real transformation.  Doing models to determine LEED points does not transform the market, save any energy, and just circumvents the purpose behind LEED. (the next version actually requires design phase modeling!)

 

Any ?modeler? who does only final models without attempting to explain to the owner why this is a bad idea should be ?drummed out of the corp? in my humble opinion.

 

The problem is that if you respond to this RFP with 120 or 160 or more hours to really do the design phase modeling right, you will go up against the ?modeler? who claims to be able to do it in far less time.  So how do we get the folks who issue the RFPs to ask for a proper scope of work so that they can compare fees on a level playing field?  It is unfortunate that we are even having a discussion about doing modeling work in opposition to its purpose.

 

Sorry for the rant but I feel better now. J

Omar,

 

I would expect, for a building this size, approximately 40 hours (multiply by your hourly rate). The 40 hours include EAp2/EAc1 LEED documentation, and any review you may have to respond to later.

 

Now, given that you have never done a LEED model, it will take you more time, possibly up to 40 more hours.

Greetings everyone,

 

I have a question regarding the cost of an energy model for a LEED project. Every energy model I've done so far has been for 

existing buildings, mainly for optimization purposes. However, I received an RFP to model a five-story, 41,500 sq. ft. building

that's currently on the design phase and is pursuing the LEED-NC Silver certification. I really have no idea what would be a fair 

price for this model since I'm going to have to use Appendix G (ASHRAE 90.1) to evaluate the difference between the base 

and proposed buildings. I don't know how much extra effort this will take. I know the procedure, just haven't done it before.

 

Can you shed any light on this issue?

 

Thanks in advance!

Jason,

I think that you have a very interesting idea.  I like that it has come up
in the process of discussing future approaches to LEED EA C1 in regards to
early modeling.  Many modelers with experience can provide useful data to
their clients early in the design stages, but as has been said many times,
how is LEED (or other rating agency) to know what was modeled, when, why and
what benefit did it have?  In addition, the standard could be used to better
inform the rest of the design team and the building owner what is involved
and expected of modeling at different design phases.  I guess I'm saying -
count me in!

While we have Marcus's attention, I would like to rant !

Since the next version of LEED will have a credit dedicated to peak demand
reduction, can we make it so that credit cannot be taken for EAp2c1 for
thermal energy storage systems?

The peak demand credit already addresses reduction of power generation at
the power plant scale, so optimize energy performance can be more true to
reduction of site energy.

Too many towers apply no energy conservation measures to internal gains and
simply transfer their cooling requirements to their CALMAC tanks.

Ah...thanks Jason.  I see now.  
Sounds like your concept will complement App G in 90.1/189.1 well.

Molly, perhaps it's something we could ultimately reference in 189.1 and 
interact with their potential committee.

Julia,

What I am suggesting has to do with the process of designing 
a building using simulation during each step of the process. 
It is not about establishing baseline and determining a 
percentage savings, Appendix G does that already. I would 
hope that both 90.1 Appendix G and this new standard would 
be referenced, G for establishing a measurement and the new 
standard for establishing a process.

While I conceptually agree with and understand the kbtu or watts/sf approach, to 
me, there seems to be some series issues with it in reality.

First, I don't agree that generating or coming up with appropriate target values 
during design is always (or even frequently) an easy thing to do or easy data to 
find.  It depends on your bldg type.  I do a lot of labs and hospitals.  
Manufacturing and industrial use bldgs can have the same issues.  Good EUI data 
is not easy to come by for these bldg types - partly because the user equipment 
that is installed in them can be a big portion of the energy demand and 
consumption and it's always changing and can be very specific to each client.  
For example: is it a community hosptial with more modest and generic care 
provide?....a state of the art hospital with specialized care functions?....does 
the lab have primarily biology or a chemistry functions....etc etc.  These 
things all affect the EUI.  In my opinion, the best resource for this data is 
actually utility companies based on data from similar customers, but that data 
is not generally publicly available and/or the population of similar comparable 
buildings may be small and difficult to relate to your bldg.  


Second, quite frankly, in my opinion, DESIGN phase energy models are poor 
predictors of ACTUAL bldg energy use.  They are best at predicting RELATIVE 
(comparative) energy use.  This is not because the tools are not good or 
inaccurate but because we and the owners are so poor at predicting how the bldg 
will actually be used, weather, etc.  One additional factor, is what equipment 
will actually be installed.  It's not uncommon for the technology to have 
changed bewteen the time that we start design and the time the equipment is 
actually purchased closer to the end of construction.  All these things effect 
not only the equipment w/sf usage but the ac w/sf usage etc.   So, there seems 
to me to be a serious disconnect to me if we talking about setting energy 
targets during DESIGNbased on statistical data of ACTUAL energy use and trying 
to use those figure during the design phase for predicted energy use.  Again, I 
love the idea but are we really there yet in reality.  It seems to me we need a 
lot more data that doesn't exist yet - and mechanism to collect that data.  
(CBECS etc are good, but the population and variability for bldgs of these types 
has a long way to go).

I missing something about what's being proposed/talked about?

First of all the goal is not at all arbitrary but must be based on an expected 
outcome within a reasonable expectation.  It is informed by data from similar, 
actual building energy consumption.  I don?t think I need to explain the tools 
one can use to do this.
 
Your goal (do the best you can) sounds like, ?let?s build an energy efficient 
building?.  This is meaningless.  Energy efficiency in the context of new 
construction is always relative and without a quantification of what energy 
efficient means this is no goal at all.
 
Like any early stage performance goal the number is adjustable as more is 
discovered in the design process.  If the target is later discovered to be 
unreasonable due to a wide range of potential issues, then the target is 
adjusted.
 
If you pick your EUI goal the way you describe then yes this is a worthless goal 
but the key point is that it is never selected arbitrarily.

Not to be a jerk, but to ask an honest question: what is the point?  I?ve been 
involved with ?established energy target? projects and never really picked up on 
the logic behind it ? I would appreciate a layman?s explanation.
 
Put another way:  If you select an arbitrary EUI or watts per square foot at the 
earliest stages of design, what have you gained in design process?  If/when a 
project ?meets the goal? mid-design, are future design decisions supposed to 
de-emphasize energy impact (no!)?  If on the other hand, a project finds that 
target unreasonable down the road, what then?  

 
Not setting a mile-marker like this implies designing the best building you can 
given the time/budget available and any other constraints? that seems more 
likely to result in the best end-result to me.
 
To draw analogy, if design of a LEED (or any energy-conscious) project is like 
planning a road trip from Kansas to Florida, setting EUI goals seems something 
like choosing a rest stop by throwing a dart at the map blindfolded.  It doesn?t 
help you get to your destination any more efficiently, it may be far out of the 
way, and now you?ve got a hole in the wall? what was the point?
 
Okay, maybe a weak analogy ? chalking it up to a very long week =).  Honestly, 
I?d appreciate someone laying the value behind this approach ? I?m expect the 
logic does exist, and I just haven?t yet seen the light!

Agreed.  The new credit language for the next version of LEED does ask project 
teams to establish an absolute performance goal.

Could any one advice why LEED would not put the base design as Watt per square 
foot, or per occupant, or per hotel bed etc. so the Architecture becomes more 
innovative early in the design to save energy?

most        LEED points
Arpan,
 
Based on the Weidt Group paper, I?m guessing you?re emphasizing architectural 
considerations that affect the energy cost vs. LEED points numbers. (The paper 
uses window-to-wall ratios and daylighting as an example.) I would think the 
goal during the programming and schematic design phases should be energy cost, 
not LEED points relative to the App. G baseline. Much of the energy cost savings 
vs. App. G baseline (EAc1 points) is going to come later from the mechanical and 
lighting designs. The suggestions in the paper to establish specific baseline 
building shapes and glazing percentages would add a LOT more modeling time ? 
you?d have to create two separate building geometries for the baseline and 
proposed models, not to mention different zoning patterns, space types, lighting 
power per space etc.
 
For mechanical design, once the size and programming of the project is 
established, the baseline model properties are pretty well set, unless you 
consider fuel-switching and go between baseline systems 1/3/5/7 to systems 
2/4/6/8. One exception I can think of for a design decision that results in 
higher energy cost but better comparison with the App. G baseline is higher 
ventilation rates combined with heat recovery in the proposed and no heat 
recovery in the baseline.
 
Regards,
Bill

Marcus, thank you incorporating this language.
 
The one scenario we often see in our design guidance work is that a proposed 
design when compared with other design alternates does not necessarily provided 
the largest energy savings when compared against its own baseline case model. It 
is difficult to make a recommendation as consultants when we want to present the 
Owner with both real energy cost savings without compromising their LEED 
certification level targets.  
A recent paper presented by the Weidt Group at SimBuild touched on this issue:

The primary purpose is to get the conversation started, early.  It is an opportunity to educate the owner and the team about energy.  In my experience the majority of designers can?t even tell you the metric for comparing building energy consumption.  I have often had this conversation early in the project design and have been met with blank stares.  It is incumbent upon us who do understand these energy issues to get the conversation started.  Caveat the heck out of the goal, explain the limitations, discuss the relative vs absolute metrics, be open about the issues ? so that we can raise awareness one conversation at a time.  This is the power of a market transformation tool like LEED.  It enables us to have these conversations.

 

I agree that both of these items are potential issues, talk to your clients about them.  If you don?t have a goal, how do you measure success?

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Energy Model Cost - best design doesn'tequalmost LEED points

 

While I conceptually agree with and understand the kbtu or watts/sf approach, to me, there seems to be some series issues with it in reality.

First, I don't agree that generating or coming up with appropriate target values during design is always (or even frequently) an easy thing to do or easy data to find.  It depends on your bldg type.  I do a lot of labs and hospitals.  Manufacturing and industrial use bldgs can have the same issues.  Good EUI data is not easy to come by for these bldg types - partly because the user equipment that is installed in them can be a big portion of the energy demand and consumption and it's always changing and can be very specific to each client.  For example: is it a community hosptial with more modest and generic care provide?....a state of the art hospital with specialized care functions?....does the lab have primarily biology or a chemistry functions....etc etc.  These things all affect the EUI.  In my opinion, the best resource for this data is actually utility companies based on data from similar customers, but that data is not generally publicly available and/or the population of similar comparable buildings may be small and difficult to relate to your bldg.  

Second, quite frankly, in my opinion, DESIGN phase energy models are poor predictors of ACTUAL bldg energy use.  They are best at predicting RELATIVE (comparative) energy use.  This is not because the tools are not good or inaccurate but because we and the owners are so poor at predicting how the bldg will actually be used, weather, etc.  One additional factor, is what equipment will actually be installed.  It's not uncommon for the technology to have changed bewteen the time that we start design and the time the equipment is actually purchased closer to the end of construction.  All these things effect not only the equipment w/sf usage but the ac w/sf usage etc.   So, there seems to me to be a serious disconnect to me if we talking about setting energy targets during DESIGNbased on statistical data of ACTUAL energy use and trying to use those figure during the design phase for predicted energy use.  Again, I love the idea but are we really there yet in reality.  It seems to me we need a lot more data that doesn't exist yet - and mechanism to collect that data.  (CBECS etc are good, but the population and variability for bldgs of these types has a long way to go).

I missing something about what's being proposed/talked about?

First of all the goal is not at all arbitrary but must be based on an expected outcome within a reasonable expectation.  It is informed by data from similar, actual building energy consumption.  I don?t think I need to explain the tools one can use to do this.

 

Your goal (do the best you can) sounds like, ?let?s build an energy efficient building?.  This is meaningless.  Energy efficiency in the context of new construction is always relative and without a quantification of what energy efficient means this is no goal at all.

 

Like any early stage performance goal the number is adjustable as more is discovered in the design process.  If the target is later discovered to be unreasonable due to a wide range of potential issues, then the target is adjusted.

 

If you pick your EUI goal the way you describe then yes this is a worthless goal but the key point is that it is never selected arbitrarily.

Not to be a jerk, but to ask an honest question: what is the point?  I?ve been involved with ?established energy target? projects and never really picked up on the logic behind it ? I would appreciate a layman?s explanation.

 

Put another way:  If you select an arbitrary EUI or watts per square foot at the earliest stages of design, what have you gained in design process?  If/when a project ?meets the goal? mid-design, are future design decisions supposed to de-emphasize energy impact (no!)?  If on the other hand, a project finds that target unreasonable down the road, what then?  

 

Not setting a mile-marker like this implies designing the best building you can given the time/budget available and any other constraints? that seems more likely to result in the best end-result to me.

 

To draw analogy, if design of a LEED (or any energy-conscious) project is like planning a road trip from Kansas to Florida, setting EUI goals seems something like choosing a rest stop by throwing a dart at the map blindfolded.  It doesn?t help you get to your destination any more efficiently, it may be far out of the way, and now you?ve got a hole in the wall? what was the point?

 

Okay, maybe a weak analogy ? chalking it up to a very long week =).  Honestly, I?d appreciate someone laying the value behind this approach ? I?m expect the logic does exist, and I just haven?t yet seen the light!

Arpan,

 

Based on the Weidt Group paper, I?m guessing you?re emphasizing architectural considerations that affect the energy cost vs. LEED points numbers. (The paper uses window-to-wall ratios and daylighting as an example.) I would think the goal during the programming and schematic design phases should be energy cost, not LEED points relative to the App. G baseline. Much of the energy cost savings vs. App. G baseline (EAc1 points) is going to come later from the mechanical and lighting designs. The suggestions in the paper to establish specific baseline building shapes and glazing percentages would add a LOT more modeling time ? you?d have to create two separate building geometries for the baseline and proposed models, not to mention different zoning patterns, space types, lighting power per space etc.

 

For mechanical design, once the size and programming of the project is established, the baseline model properties are pretty well set, unless you consider fuel-switching and go between baseline systems 1/3/5/7 to systems 2/4/6/8. One exception I can think of for a design decision that results in higher energy cost but better comparison with the App. G baseline is higher ventilation rates combined with heat recovery in the proposed and no heat recovery in the baseline.

 

Regards,

Bill

Marcus, thank you incorporating this language.

 

The one scenario we often see in our design guidance work is that a proposed design when compared with other design alternates does not necessarily provided the largest energy savings when compared against its own baseline case model. It is difficult to make a recommendation as consultants when we want to present the Owner with both real energy cost savings without compromising their LEED certification level targets.  

A recent paper presented by the Weidt Group at SimBuild touched on this issue:

If anyone has any good ideas about how to structure the LEED credits to end the practice of validation models at the end and encourage/require design phase modeling the folks on the USGBC EA TAG would love to hear them.  The current proposed credit language from the first public comment phase is listed below.

 

NC, CS, SCHOOLS, RETAIL, WAREHOUSE & DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, HOSPITALITY

Establish an energy performance target no later than the schematic design phase. The target must be established as kBTU per square foot-year of source energy use. This target must be mapped on the same scale as the baseline and proposed buildings, if the project follows Option 1.

 

OPTION 1. Whole Building Energy Simulation 

Analyze a minimum of at least nine efficiency measures during the design process and account for the results in design decision-making. Analysis can include energy simulation of efficiency opportunities, application of past energy simulation analyses for similar projects to the project, or application of published data from energy analyses performed for similar projects to the project (such as AEDGs).

 

A minimum of six energy efficiency measures focused on load reduction strategies appropriate for the facility must be analyzed. This analysis must be performed during the schematic design phase.

 

A minimum of three energy efficiency measures focused on HVAC related strategies must be analyzed (passive measures are acceptable). This analysis must be performed before the conclusion of the design development phase.

 

The results of the analysis must be summarized in a brief report or memorandum.

 

 

The next version of LEED will be going out for public comment again in July, I think, so please comment formally as well as discussing here.

OK, Carol..now you threw the "bait" out there..older than dirt, eh?

 

I have done very limited LEED "type" modeling where you compare 20 walls and 40 windows types (well, it seemed that way). Correct me if I am wrong, but a Base model must be built to comply with a certain level of ASHRAE 90.1 (now up to 2010 ??). With all of the nuisances of eQuest 3.64, I am going to build the model from scrathc and put in all the relevant baseline data in by hand.  And, by the way, the ASHRAE baseline model might be an entirely different system.  I am just completing an EPACT evaluation (ASHRAE 90.1-2001) and the Baseline HVAC was screwe chillers, whereas the Actual building was packaged units with Turbocor compressors (ask me how I did that).

 

It very much depends on the complexity of the building. A 40,000 sf office or a 500,000 sf hotel with casino facilites.

 

I am unfamiliar with the LEED paperwork to be filled out after the modeling has been done. But I would not do anything of this type in under 120 hours, preferably 160 hours. If the client thinks he can do better, let him.

 

Contingency, contingency.

 

We won't discuss how old CAROL might be..

Marcus,

You have inadvertently hit upon why IBPSA worked with ASHRAE to create a BEMP certification. That's Building Energy Modeling Professional (BEMP). 

Some of us who have been in the field for awhile began to worry a couple of years ago when so many new energy modelers began appearing on the listserv with questions. Their questions indicated a lack of training and experience that was worrisome. What made it worrisome was that they didn't seem to realize that they were as inexperienced as they were; they didn't appear to be pursuing training to learn how to do what they were doing; and we were uncertain as to how or if they were practicing quality control. We hoped that by creating a path to certification that we would give clients one more qualification to look for in their modelers.

If you have been in this industry for any length of time, and by industry I mean the overall construction industry, you know that you don't get a lot of chances if your work doesn't pan out. If your energy model says I have a LEED Gold building and I'm going to save $4,000/year and what I really get is LEED Silver and $1,000/year, I am not going to be happy. So, I will probably not give you any more work but, even worse for all of us, I'll start expressing doubts about the whole process. LEED - what is it good for?

So, now we all have more training, right? We read our ASHRAE Handbooks and technical manuals so we know how to model the difficult stuff. We can find any topic in the DOE2 Manuals, all of which are one line, available, and easily searchable. 

So now we are so good we can do these models in 40-80 hours. Really? Not me and I've been doing it longer than everyone, except you, John Aulbach. So I'm going to join Marcus in his rant because he's on to something.

It's up to us to not under bid this work. It's up to us to educate our clients about the importance of quality in this process. If they think they are getting the same analysis in 40 hours that they used to get in 120 hours, they need to be led around to rethinking that and to be reminded that GIGO.

Cheers,

Carol

WARNING ? frustrated modeling rant to follow:

 

Doing just a final model however completely misses the point as to why we model ? it is to guide design decisions!  

 

If I saw this RFP and all it asked me for was a model to determine LEED points, during or after design, I would try to educate the potential client about the purpose of modeling.

 

Unfortunately too many projects pursuing LEED are only doing the minimum when it comes to modeling and almost completely missing all the benefits.  Too often the ?market? transforms only based on a least first cost denominator basis that results in little real transformation.  Doing models to determine LEED points does not transform the market, save any energy, and just circumvents the purpose behind LEED. (the next version actually requires design phase modeling!)

 

Any ?modeler? who does only final models without attempting to explain to the owner why this is a bad idea should be ?drummed out of the corp? in my humble opinion.

 

The problem is that if you respond to this RFP with 120 or 160 or more hours to really do the design phase modeling right, you will go up against the ?modeler? who claims to be able to do it in far less time.  So how do we get the folks who issue the RFPs to ask for a proper scope of work so that they can compare fees on a level playing field?  It is unfortunate that we are even having a discussion about doing modeling work in opposition to its purpose.

 

Sorry for the rant but I feel better now. J

Omar,

 

I would expect, for a building this size, approximately 40 hours (multiply by your hourly rate). The 40 hours include EAp2/EAc1 LEED documentation, and any review you may have to respond to later.

 

Now, given that you have never done a LEED model, it will take you more time, possibly up to 40 more hours.

Greetings everyone,

 

I have a question regarding the cost of an energy model for a LEED project. Every energy model I've done so far has been for 

existing buildings, mainly for optimization purposes. However, I received an RFP to model a five-story, 41,500 sq. ft. building

that's currently on the design phase and is pursuing the LEED-NC Silver certification. I really have no idea what would be a fair 

price for this model since I'm going to have to use Appendix G (ASHRAE 90.1) to evaluate the difference between the base 

and proposed buildings. I don't know how much extra effort this will take. I know the procedure, just haven't done it before.

 

Can you shed any light on this issue?

 

Thanks in advance!

The primary purpose is to get the conversation started, early.  It is an opportunity to educate the owner and the team about energy.  In my experience the majority of designers can?t even tell you the metric for comparing building energy consumption.  I have often had this conversation early in the project design and have been met with blank stares.  It is incumbent upon us who do understand these energy issues to get the conversation started.  Caveat the heck out of the goal, explain the limitations, discuss the relative vs absolute metrics, be open about the issues ? so that we can raise awareness one conversation at a time.  This is the power of a market transformation tool like LEED.  It enables us to have these conversations.

 

I agree that both of these items are potential issues, talk to your clients about them.  If you don?t have a goal, how do you measure success?

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Energy Model Cost - best design doesn'tequalmost LEED points

 

While I conceptually agree with and understand the kbtu or watts/sf approach, to me, there seems to be some series issues with it in reality.

First, I don't agree that generating or coming up with appropriate target values during design is always (or even frequently) an easy thing to do or easy data to find.  It depends on your bldg type.  I do a lot of labs and hospitals.  Manufacturing and industrial use bldgs can have the same issues.  Good EUI data is not easy to come by for these bldg types - partly because the user equipment that is installed in them can be a big portion of the energy demand and consumption and it's always changing and can be very specific to each client.  For example: is it a community hosptial with more modest and generic care provide?....a state of the art hospital with specialized care functions?....does the lab have primarily biology or a chemistry functions....etc etc.  These things all affect the EUI.  In my opinion, the best resource for this data is actually utility companies based on data from similar customers, but that data is not generally publicly available and/or the population of similar comparable buildings may be small and difficult to relate to your bldg.  

Second, quite frankly, in my opinion, DESIGN phase energy models are poor predictors of ACTUAL bldg energy use.  They are best at predicting RELATIVE (comparative) energy use.  This is not because the tools are not good or inaccurate but because we and the owners are so poor at predicting how the bldg will actually be used, weather, etc.  One additional factor, is what equipment will actually be installed.  It's not uncommon for the technology to have changed bewteen the time that we start design and the time the equipment is actually purchased closer to the end of construction.  All these things effect not only the equipment w/sf usage but the ac w/sf usage etc.   So, there seems to me to be a serious disconnect to me if we talking about setting energy targets during DESIGNbased on statistical data of ACTUAL energy use and trying to use those figure during the design phase for predicted energy use.  Again, I love the idea but are we really there yet in reality.  It seems to me we need a lot more data that doesn't exist yet - and mechanism to collect that data.  (CBECS etc are good, but the population and variability for bldgs of these types has a long way to go).

I missing something about what's being proposed/talked about?

First of all the goal is not at all arbitrary but must be based on an expected outcome within a reasonable expectation.  It is informed by data from similar, actual building energy consumption.  I don?t think I need to explain the tools one can use to do this.

 

Your goal (do the best you can) sounds like, ?let?s build an energy efficient building?.  This is meaningless.  Energy efficiency in the context of new construction is always relative and without a quantification of what energy efficient means this is no goal at all.

 

Like any early stage performance goal the number is adjustable as more is discovered in the design process.  If the target is later discovered to be unreasonable due to a wide range of potential issues, then the target is adjusted.

 

If you pick your EUI goal the way you describe then yes this is a worthless goal but the key point is that it is never selected arbitrarily.

Not to be a jerk, but to ask an honest question: what is the point?  I?ve been involved with ?established energy target? projects and never really picked up on the logic behind it ? I would appreciate a layman?s explanation.

 

Put another way:  If you select an arbitrary EUI or watts per square foot at the earliest stages of design, what have you gained in design process?  If/when a project ?meets the goal? mid-design, are future design decisions supposed to de-emphasize energy impact (no!)?  If on the other hand, a project finds that target unreasonable down the road, what then?  

 

Not setting a mile-marker like this implies designing the best building you can given the time/budget available and any other constraints? that seems more likely to result in the best end-result to me.

 

To draw analogy, if design of a LEED (or any energy-conscious) project is like planning a road trip from Kansas to Florida, setting EUI goals seems something like choosing a rest stop by throwing a dart at the map blindfolded.  It doesn?t help you get to your destination any more efficiently, it may be far out of the way, and now you?ve got a hole in the wall? what was the point?

 

Okay, maybe a weak analogy ? chalking it up to a very long week =).  Honestly, I?d appreciate someone laying the value behind this approach ? I?m expect the logic does exist, and I just haven?t yet seen the light!

Arpan,

 

Based on the Weidt Group paper, I?m guessing you?re emphasizing architectural considerations that affect the energy cost vs. LEED points numbers. (The paper uses window-to-wall ratios and daylighting as an example.) I would think the goal during the programming and schematic design phases should be energy cost, not LEED points relative to the App. G baseline. Much of the energy cost savings vs. App. G baseline (EAc1 points) is going to come later from the mechanical and lighting designs. The suggestions in the paper to establish specific baseline building shapes and glazing percentages would add a LOT more modeling time ? you?d have to create two separate building geometries for the baseline and proposed models, not to mention different zoning patterns, space types, lighting power per space etc.

 

For mechanical design, once the size and programming of the project is established, the baseline model properties are pretty well set, unless you consider fuel-switching and go between baseline systems 1/3/5/7 to systems 2/4/6/8. One exception I can think of for a design decision that results in higher energy cost but better comparison with the App. G baseline is higher ventilation rates combined with heat recovery in the proposed and no heat recovery in the baseline.

 

Regards,

Bill

Marcus, thank you incorporating this language.

 

The one scenario we often see in our design guidance work is that a proposed design when compared with other design alternates does not necessarily provided the largest energy savings when compared against its own baseline case model. It is difficult to make a recommendation as consultants when we want to present the Owner with both real energy cost savings without compromising their LEED certification level targets.  

A recent paper presented by the Weidt Group at SimBuild touched on this issue:

If anyone has any good ideas about how to structure the LEED credits to end the practice of validation models at the end and encourage/require design phase modeling the folks on the USGBC EA TAG would love to hear them.  The current proposed credit language from the first public comment phase is listed below.

 

NC, CS, SCHOOLS, RETAIL, WAREHOUSE & DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, HOSPITALITY

Establish an energy performance target no later than the schematic design phase. The target must be established as kBTU per square foot-year of source energy use. This target must be mapped on the same scale as the baseline and proposed buildings, if the project follows Option 1.

 

OPTION 1. Whole Building Energy Simulation 

Analyze a minimum of at least nine efficiency measures during the design process and account for the results in design decision-making. Analysis can include energy simulation of efficiency opportunities, application of past energy simulation analyses for similar projects to the project, or application of published data from energy analyses performed for similar projects to the project (such as AEDGs).

 

A minimum of six energy efficiency measures focused on load reduction strategies appropriate for the facility must be analyzed. This analysis must be performed during the schematic design phase.

 

A minimum of three energy efficiency measures focused on HVAC related strategies must be analyzed (passive measures are acceptable). This analysis must be performed before the conclusion of the design development phase.

 

The results of the analysis must be summarized in a brief report or memorandum.

 

 

The next version of LEED will be going out for public comment again in July, I think, so please comment formally as well as discussing here.

OK, Carol..now you threw the "bait" out there..older than dirt, eh?

 

I have done very limited LEED "type" modeling where you compare 20 walls and 40 windows types (well, it seemed that way). Correct me if I am wrong, but a Base model must be built to comply with a certain level of ASHRAE 90.1 (now up to 2010 ??). With all of the nuisances of eQuest 3.64, I am going to build the model from scrathc and put in all the relevant baseline data in by hand.  And, by the way, the ASHRAE baseline model might be an entirely different system.  I am just completing an EPACT evaluation (ASHRAE 90.1-2001) and the Baseline HVAC was screwe chillers, whereas the Actual building was packaged units with Turbocor compressors (ask me how I did that).

 

It very much depends on the complexity of the building. A 40,000 sf office or a 500,000 sf hotel with casino facilites.

 

I am unfamiliar with the LEED paperwork to be filled out after the modeling has been done. But I would not do anything of this type in under 120 hours, preferably 160 hours. If the client thinks he can do better, let him.

 

Contingency, contingency.

 

We won't discuss how old CAROL might be..

Marcus,

You have inadvertently hit upon why IBPSA worked with ASHRAE to create a BEMP certification. That's Building Energy Modeling Professional (BEMP). 

Some of us who have been in the field for awhile began to worry a couple of years ago when so many new energy modelers began appearing on the listserv with questions. Their questions indicated a lack of training and experience that was worrisome. What made it worrisome was that they didn't seem to realize that they were as inexperienced as they were; they didn't appear to be pursuing training to learn how to do what they were doing; and we were uncertain as to how or if they were practicing quality control. We hoped that by creating a path to certification that we would give clients one more qualification to look for in their modelers.

If you have been in this industry for any length of time, and by industry I mean the overall construction industry, you know that you don't get a lot of chances if your work doesn't pan out. If your energy model says I have a LEED Gold building and I'm going to save $4,000/year and what I really get is LEED Silver and $1,000/year, I am not going to be happy. So, I will probably not give you any more work but, even worse for all of us, I'll start expressing doubts about the whole process. LEED - what is it good for?

So, now we all have more training, right? We read our ASHRAE Handbooks and technical manuals so we know how to model the difficult stuff. We can find any topic in the DOE2 Manuals, all of which are one line, available, and easily searchable. 

So now we are so good we can do these models in 40-80 hours. Really? Not me and I've been doing it longer than everyone, except you, John Aulbach. So I'm going to join Marcus in his rant because he's on to something.

It's up to us to not under bid this work. It's up to us to educate our clients about the importance of quality in this process. If they think they are getting the same analysis in 40 hours that they used to get in 120 hours, they need to be led around to rethinking that and to be reminded that GIGO.

Hi all, 

The CaGBC Enegy task force and EE Tag has developed a modeling guide and it
is available at CaGBC.org

Hi Jason,
could you elaborate a little more on your vision.  
>From the write up, it sounds to me like you're talking more about
establishing a modeling process protocol - yes?
It also describes ASHREA 90.1 and 189.1 as being prescriptive approaches.
But, both those documents have the alternative (app G) performance based
approach too.  As we all know, this established modeling rules and the
parameters for your baseline building etc, but doesn't mandate a certain
modeling process (i.e. when modeling starts in the design, options to be
considered etc).
So, do you see your proposed standard as supplementing those in terms of
establishing a modeling process protocol?  Or, would your standard also
establish modeling rules and baseline building parameters like App G?

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Energy Model Cost

I have been thinking about trying to establish a new 
standard at ASHRAE that I tentatively titled:

"Simulation Aided Design for High Performance Buildings"

The new standard, once deveoped, could be referenced by 
USGBC and other organizations. The concept is similar to the 
direction that USGBC is considering. Attached is a draft 
describing the concept. I think having a group of practicing 
simulation consultants would be key to making such a 
standard usable and adopted.

Please let me know if you have any comments and if you would 
be interested in participating in developing a new standard. 
If I have enough interest, I will submit the necessary 
paperwork to ASHRAE to get this considered.

Thanks

Jason

The primary purpose is to get the conversation started, early. It is an opportunity to educate the owner and the team about energy. In my experience the majority of designers can?t even tell you the metric for comparing building energy consumption. I have often had this conversation early in the project design and have been met with blank stares. It is incumbent upon us who do understand these energy issues to get the conversation started. Caveat the heck out of the goal, explain the limitations, discuss the relative vs absolute metrics, be open about the issues ? so that we can raise awareness one conversation at a time. This is the power of a market transformation tool like LEED. It enables us to have these conversations. 



I agree that both of these items are potential issues, talk to your clients about them. If you don?t have a goal, how do you measure success?

While I conceptually agree with and understand the kbtu or watts/sf approach, to me, there seems to be some series issues with it in reality. 

First, I don't agree that generating or coming up with appropriate target values during design is always (or even frequently) an easy thing to do or easy data to find. It depends on your bldg type. I do a lot of labs and hospitals. Manufacturing and industrial use bldgs can have the same issues. Good EUI data is not easy to come by for these bldg types - partly because the user equipment that is installed in them can be a big portion of the energy demand and consumption and it's always changing and can be very specific to each client. For example: is it a community hosptial with more modest and generic care provide?....a state of the art hospital with specialized care functions?....does the lab have primarily biology or a chemistry functions....etc etc. These things all affect the EUI. In my opinion, the best resource for this data is actually utility companies based on data from similar customers, but that data is not generally publicly available and/or the population of similar comparable buildings may be small and difficult to relate to your bldg. 

Second, quite frankly, in my opinion, DESIGN phase energy models are poor predictors of ACTUAL bldg energy use. They are best at predicting RELATIVE (comparative) energy use. This is not because the tools are not good or inaccurate but because we and the owners are so poor at predicting how the bldg will actually be used, weather, etc. One additional factor, is what equipment will actually be installed. It's not uncommon for the technology to have changed bewteen the time that we start design and the time the equipment is actually purchased closer to the end of construction. All these things effect not only the equipment w/sf usage but the ac w/sf usage etc. So, there seems to me to be a serious disconnect to me if we talking about setting energy targets during DESIGNbased on statistical data of ACTUAL energy use and trying to use those figure during the design phase for predicted energy use. Again, I love the idea but are we really there yet in reality. It seems to me we need a lot more data that doesn't exist yet - and mechanism to collect that data. (CBECS etc are good, but the population and variability for bldgs of these types has a long way to go). 

I missing something about what's being proposed/talked about?

First of all the goal is not at all arbitrary but must be based on an expected outcome within a reasonable expectation. It is informed by data from similar, actual building energy consumption. I don?t think I need to explain the tools one can use to do this. 



Your goal (do the best you can) sounds like, ?let?s build an energy efficient building?. This is meaningless. Energy efficiency in the context of new construction is always relative and without a quantification of what energy efficient means this is no goal at all. 



Like any early stage performance goal the number is adjustable as more is discovered in the design process. If the target is later discovered to be unreasonable due to a wide range of potential issues, then the target is adjusted. 



If you pick your EUI goal the way you describe then yes this is a worthless goal but the key point is that it is never selected arbitrarily.

Not to be a jerk, but to ask an honest question: what is the point? I?ve been involved with ?established energy target? projects and never really picked up on the logic behind it ? I would appreciate a layman?s explanation. 



Put another way: If you select an arbitrary EUI or watts per square foot at the earliest stages of design, what have you gained in design process? If/when a project ?meets the goal? mid-design, are future design decisions supposed to de-emphasize energy impact (no!)? If on the other hand, a project finds that target unreasonable down the road, what then? 



Not setting a mile-marker like this implies designing the best building you can given the time/budget available and any other constraints? that seems more likely to result in the best end-result to me. 



To draw analogy, if design of a LEED (or any energy-conscious) project is like planning a road trip from Kansas to Florida, setting EUI goals seems something like choosing a rest stop by throwing a dart at the map blindfolded. It doesn?t help you get to your destination any more efficiently, it may be far out of the way, and now you?ve got a hole in the wall? what was the point? 



Okay, maybe a weak analogy ? chalking it up to a very long week =). Honestly, I?d appreciate someone laying the value behind this approach ? I?m expect the logic does exist, and I just haven?t yet seen the light!

Could any one advice why LEED would not put the base design as Watt per square foot, or per occupant, or per hotel bed etc. so the Architecture becomes more innovative early in the design to save energy?

Arpan, 



Based on the Weidt Group paper, I?m guessing you?re emphasizing architectural considerations that affect the energy cost vs. LEED points numbers. (The paper uses window-to-wall ratios and daylighting as an example.) I would think the goal during the programming and schematic design phases should be energy cost, not LEED points relative to the App. G baseline. Much of the energy cost savings vs. App. G baseline (EAc1 points) is going to come later from the mechanical and lighting designs. The suggestions in the paper to establish specific baseline building shapes and glazing percentages would add a LOT more modeling time ? you?d have to create two separate building geometries for the baseline and proposed models, not to mention different zoning patterns, space types, lighting power per space etc. 



For mechanical design, once the size and programming of the project is established, the baseline model properties are pretty well set, unless you consider fuel-switching and go between baseline systems 1/3/5/7 to systems 2/4/6/8. One exception I can think of for a design decision that results in higher energy cost but better comparison with the App. G baseline is higher ventilation rates combined with heat recovery in the proposed and no heat recovery in the baseline. 



Regards, 

Bill

Marcus, thank you incorporating this language. 





The one scenario we often see in our design guidance work is that a proposed design when compared with other design alternates does not necessarily provided the largest energy savings when compared against its own baseline case model. It is difficult to make a recommendation as consultants when we want to present the Owner with both real energy cost savings without compromising their LEED certification level targets. 


A recent paper presented by the Weidt Group at SimBuild touched on this issue:

If anyone has any good ideas about how to structure the LEED credits to end the practice of validation models at the end and encourage/require design phase modeling the folks on the USGBC EA TAG would love to hear them. The current proposed credit language from the first public comment phase is listed below. 



NC, CS, SCHOOLS, RETAIL, WAREHOUSE & DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, HOSPITALITY 

Establish an energy performance target no later than the schematic design phase. The target must be established as kBTU per square foot-year of source energy use. This target must be mapped on the same scale as the baseline and proposed buildings, if the project follows Option 1. 



OPTION 1. Whole Building Energy Simulation 

Analyze a minimum of at least nine efficiency measures during the design process and account for the results in design decision-making. Analysis can include energy simulation of efficiency opportunities, application of past energy simulation analyses for similar projects to the project, or application of published data from energy analyses performed for similar projects to the project (such as AEDGs). 



A minimum of six energy efficiency measures focused on load reduction strategies appropriate for the facility must be analyzed. This analysis must be performed during the schematic design phase. 



A minimum of three energy efficiency measures focused on HVAC related strategies must be analyzed (passive measures are acceptable). This analysis must be performed before the conclusion of the design development phase. 



The results of the analysis must be summarized in a brief report or memorandum. 





The next version of LEED will be going out for public comment again in July, I think, so please comment formally as well as discussing here.

OK, Carol..now you threw the "bait" out there..older than dirt, eh? 





I have done very limited LEED "type" modeling where you compare 20 walls and 40 windows types (well, it seemed that way). Correct me if I am wrong, but a Base model must be built to comply with a certain level of ASHRAE 90.1 (now up to 2010 ??). With all of the nuisances of eQuest 3.64, I am going to build the model from scrathc and put in all the relevant baseline data in by hand. And, by the way, the ASHRAE baseline model might be an entirely different system. I am just completing an EPACT evaluation (ASHRAE 90.1-2001) and the Baseline HVAC was screwe chillers, whereas the Actual building was packaged units with Turbocor compressors (ask me how I did that). 





It very much depends on the complexity of the building. A 40,000 sf office or a 500,000 sf hotel with casino facilites. 





I am unfamiliar with the LEED paperwork to be filled out after the modeling has been done. But I would not do anything of this type in under 120 hours, preferably 160 hours. If the client thinks he can do better, let him. 





Contingency, contingency. 





We won't discuss how old CAROL might be..

Marcus, 

You have inadvertently hit upon why IBPSA worked with ASHRAE to create a BEMP certification. That's Building Energy Modeling Professional (BEMP). 

Some of us who have been in the field for awhile began to worry a couple of years ago when so many new energy modelers began appearing on the listserv with questions. Their questions indicated a lack of training and experience that was worrisome. What made it worrisome was that they didn't seem to realize that they were as inexperienced as they were; they didn't appear to be pursuing training to learn how to do what they were doing; and we were uncertain as to how or if they were practicing quality control. We hoped that by creating a path to certification that we would give clients one more qualification to look for in their modelers. 

If you have been in this industry for any length of time, and by industry I mean the overall construction industry, you know that you don't get a lot of chances if your work doesn't pan out. If your energy model says I have a LEED Gold building and I'm going to save $4,000/year and what I really get is LEED Silver and $1,000/year, I am not going to be happy. So, I will probably not give you any more work but, even worse for all of us, I'll start expressing doubts about the whole process. LEED - what is it good for? 

So, now we all have more training, right? We read our ASHRAE Handbooks and technical manuals so we know how to model the difficult stuff. We can find any topic in the DOE2 Manuals, all of which are one line, available, and easily searchable. 

So now we are so good we can do these models in 40-80 hours. Really? Not me and I've been doing it longer than everyone, except you, John Aulbach. So I'm going to join Marcus in his rant because he's on to something. 

It's up to us to not under bid this work. It's up to us to educate our clients about the importance of quality in this process. If they think they are getting the same analysis in 40 hours that they used to get in 120 hours, they need to be led around to rethinking that and to be reminded that GIGO. 

Cheers, 

Carol

In our experience a final model, done right, would take about 80 hours. 



WARNING ? frustrated modeling rant to follow: 



Doing just a final model however completely misses the point as to why we model ? it is to guide design decisions! 



If I saw this RFP and all it asked me for was a model to determine LEED points, during or after design, I would try to educate the potential client about the purpose of modeling. 



Unfortunately too many projects pursuing LEED are only doing the minimum when it comes to modeling and almost completely missing all the benefits. Too often the ?market? transforms only based on a least first cost denominator basis that results in little real transformation. Doing models to determine LEED points does not transform the market, save any energy, and just circumvents the purpose behind LEED. (the next version actually requires design phase modeling!) 



Any ?modeler? who does only final models without attempting to explain to the owner why this is a bad idea should be ?drummed out of the corp? in my humble opinion. 



The problem is that if you respond to this RFP with 120 or 160 or more hours to really do the design phase modeling right, you will go up against the ?modeler? who claims to be able to do it in far less time. So how do we get the folks who issue the RFPs to ask for a proper scope of work so that they can compare fees on a level playing field? It is unfortunate that we are even having a discussion about doing modeling work in opposition to its purpose. 



Sorry for the rant but I feel better now. J

I would expect, for a building this size, approximately 40 hours (multiply by your hourly rate). The 40 hours include EAp2/EAc1 LEED documentation, and any review you may have to respond to later. 



Now, given that you have never done a LEED model, it will take you more time, possibly up to 40 more hours.

Greetings everyone, 



I have a question regarding the cost of an energy model for a LEED project. Every energy model I've done so far has been for 

existing buildings, mainly for optimization purposes. However, I received an RFP to model a five-story, 41,500 sq. ft. building 

that's currently on the design phase and is pursuing the LEED-NC Silver certification. I really have no idea what would be a fair 

price for this model since I'm going to have to use Appendix G (ASHRAE 90.1) to evaluate the difference between the base 

and proposed buildings. I don't know how much extra effort this will take. I know the procedure, just haven't done it before. 



Can you shed any light on this issue? 



Thanks in advance!

Your concerns make a lot of sense. I think theissue is to give Watt/sft, or per user, bed, etc. for the building envelop only without specialty equipment load. Usually, equipment selection for specialty buildings such as labs are not within the Architect or the HVAC engineer scope of work. This might be accounted for under different category if applicable.

While I conceptually agree with and understand the kbtu or watts/sf approach, to me, there seems to be some series issues with it in reality. 

First, I don't agree that generating or coming up with appropriate target values during design is always (or even frequently) an easy thing to do or easy data to find. It depends on your bldg type. I do a lot of labs and hospitals. Manufacturing and industrial use bldgs can have the same issues. Good EUI data is not easy to come by for these bldg types - partly because the user equipment that is installed in them can be a big portion of the energy demand and consumption and it's always changing and can be very specific to each client. For example: is it a community hosptial with more modest and generic care provide?....a state of the art hospital with specialized care functions?....does the lab have primarily biology or a chemistry functions....etc etc. These things all affect the EUI. In my opinion, the best resource for this data is actually utility companies based on data from similar customers, but that data is not generally publicly available and/or the population of similar comparable buildings may be small and difficult to relate to your bldg. 

Second, quite frankly, in my opinion, DESIGN phase energy models are poor predictors of ACTUAL bldg energy use. They are best at predicting RELATIVE (comparative) energy use. This is not because the tools are not good or inaccurate but because we and the owners are so poor at predicting how the bldg will actually be used, weather, etc. One additional factor, is what equipment will actually be installed. It's not uncommon for the technology to have changed bewteen the time that we start design and the time the equipment is actually purchased closer to the end of construction. All these things effect not only the equipment w/sf usage but the ac w/sf usage etc. So, there seems to me to be a serious disconnect to me if we talking about setting energy targets during DESIGNbased on statistical data of ACTUAL energy use and trying to use those figure during the design phase for predicted energy use. Again, I love the idea but are we really there yet in reality. It seems to me we need a lot more data that doesn't exist yet - and mechanism to collect that data. (CBECS etc are good, but the population and variability for bldgs of these types has a long way to go). 

I missing something about what's being proposed/talked about?

First of all the goal is not at all arbitrary but must be based on an expected outcome within a reasonable expectation. It is informed by data from similar, actual building energy consumption. I don?t think I need to explain the tools one can use to do this. 



Your goal (do the best you can) sounds like, ?let?s build an energy efficient building?. This is meaningless. Energy efficiency in the context of new construction is always relative and without a quantification of what energy efficient means this is no goal at all. 



Like any early stage performance goal the number is adjustable as more is discovered in the design process. If the target is later discovered to be unreasonable due to a wide range of potential issues, then the target is adjusted. 



If you pick your EUI goal the way you describe then yes this is a worthless goal but the key point is that it is never selected arbitrarily.

Not to be a jerk, but to ask an honest question: what is the point? I?ve been involved with ?established energy target? projects and never really picked up on the logic behind it ? I would appreciate a layman?s explanation. 



Put another way: If you select an arbitrary EUI or watts per square foot at the earliest stages of design, what have you gained in design process? If/when a project ?meets the goal? mid-design, are future design decisions supposed to de-emphasize energy impact (no!)? If on the other hand, a project finds that target unreasonable down the road, what then? 



Not setting a mile-marker like this implies designing the best building you can given the time/budget available and any other constraints? that seems more likely to result in the best end-result to me. 



To draw analogy, if design of a LEED (or any energy-conscious) project is like planning a road trip from Kansas to Florida, setting EUI goals seems something like choosing a rest stop by throwing a dart at the map blindfolded. It doesn?t help you get to your destination any more efficiently, it may be far out of the way, and now you?ve got a hole in the wall? what was the point? 



Okay, maybe a weak analogy ? chalking it up to a very long week =). Honestly, I?d appreciate someone laying the value behind this approach ? I?m expect the logic does exist, and I just haven?t yet seen the light!

Could any one advice why LEED would not put the base design as Watt per square foot, or per occupant, or per hotel bed etc. so the Architecture becomes more innovative early in the design to save energy?

Arpan, 



Based on the Weidt Group paper, I?m guessing you?re emphasizing architectural considerations that affect the energy cost vs. LEED points numbers. (The paper uses window-to-wall ratios and daylighting as an example.) I would think the goal during the programming and schematic design phases should be energy cost, not LEED points relative to the App. G baseline. Much of the energy cost savings vs. App. G baseline (EAc1 points) is going to come later from the mechanical and lighting designs. The suggestions in the paper to establish specific baseline building shapes and glazing percentages would add a LOT more modeling time ? you?d have to create two separate building geometries for the baseline and proposed models, not to mention different zoning patterns, space types, lighting power per space etc. 



For mechanical design, once the size and programming of the project is established, the baseline model properties are pretty well set, unless you consider fuel-switching and go between baseline systems 1/3/5/7 to systems 2/4/6/8. One exception I can think of for a design decision that results in higher energy cost but better comparison with the App. G baseline is higher ventilation rates combined with heat recovery in the proposed and no heat recovery in the baseline. 



Regards, 

Bill

Marcus, thank you incorporating this language. 





The one scenario we often see in our design guidance work is that a proposed design when compared with other design alternates does not necessarily provided the largest energy savings when compared against its own baseline case model. It is difficult to make a recommendation as consultants when we want to present the Owner with both real energy cost savings without compromising their LEED certification level targets. 


A recent paper presented by the Weidt Group at SimBuild touched on this issue:

If anyone has any good ideas about how to structure the LEED credits to end the practice of validation models at the end and encourage/require design phase modeling the folks on the USGBC EA TAG would love to hear them. The current proposed credit language from the first public comment phase is listed below. 



NC, CS, SCHOOLS, RETAIL, WAREHOUSE & DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, HOSPITALITY 

Establish an energy performance target no later than the schematic design phase. The target must be established as kBTU per square foot-year of source energy use. This target must be mapped on the same scale as the baseline and proposed buildings, if the project follows Option 1. 



OPTION 1. Whole Building Energy Simulation 

Analyze a minimum of at least nine efficiency measures during the design process and account for the results in design decision-making. Analysis can include energy simulation of efficiency opportunities, application of past energy simulation analyses for similar projects to the project, or application of published data from energy analyses performed for similar projects to the project (such as AEDGs). 



A minimum of six energy efficiency measures focused on load reduction strategies appropriate for the facility must be analyzed. This analysis must be performed during the schematic design phase. 



A minimum of three energy efficiency measures focused on HVAC related strategies must be analyzed (passive measures are acceptable). This analysis must be performed before the conclusion of the design development phase. 



The results of the analysis must be summarized in a brief report or memorandum. 





The next version of LEED will be going out for public comment again in July, I think, so please comment formally as well as discussing here.

OK, Carol..now you threw the "bait" out there..older than dirt, eh? 





I have done very limited LEED "type" modeling where you compare 20 walls and 40 windows types (well, it seemed that way). Correct me if I am wrong, but a Base model must be built to comply with a certain level of ASHRAE 90.1 (now up to 2010 ??). With all of the nuisances of eQuest 3.64, I am going to build the model from scrathc and put in all the relevant baseline data in by hand. And, by the way, the ASHRAE baseline model might be an entirely different system. I am just completing an EPACT evaluation (ASHRAE 90.1-2001) and the Baseline HVAC was screwe chillers, whereas the Actual building was packaged units with Turbocor compressors (ask me how I did that). 





It very much depends on the complexity of the building. A 40,000 sf office or a 500,000 sf hotel with casino facilites. 





I am unfamiliar with the LEED paperwork to be filled out after the modeling has been done. But I would not do anything of this type in under 120 hours, preferably 160 hours. If the client thinks he can do better, let him. 





Contingency, contingency. 





We won't discuss how old CAROL might be..

Marcus, 

You have inadvertently hit upon why IBPSA worked with ASHRAE to create a BEMP certification. That's Building Energy Modeling Professional (BEMP). 

Some of us who have been in the field for awhile began to worry a couple of years ago when so many new energy modelers began appearing on the listserv with questions. Their questions indicated a lack of training and experience that was worrisome. What made it worrisome was that they didn't seem to realize that they were as inexperienced as they were; they didn't appear to be pursuing training to learn how to do what they were doing; and we were uncertain as to how or if they were practicing quality control. We hoped that by creating a path to certification that we would give clients one more qualification to look for in their modelers. 

If you have been in this industry for any length of time, and by industry I mean the overall construction industry, you know that you don't get a lot of chances if your work doesn't pan out. If your energy model says I have a LEED Gold building and I'm going to save $4,000/year and what I really get is LEED Silver and $1,000/year, I am not going to be happy. So, I will probably not give you any more work but, even worse for all of us, I'll start expressing doubts about the whole process. LEED - what is it good for? 

So, now we all have more training, right? We read our ASHRAE Handbooks and technical manuals so we know how to model the difficult stuff. We can find any topic in the DOE2 Manuals, all of which are one line, available, and easily searchable. 

So now we are so good we can do these models in 40-80 hours. Really? Not me and I've been doing it longer than everyone, except you, John Aulbach. So I'm going to join Marcus in his rant because he's on to something. 

It's up to us to not under bid this work. It's up to us to educate our clients about the importance of quality in this process. If they think they are getting the same analysis in 40 hours that they used to get in 120 hours, they need to be led around to rethinking that and to be reminded that GIGO. 

Cheers, 

Carol

In our experience a final model, done right, would take about 80 hours. 



WARNING ? frustrated modeling rant to follow: 



Doing just a final model however completely misses the point as to why we model ? it is to guide design decisions! 



If I saw this RFP and all it asked me for was a model to determine LEED points, during or after design, I would try to educate the potential client about the purpose of modeling. 



Unfortunately too many projects pursuing LEED are only doing the minimum when it comes to modeling and almost completely missing all the benefits. Too often the ?market? transforms only based on a least first cost denominator basis that results in little real transformation. Doing models to determine LEED points does not transform the market, save any energy, and just circumvents the purpose behind LEED. (the next version actually requires design phase modeling!) 



Any ?modeler? who does only final models without attempting to explain to the owner why this is a bad idea should be ?drummed out of the corp? in my humble opinion. 



The problem is that if you respond to this RFP with 120 or 160 or more hours to really do the design phase modeling right, you will go up against the ?modeler? who claims to be able to do it in far less time. So how do we get the folks who issue the RFPs to ask for a proper scope of work so that they can compare fees on a level playing field? It is unfortunate that we are even having a discussion about doing modeling work in opposition to its purpose. 



Sorry for the rant but I feel better now. J

I would expect, for a building this size, approximately 40 hours (multiply by your hourly rate). The 40 hours include EAp2/EAc1 LEED documentation, and any review you may have to respond to later. 



Now, given that you have never done a LEED model, it will take you more time, possibly up to 40 more hours.

Greetings everyone, 



I have a question regarding the cost of an energy model for a LEED project. Every energy model I've done so far has been for 

existing buildings, mainly for optimization purposes. However, I received an RFP to model a five-story, 41,500 sq. ft. building 

that's currently on the design phase and is pursuing the LEED-NC Silver certification. I really have no idea what would be a fair 

price for this model since I'm going to have to use Appendix G (ASHRAE 90.1) to evaluate the difference between the base 

and proposed buildings. I don't know how much extra effort this will take. I know the procedure, just haven't done it before. 



Can you shed any light on this issue? 



Thanks in advance!

I?m not sure it is a completely fair comparison straight up ? many of the
LEED for New Construction projects that I see have extremely high demands
and expectations from their owners about productivity and features.  Many of
these that I have experience with are healthcare, higher education, and
laboratories, which as Julia B. mentioned have a huge impact from the
operational characteristics that can be influenced at the time of design,
but are only partially inside the sphere of influence for the architect and
engineers as the building operates.  Also lots of commercial high rises for
banking institutions with heavy computer loads.



Especially as the energy code squeezes the ?regulated? energies down to
lower and lower levels, the process energy usage becomes a greater percent
of the total which could be a major factor in why many of the buildings from
the study weren?t performing as modeled ? the energy end-use that is the
least influenced by the design team is becoming a larger percentage of the
total.



Since the energy savings percentage currently utilized is a relative
baseline, you may see some variations in absolute EUI between two
neighboring properties ? in fact I?d expect it!  If a building was going to
be required to save 10% versus 90.1 and a peer building was built nearby
that was ?equal? to 90.1, the variances in the process loads, system
mapping, building geometry, occupied hours, etc. could be just as important
variables than LEED registration or non-registration to determine which had
a higher EUI than the other.



It will be very difficult to account for the geometry and occupancy
variables when determining the proposed target EUIs.  Also how to even
choose the metric as a basis between site, source, energy cost ? this is
going to be very difficult to implement.  What about the Durst Organization
building that has cogen, heat recovery for absorption, and thermal
storage?definitely won?t fit this target EUI mold, but overall the
strategies were recommended and implemented by a savvy owner.



Specifically about the ?famous study? I could also make an argument that
relating to energy usage, there are certainly many designers (many of
ourselves on this list I hope!) that work on projects where we?re using
efficient systems and equipment as the basis regardless of LEED registration
? who is to say that an owner can?t make an initiative for an energy
efficient building without LEED certification?   90.1 and IECC have been
advancing quickly, and even the code minimum building built today should be
a pretty good performer.



So to make a long story short, I think the idea of having the EUI
conversation is good and agree that any EUI target would have to be subject
to adjustment, and that more emphasis/incentive should be placed on the EBOM
rating system as a tool for improving the operations of the buildings for
the remainder of their lifetimes.  I don?t see how EUI targets will work in
a formulaic/prescriptive way as part of a LEED credit or prerequisite in
place of the relative baseline we use now without a major change in how the
project is approached from the owners.  The larger goals should be
achievable without this step in my opinion, and having the discussions on an
individual project basis.

The primary purpose is to get the conversation started, early.  It is an
opportunity to educate the owner and the team about energy.  In my
experience the majority of designers can?t even tell you the metric for
comparing building energy consumption.  I have often had this conversation
early in the project design and have been met with blank stares.  It is
incumbent upon us who do understand these energy issues to get the
conversation started.  Caveat the heck out of the goal, explain the
limitations, discuss the relative vs absolute metrics, be open about the
issues ? so that we can raise awareness one conversation at a time.  This is
the power of a market transformation tool like LEED.  It enables us to have
these conversations.



I agree that both of these items are potential issues, talk to your clients
about them.  If you don?t have a goal, how do you measure success?

While I conceptually agree with and understand the kbtu or watts/sf
approach, to me, there seems to be some series issues with it in reality.

First, I don't agree that generating or coming up with appropriate target
values during design is always (or even frequently) an easy thing to do or
easy data to find.  It depends on your bldg type.  I do a lot of labs and
hospitals.  Manufacturing and industrial use bldgs can have the same
issues.  Good EUI data is not easy to come by for these bldg types - partly
because the user equipment that is installed in them can be a big portion of
the energy demand and consumption and it's always changing and can be very
specific to each client.  For example: is it a community hosptial with more
modest and generic care provide?....a state of the art hospital with
specialized care functions?....does the lab have primarily biology or a
chemistry functions....etc etc.  These things all affect the EUI.  In my
opinion, the best resource for this data is actually utility companies based
on data from similar customers, but that data is not generally publicly
available and/or the population of similar comparable buildings may be small
and difficult to relate to your bldg.

Second, quite frankly, in my opinion, DESIGN phase energy models are poor
predictors of ACTUAL bldg energy use.  They are best at predicting RELATIVE
(comparative) energy use.  This is not because the tools are not good or
inaccurate but because we and the owners are so poor at predicting how the
bldg will actually be used, weather, etc.  One additional factor, is what
equipment will actually be installed.  It's not uncommon for the technology
to have changed bewteen the time that we start design and the time the
equipment is actually purchased closer to the end of construction.  All
these things effect not only the equipment w/sf usage but the ac w/sf usage
etc.   So, there seems to me to be a serious disconnect to me if we talking
about setting energy targets during DESIGNbased on statistical data of
ACTUAL energy use and trying to use those figure during the design phase for
predicted energy use.  Again, I love the idea but are we really there yet in
reality.  It seems to me we need a lot more data that doesn't exist yet -
and mechanism to collect that data.  (CBECS etc are good, but the population
and variability for bldgs of these types has a long way to go).

I missing something about what's being proposed/talked about?

First of all the goal is not at all arbitrary but must be based on an
expected outcome within a reasonable expectation.  It is informed by data
from similar, actual building energy consumption.  I don?t think I need to
explain the tools one can use to do this.



Your goal (do the best you can) sounds like, ?let?s build an energy
efficient building?.  This is meaningless.  Energy efficiency in the context
of new construction is always relative and without a quantification of what
energy efficient means this is no goal at all.



Like any early stage performance goal the number is adjustable as more is
discovered in the design process.  If the target is later discovered to be
unreasonable due to a wide range of potential issues, then the target is
adjusted.



If you pick your EUI goal the way you describe then yes this is a worthless
goal but the key point is that it is never selected arbitrarily.

Not to be a jerk, but to ask an honest question: what is the point?  I?ve
been involved with ?established energy target? projects and never really
picked up on the logic behind it ? I would appreciate a layman?s
explanation.



Put another way:  If you select an arbitrary EUI or watts per square foot at
the earliest stages of design, what have you gained in design process?
If/when a project ?meets the goal? mid-design, are future design decisions
supposed to de-emphasize energy impact (no!)?  If on the other hand, a
project finds that target unreasonable down the road, what then?



Not setting a mile-marker like this implies designing the best building you
can given the time/budget available and any other constraints? that seems
more likely to result in the best end-result to me.



To draw analogy, if design of a LEED (or any energy-conscious) project is
like planning a road trip from Kansas to Florida, setting EUI goals seems
something like choosing a rest stop by throwing a dart at the map
blindfolded.  It doesn?t help you get to your destination any more
efficiently, it may be far out of the way, and now you?ve got a hole in the
wall? what was the point?



Okay, maybe a weak analogy ? chalking it up to a very long week =).
Honestly, I?d appreciate someone laying the value behind this approach ? I?m
expect the logic does exist, and I just haven?t yet seen the light!

Yes I think it is the same study which showed LEED buildings were 25% to 30% more energy efficient than average.  There was considerable debate about the interpretation of the data.

 

The purpose of my post was how do we get folks to use modeling on LEED project to make them more energy efficient.  Some folks just complain about LEED without offering a better alternative.  USGBC is seeking your good ideas to make it better, more useful and effective.

Arpan,

 

Based on the Weidt Group paper, I?m guessing you?re emphasizing architectural considerations that affect the energy cost vs. LEED points numbers. (The paper uses window-to-wall ratios and daylighting as an example.) I would think the goal during the programming and schematic design phases should be energy cost, not LEED points relative to the App. G baseline. Much of the energy cost savings vs. App. G baseline (EAc1 points) is going to come later from the mechanical and lighting designs. The suggestions in the paper to establish specific baseline building shapes and glazing percentages would add a LOT more modeling time ? you?d have to create two separate building geometries for the baseline and proposed models, not to mention different zoning patterns, space types, lighting power per space etc.

 

For mechanical design, once the size and programming of the project is established, the baseline model properties are pretty well set, unless you consider fuel-switching and go between baseline systems 1/3/5/7 to systems 2/4/6/8. One exception I can think of for a design decision that results in higher energy cost but better comparison with the App. G baseline is higher ventilation rates combined with heat recovery in the proposed and no heat recovery in the baseline.

 

Regards,

Bill

Marcus, thank you incorporating this language.

 

The one scenario we often see in our design guidance work is that a proposed design when compared with other design alternates does not necessarily provided the largest energy savings when compared against its own baseline case model. It is difficult to make a recommendation as consultants when we want to present the Owner with both real energy cost savings without compromising their LEED certification level targets.  

A recent paper presented by the Weidt Group at SimBuild touched on this issue:

If anyone has any good ideas about how to structure the LEED credits to end the practice of validation models at the end and encourage/require design phase modeling the folks on the USGBC EA TAG would love to hear them.  The current proposed credit language from the first public comment phase is listed below.

 

NC, CS, SCHOOLS, RETAIL, WAREHOUSE & DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, HOSPITALITY

Establish an energy performance target no later than the schematic design phase. The target must be established as kBTU per square foot-year of source energy use. This target must be mapped on the same scale as the baseline and proposed buildings, if the project follows Option 1.

 

OPTION 1. Whole Building Energy Simulation 

Analyze a minimum of at least nine efficiency measures during the design process and account for the results in design decision-making. Analysis can include energy simulation of efficiency opportunities, application of past energy simulation analyses for similar projects to the project, or application of published data from energy analyses performed for similar projects to the project (such as AEDGs).

 

A minimum of six energy efficiency measures focused on load reduction strategies appropriate for the facility must be analyzed. This analysis must be performed during the schematic design phase.

 

A minimum of three energy efficiency measures focused on HVAC related strategies must be analyzed (passive measures are acceptable). This analysis must be performed before the conclusion of the design development phase.

 

The results of the analysis must be summarized in a brief report or memorandum.

 

 

The next version of LEED will be going out for public comment again in July, I think, so please comment formally as well as discussing here.

OK, Carol..now you threw the "bait" out there..older than dirt, eh?

 

I have done very limited LEED "type" modeling where you compare 20 walls and 40 windows types (well, it seemed that way). Correct me if I am wrong, but a Base model must be built to comply with a certain level of ASHRAE 90.1 (now up to 2010 ??). With all of the nuisances of eQuest 3.64, I am going to build the model from scrathc and put in all the relevant baseline data in by hand.  And, by the way, the ASHRAE baseline model might be an entirely different system.  I am just completing an EPACT evaluation (ASHRAE 90.1-2001) and the Baseline HVAC was screwe chillers, whereas the Actual building was packaged units with Turbocor compressors (ask me how I did that).

 

It very much depends on the complexity of the building. A 40,000 sf office or a 500,000 sf hotel with casino facilites.

 

I am unfamiliar with the LEED paperwork to be filled out after the modeling has been done. But I would not do anything of this type in under 120 hours, preferably 160 hours. If the client thinks he can do better, let him.

 

Contingency, contingency.

 

We won't discuss how old CAROL might be..

Marcus,

You have inadvertently hit upon why IBPSA worked with ASHRAE to create a BEMP certification. That's Building Energy Modeling Professional (BEMP). 

Some of us who have been in the field for awhile began to worry a couple of years ago when so many new energy modelers began appearing on the listserv with questions. Their questions indicated a lack of training and experience that was worrisome. What made it worrisome was that they didn't seem to realize that they were as inexperienced as they were; they didn't appear to be pursuing training to learn how to do what they were doing; and we were uncertain as to how or if they were practicing quality control. We hoped that by creating a path to certification that we would give clients one more qualification to look for in their modelers.

If you have been in this industry for any length of time, and by industry I mean the overall construction industry, you know that you don't get a lot of chances if your work doesn't pan out. If your energy model says I have a LEED Gold building and I'm going to save $4,000/year and what I really get is LEED Silver and $1,000/year, I am not going to be happy. So, I will probably not give you any more work but, even worse for all of us, I'll start expressing doubts about the whole process. LEED - what is it good for?

So, now we all have more training, right? We read our ASHRAE Handbooks and technical manuals so we know how to model the difficult stuff. We can find any topic in the DOE2 Manuals, all of which are one line, available, and easily searchable. 

So now we are so good we can do these models in 40-80 hours. Really? Not me and I've been doing it longer than everyone, except you, John Aulbach. So I'm going to join Marcus in his rant because he's on to something.

It's up to us to not under bid this work. It's up to us to educate our clients about the importance of quality in this process. If they think they are getting the same analysis in 40 hours that they used to get in 120 hours, they need to be led around to rethinking that and to be reminded that GIGO.

Cheers,

Carol

In our experience a final model, done right, would take about 80 hours.

 

WARNING ? frustrated modeling rant to follow:

 

Doing just a final model however completely misses the point as to why we model ? it is to guide design decisions!  

 

If I saw this RFP and all it asked me for was a model to determine LEED points, during or after design, I would try to educate the potential client about the purpose of modeling.

 

Unfortunately too many projects pursuing LEED are only doing the minimum when it comes to modeling and almost completely missing all the benefits.  Too often the ?market? transforms only based on a least first cost denominator basis that results in little real transformation.  Doing models to determine LEED points does not transform the market, save any energy, and just circumvents the purpose behind LEED. (the next version actually requires design phase modeling!)

 

Any ?modeler? who does only final models without attempting to explain to the owner why this is a bad idea should be ?drummed out of the corp? in my humble opinion.

 

The problem is that if you respond to this RFP with 120 or 160 or more hours to really do the design phase modeling right, you will go up against the ?modeler? who claims to be able to do it in far less time.  So how do we get the folks who issue the RFPs to ask for a proper scope of work so that they can compare fees on a level playing field?  It is unfortunate that we are even having a discussion about doing modeling work in opposition to its purpose.

 

Sorry for the rant but I feel better now. J

Omar,

 

I would expect, for a building this size, approximately 40 hours (multiply by your hourly rate). The 40 hours include EAp2/EAc1 LEED documentation, and any review you may have to respond to later.

 

Now, given that you have never done a LEED model, it will take you more time, possibly up to 40 more hours.

Greetings everyone,

 

I have a question regarding the cost of an energy model for a LEED project. Every energy model I've done so far has been for 

existing buildings, mainly for optimization purposes. However, I received an RFP to model a five-story, 41,500 sq. ft. building

that's currently on the design phase and is pursuing the LEED-NC Silver certification. I really have no idea what would be a fair 

price for this model since I'm going to have to use Appendix G (ASHRAE 90.1) to evaluate the difference between the base 

and proposed buildings. I don't know how much extra effort this will take. I know the procedure, just haven't done it before.

 

Can you shed any light on this issue?

 

Thanks in advance!

Message-ID: <1AEDEECB91FA7646B3E635ED4CE8A83B0A353E3B@HLMAILSERVER2.hoarelea.local>

Which software package would you recommend for ASHRAE 90.1 modelling? 

 

At the moment I'm thinking:

 

-          IES: more user friendly and likely to be quicker especially
with complex geometries, but expensive (we already use IES but would
have to pay for the ASHRAE 90.1 navigator and related modules and
training, support)

-          EQUEST - less automated and less suited to complex geometries
but cheaper and maybe designed more for ASHRAE modelling, less support
(but maybe more support from other users as software is widely used),
based on 'British' units (we are in UK so this means we generally have
to convert units)

-          Tas - slow and clunky but gets there in the end, bit of a
non-runner in the long term for ASHRAE as you have to build all the
buildings manually, unless they actually release the long-promised
ASHRAE plug in

Claire,
I believe that you have to use ApHVAC for A90.1 modelling in IES. Some 
people find this quite challenging.

I guess this is where I enter this interesting discussion.  The selection of an EUI should definitely not be arbitrary.  In fact, the LEED-EB rating system already provides a good example of how to choose an appropriate target EUI: Energy Star.  Target Finder can be used for this, or you can build your own spreadsheet from the technical descriptions at http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=evaluate_performance.bus_portfoliomanager_model_tech_desc.  Most of the variables you need to set the target EUI are schematic level: anticipated hours of operation, gross floor area, number of occupants, HDD/CDD.

 

At the same time, looking at the AIA design milestones, I would be concerned if a project experiences changes that have a significant impact on energy consumption after 75% CD, maybe even 50% CD depending on the project.  I could see a late decision to use MERV 13 filters causing an increase in fan energy, but that decision can also be mitigated through other variables such as filter surface area.

 

There needs to be some change to the process to prioritize the right decisions first.  Energy needs to be part of the decision model for a building at the early phases of the project, part of site selection for projects that are defined that way or part of the pro forma for developments that start with a fixed site.  In many cases, it is part of those, but with no connection to the remainder of the decision model.

 

On your analogy, Nick, I?d suggest that using a goal of designing the best building possible within time/budget constraints is more akin to just getting in a car and driving.  Who?s to judge if you actually arrive at your destination?  You might be able to say you had a good trip and the drive was a success, but would it have been more successful if you knew where you were going and how to get there most efficiently?  However, starting with a destination in mind allows you to better plan your trip from a time/budget perspective.  Just having an EUI goal doesn?t mean that you ignore the energy impact of decisions.  It just means that you have another criteria to let you know if you?re making the right decision.  The flip side is also true: if a decision is made late in the design that negatively affects EUI, you can catch it.  The EUI goal is more like having a GPS on your driving trip, letting you know if you make a wrong turn along the way.

First of all the goal is not at all arbitrary but must be based on an expected outcome within a reasonable expectation.  It is informed by data from similar, actual building energy consumption.  I don?t think I need to explain the tools one can use to do this.

 

Your goal (do the best you can) sounds like, ?let?s build an energy efficient building?.  This is meaningless.  Energy efficiency in the context of new construction is always relative and without a quantification of what energy efficient means this is no goal at all.

 

Like any early stage performance goal the number is adjustable as more is discovered in the design process.  If the target is later discovered to be unreasonable due to a wide range of potential issues, then the target is adjusted.

 

If you pick your EUI goal the way you describe then yes this is a worthless goal but the key point is that it is never selected arbitrarily.

Not to be a jerk, but to ask an honest question: what is the point?  I?ve been involved with ?established energy target? projects and never really picked up on the logic behind it ? I would appreciate a layman?s explanation.

 

Put another way:  If you select an arbitrary EUI or watts per square foot at the earliest stages of design, what have you gained in design process?  If/when a project ?meets the goal? mid-design, are future design decisions supposed to de-emphasize energy impact (no!)?  If on the other hand, a project finds that target unreasonable down the road, what then?  

 

Not setting a mile-marker like this implies designing the best building you can given the time/budget available and any other constraints? that seems more likely to result in the best end-result to me.

 

To draw analogy, if design of a LEED (or any energy-conscious) project is like planning a road trip from Kansas to Florida, setting EUI goals seems something like choosing a rest stop by throwing a dart at the map blindfolded.  It doesn?t help you get to your destination any more efficiently, it may be far out of the way, and now you?ve got a hole in the wall? what was the point?

 

Okay, maybe a weak analogy ? chalking it up to a very long week =).  Honestly, I?d appreciate someone laying the value behind this approach ? I?m expect the logic does exist, and I just haven?t yet seen the light!

Could any one advice why LEED would not put the base design as Watt per square foot, or per occupant, or per hotel bed etc. so the Architecture becomes more innovative early in the design to save energy?

Arpan,

 

Based on the Weidt Group paper, I?m guessing you?re emphasizing architectural considerations that affect the energy cost vs. LEED points numbers. (The paper uses window-to-wall ratios and daylighting as an example.) I would think the goal during the programming and schematic design phases should be energy cost, not LEED points relative to the App. G baseline. Much of the energy cost savings vs. App. G baseline (EAc1 points) is going to come later from the mechanical and lighting designs. The suggestions in the paper to establish specific baseline building shapes and glazing percentages would add a LOT more modeling time ? you?d have to create two separate building geometries for the baseline and proposed models, not to mention different zoning patterns, space types, lighting power per space etc.

 

For mechanical design, once the size and programming of the project is established, the baseline model properties are pretty well set, unless you consider fuel-switching and go between baseline systems 1/3/5/7 to systems 2/4/6/8. One exception I can think of for a design decision that results in higher energy cost but better comparison with the App. G baseline is higher ventilation rates combined with heat recovery in the proposed and no heat recovery in the baseline.

 

Regards,

Bill

Marcus, thank you incorporating this language.

 

The one scenario we often see in our design guidance work is that a proposed design when compared with other design alternates does not necessarily provided the largest energy savings when compared against its own baseline case model. It is difficult to make a recommendation as consultants when we want to present the Owner with both real energy cost savings without compromising their LEED certification level targets.  

A recent paper presented by the Weidt Group at SimBuild touched on this issue:

Analysis can include energy simulation of efficiency opportunities, application of past energy simulation analyses for similar projects to the project, or application of published data from energy analyses performed for similar projects to the project (such as AEDGs).

	 

	A minimum of six energy efficiency measures focused on load reduction strategies appropriate for the facility must be analyzed. This analysis must be performed during the schematic design phase.

	 

	A minimum of three energy efficiency measures focused on HVAC related strategies must be analyzed (passive measures are acceptable). This analysis must be performed before the conclusion of the design development phase.

	 

	The results of the analysis must be summarized in a brief report or memorandum.

	 

	 

	The next version of LEED will be going out for public comment again in July, I think, so please comment formally as well as discussing here.

	OK, Carol..now you threw the "bait" out there..older than dirt, eh?

	 

	I have done very limited LEED "type" modeling where you compare 20 walls and 40 windows types (well, it seemed that way). Correct me if I am wrong, but a Base model must be built to comply with a certain level of ASHRAE 90.1 (now up to 2010 ??). With all of the nuisances of eQuest 3.64, I am going to build the model from scrathc and put in all the relevant baseline data in by hand.  And, by the way, the ASHRAE baseline model might be an entirely different system.  I am just completing an EPACT evaluation (ASHRAE 90.1-2001) and the Baseline HVAC was screwe chillers, whereas the Actual building was packaged units with Turbocor compressors (ask me how I did that).

	 

	It very much depends on the complexity of the building. A 40,000 sf office or a 500,000 sf hotel with casino facilites.

	 

	I am unfamiliar with the LEED paperwork to be filled out after the modeling has been done. But I would not do anything of this type in under 120 hours, preferably 160 hours. If the client thinks he can do better, let him.

	 

	Contingency, contingency.

	 

	We won't discuss how old CAROL might be..

	Marcus,
	
	You have inadvertently hit upon why IBPSA worked with ASHRAE to create a BEMP certification. That's Building Energy Modeling Professional (BEMP). 
	
	Some of us who have been in the field for awhile began to worry a couple of years ago when so many new energy modelers began appearing on the listserv with questions. Their questions indicated a lack of training and experience that was worrisome. What made it worrisome was that they didn't seem to realize that they were as inexperienced as they were; they didn't appear to be pursuing training to learn how to do what they were doing; and we were uncertain as to how or if they were practicing quality control. We hoped that by creating a path to certification that we would give clients one more qualification to look for in their modelers.
	
	If you have been in this industry for any length of time, and by industry I mean the overall construction industry, you know that you don't get a lot of chances if your work doesn't pan out. If your energy model says I have a LEED Gold building and I'm going to save $4,000/year and what I really get is LEED Silver and $1,000/year, I am not going to be happy. So, I will probably not give you any more work but, even worse for all of us, I'll start expressing doubts about the whole process. LEED - what is it good for?
	
	So, now we all have more training, right? We read our ASHRAE Handbooks and technical manuals so we know how to model the difficult stuff. We can find any topic in the DOE2 Manuals, all of which are one line, available, and easily searchable. 
	
	So now we are so good we can do these models in 40-80 hours. Really? Not me and I've been doing it longer than everyone, except you, John Aulbach. So I'm going to join Marcus in his rant because he's on to something.
	
	It's up to us to not under bid this work. It's up to us to educate our clients about the importance of quality in this process. If they think they are getting the same analysis in 40 hours that they used to get in 120 hours, they need to be led around to rethinking that and to be reminded that GIGO.
	
	Cheers,
	
	Carol

		Unfortunately too many projects pursuing LEED are only doing the minimum when it comes to modeling and almost completely missing all the benefits.  Too often the ?market? transforms only based on a least first cost denominator basis that results in little real transformation.  Doing models to determine LEED points does not transform the market, save any energy, and just circumvents the purpose behind LEED. (the next version actually requires design phase modeling!)

		 

		Any ?modeler? who does only final models without attempting to explain to the owner why this is a bad idea should be ?drummed out of the corp? in my humble opinion.

		 

		The problem is that if you respond to this RFP with 120 or 160 or more hours to really do the design phase modeling right, you will go up against the ?modeler? who claims to be able to do it in far less time.  So how do we get the folks who issue the RFPs to ask for a proper scope of work so that they can compare fees on a level playing field?  It is unfortunate that we are even having a discussion about doing modeling work in opposition to its purpose.

The primary purpose is to get the conversation started, early.  It is an
opportunity to educate the owner and the team about energy.  In my experience
the majority of designers can?t even tell you the metric for comparing
building energy consumption.  I have often had this conversation early in the
project design and have been met with blank stares.  It is incumbent upon us
who do understand these energy issues to get the conversation started.
Caveat the heck out of the goal, explain the limitations, discuss the
relative vs absolute metrics, be open about the issues ? so that we can raise
awareness one conversation at a time.  This is the power of a market
transformation tool like LEED.  It enables us to have these conversations.

 

I agree that both of these items are potential issues, talk to your clients
about them.  If you don?t have a goal, how do you measure success?

While I conceptually agree with and understand the kbtu or watts/sf approach,
to me, there seems to be some series issues with it in reality.

First, I don't agree that generating or coming up with appropriate target
values during design is always (or even frequently) an easy thing to do or
easy data to find.  It depends on your bldg type.  I do a lot of labs and
hospitals.  Manufacturing and industrial use bldgs can have the same issues.
Good EUI data is not easy to come by for these bldg types - partly because
the user equipment that is installed in them can be a big portion of the
energy demand and consumption and it's always changing and can be very
specific to each client.  For example: is it a community hosptial with more
modest and generic care provide?....a state of the art hospital with
specialized care functions?....does the lab have primarily biology or a
chemistry functions....etc etc.  These things all affect the EUI.  In my
opinion, the best resource for this data is actually utility companies based
on data from similar customers, but that data is not generally publicly
available and/or the population of similar comparable buildings may be small
and difficult to relate to your bldg.  

Second, quite frankly, in my opinion, DESIGN phase energy models are poor
predictors of ACTUAL bldg energy use.  They are best at predicting RELATIVE
(comparative) energy use.  This is not because the tools are not good or
inaccurate but because we and the owners are so poor at predicting how the
bldg will actually be used, weather, etc.  One additional factor, is what
equipment will actually be installed.  It's not uncommon for the technology
to have changed bewteen the time that we start design and the time the
equipment is actually purchased closer to the end of construction.  All these
things effect not only the equipment w/sf usage but the ac w/sf usage etc.
So, there seems to me to be a serious disconnect to me if we talking about
setting energy targets during DESIGNbased on statistical data of ACTUAL
energy use and trying to use those figure during the design phase for
predicted energy use.  Again, I love the idea but are we really there yet in
reality.  It seems to me we need a lot more data that doesn't exist yet - and
mechanism to collect that data.  (CBECS etc are good, but the population and
variability for bldgs of these types has a long way to go).

I missing something about what's being proposed/talked about?

First of all the goal is not at all arbitrary but must be based on an
expected outcome within a reasonable expectation.  It is informed by data
from similar, actual building energy consumption.  I don?t think I need to
explain the tools one can use to do this.

 

Your goal (do the best you can) sounds like, ?let?s build an energy efficient
building?.  This is meaningless.  Energy efficiency in the context of new
construction is always relative and without a quantification of what energy
efficient means this is no goal at all.

 

Like any early stage performance goal the number is adjustable as more is
discovered in the design process.  If the target is later discovered to be
unreasonable due to a wide range of potential issues, then the target is
adjusted.

 

If you pick your EUI goal the way you describe then yes this is a worthless
goal but the key point is that it is never selected arbitrarily.

Not to be a jerk, but to ask an honest question: what is the point?  I?ve
been involved with ?established energy target? projects and never really
picked up on the logic behind it ? I would appreciate a layman?s explanation.

 

Put another way:  If you select an arbitrary EUI or watts per square foot at
the earliest stages of design, what have you gained in design process?
If/when a project ?meets the goal? mid-design, are future design decisions
supposed to de-emphasize energy impact (no!)?  If on the other hand, a
project finds that target unreasonable down the road, what then?  

 

Not setting a mile-marker like this implies designing the best building you
can given the time/budget available and any other constraints? that seems
more likely to result in the best end-result to me.

 

To draw analogy, if design of a LEED (or any energy-conscious) project is
like planning a road trip from Kansas to Florida, setting EUI goals seems
something like choosing a rest stop by throwing a dart at the map
blindfolded.  It doesn?t help you get to your destination any more
efficiently, it may be far out of the way, and now you?ve got a hole in the
wall? what was the point?

 

Okay, maybe a weak analogy ? chalking it up to a very long week =).
Honestly, I?d appreciate someone laying the value behind this approach ? I?m
expect the logic does exist, and I just haven?t yet seen the light!

Agreed.  The new credit language for the next version of LEED does ask

Arpan,

 

Based on the Weidt Group paper, I?m guessing you?re emphasizing architectural
considerations that affect the energy cost vs. LEED points numbers. (The
paper uses window-to-wall ratios and daylighting as an example.) I would
think the goal during the programming and schematic design phases should be
energy cost, not LEED points relative to the App. G baseline. Much of the
energy cost savings vs. App. G baseline (EAc1 points) is going to come later
from the mechanical and lighting designs. The suggestions in the paper to
establish specific baseline building shapes and glazing percentages would add
a LOT more modeling time ? you?d have to create two separate building
geometries for the baseline and proposed models, not to mention different
zoning patterns, space types, lighting power per space etc.

 

For mechanical design, once the size and programming of the project is
established, the baseline model properties are pretty well set, unless you
consider fuel-switching and go between baseline systems 1/3/5/7 to systems
2/4/6/8. One exception I can think of for a design decision that results in
higher energy cost but better comparison with the App. G baseline is higher
ventilation rates combined with heat recovery in the proposed and no heat
recovery in the baseline.

Bill

Marcus, thank you incorporating this language.

 

The one scenario we often see in our design guidance work is that a proposed
design when compared with other design alternates does not necessarily
provided the largest energy savings when compared against its own baseline
case model. It is difficult to make a recommendation as consultants when we
want to present the Owner with both real energy cost savings without
compromising their LEED certification level targets.

issue:

listed below.

	 

	NC, CS, SCHOOLS, RETAIL, WAREHOUSE & DISTRIBUTION CENTERS,

	Establish an energy performance target no later than the schematic
design phase. The target must be established as kBTU per square foot-year of
source energy use. This target must be mapped on the same scale as the
baseline and proposed buildings, if the project follows Option 1.

	 

	OPTION 1. Whole Building Energy Simulation 

	Analyze a minimum of at least nine efficiency measures during the
design process and account for the results in design decision-making.
Analysis can include energy simulation of efficiency opportunities,
application of past energy simulation analyses for similar projects to the
project, or application of published data from energy analyses performed for
similar projects to the project (such as AEDGs).

	 

	A minimum of six energy efficiency measures focused on load reduction
strategies appropriate for the facility must be analyzed. This analysis must
be performed during the schematic design phase.

	 

	A minimum of three energy efficiency measures focused on HVAC related
strategies must be analyzed (passive measures are acceptable). This analysis
must be performed before the conclusion of the design development phase.

	 

	The results of the analysis must be summarized in a brief report or
memorandum.

	 

	 

	The next version of LEED will be going out for public comment again
in July, I think, so please comment formally as well as discussing here.

	OK, Carol..now you threw the "bait" out there..older than dirt, eh?

	 

	I have done very limited LEED "type" modeling where you compare 20
walls and 40 windows types (well, it seemed that way). Correct me if I am
wrong, but a Base model must be built to comply with a certain level of
ASHRAE 90.1 (now up to 2010 ??). With all of the nuisances of eQuest 3.64, I
am going to build the model from scrathc and put in all the relevant baseline
data in by hand.  And, by the way, the ASHRAE baseline model might be an
entirely different system.  I am just completing an EPACT evaluation (ASHRAE
90.1-2001) and the Baseline HVAC was screwe chillers, whereas the Actual
building was packaged units with Turbocor compressors (ask me how I did
that).

	 

	It very much depends on the complexity of the building. A 40,000 sf
office or a 500,000 sf hotel with casino facilites.

	 

	I am unfamiliar with the LEED paperwork to be filled out after the
modeling has been done. But I would not do anything of this type in under 120
hours, preferably 160 hours. If the client thinks he can do better, let him.

	 

	Contingency, contingency.

	Marcus,
	
	You have inadvertently hit upon why IBPSA worked with ASHRAE to
create a BEMP certification. That's Building Energy Modeling Professional
(BEMP). 
	
	Some of us who have been in the field for awhile began to worry a
couple of years ago when so many new energy modelers began appearing on the
listserv with questions. Their questions indicated a lack of training and
experience that was worrisome. What made it worrisome was that they didn't
seem to realize that they were as inexperienced as they were; they didn't
appear to be pursuing training to learn how to do what they were doing; and
we were uncertain as to how or if they were practicing quality control. We
hoped that by creating a path to certification that we would give clients one
more qualification to look for in their modelers.
	
	If you have been in this industry for any length of time, and by
industry I mean the overall construction industry, you know that you don't
get a lot of chances if your work doesn't pan out. If your energy model says
I have a LEED Gold building and I'm going to save $4,000/year and what I
really get is LEED Silver and $1,000/year, I am not going to be happy. So, I
will probably not give you any more work but, even worse for all of us, I'll
start expressing doubts about the whole process. LEED - what is it good for?
	
	So, now we all have more training, right? We read our ASHRAE
Handbooks and technical manuals so we know how to model the difficult stuff.
We can find any topic in the DOE2 Manuals, all of which are one line,
available, and easily searchable. 
	
	So now we are so good we can do these models in 40-80 hours. Really?
Not me and I've been doing it longer than everyone, except you, John Aulbach.
So I'm going to join Marcus in his rant because he's on to something.
	
	It's up to us to not under bid this work. It's up to us to educate
our clients about the importance of quality in this process. If they think
they are getting the same analysis in 40 hours that they used to get in 120
hours, they need to be led around to rethinking that and to be reminded that
GIGO.
	
	Cheers,

just circumvents the purpose behind LEED. (the next version actually requires
design phase modeling!)

		 

		Any ?modeler? who does only final models without attempting

		The problem is that if you respond to this RFP with 120 or
160 or more hours to really do the design phase modeling right, you will go
up against the ?modeler? who claims to be able to do it in far less time.  So
how do we get the folks who issue the RFPs to ask for a proper scope of work
so that they can compare fees on a level playing field?  It is unfortunate
that we are even having a discussion about doing modeling work in opposition
to its purpose.

The primary purpose is to get the conversation started, early.  It is an
opportunity to educate the owner and the team about energy.  In my experience
the majority of designers can?t even tell you the metric for comparing
building energy consumption.  I have often had this conversation early in the
project design and have been met with blank stares.  It is incumbent upon us
who do understand these energy issues to get the conversation started.
Caveat the heck out of the goal, explain the limitations, discuss the
relative vs absolute metrics, be open about the issues ? so that we can raise
awareness one conversation at a time.  This is the power of a market
transformation tool like LEED.  It enables us to have these conversations.

 

I agree that both of these items are potential issues, talk to your clients
about them.  If you don?t have a goal, how do you measure success?

While I conceptually agree with and understand the kbtu or watts/sf approach,
to me, there seems to be some series issues with it in reality.

First, I don't agree that generating or coming up with appropriate target
values during design is always (or even frequently) an easy thing to do or
easy data to find.  It depends on your bldg type.  I do a lot of labs and
hospitals.  Manufacturing and industrial use bldgs can have the same issues.
Good EUI data is not easy to come by for these bldg types - partly because
the user equipment that is installed in them can be a big portion of the
energy demand and consumption and it's always changing and can be very
specific to each client.  For example: is it a community hosptial with more
modest and generic care provide?....a state of the art hospital with
specialized care functions?....does the lab have primarily biology or a
chemistry functions....etc etc.  These things all affect the EUI.  In my
opinion, the best resource for this data is actually utility companies based
on data from similar customers, but that data is not generally publicly
available and/or the population of similar comparable buildings may be small
and difficult to relate to your bldg.  

Second, quite frankly, in my opinion, DESIGN phase energy models are poor
predictors of ACTUAL bldg energy use.  They are best at predicting RELATIVE
(comparative) energy use.  This is not because the tools are not good or
inaccurate but because we and the owners are so poor at predicting how the
bldg will actually be used, weather, etc.  One additional factor, is what
equipment will actually be installed.  It's not uncommon for the technology
to have changed bewteen the time that we start design and the time the
equipment is actually purchased closer to the end of construction.  All these
things effect not only the equipment w/sf usage but the ac w/sf usage etc.
So, there seems to me to be a serious disconnect to me if we talking about
setting energy targets during DESIGNbased on statistical data of ACTUAL
energy use and trying to use those figure during the design phase for
predicted energy use.  Again, I love the idea but are we really there yet in
reality.  It seems to me we need a lot more data that doesn't exist yet - and
mechanism to collect that data.  (CBECS etc are good, but the population and
variability for bldgs of these types has a long way to go).

I missing something about what's being proposed/talked about?

First of all the goal is not at all arbitrary but must be based on an
expected outcome within a reasonable expectation.  It is informed by data
from similar, actual building energy consumption.  I don?t think I need to
explain the tools one can use to do this.

 

Your goal (do the best you can) sounds like, ?let?s build an energy efficient
building?.  This is meaningless.  Energy efficiency in the context of new
construction is always relative and without a quantification of what energy
efficient means this is no goal at all.

 

Like any early stage performance goal the number is adjustable as more is
discovered in the design process.  If the target is later discovered to be
unreasonable due to a wide range of potential issues, then the target is
adjusted.

 

If you pick your EUI goal the way you describe then yes this is a worthless
goal but the key point is that it is never selected arbitrarily.

Not to be a jerk, but to ask an honest question: what is the point?  I?ve
been involved with ?established energy target? projects and never really
picked up on the logic behind it ? I would appreciate a layman?s explanation.

 

Put another way:  If you select an arbitrary EUI or watts per square foot at
the earliest stages of design, what have you gained in design process?
If/when a project ?meets the goal? mid-design, are future design decisions
supposed to de-emphasize energy impact (no!)?  If on the other hand, a
project finds that target unreasonable down the road, what then?  

 

Not setting a mile-marker like this implies designing the best building you
can given the time/budget available and any other constraints? that seems
more likely to result in the best end-result to me.

 

To draw analogy, if design of a LEED (or any energy-conscious) project is
like planning a road trip from Kansas to Florida, setting EUI goals seems
something like choosing a rest stop by throwing a dart at the map
blindfolded.  It doesn?t help you get to your destination any more
efficiently, it may be far out of the way, and now you?ve got a hole in the
wall? what was the point?

 

Okay, maybe a weak analogy ? chalking it up to a very long week =).
Honestly, I?d appreciate someone laying the value behind this approach ? I?m
expect the logic does exist, and I just haven?t yet seen the light!

Agreed.  The new credit language for the next version of LEED does ask
project teams to establish an absolute performance goal.

Could any one advice why LEED would not put the base design as Watt per
square foot, or per occupant, or per hotel bed etc. so the Architecture
becomes more innovative early in the design to save energy?

Arpan,

 

Based on the Weidt Group paper, I?m guessing you?re emphasizing architectural
considerations that affect the energy cost vs. LEED points numbers. (The
paper uses window-to-wall ratios and daylighting as an example.) I would
think the goal during the programming and schematic design phases should be
energy cost, not LEED points relative to the App. G baseline. Much of the
energy cost savings vs. App. G baseline (EAc1 points) is going to come later
from the mechanical and lighting designs. The suggestions in the paper to
establish specific baseline building shapes and glazing percentages would add
a LOT more modeling time ? you?d have to create two separate building
geometries for the baseline and proposed models, not to mention different
zoning patterns, space types, lighting power per space etc.

 

For mechanical design, once the size and programming of the project is
established, the baseline model properties are pretty well set, unless you
consider fuel-switching and go between baseline systems 1/3/5/7 to systems
2/4/6/8. One exception I can think of for a design decision that results in
higher energy cost but better comparison with the App. G baseline is higher
ventilation rates combined with heat recovery in the proposed and no heat
recovery in the baseline.

 

Regards,

Bill

Marcus, thank you incorporating this language.

 

The one scenario we often see in our design guidance work is that a proposed
design when compared with other design alternates does not necessarily
provided the largest energy savings when compared against its own baseline
case model. It is difficult to make a recommendation as consultants when we
want to present the Owner with both real energy cost savings without
compromising their LEED certification level targets.

listed below.

	 

	NC, CS, SCHOOLS, RETAIL, WAREHOUSE & DISTRIBUTION CENTERS,

	Establish an energy performance target no later than the schematic

source energy use. This target must be mapped on the same scale as the
baseline and proposed buildings, if the project follows Option 1.

	 

	OPTION 1. Whole Building Energy Simulation 

	Analyze a minimum of at least nine efficiency measures during the
design process and account for the results in design decision-making.
Analysis can include energy simulation of efficiency opportunities,
application of past energy simulation analyses for similar projects to the
project, or application of published data from energy analyses performed for
similar projects to the project (such as AEDGs).

	 

	A minimum of six energy efficiency measures focused on load reduction
strategies appropriate for the facility must be analyzed. This analysis must
be performed during the schematic design phase.

	 

	A minimum of three energy efficiency measures focused on HVAC related
strategies must be analyzed (passive measures are acceptable). This analysis
must be performed before the conclusion of the design development phase.

	 

	The results of the analysis must be summarized in a brief report or
memorandum.

	 

	 

	The next version of LEED will be going out for public comment again
in July, I think, so please comment formally as well as discussing here.

	OK, Carol..now you threw the "bait" out there..older than dirt, eh?

	 

	I have done very limited LEED "type" modeling where you compare 20
walls and 40 windows types (well, it seemed that way). Correct me if I am
wrong, but a Base model must be built to comply with a certain level of
ASHRAE 90.1 (now up to 2010 ??). With all of the nuisances of eQuest 3.64, I
am going to build the model from scrathc and put in all the relevant baseline
data in by hand.  And, by the way, the ASHRAE baseline model might be an
entirely different system.  I am just completing an EPACT evaluation (ASHRAE
90.1-2001) and the Baseline HVAC was screwe chillers, whereas the Actual
building was packaged units with Turbocor compressors (ask me how I did
that).

	 

	It very much depends on the complexity of the building. A 40,000 sf
office or a 500,000 sf hotel with casino facilites.

	 

	I am unfamiliar with the LEED paperwork to be filled out after the
modeling has been done. But I would not do anything of this type in under 120
hours, preferably 160 hours. If the client thinks he can do better, let him.

	Marcus,
	
	You have inadvertently hit upon why IBPSA worked with ASHRAE to
create a BEMP certification. That's Building Energy Modeling Professional
(BEMP). 
	
	Some of us who have been in the field for awhile began to worry a
couple of years ago when so many new energy modelers began appearing on the
listserv with questions. Their questions indicated a lack of training and
experience that was worrisome. What made it worrisome was that they didn't
seem to realize that they were as inexperienced as they were; they didn't
appear to be pursuing training to learn how to do what they were doing; and
we were uncertain as to how or if they were practicing quality control. We
hoped that by creating a path to certification that we would give clients one
more qualification to look for in their modelers.
	
	If you have been in this industry for any length of time, and by
industry I mean the overall construction industry, you know that you don't
get a lot of chances if your work doesn't pan out. If your energy model says
I have a LEED Gold building and I'm going to save $4,000/year and what I
really get is LEED Silver and $1,000/year, I am not going to be happy. So, I
will probably not give you any more work but, even worse for all of us, I'll
start expressing doubts about the whole process. LEED - what is it good for?
	
	So, now we all have more training, right? We read our ASHRAE
Handbooks and technical manuals so we know how to model the difficult stuff.
We can find any topic in the DOE2 Manuals, all of which are one line,
available, and easily searchable. 
	
	So now we are so good we can do these models in 40-80 hours. Really?
Not me and I've been doing it longer than everyone, except you, John Aulbach.
So I'm going to join Marcus in his rant because he's on to something.
	
	It's up to us to not under bid this work. It's up to us to educate
our clients about the importance of quality in this process. If they think
they are getting the same analysis in 40 hours that they used to get in 120
hours, they need to be led around to rethinking that and to be reminded that
GIGO.

160 or more hours to really do the design phase modeling right, you will go
up against the ?modeler? who claims to be able to do it in far less time.  So
how do we get the folks who issue the RFPs to ask for a proper scope of work
so that they can compare fees on a level playing field?  It is unfortunate
that we are even having a discussion about doing modeling work in opposition

Claire,
I had an interesting conversation with an IES rep about automated ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G baseline models.  He talked about the software developer thinking that they were 90% done about two years ago,  it was much more challenging than they thought it would be, but it's ready now.
Then I asked about the aspect that seems hardest to automate to me and his answer became let me get back to you.  It is not their fault.  ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G was never written to be automated the way that UK standards were, it is a moving target because of addenda, adopting authorities change things (LEED DES), and it is open to interpretations.  If you are making your business decisions based upon the Appendix G automation features, I suggest you look at the specific aspects that they can automate vs. what you need the most help with.

A true craftsperson never blames the tools and good management equips their staff well.

At the moment I'm thinking:

with complex geometries, but expensive (we already use IES but would

have to pay for the ASHRAE 90.1 navigator and related modules and

training, support)



-          EQUEST - less

automated and less suited to complex geometries

but cheaper and maybe designed more for ASHRAE modelling, less support

(but maybe more support from other users as software is widely used),

based on 'British' units (we are in UK so this means we generally have

to convert units)



-          Tas - slow and

clunky but gets there in the end, bit of a

non-runner in the long term for ASHRAE as you have to build all the

buildings manually, unless they actually release the long-promised

ASHRAE plug in

Hi Marcus,

Thanks for asking us for our feedback.  I welcome this opportunity to give
you some information regarding my experience as a LEED modeler and some
ideas I have for making the modeling part more useful.

Many of the LEED projects I work on do not use LEED as a design tool.  For
these projects, even though my initial proposal includes schematic design
and design development modeling, I am usually asked to complete only the
final LEED model and LEED model documentation, ie "please do only what is
required for LEED."  This means that the modeling tool is not being used to
make design decisions.

I like that the new EA C1 language talks about using energy modeling to
inform design decisions, and I think that it would be helpful to engage this
list-serve to determine the best way to bring that goal into the LEED
requirements.  One thing that comes to mind is that I use many tools during
design development phase energy modeling.  Often, I'll complete thermal
modeling of building envelope details in order to help the architect reach
achieve a higher overall R-value for envelope constructions.  While not a
whole-building energy analysis, this is often one of the most illuminating
discussions I have with architects.  Often I will run a simple model with
R-20, R-30 and R-40 walls, we'll look at overall energy use differences and
the engineer will look at benefits to system sizing and then the major
conversation is: how do we construct the building so that we actually
achieve an overall R-value that meets our goals, not just in the center of
the wall.

Sometimes I prepare a detailed report for model alternatives, the best
results come from sitting down with the design team, running a number of
alternatives and viewing and discussing results all at the same time.  The
LEED documentation requirement for this portion of the credit should be
similarly flexible.

Thanks for your time,

The NBI report and subsequent reanalysis is interesting but they and Marcus' emails beg the question:  What is LEED's energy efficiency metric?

LEED NC & CI reference 90.1 ECB and Appendix G which use energy costs.  LEED EBOM references Energy Star which uses source energy use intensity.  Other programs and experts use site energy use intensity or greenhouse gas emission intensity.   USGBC should pick its metric and craft all versions of LEED around it.  I understand it is a very nuanced and charged discussion involving modeling protocols, metering protocols, fuel switching, district energy systems, regionalism, current/future carbon content of electricity etc.  The more I look at Energy Star the more I respect their approach that source energy is the fairest and we just do not have enough data about some building types to say who the leaders of that type are.

Please don't show me more reports that we gave away plaques based on modeled dollar cost savings and then got worked up over metered site energy vs. non-calibrated modeled site energy.  There is a better way.  Lead us to it.

The primary purpose is to get the conversation started, early.  It is an opportunity to educate the owner and the team about energy.  In my experience the majority of designers can?t even tell you the metric for comparing building energy consumption.  I have often had this conversation early in the project design and have been met with blank stares.  It is incumbent upon us who do understand these energy issues to get the conversation started.
Caveat the heck out of the goal, explain the limitations, discuss the relative vs absolute metrics, be open about the issues ? so that we can raise awareness one conversation at a time.  This is the power of a market transformation tool like LEED.  It enables us to have these conversations.



I agree that both of these items are potential issues, talk to your clients about them.  If you don?t have a goal, how do you measure success?

While I conceptually agree with and understand the kbtu or watts/sf approach, to me, there seems to be some series issues with it in reality.

First, I don't agree that generating or coming up with appropriate target values during design is always (or even frequently) an easy thing to do or easy data to find.  It depends on your bldg type.  I do a lot of labs and hospitals.  Manufacturing and industrial use bldgs can have the same issues.
Good EUI data is not easy to come by for these bldg types - partly because the user equipment that is installed in them can be a big portion of the energy demand and consumption and it's always changing and can be very specific to each client.  For example: is it a community hosptial with more modest and generic care provide?....a state of the art hospital with specialized care functions?....does the lab have primarily biology or a chemistry functions....etc etc.  These things all affect the EUI.  In my opinion, the best resource for this data is actually utility companies based on data from similar customers, but that data is not generally publicly available and/or the population of similar comparable buildings may be small and difficult to relate to your bldg.

Second, quite frankly, in my opinion, DESIGN phase energy models are poor predictors of ACTUAL bldg energy use.  They are best at predicting RELATIVE
(comparative) energy use.  This is not because the tools are not good or inaccurate but because we and the owners are so poor at predicting how the bldg will actually be used, weather, etc.  One additional factor, is what equipment will actually be installed.  It's not uncommon for the technology to have changed bewteen the time that we start design and the time the equipment is actually purchased closer to the end of construction.  All these things effect not only the equipment w/sf usage but the ac w/sf usage etc.
So, there seems to me to be a serious disconnect to me if we talking about setting energy targets during DESIGNbased on statistical data of ACTUAL energy use and trying to use those figure during the design phase for predicted energy use.  Again, I love the idea but are we really there yet in reality.  It seems to me we need a lot more data that doesn't exist yet - and mechanism to collect that data.  (CBECS etc are good, but the population and variability for bldgs of these types has a long way to go).

I missing something about what's being proposed/talked about?

First of all the goal is not at all arbitrary but must be based on an expected outcome within a reasonable expectation.  It is informed by data from similar, actual building energy consumption.  I don?t think I need to explain the tools one can use to do this.



Your goal (do the best you can) sounds like, ?let?s build an energy efficient building?.  This is meaningless.  Energy efficiency in the context of new construction is always relative and without a quantification of what energy efficient means this is no goal at all.



Like any early stage performance goal the number is adjustable as more is discovered in the design process.  If the target is later discovered to be unreasonable due to a wide range of potential issues, then the target is adjusted.



If you pick your EUI goal the way you describe then yes this is a worthless goal but the key point is that it is never selected arbitrarily.

Not to be a jerk, but to ask an honest question: what is the point?  I?ve been involved with ?established energy target? projects and never really picked up on the logic behind it ? I would appreciate a layman?s explanation.



Put another way:  If you select an arbitrary EUI or watts per square foot at the earliest stages of design, what have you gained in design process?
If/when a project ?meets the goal? mid-design, are future design decisions supposed to de-emphasize energy impact (no!)?  If on the other hand, a project finds that target unreasonable down the road, what then?



Not setting a mile-marker like this implies designing the best building you can given the time/budget available and any other constraints? that seems more likely to result in the best end-result to me.



To draw analogy, if design of a LEED (or any energy-conscious) project is like planning a road trip from Kansas to Florida, setting EUI goals seems something like choosing a rest stop by throwing a dart at the map blindfolded.  It doesn?t help you get to your destination any more efficiently, it may be far out of the way, and now you?ve got a hole in the wall? what was the point?



Okay, maybe a weak analogy ? chalking it up to a very long week =).
Honestly, I?d appreciate someone laying the value behind this approach ? I?m expect the logic does exist, and I just haven?t yet seen the light!

Arpan,



Based on the Weidt Group paper, I?m guessing you?re emphasizing architectural considerations that affect the energy cost vs. LEED points numbers. (The paper uses window-to-wall ratios and daylighting as an example.) I would think the goal during the programming and schematic design phases should be energy cost, not LEED points relative to the App. G baseline. Much of the energy cost savings vs. App. G baseline (EAc1 points) is going to come later from the mechanical and lighting designs. The suggestions in the paper to establish specific baseline building shapes and glazing percentages would add a LOT more modeling time ? you?d have to create two separate building geometries for the baseline and proposed models, not to mention different zoning patterns, space types, lighting power per space etc.



For mechanical design, once the size and programming of the project is established, the baseline model properties are pretty well set, unless you consider fuel-switching and go between baseline systems 1/3/5/7 to systems 2/4/6/8. One exception I can think of for a design decision that results in higher energy cost but better comparison with the App. G baseline is higher ventilation rates combined with heat recovery in the proposed and no heat recovery in the baseline.



Regards,

Bill

Marcus, thank you incorporating this language.



The one scenario we often see in our design guidance work is that a proposed design when compared with other design alternates does not necessarily provided the largest energy savings when compared against its own baseline case model. It is difficult to make a recommendation as consultants when we want to present the Owner with both real energy cost savings without compromising their LEED certification level targets.

        If anyone has any good ideas about how to structure the LEED credits to end the practice of validation models at the end and encourage/require design phase modeling the folks on the USGBC EA TAG would love to hear them.
The current proposed credit language from the first public comment phase is listed below.



        NC, CS, SCHOOLS, RETAIL, WAREHOUSE & DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, HOSPITALITY

        Establish an energy performance target no later than the schematic design phase. The target must be established as kBTU per square foot-year of source energy use. This target must be mapped on the same scale as the baseline and proposed buildings, if the project follows Option 1.



        OPTION 1. Whole Building Energy Simulation

        Analyze a minimum of at least nine efficiency measures during the design process and account for the results in design decision-making.
Analysis can include energy simulation of efficiency opportunities, application of past energy simulation analyses for similar projects to the project, or application of published data from energy analyses performed for similar projects to the project (such as AEDGs).



        A minimum of six energy efficiency measures focused on load reduction strategies appropriate for the facility must be analyzed. This analysis must be performed during the schematic design phase.



        A minimum of three energy efficiency measures focused on HVAC related strategies must be analyzed (passive measures are acceptable). This analysis must be performed before the conclusion of the design development phase.



        The results of the analysis must be summarized in a brief report or memorandum.





        The next version of LEED will be going out for public comment again in July, I think, so please comment formally as well as discussing here.

        OK, Carol..now you threw the "bait" out there..older than dirt, eh?



        I have done very limited LEED "type" modeling where you compare 20 walls and 40 windows types (well, it seemed that way). Correct me if I am wrong, but a Base model must be built to comply with a certain level of ASHRAE 90.1 (now up to 2010 ??). With all of the nuisances of eQuest 3.64, I am going to build the model from scrathc and put in all the relevant baseline data in by hand.  And, by the way, the ASHRAE baseline model might be an entirely different system.  I am just completing an EPACT evaluation (ASHRAE
90.1-2001) and the Baseline HVAC was screwe chillers, whereas the Actual building was packaged units with Turbocor compressors (ask me how I did that).



        It very much depends on the complexity of the building. A 40,000 sf office or a 500,000 sf hotel with casino facilites.



        I am unfamiliar with the LEED paperwork to be filled out after the modeling has been done. But I would not do anything of this type in under 120 hours, preferably 160 hours. If the client thinks he can do better, let him.



        Contingency, contingency.



        We won't discuss how old CAROL might be..

        Marcus,

        You have inadvertently hit upon why IBPSA worked with ASHRAE to create a BEMP certification. That's Building Energy Modeling Professional (BEMP).

        Some of us who have been in the field for awhile began to worry a couple of years ago when so many new energy modelers began appearing on the listserv with questions. Their questions indicated a lack of training and experience that was worrisome. What made it worrisome was that they didn't seem to realize that they were as inexperienced as they were; they didn't appear to be pursuing training to learn how to do what they were doing; and we were uncertain as to how or if they were practicing quality control. We hoped that by creating a path to certification that we would give clients one more qualification to look for in their modelers.

        If you have been in this industry for any length of time, and by industry I mean the overall construction industry, you know that you don't get a lot of chances if your work doesn't pan out. If your energy model says I have a LEED Gold building and I'm going to save $4,000/year and what I really get is LEED Silver and $1,000/year, I am not going to be happy. So, I will probably not give you any more work but, even worse for all of us, I'll start expressing doubts about the whole process. LEED - what is it good for?

        So, now we all have more training, right? We read our ASHRAE Handbooks and technical manuals so we know how to model the difficult stuff.
We can find any topic in the DOE2 Manuals, all of which are one line, available, and easily searchable.

        So now we are so good we can do these models in 40-80 hours. Really?
Not me and I've been doing it longer than everyone, except you, John Aulbach.
So I'm going to join Marcus in his rant because he's on to something.

        It's up to us to not under bid this work. It's up to us to educate our clients about the importance of quality in this process. If they think they are getting the same analysis in 40 hours that they used to get in 120 hours, they need to be led around to rethinking that and to be reminded that GIGO.

        Cheers,

        Carol

                WARNING ? frustrated modeling rant to follow:



                Doing just a final model however completely misses the point as to why we model ? it is to guide design decisions!



                If I saw this RFP and all it asked me for was a model to determine LEED points, during or after design, I would try to educate the potential client about the purpose of modeling.



                Unfortunately too many projects pursuing LEED are only doing the minimum when it comes to modeling and almost completely missing all the benefits.  Too often the ?market? transforms only based on a least first cost denominator basis that results in little real transformation.  Doing models to determine LEED points does not transform the market, save any energy, and just circumvents the purpose behind LEED. (the next version actually requires design phase modeling!)



                Any ?modeler? who does only final models without attempting to explain to the owner why this is a bad idea should be ?drummed out of the corp? in my humble opinion.



                The problem is that if you respond to this RFP with 120 or
160 or more hours to really do the design phase modeling right, you will go up against the ?modeler? who claims to be able to do it in far less time.  So how do we get the folks who issue the RFPs to ask for a proper scope of work so that they can compare fees on a level playing field?  It is unfortunate that we are even having a discussion about doing modeling work in opposition to its purpose.



                Sorry for the rant but I feel better now. J

                I have a question regarding the cost of an energy model for a LEED project. Every energy model I've done so far has been for

                existing buildings, mainly for optimization purposes.
However, I received an RFP to model a five-story, 41,500 sq. ft. building

                that's currently on the design phase and is pursuing the LEED-NC Silver certification. I really have no idea what would be a fair

                price for this model since I'm going to have to use Appendix G (ASHRAE 90.1) to evaluate the difference between the base

                and proposed buildings. I don't know how much extra effort this will take. I know the procedure, just haven't done it before.



                Can you shed any light on this issue?



                Thanks in advance!

All:

I've been intrigued ever since I saw RMI's presentation on how target EUI's were set for the showcase Empire State Building renovation - where an innovative approach was used to define the building's "technical potential to achieve" and then measuring success by the team's ability to deliver a cost effective project than meets the "technical potential to achieve" as much as possible, while balancing all other needs.  Here's a nice summary - http://www.retrofitdepot.org/Content/Files/ESBCaseStudy.pdf	

I've been thinking that, in general, re-framing energy performance success (i.e. EA C1 points) not as a "% better than an Appendix G Baseline" but to "% below the building's semi-unique technical potential to achieve" - might have interesting and positive effects.  By that I mean, imagine an office building designed and predicted to consume (on a site EUI basis) an EUI of 89 kBtu/ft2, while the technical potential to achieve might have been determined to be 70 kBtu/ft2.   This represents a (1-(89/70)) = 27% gap, which say falls between 25% and 30% and it worth 3 EA C1 pts. 

The ASHRAE Standard 100 Revision Committee has been working with some unique "hybrid" approaches combining "prototype or reference building energy models" and CBECS data to generate regional EUI targets based on building composition, building size, and building operating hours. The proposed revision of ASHRAE Standard 100 (not yet out for public comment) will incorporate a procedure for generating a building specific EUI for setting retrofit performance targets.  Here's a link to a presentation by Terry Sharp where he describes the basic concept under "Option 3" -  http://tc76.org/docs/programs/ASRHAE%20std%20100%20%20Sem%2020102520June_Sharp.ppt Remember that EPA Target Finder is based exclusively on the EPA Portfolio Manager models, which are based on a number of different years of CBECS surveys, dependent on the space type. 

It's not too much of a stretch to imagine, following the general principles from above and the methods described in proposed revision to Standard 100, to be able to generate a unique 'semi-custom' EUI for your building project - maybe it might look something like this:

1) Download appropriate DOE prototype model(s)
2) Add appropriate exterior shading (adjacent buildings, etc.) 
3) Replace building fabric elements with appropriate benchmark elements for your building type (retrofit / new construction) 
4) Replace 'asset' related elements (lights, equipment) with appropriate benchmark elements for your building type  (retrofit / new construction)
4) Generate site EUI results with a weather file for your location.
5) If necessary, combine (area weight) EUI to result in whole building "Potential to Achieve"

In this way, one ends up with a semi-custom EUI performance target to measure success against - a target could be "better defined" than what you can currently get from EAP Target Finder.   I can envision a consensus document which lays out a specifications and procedure for allowable alteration of the DOE models, in order to generate the "Potential to Achieve EUI", after which the % difference from an "As Designed" case translate to EA C1 points.  I know this is NOT the original purpose of the DOE Benchmark Buildings, but with careful thought, and community consensus, I think a process of something like this may move the centroid of the community in the right direction. The energy usage 'goal' would be known as soon as the program was set, and the design team can react from there.  Also, the resulting "As Designed" model could be more useful, at would be meant to represent actual building performance to the best of the knowledge of the design team.  

Thoughts?

All the Best,

The primary purpose is to get the conversation started, early.  It is an opportunity to educate the owner and the team about energy.  In my experience the majority of designers can?t even tell you the metric for comparing building energy consumption.  I have often had this conversation early in the project design and have been met with blank stares.  It is incumbent upon us who do understand these energy issues to get the conversation started.
Caveat the heck out of the goal, explain the limitations, discuss the relative vs absolute metrics, be open about the issues ? so that we can raise awareness one conversation at a time.  This is the power of a market transformation tool like LEED.  It enables us to have these conversations.

 

I agree that both of these items are potential issues, talk to your clients about them.  If you don?t have a goal, how do you measure success?

While I conceptually agree with and understand the kbtu or watts/sf approach, to me, there seems to be some series issues with it in reality.

First, I don't agree that generating or coming up with appropriate target values during design is always (or even frequently) an easy thing to do or easy data to find.  It depends on your bldg type.  I do a lot of labs and hospitals.  Manufacturing and industrial use bldgs can have the same issues.
Good EUI data is not easy to come by for these bldg types - partly because the user equipment that is installed in them can be a big portion of the energy demand and consumption and it's always changing and can be very specific to each client.  For example: is it a community hosptial with more modest and generic care provide?....a state of the art hospital with specialized care functions?....does the lab have primarily biology or a chemistry functions....etc etc.  These things all affect the EUI.  In my opinion, the best resource for this data is actually utility companies based on data from similar customers, but that data is not generally publicly available and/or the population of similar comparable buildings may be small and difficult to relate to your bldg.  

Second, quite frankly, in my opinion, DESIGN phase energy models are poor predictors of ACTUAL bldg energy use.  They are best at predicting RELATIVE
(comparative) energy use.  This is not because the tools are not good or inaccurate but because we and the owners are so poor at predicting how the bldg will actually be used, weather, etc.  One additional factor, is what equipment will actually be installed.  It's not uncommon for the technology to have changed bewteen the time that we start design and the time the equipment is actually purchased closer to the end of construction.  All these things effect not only the equipment w/sf usage but the ac w/sf usage etc.
So, there seems to me to be a serious disconnect to me if we talking about setting energy targets during DESIGNbased on statistical data of ACTUAL energy use and trying to use those figure during the design phase for predicted energy use.  Again, I love the idea but are we really there yet in reality.  It seems to me we need a lot more data that doesn't exist yet - and mechanism to collect that data.  (CBECS etc are good, but the population and variability for bldgs of these types has a long way to go).

I missing something about what's being proposed/talked about?

First of all the goal is not at all arbitrary but must be based on an expected outcome within a reasonable expectation.  It is informed by data from similar, actual building energy consumption.  I don?t think I need to explain the tools one can use to do this.

 

Your goal (do the best you can) sounds like, ?let?s build an energy efficient building?.  This is meaningless.  Energy efficiency in the context of new construction is always relative and without a quantification of what energy efficient means this is no goal at all.

 

Like any early stage performance goal the number is adjustable as more is discovered in the design process.  If the target is later discovered to be unreasonable due to a wide range of potential issues, then the target is adjusted.

 

If you pick your EUI goal the way you describe then yes this is a worthless goal but the key point is that it is never selected arbitrarily.

Not to be a jerk, but to ask an honest question: what is the point?  I?ve been involved with ?established energy target? projects and never really picked up on the logic behind it ? I would appreciate a layman?s explanation.

 

Put another way:  If you select an arbitrary EUI or watts per square foot at the earliest stages of design, what have you gained in design process?
If/when a project ?meets the goal? mid-design, are future design decisions supposed to de-emphasize energy impact (no!)?  If on the other hand, a project finds that target unreasonable down the road, what then?  

 

Not setting a mile-marker like this implies designing the best building you can given the time/budget available and any other constraints? that seems more likely to result in the best end-result to me.

 

To draw analogy, if design of a LEED (or any energy-conscious) project is like planning a road trip from Kansas to Florida, setting EUI goals seems something like choosing a rest stop by throwing a dart at the map blindfolded.  It doesn?t help you get to your destination any more efficiently, it may be far out of the way, and now you?ve got a hole in the wall? what was the point?

 

Okay, maybe a weak analogy ? chalking it up to a very long week =).
Honestly, I?d appreciate someone laying the value behind this approach ? I?m expect the logic does exist, and I just haven?t yet seen the light!

Agreed.  The new credit language for the next version of LEED does ask project teams to establish an absolute performance goal.

Could any one advice why LEED would not put the base design as Watt per square foot, or per occupant, or per hotel bed etc. so the Architecture becomes more innovative early in the design to save energy?

Arpan,

 

Based on the Weidt Group paper, I?m guessing you?re emphasizing architectural considerations that affect the energy cost vs. LEED points numbers. (The paper uses window-to-wall ratios and daylighting as an example.) I would think the goal during the programming and schematic design phases should be energy cost, not LEED points relative to the App. G baseline. Much of the energy cost savings vs. App. G baseline (EAc1 points) is going to come later from the mechanical and lighting designs. The suggestions in the paper to establish specific baseline building shapes and glazing percentages would add a LOT more modeling time ? you?d have to create two separate building geometries for the baseline and proposed models, not to mention different zoning patterns, space types, lighting power per space etc.

 

For mechanical design, once the size and programming of the project is established, the baseline model properties are pretty well set, unless you consider fuel-switching and go between baseline systems 1/3/5/7 to systems 2/4/6/8. One exception I can think of for a design decision that results in higher energy cost but better comparison with the App. G baseline is higher ventilation rates combined with heat recovery in the proposed and no heat recovery in the baseline.

 

Regards,

Bill

Marcus, thank you incorporating this language.

 

The one scenario we often see in our design guidance work is that a proposed design when compared with other design alternates does not necessarily provided the largest energy savings when compared against its own baseline case model. It is difficult to make a recommendation as consultants when we want to present the Owner with both real energy cost savings without compromising their LEED certification level targets.

	If anyone has any good ideas about how to structure the LEED credits to end the practice of validation models at the end and encourage/require design phase modeling the folks on the USGBC EA TAG would love to hear them.
The current proposed credit language from the first public comment phase is listed below.

	 

	NC, CS, SCHOOLS, RETAIL, WAREHOUSE & DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, HOSPITALITY

	Establish an energy performance target no later than the schematic design phase. The target must be established as kBTU per square foot-year of source energy use. This target must be mapped on the same scale as the baseline and proposed buildings, if the project follows Option 1.

	 

	OPTION 1. Whole Building Energy Simulation 

	Analyze a minimum of at least nine efficiency measures during the design process and account for the results in design decision-making.
Analysis can include energy simulation of efficiency opportunities, application of past energy simulation analyses for similar projects to the project, or application of published data from energy analyses performed for similar projects to the project (such as AEDGs).

	 

	A minimum of six energy efficiency measures focused on load reduction strategies appropriate for the facility must be analyzed. This analysis must be performed during the schematic design phase.

	 

	A minimum of three energy efficiency measures focused on HVAC related strategies must be analyzed (passive measures are acceptable). This analysis must be performed before the conclusion of the design development phase.

	 

	The results of the analysis must be summarized in a brief report or memorandum.

	 

	 

	The next version of LEED will be going out for public comment again in July, I think, so please comment formally as well as discussing here.

	OK, Carol..now you threw the "bait" out there..older than dirt, eh?

	 

	I have done very limited LEED "type" modeling where you compare 20 walls and 40 windows types (well, it seemed that way). Correct me if I am wrong, but a Base model must be built to comply with a certain level of ASHRAE 90.1 (now up to 2010 ??). With all of the nuisances of eQuest 3.64, I am going to build the model from scrathc and put in all the relevant baseline data in by hand.  And, by the way, the ASHRAE baseline model might be an entirely different system.  I am just completing an EPACT evaluation (ASHRAE
90.1-2001) and the Baseline HVAC was screwe chillers, whereas the Actual building was packaged units with Turbocor compressors (ask me how I did that).

	 

	It very much depends on the complexity of the building. A 40,000 sf office or a 500,000 sf hotel with casino facilites.

	 

	I am unfamiliar with the LEED paperwork to be filled out after the modeling has been done. But I would not do anything of this type in under 120 hours, preferably 160 hours. If the client thinks he can do better, let him.

	 

	Contingency, contingency.

	 

	We won't discuss how old CAROL might be..

	Marcus,
	
	You have inadvertently hit upon why IBPSA worked with ASHRAE to create a BEMP certification. That's Building Energy Modeling Professional (BEMP). 
	
	Some of us who have been in the field for awhile began to worry a couple of years ago when so many new energy modelers began appearing on the listserv with questions. Their questions indicated a lack of training and experience that was worrisome. What made it worrisome was that they didn't seem to realize that they were as inexperienced as they were; they didn't appear to be pursuing training to learn how to do what they were doing; and we were uncertain as to how or if they were practicing quality control. We hoped that by creating a path to certification that we would give clients one more qualification to look for in their modelers.
	
	If you have been in this industry for any length of time, and by industry I mean the overall construction industry, you know that you don't get a lot of chances if your work doesn't pan out. If your energy model says I have a LEED Gold building and I'm going to save $4,000/year and what I really get is LEED Silver and $1,000/year, I am not going to be happy. So, I will probably not give you any more work but, even worse for all of us, I'll start expressing doubts about the whole process. LEED - what is it good for?
	
	So, now we all have more training, right? We read our ASHRAE Handbooks and technical manuals so we know how to model the difficult stuff.
We can find any topic in the DOE2 Manuals, all of which are one line, available, and easily searchable. 
	
	So now we are so good we can do these models in 40-80 hours. Really?
Not me and I've been doing it longer than everyone, except you, John Aulbach.
So I'm going to join Marcus in his rant because he's on to something.
	
	It's up to us to not under bid this work. It's up to us to educate our clients about the importance of quality in this process. If they think they are getting the same analysis in 40 hours that they used to get in 120 hours, they need to be led around to rethinking that and to be reminded that GIGO.

Doing models to determine LEED points does not transform the market, save any energy, and just circumvents the purpose behind LEED. (the next version actually requires design phase modeling!)

		The problem is that if you respond to this RFP with 120 or
160 or more hours to really do the design phase modeling right, you will go up against the ?modeler? who claims to be able to do it in far less time.  So how do we get the folks who issue the RFPs to ask for a proper scope of work so that they can compare fees on a level playing field?  It is unfortunate that we are even having a discussion about doing modeling work in opposition to its purpose.

		I would expect, for a building this size, approximately 40 hours (multiply by your hourly rate). The 40 hours include EAp2/EAc1 LEED documentation, and any review you may have to respond to later.

		 

		Now, given that you have never done a LEED model, it will take you more time, possibly up to 40 more hours.

However, I received an RFP to model a five-story, 41,500 sq. ft. building

Paul,

The next version of LEED will approach a more standardized metric (EUI Source Energy) but still include cost as a metric as well.  For those who feel strongly that only actual energy use should be used for green building certification the LEED EBOM methodologies will be allowed into LEED BD+C projects.

USGBC is trying hard to lead us to that better way.  If you know the better way please share.

The NBI report and subsequent reanalysis is interesting but they and Marcus' emails beg the question:  What is LEED's energy efficiency metric?

LEED NC & CI reference 90.1 ECB and Appendix G which use energy costs.  LEED EBOM references Energy Star which uses source energy use intensity.  Other programs and experts use site energy use intensity or greenhouse gas emission intensity.   USGBC should pick its metric and craft all versions of LEED around it.  I understand it is a very nuanced and charged discussion involving modeling protocols, metering protocols, fuel switching, district energy systems, regionalism, current/future carbon content of electricity etc.  The more I look at Energy Star the more I respect their approach that source energy is the fairest and we just do not have enough data about some building types to say who the leaders of that type are.

Please don't show me more reports that we gave away plaques based on modeled dollar cost savings and then got worked up over metered site energy vs. non-calibrated modeled site energy.  There is a better way.  Lead us to it.

The primary purpose is to get the conversation started, early.  It is an opportunity to educate the owner and the team about energy.  In my experience the majority of designers can?t even tell you the metric for comparing building energy consumption.  I have often had this conversation early in the project design and have been met with blank stares.  It is incumbent upon us who do understand these energy issues to get the conversation started.
Caveat the heck out of the goal, explain the limitations, discuss the relative vs absolute metrics, be open about the issues ? so that we can raise awareness one conversation at a time.  This is the power of a market transformation tool like LEED.  It enables us to have these conversations.



I agree that both of these items are potential issues, talk to your clients about them.  If you don?t have a goal, how do you measure success?

While I conceptually agree with and understand the kbtu or watts/sf approach, to me, there seems to be some series issues with it in reality.

First, I don't agree that generating or coming up with appropriate target values during design is always (or even frequently) an easy thing to do or easy data to find.  It depends on your bldg type.  I do a lot of labs and hospitals.  Manufacturing and industrial use bldgs can have the same issues.
Good EUI data is not easy to come by for these bldg types - partly because the user equipment that is installed in them can be a big portion of the energy demand and consumption and it's always changing and can be very specific to each client.  For example: is it a community hosptial with more modest and generic care provide?....a state of the art hospital with specialized care functions?....does the lab have primarily biology or a chemistry functions....etc etc.  These things all affect the EUI.  In my opinion, the best resource for this data is actually utility companies based on data from similar customers, but that data is not generally publicly available and/or the population of similar comparable buildings may be small and difficult to relate to your bldg.

Second, quite frankly, in my opinion, DESIGN phase energy models are poor predictors of ACTUAL bldg energy use.  They are best at predicting RELATIVE
(comparative) energy use.  This is not because the tools are not good or inaccurate but because we and the owners are so poor at predicting how the bldg will actually be used, weather, etc.  One additional factor, is what equipment will actually be installed.  It's not uncommon for the technology to have changed bewteen the time that we start design and the time the equipment is actually purchased closer to the end of construction.  All these things effect not only the equipment w/sf usage but the ac w/sf usage etc.
So, there seems to me to be a serious disconnect to me if we talking about setting energy targets during DESIGNbased on statistical data of ACTUAL energy use and trying to use those figure during the design phase for predicted energy use.  Again, I love the idea but are we really there yet in reality.  It seems to me we need a lot more data that doesn't exist yet - and mechanism to collect that data.  (CBECS etc are good, but the population and variability for bldgs of these types has a long way to go).

I missing something about what's being proposed/talked about?

First of all the goal is not at all arbitrary but must be based on an expected outcome within a reasonable expectation.  It is informed by data from similar, actual building energy consumption.  I don?t think I need to explain the tools one can use to do this.



Your goal (do the best you can) sounds like, ?let?s build an energy efficient building?.  This is meaningless.  Energy efficiency in the context of new construction is always relative and without a quantification of what energy efficient means this is no goal at all.



Like any early stage performance goal the number is adjustable as more is discovered in the design process.  If the target is later discovered to be unreasonable due to a wide range of potential issues, then the target is adjusted.



If you pick your EUI goal the way you describe then yes this is a worthless goal but the key point is that it is never selected arbitrarily.

Not to be a jerk, but to ask an honest question: what is the point?  I?ve been involved with ?established energy target? projects and never really picked up on the logic behind it ? I would appreciate a layman?s explanation.



Put another way:  If you select an arbitrary EUI or watts per square foot at the earliest stages of design, what have you gained in design process?
If/when a project ?meets the goal? mid-design, are future design decisions supposed to de-emphasize energy impact (no!)?  If on the other hand, a project finds that target unreasonable down the road, what then?



Not setting a mile-marker like this implies designing the best building you can given the time/budget available and any other constraints? that seems more likely to result in the best end-result to me.



To draw analogy, if design of a LEED (or any energy-conscious) project is like planning a road trip from Kansas to Florida, setting EUI goals seems something like choosing a rest stop by throwing a dart at the map blindfolded.  It doesn?t help you get to your destination any more efficiently, it may be far out of the way, and now you?ve got a hole in the wall? what was the point?



Okay, maybe a weak analogy ? chalking it up to a very long week =).
Honestly, I?d appreciate someone laying the value behind this approach ? I?m expect the logic does exist, and I just haven?t yet seen the light!

Arpan,



Based on the Weidt Group paper, I?m guessing you?re emphasizing architectural considerations that affect the energy cost vs. LEED points numbers. (The paper uses window-to-wall ratios and daylighting as an example.) I would think the goal during the programming and schematic design phases should be energy cost, not LEED points relative to the App. G baseline. Much of the energy cost savings vs. App. G baseline (EAc1 points) is going to come later from the mechanical and lighting designs. The suggestions in the paper to establish specific baseline building shapes and glazing percentages would add a LOT more modeling time ? you?d have to create two separate building geometries for the baseline and proposed models, not to mention different zoning patterns, space types, lighting power per space etc.



For mechanical design, once the size and programming of the project is established, the baseline model properties are pretty well set, unless you consider fuel-switching and go between baseline systems 1/3/5/7 to systems 2/4/6/8. One exception I can think of for a design decision that results in higher energy cost but better comparison with the App. G baseline is higher ventilation rates combined with heat recovery in the proposed and no heat recovery in the baseline.



Regards,

Bill

Marcus, thank you incorporating this language.



The one scenario we often see in our design guidance work is that a proposed design when compared with other design alternates does not necessarily provided the largest energy savings when compared against its own baseline case model. It is difficult to make a recommendation as consultants when we want to present the Owner with both real energy cost savings without compromising their LEED certification level targets.

        If anyone has any good ideas about how to structure the LEED credits to end the practice of validation models at the end and encourage/require design phase modeling the folks on the USGBC EA TAG would love to hear them.
The current proposed credit language from the first public comment phase is listed below.



        NC, CS, SCHOOLS, RETAIL, WAREHOUSE & DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, HOSPITALITY

        Establish an energy performance target no later than the schematic design phase. The target must be established as kBTU per square foot-year of source energy use. This target must be mapped on the same scale as the baseline and proposed buildings, if the project follows Option 1.



        OPTION 1. Whole Building Energy Simulation

        Analyze a minimum of at least nine efficiency measures during the design process and account for the results in design decision-making.
Analysis can include energy simulation of efficiency opportunities, application of past energy simulation analyses for similar projects to the project, or application of published data from energy analyses performed for similar projects to the project (such as AEDGs).



        A minimum of six energy efficiency measures focused on load reduction strategies appropriate for the facility must be analyzed. This analysis must be performed during the schematic design phase.



        A minimum of three energy efficiency measures focused on HVAC related strategies must be analyzed (passive measures are acceptable). This analysis must be performed before the conclusion of the design development phase.



        The results of the analysis must be summarized in a brief report or memorandum.





        The next version of LEED will be going out for public comment again in July, I think, so please comment formally as well as discussing here.

        OK, Carol..now you threw the "bait" out there..older than dirt, eh?



        I have done very limited LEED "type" modeling where you compare 20 walls and 40 windows types (well, it seemed that way). Correct me if I am wrong, but a Base model must be built to comply with a certain level of ASHRAE 90.1 (now up to 2010 ??). With all of the nuisances of eQuest 3.64, I am going to build the model from scrathc and put in all the relevant baseline data in by hand.  And, by the way, the ASHRAE baseline model might be an entirely different system.  I am just completing an EPACT evaluation (ASHRAE
90.1-2001) and the Baseline HVAC was screwe chillers, whereas the Actual building was packaged units with Turbocor compressors (ask me how I did that).



        It very much depends on the complexity of the building. A 40,000 sf office or a 500,000 sf hotel with casino facilites.



        I am unfamiliar with the LEED paperwork to be filled out after the modeling has been done. But I would not do anything of this type in under 120 hours, preferably 160 hours. If the client thinks he can do better, let him.



        Contingency, contingency.



        We won't discuss how old CAROL might be..

        Marcus,

        You have inadvertently hit upon why IBPSA worked with ASHRAE to create a BEMP certification. That's Building Energy Modeling Professional (BEMP).

        Some of us who have been in the field for awhile began to worry a couple of years ago when so many new energy modelers began appearing on the listserv with questions. Their questions indicated a lack of training and experience that was worrisome. What made it worrisome was that they didn't seem to realize that they were as inexperienced as they were; they didn't appear to be pursuing training to learn how to do what they were doing; and we were uncertain as to how or if they were practicing quality control. We hoped that by creating a path to certification that we would give clients one more qualification to look for in their modelers.

        If you have been in this industry for any length of time, and by industry I mean the overall construction industry, you know that you don't get a lot of chances if your work doesn't pan out. If your energy model says I have a LEED Gold building and I'm going to save $4,000/year and what I really get is LEED Silver and $1,000/year, I am not going to be happy. So, I will probably not give you any more work but, even worse for all of us, I'll start expressing doubts about the whole process. LEED - what is it good for?

        So, now we all have more training, right? We read our ASHRAE Handbooks and technical manuals so we know how to model the difficult stuff.
We can find any topic in the DOE2 Manuals, all of which are one line, available, and easily searchable.

        So now we are so good we can do these models in 40-80 hours. Really?
Not me and I've been doing it longer than everyone, except you, John Aulbach.
So I'm going to join Marcus in his rant because he's on to something.

        It's up to us to not under bid this work. It's up to us to educate our clients about the importance of quality in this process. If they think they are getting the same analysis in 40 hours that they used to get in 120 hours, they need to be led around to rethinking that and to be reminded that GIGO.

        Cheers,

        Carol

                WARNING ? frustrated modeling rant to follow:



                Doing just a final model however completely misses the point as to why we model ? it is to guide design decisions!



                If I saw this RFP and all it asked me for was a model to determine LEED points, during or after design, I would try to educate the potential client about the purpose of modeling.



                Unfortunately too many projects pursuing LEED are only doing the minimum when it comes to modeling and almost completely missing all the benefits.  Too often the ?market? transforms only based on a least first cost denominator basis that results in little real transformation.  Doing models to determine LEED points does not transform the market, save any energy, and just circumvents the purpose behind LEED. (the next version actually requires design phase modeling!)



                Any ?modeler? who does only final models without attempting to explain to the owner why this is a bad idea should be ?drummed out of the corp? in my humble opinion.



                The problem is that if you respond to this RFP with 120 or
160 or more hours to really do the design phase modeling right, you will go up against the ?modeler? who claims to be able to do it in far less time.  So how do we get the folks who issue the RFPs to ask for a proper scope of work so that they can compare fees on a level playing field?  It is unfortunate that we are even having a discussion about doing modeling work in opposition to its purpose.



                Sorry for the rant but I feel better now. J

                I would expect, for a building this size, approximately 40 hours (multiply by your hourly rate). The 40 hours include EAp2/EAc1 LEED documentation, and any review you may have to respond to later.



                Now, given that you have never done a LEED model, it will take you more time, possibly up to 40 more hours.

                Greetings everyone,



                I have a question regarding the cost of an energy model for a LEED project. Every energy model I've done so far has been for

                existing buildings, mainly for optimization purposes.
However, I received an RFP to model a five-story, 41,500 sq. ft. building

                that's currently on the design phase and is pursuing the LEED-NC Silver certification. I really have no idea what would be a fair

                price for this model since I'm going to have to use Appendix G (ASHRAE 90.1) to evaluate the difference between the base

                and proposed buildings. I don't know how much extra effort this will take. I know the procedure, just haven't done it before.



                Can you shed any light on this issue?



                Thanks in advance!

One variation I was considering to EUI was to look at Kbtu per annual occupant hour vs. Kbtu per area. This came about when I wanted know how to evaluate some operational alternatives such as extending the hours of operation for a facility, or looking at an office running with a rotating staff all working 4x10 hour days a week vs. a smaller static staff in the same building working 5x8 hour days a week. Kbtu/sf2 alone didn't help here, but looking at Kbtu per annual occupant hour did.

Extending operational hours will clearly increase your Kbtu/ft2 (EUI) but the question I wanted to answer is if those extra occupant hours come at a lower energy impact per occupant hour than the baseline case. "Kbtu/ annual occupant hour" addressed this. Is there a similar metric that anyone else is using?

Marcus, Jeremy, David and others:

 

Thanks so much!  Your responses helped fill in a gap ? in my experience, establishing early EUI targets has indeed felt ?arbitrary,? and it?s precisely because of the litany of issues brought up regarding what really makes for an appropriate comparison.  

 

The exercise of determining an appropriate EUI target has proven deceptively challenging, in my experience.  The energy star target finder will generate a number to run with minimal effort, which is great, but when that target is scrutinized by skeptical minds, it can be hard to justify/defend how ?realistic? that target is for a given project, considering all the unknowns behind the figure.  These include attributes like age of construction (for renovation projects), unique building geometries, scheduling and more.  David?s response summed up some of the unknowns well, imho.

 

Suffice to say, some of us in the energy modeling trenches could use some assistance/reassurance in methods of establishing well-grounded EUI targets?  In constructing ?Implementation? language for the ?preliminary modeling? credit under discussion, I would personally like to see some specific guidance/examples to this end, or else a reference to a standard illustrating the same.  I feel somewhat disillusioned regarding EUI targets and their resulting effects on the design process, but it?s apparent others have had some pretty positive experiences, so I?d like to learn more!

 

~Nick

 

PS: I know written words don?t always read the way they were intended, but my query/analogy regarding EUI targets is not intended to criticize or judge others? practices!  I only mean to illustrate what I?ve been struggling with, if only to share experiences and learn from the discussion!

Subject: RE: [Bldg-sim] Energy Model Cost - best designdoesn'tequalmost LEED points

 

I guess this is where I enter this interesting discussion.  The selection of an EUI should definitely not be arbitrary.  In fact, the LEED-EB rating system already provides a good example of how to choose an appropriate target EUI: Energy Star.  Target Finder can be used for this, or you can build your own spreadsheet from the technical descriptions at http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=evaluate_performance.bus_portfoliomanager_model_tech_desc.  Most of the variables you need to set the target EUI are schematic level: anticipated hours of operation, gross floor area, number of occupants, HDD/CDD.

 

At the same time, looking at the AIA design milestones, I would be concerned if a project experiences changes that have a significant impact on energy consumption after 75% CD, maybe even 50% CD depending on the project.  I could see a late decision to use MERV 13 filters causing an increase in fan energy, but that decision can also be mitigated through other variables such as filter surface area.

 

There needs to be some change to the process to prioritize the right decisions first.  Energy needs to be part of the decision model for a building at the early phases of the project, part of site selection for projects that are defined that way or part of the pro forma for developments that start with a fixed site.  In many cases, it is part of those, but with no connection to the remainder of the decision model.

 

On your analogy, Nick, I?d suggest that using a goal of designing the best building possible within time/budget constraints is more akin to just getting in a car and driving.  Who?s to judge if you actually arrive at your destination?  You might be able to say you had a good trip and the drive was a success, but would it have been more successful if you knew where you were going and how to get there most efficiently?  However, starting with a destination in mind allows you to better plan your trip from a time/budget perspective.  Just having an EUI goal doesn?t mean that you ignore the energy impact of decisions.  It just means that you have another criteria to let you know if you?re making the right decision.  The flip side is also true: if a decision is made late in the design that negatively affects EUI, you can catch it.  The EUI goal is more like having a GPS on your driving trip, letting you know if you make a wrong turn along the way.

First of all the goal is not at all arbitrary but must be based on an expected outcome within a reasonable expectation.  It is informed by data from similar, actual building energy consumption.  I don?t think I need to explain the tools one can use to do this.

 

Your goal (do the best you can) sounds like, ?let?s build an energy efficient building?.  This is meaningless.  Energy efficiency in the context of new construction is always relative and without a quantification of what energy efficient means this is no goal at all.

 

Like any early stage performance goal the number is adjustable as more is discovered in the design process.  If the target is later discovered to be unreasonable due to a wide range of potential issues, then the target is adjusted.

 

If you pick your EUI goal the way you describe then yes this is a worthless goal but the key point is that it is never selected arbitrarily.

Not to be a jerk, but to ask an honest question: what is the point?  I?ve been involved with ?established energy target? projects and never really picked up on the logic behind it ? I would appreciate a layman?s explanation.

 

Put another way:  If you select an arbitrary EUI or watts per square foot at the earliest stages of design, what have you gained in design process?  If/when a project ?meets the goal? mid-design, are future design decisions supposed to de-emphasize energy impact (no!)?  If on the other hand, a project finds that target unreasonable down the road, what then?  

 

Not setting a mile-marker like this implies designing the best building you can given the time/budget available and any other constraints? that seems more likely to result in the best end-result to me.

 

To draw analogy, if design of a LEED (or any energy-conscious) project is like planning a road trip from Kansas to Florida, setting EUI goals seems something like choosing a rest stop by throwing a dart at the map blindfolded.  It doesn?t help you get to your destination any more efficiently, it may be far out of the way, and now you?ve got a hole in the wall? what was the point?

 

Okay, maybe a weak analogy ? chalking it up to a very long week =).  Honestly, I?d appreciate someone laying the value behind this approach ? I?m expect the logic does exist, and I just haven?t yet seen the light!

Agreed.  The new credit language for the next version of LEED does ask project teams to establish an absolute performance goal.

Could any one advice why LEED would not put the base design as Watt per square foot, or per occupant, or per hotel bed etc. so the Architecture becomes more innovative early in the design to save energy?

Arpan,

 

Based on the Weidt Group paper, I?m guessing you?re emphasizing architectural considerations that affect the energy cost vs. LEED points numbers. (The paper uses window-to-wall ratios and daylighting as an example.) I would think the goal during the programming and schematic design phases should be energy cost, not LEED points relative to the App. G baseline. Much of the energy cost savings vs. App. G baseline (EAc1 points) is going to come later from the mechanical and lighting designs. The suggestions in the paper to establish specific baseline building shapes and glazing percentages would add a LOT more modeling time ? you?d have to create two separate building geometries for the baseline and proposed models, not to mention different zoning patterns, space types, lighting power per space etc.

 

For mechanical design, once the size and programming of the project is established, the baseline model properties are pretty well set, unless you consider fuel-switching and go between baseline systems 1/3/5/7 to systems 2/4/6/8. One exception I can think of for a design decision that results in higher energy cost but better comparison with the App. G baseline is higher ventilation rates combined with heat recovery in the proposed and no heat recovery in the baseline.

 

Regards,

Bill

Marcus, thank you incorporating this language.

 

The one scenario we often see in our design guidance work is that a proposed design when compared with other design alternates does not necessarily provided the largest energy savings when compared against its own baseline case model. It is difficult to make a recommendation as consultants when we want to present the Owner with both real energy cost savings without compromising their LEED certification level targets.  

A recent paper presented by the Weidt Group at SimBuild touched on this issue:

	A minimum of six energy efficiency measures focused on load reduction strategies appropriate for the facility must be analyzed. This analysis must be performed during the schematic design phase.

	OK, Carol..now you threw the "bait" out there..older than dirt, eh?

	 

	I have done very limited LEED "type" modeling where you compare 20 walls and 40 windows types (well, it seemed that way). Correct me if I am wrong, but a Base model must be built to comply with a certain level of ASHRAE 90.1 (now up to 2010 ??). With all of the nuisances of eQuest 3.64, I am going to build the model from scrathc and put in all the relevant baseline data in by hand.  And, by the way, the ASHRAE baseline model might be an entirely different system.  I am just completing an EPACT evaluation (ASHRAE 90.1-2001) and the Baseline HVAC was screwe chillers, whereas the Actual building was packaged units with Turbocor compressors (ask me how I did that).

	 

	It very much depends on the complexity of the building. A 40,000 sf office or a 500,000 sf hotel with casino facilites.

	 

	I am unfamiliar with the LEED paperwork to be filled out after the modeling has been done. But I would not do anything of this type in under 120 hours, preferably 160 hours. If the client thinks he can do better, let him.

	 

	Contingency, contingency.

	Marcus,
	
	You have inadvertently hit upon why IBPSA worked with ASHRAE to create a BEMP certification. That's Building Energy Modeling Professional (BEMP). 
	
	Some of us who have been in the field for awhile began to worry a couple of years ago when so many new energy modelers began appearing on the listserv with questions. Their questions indicated a lack of training and experience that was worrisome. What made it worrisome was that they didn't seem to realize that they were as inexperienced as they were; they didn't appear to be pursuing training to learn how to do what they were doing; and we were uncertain as to how or if they were practicing quality control. We hoped that by creating a path to certification that we would give clients one more qualification to look for in their modelers.
	
	If you have been in this industry for any length of time, and by industry I mean the overall construction industry, you know that you don't get a lot of chances if your work doesn't pan out. If your energy model says I have a LEED Gold building and I'm going to save $4,000/year and what I really get is LEED Silver and $1,000/year, I am not going to be happy. So, I will probably not give you any more work but, even worse for all of us, I'll start expressing doubts about the whole process. LEED - what is it good for?
	
	So, now we all have more training, right? We read our ASHRAE Handbooks and technical manuals so we know how to model the difficult stuff. We can find any topic in the DOE2 Manuals, all of which are one line, available, and easily searchable. 
	
	So now we are so good we can do these models in 40-80 hours. Really? Not me and I've been doing it longer than everyone, except you, John Aulbach. So I'm going to join Marcus in his rant because he's on to something.
	
	It's up to us to not under bid this work. It's up to us to educate our clients about the importance of quality in this process. If they think they are getting the same analysis in 40 hours that they used to get in 120 hours, they need to be led around to rethinking that and to be reminded that GIGO.
	
	Cheers,
	
	Carol

Doing models to determine LEED points does not transform the market, save any energy, and just circumvents the purpose behind LEED. (the next version actually requires design phase modeling!)

		 

		Any ?modeler? who does only final models without attempting to explain to the owner why this is a bad idea should be ?drummed out of the corp? in my humble opinion.

		 

		The problem is that if you respond to this RFP with 120 or 160 or more hours to really do the design phase modeling right, you will go up against the ?modeler? who claims to be able to do it in far less time.  So how do we get the folks who issue the RFPs to ask for a proper scope of work so that they can compare fees on a level playing field?  It is unfortunate that we are even having a discussion about doing modeling work in opposition to its purpose.

		Now, given that you have never done a LEED model, it will take you more time, possibly up to 40 more hours.

LEED always encourage ciritisizers??to light a candle rather than to curse the darkness. ?Certainly building on LEED's success?is the correct approach. All?the suggestions that we hear (including mine) are good hopes,?but I think LEED has the resources now to do some research to validate?the viability of the different alternatives and point capturing. For example,? do we have any research that shows the benefet?of assigning parking spaces to?hypbrid cars, or?bycicle racks, etc??

Marcus, Jeremy, David and others: 



Thanks so much!? Your responses helped fill in a gap ? in my experience, establishing early EUI targets has indeed felt ?arbitrary,? and it?s precisely because of the litany of issues brought up regarding what really makes for an appropriate comparison.? 



The exercise of determining an appropriate EUI target has proven deceptively challenging, in my experience.? The energy star target finder will generate a number to run with minimal effort, which is great, but when that target is scrutinized by skeptical minds, it can be hard to justify/defend how ?realistic? that target is for a given project, considering all the unknowns behind the figure. ?These include attributes like age of construction (for renovation projects), unique building geometries, scheduling and more.? David?s response summed up some of the unknowns well, imho. 



Suffice to say, some of us in the energy modeling trenches could use some assistance/reassurance in methods of establishing well-grounded EUI targets? ?In constructing ?Implementation? language for the ?preliminary modeling? credit under discussion, I would personally like to see some specific guidance/examples to this end, or else a reference to a standard illustrating the same.? I feel somewhat disillusioned regarding EUI targets and their resulting effects on the design process, but it?s apparent others have had some pretty positive experiences, so I?d like to learn more! 



~Nick 



PS: I know written words don?t always read the way they were intended, but my query/analogy regarding EUI targets is not intended to criticize or judge others? practices! ?I only mean to illustrate what I?ve been struggling with, if only to share experiences and learn from the discussion!

I guess this is where I enter this interesting discussion.? The selection of an EUI should definitely not be arbitrary.? In fact, the LEED-EB rating system already provides a good example of how to choose an appropriate target EUI: Energy Star.? Target Finder can be used for this, or you can build your own spreadsheet from the technical descriptions at http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=evaluate_performance.bus_portfoliomanager_model_tech_desc .? Most of the variables you need to set the target EUI are schematic level: anticipated hours of operation, gross floor area, number of occupants, HDD/CDD. 



At the same time, looking at the AIA design milestones, I would be concerned if a project experiences changes that have a significant impact on energy consumption after 75% CD, maybe even 50% CD depending on the project.? I could see a late decision to use MERV 13 filters causing an increase in fan energy, but that decision can also be mitigated through other variables such as filter surface area. 



There needs to be some change to the process to prioritize the right decisions first.? Energy needs to be part of the decision model for a building at the early phases of the project, part of site selection for projects that are defined that way or part of the pro forma for developments that start with a fixed site.? In many cases, it is part of those, but with no connection to the remainder of the decision model. 



On your analogy, Nick, I?d suggest that using a goal of designing the best building possible within time/budget constraints is more akin to just getting in a car and driving.? Who?s to judge if you actually arrive at your destination?? You might be able to say you had a good trip and the drive was a success, but would it have been more successful if you knew where you were going and how to get there most efficiently?? However, starting with a destination in mind allows you to better plan your trip from a time/budget perspective.? Just having an EUI goal doesn?t mean that you ignore the energy impact of decisions.? It just means that you have another criteria to let you know if you?re making the right decision.? The flip side is also true: if a decision is made late in the design that negatively affects EUI, you can catch it.? The EUI goal is more like having a GPS on your driving trip, letting you know if you make a wrong turn along the way.

First of all the goal is not at all arbitrary but must be based on an expected outcome within a reasonable expectation.? It is informed by data from similar, actual building energy consumption. ?I don?t think I need to explain the tools one can use to do this. 



Your goal (do the best you can) sounds like, ?let?s build an energy efficient building?.? This is meaningless.? Energy efficiency in the context of new construction is always relative and without a quantification of what energy efficient means this is no goal at all. 



Like any early stage performance goal the number is adjustable as more is discovered in the design process.? If the target is later discovered to be unreasonable due to a wide range of potential issues, then the target is adjusted. 



If you pick your EUI goal the way you describe then yes this is a worthless goal but the key point is that it is never selected arbitrarily.

Not to be a jerk, but to ask an honest question: what is the point?? I?ve been involved with ?established energy target? projects and never really picked up on the logic behind it ? I would appreciate a layman?s explanation. 



Put another way:? If you select an arbitrary EUI or watts per square foot at the earliest stages of design, what have you gained in design process?? If/when a project ?meets the goal? mid-design, are future design decisions supposed to de-emphasize energy impact (no!)? ?If on the other hand, a project finds that target unreasonable down the road, what then?? 



Not setting a mile-marker like this implies designing the best building you can given the time/budget available and any other constraints? that seems more likely to result in the best end-result to me. 



To draw analogy, if design of a LEED (or any energy-conscious) project is like planning a road trip from Kansas to Florida, setting EUI goals seems something like choosing a rest stop by throwing a dart at the map blindfolded. ?It doesn?t help you get to your destination any more efficiently, it may be far out of the way, and now you?ve got a hole in the wall? what was the point? 



Okay, maybe a weak analogy ? chalking it up to a very long week =).? Honestly, I?d appreciate someone laying the value behind this approach ? I?m expect the logic does exist, and I just haven?t yet seen the light!

Arpan, 



Based on the Weidt Group paper, I?m guessing you?re emphasizing architectural considerations that affect the energy cost vs. LEED points numbers. (The paper uses window-to-wall ratios and daylighting as an example.) I would think the goal during the programming and schematic design phases should be energy cost, not LEED points relative to the App. G baseline. Much of the energy cost savings vs. App. G baseline (EAc1 points) is going to come later from the mechanical and lighting designs. The suggestions in the paper to establish specific baseline building shapes and glazing percentages would add a LOT more modeling time ? you?d have to create two separate building geometries for the baseline and proposed models, not to mention different zoning patterns, space types, lighting power per space etc. 



For mechanical design, once the size and programming of the project is established, the baseline model properties are pretty well set, unless you consider fuel-switching and go between baseline systems 1/3/5/7 to systems 2/4/6/8. One exception I can think of for a design decision that results in higher energy cost but better comparison with the App. G baseline is higher ventilation rates combined with heat recovery in the proposed and no heat recovery in the baseline. 



Regards, 

Bill

Marcus, thank you incorporating this language. 





The one scenario we often see in our design guidance work is that a proposed design when compared with other design alternates does not necessarily provided the largest energy savings when compared against its own baseline case model. It is difficult to make a recommendation as consultants when we want to present the Owner with both real energy cost savings without compromising their LEED certification level targets. ?

NC, CS, SCHOOLS, RETAIL, WAREHOUSE & DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, HOSPITALITY 

Establish an energy performance target no later than the schematic design phase. The target must be established as kBTU per square foot-year of source energy use. This target must be mapped on the same scale as the baseline and proposed buildings, if the project follows Option 1. 



OPTION 1. Whole Building Energy Simulation 

Analyze a minimum of at least nine efficiency measures during the design process and account for the results in design decision-making. Analysis can include energy simulation of efficiency opportunities, application of past energy simulation analyses for similar projects to the project, or application of published data from energy analyses performed for similar projects to the project (such as AEDGs). 



A minimum of six energy efficiency measures focused on load reduction strategies appropriate for the facility must be analyzed. This analysis must be performed during the schematic design phase. 



A minimum of three energy efficiency measures focused on HVAC related strategies must be analyzed (passive measures are acceptable). This analysis must be performed before the conclusion of the design development phase. 



The results of the analysis must be summarized in a brief report or memorandum. 





The next version of LEED will be going out for public comment again in July, I think, so please comment formally as well as discussing here.

Marcus, 

You have inadvertently hit upon why IBPSA worked with ASHRAE to create a BEMP certification. That's Building Energy Modeling Professional (BEMP). 

Some of us who have been in the field for awhile began to worry a couple of years ago when so many new energy modelers began appearing on the listserv with questions. Their questions indicated a lack of training and experience that was worrisome. What made it worrisome was that they didn't seem to realize that they were as inexperienced as they were; they didn't appear to be pursuing training to learn how to do what they were doing; and we were uncertain as to how or if they were practicing quality control. We hoped that by creating a path to certification that we would give clients one more qualification to look for in their modelers. 

If you have been in this industry for any length of time, and by industry I mean the overall construction industry, you know that you don't get a lot of chances if your work doesn't pan out. If your energy model says I have a LEED Gold building and I'm going to save $4,000/year and what I really get is LEED Silver and $1,000/year, I am not going to be happy. So, I will probably not give you any more work but, even worse for all of us, I'll start expressing doubts about the whole process. LEED - what is it good for? 

So, now we all have more training, right? We read our ASHRAE Handbooks and technical manuals so we know how to model the difficult stuff. We can find any topic in the DOE2 Manuals, all of which are one line, available, and easily searchable. 

So now we are so good we can do these models in 40-80 hours. Really? Not me and I've been doing it longer than everyone, except you, John Aulbach. So I'm going to join Marcus in his rant because he's on to something. 

It's up to us to not under bid this work. It's up to us to educate our clients about the importance of quality in this process. If they think they are getting the same analysis in 40 hours that they used to get in 120 hours, they need to be led around to rethinking that and to be reminded that GIGO. 

Cheers, 

Carol

In our experience a final model, done right, would take about 80 hours. 



WARNING ? frustrated modeling rant to follow: 



Doing just a final model however completely misses the point as to why we model ? it is to guide design decisions!? 



If I saw this RFP and all it asked me for was a model to determine LEED points, during or after design, I would try to educate the potential client about the purpose of modeling. 



Unfortunately too many projects pursuing LEED are only doing the minimum when it comes to modeling and almost completely missing all the benefits.? Too often the ?market? transforms only based on a least first cost denominator basis that results in little real transformation.? Doing models to determine LEED points does not transform the market, save any energy, and just circumvents the purpose behind LEED. (the next version actually requires design phase modeling!) 



Any ?modeler? who does only final models without attempting to explain to the owner why this is a bad idea should be ?drummed out of the corp? in my humble opinion. 



The problem is that if you respond to this RFP with 120 or 160 or more hours to really do the design phase modeling right, you will go up against the ?modeler? who claims to be able to do it in far less time.? So how do we get the folks who issue the RFPs to ask for a proper scope of work so that they can compare fees on a level playing field? ?It is unfortunate that we are even having a discussion about doing modeling work in opposition to its purpose. 



Sorry for the rant but I feel better now. J

Omar, 



I would expect, for a building this size, approximately 40 hours (multiply by your hourly rate). The 40 hours include EAp2/EAc1 LEED documentation, and any review you may have to respond to later. 



Now, given that you have never done a LEED model, it will take you more time, possibly up to 40 more hours.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Energy Model Cost 



Greetings everyone, 



I have a question regarding the cost of an energy model for a LEED project. Every energy model I've done so far has been for 

existing buildings, mainly for optimization purposes. However, I received an RFP to model a five-story, 41,500 sq. ft. building 

that's currently on the design phase and is pursuing the LEED-NC Silver certification. I really have no idea what would be a fair 

price for this model since I'm going to have to use Appendix G (ASHRAE 90.1) to evaluate the difference between the base 

and proposed buildings. I don't know how much extra effort this will take. I know the procedure, just haven't done it before. 



Can you shed any light on this issue? 



Thanks in advance!

I did some pre-RFP modeling for Denver Housing Authority to try to help 
them develop realistic & useful energy metric design goals for a recent 
project.  We ended up setting a percent energy cost saving goal (ie 
LEED) along with a site /lbs CO2 emissions/ SF/ goal for the design.  We 
started out with a kBtu/ SF metric, but weren't happy with the way this 
quantified environmental impact in Colorado.  This is because most of 
our electricity comes from coal and it's CO2 intensive relative to 
natural gas, but looks better than natural gas when looking at site 
kBtu/ SF.  It's interesting how this will change design decisions 
compared to just looking at energy cost savings relative to the ASHRAE 
90.1 baseline; it's much easier to hit 50% savings with an all electric 
building, but CO2 emissions go up.
The metrics DHA ended up included in their RFP came out of modeling the 
actual building type in the actual location of the project, so we were 
comfortable with them being reasonable design goals for the 
'as-designed' building.  We also made sure that people understood the 
difference between 'as-designed' modeling and 'operational' building 
energy use.  It was great to work with a really progressive client who 
gets it and wanted to look at these details closely.

It's interesting that just as we are having this discussion, the budget for
CBECS is going away:
http://blog.bepinfo.com/2011/05/death-knell-for-energy-star-building.html.
So even one less source of EUI information for people to use. Ironic!

It's like herding cats.

Our practice is heavily involved with Government projects, all of which need to comply with the various laws (EPACT and EISA) and Executive Orders that drive building energy savings performance in addition to project specific performance within the LEED rating system.

It is an interesting analysis process, as we have to evaluate energy (kBtu) vs. cost (utility) vs. fossil fuel use (FFU) (including utility grid impacts) savings, all with the goal of meeting minimum performance goals of 30% for EPACT (a 90.1-2004 baseline, which can be increased on an agency/department basis, as in one case has been raised to 50% energy savings compared to a 90.1-2007 baseline), minimum 10% (which usually ends up 30% or higher) for LEED, and a minimum 55% FFU reduction for EISA (ratcheted up to 100% avoidance by 2030).

With the singular exception of the EISA FFU requirement, all measures to achieve stated goals must be proven Life Cycle Cost (LCC) effective or compliance can be waived.

While a DOE proposed EISA ruling, if promulgated, pushes off the EISA FFU reduction requirement for at least one year, this one law (if unaltered, by law or interpretive rule) is the heavy hitter as it requires either a substantial change in our utility grid system (to eliminate fossil fuels) or forces the project to be off the grid (or forces the Agency or Department head to officially ask for a waiver for non-compliance).

Why do I bring all of this up?

If USGBC is pursuing the goal of seeking energy savings (kBtu) in addition to utility savings (and they can be at cross purposes, as with thermal storage), then shouldn't it also seek to reduce greenhouse gases, as in fossil fuel reduction? A balance could be sought, as an example consider that a tri-generation process can produce less greenhouse gases compared to an open-loop heat pump approach given the fossil fuel type used by the electric utility provider.

Of course, to be technically correct, there are the greenhouse and environmental impacts to be considered with natural gas fracking (also with coal mining and off-shore drilling).

I'm sure there are plans for expansion of our nuclear power generation on the grid, with its own inherent concerns.

Deep geothermal, if available, does seem to offer the best promise for a 24 hour supply source.  Solar, hydronic and PV just doesn't seem to be LCC effective except for the most expensive utility rate structures.

It's interesting that just as we are having this discussion, the budget for CBECS is going away: http://blog.bepinfo.com/2011/05/death-knell-for-energy-star-building.html. So even one less source of EUI information for people to use. Ironic!

I did some pre-RFP modeling for Denver Housing Authority to try to help them develop realistic & useful energy metric design goals for a recent project.  We ended up setting a percent energy cost saving goal (ie LEED) along with a site lbs CO2 emissions/ SF goal for the design.  We started out with a kBtu/ SF metric, but weren't happy with the way this quantified environmental impact in Colorado.  This is because most of our electricity comes from coal and it's CO2 intensive relative to natural gas, but looks better than natural gas when looking at site kBtu/ SF.  It's interesting how this will change design decisions compared to just looking at energy cost savings relative to the ASHRAE 90.1 baseline; it's much easier to hit 50% savings with an all electric building, but CO2 emissions go up.
The metrics DHA ended up included in their RFP came out of modeling the actual building type in the actual location of the project, so we were comfortable with them being reasonable design goals for the 'as-designed' building.  We also made sure that people understood the difference between 'as-designed' modeling and 'operational' building energy use.  It was great to work with a really progressive client who gets it and wanted to look at these details closely.

One variation I was considering to EUI was to look at Kbtu per annual occupant hour vs. Kbtu per area. This came about when I wanted know how to evaluate some operational alternatives such as extending the hours of operation for a facility, or looking at an office running with a rotating staff all working 4x10 hour days a week vs. a smaller static staff in the same building working 5x8 hour days a week. Kbtu/sf2 alone didn't help here, but looking at Kbtu per annual occupant hour did.



Extending operational hours will clearly increase your Kbtu/ft2 (EUI) but the question I wanted to answer is if those extra occupant hours come at a lower energy impact per occupant hour than the baseline case. "Kbtu/ annual occupant hour" addressed this. Is there a similar metric that anyone else is using?

Paul,



The next version of LEED will approach a more standardized metric (EUI Source

Energy) but still include cost as a metric as well.  For those who feel

strongly that only actual energy use should be used for green building

certification the LEED EBOM methodologies will be allowed into LEED BD+C

projects.



USGBC is trying hard to lead us to that better way.  If you know the better

way please share.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Costs of energy modeling for compliance
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=kVT5BWjxVVCCXax6ujdjOwkM4Og@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All---I've gotten in on the latter part of the convos and know that it
has somewhat shifted to an EUI discussion.   I would like to offer a a
couple things for discussion regarding the costs of simulation for
compliance and how I've been successful with some pricing and unsuccessful
in other ways...


   1. FYI---the average amount of hours that I price for all my energy
   models is a min of 120 hours to get the models completed and another 20-30
   hours for completing the LEED docs and then there is more time to account
   for when you have to spend time responding to the LEED comments and
   remodeling what they want you to change....this is another 20-40 hours of
   work depending on the number of comments and the things that have to be
   remodeled.  So now we are looking at 180-200 hours for a standard LEED model
   fee.   BUT this is not the final answer for fees because we still have the
   factor of "how big is the building", a 5,000ft2 model versus a 150,000ft2
   model will be priced more on a scale of $/ft2 and then hopefully it also
   translates into a nice hourly rate for the services and hours....
      - on an hourly fee basis the simulation fee should come in around
      $20,000 for 200 hours @ $100 per hour.
      - on a cost per area fee basis the simulation fee should range from
      $0.50 to 0.10 per ft2.  This would yield a fee range of $2500 (for the
      5000ft2 building) to $15,000 (for the 150,000 ft2 building).
If you can
      get a 150,000 ft2 building at a higher fee then I would say your an even
      BIGGER winner...my experience has shown that the market fees for our
      complicated services are bottoming out around $15,000-20,000 per
model for
      larger models of significant complexity with HVAC systems.
      - NOW---I have also seen and succussfully bid for fees higher than
      $20,000 for large models, BUT there is always some other
signficant factor
      or complication that affords the higher fee (as a one-time outlier
      project.)   These factors may be client relations, grant/incentive funds,
      lucky day, etc. but it goes to stand that the higher simulation fees for
      individual projects usually have a "sweet spot" that is being
acknowledged
      when that happens.--by my simulation consulting experiences.
      - As someone who agrees with those that spoke of "educate the client"
      I always go in the bid with a higher fee (i.e. $32,500 fixed
fee) and then
      will leave myself some room to oblige a discount (which is
*always*asked for) and then still not cut my own throat for the sake
of thier larger
      corporation & construction budget...at this fee I can offer up to a 25%
      discount and still come in at $24,375---This fee translates to
$0.16/ft2.
      I started the bid at $0.21/ft2.
      - Looking at this same fee from from a $/hour basis, for 200 hours at
      $24,375 = $122/hour.    I started the bid at $162.50/hour knowing that I
      would have to come in with a discount to the client...BUT REMEMBER  my
      client has been educated on the *REAL* amount of time and experience
      needed to provide them with a professional and a quality model.   Even
      though I'm an independent modeler I still submit all of my reports on my
      company letterhead and formal report format.  My professional
logo graces my
      client correspondence so that I am providing the most
professional services
      that my client can justify paying for the scope of work he/she is
      receiving.  How can a client feel good about paying over $10,000 (or even
      $5000) for a Word document they couldv'e produced
themselves...really, show
      some professionalism and SKILL and make your reports and energy
results look
      good and "feel good" for your client.  That is part of what they
are paying
      for in your services, and if you give good services you can receive good
      fees for those services.

......So if the end of the fee calculations shows an acceptable fee for both
parties (i.e. $122/hour, or fixed fee of $25,000 for the 150,000 Green
Compliance model) then go ahead and ask for this fee.   We have to ask for
the right fees in order for our market to understand and respect the true
work and time that is needed for every model.  If you have more room to
wiggle, maybe wiggle a little bit, but don't disrespect the real effort and
value of these services.  Why don't we get paid as a percentage of the
annual energy savings that we are intstrumental in estimating and
implementing??    I'd love a fee of .5% of a large construction budget for
my energy modeling services

I did a pricing presentation for one of my clients who asked me one time,
"How is the best way to price or value the cost of energy simulations?"   I
asked them if they had ever showed a profit on any of thier energy models
and they told me NO.   As I suspected because I remember those
experiences.   Our industry does need to develop some costing "rules of
thumb" to value our services and skills by.   We also really need to find
more SUPPORT FROM GBCI & USGBC for the cost of simulation LEED Compliance
models because as my experience has shown since working on LEED version 2.0
up until this new version of LEED for EAp2 & EAc1...they are asking for WAY
more documentation and copy work and modeling detail than in the
beginning--yet the market fees have not moved an inch in 10-15 years.  I
don't think many people can actualy average more than $100 per hour on any
project scope when the invoice is actually sent to the client.--which means
there is no profit to be made if you are coming in at your costs.

On at least 85% of my projects there is always "something" that happens to
extend or request 'just a few more hours' of work to keep the client
happy.    Those 'few more hours' *always always always* come out of
someone's pocket...and now as a business owner they are always coming out of
my pocket--such is the nature of being a business owner, but the point is
that the client and simulator/project mgr need to be able to mange the
projects so that they don't run over what the buget has been set
for.    More industry support for both education and cost increases of
modeling fees would be helpful to all businesses offering compliance
simulation services.

okay--I'll take a breath and step off the box.  Thanks,
Oh--if anyone wants to see a copy of my pricing presentation contact me
308-763-1593.  I'm happy to share all the info I've gathered on simulation
pricing & fees.

Cheers,
Pasha

The EAp2c1 credit for thermal storage would be minimal I think but it does
exist as currently written.  Since the proposed metric is a combination of
cost and EUI, thermal storage should do better in one and probably worse in
the other.

 

Not sure how we could separate out the systems in the models for EAp2c1, but
you make a good point about potential double counting (not always a bad
thing for LEED if it is something we really want to encourage like
renewables).

While we have Marcus's attention, I would like to rant !

 

Since the next version of LEED will have a credit dedicated to peak demand
reduction, can we make it so that credit cannot be taken for EAp2c1 for
thermal energy storage systems?

 

The peak demand credit already addresses reduction of power generation at
the power plant scale, so optimize energy performance can be more true to
reduction of site energy.

 

Too many towers apply no energy conservation measures to internal gains and
simply transfer their cooling requirements to their CALMAC tanks.

Julia,

 

I appreciate your thoughts and input.

 

In my opinion early stage modeling (or a reasonable facsimile) should be
required for every green building project.  Doing a model at the end for
those average projects serves no real purpose and is frankly a waste of
everyone?s time (see previous rant).  If we continue to allow this for LEED
the market will never change.  Keep in mind we are talking about LEED and
its stated purpose is market transformation.  The typical project should not
be able to get LEED certified if it works properly in the market.  Right now
the market has caught up to LEED in many ways.  If it does not stay ahead of
the market then it ceases to have any meaning whatsoever.  So, if not now,
when?

 

I don?t disagree that  the current requirements are rather prescriptive and
that the number of iterations should vary project-to-project.  I am
struggling to come up with an alternative that still requires design phase
modeling.

 

One can still earn the prerequisite without early stage modeling, but cannot
earn any points for EAc1 as it is now proposed.  I don?t think an ID credit
would give enough incentive, too easy to ignore.  There are prescriptive
paths specifically to address small projects.

Omar,
This is cracking me up.  I don't think I've ever seen this much traffic on
one issue!  LOL.
Regarding the manhours for a LEED model - my opinion is that the amount of
time has much more to do with the level of certification the project is
going for, at what point the modeling services are engaged in the design,
and the type and complexity of the building (systems).  That's not to say
the number of manhours is completely independent of building size (square
footage), but its not particularly sensitive to it.  I find that that there
is a high "low" and low "high" for modeling.  In other words, it's hard to
complete an energy model in less than 60-80 hours (all said and done -
paperwork, LEED responses etc), but it rarely take more than 250 hours.
(Although, some rare complex projects going for platinmum could take up to
350 hours).  Like others, I find the norm for a reasonably complex bldg
going for LEED silver or gold typically requires between 120 and 160 hours. 

Marcus  
Here's my two cents on below. I will look for the public comment period as
well.  Thanks for the heads up.
I think the idea of incentivizing modeling early in the design is a great
idea, but I think requiring it is completely inappropriate.  Perhaps it
could be encouraged by awarding an extra (innovation? or EA cr 1?) point for
starting modeling in schematic design.  Or, perhaps the credit could be
restructured similar to the CX credits where in order to get the enhanced CX
credits, you have to have the CX agent involved early in the design.  In
some ways, the current set up already does this though with the progress
points for increased levels of saving.  Quite frankly, if you are going for
50% savings, you're not gonig to get there unless you start modeling really
early in the process.
  
I also think prescribing a certain minimum number of ECMs to look at is
inappropriate and would probably have the adverse effect of discouraging
energy modeling.  The appropriate number of ECMs is highly project dependent
- based on building size, scope, complexity, type, level of LEED
certification shooting for, and not least of all the owner's budget.  Let's
face it, the vast majority of bldgs out there and that consume most of the
energy in the US are (strip) malls, grocery stores, restaurants etc.  These
projects barely event have a schematic, design and CD phase.  While we all
love to work on the exotic, platinum level, cutting edge, bldgs that are
likely to have a large budget for design, these are not the majority of
bldgs consuming energy.  I think we should be doing more to encourage
modeling and energy savings amongst the every day projects than the "sexy"
projects.  It seems to me the best way to do this is to offer incentives in
this direction in lieu of prescriptive requirements that could
discourage/put off smaller projects from even attempting to incorporate
modeling.

If anyone has any good ideas about how to structure the LEED credits to end
the practice of validation models at the end and encourage/require design
phase modeling the folks on the USGBC EA TAG would love to hear them.  The
current proposed credit language from the first public comment phase is
listed below.

 

NC, CS, SCHOOLS, RETAIL, WAREHOUSE & DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, HOSPITALITY

Establish an energy performance target no later than the schematic design
phase. The target must be established as kBTU per square foot-year of source
energy use. This target must be mapped on the same scale as the baseline and
proposed buildings, if the project follows Option 1.

 

OPTION 1. Whole Building Energy Simulation 

Analyze a minimum of at least nine efficiency measures during the design
process and account for the results in design decision-making. Analysis can
include energy simulation of efficiency opportunities, application of past
energy simulation analyses for similar projects to the project, or
application of published data from energy analyses performed for similar
projects to the project (such as AEDGs).

 

A minimum of six energy efficiency measures focused on load reduction
strategies appropriate for the facility must be analyzed. This analysis must
be performed during the schematic design phase.

 

A minimum of three energy efficiency measures focused on HVAC related
strategies must be analyzed (passive measures are acceptable). This analysis
must be performed before the conclusion of the design development phase.

 

The results of the analysis must be summarized in a brief report or
memorandum.

 

 

The next version of LEED will be going out for public comment again in July,
I think, so please comment formally as well as discussing here.

OK, Carol..now you threw the "bait" out there..older than dirt, eh?

 

I have done very limited LEED "type" modeling where you compare 20 walls and
40 windows types (well, it seemed that way). Correct me if I am wrong, but a
Base model must be built to comply with a certain level of ASHRAE 90.1 (now
up to 2010 ??). With all of the nuisances of eQuest 3.64, I am going to
build the model from scrathc and put in all the relevant baseline data in by
hand.  And, by the way, the ASHRAE baseline model might be an entirely
different system.  I am just completing an EPACT evaluation (ASHRAE
90.1-2001) and the Baseline HVAC was screwe chillers, whereas the Actual
building was packaged units with Turbocor compressors (ask me how I did
that).

 

It very much depends on the complexity of the building. A 40,000 sf office
or a 500,000 sf hotel with casino facilites.

 

I am unfamiliar with the LEED paperwork to be filled out after the modeling
has been done. But I would not do anything of this type in under 120 hours,
preferably 160 hours. If the client thinks he can do better, let him.

 

Contingency, contingency.

 

We won't discuss how old CAROL might be..

Marcus,

You have inadvertently hit upon why IBPSA worked with ASHRAE to create a
BEMP certification. That's Building Energy Modeling Professional (BEMP). 

Some of us who have been in the field for awhile began to worry a couple of
years ago when so many new energy modelers began appearing on the listserv
with questions. Their questions indicated a lack of training and experience
that was worrisome. What made it worrisome was that they didn't seem to
realize that they were as inexperienced as they were; they didn't appear to
be pursuing training to learn how to do what they were doing; and we were
uncertain as to how or if they were practicing quality control. We hoped
that by creating a path to certification that we would give clients one more
qualification to look for in their modelers.

If you have been in this industry for any length of time, and by industry I
mean the overall construction industry, you know that you don't get a lot of
chances if your work doesn't pan out. If your energy model says I have a
LEED Gold building and I'm going to save $4,000/year and what I really get
is LEED Silver and $1,000/year, I am not going to be happy. So, I will
probably not give you any more work but, even worse for all of us, I'll
start expressing doubts about the whole process. LEED - what is it good for?

So, now we all have more training, right? We read our ASHRAE Handbooks and
technical manuals so we know how to model the difficult stuff. We can find
any topic in the DOE2 Manuals, all of which are one line, available, and
easily searchable. 

So now we are so good we can do these models in 40-80 hours. Really? Not me
and I've been doing it longer than everyone, except you, John Aulbach. So
I'm going to join Marcus in his rant because he's on to something.

It's up to us to not under bid this work. It's up to us to educate our
clients about the importance of quality in this process. If they think they
are getting the same analysis in 40 hours that they used to get in 120
hours, they need to be led around to rethinking that and to be reminded that
GIGO.

Cheers,

Carol

In our experience a final model, done right, would take about 80 hours.

 

WARNING ? frustrated modeling rant to follow:

 

Doing just a final model however completely misses the point as to why we
model ? it is to guide design decisions!  

 

If I saw this RFP and all it asked me for was a model to determine LEED
points, during or after design, I would try to educate the potential client
about the purpose of modeling.

 

Unfortunately too many projects pursuing LEED are only doing the minimum
when it comes to modeling and almost completely missing all the benefits.
Too often the ?market? transforms only based on a least first cost
denominator basis that results in little real transformation.  Doing models
to determine LEED points does not transform the market, save any energy, and
just circumvents the purpose behind LEED. (the next version actually
requires design phase modeling!)

 

Any ?modeler? who does only final models without attempting to explain to
the owner why this is a bad idea should be ?drummed out of the corp? in my
humble opinion.

 

The problem is that if you respond to this RFP with 120 or 160 or more hours
to really do the design phase modeling right, you will go up against the
?modeler? who claims to be able to do it in far less time.  So how do we get
the folks who issue the RFPs to ask for a proper scope of work so that they
can compare fees on a level playing field?  It is unfortunate that we are
even having a discussion about doing modeling work in opposition to its
purpose.

 

Sorry for the rant but I feel better now. J

I would expect, for a building this size, approximately 40 hours (multiply

any review you may have to respond to later.

 

Now, given that you have never done a LEED model, it will take you more

Greetings everyone,

 

I have a question regarding the cost of an energy model for a LEED project.
Every energy model I've done so far has been for 

existing buildings, mainly for optimization purposes. However, I received an
RFP to model a five-story, 41,500 sq. ft. building

that's currently on the design phase and is pursuing the LEED-NC Silver
certification. I really have no idea what would be a fair 

price for this model since I'm going to have to use Appendix G (ASHRAE 90.1)
to evaluate the difference between the base 

and proposed buildings. I don't know how much extra effort this will take. I
know the procedure, just haven't done it before.

 

Can you shed any light on this issue?

 

Thanks in advance!

Hi Karen,

 

I certainly agree that the enforcement of the requirements should be
flexible.  The difficulty we face is related to the review of the
documentation submitted.  Individual subjectivity in the review process can
sometimes lead to inconsistency, so the more flexible, the more subjective.

 

Appreciate the feedback.

Hi Marcus,

 

Thanks for asking us for our feedback.  I welcome this opportunity to give
you some information regarding my experience as a LEED modeler and some
ideas I have for making the modeling part more useful.

 

Many of the LEED projects I work on do not use LEED as a design tool.  For
these projects, even though my initial proposal includes schematic design
and design development modeling, I am usually asked to complete only the
final LEED model and LEED model documentation, ie "please do only what is
required for LEED."  This means that the modeling tool is not being used to
make design decisions.

 

I like that the new EA C1 language talks about using energy modeling to
inform design decisions, and I think that it would be helpful to engage this
list-serve to determine the best way to bring that goal into the LEED
requirements.  One thing that comes to mind is that I use many tools during
design development phase energy modeling.  Often, I'll complete thermal
modeling of building envelope details in order to help the architect reach
achieve a higher overall R-value for envelope constructions.  While not a
whole-building energy analysis, this is often one of the most illuminating
discussions I have with architects.  Often I will run a simple model with
R-20, R-30 and R-40 walls, we'll look at overall energy use differences and
the engineer will look at benefits to system sizing and then the major
conversation is: how do we construct the building so that we actually
achieve an overall R-value that meets our goals, not just in the center of
the wall.

 

Sometimes I prepare a detailed report for model alternatives, the best
results come from sitting down with the design team, running a number of
alternatives and viewing and discussing results all at the same time.  The
LEED documentation requirement for this portion of the credit should be
similarly flexible.  

 

Thanks for your time,

The primary purpose is to get the conversation started, early.  It is an
opportunity to educate the owner and the team about energy.  In my
experience the majority of designers can?t even tell you the metric for
comparing building energy consumption.  I have often had this conversation
early in the project design and have been met with blank stares.  It is
incumbent upon us who do understand these energy issues to get the
conversation started.  Caveat the heck out of the goal, explain the
limitations, discuss the relative vs absolute metrics, be open about the
issues ? so that we can raise awareness one conversation at a time.  This is
the power of a market transformation tool like LEED.  It enables us to have
these conversations.

 

I agree that both of these items are potential issues, talk to your clients
about them.  If you don?t have a goal, how do you measure success?

While I conceptually agree with and understand the kbtu or watts/sf
approach, to me, there seems to be some series issues with it in reality.

First, I don't agree that generating or coming up with appropriate target
values during design is always (or even frequently) an easy thing to do or
easy data to find.  It depends on your bldg type.  I do a lot of labs and
hospitals.  Manufacturing and industrial use bldgs can have the same issues.
Good EUI data is not easy to come by for these bldg types - partly because
the user equipment that is installed in them can be a big portion of the
energy demand and consumption and it's always changing and can be very
specific to each client.  For example: is it a community hosptial with more
modest and generic care provide?....a state of the art hospital with
specialized care functions?....does the lab have primarily biology or a
chemistry functions....etc etc.  These things all affect the EUI.  In my
opinion, the best resource for this data is actually utility companies based
on data from similar customers, but that data is not generally publicly
available and/or the population of similar comparable buildings may be small
and difficult to relate to your bldg.  

Second, quite frankly, in my opinion, DESIGN phase energy models are poor
predictors of ACTUAL bldg energy use.  They are best at predicting RELATIVE
(comparative) energy use.  This is not because the tools are not good or
inaccurate but because we and the owners are so poor at predicting how the
bldg will actually be used, weather, etc.  One additional factor, is what
equipment will actually be installed.  It's not uncommon for the technology
to have changed bewteen the time that we start design and the time the
equipment is actually purchased closer to the end of construction.  All
these things effect not only the equipment w/sf usage but the ac w/sf usage
etc.   So, there seems to me to be a serious disconnect to me if we talking
about setting energy targets during DESIGNbased on statistical data of
ACTUAL energy use and trying to use those figure during the design phase for
predicted energy use.  Again, I love the idea but are we really there yet in
reality.  It seems to me we need a lot more data that doesn't exist yet -
and mechanism to collect that data.  (CBECS etc are good, but the population
and variability for bldgs of these types has a long way to go).

I missing something about what's being proposed/talked about?

First of all the goal is not at all arbitrary but must be based on an
expected outcome within a reasonable expectation.  It is informed by data
from similar, actual building energy consumption.  I don?t think I need to
explain the tools one can use to do this.

 

Your goal (do the best you can) sounds like, ?let?s build an energy
efficient building?.  This is meaningless.  Energy efficiency in the context
of new construction is always relative and without a quantification of what
energy efficient means this is no goal at all.

 

Like any early stage performance goal the number is adjustable as more is
discovered in the design process.  If the target is later discovered to be
unreasonable due to a wide range of potential issues, then the target is
adjusted.

 

If you pick your EUI goal the way you describe then yes this is a worthless
goal but the key point is that it is never selected arbitrarily.

Not to be a jerk, but to ask an honest question: what is the point?  I?ve
been involved with ?established energy target? projects and never really
picked up on the logic behind it ? I would appreciate a layman?s
explanation.

 

Put another way:  If you select an arbitrary EUI or watts per square foot at
the earliest stages of design, what have you gained in design process?
If/when a project ?meets the goal? mid-design, are future design decisions
supposed to de-emphasize energy impact (no!)?  If on the other hand, a
project finds that target unreasonable down the road, what then?  

 

Not setting a mile-marker like this implies designing the best building you
can given the time/budget available and any other constraints? that seems
more likely to result in the best end-result to me.

 

To draw analogy, if design of a LEED (or any energy-conscious) project is
like planning a road trip from Kansas to Florida, setting EUI goals seems
something like choosing a rest stop by throwing a dart at the map
blindfolded.  It doesn?t help you get to your destination any more
efficiently, it may be far out of the way, and now you?ve got a hole in the
wall? what was the point?

 

Okay, maybe a weak analogy ? chalking it up to a very long week =).
Honestly, I?d appreciate someone laying the value behind this approach ? I?m
expect the logic does exist, and I just haven?t yet seen the light!

Arpan,

 

Based on the Weidt Group paper, I?m guessing you?re emphasizing
architectural considerations that affect the energy cost vs. LEED points
numbers. (The paper uses window-to-wall ratios and daylighting as an
example.) I would think the goal during the programming and schematic design
phases should be energy cost, not LEED points relative to the App. G
baseline. Much of the energy cost savings vs. App. G baseline (EAc1 points)
is going to come later from the mechanical and lighting designs. The
suggestions in the paper to establish specific baseline building shapes and
glazing percentages would add a LOT more modeling time ? you?d have to
create two separate building geometries for the baseline and proposed
models, not to mention different zoning patterns, space types, lighting
power per space etc.

 

For mechanical design, once the size and programming of the project is
established, the baseline model properties are pretty well set, unless you
consider fuel-switching and go between baseline systems 1/3/5/7 to systems
2/4/6/8. One exception I can think of for a design decision that results in
higher energy cost but better comparison with the App. G baseline is higher
ventilation rates combined with heat recovery in the proposed and no heat
recovery in the baseline.

 

Regards,

Bill

Marcus, thank you incorporating this language.

 

The one scenario we often see in our design guidance work is that a proposed
design when compared with other design alternates does not necessarily
provided the largest energy savings when compared against its own baseline
case model. It is difficult to make a recommendation as consultants when we
want to present the Owner with both real energy cost savings without
compromising their LEED certification level targets.

proposed buildings, if the project follows Option 1.

 

OPTION 1. Whole Building Energy Simulation 

Analyze a minimum of at least nine efficiency measures during the design
process and account for the results in design decision-making. Analysis can
include energy simulation of efficiency opportunities, application of past
energy simulation analyses for similar projects to the project, or
application of published data from energy analyses performed for similar
projects to the project (such as AEDGs).

 

A minimum of six energy efficiency measures focused on load reduction
strategies appropriate for the facility must be analyzed. This analysis must
be performed during the schematic design phase.

 

A minimum of three energy efficiency measures focused on HVAC related
strategies must be analyzed (passive measures are acceptable). This analysis
must be performed before the conclusion of the design development phase.

 

The results of the analysis must be summarized in a brief report or
memorandum.

 

 

The next version of LEED will be going out for public comment again in July,
I think, so please comment formally as well as discussing here.

OK, Carol..now you threw the "bait" out there..older than dirt, eh?

 

I have done very limited LEED "type" modeling where you compare 20 walls and
40 windows types (well, it seemed that way). Correct me if I am wrong, but a
Base model must be built to comply with a certain level of ASHRAE 90.1 (now
up to 2010 ??). With all of the nuisances of eQuest 3.64, I am going to
build the model from scrathc and put in all the relevant baseline data in by
hand.  And, by the way, the ASHRAE baseline model might be an entirely
different system.  I am just completing an EPACT evaluation (ASHRAE
90.1-2001) and the Baseline HVAC was screwe chillers, whereas the Actual
building was packaged units with Turbocor compressors (ask me how I did
that).

 

It very much depends on the complexity of the building. A 40,000 sf office
or a 500,000 sf hotel with casino facilites.

 

I am unfamiliar with the LEED paperwork to be filled out after the modeling
has been done. But I would not do anything of this type in under 120 hours,
preferably 160 hours. If the client thinks he can do better, let him.

 

Contingency, contingency.

 

We won't discuss how old CAROL might be..

Marcus,

You have inadvertently hit upon why IBPSA worked with ASHRAE to create a
BEMP certification. That's Building Energy Modeling Professional (BEMP). 

Some of us who have been in the field for awhile began to worry a couple of
years ago when so many new energy modelers began appearing on the listserv
with questions. Their questions indicated a lack of training and experience
that was worrisome. What made it worrisome was that they didn't seem to
realize that they were as inexperienced as they were; they didn't appear to
be pursuing training to learn how to do what they were doing; and we were
uncertain as to how or if they were practicing quality control. We hoped
that by creating a path to certification that we would give clients one more
qualification to look for in their modelers.

If you have been in this industry for any length of time, and by industry I
mean the overall construction industry, you know that you don't get a lot of
chances if your work doesn't pan out. If your energy model says I have a
LEED Gold building and I'm going to save $4,000/year and what I really get
is LEED Silver and $1,000/year, I am not going to be happy. So, I will
probably not give you any more work but, even worse for all of us, I'll
start expressing doubts about the whole process. LEED - what is it good for?

So, now we all have more training, right? We read our ASHRAE Handbooks and
technical manuals so we know how to model the difficult stuff. We can find
any topic in the DOE2 Manuals, all of which are one line, available, and
easily searchable. 

So now we are so good we can do these models in 40-80 hours. Really? Not me
and I've been doing it longer than everyone, except you, John Aulbach. So
I'm going to join Marcus in his rant because he's on to something.

It's up to us to not under bid this work. It's up to us to educate our
clients about the importance of quality in this process. If they think they
are getting the same analysis in 40 hours that they used to get in 120
hours, they need to be led around to rethinking that and to be reminded that
GIGO.

Cheers,

Carol

In our experience a final model, done right, would take about 80 hours.

 

WARNING ? frustrated modeling rant to follow:

 

Doing just a final model however completely misses the point as to why we
model ? it is to guide design decisions!  

 

If I saw this RFP and all it asked me for was a model to determine LEED
points, during or after design, I would try to educate the potential client
about the purpose of modeling.

 

Unfortunately too many projects pursuing LEED are only doing the minimum
when it comes to modeling and almost completely missing all the benefits.
Too often the ?market? transforms only based on a least first cost
denominator basis that results in little real transformation.  Doing models
to determine LEED points does not transform the market, save any energy, and
just circumvents the purpose behind LEED. (the next version actually
requires design phase modeling!)

 

Any ?modeler? who does only final models without attempting to explain to
the owner why this is a bad idea should be ?drummed out of the corp? in my
humble opinion.

 

The problem is that if you respond to this RFP with 120 or 160 or more hours
to really do the design phase modeling right, you will go up against the
?modeler? who claims to be able to do it in far less time.  So how do we get
the folks who issue the RFPs to ask for a proper scope of work so that they
can compare fees on a level playing field?  It is unfortunate that we are
even having a discussion about doing modeling work in opposition to its
purpose.

 

Sorry for the rant but I feel better now. J

I would expect, for a building this size, approximately 40 hours (multiply
by your hourly rate). The 40 hours include EAp2/EAc1 LEED documentation, and
any review you may have to respond to later.

 

Now, given that you have never done a LEED model, it will take you more

Greetings everyone,

 

I have a question regarding the cost of an energy model for a LEED project.
Every energy model I've done so far has been for 

existing buildings, mainly for optimization purposes. However, I received an
RFP to model a five-story, 41,500 sq. ft. building

that's currently on the design phase and is pursuing the LEED-NC Silver
certification. I really have no idea what would be a fair 

price for this model since I'm going to have to use Appendix G (ASHRAE 90.1)
to evaluate the difference between the base 

and proposed buildings. I don't know how much extra effort this will take. I
know the procedure, just haven't done it before.

 

Can you shed any light on this issue?

 

Thanks in advance!

Interesting ideas Chris.

One of the biggest obstacles in design is bridging/explaining the gap between absolute goals and relative comparisons.

I appreciate all the comments received.

Sounds like perhaps we need a benchmarking standard/guideline and an energy modeling process standard/guideline to reference for LEED.  Jason has proposed to get the later started.  Anyone know of anything in existence or getting started to help with the former for new construction projects?

Subject: RE: [Bldg-sim] Energy Model Cost - best design doesn'tequalmostLEED points

All:

I've been intrigued ever since I saw RMI's presentation on how target EUI's were set for the showcase Empire State Building renovation - where an innovative approach was used to define the building's "technical potential to achieve" and then measuring success by the team's ability to deliver a cost effective project than meets the "technical potential to achieve" as much as possible, while balancing all other needs.  Here's a nice summary - http://www.retrofitdepot.org/Content/Files/ESBCaseStudy.pdf	

I've been thinking that, in general, re-framing energy performance success (i.e. EA C1 points) not as a "% better than an Appendix G Baseline" but to "% below the building's semi-unique technical potential to achieve" - might have interesting and positive effects.  By that I mean, imagine an office building designed and predicted to consume (on a site EUI basis) an EUI of 89 kBtu/ft2, while the technical potential to achieve might have been determined to be 70 kBtu/ft2.   This represents a (1-(89/70)) = 27% gap, which say falls between 25% and 30% and it worth 3 EA C1 pts. 

The ASHRAE Standard 100 Revision Committee has been working with some unique "hybrid" approaches combining "prototype or reference building energy models" and CBECS data to generate regional EUI targets based on building composition, building size, and building operating hours. The proposed revision of ASHRAE Standard 100 (not yet out for public comment) will incorporate a procedure for generating a building specific EUI for setting retrofit performance targets.  Here's a link to a presentation by Terry Sharp where he describes the basic concept under "Option 3" -  http://tc76.org/docs/programs/ASRHAE%20std%20100%20%20Sem%2020102520June_Sharp.ppt Remember that EPA Target Finder is based exclusively on the EPA Portfolio Manager models, which are based on a number of different years of CBECS surveys, dependent on the space type. 

It's not too much of a stretch to imagine, following the general principles from above and the methods described in proposed revision to Standard 100, to be able to generate a unique 'semi-custom' EUI for your building project - maybe it might look something like this:

1) Download appropriate DOE prototype model(s)
2) Add appropriate exterior shading (adjacent buildings, etc.) 
3) Replace building fabric elements with appropriate benchmark elements for your building type (retrofit / new construction) 
4) Replace 'asset' related elements (lights, equipment) with appropriate benchmark elements for your building type  (retrofit / new construction)
4) Generate site EUI results with a weather file for your location.
5) If necessary, combine (area weight) EUI to result in whole building "Potential to Achieve"

In this way, one ends up with a semi-custom EUI performance target to measure success against - a target could be "better defined" than what you can currently get from EAP Target Finder.   I can envision a consensus document which lays out a specifications and procedure for allowable alteration of the DOE models, in order to generate the "Potential to Achieve EUI", after which the % difference from an "As Designed" case translate to EA C1 points.  I know this is NOT the original purpose of the DOE Benchmark Buildings, but with careful thought, and community consensus, I think a process of something like this may move the centroid of the community in the right direction. The energy usage 'goal' would be known as soon as the program was set, and the design team can react from there.  Also, the resulting "As Designed" model could be more useful, at would be meant to represent actual building performance to the best of the knowledge of the design team.  

Thoughts?

All the Best,

_Chris

The primary purpose is to get the conversation started, early.  It is an opportunity to educate the owner and the team about energy.  In my experience the majority of designers can?t even tell you the metric for comparing building energy consumption.  I have often had this conversation early in the project design and have been met with blank stares.  It is incumbent upon us who do understand these energy issues to get the conversation started.
Caveat the heck out of the goal, explain the limitations, discuss the relative vs absolute metrics, be open about the issues ? so that we can raise awareness one conversation at a time.  This is the power of a market transformation tool like LEED.  It enables us to have these conversations.

 

I agree that both of these items are potential issues, talk to your clients about them.  If you don?t have a goal, how do you measure success?

While I conceptually agree with and understand the kbtu or watts/sf approach, to me, there seems to be some series issues with it in reality.

First, I don't agree that generating or coming up with appropriate target values during design is always (or even frequently) an easy thing to do or easy data to find.  It depends on your bldg type.  I do a lot of labs and hospitals.  Manufacturing and industrial use bldgs can have the same issues.
Good EUI data is not easy to come by for these bldg types - partly because the user equipment that is installed in them can be a big portion of the energy demand and consumption and it's always changing and can be very specific to each client.  For example: is it a community hosptial with more modest and generic care provide?....a state of the art hospital with specialized care functions?....does the lab have primarily biology or a chemistry functions....etc etc.  These things all affect the EUI.  In my opinion, the best resource for this data is actually utility companies based on data from similar customers, but that data is not generally publicly available and/or the population of similar comparable buildings may be small and difficult to relate to your bldg.  

Second, quite frankly, in my opinion, DESIGN phase energy models are poor predictors of ACTUAL bldg energy use.  They are best at predicting RELATIVE
(comparative) energy use.  This is not because the tools are not good or inaccurate but because we and the owners are so poor at predicting how the bldg will actually be used, weather, etc.  One additional factor, is what equipment will actually be installed.  It's not uncommon for the technology to have changed bewteen the time that we start design and the time the equipment is actually purchased closer to the end of construction.  All these things effect not only the equipment w/sf usage but the ac w/sf usage etc.
So, there seems to me to be a serious disconnect to me if we talking about setting energy targets during DESIGNbased on statistical data of ACTUAL energy use and trying to use those figure during the design phase for predicted energy use.  Again, I love the idea but are we really there yet in reality.  It seems to me we need a lot more data that doesn't exist yet - and mechanism to collect that data.  (CBECS etc are good, but the population and variability for bldgs of these types has a long way to go).

I missing something about what's being proposed/talked about?

First of all the goal is not at all arbitrary but must be based on an expected outcome within a reasonable expectation.  It is informed by data from similar, actual building energy consumption.  I don?t think I need to explain the tools one can use to do this.

 

Your goal (do the best you can) sounds like, ?let?s build an energy efficient building?.  This is meaningless.  Energy efficiency in the context of new construction is always relative and without a quantification of what energy efficient means this is no goal at all.

 

Like any early stage performance goal the number is adjustable as more is discovered in the design process.  If the target is later discovered to be unreasonable due to a wide range of potential issues, then the target is adjusted.

 

If you pick your EUI goal the way you describe then yes this is a worthless goal but the key point is that it is never selected arbitrarily.

Not to be a jerk, but to ask an honest question: what is the point?  I?ve been involved with ?established energy target? projects and never really picked up on the logic behind it ? I would appreciate a layman?s explanation.

 

Put another way:  If you select an arbitrary EUI or watts per square foot at the earliest stages of design, what have you gained in design process?
If/when a project ?meets the goal? mid-design, are future design decisions supposed to de-emphasize energy impact (no!)?  If on the other hand, a project finds that target unreasonable down the road, what then?  

 

Not setting a mile-marker like this implies designing the best building you can given the time/budget available and any other constraints? that seems more likely to result in the best end-result to me.

 

To draw analogy, if design of a LEED (or any energy-conscious) project is like planning a road trip from Kansas to Florida, setting EUI goals seems something like choosing a rest stop by throwing a dart at the map blindfolded.  It doesn?t help you get to your destination any more efficiently, it may be far out of the way, and now you?ve got a hole in the wall? what was the point?

 

Okay, maybe a weak analogy ? chalking it up to a very long week =).
Honestly, I?d appreciate someone laying the value behind this approach ? I?m expect the logic does exist, and I just haven?t yet seen the light!

Could any one advice why LEED would not put the base design as Watt per square foot, or per occupant, or per hotel bed etc. so the Architecture becomes more innovative early in the design to save energy?

Arpan,

 

Based on the Weidt Group paper, I?m guessing you?re emphasizing architectural considerations that affect the energy cost vs. LEED points numbers. (The paper uses window-to-wall ratios and daylighting as an example.) I would think the goal during the programming and schematic design phases should be energy cost, not LEED points relative to the App. G baseline. Much of the energy cost savings vs. App. G baseline (EAc1 points) is going to come later from the mechanical and lighting designs. The suggestions in the paper to establish specific baseline building shapes and glazing percentages would add a LOT more modeling time ? you?d have to create two separate building geometries for the baseline and proposed models, not to mention different zoning patterns, space types, lighting power per space etc.

 

For mechanical design, once the size and programming of the project is established, the baseline model properties are pretty well set, unless you consider fuel-switching and go between baseline systems 1/3/5/7 to systems 2/4/6/8. One exception I can think of for a design decision that results in higher energy cost but better comparison with the App. G baseline is higher ventilation rates combined with heat recovery in the proposed and no heat recovery in the baseline.

 

Regards,

Bill

Marcus, thank you incorporating this language.

 

The one scenario we often see in our design guidance work is that a proposed design when compared with other design alternates does not necessarily provided the largest energy savings when compared against its own baseline case model. It is difficult to make a recommendation as consultants when we want to present the Owner with both real energy cost savings without compromising their LEED certification level targets.  

A recent paper presented by the Weidt Group at SimBuild touched on this
issue:

	Establish an energy performance target no later than the schematic design phase. The target must be established as kBTU per square foot-year of source energy use. This target must be mapped on the same scale as the baseline and proposed buildings, if the project follows Option 1.

	Analyze a minimum of at least nine efficiency measures during the design process and account for the results in design decision-making.
Analysis can include energy simulation of efficiency opportunities, application of past energy simulation analyses for similar projects to the project, or application of published data from energy analyses performed for similar projects to the project (such as AEDGs).

	 

	A minimum of six energy efficiency measures focused on load reduction strategies appropriate for the facility must be analyzed. This analysis must be performed during the schematic design phase.

	 

	A minimum of three energy efficiency measures focused on HVAC related strategies must be analyzed (passive measures are acceptable). This analysis must be performed before the conclusion of the design development phase.

	 

	The results of the analysis must be summarized in a brief report or memorandum.

	OK, Carol..now you threw the "bait" out there..older than dirt, eh?

	 

	I have done very limited LEED "type" modeling where you compare 20 walls and 40 windows types (well, it seemed that way). Correct me if I am wrong, but a Base model must be built to comply with a certain level of ASHRAE 90.1 (now up to 2010 ??). With all of the nuisances of eQuest 3.64, I am going to build the model from scrathc and put in all the relevant baseline data in by hand.  And, by the way, the ASHRAE baseline model might be an entirely different system.  I am just completing an EPACT evaluation (ASHRAE
90.1-2001) and the Baseline HVAC was screwe chillers, whereas the Actual building was packaged units with Turbocor compressors (ask me how I did that).

	 

	It very much depends on the complexity of the building. A 40,000 sf office or a 500,000 sf hotel with casino facilites.

	 

	I am unfamiliar with the LEED paperwork to be filled out after the modeling has been done. But I would not do anything of this type in under 120 hours, preferably 160 hours. If the client thinks he can do better, let him.

	 

	Contingency, contingency.

	Marcus,
	
	You have inadvertently hit upon why IBPSA worked with ASHRAE to create a BEMP certification. That's Building Energy Modeling Professional (BEMP). 
	
	Some of us who have been in the field for awhile began to worry a couple of years ago when so many new energy modelers began appearing on the listserv with questions. Their questions indicated a lack of training and experience that was worrisome. What made it worrisome was that they didn't seem to realize that they were as inexperienced as they were; they didn't appear to be pursuing training to learn how to do what they were doing; and we were uncertain as to how or if they were practicing quality control. We hoped that by creating a path to certification that we would give clients one more qualification to look for in their modelers.
	
	If you have been in this industry for any length of time, and by industry I mean the overall construction industry, you know that you don't get a lot of chances if your work doesn't pan out. If your energy model says I have a LEED Gold building and I'm going to save $4,000/year and what I really get is LEED Silver and $1,000/year, I am not going to be happy. So, I will probably not give you any more work but, even worse for all of us, I'll start expressing doubts about the whole process. LEED - what is it good for?
	
	So, now we all have more training, right? We read our ASHRAE Handbooks and technical manuals so we know how to model the difficult stuff.
We can find any topic in the DOE2 Manuals, all of which are one line, available, and easily searchable. 
	
	So now we are so good we can do these models in 40-80 hours. Really?
Not me and I've been doing it longer than everyone, except you, John Aulbach.
So I'm going to join Marcus in his rant because he's on to something.
	
	It's up to us to not under bid this work. It's up to us to educate our clients about the importance of quality in this process. If they think they are getting the same analysis in 40 hours that they used to get in 120 hours, they need to be led around to rethinking that and to be reminded that GIGO.
	
	Cheers,
	
	Carol

160 or more hours to really do the design phase modeling right, you will go up against the ?modeler? who claims to be able to do it in far less time.  So how do we get the folks who issue the RFPs to ask for a proper scope of work so that they can compare fees on a level playing field?  It is unfortunate that we are even having a discussion about doing modeling work in opposition to its purpose.

Carbon was considered as a possible metric for LEED 2012.  It was replaced
with EUI because of the weighting criteria applied to the credits.  Since
carbon (i.e. climate change) was already being used to weight the number of
points, it was felt that it should not be both a metric and a weighting
criteria.

It?s like herding cats.

 

Our practice is heavily involved with Government projects, all of which need
to comply with the various laws (EPACT and EISA) and Executive Orders that
drive building energy savings performance in addition to project specific
performance within the LEED rating system.

 

It is an interesting analysis process, as we have to evaluate energy (kBtu)
vs. cost (utility) vs. fossil fuel use (FFU) (including utility grid
impacts) savings, all with the goal of meeting minimum performance goals of
30% for EPACT (a 90.1-2004 baseline, which can be increased on an
agency/department basis, as in one case has been raised to 50% energy
savings compared to a 90.1-2007 baseline), minimum 10% (which usually ends
up 30% or higher) for LEED, and a minimum 55% FFU reduction for EISA
(ratcheted up to 100% avoidance by 2030).

 

With the singular exception of the EISA FFU requirement, all measures to
achieve stated goals must be proven Life Cycle Cost (LCC) effective or
compliance can be waived. 

 

While a DOE proposed EISA ruling, if promulgated, pushes off the EISA FFU
reduction requirement for at least one year, this one law (if unaltered, by
law or interpretive rule) is the heavy hitter as it requires either a
substantial change in our utility grid system (to eliminate fossil fuels) or
forces the project to be off the grid (or forces the Agency or Department
head to officially ask for a waiver for non-compliance).

 

Why do I bring all of this up?

 

If USGBC is pursuing the goal of seeking energy savings (kBtu) in addition
to utility savings (and they can be at cross purposes, as with thermal
storage), then shouldn?t it also seek to reduce greenhouse gases, as in
fossil fuel reduction? A balance could be sought, as an example consider
that a tri-generation process can produce less greenhouse gases compared to
an open-loop heat pump approach given the fossil fuel type used by the
electric utility provider.

 

Of course, to be technically correct, there are the greenhouse and
environmental impacts to be considered with natural gas fracking (also with
coal mining and off-shore drilling). 

 

I?m sure there are plans for expansion of our nuclear power generation on
the grid, with its own inherent concerns.

 

Deep geothermal, if available, does seem to offer the best promise for a 24
hour supply source.  Solar, hydronic and PV just doesn?t seem to be LCC
effective except for the most expensive utility rate structures.

I did some pre-RFP modeling for Denver Housing Authority to try to help them

We ended up setting a percent energy cost saving goal (ie LEED) along with a
site lbs CO2 emissions/ SF goal for the design.  We started out with a kBtu/
SF metric, but weren't happy with the way this quantified environmental
impact in Colorado.  This is because most of our electricity comes from coal
and it's CO2 intensive relative to natural gas, but looks better than
natural gas when looking at site kBtu/ SF.  It's interesting how this will
change design decisions compared to just looking at energy cost savings
relative to the ASHRAE 90.1 baseline; it's much easier to hit 50% savings
with an all electric building, but CO2 emissions go up.
The metrics DHA ended up included in their RFP came out of modeling the
actual building type in the actual location of the project, so we were
comfortable with them being reasonable design goals for the 'as-designed'
building.  We also made sure that people understood the difference between
'as-designed' modeling and 'operational' building energy use.  It was great
to work with a really progressive client who gets it and wanted to look at
these details closely.

Extending operational hours will clearly increase your Kbtu/ft2 (EUI) but
the question I wanted to answer is if those extra occupant hours come at a
lower energy impact per occupant hour than the baseline case. "Kbtu/ annual
occupant hour" addressed this. Is there a similar metric that anyone else is
using?

Paul,
 
The next version of LEED will approach a more standardized metric (EUI
Source
Energy) but still include cost as a metric as well.  For those who feel
strongly that only actual energy use should be used for green building
certification the LEED EBOM methodologies will be allowed into LEED BD+C
projects.
 
USGBC is trying hard to lead us to that better way.  If you know the better
way please share.

I am very passionate about a benchmarking standard/guideline, and there is a lot of research in this area. I will be glad to volunteer and help in this if LEED or any other organization/company is willing to lead the effort.

Interesting ideas Chris. 

One of the biggest obstacles in design is bridging/explaining the gap between absolute goals and relative comparisons. 

I appreciate all the comments received. 

Sounds like perhaps we need a benchmarking standard/guideline and an energy modeling process standard/guideline to reference for LEED. Jason has proposed to get the later started. Anyone know of anything in existence or getting started to help with the former for new construction projects?

All: 

I've been intrigued ever since I saw RMI's presentation on how target EUI's were set for the showcase Empire State Building renovation - where an innovative approach was used to define the building's "technical potential to achieve" and then measuring success by the team's ability to deliver a cost effective project than meets the "technical potential to achieve" as much as possible, while balancing all other needs. Here's a nice summary - http://www.retrofitdepot.org/Content/Files/ESBCaseStudy.pdf 

I've been thinking that, in general, re-framing energy performance success (i.e. EA C1 points) not as a "% better than an Appendix G Baseline" but to "% below the building's semi-unique technical potential to achieve" - might have interesting and positive effects. By that I mean, imagine an office building designed and predicted to consume (on a site EUI basis) an EUI of 89 kBtu/ft2, while the technical potential to achieve might have been determined to be 70 kBtu/ft2. This represents a (1-(89/70)) = 27% gap, which say falls between 25% and 30% and it worth 3 EA C1 pts. 

The ASHRAE Standard 100 Revision Committee has been working with some unique "hybrid" approaches combining "prototype or reference building energy models" and CBECS data to generate regional EUI targets based on building composition, building size, and building operating hours. The proposed revision of ASHRAE Standard 100 (not yet out for public comment) will incorporate a procedure for generating a building specific EUI for setting retrofit performance targets. Here's a link to a presentation by Terry Sharp where he describes the basic concept under "Option 3" - http://tc76.org/docs/programs/ASRHAE%20std%20100%20%20Sem%2020102520June_Sharp.ppt Remember that EPA Target Finder is based exclusively on the EPA Portfolio Manager models, which are based on a number of different years of CBECS surveys, dependent on the space type. 

It's not too much of a stretch to imagine, following the general principles from above and the methods described in proposed revision to Standard 100, to be able to generate a unique 'semi-custom' EUI for your building project - maybe it might look something like this: 

1) Download appropriate DOE prototype model(s) 
2) Add appropriate exterior shading (adjacent buildings, etc.) 
3) Replace building fabric elements with appropriate benchmark elements for your building type (retrofit / new construction) 
4) Replace 'asset' related elements (lights, equipment) with appropriate benchmark elements for your building type (retrofit / new construction) 
4) Generate site EUI results with a weather file for your location. 
5) If necessary, combine (area weight) EUI to result in whole building "Potential to Achieve" 

In this way, one ends up with a semi-custom EUI performance target to measure success against - a target could be "better defined" than what you can currently get from EAP Target Finder. I can envision a consensus document which lays out a specifications and procedure for allowable alteration of the DOE models, in order to generate the "Potential to Achieve EUI", after which the % difference from an "As Designed" case translate to EA C1 points. I know this is NOT the original purpose of the DOE Benchmark Buildings, but with careful thought, and community consensus, I think a process of something like this may move the centroid of the community in the right direction. The energy usage 'goal' would be known as soon as the program was set, and the design team can react from there. Also, the resulting "As Designed" model could be more useful, at would be meant to represent actual building performance to the best of the knowledge of the design team. 

Thoughts? 

All the Best,

The primary purpose is to get the conversation started, early. It is an opportunity to educate the owner and the team about energy. In my experience the majority of designers can?t even tell you the metric for comparing building energy consumption. I have often had this conversation early in the project design and have been met with blank stares. It is incumbent upon us who do understand these energy issues to get the conversation started. 
Caveat the heck out of the goal, explain the limitations, discuss the relative vs absolute metrics, be open about the issues ? so that we can raise awareness one conversation at a time. This is the power of a market transformation tool like LEED. It enables us to have these conversations. 



I agree that both of these items are potential issues, talk to your clients about them. If you don?t have a goal, how do you measure success?

While I conceptually agree with and understand the kbtu or watts/sf approach, to me, there seems to be some series issues with it in reality. 

First, I don't agree that generating or coming up with appropriate target values during design is always (or even frequently) an easy thing to do or easy data to find. It depends on your bldg type. I do a lot of labs and hospitals. Manufacturing and industrial use bldgs can have the same issues. 
Good EUI data is not easy to come by for these bldg types - partly because the user equipment that is installed in them can be a big portion of the energy demand and consumption and it's always changing and can be very specific to each client. For example: is it a community hosptial with more modest and generic care provide?....a state of the art hospital with specialized care functions?....does the lab have primarily biology or a chemistry functions....etc etc. These things all affect the EUI. In my opinion, the best resource for this data is actually utility companies based on data from similar customers, but that data is not generally publicly available and/or the population of similar comparable buildings may be small and difficult to relate to your bldg. 

Second, quite frankly, in my opinion, DESIGN phase energy models are poor predictors of ACTUAL bldg energy use. They are best at predicting RELATIVE 
(comparative) energy use. This is not because the tools are not good or inaccurate but because we and the owners are so poor at predicting how the bldg will actually be used, weather, etc. One additional factor, is what equipment will actually be installed. It's not uncommon for the technology to have changed bewteen the time that we start design and the time the equipment is actually purchased closer to the end of construction. All these things effect not only the equipment w/sf usage but the ac w/sf usage etc. 
So, there seems to me to be a serious disconnect to me if we talking about setting energy targets during DESIGNbased on statistical data of ACTUAL energy use and trying to use those figure during the design phase for predicted energy use. Again, I love the idea but are we really there yet in reality. It seems to me we need a lot more data that doesn't exist yet - and mechanism to collect that data. (CBECS etc are good, but the population and variability for bldgs of these types has a long way to go). 

I missing something about what's being proposed/talked about?

First of all the goal is not at all arbitrary but must be based on an expected outcome within a reasonable expectation. It is informed by data from similar, actual building energy consumption. I don?t think I need to explain the tools one can use to do this. 



Your goal (do the best you can) sounds like, ?let?s build an energy efficient building?. This is meaningless. Energy efficiency in the context of new construction is always relative and without a quantification of what energy efficient means this is no goal at all. 



Like any early stage performance goal the number is adjustable as more is discovered in the design process. If the target is later discovered to be unreasonable due to a wide range of potential issues, then the target is adjusted. 



If you pick your EUI goal the way you describe then yes this is a worthless goal but the key point is that it is never selected arbitrarily.

Not to be a jerk, but to ask an honest question: what is the point? I?ve been involved with ?established energy target? projects and never really picked up on the logic behind it ? I would appreciate a layman?s explanation. 



Put another way: If you select an arbitrary EUI or watts per square foot at the earliest stages of design, what have you gained in design process? 
If/when a project ?meets the goal? mid-design, are future design decisions supposed to de-emphasize energy impact (no!)? If on the other hand, a project finds that target unreasonable down the road, what then? 



Not setting a mile-marker like this implies designing the best building you can given the time/budget available and any other constraints? that seems more likely to result in the best end-result to me. 



To draw analogy, if design of a LEED (or any energy-conscious) project is like planning a road trip from Kansas to Florida, setting EUI goals seems something like choosing a rest stop by throwing a dart at the map blindfolded. It doesn?t help you get to your destination any more efficiently, it may be far out of the way, and now you?ve got a hole in the wall? what was the point? 



Okay, maybe a weak analogy ? chalking it up to a very long week =). 
Honestly, I?d appreciate someone laying the value behind this approach ? I?m expect the logic does exist, and I just haven?t yet seen the light!

Arpan, 



Based on the Weidt Group paper, I?m guessing you?re emphasizing architectural considerations that affect the energy cost vs. LEED points numbers. (The paper uses window-to-wall ratios and daylighting as an example.) I would think the goal during the programming and schematic design phases should be energy cost, not LEED points relative to the App. G baseline. Much of the energy cost savings vs. App. G baseline (EAc1 points) is going to come later from the mechanical and lighting designs. The suggestions in the paper to establish specific baseline building shapes and glazing percentages would add a LOT more modeling time ? you?d have to create two separate building geometries for the baseline and proposed models, not to mention different zoning patterns, space types, lighting power per space etc. 



For mechanical design, once the size and programming of the project is established, the baseline model properties are pretty well set, unless you consider fuel-switching and go between baseline systems 1/3/5/7 to systems 2/4/6/8. One exception I can think of for a design decision that results in higher energy cost but better comparison with the App. G baseline is higher ventilation rates combined with heat recovery in the proposed and no heat recovery in the baseline. 



Regards, 

Bill

Marcus, thank you incorporating this language. 



The one scenario we often see in our design guidance work is that a proposed design when compared with other design alternates does not necessarily provided the largest energy savings when compared against its own baseline case model. It is difficult to make a recommendation as consultants when we want to present the Owner with both real energy cost savings without compromising their LEED certification level targets.

If anyone has any good ideas about how to structure the LEED credits to end the practice of validation models at the end and encourage/require design phase modeling the folks on the USGBC EA TAG would love to hear them. 
The current proposed credit language from the first public comment phase is listed below. 



NC, CS, SCHOOLS, RETAIL, WAREHOUSE & DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, HOSPITALITY 

Establish an energy performance target no later than the schematic design phase. The target must be established as kBTU per square foot-year of source energy use. This target must be mapped on the same scale as the baseline and proposed buildings, if the project follows Option 1. 



OPTION 1. Whole Building Energy Simulation 

Analyze a minimum of at least nine efficiency measures during the design process and account for the results in design decision-making. 
Analysis can include energy simulation of efficiency opportunities, application of past energy simulation analyses for similar projects to the project, or application of published data from energy analyses performed for similar projects to the project (such as AEDGs). 



A minimum of six energy efficiency measures focused on load reduction strategies appropriate for the facility must be analyzed. This analysis must be performed during the schematic design phase. 



A minimum of three energy efficiency measures focused on HVAC related strategies must be analyzed (passive measures are acceptable). This analysis must be performed before the conclusion of the design development phase. 



The results of the analysis must be summarized in a brief report or memorandum. 





The next version of LEED will be going out for public comment again in July, I think, so please comment formally as well as discussing here.

OK, Carol..now you threw the "bait" out there..older than dirt, eh? 



I have done very limited LEED "type" modeling where you compare 20 walls and 40 windows types (well, it seemed that way). Correct me if I am wrong, but a Base model must be built to comply with a certain level of ASHRAE 90.1 (now up to 2010 ??). With all of the nuisances of eQuest 3.64, I am going to build the model from scrathc and put in all the relevant baseline data in by hand. And, by the way, the ASHRAE baseline model might be an entirely different system. I am just completing an EPACT evaluation (ASHRAE 
90.1-2001) and the Baseline HVAC was screwe chillers, whereas the Actual building was packaged units with Turbocor compressors (ask me how I did that). 



It very much depends on the complexity of the building. A 40,000 sf office or a 500,000 sf hotel with casino facilites. 



I am unfamiliar with the LEED paperwork to be filled out after the modeling has been done. But I would not do anything of this type in under 120 hours, preferably 160 hours. If the client thinks he can do better, let him. 



Contingency, contingency. 



We won't discuss how old CAROL might be..

Marcus, 

You have inadvertently hit upon why IBPSA worked with ASHRAE to create a BEMP certification. That's Building Energy Modeling Professional (BEMP). 

Some of us who have been in the field for awhile began to worry a couple of years ago when so many new energy modelers began appearing on the listserv with questions. Their questions indicated a lack of training and experience that was worrisome. What made it worrisome was that they didn't seem to realize that they were as inexperienced as they were; they didn't appear to be pursuing training to learn how to do what they were doing; and we were uncertain as to how or if they were practicing quality control. We hoped that by creating a path to certification that we would give clients one more qualification to look for in their modelers. 

If you have been in this industry for any length of time, and by industry I mean the overall construction industry, you know that you don't get a lot of chances if your work doesn't pan out. If your energy model says I have a LEED Gold building and I'm going to save $4,000/year and what I really get is LEED Silver and $1,000/year, I am not going to be happy. So, I will probably not give you any more work but, even worse for all of us, I'll start expressing doubts about the whole process. LEED - what is it good for? 

So, now we all have more training, right? We read our ASHRAE Handbooks and technical manuals so we know how to model the difficult stuff. 
We can find any topic in the DOE2 Manuals, all of which are one line, available, and easily searchable. 

So now we are so good we can do these models in 40-80 hours. Really? 
Not me and I've been doing it longer than everyone, except you, John Aulbach. 
So I'm going to join Marcus in his rant because he's on to something. 

It's up to us to not under bid this work. It's up to us to educate our clients about the importance of quality in this process. If they think they are getting the same analysis in 40 hours that they used to get in 120 hours, they need to be led around to rethinking that and to be reminded that GIGO. 

Cheers, 

Carol

WARNING ? frustrated modeling rant to follow: 



Doing just a final model however completely misses the point as to why we model ? it is to guide design decisions! 



If I saw this RFP and all it asked me for was a model to determine LEED points, during or after design, I would try to educate the potential client about the purpose of modeling. 



Unfortunately too many projects pursuing LEED are only doing the minimum when it comes to modeling and almost completely missing all the benefits. Too often the ?market? transforms only based on a least first cost denominator basis that results in little real transformation. Doing models to determine LEED points does not transform the market, save any energy, and just circumvents the purpose behind LEED. (the next version actually requires design phase modeling!) 



Any ?modeler? who does only final models without attempting to explain to the owner why this is a bad idea should be ?drummed out of the corp? in my humble opinion. 



The problem is that if you respond to this RFP with 120 or 
160 or more hours to really do the design phase modeling right, you will go up against the ?modeler? who claims to be able to do it in far less time. So how do we get the folks who issue the RFPs to ask for a proper scope of work so that they can compare fees on a level playing field? It is unfortunate that we are even having a discussion about doing modeling work in opposition to its purpose. 



Sorry for the rant but I feel better now. J

I would expect, for a building this size, approximately 40 hours (multiply by your hourly rate). The 40 hours include EAp2/EAc1 LEED documentation, and any review you may have to respond to later. 



Now, given that you have never done a LEED model, it will take you more time, possibly up to 40 more hours.

Greetings everyone, 



I have a question regarding the cost of an energy model for a LEED project. Every energy model I've done so far has been for 

existing buildings, mainly for optimization purposes. 
However, I received an RFP to model a five-story, 41,500 sq. ft. building 

that's currently on the design phase and is pursuing the LEED-NC Silver certification. I really have no idea what would be a fair 

price for this model since I'm going to have to use Appendix G (ASHRAE 90.1) to evaluate the difference between the base 

and proposed buildings. I don't know how much extra effort this will take. I know the procedure, just haven't done it before. 



Can you shed any light on this issue?

RE the potential for double counting and thermal storage, has any thought been given to the value/detriment of storage systems depending on carbon profile of off-peak vs. on-peak emissions?  I could perhaps see allowing the "double counting" (this might be too much effort to implement) if the thermal storage CHW production uses renewable or a cleaner-than-gas (assumed for peaking units) electricity generation source, but not if the baseload/nighttime generation uses more carbon intensive generation mix.

We've add projects with both sides of the coin, and though the financials penned out in favor of TES, it can seem a bit counterproductive environmentally on one side of the coin.

The EAp2c1 credit for thermal storage would be minimal I think but it does exist as currently written.  Since the proposed metric is a combination of cost and EUI, thermal storage should do better in one and probably worse in the other.

Not sure how we could separate out the systems in the models for EAp2c1, but you make a good point about potential double counting (not always a bad thing for LEED if it is something we really want to encourage like renewables).

While we have Marcus's attention, I would like to rant !

Since the next version of LEED will have a credit dedicated to peak demand reduction, can we make it so that credit cannot be taken for EAp2c1 for thermal energy storage systems?

The peak demand credit already addresses reduction of power generation at the power plant scale, so optimize energy performance can be more true to reduction of site energy.

Too many towers apply no energy conservation measures to internal gains and simply transfer their cooling requirements to their CALMAC tanks.

Julia,

I appreciate your thoughts and input.

In my opinion early stage modeling (or a reasonable facsimile) should be required for every green building project.  Doing a model at the end for those average projects serves no real purpose and is frankly a waste of everyone's time (see previous rant).  If we continue to allow this for LEED the market will never change.  Keep in mind we are talking about LEED and its stated purpose is market transformation.  The typical project should not be able to get LEED certified if it works properly in the market.  Right now the market has caught up to LEED in many ways.  If it does not stay ahead of the market then it ceases to have any meaning whatsoever.  So, if not now, when?

I don't disagree that  the current requirements are rather prescriptive and that the number of iterations should vary project-to-project.  I am struggling to come up with an alternative that still requires design phase modeling.

One can still earn the prerequisite without early stage modeling, but cannot earn any points for EAc1 as it is now proposed.  I don't think an ID credit would give enough incentive, too easy to ignore.  There are prescriptive paths specifically to address small projects.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Energy Model Cost

Omar,
This is cracking me up.  I don't think I've ever seen this much traffic on one issue!  LOL.
Regarding the manhours for a LEED model - my opinion is that the amount of time has much more to do with the level of certification the project is going for, at what point the modeling services are engaged in the design, and the type and complexity of the building (systems).  That's not to say the number of manhours is completely independent of building size (square footage), but its not particularly sensitive to it.  I find that that there is a high "low" and low "high" for modeling.  In other words, it's hard to complete an energy model in less than 60-80 hours (all said and done - paperwork, LEED responses etc), but it rarely take more than 250 hours.  (Although, some rare complex projects going for platinmum could take up to 350 hours).  Like others, I find the norm for a reasonably complex bldg going for LEED silver or gold typically requires between 120 and 160 hours.

Marcus
Here's my two cents on below. I will look for the public comment period as well.  Thanks for the heads up.
I think the idea of incentivizing modeling early in the design is a great idea, but I think requiring it is completely inappropriate.  Perhaps it could be encouraged by awarding an extra (innovation? or EA cr 1?) point for starting modeling in schematic design.  Or, perhaps the credit could be restructured similar to the CX credits where in order to get the enhanced CX credits, you have to have the CX agent involved early in the design.  In some ways, the current set up already does this though with the progress points for increased levels of saving.  Quite frankly, if you are going for 50% savings, you're not gonig to get there unless you start modeling really early in the process.

I also think prescribing a certain minimum number of ECMs to look at is inappropriate and would probably have the adverse effect of discouraging energy modeling.  The appropriate number of ECMs is highly project dependent - based on building size, scope, complexity, type, level of LEED certification shooting for, and not least of all the owner's budget.  Let's face it, the vast majority of bldgs out there and that consume most of the energy in the US are (strip) malls, grocery stores, restaurants etc.  These projects barely event have a schematic, design and CD phase.  While we all love to work on the exotic, platinum level, cutting edge, bldgs that are likely to have a large budget for design, these are not the majority of bldgs consuming energy.  I think we should be doing more to encourage modeling and energy savings amongst the every day projects than the "sexy" projects.  It seems to me the best way to do this is to offer incentives in this direction in lieu of prescriptive requirements that could discourage/put off smaller projects from even attempting to incorporate modeling.

Julia

If anyone has any good ideas about how to structure the LEED credits to end the practice of validation models at the end and encourage/require design phase modeling the folks on the USGBC EA TAG would love to hear them.  The current proposed credit language from the first public comment phase is listed below.

NC, CS, SCHOOLS, RETAIL, WAREHOUSE & DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, HOSPITALITY
Establish an energy performance target no later than the schematic design phase. The target must be established as kBTU per square foot-year of source energy use. This target must be mapped on the same scale as the baseline and proposed buildings, if the project follows Option 1.

OPTION 1. Whole Building Energy Simulation
Analyze a minimum of at least nine efficiency measures during the design process and account for the results in design decision-making. Analysis can include energy simulation of efficiency opportunities, application of past energy simulation analyses for similar projects to the project, or application of published data from energy analyses performed for similar projects to the project (such as AEDGs).

A minimum of six energy efficiency measures focused on load reduction strategies appropriate for the facility must be analyzed. This analysis must be performed during the schematic design phase.

A minimum of three energy efficiency measures focused on HVAC related strategies must be analyzed (passive measures are acceptable). This analysis must be performed before the conclusion of the design development phase.

The results of the analysis must be summarized in a brief report or memorandum.


The next version of LEED will be going out for public comment again in July, I think, so please comment formally as well as discussing here.

OK, Carol..now you threw the "bait" out there..older than dirt, eh?

I have done very limited LEED "type" modeling where you compare 20 walls and 40 windows types (well, it seemed that way). Correct me if I am wrong, but a Base model must be built to comply with a certain level of ASHRAE 90.1 (now up to 2010 ??). With all of the nuisances of eQuest 3.64, I am going to build the model from scrathc and put in all the relevant baseline data in by hand.  And, by the way, the ASHRAE baseline model might be an entirely different system.  I am just completing an EPACT evaluation (ASHRAE 90.1-2001) and the Baseline HVAC was screwe chillers, whereas the Actual building was packaged units with Turbocor compressors (ask me how I did that).

It very much depends on the complexity of the building. A 40,000 sf office or a 500,000 sf hotel with casino facilites.

I am unfamiliar with the LEED paperwork to be filled out after the modeling has been done. But I would not do anything of this type in under 120 hours, preferably 160 hours. If the client thinks he can do better, let him.

Contingency, contingency.

We won't discuss how old CAROL might be..

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Energy Model Cost

Marcus,

You have inadvertently hit upon why IBPSA worked with ASHRAE to create a BEMP certification. That's Building Energy Modeling Professional (BEMP).

Some of us who have been in the field for awhile began to worry a couple of years ago when so many new energy modelers began appearing on the listserv with questions. Their questions indicated a lack of training and experience that was worrisome. What made it worrisome was that they didn't seem to realize that they were as inexperienced as they were; they didn't appear to be pursuing training to learn how to do what they were doing; and we were uncertain as to how or if they were practicing quality control. We hoped that by creating a path to certification that we would give clients one more qualification to look for in their modelers.

If you have been in this industry for any length of time, and by industry I mean the overall construction industry, you know that you don't get a lot of chances if your work doesn't pan out. If your energy model says I have a LEED Gold building and I'm going to save $4,000/year and what I really get is LEED Silver and $1,000/year, I am not going to be happy. So, I will probably not give you any more work but, even worse for all of us, I'll start expressing doubts about the whole process. LEED - what is it good for?

So, now we all have more training, right? We read our ASHRAE Handbooks and technical manuals so we know how to model the difficult stuff. We can find any topic in the DOE2 Manuals, all of which are one line, available, and easily searchable.

So now we are so good we can do these models in 40-80 hours. Really? Not me and I've been doing it longer than everyone, except you, John Aulbach. So I'm going to join Marcus in his rant because he's on to something.

It's up to us to not under bid this work. It's up to us to educate our clients about the importance of quality in this process. If they think they are getting the same analysis in 40 hours that they used to get in 120 hours, they need to be led around to rethinking that and to be reminded that GIGO.

Cheers,

Carol

In our experience a final model, done right, would take about 80 hours.

WARNING - frustrated modeling rant to follow:

Doing just a final model however completely misses the point as to why we model - it is to guide design decisions!

If I saw this RFP and all it asked me for was a model to determine LEED points, during or after design, I would try to educate the potential client about the purpose of modeling.

Unfortunately too many projects pursuing LEED are only doing the minimum when it comes to modeling and almost completely missing all the benefits.  Too often the "market" transforms only based on a least first cost denominator basis that results in little real transformation.  Doing models to determine LEED points does not transform the market, save any energy, and just circumvents the purpose behind LEED. (the next version actually requires design phase modeling!)

Any "modeler" who does only final models without attempting to explain to the owner why this is a bad idea should be "drummed out of the corp" in my humble opinion.

The problem is that if you respond to this RFP with 120 or 160 or more hours to really do the design phase modeling right, you will go up against the "modeler" who claims to be able to do it in far less time.  So how do we get the folks who issue the RFPs to ask for a proper scope of work so that they can compare fees on a level playing field?  It is unfortunate that we are even having a discussion about doing modeling work in opposition to its purpose.

Sorry for the rant but I feel better now. :)

Omar,

I would expect, for a building this size, approximately 40 hours (multiply by your hourly rate). The 40 hours include EAp2/EAc1 LEED documentation, and any review you may have to respond to later.

Now, given that you have never done a LEED model, it will take you more time, possibly up to 40 more hours.

Greetings everyone,

I have a question regarding the cost of an energy model for a LEED project. Every energy model I've done so far has been for
existing buildings, mainly for optimization purposes. However, I received an RFP to model a five-story, 41,500 sq. ft. building
that's currently on the design phase and is pursuing the LEED-NC Silver certification. I really have no idea what would be a fair
price for this model since I'm going to have to use Appendix G (ASHRAE 90.1) to evaluate the difference between the base
and proposed buildings. I don't know how much extra effort this will take. I know the procedure, just haven't done it before.

Can you shed any light on this issue?

Thanks in advance!

Hi,

We use eQuest for our energy models. We are now faced with a project 
where we would like to know the effect of stack-effect natural 
ventilation in a 5 storey building and how it can help us undersize the 
mechanical equipment, especially due to night cooling of the concrete 
structure. Further, we would like to use the same modelling for LEED 
compliance. eQuest seems insufficient for this. What is the recommended 
practice for this?

Hi Mimta,

For natural ventilation. I will recommend IES VE. It has tow modules,
MacroFlo and MicroFlo (CFD), which are able to address your specific
requirements at different scales. I've used both modules quite often to
solve particular ventilation (both natural and mechanical
ventilation) issues. TAS and Energy Plus may be able to do the same thing
but I've never used them for ventilation analysis.
Regards,

Cheney

i just received a clarification about the f-factor for 4" slab on grade 
vs 6" slab on grade for the purposes of leed review.  the usgbc response 
(through the website/contact section) is:

"Thank you for your technical customer service inquiry regarding LEED-NC 
v2009: EAc1.  It is assumed that you are following the Performance 
option (Option 1) of EAp2 & EAc1, using Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1.

Yes, the 4" slab (modeled & specified) should meet the requirements for 
LEED purposes.  Please note that there is no F-factor requirement listed 
as part of the Mandatory provisions of Section 5.4; it is only listed 
for the Prescriptive approach requirements of section 5.5, which is not 
necessary for LEED EAp2/EAc1 compliance.

If you model the slab as a 4" slab with 12" of earth (0.75 soil 
conductivity) underneath it in the Proposed Case model, the energy model 
should indicate the U-value of this slab.  You could simply state in 
your submittal (4" slab modeled with 12" of earth with 0.75 Btu/h-ft-? 
soil conductivity, U-value calculated within energy model as x.xx).  
Please be careful to avoid the common mistakes of modeling the slab 
without any earth beneath it, or modeling the Baseline slab "U-value" 
using the "F-factor" values from Tables 5.5-1 - 5.5-8.  F-factors and 
U-values are not interchangeable, of course.  Also, if the energy model 
cannot reflect an F-factor, please model the Baseline slab-on-grade 
floor as a 6 inch concrete slab over earth with a soil conductivity of 
0.75 Btu/h-ft-degree F, in accordance with A6.1.

We trust that this will help you with your process and we thank you for 
your interest in LEED Rating Systems.

The 50% Savings Advanced Energy Design Guide for K-12 School Buildings (publication this fall, free download available from www.ashrae.org/freeaedg) will include a chapter on EUI targets for schools. This chapter provides a methodology for determining targets for your specific project and provides targets (by end use and climate zone) for reference. The EUI targets that are provided were generated from energy simulations using the DOE reference building schools. A draft of the chapter can be downloaded from ftp://aedgpub:3a$ts!d3 at ftp.ashrae.org. The chapter is provided in DRAFT form and electronic dissemination is limited to Bldg-Sim mailing list members only. This file may not be stored on a computer system for the purpose of additional distribution. A physical copy may be printed from the electronic file only for the personal use of the Bldg-Sim mailing list member. The electronic file will be available through June 30 on the FTP site.

A procedure similar to what Chris outlined will be added to the chapter before publication (it is not currently in the draft). It will discuss a way to set your own energy target based on a project specific energy model. In summary, the steps will be as follows: (1) start with the appropriate DOE reference building school, (2) modify the model to include your schedules and climate information, (3) add specialty space types or unique plug loads that are not captured in the DOE model, and (4) run a simulation in your climate to set your own baseline. Your target is 50% of this EUI.

Any feedback to the draft or this procedure would be very helpful.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Energy Model Cost - best design doesn'tequalmost LEED points

All:

I've been intrigued ever since I saw RMI's presentation on how target EUI's were set for the showcase Empire State Building renovation - where an innovative approach was used to define the building's "technical potential to achieve" and then measuring success by the team's ability to deliver a cost effective project than meets the "technical potential to achieve" as much as possible, while balancing all other needs.  Here's a nice summary - http://www.retrofitdepot.org/Content/Files/ESBCaseStudy.pdf

I've been thinking that, in general, re-framing energy performance success (i.e. EA C1 points) not as a "% better than an Appendix G Baseline" but to "% below the building's semi-unique technical potential to achieve" - might have interesting and positive effects.  By that I mean, imagine an office building designed and predicted to consume (on a site EUI basis) an EUI of 89 kBtu/ft2, while the technical potential to achieve might have been determined to be 70 kBtu/ft2.   This represents a (1-(89/70)) = 27% gap, which say falls between 25% and 30% and it worth 3 EA C1 pts.

The ASHRAE Standard 100 Revision Committee has been working with some unique "hybrid" approaches combining "prototype or reference building energy models" and CBECS data to generate regional EUI targets based on building composition, building size, and building operating hours. The proposed revision of ASHRAE Standard 100 (not yet out for public comment) will incorporate a procedure for generating a building specific EUI for setting retrofit performance targets.  Here's a link to a presentation by Terry Sharp where he describes the basic concept under "Option 3" -  http://tc76.org/docs/programs/ASRHAE%20std%20100%20%20Sem%2020102520June_Sharp.ppt Remember that EPA Target Finder is based exclusively on the EPA Portfolio Manager models, which are based on a number of different years of CBECS surveys, dependent on the space type.

It's not too much of a stretch to imagine, following the general principles from above and the methods described in proposed revision to Standard 100, to be able to generate a unique 'semi-custom' EUI for your building project - maybe it might look something like this:

1) Download appropriate DOE prototype model(s)
2) Add appropriate exterior shading (adjacent buildings, etc.)
3) Replace building fabric elements with appropriate benchmark elements for your building type (retrofit / new construction)
4) Replace 'asset' related elements (lights, equipment) with appropriate benchmark elements for your building type  (retrofit / new construction)
4) Generate site EUI results with a weather file for your location.
5) If necessary, combine (area weight) EUI to result in whole building "Potential to Achieve"

In this way, one ends up with a semi-custom EUI performance target to measure success against - a target could be "better defined" than what you can currently get from EAP Target Finder.   I can envision a consensus document which lays out a specifications and procedure for allowable alteration of the DOE models, in order to generate the "Potential to Achieve EUI", after which the % difference from an "As Designed" case translate to EA C1 points.  I know this is NOT the original purpose of the DOE Benchmark Buildings, but with careful thought, and community consensus, I think a process of something like this may move the centroid of the community in the right direction. The energy usage 'goal' would be known as soon as the program was set, and the design team can react from there.  Also, the resulting "As Designed" model could be more useful, at would be meant to represent actual building performance to the best of the knowledge of the design team.

Thoughts?

All the Best,

The primary purpose is to get the conversation started, early.  It is an opportunity to educate the owner and the team about energy.  In my experience the majority of designers can?t even tell you the metric for comparing building energy consumption.  I have often had this conversation early in the project design and have been met with blank stares.  It is incumbent upon us who do understand these energy issues to get the conversation started.
Caveat the heck out of the goal, explain the limitations, discuss the relative vs absolute metrics, be open about the issues ? so that we can raise awareness one conversation at a time.  This is the power of a market transformation tool like LEED.  It enables us to have these conversations.



I agree that both of these items are potential issues, talk to your clients about them.  If you don?t have a goal, how do you measure success?

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Energy Model Cost - best design doesn'tequalmost LEED points



While I conceptually agree with and understand the kbtu or watts/sf approach, to me, there seems to be some series issues with it in reality.

First, I don't agree that generating or coming up with appropriate target values during design is always (or even frequently) an easy thing to do or easy data to find.  It depends on your bldg type.  I do a lot of labs and hospitals.  Manufacturing and industrial use bldgs can have the same issues.
Good EUI data is not easy to come by for these bldg types - partly because the user equipment that is installed in them can be a big portion of the energy demand and consumption and it's always changing and can be very specific to each client.  For example: is it a community hosptial with more modest and generic care provide?....a state of the art hospital with specialized care functions?....does the lab have primarily biology or a chemistry functions....etc etc.  These things all affect the EUI.  In my opinion, the best resource for this data is actually utility companies based on data from similar customers, but that data is not generally publicly available and/or the population of similar comparable buildings may be small and difficult to relate to your bldg.

Second, quite frankly, in my opinion, DESIGN phase energy models are poor predictors of ACTUAL bldg energy use.  They are best at predicting RELATIVE
(comparative) energy use.  This is not because the tools are not good or inaccurate but because we and the owners are so poor at predicting how the bldg will actually be used, weather, etc.  One additional factor, is what equipment will actually be installed.  It's not uncommon for the technology to have changed bewteen the time that we start design and the time the equipment is actually purchased closer to the end of construction.  All these things effect not only the equipment w/sf usage but the ac w/sf usage etc.
So, there seems to me to be a serious disconnect to me if we talking about setting energy targets during DESIGNbased on statistical data of ACTUAL energy use and trying to use those figure during the design phase for predicted energy use.  Again, I love the idea but are we really there yet in reality.  It seems to me we need a lot more data that doesn't exist yet - and mechanism to collect that data.  (CBECS etc are good, but the population and variability for bldgs of these types has a long way to go).

I missing something about what's being proposed/talked about?

First of all the goal is not at all arbitrary but must be based on an expected outcome within a reasonable expectation.  It is informed by data from similar, actual building energy consumption.  I don?t think I need to explain the tools one can use to do this.



Your goal (do the best you can) sounds like, ?let?s build an energy efficient building?.  This is meaningless.  Energy efficiency in the context of new construction is always relative and without a quantification of what energy efficient means this is no goal at all.



Like any early stage performance goal the number is adjustable as more is discovered in the design process.  If the target is later discovered to be unreasonable due to a wide range of potential issues, then the target is adjusted.



If you pick your EUI goal the way you describe then yes this is a worthless goal but the key point is that it is never selected arbitrarily.

Not to be a jerk, but to ask an honest question: what is the point?  I?ve been involved with ?established energy target? projects and never really picked up on the logic behind it ? I would appreciate a layman?s explanation.



Put another way:  If you select an arbitrary EUI or watts per square foot at the earliest stages of design, what have you gained in design process?
If/when a project ?meets the goal? mid-design, are future design decisions supposed to de-emphasize energy impact (no!)?  If on the other hand, a project finds that target unreasonable down the road, what then?



Not setting a mile-marker like this implies designing the best building you can given the time/budget available and any other constraints? that seems more likely to result in the best end-result to me.



To draw analogy, if design of a LEED (or any energy-conscious) project is like planning a road trip from Kansas to Florida, setting EUI goals seems something like choosing a rest stop by throwing a dart at the map blindfolded.  It doesn?t help you get to your destination any more efficiently, it may be far out of the way, and now you?ve got a hole in the wall? what was the point?



Okay, maybe a weak analogy ? chalking it up to a very long week =).
Honestly, I?d appreciate someone laying the value behind this approach ? I?m expect the logic does exist, and I just haven?t yet seen the light!

Arpan,



Based on the Weidt Group paper, I?m guessing you?re emphasizing architectural considerations that affect the energy cost vs. LEED points numbers. (The paper uses window-to-wall ratios and daylighting as an example.) I would think the goal during the programming and schematic design phases should be energy cost, not LEED points relative to the App. G baseline. Much of the energy cost savings vs. App. G baseline (EAc1 points) is going to come later from the mechanical and lighting designs. The suggestions in the paper to establish specific baseline building shapes and glazing percentages would add a LOT more modeling time ? you?d have to create two separate building geometries for the baseline and proposed models, not to mention different zoning patterns, space types, lighting power per space etc.



For mechanical design, once the size and programming of the project is established, the baseline model properties are pretty well set, unless you consider fuel-switching and go between baseline systems 1/3/5/7 to systems 2/4/6/8. One exception I can think of for a design decision that results in higher energy cost but better comparison with the App. G baseline is higher ventilation rates combined with heat recovery in the proposed and no heat recovery in the baseline.



Regards,

Bill

Marcus, thank you incorporating this language.



The one scenario we often see in our design guidance work is that a proposed design when compared with other design alternates does not necessarily provided the largest energy savings when compared against its own baseline case model. It is difficult to make a recommendation as consultants when we want to present the Owner with both real energy cost savings without compromising their LEED certification level targets.

A recent paper presented by the Weidt Group at SimBuild touched on this
issue:

        If anyone has any good ideas about how to structure the LEED credits to end the practice of validation models at the end and encourage/require design phase modeling the folks on the USGBC EA TAG would love to hear them.
The current proposed credit language from the first public comment phase is listed below.



        NC, CS, SCHOOLS, RETAIL, WAREHOUSE & DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, HOSPITALITY

        Establish an energy performance target no later than the schematic design phase. The target must be established as kBTU per square foot-year of source energy use. This target must be mapped on the same scale as the baseline and proposed buildings, if the project follows Option 1.



        OPTION 1. Whole Building Energy Simulation

        Analyze a minimum of at least nine efficiency measures during the design process and account for the results in design decision-making.
Analysis can include energy simulation of efficiency opportunities, application of past energy simulation analyses for similar projects to the project, or application of published data from energy analyses performed for similar projects to the project (such as AEDGs).



        A minimum of six energy efficiency measures focused on load reduction strategies appropriate for the facility must be analyzed. This analysis must be performed during the schematic design phase.



        A minimum of three energy efficiency measures focused on HVAC related strategies must be analyzed (passive measures are acceptable). This analysis must be performed before the conclusion of the design development phase.



        The results of the analysis must be summarized in a brief report or memorandum.





        The next version of LEED will be going out for public comment again in July, I think, so please comment formally as well as discussing here.

        OK, Carol..now you threw the "bait" out there..older than dirt, eh?



        I have done very limited LEED "type" modeling where you compare 20 walls and 40 windows types (well, it seemed that way). Correct me if I am wrong, but a Base model must be built to comply with a certain level of ASHRAE 90.1 (now up to 2010 ??). With all of the nuisances of eQuest 3.64, I am going to build the model from scrathc and put in all the relevant baseline data in by hand.  And, by the way, the ASHRAE baseline model might be an entirely different system.  I am just completing an EPACT evaluation (ASHRAE
90.1-2001) and the Baseline HVAC was screwe chillers, whereas the Actual building was packaged units with Turbocor compressors (ask me how I did that).



        It very much depends on the complexity of the building. A 40,000 sf office or a 500,000 sf hotel with casino facilites.



        I am unfamiliar with the LEED paperwork to be filled out after the modeling has been done. But I would not do anything of this type in under 120 hours, preferably 160 hours. If the client thinks he can do better, let him.



        Contingency, contingency.



        We won't discuss how old CAROL might be..

        Marcus,

        You have inadvertently hit upon why IBPSA worked with ASHRAE to create a BEMP certification. That's Building Energy Modeling Professional (BEMP).

        Some of us who have been in the field for awhile began to worry a couple of years ago when so many new energy modelers began appearing on the listserv with questions. Their questions indicated a lack of training and experience that was worrisome. What made it worrisome was that they didn't seem to realize that they were as inexperienced as they were; they didn't appear to be pursuing training to learn how to do what they were doing; and we were uncertain as to how or if they were practicing quality control. We hoped that by creating a path to certification that we would give clients one more qualification to look for in their modelers.

        If you have been in this industry for any length of time, and by industry I mean the overall construction industry, you know that you don't get a lot of chances if your work doesn't pan out. If your energy model says I have a LEED Gold building and I'm going to save $4,000/year and what I really get is LEED Silver and $1,000/year, I am not going to be happy. So, I will probably not give you any more work but, even worse for all of us, I'll start expressing doubts about the whole process. LEED - what is it good for?

        So, now we all have more training, right? We read our ASHRAE Handbooks and technical manuals so we know how to model the difficult stuff.
We can find any topic in the DOE2 Manuals, all of which are one line, available, and easily searchable.

        So now we are so good we can do these models in 40-80 hours. Really?
Not me and I've been doing it longer than everyone, except you, John Aulbach.
So I'm going to join Marcus in his rant because he's on to something.

        It's up to us to not under bid this work. It's up to us to educate our clients about the importance of quality in this process. If they think they are getting the same analysis in 40 hours that they used to get in 120 hours, they need to be led around to rethinking that and to be reminded that GIGO.

        Cheers,

        Carol

                In our experience a final model, done right, would take about
80 hours.



                WARNING ? frustrated modeling rant to follow:



                Doing just a final model however completely misses the point as to why we model ? it is to guide design decisions!



                If I saw this RFP and all it asked me for was a model to determine LEED points, during or after design, I would try to educate the potential client about the purpose of modeling.



                Unfortunately too many projects pursuing LEED are only doing the minimum when it comes to modeling and almost completely missing all the benefits.  Too often the ?market? transforms only based on a least first cost denominator basis that results in little real transformation.  Doing models to determine LEED points does not transform the market, save any energy, and just circumvents the purpose behind LEED. (the next version actually requires design phase modeling!)



                Any ?modeler? who does only final models without attempting to explain to the owner why this is a bad idea should be ?drummed out of the corp? in my humble opinion.



                The problem is that if you respond to this RFP with 120 or
160 or more hours to really do the design phase modeling right, you will go up against the ?modeler? who claims to be able to do it in far less time.  So how do we get the folks who issue the RFPs to ask for a proper scope of work so that they can compare fees on a level playing field?  It is unfortunate that we are even having a discussion about doing modeling work in opposition to its purpose.



                Sorry for the rant but I feel better now. J

                I would expect, for a building this size, approximately 40 hours (multiply by your hourly rate). The 40 hours include EAp2/EAc1 LEED documentation, and any review you may have to respond to later.



                Now, given that you have never done a LEED model, it will take you more time, possibly up to 40 more hours.

                Greetings everyone,



                I have a question regarding the cost of an energy model for a LEED project. Every energy model I've done so far has been for

                existing buildings, mainly for optimization purposes.
However, I received an RFP to model a five-story, 41,500 sq. ft. building

                that's currently on the design phase and is pursuing the LEED-NC Silver certification. I really have no idea what would be a fair

                price for this model since I'm going to have to use Appendix G (ASHRAE 90.1) to evaluate the difference between the base

                and proposed buildings. I don't know how much extra effort this will take. I know the procedure, just haven't done it before.



                Can you shed any light on this issue?



                Thanks in advance!

Hello all,

 

I was wondering if anyone has had experience with the LEED M&V credit, specifically on New Construction? I looked back on old discussions about this and basically it came down to reading over the IPMVP Volume 3 Option D. However, I feel the language in the document is vague and wondered if any of you out there have successfully completed the credit for LEED and what the process is to "calibrate an energy model".

 

Are we talking about ensuring that the control system on the project can generate data on the follow:

 

?         Weather Data

?         Schedules

o    Occupancy

o    Equipment

o    Lighting

o    Temperatures

?         Equipment operating curves

?         Utility bill rates

 

Other than the information above, I'm having a hard time understanding what else you can modify on an energy model to try to reflect what is actually happening post occupancy. (at least from an eQuest standpoint).

 

Any suggestions? Thanks!

Hi ?mer,

  EnergyPlus has an module called airflow network, that works wich pressure
nodes and ventillation pathways. It`s not a CFD but for the purpose you will
use I think its even more appropriated than a CFD software. You can learn
more about at: http://fsec.ucf.edu/en/publications/pdf/FSEC-PF-428-07.pdf

Also, ASHRAE Guideline 14 covers Measurement and Verification as well.  I have heard from others that they setup M&V plans based on a combination of ASHRAE Guideline 14 and IPMVP, where IPMVP specifies the broader goals and ASHRAE Guideline 14 specifies the specific methods.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED Measurement & Verification Credits

 

Hello all,

 

I was wondering if anyone has had experience with the LEED M&V credit, specifically on New Construction? I looked back on old discussions about this and basically it came down to reading over the IPMVP Volume 3 Option D. However, I feel the language in the document is vague and wondered if any of you out there have successfully completed the credit for LEED and what the process is to "calibrate an energy model".

 

Are we talking about ensuring that the control system on the project can generate data on the follow:

 

?         Weather Data

?         Schedules

o    Occupancy

o    Equipment

o    Lighting

o    Temperatures

?         Equipment operating curves

?         Utility bill rates

 

Other than the information above, I'm having a hard time understanding what else you can modify on an energy model to try to reflect what is actually happening post occupancy. (at least from an eQuest standpoint).

 

Any suggestions? Thanks!

Considering that the NREL benchmark buildings generally under-predict when

necessarily be very useful.

The 50% Savings Advanced Energy Design Guide for K-12 School Buildings 
(publication this fall, free download available from 
www.ashrae.org/freeaedg) will include a chapter on EUI targets for schools. 
This chapter provides a methodology for determining targets for your 
specific project and provides targets (by end use and climate zone) for 
reference. The EUI targets that are provided were generated from energy 
simulations using the DOE reference building schools. A draft of the chapter 
can be downloaded from ftp://aedgpub:3a$ts!d3 at ftp.ashrae.org. The chapter is 
provided in DRAFT form and electronic dissemination is limited to Bldg-Sim 
mailing list members only. This file may not be stored on a computer system 
for the purpose of additional distribution. A physical copy may be printed 
from the electronic file only for the personal use of the Bldg-Sim mailing 
list member. The electronic file will be available through June 30 on the 
FTP site.

A procedure similar to what Chris outlined will be added to the chapter 
before publication (it is not currently in the draft). It will discuss a way 
to set your own energy target based on a project specific energy model. In 
summary, the steps will be as follows: (1) start with the appropriate DOE 
reference building school, (2) modify the model to include your schedules 
and climate information, (3) add specialty space types or unique plug loads 
that are not captured in the DOE model, and (4) run a simulation in your 
climate to set your own baseline. Your target is 50% of this EUI.

Any feedback to the draft or this procedure would be very helpful.

All:

I've been intrigued ever since I saw RMI's presentation on how target EUI's 
were set for the showcase Empire State Building renovation - where an 
innovative approach was used to define the building's "technical potential 
to achieve" and then measuring success by the team's ability to deliver a 
cost effective project than meets the "technical potential to achieve" as 
much as possible, while balancing all other needs.  Here's a nice summary - 
http://www.retrofitdepot.org/Content/Files/ESBCaseStudy.pdf

I've been thinking that, in general, re-framing energy performance success 
(i.e. EA C1 points) not as a "% better than an Appendix G Baseline" but to 
"% below the building's semi-unique technical potential to achieve" - might 
have interesting and positive effects.  By that I mean, imagine an office 
building designed and predicted to consume (on a site EUI basis) an EUI of 
89 kBtu/ft2, while the technical potential to achieve might have been 
determined to be 70 kBtu/ft2.   This represents a (1-(89/70)) = 27% gap, 
which say falls between 25% and 30% and it worth 3 EA C1 pts.

The ASHRAE Standard 100 Revision Committee has been working with some unique 
"hybrid" approaches combining "prototype or reference building energy 
models" and CBECS data to generate regional EUI targets based on building 
composition, building size, and building operating hours. The proposed 
revision of ASHRAE Standard 100 (not yet out for public comment) will 
incorporate a procedure for generating a building specific EUI for setting 
retrofit performance targets.  Here's a link to a presentation by Terry 
Sharp where he describes the basic concept under "Option 3" - 
http://tc76.org/docs/programs/ASRHAE%20std%20100%20%20Sem%2020102520June_Sharp.ppt 
Remember that EPA Target Finder is based exclusively on the EPA Portfolio 
Manager models, which are based on a number of different years of CBECS 
surveys, dependent on the space type.

It's not too much of a stretch to imagine, following the general principles 
from above and the methods described in proposed revision to Standard 100, 
to be able to generate a unique 'semi-custom' EUI for your building 
project - maybe it might look something like this:

1) Download appropriate DOE prototype model(s)
2) Add appropriate exterior shading (adjacent buildings, etc.)
3) Replace building fabric elements with appropriate benchmark elements for 
your building type (retrofit / new construction)
4) Replace 'asset' related elements (lights, equipment) with appropriate 
benchmark elements for your building type  (retrofit / new construction)
4) Generate site EUI results with a weather file for your location.
5) If necessary, combine (area weight) EUI to result in whole building 
"Potential to Achieve"

In this way, one ends up with a semi-custom EUI performance target to 
measure success against - a target could be "better defined" than what you 
can currently get from EAP Target Finder.   I can envision a consensus 
document which lays out a specifications and procedure for allowable 
alteration of the DOE models, in order to generate the "Potential to Achieve 
EUI", after which the % difference from an "As Designed" case translate to 
EA C1 points.  I know this is NOT the original purpose of the DOE Benchmark 
Buildings, but with careful thought, and community consensus, I think a 
process of something like this may move the centroid of the community in the 
right direction. The energy usage 'goal' would be known as soon as the 
program was set, and the design team can react from there.  Also, the 
resulting "As Designed" model could be more useful, at would be meant to 
represent actual building performance to the best of the knowledge of the 
design team.

Thoughts?

All the Best,

The primary purpose is to get the conversation started, early.  It is an 
opportunity to educate the owner and the team about energy.  In my 
experience the majority of designers can?t even tell you the metric for 
comparing building energy consumption.  I have often had this conversation 
early in the project design and have been met with blank stares.  It is 
incumbent upon us who do understand these energy issues to get the 
conversation started.
Caveat the heck out of the goal, explain the limitations, discuss the 
relative vs absolute metrics, be open about the issues ? so that we can 
raise awareness one conversation at a time.  This is the power of a market 
transformation tool like LEED.  It enables us to have these conversations.



I agree that both of these items are potential issues, talk to your clients 
about them.  If you don?t have a goal, how do you measure success?

While I conceptually agree with and understand the kbtu or watts/sf 
approach, to me, there seems to be some series issues with it in reality.

First, I don't agree that generating or coming up with appropriate target 
values during design is always (or even frequently) an easy thing to do or 
easy data to find.  It depends on your bldg type.  I do a lot of labs and 
hospitals.  Manufacturing and industrial use bldgs can have the same issues.
Good EUI data is not easy to come by for these bldg types - partly because 
the user equipment that is installed in them can be a big portion of the 
energy demand and consumption and it's always changing and can be very 
specific to each client.  For example: is it a community hosptial with more 
modest and generic care provide?....a state of the art hospital with 
specialized care functions?....does the lab have primarily biology or a 
chemistry functions....etc etc.  These things all affect the EUI.  In my 
opinion, the best resource for this data is actually utility companies based 
on data from similar customers, but that data is not generally publicly 
available and/or the population of similar comparable buildings may be small 
and difficult to relate to your bldg.

Second, quite frankly, in my opinion, DESIGN phase energy models are poor 
predictors of ACTUAL bldg energy use.  They are best at predicting RELATIVE
(comparative) energy use.  This is not because the tools are not good or 
inaccurate but because we and the owners are so poor at predicting how the 
bldg will actually be used, weather, etc.  One additional factor, is what 
equipment will actually be installed.  It's not uncommon for the technology 
to have changed bewteen the time that we start design and the time the 
equipment is actually purchased closer to the end of construction.  All 
these things effect not only the equipment w/sf usage but the ac w/sf usage 
etc.
So, there seems to me to be a serious disconnect to me if we talking about 
setting energy targets during DESIGNbased on statistical data of ACTUAL 
energy use and trying to use those figure during the design phase for 
predicted energy use.  Again, I love the idea but are we really there yet in 
reality.  It seems to me we need a lot more data that doesn't exist yet - 
and mechanism to collect that data.  (CBECS etc are good, but the population 
and variability for bldgs of these types has a long way to go).

I missing something about what's being proposed/talked about?

First of all the goal is not at all arbitrary but must be based on an 
expected outcome within a reasonable expectation.  It is informed by data 
from similar, actual building energy consumption.  I don?t think I need to 
explain the tools one can use to do this.



Your goal (do the best you can) sounds like, ?let?s build an energy 
efficient building?.  This is meaningless.  Energy efficiency in the context 
of new construction is always relative and without a quantification of what 
energy efficient means this is no goal at all.



Like any early stage performance goal the number is adjustable as more is 
discovered in the design process.  If the target is later discovered to be 
unreasonable due to a wide range of potential issues, then the target is 
adjusted.



If you pick your EUI goal the way you describe then yes this is a worthless 
goal but the key point is that it is never selected arbitrarily.

Not to be a jerk, but to ask an honest question: what is the point?  I?ve 
been involved with ?established energy target? projects and never really 
picked up on the logic behind it ? I would appreciate a layman?s 
explanation.



Put another way:  If you select an arbitrary EUI or watts per square foot at 
the earliest stages of design, what have you gained in design process?
If/when a project ?meets the goal? mid-design, are future design decisions 
supposed to de-emphasize energy impact (no!)?  If on the other hand, a 
project finds that target unreasonable down the road, what then?



Not setting a mile-marker like this implies designing the best building you 
can given the time/budget available and any other constraints? that seems 
more likely to result in the best end-result to me.



To draw analogy, if design of a LEED (or any energy-conscious) project is 
like planning a road trip from Kansas to Florida, setting EUI goals seems 
something like choosing a rest stop by throwing a dart at the map 
blindfolded.  It doesn?t help you get to your destination any more 
efficiently, it may be far out of the way, and now you?ve got a hole in the 
wall? what was the point?



Okay, maybe a weak analogy ? chalking it up to a very long week =).
Honestly, I?d appreciate someone laying the value behind this approach ? I?m 
expect the logic does exist, and I just haven?t yet seen the light!

Arpan,



Based on the Weidt Group paper, I?m guessing you?re emphasizing 
architectural considerations that affect the energy cost vs. LEED points 
numbers. (The paper uses window-to-wall ratios and daylighting as an 
example.) I would think the goal during the programming and schematic design 
phases should be energy cost, not LEED points relative to the App. G 
baseline. Much of the energy cost savings vs. App. G baseline (EAc1 points) 
is going to come later from the mechanical and lighting designs. The 
suggestions in the paper to establish specific baseline building shapes and 
glazing percentages would add a LOT more modeling time ? you?d have to 
create two separate building geometries for the baseline and proposed 
models, not to mention different zoning patterns, space types, lighting 
power per space etc.



For mechanical design, once the size and programming of the project is 
established, the baseline model properties are pretty well set, unless you 
consider fuel-switching and go between baseline systems 1/3/5/7 to systems 
2/4/6/8. One exception I can think of for a design decision that results in 
higher energy cost but better comparison with the App. G baseline is higher 
ventilation rates combined with heat recovery in the proposed and no heat 
recovery in the baseline.



Regards,

Bill

Marcus, thank you incorporating this language.



The one scenario we often see in our design guidance work is that a proposed 
design when compared with other design alternates does not necessarily 
provided the largest energy savings when compared against its own baseline 
case model. It is difficult to make a recommendation as consultants when we 
want to present the Owner with both real energy cost savings without 
compromising their LEED certification level targets.

        NC, CS, SCHOOLS, RETAIL, WAREHOUSE & DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, 
HOSPITALITY

        Establish an energy performance target no later than the schematic 
design phase. The target must be established as kBTU per square foot-year of 
source energy use. This target must be mapped on the same scale as the 
baseline and proposed buildings, if the project follows Option 1.



        OPTION 1. Whole Building Energy Simulation

        Analyze a minimum of at least nine efficiency measures during the 
design process and account for the results in design decision-making.
Analysis can include energy simulation of efficiency opportunities, 
application of past energy simulation analyses for similar projects to the 
project, or application of published data from energy analyses performed for 
similar projects to the project (such as AEDGs).



        A minimum of six energy efficiency measures focused on load 
reduction strategies appropriate for the facility must be analyzed. This 
analysis must be performed during the schematic design phase.



        A minimum of three energy efficiency measures focused on HVAC 
related strategies must be analyzed (passive measures are acceptable). This 
analysis must be performed before the conclusion of the design development 
phase.



        The results of the analysis must be summarized in a brief report or 
memorandum.





        The next version of LEED will be going out for public comment again 
in July, I think, so please comment formally as well as discussing here.

        OK, Carol..now you threw the "bait" out there..older than dirt, eh?



        I have done very limited LEED "type" modeling where you compare 20 
walls and 40 windows types (well, it seemed that way). Correct me if I am 
wrong, but a Base model must be built to comply with a certain level of 
ASHRAE 90.1 (now up to 2010 ??). With all of the nuisances of eQuest 3.64, I 
am going to build the model from scrathc and put in all the relevant 
baseline data in by hand.  And, by the way, the ASHRAE baseline model might 
be an entirely different system.  I am just completing an EPACT evaluation 
(ASHRAE
90.1-2001) and the Baseline HVAC was screwe chillers, whereas the Actual 
building was packaged units with Turbocor compressors (ask me how I did 
that).



        It very much depends on the complexity of the building. A 40,000 sf 
office or a 500,000 sf hotel with casino facilites.



        I am unfamiliar with the LEED paperwork to be filled out after the 
modeling has been done. But I would not do anything of this type in under 
120 hours, preferably 160 hours. If the client thinks he can do better, let 
him.



        Contingency, contingency.



        We won't discuss how old CAROL might be..



        John A.

        Marcus,

        You have inadvertently hit upon why IBPSA worked with ASHRAE to 
create a BEMP certification. That's Building Energy Modeling Professional 
(BEMP).

        Some of us who have been in the field for awhile began to worry a 
couple of years ago when so many new energy modelers began appearing on the 
listserv with questions. Their questions indicated a lack of training and 
experience that was worrisome. What made it worrisome was that they didn't 
seem to realize that they were as inexperienced as they were; they didn't 
appear to be pursuing training to learn how to do what they were doing; and 
we were uncertain as to how or if they were practicing quality control. We 
hoped that by creating a path to certification that we would give clients 
one more qualification to look for in their modelers.

        If you have been in this industry for any length of time, and by 
industry I mean the overall construction industry, you know that you don't 
get a lot of chances if your work doesn't pan out. If your energy model says 
I have a LEED Gold building and I'm going to save $4,000/year and what I 
really get is LEED Silver and $1,000/year, I am not going to be happy. So, I 
will probably not give you any more work but, even worse for all of us, I'll 
start expressing doubts about the whole process. LEED - what is it good for?

        So, now we all have more training, right? We read our ASHRAE 
Handbooks and technical manuals so we know how to model the difficult stuff.
We can find any topic in the DOE2 Manuals, all of which are one line, 
available, and easily searchable.

        So now we are so good we can do these models in 40-80 hours. Really?
Not me and I've been doing it longer than everyone, except you, John 
Aulbach.
So I'm going to join Marcus in his rant because he's on to something.

        It's up to us to not under bid this work. It's up to us to educate 
our clients about the importance of quality in this process. If they think 
they are getting the same analysis in 40 hours that they used to get in 120 
hours, they need to be led around to rethinking that and to be reminded that 
GIGO.

        Cheers,

        Carol

                WARNING ? frustrated modeling rant to follow:



                Doing just a final model however completely misses the point 
as to why we model ? it is to guide design decisions!



                If I saw this RFP and all it asked me for was a model to 
determine LEED points, during or after design, I would try to educate the 
potential client about the purpose of modeling.



                Unfortunately too many projects pursuing LEED are only doing 
the minimum when it comes to modeling and almost completely missing all the 
benefits.  Too often the ?market? transforms only based on a least first 
cost denominator basis that results in little real transformation.  Doing 
models to determine LEED points does not transform the market, save any 
energy, and just circumvents the purpose behind LEED. (the next version 
actually requires design phase modeling!)



                Any ?modeler? who does only final models without attempting 
to explain to the owner why this is a bad idea should be ?drummed out of the 
corp? in my humble opinion.



                The problem is that if you respond to this RFP with 120 or
160 or more hours to really do the design phase modeling right, you will go 
up against the ?modeler? who claims to be able to do it in far less time. 
So how do we get the folks who issue the RFPs to ask for a proper scope of 
work so that they can compare fees on a level playing field?  It is 
unfortunate that we are even having a discussion about doing modeling work 
in opposition to its purpose.



                Sorry for the rant but I feel better now. J

                Omar,



                I would expect, for a building this size, approximately 40 
hours (multiply by your hourly rate). The 40 hours include EAp2/EAc1 LEED 
documentation, and any review you may have to respond to later.



                Now, given that you have never done a LEED model, it will 
take you more time, possibly up to 40 more hours.

                Greetings everyone,



                I have a question regarding the cost of an energy model for 
a LEED project. Every energy model I've done so far has been for

                existing buildings, mainly for optimization purposes.
However, I received an RFP to model a five-story, 41,500 sq. ft. building

                that's currently on the design phase and is pursuing the 
LEED-NC Silver certification. I really have no idea what would be a fair

                price for this model since I'm going to have to use Appendix 
G (ASHRAE 90.1) to evaluate the difference between the base

                and proposed buildings. I don't know how much extra effort 
this will take. I know the procedure, just haven't done it before.



                Can you shed any light on this issue?



                Thanks in advance!

This may be something to represent in the LEED language if EUI is being
introduced, how a national CBECS average of 90 kBtuh/SF = 80 k/S actual
building, 70 k/S per 2004 model and est. 60 k/S per 2007 models.

The DOE Reference Building models (i.e. NREL benchmark models) were generated as starting points for research oriented simulations.  They were not developed to match CBECS performance data.  However, the reference building models do provide a good starting point for energy studies on specific buildings. The key is to modify them to your specific application with the correct schedules, special loads, etc.  From our experience with new and retrofit projects, modified reference building models do provide good EUI targets for projects.

Considering that the NREL benchmark buildings generally under-predict when
compared with CBECs, EUI targets generated from those models wouldn't
necessarily be very useful.

The 50% Savings Advanced Energy Design Guide for K-12 School Buildings
(publication this fall, free download available from
www.ashrae.org/freeaedg) will include a chapter on EUI targets for schools.
This chapter provides a methodology for determining targets for your
specific project and provides targets (by end use and climate zone) for
reference. The EUI targets that are provided were generated from energy
simulations using the DOE reference building schools. A draft of the chapter
can be downloaded from ftp://aedgpub:3a$ts!d3 at ftp.ashrae.org. The chapter is
provided in DRAFT form and electronic dissemination is limited to Bldg-Sim
mailing list members only. This file may not be stored on a computer system
for the purpose of additional distribution. A physical copy may be printed
from the electronic file only for the personal use of the Bldg-Sim mailing
list member. The electronic file will be available through June 30 on the
FTP site.

A procedure similar to what Chris outlined will be added to the chapter
before publication (it is not currently in the draft). It will discuss a way
to set your own energy target based on a project specific energy model. In
summary, the steps will be as follows: (1) start with the appropriate DOE
reference building school, (2) modify the model to include your schedules
and climate information, (3) add specialty space types or unique plug loads
that are not captured in the DOE model, and (4) run a simulation in your
climate to set your own baseline. Your target is 50% of this EUI.

Any feedback to the draft or this procedure would be very helpful.

All:

I've been intrigued ever since I saw RMI's presentation on how target EUI's
were set for the showcase Empire State Building renovation - where an
innovative approach was used to define the building's "technical potential
to achieve" and then measuring success by the team's ability to deliver a
cost effective project than meets the "technical potential to achieve" as
much as possible, while balancing all other needs.  Here's a nice summary -
http://www.retrofitdepot.org/Content/Files/ESBCaseStudy.pdf

I've been thinking that, in general, re-framing energy performance success
(i.e. EA C1 points) not as a "% better than an Appendix G Baseline" but to
"% below the building's semi-unique technical potential to achieve" - might
have interesting and positive effects.  By that I mean, imagine an office
building designed and predicted to consume (on a site EUI basis) an EUI of
89 kBtu/ft2, while the technical potential to achieve might have been
determined to be 70 kBtu/ft2.   This represents a (1-(89/70)) = 27% gap,
which say falls between 25% and 30% and it worth 3 EA C1 pts.

The ASHRAE Standard 100 Revision Committee has been working with some unique
"hybrid" approaches combining "prototype or reference building energy
models" and CBECS data to generate regional EUI targets based on building
composition, building size, and building operating hours. The proposed
revision of ASHRAE Standard 100 (not yet out for public comment) will
incorporate a procedure for generating a building specific EUI for setting
retrofit performance targets.  Here's a link to a presentation by Terry
Sharp where he describes the basic concept under "Option 3" -
http://tc76.org/docs/programs/ASRHAE%20std%20100%20%20Sem%2020102520June_Sharp.ppt
Remember that EPA Target Finder is based exclusively on the EPA Portfolio
Manager models, which are based on a number of different years of CBECS
surveys, dependent on the space type.

It's not too much of a stretch to imagine, following the general principles
from above and the methods described in proposed revision to Standard 100,
to be able to generate a unique 'semi-custom' EUI for your building
project - maybe it might look something like this:

1) Download appropriate DOE prototype model(s)
2) Add appropriate exterior shading (adjacent buildings, etc.)
3) Replace building fabric elements with appropriate benchmark elements for
your building type (retrofit / new construction)
4) Replace 'asset' related elements (lights, equipment) with appropriate
benchmark elements for your building type  (retrofit / new construction)
4) Generate site EUI results with a weather file for your location.
5) If necessary, combine (area weight) EUI to result in whole building
"Potential to Achieve"

In this way, one ends up with a semi-custom EUI performance target to
measure success against - a target could be "better defined" than what you
can currently get from EAP Target Finder.   I can envision a consensus
document which lays out a specifications and procedure for allowable
alteration of the DOE models, in order to generate the "Potential to Achieve
EUI", after which the % difference from an "As Designed" case translate to
EA C1 points.  I know this is NOT the original purpose of the DOE Benchmark
Buildings, but with careful thought, and community consensus, I think a
process of something like this may move the centroid of the community in the
right direction. The energy usage 'goal' would be known as soon as the
program was set, and the design team can react from there.  Also, the
resulting "As Designed" model could be more useful, at would be meant to
represent actual building performance to the best of the knowledge of the
design team.

Thoughts?

All the Best,

The primary purpose is to get the conversation started, early.  It is an
opportunity to educate the owner and the team about energy.  In my
experience the majority of designers can?t even tell you the metric for
comparing building energy consumption.  I have often had this conversation
early in the project design and have been met with blank stares.  It is
incumbent upon us who do understand these energy issues to get the
conversation started.
Caveat the heck out of the goal, explain the limitations, discuss the
relative vs absolute metrics, be open about the issues ? so that we can
raise awareness one conversation at a time.  This is the power of a market
transformation tool like LEED.  It enables us to have these conversations.



I agree that both of these items are potential issues, talk to your clients
about them.  If you don?t have a goal, how do you measure success?

While I conceptually agree with and understand the kbtu or watts/sf
approach, to me, there seems to be some series issues with it in reality.

First, I don't agree that generating or coming up with appropriate target
values during design is always (or even frequently) an easy thing to do or
easy data to find.  It depends on your bldg type.  I do a lot of labs and
hospitals.  Manufacturing and industrial use bldgs can have the same issues.
Good EUI data is not easy to come by for these bldg types - partly because
the user equipment that is installed in them can be a big portion of the
energy demand and consumption and it's always changing and can be very
specific to each client.  For example: is it a community hosptial with more
modest and generic care provide?....a state of the art hospital with
specialized care functions?....does the lab have primarily biology or a
chemistry functions....etc etc.  These things all affect the EUI.  In my
opinion, the best resource for this data is actually utility companies based
on data from similar customers, but that data is not generally publicly
available and/or the population of similar comparable buildings may be small
and difficult to relate to your bldg.

Second, quite frankly, in my opinion, DESIGN phase energy models are poor
predictors of ACTUAL bldg energy use.  They are best at predicting RELATIVE
(comparative) energy use.  This is not because the tools are not good or
inaccurate but because we and the owners are so poor at predicting how the
bldg will actually be used, weather, etc.  One additional factor, is what
equipment will actually be installed.  It's not uncommon for the technology
to have changed bewteen the time that we start design and the time the
equipment is actually purchased closer to the end of construction.  All
these things effect not only the equipment w/sf usage but the ac w/sf usage
etc.
So, there seems to me to be a serious disconnect to me if we talking about
setting energy targets during DESIGNbased on statistical data of ACTUAL
energy use and trying to use those figure during the design phase for
predicted energy use.  Again, I love the idea but are we really there yet in
reality.  It seems to me we need a lot more data that doesn't exist yet -
and mechanism to collect that data.  (CBECS etc are good, but the population
and variability for bldgs of these types has a long way to go).

I missing something about what's being proposed/talked about?

First of all the goal is not at all arbitrary but must be based on an
expected outcome within a reasonable expectation.  It is informed by data
from similar, actual building energy consumption.  I don?t think I need to
explain the tools one can use to do this.



Your goal (do the best you can) sounds like, ?let?s build an energy
efficient building?.  This is meaningless.  Energy efficiency in the context
of new construction is always relative and without a quantification of what
energy efficient means this is no goal at all.



Like any early stage performance goal the number is adjustable as more is
discovered in the design process.  If the target is later discovered to be
unreasonable due to a wide range of potential issues, then the target is
adjusted.



If you pick your EUI goal the way you describe then yes this is a worthless
goal but the key point is that it is never selected arbitrarily.

Not to be a jerk, but to ask an honest question: what is the point?  I?ve
been involved with ?established energy target? projects and never really
picked up on the logic behind it ? I would appreciate a layman?s
explanation.



Put another way:  If you select an arbitrary EUI or watts per square foot at
the earliest stages of design, what have you gained in design process?
If/when a project ?meets the goal? mid-design, are future design decisions
supposed to de-emphasize energy impact (no!)?  If on the other hand, a
project finds that target unreasonable down the road, what then?



Not setting a mile-marker like this implies designing the best building you
can given the time/budget available and any other constraints? that seems
more likely to result in the best end-result to me.



To draw analogy, if design of a LEED (or any energy-conscious) project is
like planning a road trip from Kansas to Florida, setting EUI goals seems
something like choosing a rest stop by throwing a dart at the map
blindfolded.  It doesn?t help you get to your destination any more
efficiently, it may be far out of the way, and now you?ve got a hole in the
wall? what was the point?



Okay, maybe a weak analogy ? chalking it up to a very long week =).
Honestly, I?d appreciate someone laying the value behind this approach ? I?m
expect the logic does exist, and I just haven?t yet seen the light!

Arpan,



Based on the Weidt Group paper, I?m guessing you?re emphasizing
architectural considerations that affect the energy cost vs. LEED points
numbers. (The paper uses window-to-wall ratios and daylighting as an
example.) I would think the goal during the programming and schematic design
phases should be energy cost, not LEED points relative to the App. G
baseline. Much of the energy cost savings vs. App. G baseline (EAc1 points)
is going to come later from the mechanical and lighting designs. The
suggestions in the paper to establish specific baseline building shapes and
glazing percentages would add a LOT more modeling time ? you?d have to
create two separate building geometries for the baseline and proposed
models, not to mention different zoning patterns, space types, lighting
power per space etc.



For mechanical design, once the size and programming of the project is
established, the baseline model properties are pretty well set, unless you
consider fuel-switching and go between baseline systems 1/3/5/7 to systems
2/4/6/8. One exception I can think of for a design decision that results in
higher energy cost but better comparison with the App. G baseline is higher
ventilation rates combined with heat recovery in the proposed and no heat
recovery in the baseline.



Regards,

Bill

Marcus, thank you incorporating this language.



The one scenario we often see in our design guidance work is that a proposed
design when compared with other design alternates does not necessarily
provided the largest energy savings when compared against its own baseline
case model. It is difficult to make a recommendation as consultants when we
want to present the Owner with both real energy cost savings without
compromising their LEED certification level targets.

        Analyze a minimum of at least nine efficiency measures during the
design process and account for the results in design decision-making.
Analysis can include energy simulation of efficiency opportunities,
application of past energy simulation analyses for similar projects to the
project, or application of published data from energy analyses performed for
similar projects to the project (such as AEDGs).



        A minimum of six energy efficiency measures focused on load
reduction strategies appropriate for the facility must be analyzed. This
analysis must be performed during the schematic design phase.



        A minimum of three energy efficiency measures focused on HVAC
related strategies must be analyzed (passive measures are acceptable). This
analysis must be performed before the conclusion of the design development
phase.



        The results of the analysis must be summarized in a brief report or
memorandum.





        The next version of LEED will be going out for public comment again
in July, I think, so please comment formally as well as discussing here.

        OK, Carol..now you threw the "bait" out there..older than dirt, eh?



        I have done very limited LEED "type" modeling where you compare 20
walls and 40 windows types (well, it seemed that way). Correct me if I am
wrong, but a Base model must be built to comply with a certain level of
ASHRAE 90.1 (now up to 2010 ??). With all of the nuisances of eQuest 3.64, I
am going to build the model from scrathc and put in all the relevant
baseline data in by hand.  And, by the way, the ASHRAE baseline model might
be an entirely different system.  I am just completing an EPACT evaluation
(ASHRAE
90.1-2001) and the Baseline HVAC was screwe chillers, whereas the Actual
building was packaged units with Turbocor compressors (ask me how I did
that).



        It very much depends on the complexity of the building. A 40,000 sf
office or a 500,000 sf hotel with casino facilites.



        I am unfamiliar with the LEED paperwork to be filled out after the
modeling has been done. But I would not do anything of this type in under
120 hours, preferably 160 hours. If the client thinks he can do better, let
him.



        Contingency, contingency.



        We won't discuss how old CAROL might be..

        Marcus,

        You have inadvertently hit upon why IBPSA worked with ASHRAE to
create a BEMP certification. That's Building Energy Modeling Professional
(BEMP).

        Some of us who have been in the field for awhile began to worry a
couple of years ago when so many new energy modelers began appearing on the
listserv with questions. Their questions indicated a lack of training and
experience that was worrisome. What made it worrisome was that they didn't
seem to realize that they were as inexperienced as they were; they didn't
appear to be pursuing training to learn how to do what they were doing; and
we were uncertain as to how or if they were practicing quality control. We
hoped that by creating a path to certification that we would give clients
one more qualification to look for in their modelers.

        If you have been in this industry for any length of time, and by
industry I mean the overall construction industry, you know that you don't
get a lot of chances if your work doesn't pan out. If your energy model says
I have a LEED Gold building and I'm going to save $4,000/year and what I
really get is LEED Silver and $1,000/year, I am not going to be happy. So, I
will probably not give you any more work but, even worse for all of us, I'll
start expressing doubts about the whole process. LEED - what is it good for?

        So, now we all have more training, right? We read our ASHRAE
Handbooks and technical manuals so we know how to model the difficult stuff.
We can find any topic in the DOE2 Manuals, all of which are one line,
available, and easily searchable.

        So now we are so good we can do these models in 40-80 hours. Really?
Not me and I've been doing it longer than everyone, except you, John
Aulbach.
So I'm going to join Marcus in his rant because he's on to something.

        It's up to us to not under bid this work. It's up to us to educate
our clients about the importance of quality in this process. If they think
they are getting the same analysis in 40 hours that they used to get in 120
hours, they need to be led around to rethinking that and to be reminded that
GIGO.

        Cheers,

        Carol

                WARNING ? frustrated modeling rant to follow:



                Doing just a final model however completely misses the point
as to why we model ? it is to guide design decisions!



                If I saw this RFP and all it asked me for was a model to
determine LEED points, during or after design, I would try to educate the
potential client about the purpose of modeling.



                Unfortunately too many projects pursuing LEED are only doing
the minimum when it comes to modeling and almost completely missing all the
benefits.  Too often the ?market? transforms only based on a least first
cost denominator basis that results in little real transformation.  Doing
models to determine LEED points does not transform the market, save any
energy, and just circumvents the purpose behind LEED. (the next version
actually requires design phase modeling!)



                Any ?modeler? who does only final models without attempting
to explain to the owner why this is a bad idea should be ?drummed out of the
corp? in my humble opinion.



                The problem is that if you respond to this RFP with 120 or
160 or more hours to really do the design phase modeling right, you will go
up against the ?modeler? who claims to be able to do it in far less time.
So how do we get the folks who issue the RFPs to ask for a proper scope of
work so that they can compare fees on a level playing field?  It is
unfortunate that we are even having a discussion about doing modeling work
in opposition to its purpose.



                Sorry for the rant but I feel better now. J

                Omar,



                I would expect, for a building this size, approximately 40
hours (multiply by your hourly rate). The 40 hours include EAp2/EAc1 LEED
documentation, and any review you may have to respond to later.



                Now, given that you have never done a LEED model, it will
take you more time, possibly up to 40 more hours.

                Greetings everyone,



                I have a question regarding the cost of an energy model for
a LEED project. Every energy model I've done so far has been for

                existing buildings, mainly for optimization purposes.
However, I received an RFP to model a five-story, 41,500 sq. ft. building

                that's currently on the design phase and is pursuing the
LEED-NC Silver certification. I really have no idea what would be a fair

                price for this model since I'm going to have to use Appendix
G (ASHRAE 90.1) to evaluate the difference between the base

                and proposed buildings. I don't know how much extra effort
this will take. I know the procedure, just haven't done it before.



                Can you shed any light on this issue?



                Thanks in advance!

Circling back to Omer's question. Even though IES and EnergyPlus provide
better representations of the type of building physics he is trying to
simulate, what are some examples of eQUEST approximations? What about a
combination of stacked zones with Sherman-Grimsrud OA parameters set up?
Since comfort throughout the space is not being analyzed, only energy
approximations.

Hi Martin,

Can you please explain a little more what do you mean by "good result"?
I suppose you must have been benchmarked the result with another model?

Chinfook

Hey David,

 

EnergyPlus is foreign to me right now, but if I'm correct in understanding DesignBuilder will export the DOE benchmark models into Sketchup, then the answer is definitely yes.  There is a procedure I've documented to move from Sketchup ? AGI32, and I use it fairly often for photometric/rendering studies.  I've written on this a while back and more recently in the AGI32 forums... (http://www.agi32.com/forums/view_topic.php?id=864&forum_id=4).

 

Some simplification may be in order once you're in Sketchup to make the transition into AGI32 cleanly.

 

I have reason to believe the most recent AGI32 update (2.1?) resolves much of the coplanar triangulation I've learned to work around / live with, which could potentially eliminate some/all of the intermediate CAD processing steps (region/union).  I've seen screenshots elsewhere that looked promising.

Not DesignBuilder (that I know of) but OpenStudio will import the IDF 
file and make SketchUp Entities.  Then, you might be able to use a 
Sketchup plugin to do the rest.

You can get OpenStudio from the EnergyPlus website:

That sounds about right... Openstudio is probably what I had in mind!  

 

Check out the following video around the 1-minute mark:

That is probably a preferable workflow to get to AGI32, since it would
process the geometry one less time.

I'm posting to the BLDG SIM list today, hoping there are users out there
simulating microclimates! In past projects I have seen the research tool
ENVI-met used to simulate microclimates. Is anyone familiar with
commercially available or more user friendly tools for this purpose? Here is
what I am hoping to analyze:

   - Atmosphere - Wind, Temperature
   - Soil System - Water Bodies
   - Vegetation - Vapor, Foliage Temperature
   - Surfaces - Heat Transfer; Walls, Roofs, Ground
   - Outdoor Street and Plaza Comfort - PMV values

Subject: [Bldg-sim] PTHP Baseline outperforming VAV
Message-ID: <BANLkTik7F64ryhd16NksAoc=nd4WHZwK+w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Having some difficulty in an App. G model for a 6-floor 14,000 m2 GFA Hotel
in zone 1B (Abu Dhabi). Assuming standard design for each, should a proposed
VAV system out-perform window AC units (the baseline)?

Proposed:
VAV with 2 Air-cooled centrifugal chillers, chiller COP = 3.1 (2.8 if
condenser fan energy included)
Envelope - Better windows decrease heating demand by 8% rest of envelope is
minimum required for compliance

Baseline:
System Packaged terminal heat pump, COP = 3.52

Using Energyplus v6.0 the results are;

Site Energy in End Uses                  BL   Proposed   COP5
                                         MWh     MWh     MWh

                     Fans - Interior     42.2   137.7   137.7

                   Interior Lighting    530.5   530.5   530.5

                   Total Site Energy   1467.9  1926.6  1590.2

I have the energy for the baseline, the proposed with COP = 3.1, and then
trying COP = 5. It seems that even if we drastically increase the COP of the
chiller plant in the proposed VAV system, we still can't get any energy
savings. Is this realistic, an artifact of the simulation, or just an error
on my part?

Any guidance would be appreciated,

Marcus

Dear Marcus,

.         It seems that your Baseline system, at >5 floors, should be VAV
with a chiller instead of a heat pump (using LEED 2009).

.         As modeled, your baseline DOES have a notably higher COP, so it
may well use less energy.  Part load performance will have a significant
effect, so you may want to check and compare  those curves.

.         Also check pump  delta T and total pressure drop.  If you continue
with a non-chiller system, pump energy is  a significant factor.  If your
Baseline becomes a chiller system, pump energy will probably become similar.

.         Check fan total pressure drop for each system since your fan power
is significantly larger in the Proposed system.

.         In the US, it is common to apply occupancy sensors on a LEED
project and ASHRAE 90.1 allows a 10% power reduction when these are used.
You are not taking advantage of that and may want to do so.

Hi Marcus,

Also pay attention to better glass in the proposed design. In a
cooling-dominated building, better window means the heat can not easily
escape from the building. You will not easily get credit from improving your
window here.

Cheney

Message-ID: <20110524021935.XTZZS.124303.root@cdptpa-web25-z01>

Hi all,

Is it possible to use EnergyPlus to model a walk-in cooler or freezer?  I have tried but regardless of the temperature setpoint I choose for the freezer, the modeled temperature does not want to drop below about 42 F.    

Also, has anyone made a model of a cooler that accurately estimates electricity loads?  I was able to model a cooler with a 45 F setpoint but I was way under the electricity consumption estimates I found for coolers/freezers on the web.  I think my problem was the large amount of electrical usage for non-compressor loads ? defrost cycle, evaporator fan, condenser fan, etc.

Dear All, 
 
I was asked to perform building simulation to attain LEED platinum.
 
Since I am not familiar with the LEED certification other than building simulation itself,
 
I'd like to know the relations between 1)LEED EA prerequisite/credits, 2)ASHRAE Audit, and 3)ASHRAE commissioning guideline.
 
Any related answers will be much appreciated.
 
Thank you.

Hi Marcus,

 

I agree with your selection of PTHP for the baseline, since your project
is a hotel, which is specifically listed in the notes to Table G3.1.1A
as being a residential building type.

I am not surprised that you are showing an energy penalty versus an
ASHRAE 90.1 PTHP - the cooling and fan energy is relatively low for
those units.

 

As James said, make sure you are accurately modeling your fan and
pumping energy in the proposed system. Unfortunately, there are no
pressure drop adjustment allowances for Systems 1 & 2.

The maximum allowable SHGC (0.25) is already pretty low for Abu Dhabi,
so your "better windows" might not have a lower SHGC than the value
required for the baseline, and you will not get a solar load reduction
in the proposed model.

 

Since your baseline cooling efficiency is dependent on the system
capacities, make sure you are not using too large of a baseline cooling
COP. (It should actually be calculated separately for each baseline
system.) Using the efficiency equation from Table 6.8.1D, assuming 400
cfm/ton air flow rate and removing the fan power energy from the
efficiency, I calculate COP = 2.94 for a 15,000 Btu/hr unit (for
example). There is a separate heating COP but your heating load is
negligible per your report below.

 

Regards,

Bill

Hi Marcus, 

 

Also pay attention to better glass in the proposed design. In a
cooling-dominated building, better window means the heat can not easily
escape from the building. You will not easily get credit from improving
your window here.

Hi all, 

Having some difficulty in an App. G model for a 6-floor 14,000 m2 GFA
Hotel in zone 1B (Abu Dhabi). Assuming standard design for each, should
a proposed VAV system out-perform window AC units (the baseline)? 

Proposed: 
VAV with 2 Air-cooled centrifugal chillers, chiller COP = 3.1 (2.8 if
condenser fan energy included)
Envelope - Better windows decrease heating demand by 8% rest of envelope
is minimum required for compliance

Baseline: 
System Packaged terminal heat pump, COP = 3.52

Using Energyplus v6.0 the results are;

Site Energy in End Uses                  BL   Proposed   COP5

                     Fans - Interior     42.2   137.7   137.7

                   Interior Lighting    530.5   530.5   530.5 
                   Exterior Lighting      0.0     0.0     0.0 
               Service Water Heating      0.0     0.0     0.0

I have the energy for the baseline, the proposed with COP = 3.1, and
then trying COP = 5. It seems that even if we drastically increase the
COP of the chiller plant in the proposed VAV system, we still can't get
any energy savings. Is this realistic, an artifact of the simulation, or
just an error on my part? 

Any guidance would be appreciated, 

Marcus

Message-ID: <88DC4C3C646DD5119B0D0002A537FD6818B3985B@madison.corp.epstein-isi.com>

Hey all,

 

I'm about to begin a LEED energy model for a warehouse project that contains a very large process load. It will be a major renovation project. The building will be broken out as 50,000 sq ft office and 300,000 sq ft warehouse. The anticipated HVAC systems on the project are package rooftop units with DX cooling/gas heating for both the office and warehouse areas. The warehouse space requires cooling and heating.

 

Two issues that come to light:

 

1.       Large Process Load

a.       Anticipated process load will consume roughly 40-60% of the buildings annual energy consumption. The Exceptional calculation method has been considered. However, the process being done at this facility is extraordinary and there is not a "baseline" to compare savings off of.

2.       Baseline System

a.       Based on the size of the warehouse, System 7 will be modeled. This system is a packaged rooftop VAV with reheat with chilled water and hot water boiler system. Based on previous experience and preliminary modeling results, the baseline system will be more energy efficient than the package rooftop units with DX cooling/gas heating. There's been a suggestion by our team to request a LEED Interpretation and to possible change the baseline system to also packaged rooftop units with DX cooling/gas heating as that is typically designed for warehouse type facilities.

 

Based on these two issues, I am having a hard time foreseeing this project being able to hit the minimum 5% savings requirement on major renovations. I searched the LEED Interpretations database but didn't find one that dealt with a project that had both these issues.

 

Any suggestions?

Marcus,
Compared to packaged DX equipment, an air cooled chiller has two fundamental efficiency disadvantages: extra heat transfer approach and the pumping energy of the water.

Load reductions always help, but to hone in a comparison of the efficiencies of these mechanical systems, I also suggest you look closely at:

-          the COP values and their corresponding rated ambient temperatures in the referenced standards and on your equipment literature

-          compressor types, sizing, and curves

-          maybe, thermal storage

Good luck,

Hi William,
We did a Leed warehouse herre in Canada but it 
was version NC 1.0, your 2.2 version.
In that case process energy has to be remove for comparaison with baseline.
We aslo can reclaim up to 2 credit in process 
energy i.e. heat recovery from refrigeration.
If it is Leed 2009 than you have to include 
process energy in baseline and proposed.

Hope this help

Martin

Hi William, 
We did a Leed warehouse herre in Canada but it was version NC 1.0, your 2.2 version.
In that case process energy has to be remove for comparaison with baseline.
We aslo can reclaim up to 2 credit in process energy i.e. heat recovery from refrigeration.
If it is Leed 2009 than you have to include process energy in baseline and proposed.

Hope this help

Hey all,
 
I'm about to begin a LEED energy model for a warehouse project that contains a very large process load. It will be a major renovation project. The building will be broken out as 50,000 sq ft office and 300,000 sq ft warehouse. The anticipated HVAC systems on the project are package rooftop units with DX cooling/gas heating for both the office and warehouse areas. The warehouse space requires cooling and heating.
 
Two issues that come to light:
 
1.       Large Process Load
a.       Anticipated process load will consume roughly 40-60% of the buildings annual energy consumption. The Exceptional calculation method has been considered. However, the process being done at this facility is extraordinary and there is not a "baseline" to compare savings off of.
2.       Baseline System
a.       Based on the size of the warehouse, System 7 will be modeled. This system is a packaged rooftop VAV with reheat with chilled water and hot water boiler system. Based on previous experience and preliminary modeling results, the baseline system will be more energy efficient than the package rooftop units with DX cooling/gas heating. There's been a suggestion by our team to request a LEED Interpretation and to possible change the baseline system to also packaged rooftop units with DX cooling/gas heating as that is typically designed for warehouse type facilities.
 
Based on these two issues, I am having a hard time foreseeing this project being able to hit the minimum 5% savings requirement on major renovations. I searched the LEED Interpretations database but didn't find one that dealt with a project that had both these issues.
 
Any suggestions?

Hi Arpan,

I ever used Envi-met for my research purpose before. It was the sole tool
which was able to correlate the impacts of plants and outdoor climate by the
time. Personally I believe it is a good tool and easy to pick up:
Pros:
- It is free
- You will get technical support easily if you join its mailing group
- It is able to cover your areas except for PMV values (I am not very sure
whether it is able to generate PMV values in the latest version). I guess
post-process calculation is necessary provided you have established outdoor
or semi-outdoor thermal comfort models.

Cons:
- A Little bit time consuming since it is sort of CFD calculation
- The vegetation database is from Germany. Let's say you are going to
analyze an outdoor environment in a tropical country, you probably need to
pay attention to this issue. Personally I do not think the database can be
directly applied to all climate conditions.

I only know Energy+ has a rooftop garden module and it may be able to do
similar calculation. Unfortunately, I have no experience in that area.
Anyone who knows Energy+ well can comment?

 Regards,

Cheney

Hi William,

The "large process load" issue has been discussed extensively. Basically,
the process loads are not allowed to be omitted from baseline and proposed
design models. For your case, without touching the process loads, you
probably have little chance to claim energy credit even you are allowed to
modify the baseline. The possible solution will be the Process loads itself.
See whether you are able to claim savings due to the introducition of high
efficient equipments. Bear in mind, reduction of energy use in process loads
is allowed as long as it is well documented with a comparison between market
standard equipments (baseline) and energy-efficient ones (proposed design).
By searching this forum or online, you will be able to find more info on
this subject.

Regards,

Cheney

I guess that's the only possible route we can take. What possible options do we have if we cannot document a market standard equipment design? Their process is very unique and there are only a couple firms that do the process this firm does. 

 

I agree, even if we can get the baseline system variance to be approved, it will insignificant since the process load takes up the majority of the energy consumption.

Hi William, 

 

The "large process load" issue has been discussed extensively. Basically, the process loads are not allowed to be omitted from baseline and proposed design models. For your case, without touching the process loads, you probably have little chance to claim energy credit even you are allowed to modify the baseline. The possible solution will be the Process loads itself. See whether you are able to claim savings due to the introducition of high efficient equipments. Bear in mind, reduction of energy use in process loads is allowed as long as it is well documented with a comparison between market standard equipments (baseline) and energy-efficient ones (proposed design). By searching this forum or online, you will be able to find more info on this subject.  

 

Regards, 

 

Cheney

Hi William, 
We did a Leed warehouse herre in Canada but it was version NC 1.0, your 2.2 version.
In that case process energy has to be remove for comparaison with baseline.
We aslo can reclaim up to 2 credit in process energy i.e. heat recovery from refrigeration.
If it is Leed 2009 than you have to include process energy in baseline and proposed.

Hope this help

Martin

Hey all,
 
I'm about to begin a LEED energy model for a warehouse project that contains a very large process load. It will be a major renovation project. The building will be broken out as 50,000 sq ft office and 300,000 sq ft warehouse. The anticipated HVAC systems on the project are package rooftop units with DX cooling/gas heating for both the office and warehouse areas. The warehouse space requires cooling and heating.
 
Two issues that come to light:
 
1.       Large Process Load
a.       Anticipated process load will consume roughly 40-60% of the buildings annual energy consumption. The Exceptional calculation method has been considered. However, the process being done at this facility is extraordinary and there is not a "baseline" to compare savings off of.
2.       Baseline System
a.       Based on the size of the warehouse, System 7 will be modeled. This system is a packaged rooftop VAV with reheat with chilled water and hot water boiler system. Based on previous experience and preliminary modeling results, the baseline system will be more energy efficient than the package rooftop units with DX cooling/gas heating. There's been a suggestion by our team to request a LEED Interpretation and to possible change the baseline system to also packaged rooftop units with DX cooling/gas heating as that is typically designed for warehouse type facilities.
 
Based on these two issues, I am having a hard time foreseeing this project being able to hit the minimum 5% savings requirement on major renovations. I searched the LEED Interpretations database but didn't find one that dealt with a project that had both these issues.
 
Any suggestions?

Strange. Check your schedules. You might also be overcooling ...

Ultimately, lower your heating setpoint to a very low value.

Dear All,
 
I'm simulating a building with an absorption chiller with EnergyPlus.
The chiller uses district heating as its source. 
I used HVACTemplate to create an electric chiller and then replaced it with an absorption chiller object,
and the simulation ran successfully.
 
But I'm not sure whether the absorption chiller was successfully implemented and it takes district heating
as its source. 
 
If any of you have any idea regarding this issue, please help me.
I've already tried to reach E+ help desk a few weeks ago, but the reply has not come.
 
Thank you.

HOT2000 is a free residential energy analysis tool used in Canada and
developed by CanmetENERGY at Natural Resources Canada.  It is used by
building practitioners, energy analysts and within federal and
provincial energy conservation programs.
 
A next generation version of HOT2000, coined "HOT3000" is in beta
testing and replaces the monthly bin engine used in HOT2000 with the
ESP-r engine.  HOT3000 also offers a 3D viewer for verifying geometry.

Deepika,

In Texas, you can use the IC3 software to check code compliance. This is a web-based software that requires no previous knowledge of simulation. This free software can be found at "ic3.tamu.edu". It evaluates IECC 2001-2009 code compliance in Texas using DOE2.1e as the simulation engine for single family and multifamily residences. Documentation and RESNET test results  can be found on-line.

Hello
I am curious to know which modeling software do people use for Homes?
is it HEED ?
Thanks

HI all, thanks for the excellent feedback, just wanted to report back for
the archive;

Yes, since hotel is considered residential, I am applying PTHP.

In ASHRAE 90.1-2007 SI, table 6.8.1D, the COP equation is 3.60 - (.213 x
Cap/1000) where Capacity is in units of [kW]. This must be an error? Cap
units should be [W] or equation should be 3.60 - (.213 x Cap). Using this
equation, this limits the COP of a PTHP to between 3.15 for 2.1 kW units and
below and 2.66 for 4.4 kW and above (with COP inclusive of fan energy).
Thanks for drawing my attention back to this equation, this significantly
increases the Baseline cooling.

I agree, my pump and fan energy also needs to be correctly sized according
to pressure drop, I just used the defaults as a place-holder until detailed
design.

Generally the point of chilled water vs. Dx having no clear advantage is a
good one, chilled water introduces greater heat transfer approach as pointed
out and requires pump energy. However, we have learned that the client is
actually only using VAV in certain zones, the guest rooms will be served by
zone terminal variable flow chilled water coils (fancoils) and AHU's with
enthalpy recovery. Unfortunately modeling this system is proving quite
challenging in EnergyPlus so I don't have any updated results yet.

Sincere thanks again for the comments!

Cheers,

Marcus

Kurt,

We had this problem before in the mid-80s simulating an ice rink at a Rec Center. This was published in an ASHRAE Transactions paper. We basically got around the issue by fudging the "U x A x Delta-T"...in this case fiddling with either the U or the A to adjust for the Delta-T. Results worked well against metered data.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Walk-in Coolers/Freezers

Hi all,

Is it possible to use EnergyPlus to model a walk-in cooler or freezer?  I have tried but regardless of the temperature setpoint I choose for the freezer, the modeled temperature does not want to drop below about 42 F.

Also, has anyone made a model of a cooler that accurately estimates electricity loads?  I was able to model a cooler with a 45 F setpoint but I was way under the electricity consumption estimates I found for coolers/freezers on the web.  I think my problem was the large amount of electrical usage for non-compressor loads ? defrost cycle, evaporator fan, condenser fan, etc.

Alex,

Sorry to take a little while to respond.  You are correct that the medium office reference building has a gas furnace and electric reheat.  We actually received some opposite industry feedback from what you heard.  We heard that installing gas at the terminal level (vs. on the roof at the RTU for the central furnace) for reheat wouldn't be done for a building of that size - that installing electric reheat would be simpler and, therefore, more common.  Same for hydronic reheat, especially if the central heating wasn't hydronic.  I'm curious if your colleague's answer would change depending on the size of the building.

This highlights one of the difficulties of creating one-size-fits-all reference buildings - there are a lot of different opinions out there!  That said, if there is a large consensus against having electric reheat in the medium office, we would consider changing it whenever any future modifications are released.  Unfortunately, I can't make any promises about a timeline for that right now.

Anyone else feel like chiming in for the most appropriate system type?  For your "reference," the medium office building is three stories and about 53,000 sf total.

Kristin

P.S. You're welcome, and I'm glad you've found the reference buildings to be a valuable resource.

Subject: Medium-Office HVAC question

Hello,

First- thanks for the reference buildings! They are a great resource.

I had a question about the HVAC system that is in both the 'Post 1980' and 'New 2004' Medium Office Reference building (IDFs attached). Does the HVAC system have a gas hook-up for the furnace (item coil:heating:gas) and then use electricity for the reheat (item coil:heating:electric)? I asked a colleague of mine about this, and he said "You would never build a job with gas available on-site and electric reheat, even in the 80s". My background is more on Building Envelope and also simulation/software more than it is in Mechanical Systems, so I don't know one way or the other. I was hoping that you could shed some light on the system that was selected.

We're hoping to use the system as a baseline to investigate window retrofits, and pick the HVAC system that we would most likely encounter in existing buildings. Any information you can provide would be much appreciated.

Thanks in advance,
Alex Krickx

All,

The U.S. DOE Commercial Reference Buildings have been updated to version 1.3_5.0 and posted on the following Website:

http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/commercial_initiative/reference_buildings.html

As with the previous release, there are 3 vintages of 16 different building types modeled in 16 U.S. climates (3 x 16 x 16 = 768).  Users can download:


*         All 768 EnergyPlus 5.0 input files (.idf format)

*         All 768 EnergyPlus table output files (.htm format)

*         All 48 "Scorecard" spreadsheets for each building type in each vintage, summarizing input and output details

*         Zip file of the 16 TMY2 weather files used (.epw format)

*         List of changes in models between versions 1.3_5.0 and 1.2_4.0

*         Table of EUIs [kBtu/sf/yr] for all models in each vintage

*         Archived versions of previous releases for above files

We appreciate all the valuable feedback we've received from users of these models.  Much of it has been incorporated into the changes between versions.

Regards,
Kristin Field

In my experience electric reheat is the norm some 
older building, before 1970, may have hydronic 
reheat but this is the case in Quebec, Canada.

I think it probably varies from location to location based on utility
rates for the different fuel sources.  In the PNW, with relatively cheap
electricity, most buildings have electric re-heat at the zone level if
they have VAV systems.  However, one thing that we found in our most
recent commercial baseline study was that most of the buildings in that
size range actually had packaged rooftop equipment with gas heat, rather
than VAV systems.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Medium-Office HVAC question

 

Alex,

 

Sorry to take a little while to respond.  You are correct that the medium
office reference building has a gas furnace and electric reheat.  We
actually received some opposite industry feedback from what you heard.  We
heard that installing gas at the terminal level (vs. on the roof at the
RTU for the central furnace) for reheat wouldn't be done for a building of
that size - that installing electric reheat would be simpler and,
therefore, more common.  Same for hydronic reheat, especially if the
central heating wasn't hydronic.  I'm curious if your colleague's answer
would change depending on the size of the building.

 

This highlights one of the difficulties of creating one-size-fits-all
reference buildings - there are a lot of different opinions out there!
That said, if there is a large consensus against having electric reheat in
the medium office, we would consider changing it whenever any future
modifications are released.  Unfortunately, I can't make any promises
about a timeline for that right now.

 

Anyone else feel like chiming in for the most appropriate system type?
For your "reference," the medium office building is three stories and
about 53,000 sf total.

 

Kristin

 

P.S. You're welcome, and I'm glad you've found the reference buildings to
be a valuable resource.

Subject: Medium-Office HVAC question

 

Hello,

 

First- thanks for the reference buildings! They are a great resource.

 

I had a question about the HVAC system that is in both the 'Post 1980' and
'New 2004' Medium Office Reference building (IDFs attached). Does the HVAC
system have a gas hook-up for the furnace (item coil:heating:gas) and then
use electricity for the reheat (item coil:heating:electric)? I asked a
colleague of mine about this, and he said "You would never build a job
with gas available on-site and electric reheat, even in the 80s". My
background is more on Building Envelope and also simulation/software more
than it is in Mechanical Systems, so I don't know one way or the other. I
was hoping that you could shed some light on the system that was selected.

 

We're hoping to use the system as a baseline to investigate window
retrofits, and pick the HVAC system that we would most likely encounter in
existing buildings. Any information you can provide would be much
appreciated.

 

Thanks in advance,

Alex Krickx

Hi John!

 

Here's some thoughts generally following your queries for everyone's
benefit.  

 

Keep in mind that for some of these questions - there are no black and
white answers, all you'll ever get is "what works for me."  I expect
others will concur & courteously differ with me on at least a few points
=).

 

1.       If sticks are analogous to the bare minimum required by 90.1,
then make a Mona Lisa with sticks =).  LEED models are at once both
difficult and simple - there are many rules and procedures to follow,
but the degree of accuracy expected of the final product is not nearly
so rigorous as historically calibrated models and similar.  It's a whole
different ball game.  I've written much on how LEED models are not
"predictive models" (nor should they be).  Be very clear with yourself
and your colleagues/clientele on that point, or else be prepared to
spend an extra few magnitudes of time on the project.

2.       As a general rule:  scheduling can be as simple or complex as
you like, provided baseline & proposed models are treated identically.
Some exceptions exist where the scheduling can/should differ (common
example in my models: exterior lighting controls).  Start "simple,"
(work with the default libraries/curves), then add detail to the models
as is necessary.  For example: one weighted plug load schedule for the
entire building is in many cases absolutely fine, but you may find it
necessary to break things out further to demonstrate actual equipment
performance in your proposed model (such as in an IT room with a
mini-split) - refine schedules as you need to along the way, and just
make sure the baseline receives the same refinements as you go.

3.       Define custom equipment performance curves as is necessary to
get credit where it's due, or where it's known/expected your software's
library curves do not cut it for that system type.  Library curves are
themselves totally acceptable provided they're a reasonable
approximation.  Be prepared to document and create custom curves however
should your reviewer ask for it, particularly if you are using equipment
known to require custom curves to be modeled correctly.

4.       Restroom exhaust:  depends on the software you're using, where
the air is coming from, and the answers can vary for both proposed and
baseline models... G.3.1.2.8. speaks to relief systems if that's what
you're getting at.

5.       Baseline infiltration: don't believe it's defined through
appendix G... but a very good question!  I know 90.1 addresses envelope
sealing to some extent but I don't think there's anything quantified for
the overall construction's leakage rate... I match proposed model levels
as practice, and haven't had the issue come up yet.  Would love to hear
if others have successfully documented something different for
baseline/proposed!

6.       Humidity control should be considered if it is in the actual
design.  90.1 requires humidity setpoints be kept the same between the
models, alongside thermostat setpoints somewhere in that big 2-column
table.

7.       Picking a "close" construction is something I used to do, until
I learned that actual constructions aren't really so hard to define
after all.  Either approach can be acceptable for LEED's rigor in my
experience, but as with anything it depends on the reviewer lottery
(some may not accept an approximation).  As a practice these days, I do
carefully define each layer for the envelope constructions, and make a
point to keep a photocopy of the referenced envelope construction
details in my project design file.  Makes for easy documentation later.

8.       Generally:  All baseline capacities
(airflows/gpms/heating/cooling) are auto-sized in the model in a "sizing
run"  - corresponding efficiencies for each are worked from those
quantities.  Refer to Appendix G (and the archives here) for specifics
;-).

 

General advice:

-          Trace-specific questions I can't help much with, but for any
modeler I'd advise reading Appendix G, then reading Appendix G again.
Appendix G pretty much sets the bar regarding what you must do
irrespective of the energy modeling software of choice.  It's pretty
prescriptive, and should be read that way.  Don't hesitate to refer to
earlier sections (incl. Appendix A) and give them a cursory review from
time to time as you try to better define baseline behavior for various
systems.

-          Anyone unfamiliar with submitting EAc1 for LEED v3 really
really really must log in, and download the EAp2 excel spreadsheet that
will be uploaded for documentation.  It would be a good idea to grab the
EAc1 template (pdf) while you're there.  Review the spreadsheet/template
carefully for your project before starting and periodically as you
develop your models... the excel spreadsheet is pretty much a one-stop
shop for what your reviewer will be looking at down the road, and can
help remind you of what needs attention along the way.  I consider
myself very familiar with 90.1, and still do this with every LEED
project.

-          The 2007 90.1 user's manual is a worthwhile text for those
intermediate to modeling under 90.1.  Get a few projects under your belt
first then you'll get  more out of it.

-          If you meet a fellow energy modeler in person it's totally
appropriate to buy him/her a beer.  Fist bumps are fine for some of the
population, but watch for a confused expression and be prepared to
gracefully transition into a handshake.

-          Don't wax your car in direct sunlight.

-          Water your lawn in the early AM.

-          Call your mother sometimes.

-          Real bikers wear spandex.

Classification: UNCLASSIFIED

Caveats: NONE

 

I am looking for training.

 

What I'd like to learn.

How detailed to models need to be for LEED?  Do I make a stick figure or
the

Mona Lisa

      Do I make one schedule for the building or one per room.

      Do I make unloading curves for the equipment or use the defaults.

      How is exhaust air from restrooms supposed to be handled.

      What is the baseline infiltration rate supposed to be.

      Does humidity need to be considered.

      Do I need to model the wall construction or can I pick something

close and type in the u-value

      What is the ft of heat for the baseline design if I use a boiler.

      

Not counting the rooms geometry there still seems to be over 500 (maybe
1000)

different values in Trace that can be adjusted.  Some large like the
type of

system to small like is it draw thru or blow thru (or the Outside long
wave

emissivity of the window which the architect still hasn't found for me).

 

I understand that when comparing different options (such as R value A or
B)

the detail doesn't need to be on the gnat's ass.  So energy modeling at
the

onset of a project isn't too hard to figure out. What is required for a
LEED

reviewer to get a warm fuzzy from my model is the big question I'd like
to

get training on.

 

The simple answer is to do it all, consider everything, but then reality
sets

in and I have a budget to consider.

Hi Kurt,

We model a refrigerated warehouse using ESPr and 
TRNSYS.  We did not try Energy+.
The main reason was to evaluate the effect of the 
thermal mass stored against the incoming product that was warmer.
when we compare our result to those of the 
refrigeration contractor there was a big 
difference.  Half of their calculated load
And compare to actual energy consumption, it was close.

So if you use energy+ be shure to include thermal mass.

Martin

If you are modeling a refrigerated you can also use ENERGYPRO, though you
have to buy the software.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Training (UNCLASSIFIED)

Classification: UNCLASSIFIED
Caveats: NONE

I am looking for training.

What I'd like to learn.
How detailed to models need to be for LEED?  Do I make a stick figure or the
Mona Lisa
	Do I make one schedule for the building or one per room.
	Do I make unloading curves for the equipment or use the defaults.
	How is exhaust air from restrooms supposed to be handled.
	What is the baseline infiltration rate supposed to be.
	Does humidity need to be considered.
	Do I need to model the wall construction or can I pick something
close and type in the u-value
	What is the ft of heat for the baseline design if I use a boiler.
	
Not counting the rooms geometry there still seems to be over 500 (maybe
1000)
different values in Trace that can be adjusted.  Some large like the type of
system to small like is it draw thru or blow thru (or the Outside long wave
emissivity of the window which the architect still hasn't found for me).

I understand that when comparing different options (such as R value A or B)
the detail doesn't need to be on the gnat's ass.  So energy modeling at the
onset of a project isn't too hard to figure out. What is required for a LEED
reviewer to get a warm fuzzy from my model is the big question I'd like to
get training on.

The simple answer is to do it all, consider everything, but then reality
sets
in and I have a budget to consider.

I have successfully modeled walk-in freezers for the upcoming Title 24 supermarket refrigeration code in E+. I used the explicit method which requires compressor racks. If you are using compressor rack objects make sure that you are choosing the right compressor and that the compressors can meet the load. The .err file will give a warning if the system cannot meet the refrigeration loads. 

FYI, The dataset folder in the E+ folder has several compressor curves.

I was able to model a cooler with a 45 F setpoint but I was way under the electricity consumption estimates I found for coolers/freezers on the web.  I think my problem was the large amount of electrical usage for non-compressor loads ? defrost cycle, evaporator fan, condenser fan, etc.

Message-ID: <DDC6CEED88CBED46868D11CF3A96EC8223FFBD7F@VA3DIAXVS1C1.RED001.local>

I am using EE4 to model an office building with natural gas RTU's but electric reheats at the zone level.   The reference building is only using natural gas for heating, rather than gas + electricity as in the proposed design.  I'm getting very nice energy savings overall, but since my electricity use for the proposed case is actually higher than that of the reference, the cost has not gone down much at all  (electricity is a lot more expensive here than natural gas.)

Is there any way to get EE4 to model the electric zone reheat capacity in its reference case?

I have the RTU's defined with electric zone reheat coils.

Thanks!

Hi  Alex,

 

Define your system as a 2 pipes fan coil (or 4 pipe if you also do zone
cooling ). The heating at the zone level will be handled by the hot water
coming from your plant boiler.  Define your plant boiler energy source as
electric.  The energy consumption for your zone heating coil should then be
electric for the proposed and reference building.

 

You can also look in the EE4 modelling guide for 2 or 4 pipes systems
operation.

 

Don?t hesitate if you have more questions.

 

Regards, 

 

Marc-Antoine Paquin, eng.

Review the section "Determination of Principal Heating Source" in the EE4 modelling guide.  Essentially you should use the fuel source with the highest energy source adjustment factor which contributes at least 10% to the total heating capacity of each zone (including both terminal and system capacity).  Since electricity has a higher ESAF than natural gas, if your electric reheat contributes at least 10%, then the principle source will be electric.

The heating source is entered at the zone level.

Hi Alex,

You can not modify reference case in EE4 but you can modify it in DOE.
Reference case is based on MNECB and to have a 
electric heat in the reference case, the propose 
building have to use electricity more than 50% for heating.

Martin

All,

I have a project with an UPS room (Uninterruptible Power System).  I was give
the full load heat rejection.  

As I understand the UPS system, it is a battery back-up in emergencies. So
the rest of the time the UPS would be in a trickle-charger type mode.  When I
model the UPS as being in full load heat 24hrs-365day if become a very large
percentage of my building.  

What can I assume for the tickle-charger mode?  (I'm going to assume
"Emergencies" happen so seldom that it isn't worth scheduleing. So my model
would have the UPS always in stand-bye mode.... you know, in an attempt to
reflect reality.)

Hey John,

All power passes through a charged UPS on a day-to-day
(nonemergency/standby) basis for protected equipment... and this has a
heat loss that's a % of what's drawn hour-to-hour.  Grab a cutsheet to
try and to find the efficiency figure:  

(From http://www.tekexcel.com/esteemating.htm)

"... the inefficiency or power loss of a UPS will be in the range of 2%
to 20% and this is the fraction of the input power that will be turned
into heat. The percent power loss of different types of UPS depends
primarily on the design topology and can be estimated using the
following guide:

Small Standby UPS 	3%
Line Interactive UPS 	4%
Double Conversion On-Line UPS 	15%
Delta Conversion On-Line UPS 	5% "

Bldg Sim Mailing List Member,

ASHRAE, AIA, IES, USGBC, and DOE have partnered to write a series of Advanced Energy Design Guides that provide energy savings over minimum building codes. The guides are intended to help those involved in designing or constructing the various building types to easily achieve advanced levels of energy savings without having to resort to detailed calculations or analyses. The guides contain specific recommendations by climate zone and how-to tips and approaches that provide additional information on how to implement those recommendations.

The latest in this series provides 50% savings over ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004 for Medium to Big Box Retail Buildings. These guides go through two targeted peer reviews during their development in order to ensure that the information is useful and applicable to those who would use the guides. Your expertise would be very much appreciated by the project committee and your input during these reviews would help ensure that the finished guide is both relevant and beneficial to the retail industry.

This is a notice of the first Peer Review for the Technical Review Draft of the Advanced Energy Design Guide for Medium to Big Box Retail Buildings (50% Savings). This peer review is now open and will be held from Tuesday, May 31, 2011 through Tuesday, June 14, 2011. The review input form and instructions along with a copy of the Technical Review Draft document will be available for download from the ASHRAE AEDG web page during that time period (see www.ashrae.org/aedg<http://www.ashrae.org/aedg> -- look halfway down the page under the green header labeled "Planned Guides<http://www.ashrae.org/technology/page/938#planned>"). We ask that you please use the input form for your feedback and send your responses to lpratt at ashrae.org<mailto:lpratt at ashrae.org>.

Thank you,
