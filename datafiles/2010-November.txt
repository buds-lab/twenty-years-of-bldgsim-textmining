Subject: [Bldg-sim] Exceptions to G3.1.1, and how you model them?
Message-ID: <4A015401026CF44ABCC4D2A6A467AA1863A8AB@EXCHANGE1.cadd_group.ghtltd.com>

I was interested to see if anyone would share how they model the
exception to G3.1.1 in ASHRAE 90.1-2007 (or 04).  This is the part that
says when you have a baseline building with system 5-8, you're supposed
to model system 3 or 4 for any spaces that "have occupancy or process
loads or schedules that differ significantly from the rest of the
building."  It goes on to say that basically the peak thermal loads must
differ by 10 Btu / h-ft2 or more from the average of the other spaces,
or that schedules must differ by more than 40 full load hours per week,
for this exception to apply.

 

I've had reviewers question certain rooms that I've put on separate
PSZ-AC systems, and so I've sort of defaulted to putting almost all
rooms on the main systems (5-8).   However, in looking at some of my
recent models, depending on interior loads and climate, the actual peak
cooling load on a square foot basis varies anywhere from 5-20 btu /
h-ft2 range for offices.  So this means there is a big difference
between those models with 5 btu / h-ft2 peak and those with 20.  For the
models with 5, almost every space in the building is going to be within
+/- 10 btu/h-ft2 of that average.  However, those buildings that average
around 20 will have many rooms that are < 10 btu/h-ft2 peak (ie any
internal space whose light + plug load density is < 3.0 W / sq ft).

 

To use a simple example as a question:  if your particular office
building averaged 20 btuh / h-ft2 peak cooling load, would you model a
separate PSZ-AC system for a core bathroom, whose peak cooling load is
only 3 btu/h-ft2?

 

There are lots of rooms where I question whether I should do a separate
PSZ-AC/HP system (storage rooms, stairs, mechanical rooms, lobbies,
etc).  I can see where these meet the 10 Btu/h-ft2 delta exception.  

 

So does everyone really model a bunch of PSZ-AC systems based
specifically on the average peak thermal loads of the building?

 

I'm thinking out loud, but if I had an office building that averaged on
the low side (5 Btu/h-ft2) for cooling peaks, it seems pretty easy to
have a perimeter conference room that exceeded 15 Btu / h-ft2 peak.
Seems like an exhaustive process to confirm this delta for every room in
a model to determine whether it needs its own system...

 

Sorry for the long email.  Thanks!

Hi James,

LEED CIR allows projects to demonstrate substantial energy savings for
well-designed HVAC system serving high process load spaces based on the
exception to G3.1.1. So the premise is "high occupancy or process load"
spaces, such as server rooms, natatoriums, before it comes to the benchmark
of 10 btu/h-ft2. Therefore, I guess your storage rooms, stairs, mechanical
rooms should not be modeled separately.

James,

I believe this is an unfortunate choice of the word "spaces" in Appendix G. I think the intent is really that if you have a zone with significantly different loads or schedules, it should not be placed on one of the VAV systems serving other portions of the building. If the spaces you are describing such as bathroom, stairs, or storage rooms are defined as their own thermal zone, they should not be combined in a VAV system with spaces very different loads or schedules, but rather have their own single zone system.  See Table G3.1 #s 7 and 8 for discussion regarding how to create thermal zones.

Mike

Hi James,


The CIR is dated on 3/23/2007. It clarifies use of exception to G.3.1.1. to
document baseline and achieve greater energy savings from single-zone
systems in *high* process load areas.

As per G3.1.1. in Appendix G (90.1-2004), my understanding is to use
separate single-zone system for any space has very high occupancy or process
loads or schedules that differ significantly from the rest of the
building. You can understand it in the opposite way that the rooms have
significantly less occupancy or process loads. But I guess the CIR points to
the high process load areas in order to achieve greater energy savings from
single-zone systems.

Regards,
Cheney

I see, that makes a little more sense.  So if I had a stairwell, which
does not have HIGHER process loads than the average space, and whose
occupancy schedule is basically the same as the rest of the office
space, then I would HAVE to have that stairwell on the base-building
System 5-8.   I couldn't have it on its own PSZ-AC. 

 

Mike, this goes against what you said in your email.  This is sort of
why I asked the question...there doesn't seem to be a consensus.  I
model stairwells, elevator shafts, bathrooms, etc as separate thermal
zones in all of my models, and if I read the letter of the code, it
would seem they need to be their own systems, yet the CIR sort of says
that this isn't the case, and reviewers agree, and don't like to see
rooms like this on separate systems.

Hi James, 

 

 

The CIR is dated on 3/23/2007. It clarifies use of exception to G.3.1.1.
to document baseline and achieve greater energy savings from single-zone
systems in high process load areas. 

 

As per G3.1.1. in Appendix G (90.1-2004), my understanding is to use
separate single-zone system for any space has very high occupancy or
process loads or schedules that differ significantly from the rest of
the building. You can understand it in the opposite way that the rooms
have significantly less occupancy or process loads. But I guess the CIR
points to the high process load areas in order to achieve greater energy
savings from single-zone systems.

Cheney

Thanks Cheney, but I'm not sure I follow your email.  I've already
determined that, for example, a core bathroom could easily have a peak

REQUIRE that I model these separately?

 

What CIR are you referencing?

Hi James, 

 

LEED CIR allows projects to demonstrate substantial energy savings for
well-designed HVAC system serving high process load spaces based on the
exception to G3.1.1. So the premise is "high occupancy or process load"
spaces, such as server rooms, natatoriums, before it comes to the
benchmark of 10 btu/h-ft2. Therefore, I guess your storage rooms,
stairs, mechanical rooms should not be modeled separately.

Cheney 

 

I guess your storage rooms, stairs, mechanical rooms, lobbies, etc.
should not be

I was interested to see if anyone would share how they model the
exception to G3.1.1 in ASHRAE 90.1-2007 (or 04).  This is the part that
says when you have a baseline building with system 5-8, you're supposed
to model system 3 or 4 for any spaces that "have occupancy or process
loads or schedules that differ significantly from the rest of the
building."  It goes on to say that basically the peak thermal loads must
differ by 10 Btu / h-ft2 or more from the average of the other spaces,
or that schedules must differ by more than 40 full load hours per week,
for this exception to apply.

 

I've had reviewers question certain rooms that I've put on separate
PSZ-AC systems, and so I've sort of defaulted to putting almost all
rooms on the main systems (5-8).   However, in looking at some of my
recent models, depending on interior loads and climate, the actual peak
cooling load on a square foot basis varies anywhere from 5-20 btu /
h-ft2 range for offices.  So this means there is a big difference
between those models with 5 btu / h-ft2 peak and those with 20.  For the
models with 5, almost every space in the building is going to be within
+/- 10 btu/h-ft2 of that average.  However, those buildings that average
around 20 will have many rooms that are < 10 btu/h-ft2 peak (ie any
internal space whose light + plug load density is < 3.0 W / sq ft).

 

To use a simple example as a question:  if your particular office
building averaged 20 btuh / h-ft2 peak cooling load, would you model a
separate PSZ-AC system for a core bathroom, whose peak cooling load is
only 3 btu/h-ft2?

 

There are lots of rooms where I question whether I should do a separate
PSZ-AC/HP system (storage rooms, stairs, mechanical rooms, lobbies,
etc).  I can see where these meet the 10 Btu/h-ft2 delta exception.  

 

So does everyone really model a bunch of PSZ-AC systems based
specifically on the average peak thermal loads of the building?

 

I'm thinking out loud, but if I had an office building that averaged on
the low side (5 Btu/h-ft2) for cooling peaks, it seems pretty easy to
have a perimeter conference room that exceeded 15 Btu / h-ft2 peak.
Seems like an exhaustive process to confirm this delta for every room in
a model to determine whether it needs its own system...

There are some good articles from the recent SimBuild conference about using
an external program to simulate daylighting control response, and then input
lighting schedules to eQuest (same process for HAP) based on those results:



 http://www.ibpsa.us/sb10pub.shtml



http://www.ibpsa.us/pub/simbuild2010/papers/SB10-DOC-TS06A-02-An.pdf

*Integrating advanced daylight analysis into building energy analysis*
J An, S Mason(paper<http://www.ibpsa.us/pub/simbuild2010/papers/SB10-DOC-TS06A-02-An.pdf>|
presentation)



I can?t say whether results from Solartube are the best resource to perform
a similar process, or if the consultant on your project should do the
external modeling.  (Well, okay if you twist my arm I suspect the consultant
should do it!  Or at least Solartube should provide some detailed
information about their process and tools.)



Same thing for PV ? you can probably come up with a pretty decent
exceptional calculation.



The cogen is a little different, as there is quite a bit of interaction
between thermal energy produced by the external calculation, and thermal
energy consumed within the HAP model, and the production may change
depending on the electrical demands, and the timing of the need for hot
water is important.



Passing electricity generation and consumption information back and forth
doesn?t have the same complexity that the thermal simulation will have.



Hope this helps!

Hi All,

I have a concern about using HAP for LEED project energy modeling. The
software provider stated that HAP does not model daylighting and we have 13
Solatubes in a 2000 SF buidling. They also said it doens't model PV and
co-gen, which we have both. A 1.2 kW PV system and a residential co-gen
system that produces electricity and hot water for our 2000 SF building as
well as some for other buidling aras on the small non-profit's campus.

I concerned that modeling the PV system and co-gen system externally and
just putting those numbers into HAP and having the solatube mfgr model the
solatubes and giving us some number to put into HAP will not yield the
"real" same reuslts as running an eQuest model for a true integrated energy
model.

Any comments? I haven't used eQuest or HAP myself and am trying to get
feedback from people that have who are not already part of the project's
paid design team.

Thank you very much for your effort in advance.

Regards,

Debra

Hi all,
 
I'd like to know how to solve error problems in EnergyPlus.
 
The error message goes like this: 
 
 
   ** Severe  ** AirLoopHVAC B1AE_FCU02_AN_EHP has no air flow
   **   ~~~   ** Check flow rate inputs for components in this air loop and,
   **   ~~~   ** if autosized, check Sizing:Zone and Sizing:System objects and related inputs.
 
 
 
I'm modeling a 5-story building with a complicated structure and this single error message is followed by 
 
170 other errors and warnings. I'm pretty sure i can ignore the rest as long as i solve the first one. 
 
I don't know how to explain a variety of conditions regarding the building. 
 
 
Anyway, if any of you has encountered similar errors, please help me.
 
I gotta meet the deadline, which is exactly 6 hours away from now.
 
Thank you.

Message-ID: <004901cb7c48$6bd1c430$43754c90$@com>

Hi,

 

As a novice in the modeling world I was confronted with the issue of
Perimeter Insulation behind steam radiators in New York City.  Many of the
older buildings had asbestos behind the steam radiators which later had to
be removed.   Recently, these perimeter insulations were replaced by rigid
insulation board.  One of our subcontractors modeled this newly added
perimeter insulation as a ? F decrease in room temperature (in eQuest).  

 

As this was not deemed satisfactory another approach was chosen: 

 

1.       Create new Global Parameter, Rad_Wall_UValue, set value at 0.209.

2.       In Radiator Steam Loop, Losses Tab, Supply UA, Edit/View User
Expression Input value is:  (5*3)*900*#PA("Rad_Wall_UValue") , where (5*3) =
insulation dimensions, 900 = insulation count.

3.       In parametric runs choose new Rad_Wall_UValue as 0.122. 

 

Any ideas for a different approach, since this overestimates the heating
costs. 

 

Walter Elyon.

Hi,
 
Has anyone here worked on energy modeling of a greenhouse building
(large-scale, 25+ acres) using eQUEST? 
 
If so, could you provide some pointers on what the important modeling
parameters are? It seems to be a very broad field of study involving
precise knowledge
of temp/humidity/co2/plant type/transpiration rates/plant ages etc., and
any guidance on how best to approach these will be greatly appreciated. 
Any papers or presentations related to this topic will be of help too.
 
Also, in case eQUEST is not the program of choice, could you suggest any
others that are worth investigating for this purpose?

*Subject:* [Bldg-sim] Rates for steam and electricty



Hey all,



I am trying to come up with the life cycle cost for a project. The building
has a steam boiler, a hot water boiler and a chiller. The boilers are oil
fired and chiller is air cooled. Could anyone give me the best estimates for
the rates which I can use for steam and electricity. (may be cost per kWh ,
and cost per therm) . I did try to look at EIA.DOE website but was not able
to find any useful data.



Thanks in advance. Appreciate any help.

Hello All!

When modeling heating and ventilation systems for MA-CHPS EE.P1, do you keep it the same between the proposed and baseline models?

Hi All,
 
If any of you has any kind of idf files concerning photovoltaic features, would you please share one?
 
I searched for it in the ExampleFiles folder, but couldn't find it.
 
I would really appreciate it if you hurry up a little bit.
 
Thanks.

Hi James,

I must chime in on this. First off, in reality I would more expect to see a
transfer grille above the door of the storage room, bathroom, etc., than I
would expect each to have their own system. I frequently model them as
unconditioned spaces attached to a HVAC system and call it good. Mostly if a
room of that type is conditioned, it is fed off the nearest system. Stairs
may be separately heated with a unit heater, which I would model in the
proposed case, but for the baseline I'd just stick to what makes
"engineering" sense following the spirit of the code.

Best,

Carol

Hi All,
 
 
I've been using E+ example files (GSHP-  series) in order to apply a geothermal system to my buildings.
 
I'm currently performing simulation for 8 buildings, and a problem was detected:
 
Small buildings worked just fine with the method I mentioned above, 
 
but larger ones didn't.
 
It seems that some changes should be made to the E+ example files before performing simulaton for larger buildings.
 
But unforetunately I cannot figure out what those changes might be.
 
Could you help me? plz plz plz

I've always interpreted the exceptions you mention as an alternative way in 
which special spaces MAY be modeled but don't HAVE to be modeled. 

My experience has been mostly with labs and hospitals which have pressurization 
requirements and thus typically meet one or more of the criteria for the 
exception to be used. 

LEED reviewers and CIRs have generally upheld the optional approach and allowed 
all the pressurized spaces to be put on the main systems since using individual 
separate units to model hospital rooms or labs is not in line with what could be 
done in reality.  

It may be helpful for you to take a look at the CIRs on the subject as related 
to application to labs and hospitals.  These could be rather enlightening 
regarding the "spirit" and application of the exception.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] fire station modeling
Message-ID: <4CD95462.2000405@gmail.com>

has anyone received a comment on eac1 requiring the use of residential 
ptac systems in the baseline building when modeling fire stations?  i 
have seen the following comments on two fire station projects recently 
with no further background material concerning the source of the 
residential determination from the reviewers than the statements below.  
this, to me, is not what previous usgbc cirs, 90.1 (2004 or 2007), or 
the 90.1 user's manual say.   per 90.1 and the previous usgbc cirs the 
predominant use of the building, based on sf and number of stories, 
determine what type of systems are used.  for a building less than 
20,000 sf this is typically going to be packaged gas or heat pump units.

project 1 (leed v2.2 project)
"The Baseline system type modeled does not seem consistent with the 
system mapping from Table G.3.1.1.A. Please note the GBCI has determined 
that Fire Stations are considered residential for the purposes of 
completing EAc1 credit.  Please confirm that the Baseline system (and 
principle heating source) was modeled correctly, or revise the system 
type to reflect ASHRAE modeling protocol. Also, if any exceptions are 
utilized from G3.1.1 please provide a explanation for the exception."

project 2 (leed v2.2 project)
"5. Table 1.4 indicates the Baseline Primary HVAC system as a type #3, 
which does not appear to be consistent with the system mapping from 
Table G.3.1.1.A. The sleeping quarters (residential) should be modeled 
as a system type #1 and the non-residential areas as a type #3. Please 
provide a narrative confirming that the Baseline model sleeping quarters 
have been modeled using System #1, Constant Volume PTAC, with DX 
cooling, and Fossil Fuel boiler. The narrative shall also include size 
of equipment modeled within the Baseline model. Revise Baseline Unitary 
Equipment Cooling and Boiler parameters to match Tables 6.8.1A and 
6.8.1E of ASHRAE 90.1-2004 and include Proposed Unitary Equipment 
Cooling and size of the boilers. Please revise the Baseline and Proposed 
models, and update the Template, and supporting documentation as 
required. Please confirm that the parameters defined in section G3.1.3.2 
through G3.1.2.5 have been modeled, and that the mandatory requirements 
of Section 6.4 have been adhered to. Please add sufficient information 
to Table 1.4 to confirm that the Baseline boiler systems were modeled in 
accordance with these requirements"

the usgbc cir & 90.1 references:

1.  USGBC Advanced Energy Modeling for LEED (page 17) - Table 2.2, CIR 
dated 8/26/2008 and 4/23/2008. "Clarifies how to determine baseline HVAC 
system(s) for building eligible for more than one system type."
-"CIR dated 8/26/2008 states that for projects with multiple uses in the 
same building, predominant condition as determined by total floor area 
should determine system type for entire building.  Ruling references 
note following Table G3.1.1A in ASHRAE 90.1-2004:  Where attributes make 
a building eligible for more than one baseline system type, use the 
predominant condition to determine the system type for the entire 
building."
-"CIR dated 4/23/2008 confirms that when conditions do not vary per 
exceptions to G3.1.1, project teams must use single baseline system type 
for entire building.  HOwever, if project includes multiple detached 
buildings, each building can use different system type; this is 
addressed in Chapter 4 of document."

2.  90.1-2004 Table G3.1.1A Note 3 - "Where attributes make a building 
eligible for more than one baseline system type, use the predominant 
condition to determine the system type for the entire building."

3.  90.1-2004 Section G3.1.1 Exception (a) - "Use additional system 
type(s) for non-predominant conditions (i.e. residential/nonresidential 
or heating source) if those conditions apply to more than 20,000 sf of 
conditioned floor area." (Note the fire stations in the two projects 
with the comments above are each less than 14,000 sf of conditioned 
floor area.)

4.  90.1-2004 User's Manual - "The scope of Standard 90.1, in terms of 
residential spaces, applies just to spaces with four or more stories, so 
low-rise residential is excluded."

That is a good point about the exception size of 20,000 ft2 for baseline
systems, and I think the USGBC and/or GBCI would be justified in issuing a
general clarification about how to specifically approach fire stations as
many of them are LEED registered based on municipal requirements, and they
very frequently will have this mixture of usage types and small conditioned
areas.  For fire stations, this isn't an exception, it is the rule!



My own LEED Gold fire station project was under v2.1, so I can?t help you
there.



The requirements for the Apparatus Bay spaces are so wildly different than
the residential areas that logically they should be separate systems,
regardless of the noted exceptions?these are clearly two different building
types, even if each is below the 20,000 ft2 individually.  Or even sometimes
in total!  And we haven?t even reached the ?office? spaces in the building
yet?



Also you may want to raise the issue on bldg-sim rather than equest-users,
as this could come up for users of all software packages?

I am doing EEM modeling, with both gas and electric effects on a multi family 
unit in Los Angeles.
?
One EEM is a lighting reduction. Another is weather stripping, which reduces 
infiltration.
?
I add up the EEMs individually and get a gas savings (negative from the lighting 
reduction obviously). I add them together in a COMBO run (where they 
interact)?and the gas savings goes UP !!
?
WHY !!!!

Because the air leaking in the windows in the base case was cold, presuming

Do you mean that the net gas savings got worse or better?  (Compared to when you summed the gas savings individually)

I guess it is because the lighting generates internal loads which will
benefit heating in winter. The reduction of lighting will reduce the
internal loads which is more predominant than the savings from infiltration.
Then you got higher gas requirement in your model.

If I understand you correctly, you ran both the lighting EEM and the weather stripping EEM separately.  In the lighting EEM, the gas savings got worse.  In the weather stripping EEM, the gas savings got better.

Then you manually added the two together, for a net gain of gas savings (the gas savings from the weather stripping more than compensated for the gas consumption increase from the lighting EEM).

But when you run the two simultaneously, you get a different savings number.  One that is better, for increased gas savings.  You're wondering why.

I'm pretty sure it's because when you improved the envelope, the gas increase from the lighting reduction is not as significant.  In your first run (individually) the gas increase from the lighting reduction is occurring within a lousy envelope.  In the simultaneous run, the gas increase from the lighting reduction is occurring within a good envelope building, so the increase is now not as drastic.  Make sense?

My guess is that lighting reduction EEM works only during day time and has hardly any or no effect during when the occupants are sleeping (obviously depends on the lighting schedules).

Infiltration (again depending on the schedules) works all throughout the day. And specially results in gas savings during night time when the outside air is cold. However, it does have some effect during day time as well.

It seems that in the combo case during the day time, the reduced OA (due to infiltration) is offsetting the penalty in the space heating due to reduced LPD.

To explain it further:

In the reduced infiltration case the savings in heating energy during the day time do not show up because the excessive Lighting is taking care of it.
However, in the Combo case the reduced infiltration shows even more savings and surpasses the penalty in heating energy due to reduced lighting because the OA load during the day time is larger than the penalty. And when the OA is reduced during the day time as well as the night time, larger savings are seen. Does that make sense?

i did post to bldg-sim as well.  haven't heard back from that list yet.  
also sent the usgbc a question thru their 'contact' us in the support 
section.  may or may not hear from there.   this is relatively recent, i 
think.  my previous fire stations under leed 2.2 were certified a year 
ago+ and this didn't come up.

if the argument for classifying them as residential is based solely on 
the definition of residential in chapter 3 (it does list fire stations) 
i would think that #4 below from the user's manual would still clarify 
that the residential space classification does not apply.

Under ASHRAE 90.1 1999 if the proposed building HVAC system includes a
radiant slab thoruhghout and trickle vents on the perimeter (containing
hot-water coils) should the baseline system also include these components
and not simply be specified according to the baseline system-type table?

Message-ID: <AANLkTimoNYmmUnCOb806Mho2=-zYCafk3cpH_ixCGE9-@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,

I trying to model chilled beams with VAV supply boxes in HAP, which till now
seems to be very difficult. HAP does not allow you to change your airlfows
from occupied to unoccupied modes. There are different 8ACHR/4ACHR
requirements for occ/unocc periods which I am not able to meet. As HAP
always calculates air flow based on the space loads; in occupied time, the
loads which are way less than 8 ACH, I have to force some additional air in
the spaces, but then I get the same air flow in unoccupied time also even if
the loads are scheduled to go off.

If anyone has tried doing this before in CARRIER HAP, please let me know.

Would really appreciate your help.

Message-ID: <426554.46951.qm@web113110.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hello All,

I would like to know how other increase their baseline capacity when they have 
unmet load. I have a PSZHP system?and in one system, I got more than?400 hrs 
unmet load. I usually just increase the TR cooling capacity until?I get a lower 
unmet load but in this case, I think?the unmet load is due to low supply cfm. Is 
it ok to adjust also the supply fan cfm??I am thinking that G3.1.2.2 only 
requires?me to adjust?only the cooling capacity. Do others adjust?both cfm and 
cooling load?

Thanks,

Jaigath

We are doing a project in a pretty cold climate. The project design has a really big glass fa?ade facing south. One of the ideas to reduce conductive heat loss is to create a double skin fa?ade on the south side.

Now I realize that this is going to take a fair amount of analysis work to design it properly. What I was wondering is if there is a quick analysis tool/methodology to tell if this is even feasible to go into more detailed analysis.

Any help would be much appreciated

Maybe modelling the cavity as sunspace might work - it will not take care of
the cavity ventilation part but will probably work for the solar radiation
part (not sure if sunspace allows for daylighting - you will have to check
on that.)
Another option would be to use EnergyPlus - I think it has an example file
for double facade.

Hi Vik,

 

I hate to trample over anyone's little flower patch, but I've read some scathing assessments of double-facades as an energy-saving strategy.  You might want to check this and the associated references out: http://www.buildingscience.com/documents/insights/bsi-007-prioritizing-green-it-s-the-energy-stupid.

 

That said you might not be satisfied until you develop your own conclusions.  Proponents of this approach repeatedly cite benefits of CFD, so to give a "fair/proper" assessment any tool you work with would probably need to be modeling convective airflows between floors.

 

~Nick

Nick and Vikram, double skin facades or climate walls or windows have been around for many years now. Vikram's question is really how do you produce a back of the envelope calculation to see if a double skin fa?ade is a viable option. Well here goes, the basic improvement by using a double fa?ade is the improvement of the U value decreasing energy loss. Take a look around the world and the successful applications of double facades is mostly in regions where heating is the dominant energy consumer. One of the first things were learnt more than 30 years ago was the U value was improved so long as air was ventilated through the cavity, but what happened to the U value when the air system was switched off after occupation? which consumed more energy, the energy loss of the building without the function of the double fa?ade or the energy consumption of the air system to maintain the functionality of the double fa?ade. Beyond the improvement of the U value we can then start looking at improved shading coefficients and surface temperature control of the inside surface of the double fa?ade. For these different aspects of double fa?ade design I believe the design criteria was simplified in a series of tables issued in a couple of ISSO publications in the 80's. These documents will get you rough data to be able to assess whether or not the double fa?ade is feasible. As far as deluxe simulation tools probably the best is the ROOM program by Mike Holmes and Andrew White and then there is also TRNSYS.

Getting back to Nick's comments, I have found over the years that the most comments regarding double facades come from people that have never designed them, here I am referring to the article and not you Nick.

I first started designing double facades in the late 70's in the Netherlands and over the years have designed quite few and completed quite a few repair jobs on attempted double facades. One thing I have learned is that if it isn't cold then the double fa?ade is there for show only!

Hi,

you may want to use one of the following two online tools:

http://www.bestfacade.com/textde/BestFacadeDSF_InternetTool/index.html

http://designadvisor.mit.edu/

Both should give you a good estimate with respect to energy, daylight and
comfort.

Good luck.

Another tool to use to analyze double fa?ade buildings is IESVE. You could
possibly pull it off during your free 30 day trial period.

Hi

Using En+ for DS may lead to unrealistic results. A student of mine made 
is MSc comparing En+ results to the monitoring results of a naturally 
ventilated DSF test cell and the air gap air temperature/ventilation 
flow was significantly out of reality (unfortunately it's in 
portuguese). Similar results obtained by Kim et all may be found at 
http://www.iaqvec2010.org .
You can check at IEA Annex 44 
(http://www.ecbcs.org/annexes/annex44.htm#p.) what is available and a 
set of pros and cons, but DSF is not an easy task to properly model.

Hi Matthias

How are you?

Do you really think so about bestafacade "model"? I think it's so over 
simplified that it becomes useless.

I was expecting you to advise the use of TRNSYS...

One of the most important issues on DSF (maybe the most important) is 
gap ventilation. So care should be taken into account when using sun 
space models.

Hi Peter

I think you are only considering DSF gap forced ventilation (/when the 
air system was switched off after occupation?/). This not an issue is 
it's naturally ventilated. My opinion, and I am not a designer but I've 
been monitoring a few occupied DSF fa?ades in the warm climate of 
Lisbon, is that as for any other building system it has to be properly 
designed having in mind location and use. I monitored really bad fa?ades 
but also fa?ades that behave quite well allowing the interior 
temperature to remain within comfort levels during weekends when HVAC is 
switched off.
I don't know ROOM but TRNSYS is a good option for modelling DSF (see the 
work of Haase et al).
I agree that cold climates are preferable when considering a DSF option, 
but there are other issues like, for example, tall and wind exposed 
fa?ades, specially if  glazzed, where inside shading is thermally a bad 
option and for outside positioning fast damage is certain. Anyway owners 
may allways impose a look for their building...

Rob,
 
Generally, I combine all the spaces served by a single VAV box into one
thermal zone for modeling purposes. The ASHRAE 90.1 User's Manual,
p.G-19 has reasonable guidance on defining "thermal blocks". Where HVAC
zones have been designed, zones can be combined into thermal blocks for
modeling purposes when all these conditions are met (paraphrasing here):
1.)     The spaces have the same load and schedule characteristics.
2.)     Exterior zones with glazing must have the same, or similar
orientation.
3.)     Zones must be served by the same HVAC system or by the same kind
of HVAC system.
 
Chances are that the zones/spaces served by a single VAV box will meet
these criteria in a properly designed HVAC system.

Bill

Peter, Marques et al:

 

Thank you so much for sharing your collective insights!  My initial comments were intended only to open the discussion, as I have heard contrarian opinions in the past and didn't want a friend to be unaware of them =).  Consider me an interested student, certainly not an authority on the subject!

 

I for one have been motivated by this discussion to do some homework, and now have a much better grasp of the fundamentals.  Apparently ASHRAE Journal put out a good primer roughly a year ago for others in the same boat of curiosity to understand the concepts and challenges present in DSF design better - I found this handy:  http://www.rwdi.com/cms/publications/76/200904_Ventilating_Facades.pdf

 

Thanks again,

 

~Nick

Hi Peter 

I think you are only considering DSF gap forced ventilation (when the air system was switched off after occupation?). This not an issue is it's naturally ventilated. My opinion, and I am not a designer but I've been monitoring a few occupied DSF fa?ades in the warm climate of Lisbon, is that as for any other building system it has to be properly designed having in mind location and use. I monitored really bad fa?ades but also fa?ades that behave quite well allowing the interior temperature to remain within comfort levels during weekends when HVAC is switched off.
I don't know ROOM but TRNSYS is a good option for modelling DSF (see the work of Haase et al).
I agree that cold climates are preferable when considering a DSF option, but there are other issues like, for example, tall and wind exposed fa?ades, specially if  glazzed, where inside shading is thermally a bad option and for outside positioning fast damage is certain. Anyway owners may allways impose a look for their building...



Nick and Vikram, double skin facades or climate walls or windows have been around for many years now. Vikram's question is really how do you produce a back of the envelope calculation to see if a double skin fa?ade is a viable option. Well here goes, the basic improvement by using a double fa?ade is the improvement of the U value decreasing energy loss. Take a look around the world and the successful applications of double facades is mostly in regions where heating is the dominant energy consumer. One of the first things were learnt more than 30 years ago was the U value was improved so long as air was ventilated through the cavity, but what happened to the U value when the air system was switched off after occupation? which consumed more energy, the energy loss of the building without the function of the double fa?ade or the energy consumption of the air system to maintain the functionality of the double fa?ade. Beyond the improvement of the U value we can then start looking at improved shading coefficients and surface temperature control of the inside surface of the double fa?ade. For these different aspects of double fa?ade design I believe the design criteria was simplified in a series of tables issued in a couple of ISSO publications in the 80's. These documents will get you rough data to be able to assess whether or not the double fa?ade is feasible. As far as deluxe simulation tools probably the best is the ROOM program by Mike Holmes and Andrew White and then there is also TRNSYS. 

Getting back to Nick's comments, I have found over the years that the most comments regarding double facades come from people that have never designed them, here I am referring to the article and not you Nick. 

I first started designing double facades in the late 70's in the Netherlands and over the years have designed quite few and completed quite a few repair jobs on attempted double facades. One thing I have learned is that if it isn't cold then the double fa?ade is there for show only!

Hi Vik, 

  

I hate to trample over anyone's little flower patch, but I've read some scathing assessments of double-facades as an energy-saving strategy.  You might want to check this and the associated references out: http://www.buildingscience.com/documents/insights/bsi-007-prioritizing-green-it-s-the-energy-stupid. 

  

That said you might not be satisfied until you develop your own conclusions.  Proponents of this approach repeatedly cite benefits of CFD, so to give a "fair/proper" assessment any tool you work with would probably need to be modeling convective airflows between floors.

We are doing a project in a pretty cold climate. The project design has a really big glass fa?ade facing south. One of the ideas to reduce conductive heat loss is to create a double skin fa?ade on the south side. 

  

Now I realize that this is going to take a fair amount of analysis work to design it properly. What I was wondering is if there is a quick analysis tool/methodology to tell if this is even feasible to go into more detailed analysis. 

  

Any help would be much appreciated

This is the approach i previously took.  i got review comments back and
wanted to double check to make sure before i resubmitted.

Vikram,
There is a number of tools that allow you to assess the DSF performance.

Simple, non commercial (freeware) tools you can use are WIS 3 (for steady state boundary conditions) and Parasol for dynamic calculations (tool also that implements - if I am not wrong - the 15099 standard).

As to dynamic thermal modelling tools you can use Energy Plus, or other commercially available tools; I have worked in the past with IDA ICE 3.0 (there is the newer version IDA ICE 4.0 available) that will allow you to assess DSF performance. In fact, I found IDA ICE very useful since I could assess the performance of several DSF types (naturally ventilated, mechanically ventilated, hybrid, airflow windows) and geometries (box windows, multi storey facades (see PhD thesis "Single and Double Skin Glazed Office Buildings. Analyses of Energy Use and Indoor Climate" http://www.ebd.lth.se/fileadmin/energi_byggnadsdesign/images/Publikationer/Bok_Dokt_avhandling_HP_G5.pdf).

DSF software validation was carried out under the IEA Task 34 Task (http://www.iea-shc.org/task34/).

A description of methods and tools to assess DSF performance is extensively described under a literature review (http://www.iea-shc.org/publications/downloads/Task34-Double_Skin_Facades_A_Literature_Review1.pdf).

I hope this helps.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Is there a quick model for double skins facades?

We are doing a project in a pretty cold climate. The project design has a really big glass fa?ade facing south. One of the ideas to reduce conductive heat loss is to create a double skin fa?ade on the south side.

Now I realize that this is going to take a fair amount of analysis work to design it properly. What I was wondering is if there is a quick analysis tool/methodology to tell if this is even feasible to go into more detailed analysis.

Any help would be much appreciated

IBPSA-USA MEETING ANNOUNCEMENT                    Dinner                 4:00-9:00 PM, Saturday, January 29, 2011                              Las Vegas, NVLocation: TBD   Schedule:  4-6pm IBPSA-USA Meeting  6-7pm Social Hour  7-9pm Dinner/Lecture  We are honored to present Dr Malcolm Cook to lead our evening presentation.   Dr Malcolm Cook is a Reader in Building Performance Modelling at Loughborough University and works in the area of building simulation and low energy building design. His research focuses on the use of computational fluid dynamics and dynamic thermal simulation programs for modelling natural ventilation in large non-domestic buildings. He has worked on research projects funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, the Department of Health and the EU. He has completed many consultancy projects for a wide range of clients worldwide which have included design and simulation work for health care buildings, schools and modern library buildings. His work is published in over 40 conference and journal papers and has contributed to awards for innovative building design, including the RIBA presidents gold medal for practice-based architecture (2007) and the CIBSE environmental initiative of the year award (2006). Malcolm is secretary for the CIBSE natural ventilation group, vice-chairman of the CIBSE Building Simulation group and chairman of the England affiliate of the International Building Performance Simulation Association.     This evening&rsquo;s presentation will cover the work Malcolm has undertaken during his time spent working with architects on low energy building design, with a particular focus on natural ventilation and passive cooling strategies, and the role computer simulation can play in this design process. Malcolm will talk about the simulation techniques employed, as well as the innovative passive design principles that have led to some of the UK&rsquo;s most energy efficient buildings. In addition to UK building projects, the talk but will also include work Malcolm completed as part of the design of the LEED Gold award winning Harm A. Weber Academic Center at Judson University, in Elgin, near Chicago. This building, which comprises office and library space, adopts a hybrid ventilation and cooling strategy which exploits the maximum benefit from natural ventilation before reverting to air-conditioning during the harsh winter and peak summer months. Results during the first year of operation are mixed. Malcolm hopes to &lsquo;unpack&rsquo; some of these issues during the presentation.

Message-ID: <0BA915866A92F542AA5018A148FE03232A8577@FGSERVER.fgroup.local>

Hi All,

My boss wants me to model a large AHU as a space by itself.  Our client
is running the heating loop at night (when it's below 40F), despite the
fans being off.  There is also a very leaky damper allowing fresh air in
to the space.  (I've got no cooling, and a fan mimicking the leaky
damper).  It's a wasteful practice, but we're trying to quantify How
wasteful it is.

 

My question is:

Is there a way to have the heating turn on/off based on an outdoor
temperature?

 

Since I couldn't find a way, I created a dummy zone with only
ventilation and no heating - but I still couldn't figure out a way to
use the temperature in the dummy zone to control the main zone.  The
only way I could think of was  Pkgd Single Zone, but that added cooling
and a condenser that I couldn't get rid of.

 

Anyway, Thanks for the help.  If I'm going about this the wrong way, I'd
appreciate any feedback.

 

Thank you.

Temperature<heatingavailabilityandsupplytemperature.htm>
HEAT-CONTROL

Takes a code-word that specifies how the air temperature leaving the system
heating coil is controlled. Allowed values are:

CONSTANT                  The supply air temperature is held nearly constant
at HEAT-SET-T; it can change a few degrees due to fan heat and throttling
range of the temperature controller.

COLDEST                    Sets the heating coil (hot deck) temperature each
hour to adequately heat the zone with the lowest temperature. The limits on
the supply air temperature are governed by coil capacities,
heatingschedules, and MAX-SUPPLY-
T. WARNING: If using the COLDEST or WARMEST options in conjunction with a
variable air volume system, there are two actions within the throttling
range. To reflect reality and to prevent instability in the simulation,
THROTTLING-RANGE should be increased to 4-6F (2-3K).

RESET                         Specifies use of HEAT-RESET-SCH for control of
heating air supply temperature based on outdoor air temperature.

SCHEDULED                Specifies use of HEAT-SET-SCH for control of
heating air supply temperature.

In SYSTEM TYPEs VAVS, RHFS, PVAVS, and PIU the HEAT-CONTROL keyword is
activated when COOL-CONTROL is set equal to WARMEST and a central
heatingcoil has been specified by giving
HEAT-SET-T a value greater than MIN-SUPPLY-T; in this case the only
non-ignored value for HEAT-CONTROL is COLDEST. When coldest/warmest control
is specified the controller first looks to see if any ZONE has a cooling
demand; if there is a ZONE cooling demand the AHU discharge temperature is
reset to attempt to just satisfy the ZONE with the largest cooling demand.
If no ZONE has a cooling demand the controller looks to satisfy the ZONE
with the greatest heating demand but without forcing any ZONE into creating
a cooling demand. If neither a heating or cooling demand is found for any
ZONE mixed air is passed.

Dear colleagues,

 

In case you are aware of an individual with a good foundation in
building design who is contemplating graduate work in building science
with an emphasis on building performance simulation, I invite you to
direct him or her to the Advanced Studies Program
<http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/academic/mdes/sustainability.htm>  at
Harvard University, Graduate School of Design. We are offering a 1.5
year long Master in Design Studies post-professional degree that teaches
students advanced simulation concepts in energy modeling, daylighting
and natural ventilation. Students enrolled in our program  further have
the opportunity to choose from a variety of classes related to
sustainability at the Harvard Business School, the Kennedy School of
Government and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. An
integral part of the degree is a research thesis that may address a
variety of topics including modeling urban neighborhoods, glare, light
and health, linking simulations with digital fabrication techniques,
continuous commissioning and climate change adaption (see ongoing
work>>) <http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/projects.html> .

 

I will be at Greenbuild next week and could meet with potential
candidates on Thursday morning between 11AM and noon to answer any
specific questions related to the program.

 

Thank-you and enjoy your weekends,

Brad,

Unfortunately, EE4 does not generate hourly reports.

Attached is a .pdf of a procedure I wrote up for creating an hourly 
report on total enduse kW (as required by HPNC) from an EE4 file.  It 
requires running your simulation in DOE outside of EE4 and describes 
that too.

Hope this helps.

Hi All,

I'm in search of a tool that can give me the total effective U-value and SHGC for a window with a shade. I've got all the relevant individual thermal/optical properties of the window and the shade. I was using Window6, but the inputs for the shades appear to be too limited for my application (I think; unless I'm missing something).

Thanks in advance.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] eQuest Dual duct & Multi zone system night setback
	question
Message-ID: <409589.43967.qm@web111713.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hello all,
Maybe it's a dummy question, but I still can not figure out how to do night 
setback for Dual duct or Multi zone systems.
It seems like the software uses mid-point of heating/cooling schedule as the set 
point to calculate the heating/cooling load and throttling range is like the 
difference between heating/cooling schedule. In the heating schedule the set 
point is the upper limit and cooling schedule is the lower limit.
So how I can do the night setback if I want 80F for the cooling during summer 
time and 60F for the heating during winter time? If eQuest use mid-point of 
heating and cooling, the temperature for the calculation still be 
(80+60)/2=70.........
Again, maybe it's a dummy question, but please hope someone can help me out and 
I really appreciate it!

By the way, if I want shut down heating during summer time for DD/MZ systems, I 
can set a lock out schedule for the heating loop or I can set a lock out 
schedule for the AHU. Am I right? Or there is some other ways to do it?



Sincerely,

James

Message-ID: <2868B61B17A740409A18C906719BEBB86CE366@EXC04COL1UK.uk.wspgroup.com>

Hi,

I was trying to work out how to investigate the impacts of single sided natural ventilation of a space through an opening. It seems to me that energy plus can only investigate cross flow ventilation even though energyplus can model bi-directional flow through a single opening. It appears to me that it requires two openings in all cases.

I am also wondering if I can then model two openings (one at high level, one at low level) on the same facade.

Can anyone help me understand the capabilities of energyplus for single sided natural ventilation?

Thanks in advance.

Ross

Ross,

Sorry I can't be of more help than pointing down a couple of avenues 
that you may have already ventured. But here goes:

It is worth searching the archives, then posting a message to the yahoo 
support group:
http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EnergyPlus_Support/
Many of the DOE team are on there regularly - more so than this mailing 
list. *hushed voice* they all seem to be overly obsessed with Equest on 
here...

Also, you could try investigating the example files with names 
containing *airflow*.idf in the .\Eplus\ExampleFiles directory. There is 
an excel file in the same directory that gives you an overview of the 
various models.

Setting up E+ for natural ventilation appears a little tricky to me. 
I've never done it apart from using the Designbuilder interface and 
cannot comment on bi-directional flow at present.

Thanks

Chris

Dear all,

Is there any psychrometric tool (preferably for free) that allows the use of
simulation results (instead of only weather data)? It would be interesting
to plot simulation results and, if possible, to compare with weather data
(filtering per months, seasons and/or time of the day).

I believe that our colleague was interested in a tool like that.

Best regards,

The @Air add-in for Excel has a 30 day free trial. http://www.techwareeng.com/ProdAA.html

Since psychrometric charts are simply points or regions on a plot of dry bulb temp / moisture content, @Air can be used to convert known properties e.g. dry bulb and wet bulb or dry bulb and RH into plotable variables.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Autodesk releases free Project Vasari Technology Preview
Message-ID: <3F13B159EE5F1743B4DFFCE1BC642C3113128CAD@005-TK5MPN1-003.MGDADSK.autodesk.com>

Project Vasari, a new, easy-to-use, standalone conceptual modeling and energy analysis tool based on the Revit platform, which is currently available as a technology preview on?Autodesk Labs (http://labs.autodesk.com/utilities/vasari/). Project Vasari is designed to increase accessibility for early design phase conceptual energy analysis beyond current Autodesk Revit Architecture software users.

"A building's sustainability is largely determined by key decisions made at the early conceptual design stage," said Phil Bernstein, vice president of industry relations for Autodesk. "The motivation behind the Revit Conceptual Energy Analysis tool and Project Vasari is to recognize this need with real solutions for the market. With Project Vasari, the entire world, not just users of Revit Architecture 2011, can see and experience many of the benefits of applying energy analysis at the early conceptual design phase."

About Project Vasari
Project Vasari is a standalone application built on the same technology as the Autodesk Revit platform. It is aimed at architectural designers and other professionals who do not need the production tools in the full Autodesk Revit Architecture software. Focused on conceptual building design using both geometric and parametric modeling, Project Vasari supports performance-based design via integrated energy modeling and analysis.
With the Revit Conceptual Energy Analysis tool as part of Project Vasari architects, engineers, contractors, building owners and students can automatically convert an architectural conceptual design into an analytical energy model to help gain insight into energy consumption and costs of multiple design options at the early conceptual stage.

Project Vasari, which does not require the user to own or subscribe to Autodesk Revit Architecture software, is available now as a technology preview at the?Autodesk Labs?website. After registering for a free Autodesk ID, and downloading and installing the Project Vasari application, users can conduct cloud-based energy analysis runs.

Key features include:

. Integrated energy analysis-Automatically rationalize concept models into energy models for analysis. As the conceptual design evolves, the energy model updates automatically.
. Cloud computing-Energy analysis is performed remotely through cloud computing, so a designer's local PC is available to process design modifications and perform other work after initiating the analysis.
. Graphical results-Evaluate design options side-by-side based on reports that compare energy use, lifecycle costs and breakdowns of consumption and loads. Communicate and deliver easy-to-understand graphical and raw data results to project stakeholders.
. Web-based climate data-Access a high-resolution global climate data set with more than 1.5 million weather data sets.
. Export to DOE-2.2 (eQuest) and EnergyPlus

Hi;

I have received several Viruses and Trojans on this eMAIL ACCOUNT which 
is solely for
the Energy Plus lists.

The most recent receipt of any technical merit was   

Virus name: "Trojan-Spy.HTML.Fraud.gen"


It was generated by a fake website called "Clicksafe" .  

"Clicksafe" is located in the UK when it is up and running..........

Here is the full header so list members can block the entire websites associated with these attacks.

Have a warm day !!

To clarify a little 'clicksafe' is a legitimate service run by lloyds
TSB bank:
https://www.clicksafe.lloydstsb.com/lloyds/registration/welcome.jsp

This virus email was not sent from that site, it merely purported to
be in order to look legitimate.

> Here is the full header so list members can block the entire websites associated with these attacks.

It would be unwise to block everything from 'clicksafe', especially if
you are an actual LLoyds customer. viruses and spam can and do claim
to come from anywhere, usually valid addresses. Just blocking them all
will also block real email. You need to go on content, not addresses.
>From (and to) addresses are essentially completely fake. Blocking all
mail containing Trojan-Spy.HTML.Fraud.gen _would_ be sensible.

If you know a bit about email headers or use an online service like
http://www.iptrackeronline.com/header.php you will find that it comes
from Texas, but that's not right either:

It is diguised to appear to simple-minded tools to come from
117.254.213.216 which is vstream.esc11.net. Esc11.net are the
Education Service Center, Region 11, in Ft. Worth, Texas, who the
scammers are trying to inciminate to people slightly more savvy than
the ones that think kit came from lloydsTSB clicksafe. 

But in fact the email (so far as I can tell - there may be more layers
of indirection which I'm not seeing, or net changes since it was
routed and delivered) came from 190.41.82.181, which is
server.iltucanoperu.com, which appears to be a small business in peru
with little clue about IT (judging from their 'default MS SBS server
install website' website: http://www.iltucanoperu.com/). Their ISP is
telefonica de Peru, which I presume is a big phone company/ISP. This
site is useful for looking these things up:
http://www.senderbase.org/senderbase_queries/detailip?search_string=190.41.82.181

So is appears that one of the computers there is virus infected or
part of a botnet, and is sending out fraud-assisting viruses to try
and get others into the same boat. 

The solution to this is virus- and spam-scanning your email, not
sending out the (misleading) headers to everyone on the list, few of
whom will be able to do anything useful with them. The hackers are
much more sophisticated when it comes to email filtering than most
building energy analysts at this point :-)

There are plenty of both free and paid-for solutions to the spam/virus
scanning problem. I use spamassassin + clamav which gets most of them
and doesn't cost anything. Online concentrator services tend to work
better (because they can see the whole email stream, not just yours),
but usually cost money.

All,

 

I am curious to know what programs/methodologies people have used to
effectively model the following types of energy recovery systems:

 

1.)     Dual Wheel Heat Recovery with a Cooling Coil between the wheels.
This system is similar to the SEMCO Pinnacle system. As the outdoor air
travels through the air handler it passes first through a total energy
wheel, then through a cooling coil and then through a passive
dehumidification wheel.  The exhaust air, as it leaves the building,
travels through the passive dehumidification wheel and then the total
energy wheel.

 

2.)    Twice through Heat Recovery with a Cooling Coil in between the
first and second pass.  This system is similar to a DesertAire system.
The outside air passes through the heat recovery device, through a
cooling coil, and then through the other side of the same heat recovery
device thus pre-cooling the outdoor air and reheating the supply air.

 

Please see the attached PDF for very simple schematic sketches of each
option.

 

Thanks,

 

Adam

The WeaTran software, which is available free-of-charge at the link below
reads TMY and EPW files and translates the data to other useful formats.
In addition, to help summarize a climate graphically, it displays a
psychrometric chart of monthly temp and humidity data as well as a
time-series chart of monthly solar radiation.

Hi,

I am trying to model a packaged VAV rooftop unit with fan-powered boxes in the perimeter zones. After hours the RTU fans are off and the fan-powered boxes cycle to maintain the night setback temperature.

How can I correctly model the fan energy for this system in EE4?

When I select "Packaged VAV" as my system type there is no option to enter any fan energy at the zone level.

What should I use for a fan schedule and what should I put under "Fan Operation" at the system level?

Currently I do not have the terminal fans entered anywhere, just the RTU fans. I am not sure if I am over estimating the fan energy because the RTU fans are cycling to maintain night setback; or if I am under estimating the fan energy because there are no fans operating at night.

Also, if I have an exhaust fan in my RTU in addition to the supply fan and return fan, should I include it with my supply fan or with my return fan?

Thanks,

All,
Has anyone been able to utilize (i.e. been submitted and accepted by GBCI) the specific lab baselines in the 2007 PRM instead of dividing systems into multiple single zone systems that are expected by using the "pressurization" exception c to Table G3.1.1. Or has anyone just used 2004 with addendum am (VAV minimum air = ventilation air) for lab areas and ignored the "pressurization" exception?
 
And if one must use the 2004 PRM baseline of multiple PSZs for a VAV lab system, and if some zones only have general exhaust, what exactly is the outside air and exhaust for each system? Would it be the minimum outside air or the design air (driven by the heat load), all of which happens to be outside air in the VAV system, but which would not need be 100% OA in an SZ system? 
 
Thanks for any experience that you could bring to bear on this.

You could try entering the fan power as a sensible process load on perimeter zones.  You'd also need to come up with a custom process schedule to estimate cycling.  Of course this is regulated load so it should be taken out of the equipment end use and added to fans.

Just a thought, but a packaged VAV system is a cold deck system, so I don't think the fans cycle on to maintain a heating setpoint.  Instead, the terminal heat would come on.

Regards,
Kyle

Hi Fred,
We have succeeded (submitted and awarded) in using all of 2007 App. G. for a few LEED 2.2 lab projects, including the part about the lab specific baseline VAV system.  There is a CIR for EAp2 that allows you to choose all of 2007 App. G. in lieu of 2004 App. G. if desired.

I haven't used EE4 recently, but with eQUEST, you can model the system
explicitly as a series fan powered VAV, and input the fan power for the
boxes directly.

You can't directly model this system in EE4.  The only solution is to 
create your project in EE4 then edit the proposed .DOE file to add in 
the series fan powered box statements at each zone.  You then have to 
run the file from the command line.

Hello all,

 

I just wanted to get your opinions on IES-VE vs. eQuest vs. Trace in terms of load calcs and energy modeling. Each have their pros and cons but I have only had experience on load calcs on Trane Trace and energy modeling with eQuest. I recently have been exposed to IES-VE and it seems the software can save lots of time during the input stage for energy modeling but not too sure on the load calculation. I think it would be nice if in the future, we see the two tasks merged into a software package that can master both, thanks!

Message-ID: <AANLkTin+4BWrjjdpuYG3Yt3sMqDHd7WXr2_5Sd9FfzHb@mail.gmail.com>

I would like to extend a very grateful thank you to the EnergyPlus
development team for the improvements made to model run-time found in
EnergyPlus v.6

I have a very large project for which the energy model required just over 40
hours of run-time to complete a detailed model in version 5.

I added Output:Diagnostics,

CreateMinimalSurfaceVariables; and also changed any parameters that I could
to speed up the run-time, and it still took 13 hours in version 5 to
complete the run.

I simply transitioned this file into version 6 and the run completed in 2
hours!!!

If you are an energy modeler who has avoided adopting EnergyPlus due to
concerns about run-time, I would say that the developers have done a
wonderful job of addressing this issue. I have found that, with the most
recent version, models can be run in a reasonable amount of time regardless
of the complexity of the geometry and/or systems.

Many Thanks,

Hello,

I am trying to model a MURB with distributed heat pumps and a gas fired
make-up air unit. The heat pump loop is attached to a ground field heat
exchanger and a supplementary boiler.  I am getting very strange results:
the model is showing negative savings. Upon closer inspection, it seems like
the reference building does not have any heating created.  I have followed
the instruction in the EE4 modelling guide...am I missing something?

Hi William,

My personal experience is that Trance, EnergyPro, etc will be time-saving
tools at the initial design stage. Without building up virtual 3D model, you
can quickly size the system by inputing necessary infomation.

IES-VE is a robust modeling package which can fulfill your requirements from
initial load calculation all the way to in-depth energy analysis. However,
3D model building is its very first step. I personally believe it is
slightly time-consuming for only load calculation especially when a design
is at its initial stage and designers may change ideas quite often. The
problem is that changing 3D geometry in IESVE is not as easy as data entry
method employed in Trance or EnergyPro.

Regards,

Cheney

Neeraj, it is in fact the contrary. 

 

ASHRAE 90.1-2007 Appendix G requires you to model Baseline Airflow Rate using a 20-degree F temperature difference between the supply air and room air temperatures. Therefore, if your room set point is 75F for cooling, set your cooling leaving air temperature to 55F and vice versa for heating; 72F heating set point requires a 92F leaving air temperature. This establishes your CFM airflow within the model. Do not vary these to adjust unmet hours.

 

If you have unmet heating or cooling hours (over 300 or greater than 50 between baseline and proposed), you may incrementally adjust the baseline cooling and heating capacities (originally oversized 15% and 25% respectively) accordingly to reduce the overall unmet hours (below 300) or the difference between baseline and proposed (within 50).

 

Before taking this step, be sure to look at your thermostat drift points. If the cooling set point is 75, but the cooling drift point is 84, when the space is unoccupied this would allow the space to move toward 84 degrees. When the space becomes occupied and the simulation tries to cool to 75, the system will not be able to achieve this within the allotted time (1 hour) and you will have an unmet cooling hour. 

 

There are some changes to ASHRAE 90.1-2010 that will effect unmet hours, but for the time being, if you are modeling a project using 2007 or 2004, this method should help you eliminate the unmet hours.

Hello Jaigath,
Using the performance rating method (PRM), in my experience it is usually an issue of low supply CFM.
Correct me if I am wrong but on the contrary I think that ASHARE baseline PRM fixes the cooling and heating capacities to 1.15 and 1.25 respectively and the user is allowed to bump up the supply CFM in increments if necessary.
I have a feeling that the issue of unmet load hours has been discussed many times before -- so, the archives will be a good resource as well.
Best,

Hello All,

I would like to know how other increase their baseline capacity when they have unmet load. I have a PSZHP system and in one system, I got more than 400 hrs unmet load. I usually just increase the TR cooling capacity until I get a lower unmet load but in this case, I think the unmet load is due to low supply cfm. Is it ok to adjust also the supply fan cfm? I am thinking that G3.1.2.2 only requires me to adjust only the cooling capacity. Do others adjust both cfm and cooling load?

Thanks,

Jaigath

Hi Michael,

 

I?d like to offer a quick heads up ? your interpretation of what 90.1 has to say regarding addressing unmet hours is spot on and well-stated, no disagreements here.  Neeraj however is indirectly making a pretty valid point that I?d hate for anyone to miss?

 

If you only ever approach addressing unmet hours by bumping the oversizing factors, you may well be missing something critical.  I for one was in this train of thought when I started out.  To the letter of the standard, indeed this is all we?re *prescribed* to do to remedy the situation, but this approach will not always work, and may result in baseline models with a very skewed performance ? suffice it to say skewed is not always a *good* thing, even if it does make your performance numbers look good.

 

Whenever I have unmet hours, I?ve learned through others on these lists to investigate the ?why? and ?when? of those unmet hours as a first step.  More often than not, unmet hours in my models, when they do occur, have nothing to do with lacking heating or cooling capacity ? fan (airflow) scheduling conflicts, thermostat setpoints and unrealistic deadbands are the primary culprits.  The systems effectively aren?t running as frequently or for a duration as they should be.

 

When this is the case, and I can assure Neeraj is not alone in this experience, fluffing the oversizing factor may appear to ?remedy? the issue, but often as not may *not*  be enough to pull your baseline/proposed models into the prescribed requirements for unmet hours.  In some cases, you might even make the situation worse.  I?m pretty sure the spirit of the standard, by specifying a maximum number of unmet hours, is to allow both the proposed and baseline systems to run when they need to satisfy the loads

 

For whatever combination of reasons, and luck may be a part of it, it has been a long while since I?ve created an autosizing 90.1 baseline model whose unmet hours did not ring in at either zero or the single digits, and as such did not require any adjustments.  I personally feel this has had a lot to do with understanding the mechanics behind what defines and can cause an unmet hour ? as you?re getting at with consideration to drift points.  

 

As you say, future versions of 90.1 may be more nuanced, but I personally feel the manner in which unmet hours are currently addressed does a disservice to those aspiring to be quality energy modelers ? one can easily be misled to believe an unmet load hour is a problem in and of itself with an easy ?fix,? without recognizing it?s really a symptom of a problem... bumping capacities without first addressing the cause of unmet hours is something like a doctor only giving you a band-aid for a cut when what you need is a tetanus shot!

 

It may be worth mentioning that my experience is dominantly within the world of  eQuest/DOE2.  I would not be surprised to find other engines/software have varying ?typical? causes of unmet hours.

 

Anyway, that?s my two cents, for what it?s worth =) ? hope it might help lead others along the path!

Using the performance rating method (PRM), in my experience it is usually an issue of low supply CFM.
Correct me if I am wrong but on the contrary I think that ASHARE baseline PRM fixes the cooling and heating capacities to 1.15 and 1.25 respectively and the user is allowed to bump up the supply CFM in increments if necessary.
I have a feeling that the issue of unmet load hours has been discussed many times before -- so, the archives will be a good resource as well.
Best,
Neeraj

Hello All,

I would like to know how other increase their baseline capacity when they have unmet load. I have a PSZHP system and in one system, I got more than 400 hrs unmet load. I usually just increase the TR cooling capacity until I get a lower unmet load but in this case, I think the unmet load is due to low supply cfm. Is it ok to adjust also the supply fan cfm? I am thinking that G3.1.2.2 only requires me to adjust only the cooling capacity. Do others adjust both cfm and cooling load?

Thanks,

Jaigath

Hi All,

I think Nick is spot on in his discussion re unmet hours. While I'm not
saying it's a wrong thing to do, I personally have never used oversizing the
system as a way to get rid of unmet hours.

As an example, I have been helping someone off the list with his project, a
seemingly very simple building with only 5 thermal zones and one PVAVS air
handler with dx cooling and hot water heating - system 5. After running my 4
exposures, and having none of them with *any* hours of unmet loads, I
calculated my kW/cfm, heating load, cooling load, boiler kW and all of that,
put the calculated results in the baseline, reran the baseline, and for some
darn reason I had over 1000 hours of unmet cooling loads.

I checked all my inputs, made a few changes, reran the 4 exposures, and not
much changed. So, I put on my thinking cap and read Nick's email - not
necessarily in that order. One of the things that occurred to me is that
since the building is turned off all weekend my Monday morning pull down
loads during the summer might be the cause of the problem, so I put in an
optimum start schedule (this might have been required, I haven't double
checked) and my unmet hours were reduced by about 300 hours. I had an
adequate cfm/sf, something I'm not shy about raising at all since eQUEST
defaults it to 0.5 cfm/sf which is usually too small, so I didn't change it.
Then I looked at the throttling-range.

For VAV systems the eQUEST/DOE2 manuals say that the throttling range should
be *at least* 4 degrees to insure stable operation and that is what I had it
at originally. After thinking about it and doing some simple math in my head
I raised it to 6 degrees. My cooling temperature is set at 75 degrees so
this means when my room temperature reads 79, set point temp + 1/2 TR + 1
degree, my cooling coils will be activated. Before I did this I had also
looked at my SS-F reports and could see that my room temps weren't that far
off from the set point temp when I had under cooled hours reported. Using
the new throttling range brought me down to less than 500 hours of unmet
loads, which may work.

So this is an example of the thinking around what's going on and developing
a strategy that makes sense for a specific building. I also looked at my
heating/cooling temp schedules, etc., as Nick mentioned. What baffles me is
why, after none of my 4 exposures showed any unmet load hours, my baseline
did. I, like Nick, have not had that happen before. Perhaps it has something
to do with the way the building was zoned, 4 exposures and a core but I
don't know for sure.

Any ideas?

Some good discussion about unmet hours, to summarize_

Check_
a. Occupied setpoint, unoccupied drifting point delta
b. Throttling range
c. Fan schedule conflicts with load req.

What about additional considerations like_
- Conflicting mix of zones supplied by AHU
- Extreme zone controlling thermostat
- Perimeter condition not addressed
- Water line sizing inadequate to meet flow
- Missing pumps

Hello Olenksandra,

I also once got the same problem of getting negative savings.  At that point
I spoke to someone and he told me that probably I changed one default value
which should be kept as is according to MNECB guidelines, such as schedule,
room set temperature etc.  However, I am not too sure about it.  I hope
someone else can give a better answer to your question.

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=AX96n1AN8MZqS3o3Ee2Jr1yBZ2WvUMa9+LcCb@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

Hopefully most of you have experience with modelling domestic hot water
system in eQuest.  First of all, according to Natural Resource Canada, the
annual Domestic Hot Water (DHW) heating consumption for residential
apartment buildings are about 15-20% of the total heating load.
I have recently model a DHW, where my water heating load was 5 times the
space heating load,which I found very unusual.  I sized the water storage
and boiler based on ASPE table, which specifies hot water flow rate in the
fixtures.  I also multiplied the load with a demand factor of 0.30 and
storage with a factor of 1.25.  I set the process flow rate by dividing the
demad with 60 (hourly demand/60 = GPM).  Design water temperature was set at
120 F.  Recirculation rate was 8 GPM.  Have I made any mistake?  Should I
have set the process flow rate at something else other than just dividing
the GPH by 60?  I would really appreciate if someone can answer it.  Thanks
all in advance.

Hassan Quazi

I deal with unmet hours by supplying more air rather than upsizing capacity,
and it has worked.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Adjusting Capacity for Unmet Cooling

 

Hi All,

I think Nick is spot on in his discussion re unmet hours. While I'm not
saying it's a wrong thing to do, I personally have never used oversizing the
system as a way to get rid of unmet hours.

As an example, I have been helping someone off the list with his project, a
seemingly very simple building with only 5 thermal zones and one PVAVS air
handler with dx cooling and hot water heating - system 5. After running my 4
exposures, and having none of them with any hours of unmet loads, I
calculated my kW/cfm, heating load, cooling load, boiler kW and all of that,
put the calculated results in the baseline, reran the baseline, and for some
darn reason I had over 1000 hours of unmet cooling loads.

I checked all my inputs, made a few changes, reran the 4 exposures, and not
much changed. So, I put on my thinking cap and read Nick's email - not
necessarily in that order. One of the things that occurred to me is that
since the building is turned off all weekend my Monday morning pull down
loads during the summer might be the cause of the problem, so I put in an
optimum start schedule (this might have been required, I haven't double
checked) and my unmet hours were reduced by about 300 hours. I had an
adequate cfm/sf, something I'm not shy about raising at all since eQUEST
defaults it to 0.5 cfm/sf which is usually too small, so I didn't change it.
Then I looked at the throttling-range. 

For VAV systems the eQUEST/DOE2 manuals say that the throttling range should
be at least 4 degrees to insure stable operation and that is what I had it
at originally. After thinking about it and doing some simple math in my head
I raised it to 6 degrees. My cooling temperature is set at 75 degrees so
this means when my room temperature reads 79, set point temp + 1/2 TR + 1
degree, my cooling coils will be activated. Before I did this I had also
looked at my SS-F reports and could see that my room temps weren't that far
off from the set point temp when I had under cooled hours reported. Using
the new throttling range brought me down to less than 500 hours of unmet
loads, which may work.

So this is an example of the thinking around what's going on and developing
a strategy that makes sense for a specific building. I also looked at my
heating/cooling temp schedules, etc., as Nick mentioned. What baffles me is
why, after none of my 4 exposures showed any unmet load hours, my baseline
did. I, like Nick, have not had that happen before. Perhaps it has something
to do with the way the building was zoned, 4 exposures and a core but I
don't know for sure.

Any ideas?

Hi Michael,

 

I'd like to offer a quick heads up - your interpretation of what 90.1 has to
say regarding addressing unmet hours is spot on and well-stated, no
disagreements here.  Neeraj however is indirectly making a pretty valid
point that I'd hate for anyone to miss.

 

If you only ever approach addressing unmet hours by bumping the oversizing
factors, you may well be missing something critical.  I for one was in this
train of thought when I started out.  To the letter of the standard, indeed
this is all we're *prescribed* to do to remedy the situation, but this
approach will not always work, and may result in baseline models with a very
skewed performance - suffice it to say skewed is not always a *good* thing,
even if it does make your performance numbers look good.

 

Whenever I have unmet hours, I've learned through others on these lists to
investigate the "why" and "when" of those unmet hours as a first step.  More
often than not, unmet hours in my models, when they do occur, have nothing
to do with lacking heating or cooling capacity - fan (airflow) scheduling
conflicts, thermostat setpoints and unrealistic deadbands are the primary
culprits.  The systems effectively aren't running as frequently or for a
duration as they should be.

 

When this is the case, and I can assure Neeraj is not alone in this
experience, fluffing the oversizing factor may appear to "remedy" the issue,
but often as not may *not*  be enough to pull your baseline/proposed models
into the prescribed requirements for unmet hours.  In some cases, you might
even make the situation worse.  I'm pretty sure the spirit of the standard,
by specifying a maximum number of unmet hours, is to allow both the proposed
and baseline systems to run when they need to satisfy the loads

 

For whatever combination of reasons, and luck may be a part of it, it has
been a long while since I've created an autosizing 90.1 baseline model whose
unmet hours did not ring in at either zero or the single digits, and as such
did not require any adjustments.  I personally feel this has had a lot to do
with understanding the mechanics behind what defines and can cause an unmet
hour - as you're getting at with consideration to drift points.  

 

As you say, future versions of 90.1 may be more nuanced, but I personally
feel the manner in which unmet hours are currently addressed does a
disservice to those aspiring to be quality energy modelers - one can easily
be misled to believe an unmet load hour is a problem in and of itself with
an easy "fix," without recognizing it's really a symptom of a problem...
bumping capacities without first addressing the cause of unmet hours is
something like a doctor only giving you a band-aid for a cut when what you
need is a tetanus shot!

 

It may be worth mentioning that my experience is dominantly within the world
of  eQuest/DOE2.  I would not be surprised to find other engines/software
have varying "typical" causes of unmet hours.

 

Anyway, that's my two cents, for what it's worth =) - hope it might help
lead others along the path!

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Adjusting Capacity for Unmet Cooling

 

Neeraj, it is in fact the contrary. 

 

ASHRAE 90.1-2007 Appendix G requires you to model Baseline Airflow Rate
using a 20-degree F temperature difference between the supply air and room
air temperatures. Therefore, if your room set point is 75F for cooling, set
your cooling leaving air temperature to 55F and vice versa for heating; 72F
heating set point requires a 92F leaving air temperature. This establishes
your CFM airflow within the model. Do not vary these to adjust unmet hours.

 

If you have unmet heating or cooling hours (over 300 or greater than 50
between baseline and proposed), you may incrementally adjust the baseline
cooling and heating capacities (originally oversized 15% and 25%
respectively) accordingly to reduce the overall unmet hours (below 300) or
the difference between baseline and proposed (within 50).

 

Before taking this step, be sure to look at your thermostat drift points. If
the cooling set point is 75, but the cooling drift point is 84, when the
space is unoccupied this would allow the space to move toward 84 degrees.
When the space becomes occupied and the simulation tries to cool to 75, the
system will not be able to achieve this within the allotted time (1 hour)
and you will have an unmet cooling hour. 

 

There are some changes to ASHRAE 90.1-2010 that will effect unmet hours, but
for the time being, if you are modeling a project using 2007 or 2004, this
method should help you eliminate the unmet hours.

Hello Jaigath,
Using the performance rating method (PRM), in my experience it is usually an
issue of low supply CFM.
Correct me if I am wrong but on the contrary I think that ASHARE baseline
PRM fixes the cooling and heating capacities to 1.15 and 1.25 respectively
and the user is allowed to bump up the supply CFM in increments if
necessary.
I have a feeling that the issue of unmet load hours has been discussed many
times before -- so, the archives will be a good resource as well.
Best,
Neeraj

Hello All,

I would like to know how other increase their baseline capacity when they
have unmet load. I have a PSZHP system and in one system, I got more than
400 hrs unmet load. I usually just increase the TR cooling capacity until I
get a lower unmet load but in this case, I think the unmet load is due to
low supply cfm. Is it ok to adjust also the supply fan cfm? I am thinking
that G3.1.2.2 only requires me to adjust only the cooling capacity. Do
others adjust both cfm and cooling load?

Thanks,

Jaigath

Thank you for all your help. It seems to be that the issue can be solved by
changing the room type from multi-residential to dorm-bedroom.  This results
in a proper reference building with heating. I think this strategy is valid
under the EE4 modeling guidelines as this is the suggested way to take
credit for any hardwired efficient lighting in the suites. Of course some of
the defaults and schedules have to be reset to reflect the actual space
use...

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED C&S and non-cooled spaces
Message-ID: <20101122190409.86AEC4800C@diego.dreamhost.com>

I am modelling a project for LEED C&S.  Two utility spaces have 
electric heaters, no cooling.  In 90.1-2004, Table 11.3.1, 10 HVAC Systems:
"(d) Where no cooling system exists or no cooling system has been 
specified, the cooling system shall be modeled as an air-cooled 
single-zone system, one unit per thermal block. The system 
characteristics shall be identical to the system modeled in the 
budget building design."

Does this mean that these two utility spaces are to have packaged 
single zone system with DX cooling?  Or does it mean that the only 
cooling is by outdoor air ("air-cooled")?

Thanks for any insights!

Nick,

 

Thank you for the response. My first energy modeling experience was with eQuest, but have been using Trane?s TRACE 700 more extensively. In addition to the bldg-sim lists, the TRACE support is an excellent resource for those using the software, especially when it comes to unmet hours.

 

As you mention, and as I was alluding to in my third paragraph (starting with ?Before taking this step,?), there are certainly other areas that should be addressed prior to adjusting the cooling and heating capacities. I was not trying to cover all of them and did not want to get too in depth, as there are numerous areas that could be contributing to the unmet load hours and a review of the model would be necessary to determine what changes must be made to remedy the model. I?d like to note that I said the model and not the unmet hours. As you and Carol have illustrated, I fully agree that we aren?t supposed to be trying to manipulate the model to give us our desired outcome, but rather provide an accurate model. I do not think anyone should be taking liberty with the capacities to such extremes just to meet the requirements for unmet load hours. I even scratched my head the first time I read through that section and thought, ?well what?s the point??

 

My response wasn?t meant to suggest that modelers wildly vary cooling and heating capacities to obtain their desired results, but to clarify that Neeraj?s comment (copied below) was in fact contrary to what ASHRAE requires in Appendix G. Perhaps a few disclaimers were in order J

Correct me if I am wrong but on the contrary I think that ASHARE baseline PRM fixes the cooling and heating capacities to 1.15 and 1.25 respectively and the user is allowed to bump up the supply CFM in increments if necessary.

 

In conclusion, I offer these bullet points:

?         Design airflow rates are set using a 20-degree delta T between supply air and room space

o   These shall not be adjusted to ?fix? unmet hours

?         Baseline cooling and heating capacities are initially set to 115% and 125% respectively

o   These may be adjusted incrementally, but should not be relied upon to ?fix? a poorly produced model. In fact, their adjustment should be considered last, after all other approaches have failed.

?         It is important to understand what an unmet hour is and why they occur

o   It is of even greater importance to remedy the cause of the unmet hour rather than ?fudging? the numbers

o   Refer to your software?s Building Temperature Profile report, if such a report exists, to help find the source (space, system, etc) of the unmet hours

o   Thermostat Drift Points and Utilization Schedules have been primary culprits

?  Other areas affecting unmet hours include but are not limited to the following: Thermostat placement, fan cycle operation, optimum starts, building envelope entries, Ventilation (outside air) schedules

 

Happy modeling!

Hi Michael,

 

I?d like to offer a quick heads up ? your interpretation of what 90.1 has to say regarding addressing unmet hours is spot on and well-stated, no disagreements here.  Neeraj however is indirectly making a pretty valid point that I?d hate for anyone to miss?

 

If you only ever approach addressing unmet hours by bumping the oversizing factors, you may well be missing something critical.  I for one was in this train of thought when I started out.  To the letter of the standard, indeed this is all we?re *prescribed* to do to remedy the situation, but this approach will not always work, and may result in baseline models with a very skewed performance ? suffice it to say skewed is not always a *good* thing, even if it does make your performance numbers look good.

 

Whenever I have unmet hours, I?ve learned through others on these lists to investigate the ?why? and ?when? of those unmet hours as a first step.  More often than not, unmet hours in my models, when they do occur, have nothing to do with lacking heating or cooling capacity ? fan (airflow) scheduling conflicts, thermostat setpoints and unrealistic deadbands are the primary culprits.  The systems effectively aren?t running as frequently or for a duration as they should be.

 

When this is the case, and I can assure Neeraj is not alone in this experience, fluffing the oversizing factor may appear to ?remedy? the issue, but often as not may *not*  be enough to pull your baseline/proposed models into the prescribed requirements for unmet hours.  In some cases, you might even make the situation worse.  I?m pretty sure the spirit of the standard, by specifying a maximum number of unmet hours, is to allow both the proposed and baseline systems to run when they need to satisfy the loads

 

For whatever combination of reasons, and luck may be a part of it, it has been a long while since I?ve created an autosizing 90.1 baseline model whose unmet hours did not ring in at either zero or the single digits, and as such did not require any adjustments.  I personally feel this has had a lot to do with understanding the mechanics behind what defines and can cause an unmet hour ? as you?re getting at with consideration to drift points.  

 

As you say, future versions of 90.1 may be more nuanced, but I personally feel the manner in which unmet hours are currently addressed does a disservice to those aspiring to be quality energy modelers ? one can easily be misled to believe an unmet load hour is a problem in and of itself with an easy ?fix,? without recognizing it?s really a symptom of a problem... bumping capacities without first addressing the cause of unmet hours is something like a doctor only giving you a band-aid for a cut when what you need is a tetanus shot!

 

It may be worth mentioning that my experience is dominantly within the world of  eQuest/DOE2.  I would not be surprised to find other engines/software have varying ?typical? causes of unmet hours.

 

Anyway, that?s my two cents, for what it?s worth =) ? hope it might help lead others along the path!

 

~Nick

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Adjusting Capacity for Unmet Cooling

 

Neeraj, it is in fact the contrary. 

 

ASHRAE 90.1-2007 Appendix G requires you to model Baseline Airflow Rate using a 20-degree F temperature difference between the supply air and room air temperatures. Therefore, if your room set point is 75F for cooling, set your cooling leaving air temperature to 55F and vice versa for heating; 72F heating set point requires a 92F leaving air temperature. This establishes your CFM airflow within the model. Do not vary these to adjust unmet hours.

 

If you have unmet heating or cooling hours (over 300 or greater than 50 between baseline and proposed), you may incrementally adjust the baseline cooling and heating capacities (originally oversized 15% and 25% respectively) accordingly to reduce the overall unmet hours (below 300) or the difference between baseline and proposed (within 50).

 

Before taking this step, be sure to look at your thermostat drift points. If the cooling set point is 75, but the cooling drift point is 84, when the space is unoccupied this would allow the space to move toward 84 degrees. When the space becomes occupied and the simulation tries to cool to 75, the system will not be able to achieve this within the allotted time (1 hour) and you will have an unmet cooling hour. 

 

There are some changes to ASHRAE 90.1-2010 that will effect unmet hours, but for the time being, if you are modeling a project using 2007 or 2004, this method should help you eliminate the unmet hours.

Hello Jaigath,
Using the performance rating method (PRM), in my experience it is usually an issue of low supply CFM.
Correct me if I am wrong but on the contrary I think that ASHARE baseline PRM fixes the cooling and heating capacities to 1.15 and 1.25 respectively and the user is allowed to bump up the supply CFM in increments if necessary.
I have a feeling that the issue of unmet load hours has been discussed many times before -- so, the archives will be a good resource as well.
Best,
Neeraj

Hello All,

I would like to know how other increase their baseline capacity when they have unmet load. I have a PSZHP system and in one system, I got more than 400 hrs unmet load. I usually just increase the TR cooling capacity until I get a lower unmet load but in this case, I think the unmet load is due to low supply cfm. Is it ok to adjust also the supply fan cfm? I am thinking that G3.1.2.2 only requires me to adjust only the cooling capacity. Do others adjust both cfm and cooling load?

Thanks,

Jaigath

I'm not aware of any direct conversion possible from 3D dxf to gbXML. You
should be able to import a 3D dxf into SketchUp though which might give you
some options for exporting afterwards. Certainly with the IES <VE> you can
use a plugin to export the model back out. 

 

Kind regards

I can't give an exact answer, but the first thought is that DXF is for
geometrical information, while the gbXML schema is for thermal properties
and zoning, hence the DXF isn't generally directly converted or even
convertible into gbXML.

More common though is to import DXF into Sketchup and then use the geometry
as a basis to trace the thermal zoning. I have done this using a DXF in
OpenStudio (http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/openstudio.cfm)
to create (manually) an IDF file, which is the input file for EnergyPlus.

You could check whether DesignBuilder can import IDF geometry (it is based
on EnergyPlus after all!), and there could be your solution, let me know how
it turns out!

Cheers and good luck,

Marcus

Julian,
We have been working in a pretty complicated (geometry wise) project and we have managed to export .gbxml files to be imported in Design Builder using AutoCAD MEP.
However, there was an issue in DB with the number of vertices in each node (if I remember correctly could not handle more than 3 vertices per node for a building block). We went around this problem by importing it as outline block then cutting it accordingly, then converting it to building block, then adding holes and finally merging the adjacent zones. Long process but eventually it worked. If your geometry is simpler it would not be that difficult.

Best regards,
Harris Poirazis

Hi Chris,

 

eQuest will allow you to create a system without assigning a zone
(though the sim wouldn't run until you assign one). However it won't let
you assign a thermal zone without an unassigned space defined in the
project, which is leading to your error. So you have to work in reverse,
creating the unassigned space first.

 

There are two easy ways to do it:

 

1)       Create a space in the Building Shell tab. Right click the top
line of your project tree and choose "create space." You can create a
dummy space that will at least allow you to assign a zone to your PVVT
system so you can start entering your specs. Back on the air-side tab,
when you select "Create child thermal zone" for your new system, the
second popup box will contain a drop down that includes the space you
created.

2)       You might already have the zone defined that you'd like to put
on the PVVT. In this case, delete it from its current system under the
air-side tab. Then create your new system. The zone selection dropdown
will now include the zone you "deleted" (actually you only unassigned
it). Just pay attention to your control zones through the process. You
will likely have to go back and modify these after you get everything
set up.

I need help with the following message:

"At least one space component with no corresponding zone must exist
prior to creating a new zone"

I'm sure it is a simple fix. We are trying ot create a PVVT system in
detailed edit mode.

Thanks!

Hello all,

Can I take credit for energy savings due to exterior lighting and unheated parking garage lighting in a LEED energy model?

Are these both considered non-regulated process loads?

What is the procedure for this? Do I include the energy usage from these two loads in the proposed and reference building energy usage? Or do I exclude them both and then subtract the savings from the proposed building energy usage?

Can anyone tell me what to use as the lighting power for my MNECB reference building?

Thanks,

Hey Brian,

 

For LEED:

 

Parking garage lighting is something you simply have to include (not
subtract out) in your models (90.1-2007, TG3.1.6.e).  Give it
scheduling/controls and installed wattage to match your true design in
the proposed model.  For the baseline model, review the sub-notes in the
spreadsheet provided for EAc1 documentation first - you need to
calculate the allowable wattage minus any difference in the
nontrade-able sums... I can't think of how to phrase that more clearly
so I'm suggesting you check that item out yourself to avoid any mixups
=).  

 

I believe the wording of 90.1-2007 locks out the opportunity to
demonstrate an "above and beyond" exterior lighting control scheme (I've
done that in the past for 90.1-2004 modeling)... But I'm not 100% sure -
it may be worth your time to compare your actual control scheme(s)
against what would be required as mandatory provisions in chapter 9.  

 

As an example: you might be able to schedule some of your exterior
lighting loads differently if you have photocells turning off otherwise
24/7 lighting around your open garage's exterior perimeter, as I don't
believe 90.1 requires this.

 

MNECB on the other hand is something I've never dealt with in my career
here in Kansas... so I can't comment to that ;).

 

~Nick

Hi Sambhav,

I just did a quick yet simple calculation for you as follows:

1. Assuming plant load is X
2. Assuming chiller energy requirement is Y
3. Y1= X/3.2 and Y2 = X/2.6
4. Y1/Y2 = (X/3.2) / (X/2.6) = 0.81

In this case, around 20% difference is possible.

Cheers,

Cheney

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Supply air temperature reset and economiser
Message-ID: <4CEFAF48.7030307@gmail.com>

Dear Bldg-sim,

I am having some difficulty with the definition of outdoor air reset 
temperatures.
Clause G.3.1.3.12 of A90.1 (2007) states:
/The air temperature for cooling shall be reset higher by 2.3degC under 
the minimum cooling load conditions./
Question 1: We are not using DOE2 or EQuest. How are the "minimum 
cooling load conditions" decided?

Question2: During non-occupancy and cold external conditions, what SA 
temperature setpoint should be used? For example, if the air handler 
cycles during night to meet Zone heating setpoints, the SAT setpoint 
must be close to the RAT otherwise the system will first cool (possibly 
by increasing cold outdoor air) and then reheat the air in the zones.

Question 3: For the sake of comparison we generated a file similar to 
our model using the E+ example file generator but when we queried it, it 
appeared to operate the economiser via a differential enthalpy. A90 
appears to stipulate a fixed Dry Bulb shutoff (G3.1.2.7). Is the example 
file in error here?

Best regards

Chris,

If you go to http://www.doe2.com/download/Weather/ and look at the files
listed under CTMY, CTMT2 and CWEC, you can see all the Canadian site
eQUEST/DOE2.2 has available to it. I don't see Whistler but perhaps one of
the other sites is close enough. Another good source for weather files is
Whitebox Technologies, Joe Huang's company. If you call or email they can
tell you whether they have data for Whistler.

Cheers,

Carol

Hi Ross,

There is certainly no problem with running a 21 zone natural ventilation model in EnergyPlus. We've successfully run much larger models. You may find that it helps to increase both the Absolute and Relative airflow convergence tolerance values in the AirflowNetwork:SimulationControl data by a factor of 10. If that doesn't do it, try increasing again.

This can help where there are very large openings such as horizontal openings between spaces.

Regards,

Andy Tindale

Message-ID: <22CE8791E7DE554FB00676D7248C6B5533420939@AKFMAILPA.AKF-ENG.COM>


A recent LEED MV plan review comment asked "please indicate the proposed calibration method to account for the local weather conditions during the performance period."

This raises the question for me - are model results significantly impacted by the difference between historic weather data and performance-period data?

When I'm engaged in Measurement and Verification, I can install a weather station that records data for performance period to allow for calibration. (http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/Publications/BuildingSimulation2009.GundHallModel.pdf)

But for an investment-grade energy audit with historic bills, I'm not sure where to turn for all the variables needed to construct a weather file.

Anyone on this list have a recommendation?

(I'm specifically looking for NYC, 2009, weather data for an eQUEST model.)

Aaron-

The question "are model results significantly impacted by the difference 
between historic weather data and performance-period data" is a complex 
one, however, here is an approach that may be helpful if you need to 
construct your own custom weather file.

You can purchase historical weather data available from NOAA station 
data from the NCDC <http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/ncdc.html>.  However, 
these data sets do not include solar radiation data and often need some 
QC work (remove extraneous observations, fill gaps, etc).  In the past, 
I have also downloaded weather data from the EnergyPlus 
<http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/weatherdata_download.cfm> 
site in IWEC format, and converted to .bin using a combination of the E+ 
weather data processor and EPW conversion tool available on the DOE-2 
Website <http://doe2.com/index_Wth.html#eQ_WthProc>.  However, although 
a great deal (a FREE service), in my experience, this data can have gaps 
that are too large to fill with the algorithms NREL prescribes, which 
then leads you to either piecing this together w/ some other data 
source, or, only evaluating the model performance over the periods you 
have data for.  For many of my projects, I need a complete year or more, 
so the E+ method was not ideal.

I recently created some DOE-2 .bin weather files using the following 
approach, using data formatting/calculation procedures automated in 
MATLAB, and then the "DOEWth.exe" utility (an older, command line 
program also available from DOE-2.com) to generate a .bin weather file.  
Once automated, this process can be completed in a relatively short 
period of time. The following is a brief explanation of the process I 
used that may give you some ideas:

1)  Downloaded NOAA data (Integrated Surface Data) for closest site.

2)  Cleaned data of extraneous points and filled gaps in data using NREL 
<http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/pdfs/weatherdata_guide_34303.pdf> 
filling routines.  There is usually always one or more observations 
recorded for every hour, however, in many cases one or more of the 
variables you need for the simulation weather file may not have been 
reported.

If you can obtain measured solar data for your location, skip steps 3-5

3)  Used the Zhang-Huang solar model (discussed in the E+ engineering 
manual) to estimate total horizontal solar radiation with custom model 
parameters developed using least-squares regression to TMY3 data.  In 
this case, I assumed TMY data was more or less "true", however, for one 
station data I worked with, I noticed some cloud cover observations did 
not appear to be consistent the reported solar radiation data.  However, 
the custom coefficients yeilded better results than the default 
coefficients reported in the E+ literature when I compared the model 
output to a short sample of actual measured solar radiation data I had.

4)  Used another model to determine the diffuse solar radiation 
component from the total global radiation.  In my case, I used a custom 
model developed for the Pacific NW (published in a thesis) however, 
there are many similar models developed from various datasets.  Orgill 
and Hollands is a popular model, although they are all very similar.

5) Once you have the two solar components above, direct normal solar 
radiation can be readily calculated.

6) With all of the necessary data now assembled, format into the TMY2 
format for processing into a .bin file using the DOEWth utility.  Using 
the DOEWth output summary file and a weather file plotting program, like 
D-View, you can "inspect" the measured data to make sure it matches what 
you expect and aligns with daily or month averages more readily available.

A few notes:
- The DOEWth utilty does have format methods that will calculate solar 
data, however, I choose to pre-process the solar data using the solar 
radiation models I preferred, which leads you to using the TMY2 format 
method.
- I did not calculate illuminance data since my project did not include 
daylighting controls.  There are models available for calculating 
illuminance, and the DOE-2 program may use a model to estimate it from 
solar radiation data (need to brush up on this section of the engineers 
manual to confirm this).
-  Related to the above comment, there are many different models out 
there for calculating solar radiation/illuminance data from other 
measured parameters. I choose the above because I felt like the models 
best captured the variables that I thought were important, and to  
lesser degree, I could readily implement them in my programming.  Other 
than comparing these models to actual TMY data, I have not rigorously 
compared these model to others available, so you may want to explore 
others.
- For any source of weather data you pursue, I would emphasize reviewing 
how data is filled and non-measured variables are calculated (i.e. what 
models were used).

I just realized this post may use the word "model" a record number of 
times, but hope you find it useful.

Dear all,

I was trying to simulate spatial comfort levels in a fully glazed

getting any significant changes with different glazing options. Can anyone
please suggest me if there is any software tool which gives better results?

The purpose of the ECB method is to show pass/fail compliance with 90.1 due to trade-off within the building - for example where a prescriptive measure couldn't be met.  The answer is that the proposed design uses less (or more) energy cost than the base.

Appendix G is intended to provide a percentage improvement over a wide range.  It is designed to provide a comparison against a "standard baseline" instead of ECB which is intended for trade-offs within what might largely be a prescriptive compliance option.

Obviously there are many similarities between the two and some chance for overlap.  But think Appendix G for demonstrating performance, and ECB for code compliance, knowing the procedures for each are tweaked to be more effective for the respective goal.

Kevin,
Ecotect's Thermal Model is very simplified and has some validation issues. I frequently use Ecotect for solar analysis and shading calculations, but I find Energy Plus or TAS are much more suitable for thermal calculations. Unfortunately, I've yet to hear of anyone successfully using Ecotect for thermal calculations.
Best,

Hi Aaron,
 
Building your own weather file can be difficult and tedious, especially gathering the appropriate solar data. Here are a couple alternatives that may be appropriate depending on the specific context of your project:
 
1 - Compare the heating and cooling degree days between your performance period and the TMY weather. If you have multiple years of utility data and associated weather data, the weather variations each year might average out to be very similar to the TMY. If they are moderately different, you could attempt to adjust modeling results based on this difference?
2 - If you create a custom weather file for a short performance period (e.g. one year or less) and tune your model to the utility data from that period, then your results are only applicable to performance during that period. Maybe that's what you want. A different way to look at it would be to generalize the results to a typical year (i.e. the TMY weather). One method is to develop regression fits of measured energy use as a function of outside air temperature. For example, graph hourly hot water use against measured hourly outside air temperature and do a curve fit. The relationship is generally linear but perhaps with a change-point (where the slope changes). With the regressions, you can apply these relationships to the weather data in the TMY file to generalize the measured energy use to energy use during a typical year. Thus, calibrating a TMY-based energy model to the normalized baseline would be an apples to apples comparison and the results would be generalized to typical conditions rather than just the specific conditions during your performance period. There's more to it, but that's the general gist. 

Also, there was a great spreadsheet tool that was shared on bldg-sim a couple years ago that used macros to automatically gather and compile actual (hourly or even sub-hourly) weather data from weather stations on www.wunderground.com. But no solar data. I use this tool exclusively now for gathering real weather data. 
 
Good luck,
Hwakong

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] historic weather files for model calibration


Aaron- 

The question "are model results significantly impacted by the difference between historic weather data and performance-period data" is a complex one, however, here is an approach that may be helpful if you need to construct your own custom weather file.

You can purchase historical weather data available from NOAA station data from the NCDC.  However, these data sets do not include solar radiation data and often need some QC work (remove extraneous observations, fill gaps, etc).  In the past, I have also downloaded weather data from the EnergyPlus site in IWEC format, and converted to .bin using a combination of the E+ weather data processor and EPW conversion tool available on the DOE-2 Website.  However, although a great deal (a FREE service), in my experience, this data can have gaps that are too large to fill with the algorithms NREL prescribes, which then leads you to either piecing this together w/ some other data source, or, only evaluating the model performance over the periods you have data for.  For many of my projects, I need a complete year or more, so the E+ method was not ideal.

I recently created some DOE-2 .bin weather files using the following approach, using data formatting/calculation procedures automated in MATLAB, and then the "DOEWth.exe" utility (an older, command line program also available from DOE-2.com) to generate a .bin weather file.  Once automated, this process can be completed in a relatively short period of time. The following is a brief explanation of the process I used that may give you some ideas:

1)  Downloaded NOAA data (Integrated Surface Data) for closest site.

2)  Cleaned data of extraneous points and filled gaps in data using NREL filling routines.  There is usually always one or more observations recorded for every hour, however, in many cases one or more of the variables you need for the simulation weather file may not have been reported.  

If you can obtain measured solar data for your location, skip steps 3-5

3)  Used the Zhang-Huang solar model (discussed in the E+ engineering manual) to estimate total horizontal solar radiation with custom model parameters developed using least-squares regression to TMY3 data.  In this case, I assumed TMY data was more or less "true", however, for one station data I worked with, I noticed some cloud cover observations did not appear to be consistent the reported solar radiation data.  However, the custom coefficients yeilded better results than the default coefficients reported in the E+ literature when I compared the model output to a short sample of actual measured solar radiation data I had.  

4)  Used another model to determine the diffuse solar radiation component from the total global radiation.  In my case, I used a custom model developed for the Pacific NW (published in a thesis) however, there are many similar models developed from various datasets.  Orgill and Hollands is a popular model, although they are all very similar.

5) Once you have the two solar components above, direct normal solar radiation can be readily calculated.

6) With all of the necessary data now assembled, format into the TMY2 format for processing into a .bin file using the DOEWth utility.  Using the DOEWth output summary file and a weather file plotting program, like D-View, you can "inspect" the measured data to make sure it matches what you expect and aligns with daily or month averages more readily available.

A few notes:
- The DOEWth utilty does have format methods that will calculate solar data, however, I choose to pre-process the solar data using the solar radiation models I preferred, which leads you to using the TMY2 format method.
- I did not calculate illuminance data since my project did not include daylighting controls.  There are models available for calculating illuminance, and the DOE-2 program may use a model to estimate it from solar radiation data (need to brush up on this section of the engineers manual to confirm this). 
-  Related to the above comment, there are many different models out there for calculating solar radiation/illuminance data from other measured parameters. I choose the above because I felt like the models best captured the variables that I thought were important, and to  lesser degree, I could readily implement them in my programming.  Other than comparing these models to actual TMY data, I have not rigorously compared these model to others available, so you may want to explore others.  
- For any source of weather data you pursue, I would emphasize reviewing how data is filled and non-measured variables are calculated (i.e. what models were used).  

I just realized this post may use the word "model" a record number of times, but hope you find it useful.

This raises the question for me - are model results significantly impacted by the difference between historic weather data and performance-period data?
 
When I?m engaged in Measurement and Verification, I can install a weather station that records data for performance period to allow for calibration. (http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/Publications/BuildingSimulation2009.GundHallModel.pdf)
 
But for an investment-grade energy audit with historic bills, I?m not sure where to turn for all the variables needed to construct a weather file.
 
Anyone on this list have a recommendation?
