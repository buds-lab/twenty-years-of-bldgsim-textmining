Archsim EnergyPlus Modeling for Rhino3D
Fri, Sep 11, 2015 at 12:30 PM - 2:00 PM EDT


Register at https://attendee.gototraining.com/r/5658271921379017474


Attendees will learn to use Archsim Energy Modeling, a plugin that brings
fully featured EnergyPlus simulations to Rhino/Grasshopper and thus links
the EnergyPlus simulation engine with a powerful parametric design and CAD
modeling environment.

Archsim allows you to effortlessly create complex multi-zone energy models,
simulate them and visualize results without ever switching between tools.
Archsim supports advanced daylighting and shading controls, ventilation
modules such as wind and stack natural ventilation, airflow-networks,
simple HVAC, photovoltaics and phase changing materials. It is typically
used for rapid early design exploration where building shape, window to
wall ratios, facade and glazing systems and passive approaches such as
shading and natural ventilation potential are tested for their impact on
the building environmental performance and comfort. Simulation inputs such
as model geometry, materiality, constructions and zone usage profiles are
fully parametric and can be coupled with optimization algorithms within
Grasshopper.

At the risk of sounding simplistic - if you are looking for the split from a weather file - couldn't you just use Excel?

I'm looking for a simple tool (preferably free!) to estimate an approximate split of hourly global solar irradiance into direct and diffuse components.

Any suggestions?

Thanks!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] achievable accuracy of EnergyPlus or similar programs
Message-ID: <CAOOnEfiFg8Zrv4MGVVjLLME8aJUTWPz9oLAbcDvViO+mxaXLOw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear colleagues,
1. Do you know the maximum number of variables/parameters that could
be applied in EnergyPlus?
2.May be you have got any information about the preliminary calculated
accuracy (uncertainty/error of, for example, room temperature) of this
program?
Human intuition and experience suggest the simple, at first glance, truth. For
a small number of variables, the researcher gets a very rough picture of
the process being studied. In turn, the huge amount of accounted variables
allows deeply and thoroughly to understand the structure of the phenomenon.
However, with the apparent attractiveness, each variable brings its own
error in the integral (theoretical or experimental) error of
model/experiment. Therefore, would seem, must be some optimal/rational
number of variables specific to each of the studied processes.
Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
Best regards
Boris M. Menin PhD, MSc.

I'm working on an energy audit for a building with old window A/C units.  The average age is about 15 years old. Does anybody know where I can find a good estimate for the efficiency of a 15 year old unit?

I know there is a wide range of efficiencies, then and now, depending on how much you are willing to pay. I'm looking something I can reference and file in my report to show where I got my numbers.

I have a little older than that. This figure is from

An Introduction to OpenFOAM and High Performance Computing
8th June 2015- School of Civil and Building Engineering, Loughborough University
The OpenFOAM? (Open Field Operation and Manipulation) CFD Toolbox is a free, open source CFD software package which has a large user base across most areas of engineering and science, from both commercial and academic organisations. OpenFOAM has an extensive range of features to solve anything from complex fluid flows involving chemical reactions, turbulence and heat transfer, to solid dynamics and electromagnetics. It includes tools for meshing, notably snappyHexMesh, a parallelised mesher for complex CAD geometries, and for pre- and post-processing. Almost everything (including meshing, and pre- and post-processing) runs in parallel as standard, enabling users to take full advantage of high performance computing facilities (HPCs).
This seminar provides a glimpse into the world of OpenFOAM and HPC and is intended to demonstrate the capabilities of OpenFOAM as well as offering advice on getting started to those who have never used OpenFOAM. The cost of this seminar is free but numbers are strictly limited. To book a place, please email Jackie Overton (J.Overton at lboro.ac.uk<mailto:J.Overton at lboro.ac.uk>).

I'm working on an energy audit for a building with old window A/C units.  The average age is about 15 years old. Does anybody know where I can find a good estimate for the efficiency of a 15 year old unit?

I know there is a wide range of efficiencies, then and now, depending on how much you are willing to pay. I'm looking something I can reference and file in my report to show where I got my numbers.

This is a great place to start.  The 15 year old units certainly won't
be *better
*than these values.

I wonder how much *worse *they might be due to poor installation, corroded
and clogged evaporator and condensing coils and other wear and tear? 20%?
30%?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Swimming pool lighting with 90.1
Message-ID: <21BFCB111AFBDC46955BE94E5F37681E0EC1DA4D23@HUARD.intranet.MRN.GOUV>

Hello,

I have two concrete cases where I'm embarrassed regarding lighting in a swimming pool with 90.1.
Case 1 : A swimming pool building (the building  is a swimming pool)
In the lighting section of 90.1, the Building Area Method (9.5) has no building area type corresponding specifically to a swimming pool. My guess would be to choose the "Gymnasium" because as a swimming pool, there is high ceiling and locker room.

Using the Building Area Method, is the "Gymnasium" a correct assumption for a swimming pool building ?

Case 2 : A swimming pool in a residential building
  Assuming that the "multifamily"'s LPD doesn't allow me to  comply to the Building Area Method, and I decide to choose the space by space method. My guess would be to choose a building-specific space type in the list "Sport Arena", but I'm block by these unanswered question<http://energy-models.com/forum/energy-modeling-software/trace-700/leed-and-ashrae-901/lighting-power-density-space-space-meth> : what is the meaning of the class ? :

?         Court sport arena - class 4

?         Court sport arena - class 2

?         Court sport arena - class 1

Using the Space by Space Method, what would be the best building-specific space type for the area dedicated to the pool ?


Thanks,

Julien

Hi Julien,



For either case, and even if the pools are interior to the building, I
would consider citing ?Lighting for swimming pools and water features? is
under the exempted list for exterior lighting power calculations under
90.1-2010, and more broadly ?athletic playing areas? under 90.1-2007.



Evoking that exception, you could

A)     have the baseline match the proposed (for a PRM model),

B)      omit that lighting power entirely (for demonstrating prescriptive
compliance), or else

C)      the stage is then set for you to differentiate from the baseline by
demonstrating how your design saves energy relative to ?standard? pool
lighting by way of separate/exceptional calculations.



If you want to wrap into your interior LPD regardless,

1.       Gymnasium/Sports Arena/Exercise Center seem to be the likely
candidates for BAM.

2.       Class I through Class IV comes from IESNA Handbook/RP-6, and is
used to differentiate illuminance recommendations based upon the degree of
competition (ranging from professional/national at Class I down to
amateur/recreational at class IV).  I?d suggest having your lighting
designer determine which set of illumination recommendations best matches
the photometric calculations for pool surface/deck surface illumination.

Hi Nick,

The question was for a demonstrating prescriptive compliance.
Thanks for your quick and detailed answer  (I?m really surprised that we could invoke an outdoor lighting exception for an interior lighting!)

Hi Julien,

For either case, and even if the pools are interior to the building, I would consider citing ?Lighting for swimming pools and water features? is under the exempted list for exterior lighting power calculations under 90.1-2010, and more broadly ?athletic playing areas? under 90.1-2007.

Evoking that exception, you could

A)     have the baseline match the proposed (for a PRM model),

B)      omit that lighting power entirely (for demonstrating prescriptive compliance), or else

C)      the stage is then set for you to differentiate from the baseline by demonstrating how your design saves energy relative to ?standard? pool lighting by way of separate/exceptional calculations.

If you want to wrap into your interior LPD regardless,

1.       Gymnasium/Sports Arena/Exercise Center seem to be the likely candidates for BAM.

2.       Class I through Class IV comes from IESNA Handbook/RP-6, and is used to differentiate illuminance recommendations based upon the degree of competition (ranging from professional/national at Class I down to amateur/recreational at class IV).  I?d suggest having your lighting designer determine which set of illumination recommendations best matches the photometric calculations for pool surface/deck surface illumination.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Swimming pool lighting with 90.1

Hello,

I have two concrete cases where I?m embarrassed regarding lighting in a swimming pool with 90.1.

Case 1 : A swimming pool building (the building  is a swimming pool)
In the lighting section of 90.1, the Building Area Method (9.5) has no building area type corresponding specifically to a swimming pool. My guess would be to choose the ?Gymnasium? because as a swimming pool, there is high ceiling and locker room.

Using the Building Area Method, is the ?Gymnasium? a correct assumption for a swimming pool building ?

Case 2 : A swimming pool in a residential building
  Assuming that the ?multifamily??s LPD doesn?t allow me to  comply to the Building Area Method, and I decide to choose the space by space method. My guess would be to choose a building-specific space type in the list ?Sport Arena?, but I?m block by these unanswered question<http://energy-models.com/forum/energy-modeling-software/trace-700/leed-and-ashrae-901/lighting-power-density-space-space-meth> : what is the meaning of the class ? :

Hello Julien,

 

Usually, Nick?s advice is spot on, but I have to disagree that it would be appropriate to apply an exception for exterior lighting to an indoor pool. I expect the exclusion for outdoor playing fields, etc relates to light pollution limitations, allowing player safety to supersede the restrictions. This would be akin to using the parking garage and parking lot lighting to be sued interchangeably. Keep in mind that exterior lighting is a mandatory provision and interior lighting is a prescriptive measure ? apples and oranges. I think you are on the right track with the gymnasium alternatives. Section 3 includes specific definitions for interior versus exterior spaces and that should be what determines whether you use Table 9.4.5 or 9.5.1/9.6.1.

 

Just my 2 cents J

Former lighting designer here.

You should use the "gymnasium" number, and use a space by space calc.  If
you think about it, a natatorium is the same space size/volume and
occupancy as a gym, with similar footcandle requirements for both
recreation and competition.  I have successfully used this on many LEED
EAc1 submittals.  Electrical engineers for these projects use the gymnasium
number for COMCheck as well.  It's definitely the norm.

Good luck!
Elizabeth

Dominique,
ASHRAE climate zones are defined at the county level in the U.S., as shown in Table B-1 of Standard 90.1. Since ZIP codes can cross county lines, it would be problematic to create a file to match climate zones with ZIP codes.

Cam and Elizabeth are right, I did not pick up with certainty in my first
reading that both cases were indoor, so I figured it might be appropriate
to point out pools are more explicitly addressed on the exterior side of
things.



With the understanding the pools are definitely located in interior spaces,
you?re definitely going to be safer sticking to the indoor approaches if
that produces acceptable results.



Space-by-space is naturally likely to produce better results if you can
justify any of the higher Class LPD?s.

Former lighting designer here.



You should use the "gymnasium" number, and use a space by space calc.  If
you think about it, a natatorium is the same space size/volume and
occupancy as a gym, with similar footcandle requirements for both
recreation and competition.  I have successfully used this on many LEED
EAc1 submittals.  Electrical engineers for these projects use the gymnasium
number for COMCheck as well.  It's definitely the norm.



Good luck!

Hello Julien,



Usually, Nick?s advice is spot on, but I have to disagree that it would be
appropriate to apply an exception for exterior lighting to an indoor pool.
I expect the exclusion for outdoor playing fields, etc relates to light
pollution limitations, allowing player safety to supersede the
restrictions. This would be akin to using the parking garage and parking
lot lighting to be sued interchangeably. Keep in mind that exterior
lighting is a mandatory provision and interior lighting is a prescriptive
measure ? apples and oranges. I think you are on the right track with the
gymnasium alternatives. Section 3 includes specific definitions for
interior versus exterior spaces and that should be what determines whether
you use Table 9.4.5 or 9.5.1/9.6.1.

Hi Nick,



The question was for a demonstrating prescriptive compliance.

Thanks for your quick and detailed answer  (I?m really surprised that we
could invoke an outdoor lighting exception for an interior lighting!)

Hi Julien,



For either case, and even if the pools are interior to the building, I
would consider citing ?Lighting for swimming pools and water features? is
under the exempted list for exterior lighting power calculations under
90.1-2010, and more broadly ?athletic playing areas? under 90.1-2007.



Evoking that exception, you could

A)     have the baseline match the proposed (for a PRM model),

B)      omit that lighting power entirely (for demonstrating prescriptive
compliance), or else

C)      the stage is then set for you to differentiate from the baseline by
demonstrating how your design saves energy relative to ?standard? pool
lighting by way of separate/exceptional calculations.



If you want to wrap into your interior LPD regardless,

1.       Gymnasium/Sports Arena/Exercise Center seem to be the likely
candidates for BAM.

2.       Class I through Class IV comes from IESNA Handbook/RP-6, and is
used to differentiate illuminance recommendations based upon the degree of
competition (ranging from professional/national at Class I down to
amateur/recreational at class IV).  I?d suggest having your lighting
designer determine which set of illumination recommendations best matches
the photometric calculations for pool surface/deck surface illumination.

Hello,



I have two concrete cases where I?m embarrassed regarding lighting in a
swimming pool with 90.1.



*Case 1 : A swimming pool building (the building  is a swimming pool)*

In the lighting section of 90.1, the Building Area Method (9.5) has no
building area type corresponding specifically to a swimming pool. My guess
would be to choose the ?Gymnasium? because as a swimming pool, there is
high ceiling and locker room.



Using the Building Area Method, is the ?Gymnasium? a correct assumption for
a swimming pool building ?



*Case 2 : A swimming pool in a residential building*

  Assuming that the ?multifamily??s LPD doesn?t allow me to  comply to the
Building Area Method, and I decide to choose the space by space method. My
guess would be to choose a building-specific space type in the list ?Sport
Arena?, but I?m block by these unanswered question
<http://energy-models.com/forum/energy-modeling-software/trace-700/leed-and-ashrae-901/lighting-power-density-space-space-meth>
: what is the meaning of the class ? :

?         Court sport arena ? class 4

?         Court sport arena ? class 2

?         Court sport arena ? class 1



Using the Space by Space Method, what would be the best building-specific
space type for the area dedicated to the pool ?





Thanks,



Julien

What I have typically done for outdoor pools under 2007 is classify the
entire pool and deck as "plaza/special feature".  That usually seems to be
more than enough, and I can usually claim a bit of savings too.  But Nick's
approach also seems very reasonable; you could certainly call it exempt as
an athletic playing field, especially if you have a lap pool.  That seems
to be supported by the language in 2010.

Have you looked at what Bob Fassbender has done at http://energy-models.com/tools/climatezoner ?


Before: Find the location of your project and Google it to get the county. Then, get out ASHRAE 90.1-2007, tediously look up climate zone. Get paper cut.

Now: Get your LEED Climate Zone in one step! Use the Energy Models ClimateZoner? and avoid paper cuts.

All you need is an address OR city, or both, plus the state, or just a zip code.

Dominique,
ASHRAE climate zones are defined at the county level in the U.S., as shown in Table B-1 of Standard 90.1. Since ZIP codes can cross county lines, it would be problematic to create a file to match climate zones with ZIP codes.

I've conducted about an hour web search looking for a simple csv or Excel file that maps ASHRAE climate zones to ZIP Codes, without success. I'm wondering if someone has come across such a file?

Thank you in advance for your help.

Dominique,
I also undertook the same quest about a year and a half ago when I discovered (from speaking to some ASHRAE and DOE folks) that climate zones in the US are assigned by county.  ASHRAE Standard 169 sets climate zones based on historical weather patterns but they are assigned by county.

I came up with approximately 3,200 counties and 33,120 zip codes in the US (it depends on what US territories you?re counting).  Unfortunately there are many zip codes that straddle more than one county so it?s not a direct translation.  I counted 1,413 zip codes in the US that overlap counties with different climate zones (see attached pivot table).  So this makes looking up climate zone by zip code challenging if the project is located near a climate transition region.

You may be aware, but the ASHRAE climate zones are changing a bit as of the publication of 169-2013.  I?m not aware of any published ASHRAE standards that have adopted the 2013 climate zones but the change will come in the next couple of years.  The climate zone changes did not make it into 90.1-2013 but my understanding is that they will by the time 2016 is published (I know there are SSPC 90.1 people on this list, has this reference been adopted yet?).  So the 169-2006 climate zone assignments are likely the ones that you?re familiar with.  I?ve attached both county assignment lists in case you?re interested.

Also, I?m not sure if you?re interested in California and Title 24, but California assigns specific state climate zones by zip code.  I?ve included these assignments in an attachment as well.  There are 1,702 counties in California according to the CEC I found.

Be aware when dealing with counties: if you want to turn these into lookups or pulldowns, the naming conventions (i.e. spelling and punctuation) between US federal census data and climate zone data are not entirely perfect and may require some cleaning up.  Things as simple as which letters are capitalized or whether compound names have a dash can case issues.

I hope this is helpful, good luck!

All,

As Scott points out, zip code translation to climate zone is essentially
impossible to do with complete accuracy.

A couple of additional points

1. Zip code definitions can change. ?The USPS defines zip codes for its
   purposes and those do not include climate zone definitions. ?I know
   this because at my former address, the zip code was modified. ?Don't
   know how common this is, but it happens.

2. To my knowledge, the California climate zones are NOT defined in
   terms of zip codes. ?There is a legal definition based on counties
   and/or jurisdictions. ?The California Energy Commission staff created
   a zip code lookup for convenience. ?I believe their lookup is not
   perfect, for all the same reasons.

Message-ID: <CY1PR12MB0457BCD1B058BF4661A2C3CDAEB20@CY1PR12MB0457.namprd12.prod.outlook.com>

Good morning, all,

Do any of you know why the U-values in Appendix A of ASHRAE 90.1-2013 (Table A2.3.3) for a metal building roof are different than those in the 2010 edition (Table A2.3)? In 90.1-2013 they no longer match the U-values in the tables in Chapter 5 for the given insulation system. The same is true for metal building walls. Did they change what is included in the assembly, like film coefficients, or calculate thermal bridging differently? If so, why didn't the assembly values in Chapter 5 change? Any insights would be appreciated. I didn't find any errata for this on ASHRAE's website.

Thanks,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Radiance and Open studio
Message-ID: <CACj692G+cvJBX6WuS9DdgxtA4M4Kc8KcPAYfd_LyFtmZBH2irA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear colleagues,

I am just starting to use Radiance on Windows, I did the basic course on
Linux before (or on the virtual machine on Windows) and used Open studio
plugin for energy plus models.

I am working with Open studio 1.7.0. and have installed Radiance 5.0 on
windows. I have created the simple model in Sketchup and inserted the
illuminance map, glare sensor and daylighting control in the thermal zone.

Nevertheless, during the daylight simulation Open studio does not seem to
detect the certain file "expandobjects 8.2." (the full error list is
attached). Even though I performed "Scan for tools" operation.

On the open studio forum "unmet hours" people seem to report similar
problems, but it was promised to be solved in 1.7 version... Also it was
said that Open studio somehow is only able to locate Energy plus when it is
installed in the default folder. But it has nothing to do with Radiance,
right?..

Has anyone experienced something similar?
Is there any better way to use Radiance on Windows apart from Open studio?

My .OSM model is attached.

Thank you in advance!

Hi Anna,

I have seen people report success when they reinstall EnergyPlus after the OpenStudio installation.

There was a similar comment regarding Radiance alternatives on Unmet Hours recently, and I'll repost my response to that here:

The Radiance functionality in OpenStudio is constantly improving, and indeed we have a lot planned for the fall release. That said, other options for using Radiance to evaluate daylighting abound, with Daysim, Honeybee, SPOT and LightStanza coming to mind. I would selfishly point out that technically all of these options are "limited" in one way or another; OpenStudio focuses on whole building integration of daylighting results, and does that the best of all the options, while being limited in other ways (which we are working on rectifying).

Dear colleagues,

I am working with Open studio 1.7.0. and have installed Radiance 5.0 on windows. I have created the simple model in Sketchup and inserted the illuminance map, glare sensor and daylighting control in the thermal zone.

Nevertheless, during the daylight simulation Open studio does not seem to detect the certain file "expandobjects 8.2." (the full error list is attached). Even though I performed "Scan for tools" operation.

On the open studio forum "unmet hours" people seem to report similar problems, but it was promised to be solved in 1.7 version... Also it was said that Open studio somehow is only able to locate Energy plus when it is installed in the default folder. But it has nothing to do with Radiance, right?..

Has anyone experienced something similar?
Is there any better way to use Radiance on Windows apart from Open studio?

My .OSM model is attached.

Thank you in advance!

Dear Anna,



If you are comfortable using Rhino, check out DIVA (http://diva4rhino.com) as well. We have tutorials and exercises for download here http://web.mit.edu/sustainabledesignlab/projects/DaylightingHandbook/resources.htm   with more coming within the coming 2 weeks. Our next DIVA training near you will be in London at the Architecture Association on Oct 22-24 before and after DIVA DAY 2015 (http://diva4rhino.com/diva-day-2015).



Rob, to my knowledge DIVA was the first and remains the only tool supporting LEED v4 daylighting credit analysis including blinds use at the whole building level. I am of course happy to learn otherwise.

Hi Christoph,

Apologies, when I said "Daysim" in my head of course I was saying "DIVA". We regret the omission.

OpenStudio does not perform sDA and ASE calculations, however it does do all the other common daylight metrics, _including blinds_, and seamlessly merges the electric lighting results with a whole building energy model. It is this latter point that I hang my hat on. We chose to focus on the whole building integration aspect to the detriment of newer metrics and better interfaces for data visualization. It's a process...

MOISTURE ANALYSIS 101
FOR BUILDING ENVELOPES

Live Webinar Workshop
August 14th at 12:30 p.m. ET

DESCRIPTION
Modern buildings typically contain envelope systems that require specific
layers to control condensation due to moisture migration and/or air
leakage, dedicated waterproofing systems to protect moisture-sensitive
backup materials (e.g., wood and gypsum-based products), and thermal
insulation to control heat losses and gains. Consequently, building codes
include provisions for these systems in new construction, and in some
cases, renovation projects. As such, architecture and consulting firms
frequently turn to hygrothermal modeling to determine the optimal
arrangement of these layers. This presentation will introduce the
parameters to consider when setting up a model, and through several project
examples, demonstrate how hygrothermal modeling can be used to develop
assemblies with a low risk for moisture-related problems. Also, critical to
the process, we will touch on some of the limitations and assumptions made
when developing a hygrothermal model.

ABOUT THE SPEAKER
Cheryl Saldanha, PE is a senior engineer with with Simpson Gumpertz & Heger
Inc. in New York City. Cheryl specializes in building science and
building-envelope performance, including the simulation of heat, air, and
moisture migration through assemblies. She investigates building enclosure
and mechanical system failures, and designs remedial repairs.

Thank you for your replies!

Christoph,

I am more than comfortable with Rhino, sice my background is in
architecture, but at the small engineering company where I am working now
they do not use this tool. My task was to demonstrate and (maybe) introduce
Energy Plus and Radiance to the comapy's routine. As for energy plus,
additionally to compare it with the local competitor in Austria from
Pokorny tec (http://www.pokorny-tec.at/). If one can call the commercial
software a "competitor" to the non-commercial...

Robert,

following your advice, I installed Energy plus into the default folder and
located it again via "scan for tools". This way I only managed to get rid
of the minor error (URL Found in IDF:
file:files/AUT_Vienna.Schwechat.110360_IWEC.epw but no source could be
located.) I call it minor because I saw it appearing in the error list in
the tutorial, where the rest of the functions were working.

as for the
The job in
'C:/Users/labor/AppData/Local/Temp/OpenStudio.wh4932/resources/run/1-Ruby-0/in/model/radiance/gen_eplus/2-ExpandObjects-0'
did not finish successfully.

ERROR: No tool matching: expandobjects 8.2.-.-


and

failed to run ModelToRad


it is still there. See the report attached.


I will duplicate my comment to the Unmet hours forum as well.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modelling groundwater cooling via concrete slab
Message-ID: <CAHHNs40LLOD9YxuuLAHHxk7oXiTA5B-5972Nc2ouCRRdseSxKA@mail.gmail.com>

I'm looking for the most suitable approach for modelling groundwater
cooling in a thermal model. It's proposed to have pipes embedded in a
concrete ceiling with groundwater flowing through them. The groundwater
supply temp will be fixed at around 12degC.


I'm using IES software but I expect the possible approaches would be
similar with most packages.


I could either use a simplified approach calculating the cooling capacity
from the flow rate and temperature difference, or use a detailed systems
modelling approach. I want something fairly quick but reasonably accurate
(don't we all?!) as it's a preliminary study.

I would use the chilled ceiling room units and connect them chilled water loop supplying the constant temperature, but set the chiller fuel code to none and zero out any heat rejection energy such as cooling tower or condenser fans.  System 9g would be a good start since it can be used for ventilation and has the room units already assigned.  The only thing you won?t see is the thermal mass effects of the slab.  The chilled ceiling is really to model just a panel.  For an early study, I wouldn?t go through the trouble of trying to get the slab right as it requires much more effort.

Claire,

Cory provided a good description of the best approach and made a good point that, for an early study, it will probably be best and very fast to use the ?chilled ceiling? panel mode in IES-VE ApacheHVAC---especially considering you?re modeling a hydronic ceiling slab, rather than an exposed floor.

As you?re attempting to represent a massive hydronic concrete slab, you can enter an appropriate value for the mass of the slab in the ?Weight of chilled panel (excluding water)? parameter in the ?chilled ceiling? type dialog. This will provide representation of thermal inertia (capacitance) suitable for a quick early study. It will also provide modeling of radiant exchange between other room surfaces and this massive ceiling ?panel?.

You can quickly set up a generic ?chilled ceiling? panel type with a suitably conservative maximum cooling capacity. For use in zones of different floor areas, and thus differing cooling capacities, you can multiply the number of panels within the controller dialog as needed to represent realistic cooling capacities for each floor area. The cooling capacity will also be constrained during simulation by the flow rate you set in the controller dialog and the moderate supply water temperature from the CHWL representing your ground water supply.

The main benefit of setting up the full hydronic slab model, as detailed in the ApacheHVAC user guide appendix on this, is that you can very accurately model the effects of slab mass and u-value of the average path between the water in the hydronic tubes and the surface of the slab, response time, radiant exchanges with other surfaces in the zone, and direct-solar gains received by the floor slab surface if this were exposed to the space above in any part of the building (may not be important in your case, if the cooled slab is only every exposed as a ceiling, and not a floor).

As the quick panel-based model will limit cooling capacity as a function of water flow rate and temperature, but does not have a way to actually model the limiting effects of the tube spacing and depth within the concrete, it will be important to appropriately constrain the cooling capacity either by the flow rate control setting and/or the maximum capacity entered in the panel type dialog. There are numerous papers published on the topic, and the CBE paper at the following link summarizes the conclusions from many of them including (on page 3) cooling capacity on the order of 77 W/m2 for chilled concrete slabs (excluding any contribution from ventilation systems) with moderate SWT and surface temperature held more or less constant:

http://escholarship.org/uc/item/3j52t8vz#page-3

That and the many publications it cites might give you a better idea of appropriate maximum cooling capacity of your particular hydronic slab design and water temperature.

Cheers,
Timothy

System 9g would be a good start since it can be used for ventilation and has the room units already assigned.  The only thing you won?t see is the thermal mass effects of the slab.  The chilled ceiling is really to model just a panel.  For an early study, I wouldn?t go through the trouble of trying to get the slab right as it requires much more effort.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modelling groundwater cooling via concrete slab

I'm looking for the most suitable approach for modelling groundwater cooling in a thermal model. It's proposed to have pipes embedded in a concrete ceiling with groundwater flowing through them. The groundwater supply temp will be fixed at around 12degC.

I'm using IES software but I expect the possible approaches would be similar with most packages.

I could either use a simplified approach calculating the cooling capacity from the flow rate and temperature difference, or use a detailed systems modelling approach. I want something fairly quick but reasonably accurate (don't we all?!) as it's a preliminary study.

Thanks,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] SPOT Pro released!
Message-ID: <CAAP856xZpEgtN=BqJx_2kkQJtEBCmOrpY=2=fzNVCE_nmM1HKg@mail.gmail.com>

Fellow building simulationists,

A new version of the Sensor Placement + Optimization Tool daylighting
software, SPOT Pro, is now available.  Visit SPOT home
<http://www.daylightinginnovations.com/spot-home>

to learn more about it and download the software.

SPOT Pro is a Windows-based stand-alone interface to the Radiance
ray-tracing engine that sits, accessible, behind the scenes.  SPOT Pro has
a number of unique simulation capabilities:

   - *Optical daylighting system annual simulation* - SPOT uses "system
   BSDF" files to describe these optical or complex fenestration systems and
   perform annual simulation.
   - *Shade control simulation* - both automated/photosensor-based control
   and a range of manual shade control algorithms are available
   - *Annual metric reports* - compare various daylighting metrics with
   standard daylighting reports for LEED (v4, 2009, v2.1), CHPS and a SPOT
   performance report.
   - *"Design Day" calculations* - results showing average "design day"
   conditions (calibrated to climate data) rather than a specific weather
   condition in an hourly weather file.
   - *Simulation of photosensor systems* - SPOT simulates the actual
   photosensor system response, lets you refine the control system settings,
   and provides an annual simulation of the interaction between electric
   lighting and daylighting.  For those aiming for truly accurate
   simulation of the interaction between daylighting and electric lighting,
   this may be the only tool that does not use workplane illuminance (an
   average or a point) as a proxy for the photosensor signals, and that
   accounts for the interaction of electric light feedback on common
   closed-loop control systems.
   - *Output to DOE-2 and EnergyPlus* - After optimization and simulation
   of the photosensor system, SPOT provides annual LPD multiplier schedule
   output files for both DOE-2 and EnergyPlus.  Direct output to HAP coming
   soon....
   - *Internal Geometry Modeler* - The internal modeling tools are fairly
   robust, with blocks, sloped ceilings, monitors, and sawtooth geometries
   available, yet still easy and quick to use with no CAD experience
   necessary.  Sketchup models can be imported into the software behind the
   scenes.
   - *Material Database and Editor * - New material database allows colors,
   patterns, glass, metals, and BSDF files to be assigned to your model's
   surfaces.
   - *Improved Renderings -* The use of materials and patterns greatly
   improve the quality of the perspective and sectional renderings.

The software is in final beta testing stages with an official v5.0 release
coming summer 2015.  Reduced price educational licenses are available and
commercial licenses bought during the final beta stage are 1/2 off and
valid for all SPOT Pro 5.X releases.  Periodic SPOT training webinars will
be held throughout 2015, the first will be held on June 18th at 10am
(MST).  E-mail spot at daylightinginnovations.com if you are interested in
joining this webinar (limited to 25 participants) or scheduling a future
SPOT webinar.

Happy Simulating!
Zack

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LBNL Seminar - Commercial Building Energy Saver
Message-ID: <CADgQ+4gLQjfpZZ2WQL8UHNZoGSObMSQLPuOm9Wt7zn-Fu3fBDg@mail.gmail.com>

You're invited to attend this Energy Technologies Area (ETA) seminar,
taking place at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory at 12:00pm
Thursday, July 2, 2015, at LBNL Bldg. 90, Room 3122.

*TITLE:* Commercial Building Energy Saver: An Energy Retrofit Analysis
Toolkit

*SPEAKER(S):* Mary Ann Piette, Tianzhen Hong, Yixing Chen, et al.

*LOCATION:*  LBNL Bldg. 90, room 3122 (in Berkeley, California)

*DATE & TIME:*  At 12:00pm, Thursday, July 2, 2015

*DESCRIPTION: *Small commercial buildings in the United States consume 47%
of the total primary energy of the buildings sector. However retrofitting
these buildings poses a huge challenge for small and medium-sized
enterprises as building owners usually lack the expertise and resources to
conduct on-site energy audit to identify and evaluate cost-effective energy
retrofit technologies. This seminar presents the Commercial Building Energy
Saver (CBES), an energy retrofit analysis toolkit, which calculates the
energy use of a building, identifies and evaluates retrofit measures in
terms of energy savings, energy cost savings and payback. The toolkit
provides a rich set of features as follows: (1) Energy Benchmarking
provides an ENERGY STAR score for the building and how it compares with
other peer buildings in California; (2) Load Shape Analysis identifies
potential building operation improvements using statistical analysis of the
building?s 15-minute interval electricity use data; (3) Preliminary
Retrofit Analysis searches a pre-simulated database for retrofit measures
based on investment criteria; and (4) the Detailed Retrofit Analysis
performs EnergyPlus simulations to evaluate energy savings of user
configurable energy conservation measures considering the actual building
characteristics and operation schedules. The CBES Toolkit includes a web
app (cbes.lbl.gov) for end users and the CBES Application Programming
Interface for integrating CBES with other energy software tools. The object
oriented software architecture of CBES enables its expansion to cover more
building types, more climates, and more building technologies in future.

*BIO:* Mary Ann Piette is the Director of the BTUS Division. She is a Staff
Scientist and the PI of the CEC sponsored CBES project. Tianzhen Hong is a
Staff Scientist and Deputy Lead of the Simulation Research Group. He is the
lead of the CBES software development. Yixing Chen is a postdoc and the
chief software developer of the CBES. Sang Hoon Lee is a Senior Scientific
Engineering Associate and the developer of the Database of Energy
Efficiency Performance (DEEP) for preliminary retrofit analysis. Rongpeng
Zhang is a postdoc and the developer of the web app for the detailed
retrofit analysis. Kaiyu Sun is a Scientific Engineering Associate and the
developer of the automatic model calibration for CBES. Sarah Taylor-Lange
is a postdoc and the coordinator of the CBES development. Phil Price is a
Staff Scientist and the developer of the load shape analysis. William Fisk
is a Senior Scientist and led the IEQ measurement task of the project.
Rengie Chan is a Research Scientist and the developer of qualitative impact
of retrofit measures on IEQ. Norman Bourassa is a Project Manager and led
the city partner demonstration task. Margarita (Gari) Kloss is a Program
Manager and the CBES project manager.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Floor heating and wall cooling in Energy plus
Message-ID: <CACj692GdCZTW2SjGWrRTi3haGf9b9wzN7AvpmcSKLFHdo9COQQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I need to model the building with the existing floor heating. The research
question is how sensible it would be to introduce the wall cooling (the ).
Is there a way to model these systems in Energy plus? What object or object
combinations should I use?

As an output for the simple HVAC systems I used "Zone Air system sensible
cooling energy"

Thank you in advance!

IBPSA-USA San Francisco Chapter welcomes you all to the June 2015 event.



This month we are excited to have Andrew Krioukov, CEO and Co-Founder of Building Robotics to present about their work on M2M technologies which is also called the "Internet of Things".



Bio:

Andrew Krioukov is the CEO and Co-Founder of Building Robotics. As a Ph.D Candidate in Computer Science at U.C. Berkeley, he worked on software infrastructure for implementing building applications at scale. He has previously worked at Intel Research, Google and IBM on energy efficiency and large-scale distributed systems. Andrew is a recipient of the 2014 Forbes 30 Under 30 award in Energy & Industry.



Synopsis:

Building Robotics is changing the way people interact with commercial buildings by developing cutting-edge software solutions that increase comfort and optimize building systems. Our main product, Comfy, is software that enables a better relationship between people and their workspaces.

Descriptions:

Presentation #1: Case studies that demonstrate innovative approaches to daylighting design.

Presentation #2: In a dense urban environment, the sun's photons encounter a dense filter composed of surrounding buildings at different points of the compass along with different massing, form and material reflectances. As a result available sun or sky daylighting resources do not follow a simple elevation-by-elevation distribution as they might on a suburban site. Given the increased 3D complexity of the light resource map, how do you then rationally allocate costly building daylighting resources like shading, electrochromic glass, and electric light dimming systems as a function of orientation and elevation? This presentation will cover preliminary results of urban daylight studies that focus on New York City and that account for both thermal liabilities and daylighting benefits.

Claire,

It sounds like you are using IES but you mention "other packages" as well so I thought I'd outline the ways that ground water cooling through hydronic slabs can be modelled in DesignBuilder EnergyPlus.

1. In DesignBuilder v4.5 there is an HVAC template which allows you to directly model this system with water from a ground borehole flowing through a HX component which cools water flowing through a second circuit into ceiling surfaces. You get the cooling injected into exactly the right part of the surface and slab thermal mass is included. You just have to load the template and set the position of the pipes in your ceiling slab construction. You can select a template with the number of boreholes or use water from a lake. For later more detailed design work you can refine the ground loop design using a third party tool such as GLD or GLHEPRO.

[cid:image003.jpg at 01D0A9A9.9A0E73F0]

Other simpler options include:

2. As suggested by others you can use a dummy chiller setting a fuel code to ignore the fuel consumption.

3. Use district cooling.

Options 2 and 3 would allow you to set a fixed 12degC for supply temperature. Option 1 would calculate the correct supply temperature based on the capacity of the ground water supply.

I hope it helps.

Andy

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modelling groundwater cooling via concrete slab

I'm looking for the most suitable approach for modelling groundwater cooling in a thermal model. It's proposed to have pipes embedded in a concrete ceiling with groundwater flowing through them. The groundwater supply temp will be fixed at around 12degC.

I'm using IES software but I expect the possible approaches would be similar with most packages.

I could either use a simplified approach calculating the cooling capacity from the flow rate and temperature difference, or use a detailed systems modelling approach. I want something fairly quick but reasonably accurate (don't we all?!) as it's a preliminary study.

Thanks,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] 90.1-2013 Interior lighting - local control signification
Message-ID: <21BFCB111AFBDC46955BE94E5F37681E0EC1DDB88B@HUARD.intranet.MRN.GOUV>

Hello,

Could sounds like stupids questions, but there's no such thing as a stupid question!
90.1 - 2013 interior lighting controls changed dramatically compare to the precedent version, not in substance but in form, I have questions about it.

Question 1)
In section 9.4.1.1(a)  Local control, does "manual lighting controls" means Manual On AND Manual Off ?

The 2013 User Manual doesn't clearly answer this question. I wonder because there are others options called "restricted to Manual ON", "Automatic full OFF",etc..  so my logic would be to called Local control "Manual ON/ Manual OFF".

Question 2) (for a 90.1-2013 compliance)
For example, suppose a unique fixture of two T8 32W installed in an 20 m2 office enclosed by ceilingheight partitions. By reading Table 9.6.1, I would installed :

-          a switch able to manual ON and manual OFF : for Local Control requirement (the manual OFF is the purpose of question 2)

-          no automatic ON : to comply either Restricted to manual ON and Restricted to Partial Automatic ON

-          a bilevel ballast and bilevel switch : for Bilevel Lighting control requirement

-          no daylight control since the installed lighting power is under 150W

-          a general lighting controller able to shutoff the light after business hour, for scheduled Shufoff option (the switch is able to override the scheduled shutoff for no more than 2hours)
Even if I have a scheduled Shufoff, does the local control requirement requires to have a Manual OFF ?
I think yes, so there will be energy savings during the business hours when the occupant leave the office and switch the light off manually, but the unclear  "manual lighting controls" of Local Control requirement make me doubt of the Manual OFF requirement...!

Dear all,

I have a query , since  i m doing simulations , i want to know which month
is the peak month in terms of load for hot and cold climate regions.

The weather data which we uses , what extract does the simulation tool

all.


It would be very helpful to me if all experts can reply and make me

Since we are working in a virtual world and not all buildings react the same way the
most straightforward approach is to run virtual epxeriments and look for periods during the
year when the building or its occupants are most-stressed.  

Might not be on the hottest day or the coldest day.  More likely it will be during a week 
with a sequence of weather and internal usage patterns for the specific building
coincide with greatest discomfort or exceptional demands for environmental controls.

Weather data gives an initial clue,  and better to confirm that this is actually the case.

When you say "peak month in terms of load", do you mean the month with the highest peak 
hourly load or the month with the largest total load ?

I need to add some caveats to Javed's response:
1) he's assuming that you're using EnergyPlus  or an EnergyPlus-based simulation program.  
If so, then the comment about looking at the DDY file makes sense.
2) the DDY file is weakly linked to the simulation weather file (EPW), and based not on 
the weather file but the design conditions table in the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals 
for the same WMO station. These design conditions are calculated as near-extreme 
conditions (0.4%, 1% for cooling, 99.6%, 99% for heating. etc.) from long-term weather 
data and have little relationship with what's in the simulation weather file. In addition, 
the DDY file contains only Annual design conditions, and the only information on monthly 
conditions are very general information on what are the coldest and hottest months, based 
strictly on
the average monthly temperatures.

If you clarify what you're trying to determine, then I can tell you more on what you could do.

ASHRAE design conditions now includes monthly cooling design conditions.
The load calculations chapter in the Fundamentals recommends using the
monthly data...because each building can respond differently to climatic
conditions based on its configuration, thermal characteristics and systems.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Energy model calibration - normalizing the utility bills
 to month start-end
Message-ID: <25F861E695EA99478F9790869A57C7D4424A9DA1@catormsx02>

When calibrating an energy model to utility bills the utility bills often don?t align with the month start and end.  I have reviewed a couple methods to calendar normalize the utility bills but find them somewhat unsatisfactory.

For example the method I am looking at does the following:
The April gas bill runs from March 25 ? April 24.  The algorithm takes the average number of m3 per day from that bill, applies it to the days in April.  Then it takes the average number of days from the May bill which runs from April 24 ? May 25 and applies that average to the remaining days in April.

The issue is that the March-April period has much higher HDD than the April-May period and the ?normalized? gas usage is significantly lower than the simulation data for April.

I am wondering if there are any papers or other sources of information as to how others approach this problem.

Hello Chris,



ASHRAE Guideline 14-2014 has lots to say about this. So does the ASHRAE PMP, including lots and lots of references. In general, there are several things going on that can add noise to the answer.



First, for best results you should use measured weather data that has been recorded for the same period as the utility bills. Unfortunately, although this is easy to say in principle it can be difficult to apply. For example, not all weather sources have measured data for all channels, and worse, don't tell you when they have used an algorithm to "fill in" for missing data or to synthesize a channel that was never there. In addition, if your utility billing period runs over two different years, then you have to split the simulation since most simulations run from Jan to Dec, don't run contiguously for non-calendar periods (i.e., September to August). Weather data files also need to be consistent with the billing periods for non-contiguous periods. Use of average weather files to match actual utility bills is not recommended as this can introduce more error that you're trying to measure.



Second, since you have the simulation, I'd suggest you extract the hourly data from the simulation to match the calendar periods of the measured data. Then both can be "day normalized", or expressed as monthly average daily energy use (i.e., divide by the days in the month), and then weight the average by multiplying back by the number of days....since a month with 32 days should carry more weight than a month with 28 days when regressing...etc.



Third, don't use HDD or CDD to do anything. This is because commercial buildings don't normally behave according to 65 F change points. Instead, use the ASHRAE Inverse Model Toolkit, which comes free with Guideline 14, including the FORTRAN source code (...yes...FORTRAN). The IMT performs (1P, 2P, 3p,4P 5P) change-point linear and variable-based degree day calculations, depending on the what works best. This will do the weather normalization for you and give results that are consistent with Guideline 14. In fact, there's even a tutorial on how to use it in the appendix to Guideline 14 and you can get the RP 1050 final report to read more, including looking at the test data sets.



If you do use someone's software to do this, look for "algorithms by ASHRAE" in the software manual to make sure they are consistent with ASHRAE Guideline 14. That's why ASHRAE publishes the algorithms in source code to encourage software developers to use them providing they include the "powered by ASHRAE" in the manual.



Stay away from polynomials, quadratics, bi-quadratics, etc. as these are hard to reproduce from one person to the next even though the results look good.



Hope this helps.



Jeff

Maybe I'm missing something here, but why can't you just count up the degree days for the 
utility period?
I hope you're not working with average or "typical year" degree days, but the degree days 
from the same time period.

I also recall that the old Princeton Scorekeeping Method (PRISM) back in the 1980's allows 
the user to enter the degree days for that time period, so it's not a new problem.

Thanks Joe,

I did not mean to suggest using tmy data but did mean that actual weather
data for the billing period should be used.

One of my favorite sources of real time data is weather underground. They
have a lot of smaller weather stations and a great archive.

Cheers,

Mike

Hi Chris,

 

FASER and Metrix also calculated degree days in the actual billing periods.

 

I would be inclined to match the simulation to the billing periods.
Assuming you are using a DOE-2 based tool, I do not know how to change the
dates reported in the PS-E reports.  However you could create 12 periods in
the electrical and fuel rates based on the billing dates.  Then the ES-E and
ES-F would report the energy as well as cost split by billing period.

 

Cheers,

 

BF

Maybe I'm missing something here, but why can't you just count up the degree
days for the utility period?
I hope you're not working with average or "typical year" degree days, but
the degree days from the same time period.

I also recall that the old Princeton Scorekeeping Method (PRISM) back in the
1980's allows the user to enter the degree days for that time period, so
it's not a new problem.

For example the method I am looking at does the following:

The April gas bill runs from March 25 - April 24.  The algorithm takes the
average number of m3 per day from that bill, applies it to the days in
April.  Then it takes the average number of days from the May bill which
runs from April 24 - May 25 and applies that average to the remaining days
in April.  

 

The issue is that the March-April period has much higher HDD than the
April-May period and the "normalized" gas usage is significantly lower than
the simulation data for April.

 

I am wondering if there are any papers or other sources of information as to
how others approach this problem.

Hello Joe,



Yes, you can count the degree days and regress against that to show a correlation. However, one will get a better "fit" to the weather data if you regress to the degree day that is calculated for the balance point temperature of the building -- hence the inverse model toolkit or the variable based degree day method.



PRISM actually calculates the degree days to a variety of change points and actually provides a table for each location that you use as a look up. The IMT will actually perform a variable based degree day calculation that agrees well with PRISM. IMT will also provide you with the average daily temperature for the billing period.



When using DOE-2 for actual billing periods, one will have to extract the appropriate hourly variable, sum it to daily and then regroup to align with the billing periods. Here's a chunk of code that will create a dummy plant, display PV-A, PS-A, PS-E and BEPS, and extract the relevant hourly variables to normalize the BEPS to the utility bills:

Hello all,

 

We usually do the following to calibrate model to monthly utility bills:

1)      Create or purchase weather file corresponding to pre-retrofit period
for which we have billing data. Lately we've been using WeatherAnalytics
files, which we found to be more cost effective than creating our own (they
charge $40 for an annual file).

2)      Run simulation using this weather file instead of TMY.

3)      Standard simulation reports (we typically use eQUEST) show usage by
calendar month (e.g. January, February, etc.) which is usually not aligned
with dates of utility bills, as noted in the question that started this
thread. As Brian mentioned in one of the earlier posts, this may be
circumvented by entering the actual meter read dates into eQUEST as shown in
the screenshot below. This will align usages shown in eQUEST's "E*" reports
such as ES-E with the actual utility bills.  The approach does not allow
entering more than one read date per month (e.g. we can't capture April 3 -
28 bill). For projects where this limitation is an issue we generate hourly
reports that show consumption by end use for each meter in the project, and
aggregate it into periods that are aligned with utility bills. 



  

4)      We then copy simulation outputs (either from ES-E or hourly reports,
depending on the method used) into a standard spreadsheet with utility data.
The spreadsheet is set up to plot side by side monthly utility bills and
simulated usage, and also calculates normalized mean bias error (NMBE) and
variance CV(RMSE).   

5)      If we did not to where we want to be with NMBE and CV(RMSE) we
adjust and re-run the model, and re-paste results into the same spreadsheet.


 

In my experience regression analysis using weather as independent variable
(i.e. running model with TMY file and normalizing for difference in weather)
or relying on HDD to allocate usage to billing periods can be very
misleading, mainly because on many projects weather is not the main driver
of consumption. For example energy usage of a school during a given time
period depends much more on vacation schedule than outdoor dry bulb
temperatures.  

 

Thanks,

I hope you're not working with average or "typical year" degree days, but

I also recall that the old Princeton Scorekeeping Method (PRISM) back in the

it's not a new problem.

The issue is that the March-April period has much higher HDD than the
April-May period and the "normalized" gas usage is significantly lower than
the simulation data for April.

 

I am wondering if there are any papers or other sources of information as to
how others approach this problem.

 bills to month start-end
Message-ID: <c87f2349f51c484c83425de545fe74c8@pitt-prodx-04.univ.pitt.edu>

All,

This is a fantastic thread, and I am wondering if it could be taken one step further to query if anyone has experience with methods to attempt calibrating models of energy savings attributable to retrofits of multiple systems simultaneously (plant, envelope, HVAC etc. - as most real-world retrofits likely are), going past the 4- or 5-parameter breakpoint regression models to incorporate inverse modeling of specific load types and their space- or time-variable characteristics. This would fit under multivariate methods in the last line of Table 2 in the older version of ASHRAE Guideline 14 that Jeff Haberl has posted on his website, and would attempt to standardize Maria's Step 5 below without (possibly) the need to conduct as much in-depth field verification as might otherwise be required. I've dabbled in this a little bit...without extensive discussions with others...

Example: changing the OA ventilation rate is going to have a specific load profile versus some retrofit that affects the solar gain rate. Of course, much easier in theory to do calibrations of this sort with hourly meter data versus monthly utility bills...

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Energy model calibration - normalizing the utility bills to month start-end

Hello all,

We usually do the following to calibrate model to monthly utility bills:

1)      Create or purchase weather file corresponding to pre-retrofit period for which we have billing data. Lately we've been using WeatherAnalytics files, which we found to be more cost effective than creating our own (they charge $40 for an annual file).

2)      Run simulation using this weather file instead of TMY.

3)      Standard simulation reports (we typically use eQUEST) show usage by calendar month (e.g. January, February, etc.) which is usually not aligned with dates of utility bills, as noted in the question that started this thread. As Brian mentioned in one of the earlier posts, this may be circumvented by entering the actual meter read dates into eQUEST as shown in the screenshot below. This will align usages shown in eQUEST's "E*" reports such as ES-E with the actual utility bills.  The approach does not allow entering more than one read date per month (e.g. we can't capture April 3 - 28 bill). For projects where this limitation is an issue we generate hourly reports that show consumption by end use for each meter in the project, and aggregate it into periods that are aligned with utility bills.

[cid:image002.png at 01D0ADB7.5B5B12A0]



4)      We then copy simulation outputs (either from ES-E or hourly reports, depending on the method used) into a standard spreadsheet with utility data. The spreadsheet is set up to plot side by side monthly utility bills and simulated usage, and also calculates normalized mean bias error (NMBE) and variance CV(RMSE).

5)      If we did not to where we want to be with NMBE and CV(RMSE) we adjust and re-run the model, and re-paste results into the same spreadsheet.

In my experience regression analysis using weather as independent variable (i.e. running model with TMY file and normalizing for difference in weather) or relying on HDD to allocate usage to billing periods can be very misleading, mainly because on many projects weather is not the main driver of consumption. For example energy usage of a school during a given time period depends much more on vacation schedule than outdoor dry bulb temperatures.

Thanks,

Hello Joe,



Yes, you can count the degree days and regress against that to show a correlation. However, one will get a better "fit" to the weather data if you regress to the degree day that is calculated for the balance point temperature of the building -- hence the inverse model toolkit or the variable based degree day method.



PRISM actually calculates the degree days to a variety of change points and actually provides a table for each location that you use as a look up. The IMT will actually perform a variable based degree day calculation that agrees well with PRISM. IMT will also provide you with the average daily temperature for the billing period.



When using DOE-2 for actual billing periods, one will have to extract the appropriate hourly variable, sum it to daily and then regroup to align with the billing periods. Here's a chunk of code that will create a dummy plant, display PV-A, PS-A, PS-E and BEPS, and extract the relevant hourly variables to normalize the BEPS to the utility bills:



INPUT PLANT ..



PLANT-REPORT VERIFICATION = (PV-A)

Maybe I'm missing something here, but why can't you just count up the degree days for the utility period?
I hope you're not working with average or "typical year" degree days, but the degree days from the same time period.

I also recall that the old Princeton Scorekeeping Method (PRISM) back in the 1980's allows the user to enter the degree days for that time period, so it's not a new problem.

I'm encouraged to see so many people addressing this topic because it means
you are modeling existing buildings; a lot of work is needed in this
arena.  Keep it up!

We, as usual, have a spreadsheet solution.  In this case, the spreadsheet
is happy to use billing periods of any length, such as is normal for
day-of-reading variations, but also to combine "estimated" readings into a
period that has an actual reading at each end.
It requires that you tell EnergyPlus to report hourly meter data for each
fuel (e.g., electricity and natural gas).  A macro totals that data into
the billing periods for your site, displays the predicted vs actual energy
and calculates an R-squared value for each fuel and the total. An example
is shown below.

 calibration - normalizing the utility bills to month start-end

This is a little off-topic, but something I've pondered for some time...

The question is when people are using eQUEST/DOE-2 with historical year weather, what do 
you do when it's a leap year?  Since DOE-2
always simulates a 365-day year,  do you just ignore the missing leap day, but then don't 
the Days of Week also get screwed up starting in March?

Since a quarter of the years are leap years, I've never understood why accounting for them 
has been considered an insignificant detail.
I mean, if I told you that a quarter of the time your simulation results would be a little 
wrong, isn't that a pretty high frequency?

Many eQUEST/DOE-2 users also have the mistaken impression that the fault lies in the DOE-2 
weather files, which is not true.
Believe it or not, but the packed DOE-2 weather file format actually contains 384 days (32 
days per month), and all the DOE-2 weather files I produce always contains Feb. 29 for the 
leap years (as well as other enhancements like greater precision in the data).

So, where does the problem lie?  It's in the clock within DOE-2 that always sets February 
to be 28 days.  In other words, DOE-2 will read the weather file and do the simulation 
only through February 28th, even though the weather file contains data through February 
32nd (:-)), although everything beyond the 28th would be blank on non-leap years, and 
beyond the 29th on leap years.

When I've looked through the DOE-2.1E code, there are even flags setting the leap years 
but these are never used. I've thought many times of toying around with the code to see 
how difficult it would be to implement leap years, but just haven't gotten around to it. 
As far as I can see, the biggest difficulty might might have to do not with the simulation 
itself, but with the reporting.

I'd like to know if others think this is something of sufficient importance to merit 
further investigation.

   1. Use EnergyPlus :), which allows >365 days.  This is also helpful when
   the combined two-fuel billing cycle is 13-14 months.
   2. Ignore the 1/365 difference.  Do you really think it will matter much?

Jim and all,

 

We have incentive programs in NY (Multifamily Performance Program) and NJ (Pay for Performance Program for C&I buildings, P4P) that require developing calibrated models to estimate ECM savings. Both programs rely on spreadsheet-based tools to facilitate model calibration, and require that the proposed ECM package reduces overall energy consumption by at least 15%. The programs have been around for 5+ years, and have hundreds of participating projects. Part of the incentive is awarded based on the projected (i.e. modeled) savings, and the rest (as much as 50% for P4P) based on the actual achieved savings established using Whole Building approach by comparing pre/post utility bills. 

 

My biggest take away from the involvement with these programs was that a calibrated model that meets MBE,  CVRMSE, and uncertainty requirements of Guideline 14 may produce grossly incorrect ECM savings. It is not feasible to create a calibrated model that can be reliably used to project savings from any conceivable ECM in a commercial non-research setting because, aside from the modeling effort, it would require a lot of very detailed field work. On the other hand, developing a calibrated simulation to estimate savings from a particular set of measures considered for a given project is a much more manageable task. So the bulk of the recent updates to the technical requirements of our incentive programs were focused on itemizing parameters that should be tweaked to achieve calibration depending on the ECMs included in the project scope. For example, if project involves boiler replacement, efficiency of existing boilers that are being replaced must be measured. (We had a project which modeled existing boiler as 35% efficient because that produced calibrated simulation. Of course such model would very likely exaggerate savings from installing a new boiler.) 

 

Do any of you know references that outline calibration techniques depending on the ECMs being modeled, beyond the general advice included in IPM&VP?

 

Thanks,

 

Maria

I'm encouraged to see so many people addressing this topic because it means you are modeling existing buildings; a lot of work is needed in this arena.  Keep it up!

 

We, as usual, have a spreadsheet solution.  In this case, the spreadsheet is happy to use billing periods of any length, such as is normal for day-of-reading variations, but also to combine "estimated" readings into a period that has an actual reading at each end.

It requires that you tell EnergyPlus to report hourly meter data for each fuel (e.g., electricity and natural gas).  A macro totals that data into the billing periods for your site, displays the predicted vs actual energy and calculates an R-squared value for each fuel and the total. An example is shown below.

Hello all,

 

We usually do the following to calibrate model to monthly utility bills:

1)      Create or purchase weather file corresponding to pre-retrofit period for which we have billing data. Lately we?ve been using WeatherAnalytics files, which we found to be more cost effective than creating our own (they charge $40 for an annual file).

2)      Run simulation using this weather file instead of TMY.

3)      Standard simulation reports (we typically use eQUEST) show usage by calendar month (e.g. January, February, etc.) which is usually not aligned with dates of utility bills, as noted in the question that started this thread. As Brian mentioned in one of the earlier posts, this may be circumvented by entering the actual meter read dates into eQUEST as shown in the screenshot below. This will align usages shown in eQUEST?s ?E*? reports such as ES-E with the actual utility bills.  The approach does not allow entering more than one read date per month (e.g. we can?t capture April 3 ? 28 bill). For projects where this limitation is an issue we generate hourly reports that show consumption by end use for each meter in the project, and aggregate it into periods that are aligned with utility bills. 



  

4)      We then copy simulation outputs (either from ES-E or hourly reports, depending on the method used) into a standard spreadsheet with utility data. The spreadsheet is set up to plot side by side monthly utility bills and simulated usage, and also calculates normalized mean bias error (NMBE) and variance CV(RMSE).   

5)      If we did not to where we want to be with NMBE and CV(RMSE) we adjust and re-run the model, and re-paste results into the same spreadsheet. 

 

In my experience regression analysis using weather as independent variable (i.e. running model with TMY file and normalizing for difference in weather) or relying on HDD to allocate usage to billing periods can be very misleading, mainly because on many projects weather is not the main driver of consumption. For example energy usage of a school during a given time period depends much more on vacation schedule than outdoor dry bulb temperatures.  

 

Thanks,

Hello Joe,

 

Yes, you can count the degree days and regress against that to show a correlation. However, one will get a better "fit" to the weather data if you regress to the degree day that is calculated for the balance point temperature of the building -- hence the inverse model toolkit or the variable based degree day method.

 

PRISM actually calculates the degree days to a variety of change points and actually provides a table for each location that you use as a look up. The IMT will actually perform a variable based degree day calculation that agrees well with PRISM. IMT will also provide you with the average daily temperature for the billing period.

 

When using DOE-2 for actual billing periods, one will have to extract the appropriate hourly variable, sum it to daily and then regroup to align with the billing periods. Here's a chunk of code that will create a dummy plant, display PV-A, PS-A, PS-E and BEPS, and extract the relevant hourly variables to normalize the BEPS to the utility bills:

Maybe I'm missing something here, but why can't you just count up the degree days for the utility period?
I hope you're not working with average or "typical year" degree days, but the degree days from the same time period.

I also recall that the old Princeton Scorekeeping Method (PRISM) back in the 1980's allows the user to enter the degree days for that time period, so it's not a new problem.

When calibrating an energy model to utility bills the utility bills often don?t align with the month start and end.  I have reviewed a couple methods to calendar normalize the utility bills but find them somewhat unsatisfactory.

 

For example the method I am looking at does the following:

The April gas bill runs from March 25 ? April 24.  The algorithm takes the average number of m3 per day from that bill, applies it to the days in April.  Then it takes the average number of days from the May bill which runs from April 24 ? May 25 and applies that average to the remaining days in April.  

 

The issue is that the March-April period has much higher HDD than the April-May period and the ?normalized? gas usage is significantly lower than the simulation data for April.

 

I am wondering if there are any papers or other sources of information as to how others approach this problem.

I think the cleanest is you just pretend every day is off by one. Ignore
all of the month garbage (yes you'll be off by a day at times). Just think
about it as days 1-365, with the right day of the week assigned. You can
reassign your holidays if you want. You wind up dropping the real 12/31.

But I like the "just use EnergyPlus" option.

The responses so far are not what I expected and, in my view, miss the point.
I was not talking about workarounds or ignoring the missing day in DOE-2, which is what I 
presume everyone has been doing up until now.  I'm frankly tired of that, because adding 
the fixes to DOE-2 seems to be quite easy to do.

I also find the responses of "just use EnergyPlus" to be disingenuous and condescending.  
It's like trying to fix a scratch on your car, and then somebody comes by and says, "oh, 
just go and buy this new better one".

I'll second that this has turned into a really good thread. My personal
rule of thumb in doing calibration is, "don't mess with things that relate
directly to an ECM." If you have a retrofit ECM going on, you should have
detailed data on the pre-installation conditions associated with that ECM.
If that isn't documented, your model is never going to provide you with
accurate savings results. It pays to think about these things at the
fundamental level. And also apply a reasonableness range to those values.
What am I most unsure about? What's the possible range of this value?
Personally, I twist my dials all in one direction and then use setpoint as
my fine calibration factor at the end. We need to remember that we're using
models as tools to help guide decision-making. When we make decisions in
calibration, we should think about how it will impact the decision being
made -- does it impose a bias (like the 35% assumed pre-retrofit boiler
efficiency for a boiler retrofit project)? These models are just tools for
extrapolating from known energy consumption data to unknown energy
consumption data.

An earlier post commented that hourly data might make calibration easier...
It doesn't make it easier in the sense of less work, but it does make your
model a lot better if you do it right. Calibrating models to real hourly
consumption data tells you so much about what is likely wrong with your
model and so much about how your real building performs. If you have hourly
end use data, or close, then you are really in business. At the aggregate
level, this kind of data can tell you that you didn't really know much to
start with. For one project for Con Edison, we had access to hourly
whole-premise consumption data for several thousand NYC buildings by
building type. We were able to use this data to uncover that our models
vastly underestimated consumption at nights and on weekends. We didn't know
why, but we altered schedules accordingly.

As for the monthly billing data question at the beginnning of this thread,
if you're dealing with a building and climate where monthly variability in
occupancy and weather are driving changes in energy consumption in smooth,
continuous fashion, you can make some other approximations. We've used a
simplified slope method, where you calculate the slope in usage between the
two adjacent billing months, i.e. if period 1 is 1000 kWh/day, period 2 is
1100 kWh/day, and period 3 is 1200 kWh/day, and all are 30 days long, you
wind up with a slope of 3.33 kWh/day. We then assign daily kWh for each
month using this slope and then reslice the data to match our calendar
months. This is important when you are calibrating an aggregate model,
which is a common need for us when we're estimating program-level savings
for an ECM. For example, we're using a building simulation model to
extrapolate measured consumption at a large sample of sites to usage in a
typical year.

Alternatively, for individual buildings, we don't worry about it and just
calibrate to the billing periods instead. We're not generally working in
eQuest, but rather with the hourly output of whatever engine we're using.

One thing I've been wondering about recently is how to avoid
over-calibration. The econometrics/statty/mathy folks I occasionally
consort with talk a lot about overfitting of regressions and the same
problem applies here. Has anybody ever tried reserving part of their
calibration data set to use as a test set? I've gotten some things that
looked like really great calibrations in the past, but I'm wondering how
folks have sought to prove whether they were getting things right or
overfitting. When I teach junior staff about this sort of thing, I always
include something about not getting too cute. I point them to the John Von
Neumann quote:

   - *With four parameters I can fit an elephant
   <https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Elephant>, and with five I can make him
   wiggle his trunk.*

I guess the better, more direct answer, from my perspective is:
No, I don't think this is that important compared to some of the other

I hear your frustrations Joe, but after finding many, many issues with
eQuest/Doe-2 that never got fixed, I eventually did "just" switch to
EnergyPlus.  I'm not sure when the last time DOE2 got a major update, but
EnergyPlus is getting major updates all the time.  There are people
actively supporting this software and every bug and idiosyncrasy I've found
has either been fixed, or is in the cue to be fixed.

In my opinion, this community needs to either:

1.  Support a major update to eQuest/DOE-2 that fixes this, and many other
issues.  If you are capable and interested in fixing some of these bugs -
maybe try a crowdfunding campaign?  People could contribute towards fixing
particular issues or bugs.
2.  Recognize the limitations of eQuest/ DOE-2 and use it only when
projects can be appropriately modeled with this software.
3.  Switch software packages completely.

One of the challenges in this industry is that people are used to getting
software for free.  eQuest, DOE-2, EnergyPlus have all be developed in
large part with public funding.  When that funding goes away, support
stops, but people still have the expectation that the software should be
free.

Getting upset that eQuest / DOE-2 doesn?t incorporate leap year data is like getting upset that it can?t predict a snow day.  Or a power outage.  If you are using an energy model for a specific task where missing 1 day in 1,460 is going to affect someone?s decision making process, and/or you?re not willing to multiply February energy consumption by 29/28 for that year, then that is worrisome.  No energy modeling program is so accurate that this would make a difference.  But that?s just my opinion.  I have lots of scratches on my car and don?t care?

I hear your frustrations Joe, but after finding many, many issues with eQuest/Doe-2 that never got fixed, I eventually did "just" switch to EnergyPlus.  I'm not sure when the last time DOE2 got a major update, but EnergyPlus is getting major updates all the time.  There are people actively supporting this software and every bug and idiosyncrasy I've found has either been fixed, or is in the cue to be fixed.

In my opinion, this community needs to either:

1.  Support a major update to eQuest/DOE-2 that fixes this, and many other issues.  If you are capable and interested in fixing some of these bugs - maybe try a crowdfunding campaign?  People could contribute towards fixing particular issues or bugs.
2.  Recognize the limitations of eQuest/ DOE-2 and use it only when projects can be appropriately modeled with this software.
3.  Switch software packages completely.

One of the challenges in this industry is that people are used to getting software for free.  eQuest, DOE-2, EnergyPlus have all be developed in large part with public funding.  When that funding goes away, support stops, but people still have the expectation that the software should be free.

I was not talking about workarounds or ignoring the missing day in DOE-2, which is what I presume everyone has been doing up until now.  I'm frankly tired of that, because adding the fixes to DOE-2 seems to be quite easy to do.

I also find the responses of "just use EnergyPlus" to be disingenuous and condescending.  It's like trying to fix a scratch on your car, and then somebody comes by and says, "oh, just go and buy this new better one".

This is a little off-topic, but something I've pondered for some time...

The question is when people are using eQUEST/DOE-2 with historical year weather, what do you do when it's a leap year?  Since DOE-2
always simulates a 365-day year,  do you just ignore the missing leap day, but then don't the Days of Week also get screwed up starting in March?

Since a quarter of the years are leap years, I've never understood why accounting for them has been considered an insignificant detail.
I mean, if I told you that a quarter of the time your simulation results would be a little wrong, isn't that a pretty high frequency?

Many eQUEST/DOE-2 users also have the mistaken impression that the fault lies in the DOE-2 weather files, which is not true.
Believe it or not, but the packed DOE-2 weather file format actually contains 384 days (32 days per month), and all the DOE-2 weather files I produce always contains Feb. 29 for the leap years (as well as other enhancements like greater precision in the data).

So, where does the problem lie?  It's in the clock within DOE-2 that always sets February to be 28 days.  In other words, DOE-2 will read the weather file and do the simulation only through February 28th, even though the weather file contains data through February 32nd (:-)), although everything beyond the 28th would be blank on non-leap years, and beyond the 29th on leap years.

When I've looked through the DOE-2.1E code, there are even flags setting the leap years but these are never used. I've thought many times of toying around with the code to see how difficult it would be to implement leap years, but just haven't gotten around to it.  As far as I can see, the biggest difficulty might might have to do not with the simulation itself, but with the reporting.

I'd like to know if others think this is something of sufficient importance to merit further investigation.

All,

This is a fantastic thread, and I am wondering if it could be taken one step further to query if anyone has experience with methods to attempt calibrating models of energy savings attributable to retrofits of multiple systems simultaneously (plant, envelope, HVAC etc. ? as most real-world retrofits likely are), going past the 4- or 5-parameter breakpoint regression models to incorporate inverse modeling of specific load types and their space- or time-variable characteristics. This would fit under multivariate methods in the last line of Table 2 in the older version of ASHRAE Guideline 14 that Jeff Haberl has posted on his website, and would attempt to standardize Maria?s Step 5 below without (possibly) the need to conduct as much in-depth field verification as might otherwise be required. I?ve dabbled in this a little bit?without extensive discussions with others?

Example: changing the OA ventilation rate is going to have a specific load profile versus some retrofit that affects the solar gain rate. Of course, much easier in theory to do calibrations of this sort with hourly meter data versus monthly utility bills?

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Energy model calibration - normalizing the utility bills to month start-end

Hello all,

We usually do the following to calibrate model to monthly utility bills:

1)      Create or purchase weather file corresponding to pre-retrofit period for which we have billing data. Lately we?ve been using WeatherAnalytics files, which we found to be more cost effective than creating our own (they charge $40 for an annual file).

2)      Run simulation using this weather file instead of TMY.

3)      Standard simulation reports (we typically use eQUEST) show usage by calendar month (e.g. January, February, etc.) which is usually not aligned with dates of utility bills, as noted in the question that started this thread. As Brian mentioned in one of the earlier posts, this may be circumvented by entering the actual meter read dates into eQUEST as shown in the screenshot below. This will align usages shown in eQUEST?s ?E*? reports such as ES-E with the actual utility bills.  The approach does not allow entering more than one read date per month (e.g. we can?t capture April 3 ? 28 bill). For projects where this limitation is an issue we generate hourly reports that show consumption by end use for each meter in the project, and aggregate it into periods that are aligned with utility bills.

[cid:image001.png at 01D0ADD6.D9D5F9F0]



4)      We then copy simulation outputs (either from ES-E or hourly reports, depending on the method used) into a standard spreadsheet with utility data. The spreadsheet is set up to plot side by side monthly utility bills and simulated usage, and also calculates normalized mean bias error (NMBE) and variance CV(RMSE).

5)      If we did not to where we want to be with NMBE and CV(RMSE) we adjust and re-run the model, and re-paste results into the same spreadsheet.

In my experience regression analysis using weather as independent variable (i.e. running model with TMY file and normalizing for difference in weather) or relying on HDD to allocate usage to billing periods can be very misleading, mainly because on many projects weather is not the main driver of consumption. For example energy usage of a school during a given time period depends much more on vacation schedule than outdoor dry bulb temperatures.

Thanks,

Hello Joe,



Yes, you can count the degree days and regress against that to show a correlation. However, one will get a better "fit" to the weather data if you regress to the degree day that is calculated for the balance point temperature of the building -- hence the inverse model toolkit or the variable based degree day method.



PRISM actually calculates the degree days to a variety of change points and actually provides a table for each location that you use as a look up. The IMT will actually perform a variable based degree day calculation that agrees well with PRISM. IMT will also provide you with the average daily temperature for the billing period.



When using DOE-2 for actual billing periods, one will have to extract the appropriate hourly variable, sum it to daily and then regroup to align with the billing periods. Here's a chunk of code that will create a dummy plant, display PV-A, PS-A, PS-E and BEPS, and extract the relevant hourly variables to normalize the BEPS to the utility bills:

Maybe I'm missing something here, but why can't you just count up the degree days for the utility period?
I hope you're not working with average or "typical year" degree days, but the degree days from the same time period.

I also recall that the old Princeton Scorekeeping Method (PRISM) back in the 1980's allows the user to enter the degree days for that time period, so it's not a new problem.

When calibrating an energy model to utility bills the utility bills often don?t align with the month start and end.  I have reviewed a couple methods to calendar normalize the utility bills but find them somewhat unsatisfactory.

For example the method I am looking at does the following:
The April gas bill runs from March 25 ? April 24.  The algorithm takes the average number of m3 per day from that bill, applies it to the days in April.  Then it takes the average number of days from the May bill which runs from April 24 ? May 25 and applies that average to the remaining days in April.

The issue is that the March-April period has much higher HDD than the April-May period and the ?normalized? gas usage is significantly lower than the simulation data for April.

I am wondering if there are any papers or other sources of information as to how others approach this problem.

This has been an interesting thread. I raised this question at an ASHRAE conference a few years ago and nobody in that session did anything to account for Leap Day.

Couldn?t the day of the week selected for January 1 be shifted a day so that the last 10 months of the year will match and only 2 months will be off (instead of 2 months matching and 10 months being off a day)?

Dear Joe,
Absolutely no condescension intended.  I apologize for even coming close.  It was supposed to be tongue in cheek; I realize that switching software is a tough thing and not necessarily a good plan for all.

Getting upset that eQuest / DOE-2 doesn?t incorporate leap year data is like getting upset that it can?t predict a snow day.  Or a power outage.  If you are using an energy model for a specific task where missing 1 day in 1,460 is going to affect someone?s decision making process, and/or you?re not willing to multiply February energy consumption by 29/28 for that year, then that is worrisome.  No energy modeling program is so accurate that this would make a difference.  But that?s just my opinion.  I have lots of scratches on my car and don?t care?

I hear your frustrations Joe, but after finding many, many issues with eQuest/Doe-2 that never got fixed, I eventually did "just" switch to EnergyPlus.  I'm not sure when the last time DOE2 got a major update, but EnergyPlus is getting major updates all the time.  There are people actively supporting this software and every bug and idiosyncrasy I've found has either been fixed, or is in the cue to be fixed.

In my opinion, this community needs to either:

1.  Support a major update to eQuest/DOE-2 that fixes this, and many other issues.  If you are capable and interested in fixing some of these bugs - maybe try a crowdfunding campaign?  People could contribute towards fixing particular issues or bugs.
2.  Recognize the limitations of eQuest/ DOE-2 and use it only when projects can be appropriately modeled with this software.
3.  Switch software packages completely.

One of the challenges in this industry is that people are used to getting software for free.  eQuest, DOE-2, EnergyPlus have all be developed in large part with public funding.  When that funding goes away, support stops, but people still have the expectation that the software should be free.

The responses so far are not what I expected and, in my view, miss the point.
I was not talking about workarounds or ignoring the missing day in DOE-2, which is what I presume everyone has been doing up until now.  I'm frankly tired of that, because adding the fixes to DOE-2 seems to be quite easy to do.

I also find the responses of "just use EnergyPlus" to be disingenuous and condescending.  It's like trying to fix a scratch on your car, and then somebody comes by and says, "oh, just go and buy this new better one".

I think the cleanest is you just pretend every day is off by one. Ignore all of the month garbage (yes you'll be off by a day at times). Just think about it as days 1-365, with the right day of the week assigned. You can reassign your holidays if you want. You wind up dropping the real 12/31.

But I like the "just use EnergyPlus" option.

This is a little off-topic, but something I've pondered for some time...

The question is when people are using eQUEST/DOE-2 with historical year weather, what do you do when it's a leap year?  Since DOE-2
always simulates a 365-day year,  do you just ignore the missing leap day, but then don't the Days of Week also get screwed up starting in March?

Since a quarter of the years are leap years, I've never understood why accounting for them has been considered an insignificant detail.
I mean, if I told you that a quarter of the time your simulation results would be a little wrong, isn't that a pretty high frequency?

Many eQUEST/DOE-2 users also have the mistaken impression that the fault lies in the DOE-2 weather files, which is not true.
Believe it or not, but the packed DOE-2 weather file format actually contains 384 days (32 days per month), and all the DOE-2 weather files I produce always contains Feb. 29 for the leap years (as well as other enhancements like greater precision in the data).

So, where does the problem lie?  It's in the clock within DOE-2 that always sets February to be 28 days.  In other words, DOE-2 will read the weather file and do the simulation only through February 28th, even though the weather file contains data through February 32nd (:-)), although everything beyond the 28th would be blank on non-leap years, and beyond the 29th on leap years.

When I've looked through the DOE-2.1E code, there are even flags setting the leap years but these are never used. I've thought many times of toying around with the code to see how difficult it would be to implement leap years, but just haven't gotten around to it.  As far as I can see, the biggest difficulty might might have to do not with the simulation itself, but with the reporting.

I'd like to know if others think this is something of sufficient importance to merit further investigation.

All,

This is a fantastic thread, and I am wondering if it could be taken one step further to query if anyone has experience with methods to attempt calibrating models of energy savings attributable to retrofits of multiple systems simultaneously (plant, envelope, HVAC etc. ? as most real-world retrofits likely are), going past the 4- or 5-parameter breakpoint regression models to incorporate inverse modeling of specific load types and their space- or time-variable characteristics. This would fit under multivariate methods in the last line of Table 2 in the older version of ASHRAE Guideline 14 that Jeff Haberl has posted on his website, and would attempt to standardize Maria?s Step 5 below without (possibly) the need to conduct as much in-depth field verification as might otherwise be required. I?ve dabbled in this a little bit?without extensive discussions with others?

Example: changing the OA ventilation rate is going to have a specific load profile versus some retrofit that affects the solar gain rate. Of course, much easier in theory to do calibrations of this sort with hourly meter data versus monthly utility bills?

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Energy model calibration - normalizing the utility bills to month start-end

Hello all,

We usually do the following to calibrate model to monthly utility bills:

1)      Create or purchase weather file corresponding to pre-retrofit period for which we have billing data. Lately we?ve been using WeatherAnalytics files, which we found to be more cost effective than creating our own (they charge $40 for an annual file).

2)      Run simulation using this weather file instead of TMY.

3)      Standard simulation reports (we typically use eQUEST) show usage by calendar month (e.g. January, February, etc.) which is usually not aligned with dates of utility bills, as noted in the question that started this thread. As Brian mentioned in one of the earlier posts, this may be circumvented by entering the actual meter read dates into eQUEST as shown in the screenshot below. This will align usages shown in eQUEST?s ?E*? reports such as ES-E with the actual utility bills.  The approach does not allow entering more than one read date per month (e.g. we can?t capture April 3 ? 28 bill). For projects where this limitation is an issue we generate hourly reports that show consumption by end use for each meter in the project, and aggregate it into periods that are aligned with utility bills.

[cid:image001.png at 01D0ADD6.D9D5F9F0]



4)      We then copy simulation outputs (either from ES-E or hourly reports, depending on the method used) into a standard spreadsheet with utility data. The spreadsheet is set up to plot side by side monthly utility bills and simulated usage, and also calculates normalized mean bias error (NMBE) and variance CV(RMSE).

5)      If we did not to where we want to be with NMBE and CV(RMSE) we adjust and re-run the model, and re-paste results into the same spreadsheet.

In my experience regression analysis using weather as independent variable (i.e. running model with TMY file and normalizing for difference in weather) or relying on HDD to allocate usage to billing periods can be very misleading, mainly because on many projects weather is not the main driver of consumption. For example energy usage of a school during a given time period depends much more on vacation schedule than outdoor dry bulb temperatures.

Thanks,

Hello Joe,



Yes, you can count the degree days and regress against that to show a correlation. However, one will get a better "fit" to the weather data if you regress to the degree day that is calculated for the balance point temperature of the building -- hence the inverse model toolkit or the variable based degree day method.



PRISM actually calculates the degree days to a variety of change points and actually provides a table for each location that you use as a look up. The IMT will actually perform a variable based degree day calculation that agrees well with PRISM. IMT will also provide you with the average daily temperature for the billing period.



When using DOE-2 for actual billing periods, one will have to extract the appropriate hourly variable, sum it to daily and then regroup to align with the billing periods. Here's a chunk of code that will create a dummy plant, display PV-A, PS-A, PS-E and BEPS, and extract the relevant hourly variables to normalize the BEPS to the utility bills:

Maybe I'm missing something here, but why can't you just count up the degree days for the utility period?
I hope you're not working with average or "typical year" degree days, but the degree days from the same time period.

I also recall that the old Princeton Scorekeeping Method (PRISM) back in the 1980's allows the user to enter the degree days for that time period, so it's not a new problem.

When calibrating an energy model to utility bills the utility bills often don?t align with the month start and end.  I have reviewed a couple methods to calendar normalize the utility bills but find them somewhat unsatisfactory.

For example the method I am looking at does the following:
The April gas bill runs from March 25 ? April 24.  The algorithm takes the average number of m3 per day from that bill, applies it to the days in April.  Then it takes the average number of days from the May bill which runs from April 24 ? May 25 and applies that average to the remaining days in April.

The issue is that the March-April period has much higher HDD than the April-May period and the ?normalized? gas usage is significantly lower than the simulation data for April.

I am wondering if there are any papers or other sources of information as to how others approach this problem.

It's days of the week that matter. You'll never get your calibration to
line up on daily or hourly usage if your days of the week get off. I was
trying to say in my earlier response that your days of the week are not off
by a day if you just let it ride and have your simulation still run through
days 1-365. What's off by a day is your month start and end days and
potentially your holidays, which you can relatively easily set to alternate
dates.

Justin,

That's right. The biggest impact of the missing leap day is not the missing day itself, 
but the shift in the days of the week after Feb. 29th.  Yesterday I made a run for a leap 
year (1992) to confirm that DOE-2 doesn't adjust the days of the week for the missing day, 
i.e., Mar. 1 is not two days-of-the-week behind Feb. 28.

Now, if you're modeling a building that has distinct workday and weekend schedules, as all 
commercial buildings do, the  daily load shapes will be out of phase with what they 
actually are from March 1 through the end of the year.  To me, that alone would be 
sufficient reason to fix, especially that the fix is not very difficult.

The main reason this defect has been neglected so far is that most simulations are still 
being done for design assessment using "typical year" weather data.  However, now that 
more simulations are being done using actual year weather data to compare to  actual 
performance, the defect is no longer so trivial.

Excellent insights in this thread!
Our "two cents":

   - We measure key variables such as larger motor kW and outdoor airflow.
   The idea is to eliminate uncertainty for energy aspects that we know are
   "big".  Because it's easy to obtain, we use the actual weather data.  It's
   not always a big impact, but eliminates needless uncertainty.
   - We don't trust people's memory about almost anything; it's amazing how
   different the story can be when told by two different people, both of whom
   should be knowledgeable.
   - We also don't trust sensor calibration.  Not all sensors matter as
   much, however; discharge sensors on reheat systems, for example, matter
   more than room temp sensors.
   - More data is better.  Smart meters are very helpful, as is trend data
   if the client has taken time to set them up. Not many do :(
   - We have not yet tinkered with sensitivity analysis for uncertain
   variables such as boiler efficiency or infiltration, but we do run GenOpt
   for the best R-squared fit to each (exact) billing period and review /
   revise the output for reasonableness.
   - On the one hand, it bothers me that calibrated models are "grossly
   incorrect" in Maria's experience.  My bias is that those models may have
   too little measured data.  On the other hand, this is a brave new world and
   we probably all have a lot to learn.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Window Condensation - Fluent
Message-ID: <995150E05303A24FA74A0CDD91CECCC336723740@FACADE1.facade.local>

I'm trying to model the potential for condensation in a window assembly. The window assembly has an existing single-pane steel frame window and we're adding a single (or double) glazed unit on the interior. The exterior frame has some air leakage that I would need to make some assumptions about in the modeling.
I've started to model this in ANSYS Fluent, but I'm having trouble getting all of the parameters set correctly. I was wondering if anyone can recommend any papers and/or tutorials on this topic. I know it's a very complicated thing to model and there are (like any model) a lot of 'known unknowns' that will impact the results. I'm hoping to find some research that has already been done in this area and build or modify my project from that. Has anyone done this successfully?

A dissertation, no less.  FYI, I think I 'll be able to absorb this
sometime next week, but not sooner.
Thank you for sending it; I don't think I attended your talk because all of
this is sounding new... and I like learning.

Hi Jillian,

This paper from ANSYS might be useful to your project (note that it is
however a bit dated)-- it describes the modeling of fogging on automobile
windshields:

http://www.ansys.com/Resource%20Library/Conference%20Papers/Analytical+Simulation+of+Automobile+Windshield+Defogging

The current version of Fluent has an evaporation-condensation model which
might be applicable to what you are trying to do. I am sure you can find
tutorials from ANSYS on the use of this model.

Regards,
Ajith

Jim,

 

FYI attached is a presentation from 2014 ASRHAE/IBPSA summarizing our findings on accuracy of the calibrated simulations based on projects that went through an incentive program in NJ. (You presented there also ? loved your Sherlock Holmes hat and pipe J.) To clarify the language, ECM savings estimated via calibrated simulation are referred in the presentation as ?projected savings?; ECM savings estimated via ?whole building? approach are referred to as ?realized savings?.  Slide 7 summarizes high level results ? while there was a relatively good alignment between the total projected and realized savings for the entire sample, individual projects were all over the map. 

 

I agree with your last point below that the greatest source of error is too little measured data, but given the finite budget that each project has, I hoped that documents such as Guideline 14 would emphasize the link between the minimum scope of measurements and ECMs considered for a given project. For example Guidelines 14 says the following concerning simulation defaults, which in my opinion is impractical:  

 

5.3.3.3.7 Minimizing Default Values. Check and thoroughly 

understand all default input variables in the simulation

program, as many of the default values have little resemblance

to the actual building being simulated. The fewer the

number of default values used, the more representative the

simulation will be?but only if the changes are well reasoned.

This also includes inspection of the default performance

curves of the various systems and plant equipment, because

such curves can significantly impact the results of the simulation.

Any program default values that are altered, however,

should be well documented.

 

There is also a section on adjusting infiltration / ventilation rates to calibrate the model (quoted below), but it should only apply if project does not include ECMs involving air-sealing (which are common in multifamily and school projects) or ventilation controls such as DCV. If project includes infiltration or ventilation related measures, the related inputs cannot be used to calibrate the model even as ?a last resort?.

 

5.3.3.3.6 Estimating Infiltration Rates. Infiltration

rates are difficult to measure and may be treated as an

unknown that is iteratively solved with the simulation program

once the other major parameters are determined. This 

approach is only recommended as a last resort. To solve for

the infiltration rate and/or the ventilation rate iteratively, conduct

a series of simulation runs such that only the infiltration

and/or ventilation rates are changed from one-tenth to as

much as ten times the expected rates. Next, compare the simulation

outputs produced to the measured building data as discussed

below. In addition, supporting evidence should be

used to justify the final choice of variables.

 

I think calibrated simulation should be treated as an extension of retrofit isolation approach, and site measurements performed in support of simulation must at minimum include (a) parameters that are modified to model ECM savings, and (b) simulation inputs that do not change but drive ECM savings. For lighting fixture replacement ECM, pre-retrofit wattage would be an example of (a), and lighting runtime hours would be an example of (b). On the other hand, if there are no ECMs that reduce base load (e.g. plug load, lighting, etc.), but there are ECMs involving HVAC controls, site measurements should focus on operation of existing controls, and establishing existing lighting wattage is not necessary because model calibrated to capture the overall base load (lighting + plug loads) usage may be good enough in this case. We had to develop guidelines for incentive programs that rely on calibrated simulation to specify minimum scope of measurements and acceptable ?estimated? inputs for each common ECM type. I hope that a similar guidance would be included at some point in one of ASHRAE standards / guidelines. As it stands now, there is a sea of difference between the specificity of simulation requirements in 90.1 Appendix G compared to calibrated simulation of existing buildings. Unless I am missing some key reference?    

 

Maria

Excellent insights in this thread!

Our "two cents":

*	We measure key variables such as larger motor kW and outdoor airflow.  The idea is to eliminate uncertainty for energy aspects that we know are "big".  Because it's easy to obtain, we use the actual weather data.  It's not always a big impact, but eliminates needless uncertainty.
*	We don't trust people's memory about almost anything; it's amazing how different the story can be when told by two different people, both of whom should be knowledgeable.
*	We also don't trust sensor calibration.  Not all sensors matter as much, however; discharge sensors on reheat systems, for example, matter more than room temp sensors.
*	More data is better.  Smart meters are very helpful, as is trend data if the client has taken time to set them up. Not many do :(
*	We have not yet tinkered with sensitivity analysis for uncertain variables such as boiler efficiency or infiltration, but we do run GenOpt for the best R-squared fit to each (exact) billing period and review / revise the output for reasonableness.
*	On the one hand, it bothers me that calibrated models are "grossly incorrect" in Maria's experience.  My bias is that those models may have too little measured data.  On the other hand, this is a brave new world and we probably all have a lot to learn.

I'll second that this has turned into a really good thread. My personal rule of thumb in doing calibration is, "don't mess with things that relate directly to an ECM." If you have a retrofit ECM going on, you should have detailed data on the pre-installation conditions associated with that ECM. If that isn't documented, your model is never going to provide you with accurate savings results. It pays to think about these things at the fundamental level. And also apply a reasonableness range to those values. What am I most unsure about? What's the possible range of this value? Personally, I twist my dials all in one direction and then use setpoint as my fine calibration factor at the end. We need to remember that we're using models as tools to help guide decision-making. When we make decisions in calibration, we should think about how it will impact the decision being made -- does it impose a bias (like the 35% assumed pre-retrofit boiler efficiency for a boiler retrofit project)? These models are just tools for extrapolating from known energy consumption data to unknown energy consumption data. 

 

An earlier post commented that hourly data might make calibration easier... It doesn't make it easier in the sense of less work, but it does make your model a lot better if you do it right. Calibrating models to real hourly consumption data tells you so much about what is likely wrong with your model and so much about how your real building performs. If you have hourly end use data, or close, then you are really in business. At the aggregate level, this kind of data can tell you that you didn't really know much to start with. For one project for Con Edison, we had access to hourly whole-premise consumption data for several thousand NYC buildings by building type. We were able to use this data to uncover that our models vastly underestimated consumption at nights and on weekends. We didn't know why, but we altered schedules accordingly. 

 

As for the monthly billing data question at the beginnning of this thread, if you're dealing with a building and climate where monthly variability in occupancy and weather are driving changes in energy consumption in smooth, continuous fashion, you can make some other approximations. We've used a simplified slope method, where you calculate the slope in usage between the two adjacent billing months, i.e. if period 1 is 1000 kWh/day, period 2 is 1100 kWh/day, and period 3 is 1200 kWh/day, and all are 30 days long, you wind up with a slope of 3.33 kWh/day. We then assign daily kWh for each month using this slope and then reslice the data to match our calendar months. This is important when you are calibrating an aggregate model, which is a common need for us when we're estimating program-level savings for an ECM. For example, we're using a building simulation model to extrapolate measured consumption at a large sample of sites to usage in a typical year. 

 

Alternatively, for individual buildings, we don't worry about it and just calibrate to the billing periods instead. We're not generally working in eQuest, but rather with the hourly output of whatever engine we're using. 

 

One thing I've been wondering about recently is how to avoid over-calibration. The econometrics/statty/mathy folks I occasionally consort with talk a lot about overfitting of regressions and the same problem applies here. Has anybody ever tried reserving part of their calibration data set to use as a test set? I've gotten some things that looked like really great calibrations in the past, but I'm wondering how folks have sought to prove whether they were getting things right or overfitting. When I teach junior staff about this sort of thing, I always include something about not getting too cute. I point them to the John Von Neumann quote:

?         With four parameters I can fit an  <https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Elephant> elephant, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk.

Jim and all,

 

We have incentive programs in NY (Multifamily Performance Program) and NJ (Pay for Performance Program for C&I buildings, P4P) that require developing calibrated models to estimate ECM savings. Both programs rely on spreadsheet-based tools to facilitate model calibration, and require that the proposed ECM package reduces overall energy consumption by at least 15%. The programs have been around for 5+ years, and have hundreds of participating projects. Part of the incentive is awarded based on the projected (i.e. modeled) savings, and the rest (as much as 50% for P4P) based on the actual achieved savings established using Whole Building approach by comparing pre/post utility bills. 

 

My biggest take away from the involvement with these programs was that a calibrated model that meets MBE,  CVRMSE, and uncertainty requirements of Guideline 14 may produce grossly incorrect ECM savings. It is not feasible to create a calibrated model that can be reliably used to project savings from any conceivable ECM in a commercial non-research setting because, aside from the modeling effort, it would require a lot of very detailed field work. On the other hand, developing a calibrated simulation to estimate savings from a particular set of measures considered for a given project is a much more manageable task. So the bulk of the recent updates to the technical requirements of our incentive programs were focused on itemizing parameters that should be tweaked to achieve calibration depending on the ECMs included in the project scope. For example, if project involves boiler replacement, efficiency of existing boilers that are being replaced must be measured. (We had a project which modeled existing boiler as 35% efficient because that produced calibrated simulation. Of course such model would very likely exaggerate savings from installing a new boiler.) 

 

Do any of you know references that outline calibration techniques depending on the ECMs being modeled, beyond the general advice included in IPM&VP?

 

Thanks,

 

Maria

I'm encouraged to see so many people addressing this topic because it means you are modeling existing buildings; a lot of work is needed in this arena.  Keep it up!

 

We, as usual, have a spreadsheet solution.  In this case, the spreadsheet is happy to use billing periods of any length, such as is normal for day-of-reading variations, but also to combine "estimated" readings into a period that has an actual reading at each end.

It requires that you tell EnergyPlus to report hourly meter data for each fuel (e.g., electricity and natural gas).  A macro totals that data into the billing periods for your site, displays the predicted vs actual energy and calculates an R-squared value for each fuel and the total. An example is shown below.

Hello all,

 

We usually do the following to calibrate model to monthly utility bills:

1)      Create or purchase weather file corresponding to pre-retrofit period for which we have billing data. Lately we?ve been using WeatherAnalytics files, which we found to be more cost effective than creating our own (they charge $40 for an annual file).

2)      Run simulation using this weather file instead of TMY.

3)      Standard simulation reports (we typically use eQUEST) show usage by calendar month (e.g. January, February, etc.) which is usually not aligned with dates of utility bills, as noted in the question that started this thread. As Brian mentioned in one of the earlier posts, this may be circumvented by entering the actual meter read dates into eQUEST as shown in the screenshot below. This will align usages shown in eQUEST?s ?E*? reports such as ES-E with the actual utility bills.  The approach does not allow entering more than one read date per month (e.g. we can?t capture April 3 ? 28 bill). For projects where this limitation is an issue we generate hourly reports that show consumption by end use for each meter in the project, and aggregate it into periods that are aligned with utility bills. 



  

4)      We then copy simulation outputs (either from ES-E or hourly reports, depending on the method used) into a standard spreadsheet with utility data. The spreadsheet is set up to plot side by side monthly utility bills and simulated usage, and also calculates normalized mean bias error (NMBE) and variance CV(RMSE).   

5)      If we did not to where we want to be with NMBE and CV(RMSE) we adjust and re-run the model, and re-paste results into the same spreadsheet. 

 

In my experience regression analysis using weather as independent variable (i.e. running model with TMY file and normalizing for difference in weather) or relying on HDD to allocate usage to billing periods can be very misleading, mainly because on many projects weather is not the main driver of consumption. For example energy usage of a school during a given time period depends much more on vacation schedule than outdoor dry bulb temperatures.  

 

Thanks,

Hello Joe,

 

Yes, you can count the degree days and regress against that to show a correlation. However, one will get a better "fit" to the weather data if you regress to the degree day that is calculated for the balance point temperature of the building -- hence the inverse model toolkit or the variable based degree day method.

 

PRISM actually calculates the degree days to a variety of change points and actually provides a table for each location that you use as a look up. The IMT will actually perform a variable based degree day calculation that agrees well with PRISM. IMT will also provide you with the average daily temperature for the billing period.

 

When using DOE-2 for actual billing periods, one will have to extract the appropriate hourly variable, sum it to daily and then regroup to align with the billing periods. Here's a chunk of code that will create a dummy plant, display PV-A, PS-A, PS-E and BEPS, and extract the relevant hourly variables to normalize the BEPS to the utility bills:

Maybe I'm missing something here, but why can't you just count up the degree days for the utility period?
I hope you're not working with average or "typical year" degree days, but the degree days from the same time period.

I also recall that the old Princeton Scorekeeping Method (PRISM) back in the 1980's allows the user to enter the degree days for that time period, so it's not a new problem.

When calibrating an energy model to utility bills the utility bills often don?t align with the month start and end.  I have reviewed a couple methods to calendar normalize the utility bills but find them somewhat unsatisfactory.

 

For example the method I am looking at does the following:

The April gas bill runs from March 25 ? April 24.  The algorithm takes the average number of m3 per day from that bill, applies it to the days in April.  Then it takes the average number of days from the May bill which runs from April 24 ? May 25 and applies that average to the remaining days in April.  

 

The issue is that the March-April period has much higher HDD than the April-May period and the ?normalized? gas usage is significantly lower than the simulation data for April.

 

I am wondering if there are any papers or other sources of information as to how others approach this problem.

Hello Maria,



Thanks for actually reading Guideline 14-2014. However, I'm sorry to disagree, but Section 5.3.3.3.7 in Guideline 14-2014 seems pretty clear to me (...since I had a hand in writing it). In fact, I can't imagine doing a calibrated simulation without checking the defaults (as a minimum). Unfortunately, understanding the performance curves of the installed equipment can be tricky since few if any systems installed today come with factory-generated performance curves that are plug-and-play with simulation curve inputs. However, I think Guideline 14 is right in shining a light on this issue. Don't forget, one of the purposes of a guideline is to bring issues to the surface so knowledgeable users can decide to do something or justify why they did not do it.



In the same light, the advice in Section 5.3.3.3.6 also seems reasonable (....I think I wrote this too...). If you have actual blower door or duct blaster measurements, then these would be preferred over an empirical adjustment. There are many studies out there that used the "brute force" ACH adjustment for infiltration, which can improve a model's fit after all other variables are considered.



Your suggestion to more closely link the calibrated simulation to  the intended ECM is reasonable. In fact, now that Guideline 14 is published, we'll probably be starting in on the "next version" in a year or so and I would invite you to join the Committee.



Jeff


PS: Did you download and try the software that now comes with Guideline 14-2014?...this includes the IMT from RP1050 and Diversity Factor toolkit from RP1093.

Jim,

FYI attached is a presentation from 2014 ASRHAE/IBPSA summarizing our findings on accuracy of the calibrated simulations based on projects that went through an incentive program in NJ. (You presented there also ? loved your Sherlock Holmes hat and pipe :).) To clarify the language, ECM savings estimated via calibrated simulation are referred in the presentation as ?projected savings?; ECM savings estimated via ?whole building? approach are referred to as ?realized savings?.  Slide 7 summarizes high level results ? while there was a relatively good alignment between the total projected and realized savings for the entire sample, individual projects were all over the map.

I agree with your last point below that the greatest source of error is too little measured data, but given the finite budget that each project has, I hoped that documents such as Guideline 14 would emphasize the link between the minimum scope of measurements and ECMs considered for a given project. For example Guidelines 14 says the following concerning simulation defaults, which in my opinion is impractical:

5.3.3.3.7 Minimizing Default Values. Check and thoroughly
understand all default input variables in the simulation
program, as many of the default values have little resemblance
to the actual building being simulated. The fewer the
number of default values used, the more representative the
simulation will be?but only if the changes are well reasoned.
This also includes inspection of the default performance
curves of the various systems and plant equipment, because
such curves can significantly impact the results of the simulation.
Any program default values that are altered, however,
should be well documented.

There is also a section on adjusting infiltration / ventilation rates to calibrate the model (quoted below), but it should only apply if project does not include ECMs involving air-sealing (which are common in multifamily and school projects) or ventilation controls such as DCV. If project includes infiltration or ventilation related measures, the related inputs cannot be used to calibrate the model even as ?a last resort?.

5.3.3.3.6 Estimating Infiltration Rates. Infiltration
rates are difficult to measure and may be treated as an
unknown that is iteratively solved with the simulation program
once the other major parameters are determined. This
approach is only recommended as a last resort. To solve for
the infiltration rate and/or the ventilation rate iteratively, conduct
a series of simulation runs such that only the infiltration
and/or ventilation rates are changed from one-tenth to as
much as ten times the expected rates. Next, compare the simulation
outputs produced to the measured building data as discussed
below. In addition, supporting evidence should be
used to justify the final choice of variables.

I think calibrated simulation should be treated as an extension of retrofit isolation approach, and site measurements performed in support of simulation must at minimum include (a) parameters that are modified to model ECM savings, and (b) simulation inputs that do not change but drive ECM savings. For lighting fixture replacement ECM, pre-retrofit wattage would be an example of (a), and lighting runtime hours would be an example of (b). On the other hand, if there are no ECMs that reduce base load (e.g. plug load, lighting, etc.), but there are ECMs involving HVAC controls, site measurements should focus on operation of existing controls, and establishing existing lighting wattage is not necessary because model calibrated to capture the overall base load (lighting + plug loads) usage may be good enough in this case. We had to develop guidelines for incentive programs that rely on calibrated simulation to specify minimum scope of measurements and acceptable ?estimated? inputs for each common ECM type. I hope that a similar guidance would be included at some point in one of ASHRAE standards / guidelines. As it stands now, there is a sea of difference between the specificity of simulation requirements in 90.1 Appendix G compared to calibrated simulation of existing buildings. Unless I am missing some key reference?

Excellent insights in this thread!
Our "two cents":

  *   We measure key variables such as larger motor kW and outdoor airflow.  The idea is to eliminate uncertainty for energy aspects that we know are "big".  Because it's easy to obtain, we use the actual weather data.  It's not always a big impact, but eliminates needless uncertainty.

I'll second that this has turned into a really good thread. My personal rule of thumb in doing calibration is, "don't mess with things that relate directly to an ECM." If you have a retrofit ECM going on, you should have detailed data on the pre-installation conditions associated with that ECM. If that isn't documented, your model is never going to provide you with accurate savings results. It pays to think about these things at the fundamental level. And also apply a reasonableness range to those values. What am I most unsure about? What's the possible range of this value? Personally, I twist my dials all in one direction and then use setpoint as my fine calibration factor at the end. We need to remember that we're using models as tools to help guide decision-making. When we make decisions in calibration, we should think about how it will impact the decision being made -- does it impose a bias (like the 35% assumed pre-retrofit boiler efficiency for a boiler retrofit project)? These models are just tools for extrapolating from known energy consumption data to unknown energy consumption data.

An earlier post commented that hourly data might make calibration easier... It doesn't make it easier in the sense of less work, but it does make your model a lot better if you do it right. Calibrating models to real hourly consumption data tells you so much about what is likely wrong with your model and so much about how your real building performs. If you have hourly end use data, or close, then you are really in business. At the aggregate level, this kind of data can tell you that you didn't really know much to start with. For one project for Con Edison, we had access to hourly whole-premise consumption data for several thousand NYC buildings by building type. We were able to use this data to uncover that our models vastly underestimated consumption at nights and on weekends. We didn't know why, but we altered schedules accordingly.

As for the monthly billing data question at the beginnning of this thread, if you're dealing with a building and climate where monthly variability in occupancy and weather are driving changes in energy consumption in smooth, continuous fashion, you can make some other approximations. We've used a simplified slope method, where you calculate the slope in usage between the two adjacent billing months, i.e. if period 1 is 1000 kWh/day, period 2 is 1100 kWh/day, and period 3 is 1200 kWh/day, and all are 30 days long, you wind up with a slope of 3.33 kWh/day. We then assign daily kWh for each month using this slope and then reslice the data to match our calendar months. This is important when you are calibrating an aggregate model, which is a common need for us when we're estimating program-level savings for an ECM. For example, we're using a building simulation model to extrapolate measured consumption at a large sample of sites to usage in a typical year.

Alternatively, for individual buildings, we don't worry about it and just calibrate to the billing periods instead. We're not generally working in eQuest, but rather with the hourly output of whatever engine we're using.

One thing I've been wondering about recently is how to avoid over-calibration. The econometrics/statty/mathy folks I occasionally consort with talk a lot about overfitting of regressions and the same problem applies here. Has anybody ever tried reserving part of their calibration data set to use as a test set? I've gotten some things that looked like really great calibrations in the past, but I'm wondering how folks have sought to prove whether they were getting things right or overfitting. When I teach junior staff about this sort of thing, I always include something about not getting too cute. I point them to the John Von Neumann quote:
?         With four parameters I can fit an elephant<https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Elephant>, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk.

Jim and all,

We have incentive programs in NY (Multifamily Performance Program) and NJ (Pay for Performance Program for C&I buildings, P4P) that require developing calibrated models to estimate ECM savings. Both programs rely on spreadsheet-based tools to facilitate model calibration, and require that the proposed ECM package reduces overall energy consumption by at least 15%. The programs have been around for 5+ years, and have hundreds of participating projects. Part of the incentive is awarded based on the projected (i.e. modeled) savings, and the rest (as much as 50% for P4P) based on the actual achieved savings established using Whole Building approach by comparing pre/post utility bills.

My biggest take away from the involvement with these programs was that a calibrated model that meets MBE,  CVRMSE, and uncertainty requirements of Guideline 14 may produce grossly incorrect ECM savings. It is not feasible to create a calibrated model that can be reliably used to project savings from any conceivable ECM in a commercial non-research setting because, aside from the modeling effort, it would require a lot of very detailed field work. On the other hand, developing a calibrated simulation to estimate savings from a particular set of measures considered for a given project is a much more manageable task. So the bulk of the recent updates to the technical requirements of our incentive programs were focused on itemizing parameters that should be tweaked to achieve calibration depending on the ECMs included in the project scope. For example, if project involves boiler replacement, efficiency of existing boilers that are being replaced must be measured. (We had a project which modeled existing boiler as 35% efficient because that produced calibrated simulation. Of course such model would very likely exaggerate savings from installing a new boiler.)

Do any of you know references that outline calibration techniques depending on the ECMs being modeled, beyond the general advice included in IPM&VP?

Thanks,

Maria

I'm encouraged to see so many people addressing this topic because it means you are modeling existing buildings; a lot of work is needed in this arena.  Keep it up!

We, as usual, have a spreadsheet solution.  In this case, the spreadsheet is happy to use billing periods of any length, such as is normal for day-of-reading variations, but also to combine "estimated" readings into a period that has an actual reading at each end.
It requires that you tell EnergyPlus to report hourly meter data for each fuel (e.g., electricity and natural gas).  A macro totals that data into the billing periods for your site, displays the predicted vs actual energy and calculates an R-squared value for each fuel and the total. An example is shown below.

Hello all,

We usually do the following to calibrate model to monthly utility bills:

1)      Create or purchase weather file corresponding to pre-retrofit period for which we have billing data. Lately we?ve been using WeatherAnalytics files, which we found to be more cost effective than creating our own (they charge $40 for an annual file).

2)      Run simulation using this weather file instead of TMY.

3)      Standard simulation reports (we typically use eQUEST) show usage by calendar month (e.g. January, February, etc.) which is usually not aligned with dates of utility bills, as noted in the question that started this thread. As Brian mentioned in one of the earlier posts, this may be circumvented by entering the actual meter read dates into eQUEST as shown in the screenshot below. This will align usages shown in eQUEST?s ?E*? reports such as ES-E with the actual utility bills.  The approach does not allow entering more than one read date per month (e.g. we can?t capture April 3 ? 28 bill). For projects where this limitation is an issue we generate hourly reports that show consumption by end use for each meter in the project, and aggregate it into periods that are aligned with utility bills.

[cid:image002.png at 01D0AF2E.9BDDDFB0]



4)      We then copy simulation outputs (either from ES-E or hourly reports, depending on the method used) into a standard spreadsheet with utility data. The spreadsheet is set up to plot side by side monthly utility bills and simulated usage, and also calculates normalized mean bias error (NMBE) and variance CV(RMSE).

5)      If we did not to where we want to be with NMBE and CV(RMSE) we adjust and re-run the model, and re-paste results into the same spreadsheet.

In my experience regression analysis using weather as independent variable (i.e. running model with TMY file and normalizing for difference in weather) or relying on HDD to allocate usage to billing periods can be very misleading, mainly because on many projects weather is not the main driver of consumption. For example energy usage of a school during a given time period depends much more on vacation schedule than outdoor dry bulb temperatures.

Hello Joe,



Yes, you can count the degree days and regress against that to show a correlation. However, one will get a better "fit" to the weather data if you regress to the degree day that is calculated for the balance point temperature of the building -- hence the inverse model toolkit or the variable based degree day method.



PRISM actually calculates the degree days to a variety of change points and actually provides a table for each location that you use as a look up. The IMT will actually perform a variable based degree day calculation that agrees well with PRISM. IMT will also provide you with the average daily temperature for the billing period.



When using DOE-2 for actual billing periods, one will have to extract the appropriate hourly variable, sum it to daily and then regroup to align with the billing periods. Here's a chunk of code that will create a dummy plant, display PV-A, PS-A, PS-E and BEPS, and extract the relevant hourly variables to normalize the BEPS to the utility bills:

Maybe I'm missing something here, but why can't you just count up the degree days for the utility period?
I hope you're not working with average or "typical year" degree days, but the degree days from the same time period.

I also recall that the old Princeton Scorekeeping Method (PRISM) back in the 1980's allows the user to enter the degree days for that time period, so it's not a new problem.

When calibrating an energy model to utility bills the utility bills often don?t align with the month start and end.  I have reviewed a couple methods to calendar normalize the utility bills but find them somewhat unsatisfactory.

For example the method I am looking at does the following:
The April gas bill runs from March 25 ? April 24.  The algorithm takes the average number of m3 per day from that bill, applies it to the days in April.  Then it takes the average number of days from the May bill which runs from April 24 ? May 25 and applies that average to the remaining days in April.

The issue is that the March-April period has much higher HDD than the April-May period and the ?normalized? gas usage is significantly lower than the simulation data for April.

I am wondering if there are any papers or other sources of information as to how others approach this problem.

Since we have your ear Jeff, I have wondered if Guideline 14 describes any penalty to apply to the goodness of fit metric when allowing unknown parameters to be varied to improve the fit to monthly data?  Something like how adjusted R-squared or AIC penalize models with more parameters?  It seems that if you achieve a given level of goodness of fit after fiddling with a bunch of parameters then that is not as good as achieving the same level of fit with fewer free parameters.  Is there any way to estimate the number of degrees of freedom lost when changing a single numeric model parameter like ACH vs a more complicated one like changing out entire HVAC curves?

Hello Maria,



Thanks for actually reading Guideline 14-2014. However, I'm sorry to disagree, but Section 5.3.3.3.7 in Guideline 14-2014 seems pretty clear to me (...since I had a hand in writing it). In fact, I can't imagine doing a calibrated simulation without checking the defaults (as a minimum). Unfortunately, understanding the performance curves of the installed equipment can be tricky since few if any systems installed today come with factory-generated performance curves that are plug-and-play with simulation curve inputs. However, I think Guideline 14 is right in shining a light on this issue. Don't forget, one of the purposes of a guideline is to bring issues to the surface so knowledgeable users can decide to do something or justify why they did not do it.



In the same light, the advice in Section 5.3.3.3.6 also seems reasonable (....I think I wrote this too...). If you have actual blower door or duct blaster measurements, then these would be preferred over an empirical adjustment. There are many studies out there that used the "brute force" ACH adjustment for infiltration, which can improve a model's fit after all other variables are considered.



Your suggestion to more closely link the calibrated simulation to  the intended ECM is reasonable. In fact, now that Guideline 14 is published, we'll probably be starting in on the "next version" in a year or so and I would invite you to join the Committee.



Jeff


PS: Did you download and try the software that now comes with Guideline 14-2014?...this includes the IMT from RP1050 and Diversity Factor toolkit from RP1093.

Jim,

FYI attached is a presentation from 2014 ASRHAE/IBPSA summarizing our findings on accuracy of the calibrated simulations based on projects that went through an incentive program in NJ. (You presented there also ? loved your Sherlock Holmes hat and pipe :).) To clarify the language, ECM savings estimated via calibrated simulation are referred in the presentation as ?projected savings?; ECM savings estimated via ?whole building? approach are referred to as ?realized savings?.  Slide 7 summarizes high level results ? while there was a relatively good alignment between the total projected and realized savings for the entire sample, individual projects were all over the map.

I agree with your last point below that the greatest source of error is too little measured data, but given the finite budget that each project has, I hoped that documents such as Guideline 14 would emphasize the link between the minimum scope of measurements and ECMs considered for a given project. For example Guidelines 14 says the following concerning simulation defaults, which in my opinion is impractical:

5.3.3.3.7 Minimizing Default Values. Check and thoroughly
understand all default input variables in the simulation
program, as many of the default values have little resemblance
to the actual building being simulated. The fewer the
number of default values used, the more representative the
simulation will be?but only if the changes are well reasoned.
This also includes inspection of the default performance
curves of the various systems and plant equipment, because
such curves can significantly impact the results of the simulation.
Any program default values that are altered, however,
should be well documented.

There is also a section on adjusting infiltration / ventilation rates to calibrate the model (quoted below), but it should only apply if project does not include ECMs involving air-sealing (which are common in multifamily and school projects) or ventilation controls such as DCV. If project includes infiltration or ventilation related measures, the related inputs cannot be used to calibrate the model even as ?a last resort?.

5.3.3.3.6 Estimating Infiltration Rates. Infiltration
rates are difficult to measure and may be treated as an
unknown that is iteratively solved with the simulation program
once the other major parameters are determined. This
approach is only recommended as a last resort. To solve for
the infiltration rate and/or the ventilation rate iteratively, conduct
a series of simulation runs such that only the infiltration
and/or ventilation rates are changed from one-tenth to as
much as ten times the expected rates. Next, compare the simulation
outputs produced to the measured building data as discussed
below. In addition, supporting evidence should be
used to justify the final choice of variables.

I think calibrated simulation should be treated as an extension of retrofit isolation approach, and site measurements performed in support of simulation must at minimum include (a) parameters that are modified to model ECM savings, and (b) simulation inputs that do not change but drive ECM savings. For lighting fixture replacement ECM, pre-retrofit wattage would be an example of (a), and lighting runtime hours would be an example of (b). On the other hand, if there are no ECMs that reduce base load (e.g. plug load, lighting, etc.), but there are ECMs involving HVAC controls, site measurements should focus on operation of existing controls, and establishing existing lighting wattage is not necessary because model calibrated to capture the overall base load (lighting + plug loads) usage may be good enough in this case. We had to develop guidelines for incentive programs that rely on calibrated simulation to specify minimum scope of measurements and acceptable ?estimated? inputs for each common ECM type. I hope that a similar guidance would be included at some point in one of ASHRAE standards / guidelines. As it stands now, there is a sea of difference between the specificity of simulation requirements in 90.1 Appendix G compared to calibrated simulation of existing buildings. Unless I am missing some key reference?

Really! You think I can answer that? That's bordering on the Holy Grail.

Of course, you're right in asking the question, and in my mind that's a good question to ask. Although, in my experience, I have never had all the measured data I need to answer it  for a given building. So, I guess it is always an uphill battle.

I think the closest thing I've ever seen to having a 'rational method' that calibrated a simulation to specific, measured data for individual parameters is the PSTAR/BEVA method that Kris Subbarao developed in the 1990s, motivated to some extend by the ETP models that Sondereggar developed in the 1970s.  This method worked well for residences because it  required the user to go and measure specific things that plugged into certain variables in the simplified model. However, I'm not aware that the method was successfully extended to a general purpose model for commercial buildings.

Nevertheless, we can and do learn from it. For example, the calibration procedure developed by Hsieh and Norford in the 1980s was developed for a commercial building and is at the heart of the guidance in Guideline 14. Namely, measure the electric loads into the building and force the model to use the measured results. Then, see if the accuracy improves or not, and adjust as needed. Amazingly, this single variable has a large impact on improving the accuracy.

Next, check to see if you have the appropriate system and the temperature settings/schedules of the HVAC system to see if it improves things. This was also proposed by Hsieh and Norford as well as Kaplan in his Energy Edge paper.

Finally, use Manke and Hittle's method to exercise the model inputs and see what other variables need tuning.

I personally prefer to use canned graphs to 'see' the calibration as well as statistics to judge the final outcome.

Hope this helps.

Since we have your ear Jeff, I have wondered if Guideline 14 describes any penalty to apply to the goodness of fit metric when allowing unknown parameters to be varied to improve the fit to monthly data?  Something like how adjusted R-squared or AIC penalize models with more parameters?  It seems that if you achieve a given level of goodness of fit after fiddling with a bunch of parameters then that is not as good as achieving the same level of fit with fewer free parameters.  Is there any way to estimate the number of degrees of freedom lost when changing a single numeric model parameter like ACH vs a more complicated one like changing out entire HVAC curves?

Hello Maria,



Thanks for actually reading Guideline 14-2014. However, I'm sorry to disagree, but Section 5.3.3.3.7 in Guideline 14-2014 seems pretty clear to me (...since I had a hand in writing it). In fact, I can't imagine doing a calibrated simulation without checking the defaults (as a minimum). Unfortunately, understanding the performance curves of the installed equipment can be tricky since few if any systems installed today come with factory-generated performance curves that are plug-and-play with simulation curve inputs. However, I think Guideline 14 is right in shining a light on this issue. Don't forget, one of the purposes of a guideline is to bring issues to the surface so knowledgeable users can decide to do something or justify why they did not do it.



In the same light, the advice in Section 5.3.3.3.6 also seems reasonable (....I think I wrote this too...). If you have actual blower door or duct blaster measurements, then these would be preferred over an empirical adjustment. There are many studies out there that used the "brute force" ACH adjustment for infiltration, which can improve a model's fit after all other variables are considered.



Your suggestion to more closely link the calibrated simulation to  the intended ECM is reasonable. In fact, now that Guideline 14 is published, we'll probably be starting in on the "next version" in a year or so and I would invite you to join the Committee.



Jeff

Jim,

FYI attached is a presentation from 2014 ASRHAE/IBPSA summarizing our findings on accuracy of the calibrated simulations based on projects that went through an incentive program in NJ. (You presented there also ? loved your Sherlock Holmes hat and pipe :).) To clarify the language, ECM savings estimated via calibrated simulation are referred in the presentation as ?projected savings?; ECM savings estimated via ?whole building? approach are referred to as ?realized savings?.  Slide 7 summarizes high level results ? while there was a relatively good alignment between the total projected and realized savings for the entire sample, individual projects were all over the map.

I agree with your last point below that the greatest source of error is too little measured data, but given the finite budget that each project has, I hoped that documents such as Guideline 14 would emphasize the link between the minimum scope of measurements and ECMs considered for a given project. For example Guidelines 14 says the following concerning simulation defaults, which in my opinion is impractical:

5.3.3.3.7 Minimizing Default Values. Check and thoroughly
understand all default input variables in the simulation
program, as many of the default values have little resemblance
to the actual building being simulated. The fewer the
number of default values used, the more representative the
simulation will be?but only if the changes are well reasoned.
This also includes inspection of the default performance
curves of the various systems and plant equipment, because
such curves can significantly impact the results of the simulation.
Any program default values that are altered, however,
should be well documented.

There is also a section on adjusting infiltration / ventilation rates to calibrate the model (quoted below), but it should only apply if project does not include ECMs involving air-sealing (which are common in multifamily and school projects) or ventilation controls such as DCV. If project includes infiltration or ventilation related measures, the related inputs cannot be used to calibrate the model even as ?a last resort?.

Excellent insights in this thread!
Our "two cents":

 *   We measure key variables such as larger motor kW and outdoor airflow.  The idea is to eliminate uncertainty for energy aspects that we know are "big".  Because it's easy to obtain, we use the actual weather data.  It's not always a big impact, but eliminates needless uncertainty.
 *   We don't trust people's memory about almost anything; it's amazing how different the story can be when told by two different people, both of whom should be knowledgeable.
 *   We also don't trust sensor calibration.  Not all sensors matter as much, however; discharge sensors on reheat systems, for example, matter more than room temp sensors.
 *   More data is better.  Smart meters are very helpful, as is trend data if the client has taken time to set them up. Not many do :(
 *   We have not yet tinkered with sensitivity analysis for uncertain variables such as boiler efficiency or infiltration, but we do run GenOpt for the best R-squared fit to each (exact) billing period and review / revise the output for reasonableness.
 *   On the one hand, it bothers me that calibrated models are "grossly incorrect" in Maria's experience.  My bias is that those models may have too little measured data.  On the other hand, this is a brave new world and we probably all have a lot to learn.

I'll second that this has turned into a really good thread. My personal rule of thumb in doing calibration is, "don't mess with things that relate directly to an ECM." If you have a retrofit ECM going on, you should have detailed data on the pre-installation conditions associated with that ECM. If that isn't documented, your model is never going to provide you with accurate savings results. It pays to think about these things at the fundamental level. And also apply a reasonableness range to those values. What am I most unsure about? What's the possible range of this value? Personally, I twist my dials all in one direction and then use setpoint as my fine calibration factor at the end. We need to remember that we're using models as tools to help guide decision-making. When we make decisions in calibration, we should think about how it will impact the decision being made -- does it impose a bias (like the 35% assumed pre-retrofit boiler efficiency for a boiler retrofit project)? These models are just tools for extrapolating from known energy consumption data to unknown energy consumption data.

An earlier post commented that hourly data might make calibration easier... It doesn't make it easier in the sense of less work, but it does make your model a lot better if you do it right. Calibrating models to real hourly consumption data tells you so much about what is likely wrong with your model and so much about how your real building performs. If you have hourly end use data, or close, then you are really in business. At the aggregate level, this kind of data can tell you that you didn't really know much to start with. For one project for Con Edison, we had access to hourly whole-premise consumption data for several thousand NYC buildings by building type. We were able to use this data to uncover that our models vastly underestimated consumption at nights and on weekends. We didn't know why, but we altered schedules accordingly.

As for the monthly billing data question at the beginnning of this thread, if you're dealing with a building and climate where monthly variability in occupancy and weather are driving changes in energy consumption in smooth, continuous fashion, you can make some other approximations. We've used a simplified slope method, where you calculate the slope in usage between the two adjacent billing months, i.e. if period 1 is 1000 kWh/day, period 2 is 1100 kWh/day, and period 3 is 1200 kWh/day, and all are 30 days long, you wind up with a slope of 3.33 kWh/day. We then assign daily kWh for each month using this slope and then reslice the data to match our calendar months. This is important when you are calibrating an aggregate model, which is a common need for us when we're estimating program-level savings for an ECM. For example, we're using a building simulation model to extrapolate measured consumption at a large sample of sites to usage in a typical year.

Alternatively, for individual buildings, we don't worry about it and just calibrate to the billing periods instead. We're not generally working in eQuest, but rather with the hourly output of whatever engine we're using.

One thing I've been wondering about recently is how to avoid over-calibration. The econometrics/statty/mathy folks I occasionally consort with talk a lot about overfitting of regressions and the same problem applies here. Has anybody ever tried reserving part of their calibration data set to use as a test set? I've gotten some things that looked like really great calibrations in the past, but I'm wondering how folks have sought to prove whether they were getting things right or overfitting. When I teach junior staff about this sort of thing, I always include something about not getting too cute. I point them to the John Von Neumann quote:
?         With four parameters I can fit an elephant<https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Elephant>, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk.

Jim and all,

We have incentive programs in NY (Multifamily Performance Program) and NJ (Pay for Performance Program for C&I buildings, P4P) that require developing calibrated models to estimate ECM savings. Both programs rely on spreadsheet-based tools to facilitate model calibration, and require that the proposed ECM package reduces overall energy consumption by at least 15%. The programs have been around for 5+ years, and have hundreds of participating projects. Part of the incentive is awarded based on the projected (i.e. modeled) savings, and the rest (as much as 50% for P4P) based on the actual achieved savings established using Whole Building approach by comparing pre/post utility bills.

My biggest take away from the involvement with these programs was that a calibrated model that meets MBE,  CVRMSE, and uncertainty requirements of Guideline 14 may produce grossly incorrect ECM savings. It is not feasible to create a calibrated model that can be reliably used to project savings from any conceivable ECM in a commercial non-research setting because, aside from the modeling effort, it would require a lot of very detailed field work. On the other hand, developing a calibrated simulation to estimate savings from a particular set of measures considered for a given project is a much more manageable task. So the bulk of the recent updates to the technical requirements of our incentive programs were focused on itemizing parameters that should be tweaked to achieve calibration depending on the ECMs included in the project scope. For example, if project involves boiler replacement, efficiency of existing boilers that are being replaced must be measured. (We had a project which modeled existing boiler as 35% efficient because that produced calibrated simulation. Of course such model would very likely exaggerate savings from installing a new boiler.)

Do any of you know references that outline calibration techniques depending on the ECMs being modeled, beyond the general advice included in IPM&VP?

Thanks,

Maria

I'm encouraged to see so many people addressing this topic because it means you are modeling existing buildings; a lot of work is needed in this arena.  Keep it up!

We, as usual, have a spreadsheet solution.  In this case, the spreadsheet is happy to use billing periods of any length, such as is normal for day-of-reading variations, but also to combine "estimated" readings into a period that has an actual reading at each end.
It requires that you tell EnergyPlus to report hourly meter data for each fuel (e.g., electricity and natural gas).  A macro totals that data into the billing periods for your site, displays the predicted vs actual energy and calculates an R-squared value for each fuel and the total. An example is shown below.

Hello all,

We usually do the following to calibrate model to monthly utility bills:

1)      Create or purchase weather file corresponding to pre-retrofit period for which we have billing data. Lately we?ve been using WeatherAnalytics files, which we found to be more cost effective than creating our own (they charge $40 for an annual file).

2)      Run simulation using this weather file instead of TMY.

3)      Standard simulation reports (we typically use eQUEST) show usage by calendar month (e.g. January, February, etc.) which is usually not aligned with dates of utility bills, as noted in the question that started this thread. As Brian mentioned in one of the earlier posts, this may be circumvented by entering the actual meter read dates into eQUEST as shown in the screenshot below. This will align usages shown in eQUEST?s ?E*? reports such as ES-E with the actual utility bills.  The approach does not allow entering more than one read date per month (e.g. we can?t capture April 3 ? 28 bill). For projects where this limitation is an issue we generate hourly reports that show consumption by end use for each meter in the project, and aggregate it into periods that are aligned with utility bills.

<image002.png>



4)      We then copy simulation outputs (either from ES-E or hourly reports, depending on the method used) into a standard spreadsheet with utility data. The spreadsheet is set up to plot side by side monthly utility bills and simulated usage, and also calculates normalized mean bias error (NMBE) and variance CV(RMSE).

5)      If we did not to where we want to be with NMBE and CV(RMSE) we adjust and re-run the model, and re-paste results into the same spreadsheet.

In my experience regression analysis using weather as independent variable (i.e. running model with TMY file and normalizing for difference in weather) or relying on HDD to allocate usage to billing periods can be very misleading, mainly because on many projects weather is not the main driver of consumption. For example energy usage of a school during a given time period depends much more on vacation schedule than outdoor dry bulb temperatures.

Hello Joe,



Yes, you can count the degree days and regress against that to show a correlation. However, one will get a better "fit" to the weather data if you regress to the degree day that is calculated for the balance point temperature of the building -- hence the inverse model toolkit or the variable based degree day method.



PRISM actually calculates the degree days to a variety of change points and actually provides a table for each location that you use as a look up. The IMT will actually perform a variable based degree day calculation that agrees well with PRISM. IMT will also provide you with the average daily temperature for the billing period.



When using DOE-2 for actual billing periods, one will have to extract the appropriate hourly variable, sum it to daily and then regroup to align with the billing periods. Here's a chunk of code that will create a dummy plant, display PV-A, PS-A, PS-E and BEPS, and extract the relevant hourly variables to normalize the BEPS to the utility bills:

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Energy model calibration - normalizing the utility bills to month start-end
Maybe I'm missing something here, but why can't you just count up the degree days for the utility period?
I hope you're not working with average or "typical year" degree days, but the degree days from the same time period.

I also recall that the old Princeton Scorekeeping Method (PRISM) back in the 1980's allows the user to enter the degree days for that time period, so it's not a new problem.

When calibrating an energy model to utility bills the utility bills often don?t align with the month start and end.  I have reviewed a couple methods to calendar normalize the utility bills but find them somewhat unsatisfactory.

For example the method I am looking at does the following:
The April gas bill runs from March 25 ? April 24.  The algorithm takes the average number of m3 per day from that bill, applies it to the days in April.  Then it takes the average number of days from the May bill which runs from April 24 ? May 25 and applies that average to the remaining days in April.

The issue is that the March-April period has much higher HDD than the April-May period and the ?normalized? gas usage is significantly lower than the simulation data for April.

I am wondering if there are any papers or other sources of information as to how others approach this problem.

Jeff,

 

Guideline 14 has been my favorite read for some years now J, and was one of the key resources used for developing technical requirements for a number of modeling-based incentive programs for existing buildings here in North East. My comments come from witnessing its application on a mass scale, involving hundreds of projects, over 7-8 years, with modeling done by dozens of different companies. Program participants have to comply  with the Simulation Guidelines that reiterate key concepts of Guideline 14 and IPM&VP related to calibrated simulation in a more enforceable language. A few years into running these programs it became clear that, to avoid repeating the same comments again and again when reviewing submitted reports, and to ensure that projected ECM savings (and claimed incentive $) were reasonable, we needed to expand the guidelines to address measure-specific modeling requirements. These requirements cover simulation inputs that should be obtained via measurements for a range of common ECMs, and defaults that must be used if measurements were not performed, to ensure that projected savings were conservative.   

 

You wrote that ??There are many studies out there that used the "brute force" ACH adjustment for infiltration, which can improve a model's fit after all other variables are considered.? Adjusting ACH is indeed very common and often the quickest way to meet MBE & CV RMSE, and many of the programs? participants did just that. Projects that included air-sealing ECM would then estimate savings by reducing the ACH in the calibrated model by a certain (usually generous) percentage. To combat the issue, our program?s guidelines require that projects itemize the scope of air-sealing work, and use a spreadsheet developed based on a table from 2001 ASHRAE Fundamentals to convert it to equivalent ACH reduction. The ASHRAE table listed ELA associated with a wide range of building components in various states of disrepair, e.g. un-caulked wood doorframe and caulked wood door frame. The tool used the data to calculate ELA reduction from air sealing scope (e.g. caulking a doorframe), and then converted it to equivalent ACH reduction, discounting for effects of ventilation. This delta ACH can then be incorporated into simulation to capture ECM savings. We also limited pre-retrofit ACH that can be entered when calibrating the model. For example, if it took ACH 5 to get a good model fit, then report should identify areas of significant air leakage and include related ECMs. Alternatively, if a building appears to be relatively tight, another parameter(s) affecting heating/cooling load must be investigated and used to calibrate the model; these parameters may also be considered for improvement.   

 

You also wrote that ??. I can't imagine doing a calibrated simulation without checking the defaults (as a minimum).? Some 90.1- compliant tools give users much more flexibility in defining systems, and consequently have many more editable defaults, compared to others where more parameters are hard-coded in software?s algorithms. So requiring that all defaults are checked, aside from penalizing users of more flexible tools, will not ensure consistent quality of results across projects. I think a more practical alternative would be to require checking defaults (or using actual measured data) for areas that drive ECM savings, and define these areas for common types of ECMs. For example, if a calibrated model is used to estimate savings from exhaust air energy recovery ECM, then defaults related to design and OA flow and schedule, recovery effectiveness, fan efficiency, pressure drop associated with  recovery device, etc. must be edited to match site conditions and proposed new equipment. 90.1 ECB / App G compliance form asks for a ?Number of defaults overridden?, which was also incorporated into early LEED EAp2/c1 templates. This question always puzzled me ? how do you count this for say an eQUEST model? And as submittal reviewer, would you flag projects with too many over-written defaults, or too few over-written defaults? Or do you check for similar number of over-written defaults between baseline and proposed model?

 

To summarize, I think Guideline 14 is a great resource, but am disappointed with the pace of its development. With one ASHRAE president using ?Sustaining our Future by Rebuilding our Past? as a theme of his presidency, and another ?Modeling a Sustainable World? as a theme of hers, I was hoping for a much more substantial update to the calibrated simulation portion of the guideline given that 12 years have passed since its last release. For example, 2014 version has 5+ pages of normative references and bibliography, including research papers from 1980s. Seems like there was plenty of time to pull actionable findings from these papers into the main body of the guideline? I?d be happy to help with the development and would love an opportunity to join the committee. I actually reached out to some of the authors of the guideline a while back (I am not going to name names J), but did not get much of a response. And then I overlooked public comment opportunity, so have no right to complain J.

Really! You think I can answer that? That's bordering on the Holy Grail. 

 

Of course, you're right in asking the question, and in my mind that's a good question to ask. Although, in my experience, I have never had all the measured data I need to answer it  for a given building. So, I guess it is always an uphill battle. 

 

I think the closest thing I've ever seen to having a 'rational method' that calibrated a simulation to specific, measured data for individual parameters is the PSTAR/BEVA method that Kris Subbarao developed in the 1990s, motivated to some extend by the ETP models that Sondereggar developed in the 1970s.  This method worked well for residences because it  required the user to go and measure specific things that plugged into certain variables in the simplified model. However, I'm not aware that the method was successfully extended to a general purpose model for commercial buildings. 

Nevertheless, we can and do learn from it. For example, the calibration procedure developed by Hsieh and Norford in the 1980s was developed for a commercial building and is at the heart of the guidance in Guideline 14. Namely, measure the electric loads into the building and force the model to use the measured results. Then, see if the accuracy improves or not, and adjust as needed. Amazingly, this single variable has a large impact on improving the accuracy. 

 

Next, check to see if you have the appropriate system and the temperature settings/schedules of the HVAC system to see if it improves things. This was also proposed by Hsieh and Norford as well as Kaplan in his Energy Edge paper. 

 

Finally, use Manke and Hittle's method to exercise the model inputs and see what other variables need tuning. 

 

I personally prefer to use canned graphs to 'see' the calibration as well as statistics to judge the final outcome. 

 

Hope this helps.

Since we have your ear Jeff, I have wondered if Guideline 14 describes any penalty to apply to the goodness of fit metric when allowing unknown parameters to be varied to improve the fit to monthly data?  Something like how adjusted R-squared or AIC penalize models with more parameters?  It seems that if you achieve a given level of goodness of fit after fiddling with a bunch of parameters then that is not as good as achieving the same level of fit with fewer free parameters.  Is there any way to estimate the number of degrees of freedom lost when changing a single numeric model parameter like ACH vs a more complicated one like changing out entire HVAC curves?

Hello Maria,



Thanks for actually reading Guideline 14-2014. However, I'm sorry to disagree, but Section 5.3.3.3.7 in Guideline 14-2014 seems pretty clear to me (...since I had a hand in writing it). In fact, I can't imagine doing a calibrated simulation without checking the defaults (as a minimum). Unfortunately, understanding the performance curves of the installed equipment can be tricky since few if any systems installed today come with factory-generated performance curves that are plug-and-play with simulation curve inputs. However, I think Guideline 14 is right in shining a light on this issue. Don't forget, one of the purposes of a guideline is to bring issues to the surface so knowledgeable users can decide to do something or justify why they did not do it.



In the same light, the advice in Section 5.3.3.3.6 also seems reasonable (....I think I wrote this too...). If you have actual blower door or duct blaster measurements, then these would be preferred over an empirical adjustment. There are many studies out there that used the "brute force" ACH adjustment for infiltration, which can improve a model's fit after all other variables are considered.



Your suggestion to more closely link the calibrated simulation to  the intended ECM is reasonable. In fact, now that Guideline 14 is published, we'll probably be starting in on the "next version" in a year or so and I would invite you to join the Committee.



Jeff

Jim,

FYI attached is a presentation from 2014 ASRHAE/IBPSA summarizing our findings on accuracy of the calibrated simulations based on projects that went through an incentive program in NJ. (You presented there also ? loved your Sherlock Holmes hat and pipe :).) To clarify the language, ECM savings estimated via calibrated simulation are referred in the presentation as ?projected savings?; ECM savings estimated via ?whole building? approach are referred to as ?realized savings?.  Slide 7 summarizes high level results ? while there was a relatively good alignment between the total projected and realized savings for the entire sample, individual projects were all over the map.

I agree with your last point below that the greatest source of error is too little measured data, but given the finite budget that each project has, I hoped that documents such as Guideline 14 would emphasize the link between the minimum scope of measurements and ECMs considered for a given project. For example Guidelines 14 says the following concerning simulation defaults, which in my opinion is impractical:

5.3.3.3.7 Minimizing Default Values. Check and thoroughly
understand all default input variables in the simulation
program, as many of the default values have little resemblance
to the actual building being simulated. The fewer the
number of default values used, the more representative the
simulation will be?but only if the changes are well reasoned.
This also includes inspection of the default performance
curves of the various systems and plant equipment, because
such curves can significantly impact the results of the simulation.
Any program default values that are altered, however,
should be well documented.

There is also a section on adjusting infiltration / ventilation rates to calibrate the model (quoted below), but it should only apply if project does not include ECMs involving air-sealing (which are common in multifamily and school projects) or ventilation controls such as DCV. If project includes infiltration or ventilation related measures, the related inputs cannot be used to calibrate the model even as ?a last resort?.

5.3.3.3.6 Estimating Infiltration Rates. Infiltration
rates are difficult to measure and may be treated as an
unknown that is iteratively solved with the simulation program
once the other major parameters are determined. This
approach is only recommended as a last resort. To solve for
the infiltration rate and/or the ventilation rate iteratively, conduct
a series of simulation runs such that only the infiltration
and/or ventilation rates are changed from one-tenth to as
much as ten times the expected rates. Next, compare the simulation
outputs produced to the measured building data as discussed
below. In addition, supporting evidence should be
used to justify the final choice of variables.

I think calibrated simulation should be treated as an extension of retrofit isolation approach, and site measurements performed in support of simulation must at minimum include (a) parameters that are modified to model ECM savings, and (b) simulation inputs that do not change but drive ECM savings. For lighting fixture replacement ECM, pre-retrofit wattage would be an example of (a), and lighting runtime hours would be an example of (b). On the other hand, if there are no ECMs that reduce base load (e.g. plug load, lighting, etc.), but there are ECMs involving HVAC controls, site measurements should focus on operation of existing controls, and establishing existing lighting wattage is not necessary because model calibrated to capture the overall base load (lighting + plug loads) usage may be good enough in this case. We had to develop guidelines for incentive programs that rely on calibrated simulation to specify minimum scope of measurements and acceptable ?estimated? inputs for each common ECM type. I hope that a similar guidance would be included at some point in one of ASHRAE standards / guidelines. As it stands now, there is a sea of difference between the specificity of simulation requirements in 90.1 Appendix G compared to calibrated simulation of existing buildings. Unless I am missing some key reference?

Excellent insights in this thread!
Our "two cents":

 *   We measure key variables such as larger motor kW and outdoor airflow.  The idea is to eliminate uncertainty for energy aspects that we know are "big".  Because it's easy to obtain, we use the actual weather data.  It's not always a big impact, but eliminates needless uncertainty.
 *   We don't trust people's memory about almost anything; it's amazing how different the story can be when told by two different people, both of whom should be knowledgeable.
 *   We also don't trust sensor calibration.  Not all sensors matter as much, however; discharge sensors on reheat systems, for example, matter more than room temp sensors.
 *   More data is better.  Smart meters are very helpful, as is trend data if the client has taken time to set them up. Not many do :(
 *   We have not yet tinkered with sensitivity analysis for uncertain variables such as boiler efficiency or infiltration, but we do run GenOpt for the best R-squared fit to each (exact) billing period and review / revise the output for reasonableness.
 *   On the one hand, it bothers me that calibrated models are "grossly incorrect" in Maria's experience.  My bias is that those models may have too little measured data.  On the other hand, this is a brave new world and we probably all have a lot to learn.

I'll second that this has turned into a really good thread. My personal rule of thumb in doing calibration is, "don't mess with things that relate directly to an ECM." If you have a retrofit ECM going on, you should have detailed data on the pre-installation conditions associated with that ECM. If that isn't documented, your model is never going to provide you with accurate savings results. It pays to think about these things at the fundamental level. And also apply a reasonableness range to those values. What am I most unsure about? What's the possible range of this value? Personally, I twist my dials all in one direction and then use setpoint as my fine calibration factor at the end. We need to remember that we're using models as tools to help guide decision-making. When we make decisions in calibration, we should think about how it will impact the decision being made -- does it impose a bias (like the 35% assumed pre-retrofit boiler efficiency for a boiler retrofit project)? These models are just tools for extrapolating from known energy consumption data to unknown energy consumption data.

An earlier post commented that hourly data might make calibration easier... It doesn't make it easier in the sense of less work, but it does make your model a lot better if you do it right. Calibrating models to real hourly consumption data tells you so much about what is likely wrong with your model and so much about how your real building performs. If you have hourly end use data, or close, then you are really in business. At the aggregate level, this kind of data can tell you that you didn't really know much to start with. For one project for Con Edison, we had access to hourly whole-premise consumption data for several thousand NYC buildings by building type. We were able to use this data to uncover that our models vastly underestimated consumption at nights and on weekends. We didn't know why, but we altered schedules accordingly.

As for the monthly billing data question at the beginnning of this thread, if you're dealing with a building and climate where monthly variability in occupancy and weather are driving changes in energy consumption in smooth, continuous fashion, you can make some other approximations. We've used a simplified slope method, where you calculate the slope in usage between the two adjacent billing months, i.e. if period 1 is 1000 kWh/day, period 2 is 1100 kWh/day, and period 3 is 1200 kWh/day, and all are 30 days long, you wind up with a slope of 3.33 kWh/day. We then assign daily kWh for each month using this slope and then reslice the data to match our calendar months. This is important when you are calibrating an aggregate model, which is a common need for us when we're estimating program-level savings for an ECM. For example, we're using a building simulation model to extrapolate measured consumption at a large sample of sites to usage in a typical year.

Alternatively, for individual buildings, we don't worry about it and just calibrate to the billing periods instead. We're not generally working in eQuest, but rather with the hourly output of whatever engine we're using.

One thing I've been wondering about recently is how to avoid over-calibration. The econometrics/statty/mathy folks I occasionally consort with talk a lot about overfitting of regressions and the same problem applies here. Has anybody ever tried reserving part of their calibration data set to use as a test set? I've gotten some things that looked like really great calibrations in the past, but I'm wondering how folks have sought to prove whether they were getting things right or overfitting. When I teach junior staff about this sort of thing, I always include something about not getting too cute. I point them to the John Von Neumann quote:
?         With four parameters I can fit an elephant<https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Elephant>, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk.

Jim and all,

We have incentive programs in NY (Multifamily Performance Program) and NJ (Pay for Performance Program for C&I buildings, P4P) that require developing calibrated models to estimate ECM savings. Both programs rely on spreadsheet-based tools to facilitate model calibration, and require that the proposed ECM package reduces overall energy consumption by at least 15%. The programs have been around for 5+ years, and have hundreds of participating projects. Part of the incentive is awarded based on the projected (i.e. modeled) savings, and the rest (as much as 50% for P4P) based on the actual achieved savings established using Whole Building approach by comparing pre/post utility bills.

My biggest take away from the involvement with these programs was that a calibrated model that meets MBE,  CVRMSE, and uncertainty requirements of Guideline 14 may produce grossly incorrect ECM savings. It is not feasible to create a calibrated model that can be reliably used to project savings from any conceivable ECM in a commercial non-research setting because, aside from the modeling effort, it would require a lot of very detailed field work. On the other hand, developing a calibrated simulation to estimate savings from a particular set of measures considered for a given project is a much more manageable task. So the bulk of the recent updates to the technical requirements of our incentive programs were focused on itemizing parameters that should be tweaked to achieve calibration depending on the ECMs included in the project scope. For example, if project involves boiler replacement, efficiency of existing boilers that are being replaced must be measured. (We had a project which modeled existing boiler as 35% efficient because that produced calibrated simulation. Of course such model would very likely exaggerate savings from installing a new boiler.)

Do any of you know references that outline calibration techniques depending on the ECMs being modeled, beyond the general advice included in IPM&VP?

Thanks,

Maria

I'm encouraged to see so many people addressing this topic because it means you are modeling existing buildings; a lot of work is needed in this arena.  Keep it up!

We, as usual, have a spreadsheet solution.  In this case, the spreadsheet is happy to use billing periods of any length, such as is normal for day-of-reading variations, but also to combine "estimated" readings into a period that has an actual reading at each end.
It requires that you tell EnergyPlus to report hourly meter data for each fuel (e.g., electricity and natural gas).  A macro totals that data into the billing periods for your site, displays the predicted vs actual energy and calculates an R-squared value for each fuel and the total. An example is shown below.

Hello all,

We usually do the following to calibrate model to monthly utility bills:

1)      Create or purchase weather file corresponding to pre-retrofit period for which we have billing data. Lately we?ve been using WeatherAnalytics files, which we found to be more cost effective than creating our own (they charge $40 for an annual file).

2)      Run simulation using this weather file instead of TMY.

3)      Standard simulation reports (we typically use eQUEST) show usage by calendar month (e.g. January, February, etc.) which is usually not aligned with dates of utility bills, as noted in the question that started this thread. As Brian mentioned in one of the earlier posts, this may be circumvented by entering the actual meter read dates into eQUEST as shown in the screenshot below. This will align usages shown in eQUEST?s ?E*? reports such as ES-E with the actual utility bills.  The approach does not allow entering more than one read date per month (e.g. we can?t capture April 3 ? 28 bill). For projects where this limitation is an issue we generate hourly reports that show consumption by end use for each meter in the project, and aggregate it into periods that are aligned with utility bills.

<image002.png>



4)      We then copy simulation outputs (either from ES-E or hourly reports, depending on the method used) into a standard spreadsheet with utility data. The spreadsheet is set up to plot side by side monthly utility bills and simulated usage, and also calculates normalized mean bias error (NMBE) and variance CV(RMSE).

5)      If we did not to where we want to be with NMBE and CV(RMSE) we adjust and re-run the model, and re-paste results into the same spreadsheet.

In my experience regression analysis using weather as independent variable (i.e. running model with TMY file and normalizing for difference in weather) or relying on HDD to allocate usage to billing periods can be very misleading, mainly because on many projects weather is not the main driver of consumption. For example energy usage of a school during a given time period depends much more on vacation schedule than outdoor dry bulb temperatures.

Hello Joe,



Yes, you can count the degree days and regress against that to show a correlation. However, one will get a better "fit" to the weather data if you regress to the degree day that is calculated for the balance point temperature of the building -- hence the inverse model toolkit or the variable based degree day method.



PRISM actually calculates the degree days to a variety of change points and actually provides a table for each location that you use as a look up. The IMT will actually perform a variable based degree day calculation that agrees well with PRISM. IMT will also provide you with the average daily temperature for the billing period.



When using DOE-2 for actual billing periods, one will have to extract the appropriate hourly variable, sum it to daily and then regroup to align with the billing periods. Here's a chunk of code that will create a dummy plant, display PV-A, PS-A, PS-E and BEPS, and extract the relevant hourly variables to normalize the BEPS to the utility bills:

Maybe I'm missing something here, but why can't you just count up the degree days for the utility period?
I hope you're not working with average or "typical year" degree days, but the degree days from the same time period.

I also recall that the old Princeton Scorekeeping Method (PRISM) back in the 1980's allows the user to enter the degree days for that time period, so it's not a new problem.

When calibrating an energy model to utility bills the utility bills often don?t align with the month start and end.  I have reviewed a couple methods to calendar normalize the utility bills but find them somewhat unsatisfactory.

For example the method I am looking at does the following:
The April gas bill runs from March 25 ? April 24.  The algorithm takes the average number of m3 per day from that bill, applies it to the days in April.  Then it takes the average number of days from the May bill which runs from April 24 ? May 25 and applies that average to the remaining days in April.

The issue is that the March-April period has much higher HDD than the April-May period and the ?normalized? gas usage is significantly lower than the simulation data for April.

I am wondering if there are any papers or other sources of information as to how others approach this problem.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modelling shared central plant
Message-ID: <2022723094.1600680.1435657215253.JavaMail.yahoo@mail.yahoo.com>

Dear All,
The query is regarding modeling district cooling. Our project is a New construction building which is designed to share the chiller with another adjacent building. Based on the "District cooling document", if option-2 is chosen, then we will have to model the proposed case with a virtual central plant with average efficiency. How to calculate the average efficiency?Also how to basically model central plant (head, efficiency, flow of pumps, cooling tower etc.) in these kind of cases?

Crowdsourcing Initiative Seeks Buildings-Related Problems to Solve

Calling all building technology innovators! The Building Technologies Office is partnering with the successful SunShot Catalyst crowdsourcing initiative to identify and solve problems related to software development, data, and/or automation.

In the first, ?Ideation? phase of the initiative, those working in the building technology space are invited to submit problem statements describing challenges that need to be overcome in order to promote better engagement with building occupants and to improve the ability to balance energy and occupant comfort objectives in a building. In addition to submitting problem statements, participants are invited to vote and comment on ideas that have already been submitted.

Browse buildings-related statements that have been submitted<http://links.govdelivery.com:80/track?type=click&enid=ZWFzPTEmbWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTUwNjMwLjQ2NjE2NjMxJm1lc3NhZ2VpZD1NREItUFJELUJVTC0yMDE1MDYzMC40NjYxNjYzMSZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEwMDEmc2VyaWFsPTE3MzcyOTk3JmVtYWlsaWQ9YW1pci5yb3RoQGVlLmRvZS5nb3YmdXNlcmlkPWFtaXIucm90aEBlZS5kb2UuZ292JmZsPSZleHRyYT1NdWx0aXZhcmlhdGVJZD0mJiY=&&&103&&&http://catalyst.energy.gov/a/ideas/tag/tags/Buildings>.

Individuals who submit a problem statement will have a chance to win a $1,000 cash prize!
Problem statements need to be submitted by July 15, 2015.
