Dear all,

I am using eQUEST for a LEED project in Spain. I used System 5  
Packaged VAV for the baseline model and my savings are almost 95%  
compared to the proposed model, which doesn't seem to be justified. I  
tested System 6 in a previous model and the savings were considerably  
lower (and more reasonable). Have you had any similar experience with  
System 5 and very high energy savings for heating?

Thank you very much in advance.

*Presentation #1: Feasibility of Passive House for Public Buildings*



As New York City pursues greater carbon reductions, the Passive House
standard (PH) offers a way to significantly accelerate energy savings in
public buildings.  While PH is common throughout Europe, very few buildings
in NYC have achieved the standard, and those that have are private homes.
This rigorous standard sets a high benchmark for energy reduction that far
exceeds the current New York City Energy Conservation Code and LEED?s
Energy and Atmosphere prerequisite.  PH principles focus on high
performance envelopes, and simple but controlled mechanical ventilation
with heat recovery, so it can be applied to a range of building types and
construction systems.  However, with few completed examples, determining
the standard?s applicability to public projects in NYC is difficult.



The New York City Department of Design and Construction (DDC) and Atelier
Ten recently completed a study of three DDC projects that examines the
changes in design, construction, and building operation necessary to meet
the PH standard.  Each project brings to light different opportunities and
challenges when considering PH.  The study involved modeling potential
energy efficiency measures related to the building envelope, lighting, and
mechanical systems, as well as the potential impact of incorporating all
measures on source energy intensity and CO2 emissions.  Although not
exhaustive, the study does provide great insight into how PH can be
employed in public projects, possible environmental benefits and
limitations.

analysis group.  She received a Bachelor of Architecture from Kamla Raheja
Vidhyanidhi Institute for Architecture & Environmental Studies in India,
and a Master of Science in Building Design from Arizona State University.



*Presentation #2: Calibrated Building Energy Model Set for City-Scale
Energy Analysis*



With deeper penetration of intermittent renewable energy resources, supply
and demand effects at a higher time resolution will become more important
as variations in grid emissions will become more significant. Effects of
building stock changes on usage profiles are not easily analyzed, and
on-site fossil fuel usage ? the dominant loads in many urban areas ? are
generally only available annually. Columbia University developed a set of
23 building models representative of the NYC building stock, based on the
Department of Energy?s reference building models and calibrated to hourly
NYC electricity demand data and building type electricity and fuel EUIs
based on a statistical analysis of zip code-level building and energy usage
data. This talk will focus on the methodology used, the results, and
potential research and policy applications.



*Presenter:*



Michael Waite, P.E., is PhD candidate in Mechanical Engineering at Columbia
University where he is a National Science Foundation IGERT Fellow. Mike
researches integrating renewable energy into existing grids and
infrastructure and analyzing buildings as nodes in energy networks. His
particular focus is improving renewable energy utilization through urban

Sounds liked you're referring to Precipitable Water, which has no relationship to the actual liquid precipitation falling on the ground. PW is reported in the TMY2/3 weather files, mainly because it's used along with a few other arcane variables (aerosol optical depth, albedo) in modeling solar radiation. These are all echoed in the EPW, which content-wise is 99% identical to the TMY2/3s, but I can't think of any reason why any of these variables would be used in EnergyPlus.

Another reason I'm doubtful of your explanation is that PW is typically reported in depth (0.1 cm in the TMYs) and not pressure.

Not sure what this section of the EnergyPlus stat file is reporting (will get this fixed or clarified)

 - Monthly Indicators for Precipitation/Moisture (kPa)
                    Jan    Feb    Mar    Apr    May    Jun    Jul    Aug    Sep    Oct    Nov    Dec

But if you keep searching for "precipitation" you'll find what I think you're looking for

 - Monthly Statistics for Liquid Precipitation mm
                    Jan    Feb    Mar    Apr    May    Jun    Jul    Aug    Sep    Oct    Nov    Dec

That said, I would echo Joe's comments about using this information with caution.  Some data sources do not contain actual precip amounts but only a flag for raining or not raining.  The weather processor will fill in approximate precip amounts in that case.

Mayank,

You're right.  kPa is a unit of pressure, so somehow the header units you're using have been misaligned.  I won't comment on what you see in the EPW, but if you look at the source weather file, which probably uses a TMY3 or TMY2/IWEC format (the only ones I know that contain precipitation data), there are two columns for liquid precipitation, one for depth in mm followed by one for duration in hr.

Having said that, from my investigations in creating the IWEC2 weather files I've concluded that this way of reporting the liquid precipitation can lead to missing or double counting the amount of precipitation. The reason is that in the actual weather station reports, there may be multiple reports in one record, e.g.,
   100mm over the past 1 hour and 500mm over the past 24 hours
as well as reports that overlap in time, e.g.,
   200mm over the past 4 hours
followed several hours later by
   400mm over the past 24 hours

I've attached the brief-up about liquid precipitation from the IWEC2 final report with more details.

The other thing to consider is that if you're using a "typical year" weather file, the liquid precipitation on that file are a random selection and may not represent long-range averages.  Depending on your level of interest, it's best to go back to the source historical weather files such as those available at NCDC:  www.ncdc.noaa/oa/climate/isd/<http://www.ncdc.noaa/oa/climate/isd/>

Dear All,
I am doing some analysis on weather file in which I need precipitation value in mm or  inches. However, when I look on stat extension file, there is monthly precipitation value in kPa. As I know 'kPa' is a unit of pressure. Please let me know if anyone has  conversion factor for monthly precipitation value from kPa to mm(inches).
The epw extension file has hourly precipitation value in mm. However, all the weather files do not have hourly precipitation values.
I'll be grateful if anyone can guide me on this. :)

Regards,
Mayank

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modelling of roof top solar photovoltaic plant in eQUEST
Message-ID: <CAL-7vycYbYsvTimk177U7GBJnZ4c3JUadqYFmXX0P+pRhtP=uw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Sir/Madam,

 I have modelled 157.5 kWp roof top SPV plant in eQUEST with three electric
generators of 52.5 kWp and three inverters of 93% efficiency. Each electric
generator of 52.5 kWp is having 210 modules (1 module=250 Wp ) connected in
series and parallel combination, i.e. 15 in series and 14 in parallel.

After simulation, In .SIM file, I found that the ratio of inverter
output(AC kWh) to inverter input (DC kWh) lies between 60%-75% despite of
93% inverter efficiency.

1) Would you please answer why 25%-40% loss is shown through inverter?
2) Is there any option for battery in eQUEST for SPV plant modelling?

Kindly help me for my queries

Thanking you in anticipation

With kind regards

Ashok Dhayal

Message-ID: <d30b24e30a7e498a8158bc9cf3593376@AM3PR02MB0391.eurprd02.prod.outlook.com>

Hi,

I am having difficulty formulating a response to USGBC about the difference between the Design Coil Load (Btu/hr) and the Nominal Total Capacity (Btu/hr). They are questioning why the difference between the two isn't 15% as required by ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G. I have over sized all zones by the 1.15 at the zone level like EnergyPlus allows however on this report the difference between the Design Coil Load (Btu/hr) and the Nominal Total Capacity (Btu/hr) is 20%. I found online that the design coil load is indeed the sensible load capacity so this could be the reason that there is a greater percentage than 15% between the two. However, there is not much information on this. I would like to know a bit more about how each of these parameters are calculated in the software. I cannot find much online about it.

Does anyone have some insight on the difference between the Design Coil Load (Btu/hr) and the Nominal Total Capacity (Btu/hr) reported in the Cooling Coils table on the Equipment Summary report? Or direct me to a reference where I can find such information?

Thank you in advance for your help.

Celia,
Nominal Capacity includes the AHRI standard fan power, which is not appropriate for your comparison.  Use the "Rated" capacity.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] EnergyPlus Cooling Coils Question

Jim's comment is valid for the Standard Rated Net Cooling Capacity which 
is reported for DX coils.  I'm guessing you are referring to a chilled 
water coil.

EnergyPlus sizing factors are applied at the zone level, so the Design 
Coil Load already includes the extra 15%.  The difference is that the 
design coil load is based on the actual coil entering and leaving 
conditions at the coil peak load during the sizing calculations, but the 
nominal total capacity is reported at a standard set of inlet/outlet 
conditions (to provide a way to compare coil sizes on the same basis).  
In the Input Output Reference, the description of the Equipment Summary 
output report explains:

Cooling Coils includes the nominal total, sensible and latent 
capacities, the nominal
sensible heat ratio, the nominal efficiency, nominal UA value, and 
nominal surface
area for each cooling coil. These values are calculated by calling the 
cooling coil
simulation routine with the rated inlet conditions: inlet air dry bulb 
temperature =
26.67C, inlet air wet bulb temperature = 19.44C, inlet chilled water 
temperature =
6.67C.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] TRACE 700 - Room multipliers and PTACs
Message-ID: <868214535E16E743AFAB887CD3644DBBDCC274@server.elm.local>

I'm working on a multi-use building with 3 stories of apartments on top
of a story of retail. I'm using a split DX heat pump for each apartment,
which I'm simulating in TRACE as PTAC units. I know I can use zone
multipliers to group together identical units across multiple floors.
 
If I use room multipliers instead of simulating each and every apartment
and heat pump, how do I reflect this in the energy model? If I were to
create a system for each individual PTAC, I would set the coil
capacities to whatever the unit can put out. But I'm confused how TRACE
factors in zone multipliers with unit capacities.
 
For instance, let's say I have 4 identical apartment. Each has a heat
pump that puts out 12 Mbh cooling and 9 Mbh heating. In the "Create
Systems - Heating and Cooling Coil Overrides" menu, would I put the coil
capacities at 12 Mbh and 9 Mbh, with TRACE automatically creating four
identically-sized coils? Or would I have to multiply it out myself and
put the capacities at 48 Mbh and 36 Mbh, with TRACE splitting the total
capacity between the four apartments? Or would I have to do it another
way altogether?
 
Thank you!

Hi everyone,

 

Some in the community have picked up on this (and some of you are directly
responsible), but for everyone else I wanted to give an informal heads up:
my email and physical location have changed up over the past few weeks!
Many colleagues in the onebuilding community contact me directly /
'off-list,' and I could not set an auto-reply or forwarding email address at
my previous inbox, so let this serve as my change-of-address notice for
those of you keeping me in your contacts lists!  Updated info is below in my
new email signature.

 

I've moved a few time zones over from KC to join the 360 Analytics team in
Seattle, WA.  It was hard to say goodbye to my friends and professional
associates in the Midwest, but I am very much looking forward to meeting and
associating faces to some of the familiar names in this area!  

 

Regards,

 

~Nick

Smart, Sustainable and Healthy Cities
 
First
International Conference of 
The
CIB Middle East and North Africa Research Network 
(CIB-MENA
2014)
 
Hosted
by:
Abu
Dhabi University, UAE
14-16 December
2014

Theme
 
Cities in the
Middle East and North Africa, like cities in other parts of the world, are
experiencing an unprecedented wave of urbanization.  This urbanization is
forecast to continue and intensify in the next decades.  Many old cities
are mushrooming to incomprehensible sizes and are forecast to approach or
exceed 40 million people in the coming decade.  In other cases instant
cities have emerged and developed from wilderness to full urban status within a
single generation.
 
This rapid
development poses a great challenge for all those involved in the design,
planning, construction, and management of the built environment in order to
provide sustainable, livable, equitable, and viable cities for all people. 
These challenges are so diverse and range from retrofitting existing building
stock and infrastructure to the design and construction of new developments.
They are also so diverse that they requires innovative interventions at
different levels starting from urban and infra-structure planning on one end of
the scale to interior design and material science on the other end of the scale
with many other levels in-between including architecture, civil engineering,
urban design, and landscape architecture.  The challenges are also so
diverse that sustaining cities will not be possible without interdisciplinary
efforts. Decision makers will need to involve multidisciplinary teams of
planners, architects, engineers, environmentalists, scientists and economists to
sustain the growth of these centers that are shaped by global factors, and
aspire to retain local identities.  This
conference will provide an excellent opportunity for everyone involved in the
design, planning, construction, and management of the built environment to
share  international best practices,
experiences, technologies, and policies applicable, and offering solutions to
the challenges of cities in the 21st century.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Accelerad - lighting simulation on the GPU
Message-ID: <CAJR73ts3mCRxxFkvp-eYRnB8Ayia+CLNFp8CY9KqkvgRFfHtRw@mail.gmail.com>

I'm pleased to announce the beta release of Accelerad,
a free GPU-accelerated suite of programs for lighting and daylighting
analysis and visualization.

Accelerad uses physically-based backward ray tracing algorithms inspired by
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory?s popular Radiance software suite by
Greg Ward. These algorithms are accelerated up to twenty times faster using
a ray tracing engine built for the graphics processor unit (GPU). The
acceleration factor scales with the number of available GPUs and is
expected to increase on new generations of hardware. In order to allow for
smooth adoption among Radiance users and software developers, Accelerad
maintains compatibility with Radiance scene and output file formats and
currently uses a subset of Radiance?s material modifiers and command-line
arguments.

For more information and to receive a copy of the beta release, visit

Hi 

 

We just released the first version of ExCalibBEM, a free tool to assist simulation experts in the calibration of EnergyPlus or DOE2.2 models. The software facilitates the implementation of parametric and optimization runs in order to achieve a better match between simulation results and measured data, especially on short time intervals (15 minutes). ExCalibBEM can be described as a complete interface to GenOpt, a generic optimization program developed by LBNL laboratory, with several interesting functionalities including the generation of an objective function for calibration purposes, the automatic creation of input template file with the required indicators and the visualization of simulated and measured data. 

 

Here is a short video presentation : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biab4V2hmWM&feature=youtu.be

 

For more info and download : https://www.simeb.ca/ExCalibBEM/index_en.php

 

It is fully documented, with examples and a case study. Bilingual interface (English/ French).

BLDG-SIM community,

I hosted a tutorial "Python Scripting for Energy Modellers" at the
IBPSA/ASHRAE conference in Atlanta last week -- similar to the one Marcus
Jones and I did last year at the BS2013 Conference in France.

We're releasing the tutorial materials for free download and use -- they're
based on the IPython notebook format:

Dear Dr Vishal and Dr Jyotirmay ji,
Good Day,

It was indeed pleasure to meet and exchange ideas with you. It is nice to know that BS15 is being organised in India.  May I suggest on low cost buildings, hutments, slum structure  dedicating portion of the huge knowledge base addressing to large and intense need with low purchasing power. I draw upon the writings of Prof. CK Prahlad and Dr Meshalker and that had been basically Gandhian Engineering and Indian Ethos. Please convey my appreciation and regards to Shri Tathagat and Dr Shivraj. I would like to put forward and  propose Dr Shivraj?s study on higher comfort temperature to the UAE regulatory body to adjust the AC temperatures.

I would be looking forward to see you whenever you are visiting or passing through UAE. Please feel free to let me know if I could be of any assistance.


With Best Wishes and kind regards,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Two Questions for the esteemed members of this fine list
Message-ID: <541DD48D.80703@wichert.org>

I am working on modeling a small computer room.  The computers are the 
major load.  The space is served by a small water cooled chiller and an 
air handler, with economizer.  The questions are:

1)  Does EnergyPlus lend itself to such models, and are there specific 
tools that might be useful?  I am interested in accurately modeling the 
computer with varying loads over the year, and with the economizer 
enabled to show the difference in various supply air temperatures and 
cooling tower strategies (multiple versus one cooling tower, variable 
versus multiple fans) as well as various economizer strategies (return 
air versus supply air control and the resulting chiller loading).  I am 
also interested in detailed chiller modeling, as the load varies from 
full economizer to full chiller and the chiller part-load performance is 
a key attribute. The chiller supply temperature will be higher than 
typical for chilled water coil cooling, so that must be flexible as well.

2)    Is there any specialized modeling tool that anyone knows about 
that is especially good for such modeling?  I would instinctively say 
EQuest is NOT good for that, but I may be mistaken.  I could make 
EnergyPro work, but I do not believe that the cooling tower / chiller 
interface is detailed enough using DOE.2.

Your thoughts are appreciated.


Cheers!

Robert,

1.       EnergyPlus can do this with one proverbial hand tied behind its back.  (You, however, will need both hands)

2.       I am unaware of a specialized tool.

Unless I'm missing something here, this seems like a very 
straightforward modeling problem.  I'm curious why you think that eQUEST 
or DOE-2 can't handle it.  There are plenty of chiller performance 
curves, and you could also create your own if you have data on the 
chiller characteristics.

I am working on modeling a small computer room.  The computers are the 
major load.  The space is served by a small water cooled chiller and an 
air handler, with economizer.  The questions are:

1)  Does EnergyPlus lend itself to such models, and are there specific 
tools that might be useful?  I am interested in accurately modeling the 
computer with varying loads over the year, and with the economizer 
enabled to show the difference in various supply air temperatures and 
cooling tower strategies (multiple versus one cooling tower, variable 
versus multiple fans) as well as various economizer strategies (return 
air versus supply air control and the resulting chiller loading).  I am 
also interested in detailed chiller modeling, as the load varies from 
full economizer to full chiller and the chiller part-load performance is 
a key attribute. The chiller supply temperature will be higher than 
typical for chilled water coil cooling, so that must be flexible as well.

2)    Is there any specialized modeling tool that anyone knows about 
that is especially good for such modeling?  I would instinctively say 
EQuest is NOT good for that, but I may be mistaken.  I could make 
EnergyPro work, but I do not believe that the cooling tower / chiller 
interface is detailed enough using DOE.2.

Your thoughts are appreciated.


Cheers!

This is a question for those familiar with EE4 modeling.  Has anyone submitted EE4 models to the USGBC for LEED v4?  Is there a risk that the reviewers might have difficulty accepting EE4 models. I would have to separately create an EE4 model for the 90.1-2010 baseline case.

Thanks to all who have replied.  This has been very helpful, as always.  
I was not aware of the eQUEST option of using DOE-2.3 with data center 
additions.  This sounds quite well suited to my situation.

Jeff, are you an experienced user of this version with data center 
additions?  Can you recommend someone who is?

I have posted this, as recommended, to unmethours.com and I will 
consider posting it to the eQUEST list as well.


Thanks to all!

Hi Chris,

1. In general,the  USGBC does not approve or certify software for LEED
energy modelling. Instead, the  requirement for LEED Submission is that the
software must meet the specification of the relevant ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G
Performance Rating Method. Refer to G2.2 for all the details.

2. EE4 is based on DOE 2.1E which I believe it has been tested in
accordance with ASHRAE Standard 140. Similar software include EnergyPro
(actually they are from the same developer).

3. Refer to ADVANCED ENERGY  MODELING FOR LEED
http://www.gbci.org/files/leedonline/Advanced_Energy_Modeling_for_LEED_V2_1c.pdf
Appendix
B where they listed commonly used simulation software. As I mentioned
Energypro which use the same engine as EE4 is listed.

Personally I do not see a problem by using EE4 provided you model 90.1
baseline separately. But I have no experience of submitting a EE4 model to
the USGBC for LEED. The best bet is to seek answer from USGBC directly.

Before you jump into DOE2.3, make sure you read DOE23Vol6-NewFeatures.  The first section lists the DOE2.2 features not currently included in DOE2.3.  For example OA-FROM-SYSTEM is not implemented.

There are data center addition to the wizard but at least on bug incorrectly set the CW loop design temp to zero, so you have to fix that. We are trying to get all the lumps out of this version of eQUEST and DOE-2.3 to make it an official release, but you might find it interesting to try.

From the DOE-2.3 help file on this topic (look in help under doe23 for the chm):

Introduction

Data centers typically have equipment loads varying between 20 W/sq.ft. to over 150 W/sq.ft. Because these equipment loads dwarf the loads found in typical commercial facilities such as office buildings, data centers offer unique opportunities for achieving energy savings in the HVAC systems. Many existing technologies are already applicable to data center HVAC systems, such as economizers, and others are currently in research and development.

To facilitate the analysis of data centers, several new features have been incorporated into the program, including:

?      Hot aisle / cold aisle simulation - conventional HVAC air distribution results in spaces in which the temperature is relatively uniform from floor to ceiling, and from side to side. In contrast, the equipment racks in data centers may be configured in rows, with the air intakes oriented to one row and the air exhaust to another row; creating cold aisles and hot aisles. Further, if all supply air is distributed to the cold aisles, and physical barriers constructed to reduce air circulation between the hot aisles and the cold aisles, then significant stratification may be achieved between the supply temperature introduced into the cold aisles, the average cold aisle temperature, and the return air temperature. This stratification can make economizers more effective, and can also enhance the performance of chilled-water coils or DX systems.

?      Equipment sizing based on supply/return temperature differentials - For sizing airflows into a zone, the airflow is typically calculated based on the zone load, and the differential between the MIN-SUPPLY-T and the DESIGN-COOL-T. An alternative has been added to allow the differential to be directly specified.

?      Multiple HVAC systems serving the same zone - Data centers typically have more than one HVAC unit serving the same space. The program has been enhanced to allow multiple identical HVAC systems to serve the same zone. Units may be either all run in parallel, or may be staged on/off according to the load.

?      Thermostat location - The ability to specify whether the zone thermostat is located in the zone (measuring average cold aisle temperature), or in the return air.

?      A new cooling tower control strategy - Because data centers typically operate with a cooling load 24 hours per day, and new control scheme has been implemented to allow the cooling tower temperature setpoint to be reset based on wetbulb temperature.

?      Waterside economizer - This version of the program supports a waterside economzer fully integrated into the chilled water loop. The waterside economizer is upstream of the chillers, and precools the return water prior to entry into the chillers. This feature is presented in a separate section in this document, "CHW-Loop Economizer Cooling".

?      Underfloor air distribution supply plenums served by single-zone systems - Data centers often have the supply air delivered via an underfloor supply plenum. Previously, the program could simulate underfloor supply plenums for single duct systems such as variable-air volume systems with multiple zones. This capability has been extended to single zone systems such as SZRH and PVVT; systems which are typically used in data centers. Underfloor air distribution is discussed in a separate section, "Underfloor HVAC Air Distribution".

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Open Positions for Post Doctoral Research Associate
Message-ID: <542205C8.7050303@cam.ac.uk>

2 positions are open for Research Assistant/Associate in the Department 
of Engineering at University of Cambridge (UK) to work on Energy 
Management of Non-Domestic Buildings.

The key responsibilities and duties are to: investigate and develop new 
approaches of uncertainty analysis for energy management of buildings, 
research and test relevant methods; demonstrate their success by 
identifying, compiling, analysing data from existing buildings and from 
industry experts; writing high quality journal articles and reports; 
independence in the management of research including coordination with 
academic and industry collaborators.

Successful candidates will work with a team of researchers from 
Engineering, Architecture, and the Judge Business School. This is a 
multi-disciplinary project, involving the use of existing building data, 
statistical analysis (uncertainty quantification in particular), and 
energy simulation models to understand and improve energy management of 
non-domestic buildings. The research team is led by Ruchi Choudhary 
(Engineering) and includes Sebastian Macmillan (IDBE), Koen Steemers & 
Yeonsook Heo (Architecture), and Michael Pollitt (Judge Business School).

Applications are invited from candidates who have obtained or are close 
to obtaining a PhD in Engineering, Computer Science, Statistics, or 
relevant discipline. It is necessary that the candidates have high 
quality of skills in quantitative analysis and in computation, as well 
as very good communication and writing skills. Candidates must 
demonstrate research experience relevant to at least two of the 
following topics: uncertainty analysis, computation (eg. High 
performance computing), energy simulation of buildings. Relevant 
industry experience on energy management of buildings will be beneficial 
to the project.

Dear All,

I am doing envelope analysis of a rectangular building in eQuest. The
building have identical parameters for all perimeter zones. The simulation
is being done for New Delhi climate zone. The results shows that the total
solar heat gain through glazing is more in east zone compare to west zone.
In the result of that the total load and energy consumption in east zone is
higher than in west zone.

To verify the results, I analyzed the total horizontal and beam radiation
incident on east and west facade. Here, the issue was started. In the
eQuest, there always high incident solar radiation in east surface compare
to west surface. However, the incident solar radiation on east and west
surface in energy plus and TRNSYS have different trend from the eQuest.
Here I am attaching graph showing variation of incident solar radiation in
east and west facade with energy plus and TRNSYS.

Any guidance, suggestions will be appreciated.

1. Variation in eQuest and TRNSYS. (Blue and green is for eQuest and;
Magenta and brown for TRNSYS)

Mayank,
compare them with direct normal, diffused, global radiations, trend in E+
and equest are reverse, one has more on east other has more on west,
important would be to see what does the radiation data say?

Are you using the same hourly weather data in eQuest, TRNSYS and
EnergyPlus?  The radiation can vary significantly.

Dear Dru,

Yes, I am using the same weather file for all simulation tools. eQuest used
bin format, which I have already checked with weather file (epw format).
The bin file only have total horizontal radiation and Normal direct
radiation, the diffuse radiation is being calculated by eQuest itself (as
per Joe huang's mail: previously asked for a query on eQuest users). TRNSYS
and E+ used epw format.

The variation are found in radiation falling on east and west surface of
the building.

Regards,
Mayank

Dear Jeff,

I converted same epw file into bin format using eQ_WthProc (DOE weather
converter tool). Additionally, eQuest also have hourly output for global
data (total horizontal radiation, direct normal radiation) which are also
compared and found identical with the epw weather file.

Regards,
Mayank

Hi All,
Please share your answers to/views on the following queries.
1. How significant is the impact of location - different continents/countries - of a building on its energy demand? You may assume these are similar to each other on all aspects except for their location. Please share any examples, if possible, e.g. Sweden versus Texas.
2. Could you cite examples of cities where the natural weather, for maximum possible days, is comfortable for humans. So, cities where least possible heating and cooling is required.
Regards,
Jeetendra.India.

Jeetendra,

For item 2, I suggest that you review a table of heating and cooling degree days. These tables are published in the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals and include cities from all over the world. The cities with the lowest of each will form the answer to your question.

For item 1, I recommend that you revise your question as it is not possible to build the same building in every climate. Different countries/cities have building codes that would restrict you from doing so. But if you want to have some fun, you could take the prototypical building models and simulate them for the different cities you are interested in. http://www.energycodes.gov/commercial-prototype-building-models

You also didn't say that you're using the EPW weather file in EQUEST, only that EQUEST is using .BIN format (or binary). Is EQUEST using TMY2 or TMY3?

In addition to Shanta's comments, consider that "comfort" is not the same around the world.  I spoke with a colleague not long ago who indicated that 30C was acceptable for many buildings in Pune, India.  That is not true for most of North America!  Other countries will probably also have differing comfort expectations.

Message-ID: <048a01cfd818$0d369790$27a3c6b0$@jeplus.org>

Dear Group,

 

A new version of jEPlus (v1.5 beta) is available to download from
SourceForge <https://sourceforge.net/projects/jeplus/> . There are a few
important changes and additions in this version, namely:

 

- @calc() syntax in parameter definition allows parameter values to be
calculated from a formula. For example, P3's values can be defined as
@calc(P2/2+10).

- All new RVX file for customizing result collection, which allows

                + Use multiple RVI files and SQL commands

+ Use Python scripts for extracting and processing simulation results 

+ Compute user-defined variables and metrics to put in combined result
tables

- New in-built text editor with syntax highlighting that works well with
various file formats and sizes

 

For more details, please check out the user's manual:
http://www.jeplus.org/wiki/doku.php?id=docs:manual_1_5. We are currently
working on examples to demonstrate the full potential of these new features.
jEPlus+EA and the JESS service will also be updated in due course to
incorporate these changes. Please do let us have your feedbacks or
questions, either using these mailing lists or on the jeplus forum
<http://jeplus.org/mybb/> .

If you do not already know about this- there is a weather related comfort
tool called climate consultant that you may want to look into. It uses EPW
files and shows general passive design strategies effectiveness.

 Dear Colleagues,

Would you tell me, please, which simulation program can simulate performance of green roofs.I would be gratefulif you 
could kindly guide me by offering any information . I am planning to simulate performance of one the building in terms of 
energy and acoustic through green roof.

Thanks in advance for any help and advice

I would recommend referring following research papers on comfort benchmark
worldwide. These are available on Elsevier:

*Comfort assessment in the context of sustainable buildings: Comparison of
simplified and detailed human thermal sensation methods*

*Thermal comfort conditions in sustainable buildings e Results of a
worldwide **survey of users? perceptions*

Hi All,
Thank you for the responses.
Brian: your reply shows a comparison which I was looking for, although the data you shared seems different from what's available from EIA and Eurostat.
Jim: Thanks for pointing out the "comfort expectations" aspect. This adds a dimension that seems difficult to analyze - gap analysis for different locations. Please share if you can suggest any source for comfort benchmarks.
Shanta: for conciseness, I'd skipped what you pointed out, but sure this has to be accounted for. Thanks for pointing this out. Also, for suggesting the ASHRAE tables and the link.
Jeremiah: didn't know about the link. Thanks. Shall try checking that soon. 

Well, I would like to ask you the following question(the reason for my earlier questions):
Do you think our understanding of the impact of location on energy and emissions, esp due to natural factors, can be used for planning where should we build cities in future, to fight global warming?
For now, just a no/yes is fine.
Looking forward to your views.
Sincerely,
Jeetendra.

If you do not already know about this- there is a weather related comfort tool called climate consultant that you may want to look into.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] General query - impact of location on energy demand Jeetendra, For item 2, I suggest that you review a table of heating and cooling degree days. These tables are published in the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals and include cities from all over the world. The cities with the lowest of each will form the answer to your question. For item 1, I recommend that you revise your question as it is not possible to build the same building in every climate. Different countries/cities have building codes that would restrict you from doing so.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] 90.1-2010 Baseline lighting power allowance calculation
Message-ID: <25F861E695EA99478F9790869A57C7D4DDD90D@catormsx02>

I am somewhat confused about calculating the baseline lighting power calculation, Space-By-Space method, with respect to lighting controls.

For example, Table G3.1 states "Lighting shall be modeled having the automatic and manual controls in Section 9.4.  For a Conference/Meeting/Multipurpose room the LPD is 1.23 W/ft2.  9.4.1.2.(b) states that a conference room shall have an occupancy sensor.  Does this mean that the LPD is reduced by the factor listed in Table G3.2 is 10% for occupancy sensor in buildings greater than 5000 ft2.  So would the LPD for the baseline conference room be 1.23 * 0.9 = 1.1?

Thanks for your assistance!

EnergyPlus has a model for green roofs.

I'm not sure it handles acoustics, but it will simulate energy and water.

?Wait a minute, guys. I suddenly recall that Table G3.2 has been removed
from Appendix G by its addendum cg. In the same addendum, Table
3.1/6.lighting has also been modified. I just quote the relevant part for
your consideration:

Proposed design

"e. The lighting schedules in the proposed building design shall reflect
the mandatory automatic lighting control requirements in Section 9.4.1
(e.g., programmable controls or occupancy sensors).
Exception: Automatic daylighting controls required by Section 9.4.1 shall
be modeled directly in the proposed building design or through
schedule adjustments
determined by a separate daylighting analysis approved by the rating
authority.
f. Automatic lighting controls included in the proposed building design but not
required by Section 9.4.1 may be modeled directly in the building simulation
or be modeled in the building simulation through schedule adjustments
determined by a separate analysis approved by the authority having
jurisdiction. As an alternative to modeling such lighting controls, the
proposed building design lighting power density may be reduced by the sum
of all additional allowances per Section 9.6.2c and Table 9.6.2, which are
calculated individually as the lighting power under control multiplied by
cf, where cf is the appropriate control factor given in Table 9.6.2
corresponding
to the space type and the lighting controls designed to be used."

Baseline

"c. Mandatory automatic lighting controls required by Section 9.4.1 shall
be modeled the same as the proposed building design."

It looks like section 9.6.2c and Table 9.6.2 will govern the calculation
rather than Table G3.2.

Jeetendra,
My opinion regarding your question: No (Impact of location on energy is not specially relevant.)

I wonder about your assumptions: I?ve seen sources which say that the globe has not warmed in over a decade.  This is different than many climate models? predictions and suggests that we don?t understand very well the impact of humans on the globe?s climate. One of my ardent wishes is that the climate discussion would become more scientific and less political.  At the moment, it seems hard to filter data from polemic.
I think it is very important to use resources wisely for a variety of reasons other than ?climate change?, but principal among them is to promote human flourishing.  Energy is a GOOD thing and even has a strong correlation to health and prosperity; limiting it?s availability, as has been part of recent discussion in the US, for many parts of the world might mean that they remain without refrigeration or reasonable heating and cooling  ? not so good for those people?s health and well-being.  Wasteful use or polluting are a different matter than thoughtful use.  I haven?t thought this through in great detail, but it seems that wise use of energy in one country makes more available for others at lower cost.  I like that thought.

Hi All,

Thank you for the responses.

Brian: your reply shows a comparison which I was looking for, although the data you shared seems different from what's available from EIA and Eurostat.

Jim: Thanks for pointing out the "comfort expectations" aspect. This adds a dimension that seems difficult to analyze - gap analysis for different locations. Please share if you can suggest any source for comfort benchmarks.

Shanta: for conciseness, I'd skipped what you pointed out, but sure this has to be accounted for. Thanks for pointing this out. Also, for suggesting the ASHRAE tables and the link.

Jeremiah: didn't know about the link. Thanks. Shall try checking that soon.
Well, I would like to ask you the following question(the reason for my earlier questions):

Do you think our understanding of the impact of location on energy and emissions, esp due to natural factors, can be used for planning where should we build cities in future, to fight global warming?

For now, just a no/yes is fine.

Looking forward to your views.

Sincerely,

Jeetendra.

Jeetendra,



For item 2, I suggest that you review a table of heating and cooling degree days. These tables are published in the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals and include cities from all over the world. The cities with the lowest of each will form the answer to your question.



For item 1, I recommend that you revise your question as it is not possible to build the same building in every climate. Different countries/cities have building codes that would restrict you from doing so. But if you want to have some fun, you could take the prototypical building models and simulate them for the different cities you are interested in. http://www.energycodes.gov/commercial-prototype-building-models

Hi Chris and Nick,

Did some research and below is my observation:

1. Instead of modifying the baseline, you will have to keep the same
schedule (with consideration of mandatory lighting control requirement) in
both proposed design and baseline.

2. Meanwhile, LPD from Table 9.6.1 which is 1.23W/ft2 in your case, should
remain the same in the baseline.

3. For the spaces where no mandatory lighting control requirement, you can
claim credit in the proposed design  by using:

installed lighting power under control -  installed lighting power under
control x control factor (table 9.6.2)

4. Without doing 3, you can also modify lighting schedule in the proposed
design to claim non-mandatory control savings but you have to provide
separate analysis

Do you guys agree with my interpretation? Let me know your thoughts.

There are multiple ways to approach proposed vs. baseline LPD?s & scheduling which would arrive at the same annualized answer for relative lighting end-use energies, however Table G3.1 has another line that helps clarify 90.1?s intent.  (I?m paraphrasing) ?The lighting schedules (which are normally identical between baseline and proposed) are understood to reflect the mandatory automatic control requirements.?  The suggestion here is to use the baseline LPD?s presented, unmodified, for the baseline model.  In turn, the proposed model may take the prescribed ?credit? for occupancy sensors anywhere they are used EXCEPT for the spaces identified within the mandatory requirements (section 9.4).  As an example, if you had a proposed LPD of 0.90 installed in an office with occupancy sensors everywhere, you could model 0.81 for all spaces excepting the conference/break rooms, where you?d model the actual LPD.  

 

Incidentally, if you are performing an Appendix G model for LEED, I believe this is the approach pushed by the EAp2 workbook/footnotes.

 

Be cognizant that the inverse procedure you?ve proposed (amplifying the baseline LPD, instead of reducing the proposed LPD) may have the same net difference for lighting consumptions, but may result in a different (possibly helpful / possibly detrimental) overall Appendix G performance rating percentage, as you are now playing with distribution of the baseline?s internal loads instead of the proposed model?s.

I am somewhat confused about calculating the baseline lighting power calculation, Space-By-Space method, with respect to lighting controls.

 

For example, Table G3.1 states ?Lighting shall be modeled having the automatic and manual controls in Section 9.4.  For a Conference/Meeting/Multipurpose room the LPD is 1.23 W/ft2.  9.4.1.2.(b) states that a conference room shall have an occupancy sensor.  Does this mean that the LPD is reduced by the factor listed in Table G3.2 is 10% for occupancy sensor in buildings greater than 5000 ft2.  So would the LPD for the baseline conference room be 1.23 * 0.9 = 1.1?

Hi Shahryar 
EnergyPlus can model thermal performance of green roofs via Material:roofVegetation object developed by Portland University, see i/o ref for more info.
Unfortunately I can't give you any suggestion about acoustic performance simulation program.

Hi All,

Thank you for the responses.

Brian: your reply shows a comparison which I was looking for, although the data you shared seems different from what's available from EIA and Eurostat.

Jim: Thanks for pointing out the "comfort expectations" aspect. This adds a dimension that seems difficult to analyze - gap analysis for different locations. Please share if you can suggest any source for comfort benchmarks.

Shanta: for conciseness, I'd skipped what you pointed out, but sure this has to be accounted for. Thanks for pointing this out. Also, for suggesting the ASHRAE tables and the link.

Jeremiah: didn't know about the link. Thanks. Shall try checking that soon. 


Well, I would like to ask you the following question(the reason for my earlier questions):

Do you think our understanding of the impact of location on energy and emissions, esp due to natural factors, can be used for planning where should we build cities in future, to fight global warming?

For now, just a no/yes is fine.

Looking forward to your views.

Sincerely,

Jeetendra.

If you do not already know about this- there is a weather related comfort tool called climate consultant that you may want to look into.

I am somewhat confused about calculating the baseline lighting power calculation, Space-By-Space method, with respect to lighting controls.
 
For example, Table G3.1 states ?Lighting shall be modeled having the automatic and manual controls in Section 9.4.  For a Conference/Meeting/Multipurpose room the LPD is 1.23 W/ft2.  9.4.1.2.(b) states that a conference room shall have an occupancy sensor.  Does this mean that the LPD is reduced by the factor listed in Table G3.2 is 10% for occupancy sensor in buildings greater than 5000 ft2.  So would the LPD for the baseline conference room be 1.23 * 0.9 = 1.1?
 
Thanks for your assistance!

Jeetendra,
My opinion regarding your question: No (Impact of location on energy is not specially relevant.)
 
I wonder about your assumptions: I?ve seen sources which say that the globe has not warmed in over a decade.  This is different than many climate models? predictions and suggests that we don?t understand very well the impact of humans on the globe?s climate. One of my ardent wishes is that the climate discussion would become more scientific and less political.  At the moment, it seems hard to filter data from polemic. 
I think it is very important to use resources wisely for a variety of reasons other than ?climate change?, but principal among them is to promote human flourishing.  Energy is a GOOD thing and even has a strong correlation to health and prosperity; limiting it?s availability, as has been part of recent discussion in the US, for many parts of the world might mean that they remain without refrigeration or reasonable heating and cooling  ? not so good for those people?s health and well-being.  Wasteful use or polluting are a different matter than thoughtful use.  I haven?t thought this through in great detail, but it seems that wise use of energy in one country makes more available for others at lower cost.  I like that thought.

	?
But do all of these programs account fro the impact on the roof micro
climate? None to my knowledge do. When you get a large roof surface
the above roof air temperature bias can be 2-5DegC between a cool roof
(or green roof) and more historical roof (higher absoprtance). These
second order effects become essential to account for if you have
mechanical equipmnt on the roof as ventilation air and condesning
temperatures are impacted. We have been doing some research into this
area in Australia.?Think about the urban heat island effect at a
micro scale, becomes very important with big box retail, shopping
centres, industrial facilities, airports, maybe hospitals etc. for
shopping centres in Australia with AHUs on the roof, E+, DOE-2.2 and
IES only account for 20-25% of the cool roof benefits via th first
order effects. The second order effects due to the micro climate bias
are 3-4 times what is accounetd for within these programs ... 

	We haven't been able to get software developers to bring attention to
this so if others can shake the tree it would be good as the
workarounds while?possible are quite involved with a high degree of
uncertainty. There is a paper I wrote for IBPSA BS 2011 I can forward
when I get back from leave in a few weeks for those interested.

But do all of these programs account fro the impact on the roof micro climate? None to my knowledge do. When you get a large roof surface the above roof air temperature bias can be 2-5DegC between a cool roof (or green roof) and more historical roof (higher absoprtance). These second order effects become essential to account for if you have mechanical equipmnt on the roof as ventilation air and condesning temperatures are impacted. We have been doing some research into this area in Australia. Think about the urban heat island effect at a micro scale, becomes very important with big box retail, shopping centres, industrial facilities, airports, maybe hospitals etc. for shopping centres in Australia with AHUs on the roof, E+, DOE-2.2 and IES only account for 20-25% of the cool roof benefits via th first order effects. The second order effects due to the micro climate bias are 3-4 times what is accounetd for within these programs ...

We haven't been able to get software developers to bring attention to this so if others can shake the tree it would be good as the workarounds while possible are quite involved with a high degree of uncertainty. There is a paper I wrote for IBPSA BS 2011 I can forward when I get back from leave in a few weeks for those interested.

EnergyPlus has a model for green roofs


I?m not sure it handles acoustics, but it will simulate energy and water.

Hi All,
Javed: Thank you for sharing the publication titles. Shall check soon.
Jim: I assume you are following the developments closely - http://c40.org/blog_posts/global-mayors-compact-shows-unity-and-ambition-to-tackle-climate-change. But I agree, we should be scientific in our approach. I often think of an argument - Can we handle the consequences if we are wrong about ignoring global warming? But, even if I go by the perspective of energy only, the question remains valid (PS). If emissions was the reason for your "No", please let me know your answer now. Besides, do send your comments on what Brian shared earlier as it shows that location does have an impact, if I am not missing something there.
Sincerely,
Jeetendra.
PS: Can our understanding of the impact of location on energy, esp due to natural factors, be used for planning where should we build cities in future, to conserve energy?

Jeetendra,My opinion regarding your question: No (Impact of location on energy is not specially relevant.) I wonder about your assumptions: I?ve seen sources which say that the globe has not warmed in over a decade.  This is different than many climate models? predictions and suggests that we don?t understand very well the impact of humans on the globe?s climate. One of my ardent wishes is that the climate discussion would become more scientific and less political.  At the moment, it seems hard to filter data from polemic. I think it is very important to use resources wisely for a variety of reasons other than ?climate change?, but principal among them is to promote human flourishing.  Energy is a GOOD thing and even has a strong correlation to health and prosperity; limiting it?s availability, as has been part of recent discussion in the US, for many parts of the world might mean that they remain without refrigeration or reasonable heating and cooling  ? not so good for those people?s health and well-being.  Wasteful use or polluting are a different matter than thoughtful use.  I haven?t thought this through in great detail, but it seems that wise use of energy in one country makes more available for others at lower cost.  I like that thought.

Jeetendra,
 
For item 2, I suggest that you review a table of heating and cooling degree days. These tables are published in the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals and include cities from all over the world. The cities with the lowest of each will form the answer to your question.
 
For item 1, I recommend that you revise your question as it is not possible to build the same building in every climate. Different countries/cities have building codes that would restrict you from doing so. But if you want to have some fun, you could take the prototypical building models and simulate them for the different cities you are interested in. http://www.energycodes.gov/commercial-prototype-building-models

Hi All,
 
Please share your answers to/views on the following queries.
 
1. How significant is the impact of location - different continents/countries - of a building on its energy demand? You may assume these are similar to each other on all aspects except for their location. Please share any examples, if possible, e.g. Sweden versus Texas.
 
2. Could you cite examples of cities where the natural weather, for maximum possible days, is comfortable for humans. So, cities where least possible heating and cooling is required.
 
Regards,
 
Jeetendra.
India.

I'm not directly on topic here, but I think the interesting question from a
planning perspective is more like this:
Where can human settlement be done most inexpensively in a
carbon-constrained world? I.e. When you combine the variety of
weather/climate drivers on energy consumption with the availability of
carbon-free energy supplies, where are the least expensive places to
develop?

For example, if you looked at Labrador and Newfoundland, you'd say they
look relatively energy intensive (brutally cold, long winters), but they
have cheap hydropower, so building there might make some sense. Hot dry
desert cities (like Phoenix) have high cooling energy intensities, but
their solar resource is excellent. I think this partially gets at part of
Jim's argument -- it's not the energy that's the issue, it's the negative
externalities (carbon emissions included) that are the issue. You might get
a misleading result if you don't include the carbon-free energy
availability dimension in your analysis.

If you combine a map you could generate from a passive energy screening
tool with a map of carbon-free energy availability you could come up with
something fairly compelling.

Dear Joe,

Thanks for your response and interest in this issue. I have done some more
analysis and would appreciate your inputs.

I am using the same weather file for both energy plus and eQuest. As eQuest
uses BIN format I converted the same epw format file using eQ_wthProc tool
(EPW to BIN converter). I have attached a spreadsheet (New
Delhi_ISHRAE_2014EPW.xlsx)  that compares Total global Horizontal radiation
and direct normal radiation for EPW file (by converting it into CSV format)
and eQuest hourly outputs (as it reads BIN file). Since both the global
horizontal and direct normal radiations are identical, conversion from epw
to bin seems correct. Additionally, as you know, eQuest doesn't take
diffused radiation from the weather file, it calculates itself.

Since I am using the same source file for both eQuest and Eplus simulations
I would expect similar trend in solar radiation data for both East and West
facades. However, for Delhi I found variation in solar radiation output for
east and west facade. I have attached results spreadsheet (eQUest and
energy plus_Miami and Delhi_v1.xlsx) for your reference.

Interestingly, when I performed a similar analysis for "Miami epw and bin
file", I got fairly consistent results (refer graph below, the results are
for June 6 to June 9)

[image: Inline image 1]  [image: Inline image 2]
[image: Inline image 3]
[image: Inline image 5]

I would like to understand the inconsistency in results for the Delhi case
in particular.

Regards,
Mayank

Dear Jeetendra,

 

You may be interested in this paper: http://www.bso14.org/BSO14_Papers/BSO14_Paper_071.pdf, where wide range of building forms are compared in all 17 ASHRAE 90.1 climate zones. Figure 5 in the paper may be a direct answer to your question 1 (and possibly 2), where you can see (office) buildings consumes on average 1/4 -1/3 of energy in temperate climates compared to the same buildings in the subarctic (zone 8) and the very hot (zone 1) climates. 

 

Please note that this study was not designed for assessing the impact of climate, and it has only considered office buildings of the modern construction type. There are many complex factors in play; so you should not take those numbers literally. However, the importance of climate is well known in this community, and it should not be difficult to find literature on this subject. Come to think of it, looking up ?zero carbon buildings? and where they?ve been realized, may help you find answers to question 2.

 

Cheers,

 

Yi Zhang

Hi All,

 

Javed: Thank you for sharing the publication titles. Shall check soon.

 

Jim: I assume you are following the developments closely - http://c40.org/blog_posts/global-mayors-compact-shows-unity-and-ambition-to-tackle-climate-change. But I agree, we should be scientific in our approach. I often think of an argument - Can we handle the consequences if we are wrong about ignoring global warming? But, even if I go by the perspective of energy only, the question remains valid (PS). If emissions was the reason for your "No", please let me know your answer now. Besides, do send your comments on what Brian shared earlier as it shows that location does have an impact, if I am not missing something there.

 

Sincerely,

 

Jeetendra.

 

PS: Can our understanding of the impact of location on energy, esp due to natural factors, be used for planning where should we build cities in future, to conserve energy?

Jeetendra,

My opinion regarding your question: No (Impact of location on energy is not specially relevant.)

 

I wonder about your assumptions: I?ve seen sources which say that the globe has not warmed in over a decade.  This is different than many climate models? predictions and suggests that we don?t understand very well the impact of humans on the globe?s climate. One of my ardent wishes is that the climate discussion would become more scientific and less political.  At the moment, it seems hard to filter data from polemic. 

I think it is very important to use resources wisely for a variety of reasons other than ?climate change?, but principal among them is to promote human flourishing.  Energy is a GOOD thing and even has a strong correlation to health and prosperity; limiting it?s availability, as has been part of recent discussion in the US, for many parts of the world might mean that they remain without refrigeration or reasonable heating and cooling  ? not so good for those people?s health and well-being.  Wasteful use or polluting are a different matter than thoughtful use.  I haven?t thought this through in great detail, but it seems that wise use of energy in one country makes more available for others at lower cost.  I like that thought.

I would recommend referring following research papers on comfort benchmark worldwide. These are available on Elsevier:

 

Comfort assessment in the context of sustainable buildings: Comparison of simplified and detailed human thermal sensation methods

 

Thermal comfort conditions in sustainable buildings e Results of a worldwide survey of users? perceptions

Hi All,

 

Thank you for the responses.

 

Brian: your reply shows a comparison which I was looking for, although the data you shared seems different from what's available from EIA and Eurostat.

 

Jim: Thanks for pointing out the "comfort expectations" aspect. This adds a dimension that seems difficult to analyze - gap analysis for different locations. Please share if you can suggest any source for comfort benchmarks.

 

Shanta: for conciseness, I'd skipped what you pointed out, but sure this has to be accounted for. Thanks for pointing this out. Also, for suggesting the ASHRAE tables and the link.

 

Jeremiah: didn't know about the link. Thanks. Shall try checking that soon. 

Well, I would like to ask you the following question(the reason for my earlier questions):

 

Do you think our understanding of the impact of location on energy and emissions, esp due to natural factors, can be used for planning where should we build cities in future, to fight global warming?

 

For now, just a no/yes is fine.

 

Looking forward to your views.

If you do not already know about this- there is a weather related comfort tool called climate consultant that you may want to look into. It uses EPW files and shows general passive design strategies effectiveness.  http://www.energy-design-tools.aud.ucla.edu/climate-consultant/request-climate-consultant.php

Jeetendra,
 
For item 2, I suggest that you review a table of heating and cooling degree days. These tables are published in the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals and include cities from all over the world. The cities with the lowest of each will form the answer to your question.
 
For item 1, I recommend that you revise your question as it is not possible to build the same building in every climate. Different countries/cities have building codes that would restrict you from doing so. But if you want to have some fun, you could take the prototypical building models and simulate them for the different cities you are interested in. http://www.energycodes.gov/commercial-prototype-building-models

Hi All,

 

Please share your answers to/views on the following queries.

 

1. How significant is the impact of location - different continents/countries - of a building on its energy demand? You may assume these are similar to each other on all aspects except for their location. Please share any examples, if possible, e.g. Sweden versus Texas.

 

2. Could you cite examples of cities where the natural weather, for maximum possible days, is comfortable for humans. So, cities where least possible heating and cooling is required.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] CHIBPSA Social/Networking Event on Tuesday September 30th
Message-ID: <26b7d968dba84a1bb7acac19ea62c69c@BLUPR04MB771.namprd04.prod.outlook.com>

The Chicago Chapter of IBPSA-USA (CHIBPSA) is getting together for drinks and discussion.

Here are the details:

*         Rockit Bar & Grill, 22 W. Hubbard in Chicago

*         Tuesday 9/30/14 evening from 5:30-7:30pm

*         We'll be in the 2nd floor lounge (NOT by the front windows...that area is reserved for another group)

Rockit is conveniently close to the BUILDINGChicago / Greening The Heartland conference, so if you're attending or speaking at there on Tuesday, come on over for a drink with us.

In addition to chatting about Greening The Heartland, several CHIBPSA members attended the recent ASHRAE/IBPSA Building Energy Modeling conference in Atlanta, and can share their experiences.

Best regards,
Matt Huffman, LEED AP

I'm not directly on topic here, but I think the interesting question from a planning perspective is more like this:
Where can human settlement be done most inexpensively in a carbon-constrained world? I.e. When you combine the variety of weather/climate drivers on energy consumption with the availability of carbon-free energy supplies, where are the least expensive places to develop?

For example, if you looked at Labrador and Newfoundland, you'd say they look relatively energy intensive (brutally cold, long winters), but they have cheap hydropower, so building there might make some sense. Hot dry desert cities (like Phoenix) have high cooling energy intensities, but their solar resource is excellent. I think this partially gets at part of Jim's argument -- it's not the energy that's the issue, it's the negative externalities (carbon emissions included) that are the issue. You might get a misleading result if you don't include the carbon-free energy availability dimension in your analysis.

If you combine a map you could generate from a passive energy screening tool with a map of carbon-free energy availability you could come up with something fairly compelling.

Hi All,

Javed: Thank you for sharing the publication titles. Shall check soon.

Jim: I assume you are following the developments closely - http://c40.org/blog_posts/global-mayors-compact-shows-unity-and-ambition-to-tackle-climate-change. But I agree, we should be scientific in our approach. I often think of an argument - Can we handle the consequences if we are wrong about ignoring global warming? But, even if I go by the perspective of energy only, the question remains valid (PS). If emissions was the reason for your "No", please let me know your answer now. Besides, do send your comments on what Brian shared earlier as it shows that location does have an impact, if I am not missing something there.

Sincerely,

Jeetendra.

PS: Can our understanding of the impact of location on energy, esp due to natural factors, be used for planning where should we build cities in future, to conserve energy?

Jeetendra,

My opinion regarding your question: No (Impact of location on energy is not specially relevant.)



I wonder about your assumptions: I?ve seen sources which say that the globe has not warmed in over a decade.  This is different than many climate models? predictions and suggests that we don?t understand very well the impact of humans on the globe?s climate. One of my ardent wishes is that the climate discussion would become more scientific and less political.  At the moment, it seems hard to filter data from polemic.

I think it is very important to use resources wisely for a variety of reasons other than ?climate change?, but principal among them is to promote human flourishing.  Energy is a GOOD thing and even has a strong correlation to health and prosperity; limiting it?s availability, as has been part of recent discussion in the US, for many parts of the world might mean that they remain without refrigeration or reasonable heating and cooling  ? not so good for those people?s health and well-being.  Wasteful use or polluting are a different matter than thoughtful use.  I haven?t thought this through in great detail, but it seems that wise use of energy in one country makes more available for others at lower cost.  I like that thought.

Hi All,



Thank you for the responses.



Brian: your reply shows a comparison which I was looking for, although the data you shared seems different from what's available from EIA and Eurostat.



Jim: Thanks for pointing out the "comfort expectations" aspect. This adds a dimension that seems difficult to analyze - gap analysis for different locations. Please share if you can suggest any source for comfort benchmarks.



Shanta: for conciseness, I'd skipped what you pointed out, but sure this has to be accounted for. Thanks for pointing this out. Also, for suggesting the ASHRAE tables and the link.



Jeremiah: didn't know about the link. Thanks. Shall try checking that soon.

Well, I would like to ask you the following question(the reason for my earlier questions):



Do you think our understanding of the impact of location on energy and emissions, esp due to natural factors, can be used for planning where should we build cities in future, to fight global warming?



For now, just a no/yes is fine.



Looking forward to your views.

If you do not already know about this- there is a weather related comfort tool called climate consultant that you may want to look into. It uses EPW files and shows general passive design strategies effectiveness.  http://www.energy-design-tools.aud.ucla.edu/climate-consultant/request-climate-consultant.php

Jeetendra,

For item 2, I suggest that you review a table of heating and cooling degree days. These tables are published in the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals and include cities from all over the world. The cities with the lowest of each will form the answer to your question.

For item 1, I recommend that you revise your question as it is not possible to build the same building in every climate. Different countries/cities have building codes that would restrict you from doing so. But if you want to have some fun, you could take the prototypical building models and simulate them for the different cities you are interested in. http://www.energycodes.gov/commercial-prototype-building-models

Hi All,

Please share your answers to/views on the following queries.

1. How significant is the impact of location - different continents/countries - of a building on its energy demand? You may assume these are similar to each other on all aspects except for their location. Please share any examples, if possible, e.g. Sweden versus Texas.

2. Could you cite examples of cities where the natural weather, for maximum possible days, is comfortable for humans. So, cities where least possible heating and cooling is required.

Regards,

Jeetendra.
India.

Yes. (Consider energy use as a function of climate for city planning purposes.) Joel, Justin and Yi make good points below. I have never built a city before, but Planetary Overlord Bishop would also consider climate change impacts on agriculture, freshwater resources, extreme weather events, and (as Justin mentioned) availability of renewable resources (solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, ocean etc.). Then there?s things like access to transportation, walkability, ?sense of place?. Hopefully one of my minions would speak up before I did something like this<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryugyong_Hotel>.

Yes, climate change is happening, it is not natural, and we are causing it primarily by burning our once-in-a-civilization supply of fossil fuels as fast as we possibly can. The fundamentals of the greenhouse effect have been known since the 19th century, and temperatures have been rising just as we?d expect them to based on our emissions and other impacts. Following a sharp temperature spike to the hottest year on record in 1998 (caused by the strongest El Nino event ever recorded), global temperatures have remained high and have even continued to increase. We just had the highest May, June and August average temperatures<http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/2014/8>, and 2014 is on track to set another record high for global temperature (breaking the 2010 record). It has been nearly 30 years since we had a month that was below the 20th century average temperature for that month.

There is nothing political about the science. But our ideological biases get in the way when we consider solutions. We have to reduce fossil fuel use (not energy in general) and the only way to accomplish that is by government legislation. There are those that oppose the size and scope of governments, especially interference with the free market, and also those that sincerely believe that humans cannot possibly impact the planet (for religious reasons mostly). And plenty of people make their livelihoods and a lot of money off of fossil fuels<http://theenergycollective.com/jared-anderson/451466/not-my-balance-sheet-climate-change-fossil-fuels-and-stranded-assets>. So these biases understandably make it hard to find common ground with those whose biases include wanting to accelerate the transition to renewables, wanting to address wealth disparity, and general opposition to fossil fuels due to their other harmful impacts. Because of the implications of ?What do we do??, the science gets muddied by a combination of deliberate distortions and willful ignorance, happily perpetuated by ?think tanks?, news organizations and powerful individuals that attempt to spin the science to match their preferred narrative. Add countless blogs by non-scientists, a 24-hr news cycle that only pays lip-service to climate change, always maintaining false balance by presenting ?the other side?, and editorials that masquerade as science presented without accountability, and it is no surprise that we find ourselves in a quagmire of analysis paralysis.

Only when we recognize our own biases and acknowledge the reality of climate change as documented by the wealth of scientific evidence, does it make sense to discuss solutions. How do we rapidly reduce fossil fuel use, promote energy efficiency and renewables, decrease the energy use intensities of manufacturing, agriculture, transportation and (yes) the building stock, while reducing the impact of rising prices? And how do we do this in a way that gets all countries to follow suit, while minimizing the role of governments, respecting personal choice and freedoms, and letting market forces determine the most economically efficient paths toward a low-carbon future? The simple, elegant solution is a revenue-neutral carbon tax in the form of Carbon-Fee-&-Dividend<http://citizensclimatelobby.org/carbon-tax/>. You tax fossil fuels at the source, and distribute all collected fees to everyone equally, to spend as they please. We can avoid the worst effects of climate change without destroying the economy<http://climatecolab.org/web/guest/plans/-/plans/contestId/1300404/planId/2802>.

Guess I embellished my one-word answer a little bit.

Hi All,
Javed: Thank you for sharing the publication titles. Shall check soon.
Jim: I assume you are following the developments closely - http://c40.org/blog_posts/global-mayors-compact-shows-unity-and-ambition-to-tackle-climate-change. But I agree, we should be scientific in our approach. I often think of an argument - Can we handle the consequences if we are wrong about ignoring global warming? But, even if I go by the perspective of energy only, the question remains valid (PS). If emissions was the reason for your "No", please let me know your answer now. Besides, do send your comments on what Brian shared earlier as it shows that location does have an impact, if I am not missing something there.
Sincerely,
Jeetendra.
PS: Can our understanding of the impact of location on energy, esp due to natural factors, be used for planning where should we build cities in future, to conserve energy?

Jeetendra,

My opinion regarding your question: No (Impact of location on energy is not specially relevant.)

I wonder about your assumptions: I?ve seen sources which say that the globe has not warmed in over a decade.  This is different than many climate models? predictions and suggests that we don?t understand very well the impact of humans on the globe?s climate. One of my ardent wishes is that the climate discussion would become more scientific and less political.  At the moment, it seems hard to filter data from polemic.

I think it is very important to use resources wisely for a variety of reasons other than ?climate change?, but principal among them is to promote human flourishing.  Energy is a GOOD thing and even has a strong correlation to health and prosperity; limiting it?s availability, as has been part of recent discussion in the US, for many parts of the world might mean that they remain without refrigeration or reasonable heating and cooling  ? not so good for those people?s health and well-being.  Wasteful use or polluting are a different matter than thoughtful use.  I haven?t thought this through in great detail, but it seems that wise use of energy in one country makes more available for others at lower cost.  I like that thought.

Hi All,
Dr. Zhang: Thank you for sharing the publication and for the search suggestion. Both seem useful. Shall try checking details soon. Besides, since I do not want to assume your ans please reply to my question(Ref: my email on 25th, ...planning ...cities in future), if possible.
Justin: you are spot-on about "carbon-free energy". That's why my original question(in the ref above) had "impact of location on energy and emissions". The possibility of using renewables - low/zero emissions - at specific locations would make them more attractive. Besides, of course, the economic aspect you mentioned is also important.
Joel: Your reply seems to be very much on-topic, if I am not missing something(!). Your point on existing places being more important is logical. That could be one of the reasons why it seems counter intuitive to you, or it hasn't been seen. But, the intent is not to compare only virgin land with existing cities. The idea is to analyze the attractiveness of different locations from the standpoint of energy and emissions (based on published data - existing cities - to start with). As I foresee, to search for any suitable, as yet, uninhabited places also, we would need to understand the characteristics of existing (attractive) cities first. Besides, of course, for building a city at a new location we would need to understand its linkage/transactions with the outside world. Possibly, some forum members with deep expertise in urban planning could offer some insights.
Thanks to everyone for the responses.
Looking forward to further points and perspectives!
Sincerely,
Jeetendra.

Dear Jeetendra, You may be interested in this paper: http://www.bso14.org/BSO14_Papers/BSO14_Paper_071.pdf, where wide range of building forms are compared in all 17 ASHRAE 90.1 climate zones. Figure 5 in the paper may be a direct answer to your question 1 (and possibly 2), where you can see (office) buildings consumes on average 1/4 -1/3 of energy in temperate climates compared to the same buildings in the subarctic (zone 8) and the very hot (zone 1) climates.  Please note that this study was not designed for assessing the impact of climate, and it has only considered office buildings of the modern construction type. There are many complex factors in play; so you should not take those numbers literally. However, the importance of climate is well known in this community, and it should not be difficult to find literature on this subject. Come to think of it, looking up ?zero carbon buildings? and where they?ve been realized, may help you find answers to question 2. Cheers, Yi ZhangEnergy Simulation Solutions Ltd.

Jeetendra,
 
For item 2, I suggest that you review a table of heating and cooling degree days. These tables are published in the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals and include cities from all over the world. The cities with the lowest of each will form the answer to your question.
 
For item 1, I recommend that you revise your question as it is not possible to build the same building in every climate. Different countries/cities have building codes that would restrict you from doing so. But if you want to have some fun, you could take the prototypical building models and simulate them for the different cities you are interested in. http://www.energycodes.gov/commercial-prototype-building-models

How significant is the impact of location - different continents/countries - of a building on its energy demand? You may assume these are similar to each other on all aspects except for their location. Please share any examples, if possible, e.g. Sweden versus Texas. 2. Could you cite examples of cities where the natural weather, for maximum possible days, is comfortable for humans. So, cities where least possible heating and cooling is required.

Mr. Bishop has been thinking about this for a while!  That is the attitude we need for problem solving! (indifference never solves anything)

We?re slightly off-topic for Jeetendra, as Joel points out.  Continuing, though,  I think I?ll take a different tack on the discussion and ask that you consider an example of human flourishing?s impact on another issue of a few decades ago.
Remember when it was a ?certainty? that the globe could not sustain a population exceeding around 6 billion because we would never be able to provide enough food for them?  At the time this was stated, it was true.  The (naively) unaccounted-for resource was human creativity and ingenuity in food-growing processes.  We now can grow enough for the world in a small portion of the world!  The next problem is how to distribute it to those who need it, and that appears to be more an issue of willingness than technology.
In my own life, I know that when challenged by someone saying ?It can?t be done? or ?It can?t be done economically?, my response has been to try and prove them wrong ? and I have succeeded on a number of occasions! ? and I am just one among many other talented and motivated people.
For the issue of climate change, I?m much more inclined to assume that motivated and creative people can develop novel ways to thrive than that solutions will come as a result of a government-initiated program led by people with different and perhaps less-strong motivations.  Bill has it right, in my opinion, when saying ?And how do we do this ?, while minimizing the role of governments, respecting personal choice and freedoms, and letting market forces determine the most economically efficient paths toward a low-carbon future??  It?s complex, but we can do it.  A journey of a thousand miles begins with?

p.s., I was unfamiliar with the Carbon Fee & Dividend initiative until Bill provided the link, but at first glance it appears to encourage and incentivize GREATER fuel use ? the more we use, the more we receive from the fund?. On second thought, individuals may get back only pennies for each energy dollar spent, so it may not be a strong incentive.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] General query - impact of location on energy demand - climate science

Yes. (Consider energy use as a function of climate for city planning purposes.) Joel, Justin and Yi make good points below. I have never built a city before, but Planetary Overlord Bishop would also consider climate change impacts on agriculture, freshwater resources, extreme weather events, and (as Justin mentioned) availability of renewable resources (solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, ocean etc.). Then there?s things like access to transportation, walkability, ?sense of place?. Hopefully one of my minions would speak up before I did something like this<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryugyong_Hotel>.

Yes, climate change is happening, it is not natural, and we are causing it primarily by burning our once-in-a-civilization supply of fossil fuels as fast as we possibly can. The fundamentals of the greenhouse effect have been known since the 19th century, and temperatures have been rising just as we?d expect them to based on our emissions and other impacts. Following a sharp temperature spike to the hottest year on record in 1998 (caused by the strongest El Nino event ever recorded), global temperatures have remained high and have even continued to increase. We just had the highest May, June and August average temperatures<http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/2014/8>, and 2014 is on track to set another record high for global temperature (breaking the 2010 record). It has been nearly 30 years since we had a month that was below the 20th century average temperature for that month.

There is nothing political about the science. But our ideological biases get in the way when we consider solutions. We have to reduce fossil fuel use (not energy in general) and the only way to accomplish that is by government legislation. There are those that oppose the size and scope of governments, especially interference with the free market, and also those that sincerely believe that humans cannot possibly impact the planet (for religious reasons mostly). And plenty of people make their livelihoods and a lot of money off of fossil fuels<http://theenergycollective.com/jared-anderson/451466/not-my-balance-sheet-climate-change-fossil-fuels-and-stranded-assets>. So these biases understandably make it hard to find common ground with those whose biases include wanting to accelerate the transition to renewables, wanting to address wealth disparity, and general opposition to fossil fuels due to their other harmful impacts. Because of the implications of ?What do we do??, the science gets muddied by a combination of deliberate distortions and willful ignorance, happily perpetuated by ?think tanks?, news organizations and powerful individuals that attempt to spin the science to match their preferred narrative. Add countless blogs by non-scientists, a 24-hr news cycle that only pays lip-service to climate change, always maintaining false balance by presenting ?the other side?, and editorials that masquerade as science presented without accountability, and it is no surprise that we find ourselves in a quagmire of analysis paralysis.

Only when we recognize our own biases and acknowledge the reality of climate change as documented by the wealth of scientific evidence, does it make sense to discuss solutions. How do we rapidly reduce fossil fuel use, promote energy efficiency and renewables, decrease the energy use intensities of manufacturing, agriculture, transportation and (yes) the building stock, while reducing the impact of rising prices? And how do we do this in a way that gets all countries to follow suit, while minimizing the role of governments, respecting personal choice and freedoms, and letting market forces determine the most economically efficient paths toward a low-carbon future? The simple, elegant solution is a revenue-neutral carbon tax in the form of Carbon-Fee-&-Dividend<http://citizensclimatelobby.org/carbon-tax/>. You tax fossil fuels at the source, and distribute all collected fees to everyone equally, to spend as they please. We can avoid the worst effects of climate change without destroying the economy<http://climatecolab.org/web/guest/plans/-/plans/contestId/1300404/planId/2802>.

Guess I embellished my one-word answer a little bit.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] General query - impact of location on energy demand

Further off topic, but shouldn?t the question of energy use in city planning/human settlement in the future be focused on increased density or adaptive reuse in established, accessible locations rather than the further build out of virgin land regardless of how well-suited it might be for current ?sustainable? measures? It?s fairly well-supported that we do not have the same amount of traditional fuel sources available for use (or misuse, depending on your views). Why aren?t we asking ourselves how well-suited any given place on the planet is for meeting the current and projected energy needs using available technology at a given capital cost? To me, it?s counterintuitive to construct new cities in order to fight global warming. I?ve yet to see a large scale commercial/residential development, no matter how sustainable the technology and planning, actually be carbon neutral when embodied energy is considered. The analogy of buying something you don?t need at a 50% discount comes to mind.

I'm not directly on topic here, but I think the interesting question from a planning perspective is more like this:
Where can human settlement be done most inexpensively in a carbon-constrained world? I.e. When you combine the variety of weather/climate drivers on energy consumption with the availability of carbon-free energy supplies, where are the least expensive places to develop?

For example, if you looked at Labrador and Newfoundland, you'd say they look relatively energy intensive (brutally cold, long winters), but they have cheap hydropower, so building there might make some sense. Hot dry desert cities (like Phoenix) have high cooling energy intensities, but their solar resource is excellent. I think this partially gets at part of Jim's argument -- it's not the energy that's the issue, it's the negative externalities (carbon emissions included) that are the issue. You might get a misleading result if you don't include the carbon-free energy availability dimension in your analysis.

If you combine a map you could generate from a passive energy screening tool with a map of carbon-free energy availability you could come up with something fairly compelling.

Dear Jeetendra,
You may be interested in this paper: http://www.bso14.org/BSO14_Papers/BSO14_Paper_071.pdf, where wide range of building forms are compared in all 17 ASHRAE 90.1 climate zones. Figure 5 in the paper may be a direct answer to your question 1 (and possibly 2), where you can see (office) buildings consumes on average 1/4 -1/3 of energy in temperate climates compared to the same buildings in the subarctic (zone 8) and the very hot (zone 1) climates.
Please note that this study was not designed for assessing the impact of climate, and it has only considered office buildings of the modern construction type. There are many complex factors in play; so you should not take those numbers literally. However, the importance of climate is well known in this community, and it should not be difficult to find literature on this subject. Come to think of it, looking up ?zero carbon buildings? and where they?ve been realized, may help you find answers to question 2.

Hi All,
Javed: Thank you for sharing the publication titles. Shall check soon.
Jim: I assume you are following the developments closely - http://c40.org/blog_posts/global-mayors-compact-shows-unity-and-ambition-to-tackle-climate-change. But I agree, we should be scientific in our approach. I often think of an argument - Can we handle the consequences if we are wrong about ignoring global warming? But, even if I go by the perspective of energy only, the question remains valid (PS). If emissions was the reason for your "No", please let me know your answer now. Besides, do send your comments on what Brian shared earlier as it shows that location does have an impact, if I am not missing something there.
Sincerely,
Jeetendra.
PS: Can our understanding of the impact of location on energy, esp due to natural factors, be used for planning where should we build cities in future, to conserve energy?

Jeetendra,

My opinion regarding your question: No (Impact of location on energy is not specially relevant.)

I wonder about your assumptions: I?ve seen sources which say that the globe has not warmed in over a decade.  This is different than many climate models? predictions and suggests that we don?t understand very well the impact of humans on the globe?s climate. One of my ardent wishes is that the climate discussion would become more scientific and less political.  At the moment, it seems hard to filter data from polemic.

I think it is very important to use resources wisely for a variety of reasons other than ?climate change?, but principal among them is to promote human flourishing.  Energy is a GOOD thing and even has a strong correlation to health and prosperity; limiting it?s availability, as has been part of recent discussion in the US, for many parts of the world might mean that they remain without refrigeration or reasonable heating and cooling  ? not so good for those people?s health and well-being.  Wasteful use or polluting are a different matter than thoughtful use.  I haven?t thought this through in great detail, but it seems that wise use of energy in one country makes more available for others at lower cost.  I like that thought.

Thanks for providing this link to the paper, which I've read with interest.  However, I'm 
puzzled because  my primary concern with respect to modeling green roofs is whether and 
how evapotranspiration has been handled and, unless I missed it in my quick read, I don't 
see that mentioned in the paper.

In brief, evapotranspiration is the process by which vegetation sheds excessive heat gain 
through transpiration, a process akin to sweating in animals for the same reason.  When I 
had worked with the Urban Heat Island Group at LBNL (before the group got formalized), my 
main interest was the effect of vegetation on counteracting the urban heat island, and 
very quickly I got enmeshed with evapotranspiration models both at the individual tree 
level (too detailed) or at the macro urban level (which I ended up applying in this 1987 
paper 
(http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0450%281987%29026%3C1103%3ATPOVIR%3E2.0.CO%3B2 
).

In another project that I was then doing on modeling foundation heat flows, I worked with 
another researcher at the Univ. of Minnesota who had a foundation model including the heat 
balance of the surrounding soil, who told me that he could get any ground surface 
temperature he wanted simply by playing around with the evapotranspiration rate  (which is 
really just the conversion of incoming solar radiation to latent heat).

Since a green roof is basically a shallow slice of ground with vegetation, wouldn't it 
make sense to add evapotranspiration to the model (if it doesn't handle it already) before 
looking for other explanations why measured and modeled results differ?  In my view, 
attributing these differences to the urban heat island effect is unsatisfying for these 
reasons: (1) it doesn't explain the cause and effect (although i would suspect that it's 
precisely the latent cooling of evapotranspiration), (2) it confounds a building-level 
strategy with a neighborhood-level phenomenon, i.e., you can be in an urban heat island 
(or oasis) without a green roof, as well as having a green roof somewhere with no urban 
heat island, (3) I am skeptical that a single green roof would have an appreciable effect 
on reducing the air temperature above the roof, unless the air is completely still (see 
http://heatisland.lbl.gov/publications/effects-roof-reflectance-air-temperat ).

Sorry, I missed ?2010? in the subject line ? My previous response is with specific regard to 90.1-2007.  

 

For (my) clarity, ?cg? isn?t a 90.1-2007 addenda, but specifically for 90.1-2010:  https://www.ashrae.org/standards-research--technology/standards-addenda 

 

90.1-2010 (pre-addenda) introduced table 9.6.2, but the Table G3.1 language is very similar to 90.1-2007 pre-addenda, with respect to lighting requirements.  

 

As I understand it, the procedure for 90.1-2010 (pre-addenda) is if you should choose to use the space-by-space method (for prescriptive compliance or for an Appendix G baseline model), part of coming up with your baseline LPD?s is adding the applicable controls credits in Table 9.6.2.  So if for example you have a 900ft2 classroom laboratory (Table 9.6.1 -> 1.28 W/ft2) with 522 Watts of installed lighting for which the proposed design uses Multi-level occupancy sensors (new glossary term), for all the lights, the baseline lighting power allowance for that space = 1.28*900 + 0.05*522 = 1152+26.1 = 1178.1 Watts, or 1.309 W/ft2.

 

Easy right?

 

I think the issue at hand here however is that Table G3.2, and the associated reference in Table G3.1, was not removed prior to addendum cg, so ?by the book? you are instructed to BOTH reduce proposed LPD?s per Table G3.2 AND add baseline controls credits (Table 9.6.2) to the baseline model per the prescriptive space by space method.  When I first noticed this, I assumed it was intentional? with 90.1?s powers-that-be deciding to amplify savings in this ?easy? fashion of just updating the prescriptive space-by-space approach rather than modifying/expanding upon Table G3.2 separately.  Seemed elegant at the time, in a way.

 

Addendum ?cg? to 90.1-2010 (found at the above site, also attached) however suggests this was ultimately considered ?double counting,? and there was never the intention to provide controls credit in both the baseline and proposed model.  So you now have 2 procedures involving Table 9.6.2:  for prescriptive compliance you must still add quantities determined via 9.6.2 to the allowable lighting power (the number you?re supposed to beat, on the whole), but for Appendix G you must instead subtract the same quantities from the proposed lighting power? 

 

This unfortunately means one can no longer simultaneously document prescriptive compliance while developing model documentation (but maybe I was the only one doing that)? bummer!

Hi Chris and Nick, 

 

Did some research and below is my observation: 

 

1. Instead of modifying the baseline, you will have to keep the same schedule (with consideration of mandatory lighting control requirement) in both proposed design and baseline. 

 

2. Meanwhile, LPD from Table 9.6.1 which is 1.23W/ft2 in your case, should remain the same in the baseline. 

 

3. For the spaces where no mandatory lighting control requirement, you can claim credit in the proposed design  by using: 

 

installed lighting power under control -  installed lighting power under control x control factor (table 9.6.2)

 

4. Without doing 3, you can also modify lighting schedule in the proposed design to claim non-mandatory control savings but you have to provide separate analysis 

 

Do you guys agree with my interpretation? Let me know your thoughts.

?Wait a minute, guys. I suddenly recall that Table G3.2 has been removed from Appendix G by its addendum cg. In the same addendum, Table 3.1/6.lighting has also been modified. I just quote the relevant part for your consideration: 

 

Proposed design

 

"e. The lighting schedules in the proposed building design shall reflect the mandatory automatic lighting control requirements in Section 9.4.1 (e.g., programmable controls or occupancy sensors). 

Exception: Automatic daylighting controls required by Section 9.4.1 shall be modeled directly in the proposed building design or through schedule adjustments determined by a separate daylighting analysis approved by the rating authority.

f. Automatic lighting controls included in the proposed building design but not required by Section 9.4.1 may be modeled directly in the building simulation or be modeled in the building simulation through schedule adjustments determined by a separate analysis approved by the authority having jurisdiction. As an alternative to modeling such lighting controls, the proposed building design lighting power density may be reduced by the sum of all additional allowances per Section 9.6.2c and Table 9.6.2, which are calculated individually as the lighting power under control multiplied by cf, where cf is the appropriate control factor given in Table 9.6.2 corresponding to the space type and the lighting controls designed to be used." 

 

Baseline

 

"c. Mandatory automatic lighting controls required by Section 9.4.1 shall be modeled the same as the proposed building design." 

 

It looks like section 9.6.2c and Table 9.6.2 will govern the calculation rather than Table G3.2.

As an example, if you had a proposed LPD of 0.90 installed in an office with occupancy sensors everywhere, you could model 0.81 for all spaces excepting the conference/break rooms, where you?d model the actual LPD.  

 

Incidentally, if you are performing an Appendix G model for LEED, I believe this is the approach pushed by the EAp2 workbook/footnotes.

 

Be cognizant that the inverse procedure you?ve proposed (amplifying the baseline LPD, instead of reducing the proposed LPD) may have the same net difference for lighting consumptions, but may result in a different (possibly helpful / possibly detrimental) overall Appendix G performance rating percentage, as you are now playing with distribution of the baseline?s internal loads instead of the proposed model?s.

 

Food for thought ;).

Yes, it is what I understand for ASHRAE appendix G baseline but not NECB baseline.

I am somewhat confused about calculating the baseline lighting power calculation, Space-By-Space method, with respect to lighting controls.

 

For example, Table G3.1 states ?Lighting shall be modeled having the automatic and manual controls in Section 9.4.  For a Conference/Meeting/Multipurpose room the LPD is 1.23 W/ft2.  9.4.1.2.(b) states that a conference room shall have an occupancy sensor.  Does this mean that the LPD is reduced by the factor listed in Table G3.2 is 10% for occupancy sensor in buildings greater than 5000 ft2.  So would the LPD for the baseline conference room be 1.23 * 0.9 = 1.1?

 

Thanks for your assistance!

I've been corresponding with Mayank offline and have determined that the cause for the 
difference is due entirely to the 30 minute difference between the GMT 5.50 time zone for 
India, and the GMT 5.0  integer time zone input into eQUEST.

I'm summarizing the e-mail exchange with Mayank below for those who may be curious as to 
the cause and solution for this discrepancy in solar radiation on different orientations.

Dear Joe,

Thanks for your response.

We took your recommendations and have been able to resolve the problems. Results for east 
and west facade are consistent for Eplus and eQuest post the longitude correction.I have 
attached these files for your reference as well.

Mayank,

I suspect that this discrepancy in the peaks is an artifact of the eQUEST/DOE-2 limitation 
of accepting only integer time-zones.
One way to adjust for this is to move the longitude of the building site by 7.5 degrees, 
i.e., if you input the time zone as 5, then  subtract 7.5 degrees from the building 
location, and if you input the time zone as 6, then add 7.5 degrees to the building location.

I was going to experiment with that, but then thought it would save some of my time if you 
could send me your eQUEST (*.inp) and EnergyPlus (*.idf) input files.  That would also 
clarify to me which variables you're pulling out as the solar radiation terms.

Thanks.

Dear Joe,

I am using the same weather file for both energy plus and eQuest. As eQuest uses BIN 
format I converted the same epw format file using eQ_wthProc tool (EPW to BIN converter). 
I have attached a spreadsheet (New Delhi_ISHRAE_2014EPW.xlsx)  that compares Total global 
Horizontal radiation and direct normal radiation for EPW file (by converting it into CSV 
format) and eQuest hourly outputs (as it reads BIN file). Since both the global horizontal 
and direct normal radiations are identical, conversion from epw to bin seems correct. 
Additionally, as you know, eQuest doesn't take diffused radiation from the weather file, 
it calculates itself.

Since I am using the same source file for both eQuest and Eplus simulations I would expect 
similar trend in solar radiation data for both East and West facades. However, for Delhi I 
found variation in solar radiation output for east and west facade. I have attached 
results spreadsheet (eQUest and energy plus_Miami and Delhi_v1.xlsx) for your reference.

Interestingly, when I performed a similar analysis for "Miami epw and bin file", I got 
fairly consistent results (refer graph below, the results are for June 6 to June 9)

I've been corresponding with Mayank offline and have determined that the cause for the difference is due entirely to the 30 minute difference between the GMT 5.50 time zone for India, and the GMT 5.0  integer time zone input into eQUEST.

I'm summarizing the e-mail exchange with Mayank below for those who may be curious as to the cause and solution for this discrepancy in solar radiation on different orientations.

Mayank,

I suspect that this discrepancy in the peaks is an artifact of the eQUEST/DOE-2 limitation of accepting only integer time-zones.
One way to adjust for this is to move the longitude of the building site by 7.5 degrees, i.e., if you input the time zone as 5, then  subtract 7.5 degrees from the building location, and if you input the time zone as 6, then add 7.5 degrees to the building location.

I was going to experiment with that, but then thought it would save some of my time if you could send me your eQUEST (*.inp) and EnergyPlus (*.idf) input files.  That would also clarify to me which variables you're pulling out as the solar radiation terms.

Thanks.

In-Reply-To: <5425C2C8.7020802@whiteboxtechnologies.com>
Message-ID: <df999d690ce84db07fd43e9cd0b074567f75df3c@webmail.iinet.net.au>



	Hi Joe, 

	A lot to think about below. In short I hadn't considered evapo
transpiration as we were trying to explain what was being observed for
a change in solar absportance on a metal deck roof?- a cool roof with
a solar absportance of about 0.15 to 0.2 relaive to a more
conventional metal deck roof with probably SA>0.5 allowing for ageing.
A vegetated roof certainly would introduce the issues you refere to
below. 

	There has been some further research since the 2011 paper which has a
bit more academic rigor (my paper was based on empirical observations
and rough calculations to make a point) and it shows that the bias can
be fairly significant even with a 3-5 m/s wind. The University of
Wollongong had carried out some advanced 3D CFD studies (sponsored by
two companies) to show the bias in above roof temperatures?and roof
surface temperatures (biased by the air temperature above being
higher) can be significant under many conditions.?The bias occurs on
any roof, but for small roofs it is insignificant compared to other
fcators so we ignore it but it acumulates / aggregates to create an
urban heat island. However for larger shopping centre airport, and
industrial roofs the impact can become quite significant (2-5DegC). It
is on roofs such as these that AC energy savings for cool roofs have
been measured to be significant - 4-5 times higher than what typically
gets simulated with a modern energy simulation engine. 

	With truly green roofs, I agree with you that the benefits are
significant. There is an interesting debate emerging in Australia
whether it is better to cover roofs in photovoltaics or make them
green. I saw something late last year that I think Art Rosenfeld
around whether it was better to make roofs white or green. I didn't
get a chance to revisit it so can't really comment on the artricle /
paper here. 

	I will try to remember to loop back on this forum / thread when the
research gets into the public realm. 

	Regards, 

	Graham

unless I missed it in my quick read, I don't see that mentioned in the
paper.

In brief, evapotranspiration is the process by which vegetation sheds
excessive heat gain through transpiration, a process akin to sweating
in animals for the same reason. ?When I had worked with the Urban
Heat Island Group at LBNL (before the group got formalized), my main
interest was the effect of vegetation on counteracting the urban heat
island, and very quickly I got enmeshed with evapotranspiration models
both at the individual tree level (too detailed) or at the macro urban
level (which I ended up applying in this 1987 paper
(http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0450%281987%29026%3C1103%3ATPOVIR%3E2.0.CO%3B2
[1] ).

In another project that I was then doing on modeling foundation heat
flows, I worked with another researcher at the Univ. of Minnesota who
had a foundation model including the heat balance of the surrounding
soil, who told me that he could get any ground surface temperature he
wanted simply by playing around with the evapotranspiration rate
?(which is really just the conversion of incoming solar radiation to
latent heat). ?

Since a green roof is basically a shallow slice of ground with
vegetation, wouldn't it make sense to add evapotranspiration to the
model (if it doesn't handle it already) before looking for other
explanations why measured and modeled results differ? ?In my view,
attributing these differences?to the urban heat island effect is
unsatisfying for these reasons: (1) it doesn't explain the cause and
effect?(although i would suspect that it's precisely the latent
cooling of evapotranspiration), (2) it confounds a building-level
strategy with a neighborhood-level phenomenon, i.e., you can be in an
urban heat island (or oasis) without a green roof, as well as having a
green roof somewhere with no urban heat island, (3) I am skeptical
that a single green roof would have an appreciable effect on reducing
the air temperature above the roof, unless the air is completely still
(see

But do all of these programs account fro the impact on the roof micro
climate? None to my knowledge do. When you get a large roof surface
the above roof air temperature bias can be 2-5DegC between a cool roof
(or green roof) and more historical roof (higher absoprtance). These
second order effects become essential to account for if you have
mechanical equipmnt on the roof as ventilation air and condesning
temperatures are impacted. We have been doing some research into this
area in Australia.?Think about the urban heat island effect at a
micro scale, becomes very important with big box retail, shopping
centres, industrial facilities, airports, maybe hospitals etc. for
shopping centres in Australia with AHUs on the roof, E+, DOE-2.2 and
IES only account for 20-25% of the cool roof benefits via th first
order effects. The second order effects due to the micro climate bias
are 3-4 times what is accounetd for within these programs ...  

	We haven't been able to get software developers to bring attention to
this so if others can shake the tree it would be good as the
workarounds while?possible are quite involved with a high degree of
uncertainty. There is a paper I wrote for IBPSA BS 2011 I can forward
when I get back from leave in a few weeks for those interested.

Thanks for the comments Jim!

Humans are indeed ingenious. But it takes more than creativity to grow food for 6 billion. It takes a lot of fertilizer and machinery. Increased food production has come with a huge fossil fuel cost<http://na.unep.net/geas/getUNEPPageWithArticleIDScript.php?article_id=81>. And we?re shooting past 7 billion on our way to 10 billion people over the next several decades. Oh, and water. We?ll need a lot more of that (but not too much at once<http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/deadly-heat-waves-flooding-rains-crop-failures-among-climate-change-plagues-already-afflicting-americans/>), at a time when climate change is changing the rain patterns that we?ve been used to since the dawn of agriculture. So much of our prosperity depends on resources that have no replacement, that are not going to be available in the quantities we need them. You can?t just invent replacements for oil and water.

Revenue-neutral carbon taxes are assessed at the source ? the gas/oil well or coal mine, when they are removed from the ground. The total fees collected are divided into equal shares to be distributed to everybody. The guy driving his RV 60 miles to the drag races each weekend will get the same check as the farmer that lives and works at his house. You can use it to pay for gas or to buy chicken feed. I will buy the less energy-intensive chicken feed because it will cost less. The idea is no more complicated than that. No bureaucrat picking the next Solyndra<http://time.com/2955312/obama-solyndraphobia-clean-energy/>. No cap-and-trade schemes. No ?carbon offsets? purchased like indulgences. And a lot of money circulating to put people to work building a genuine, consumer-driven, green economy.

Mr. Bishop has been thinking about this for a while!  That is the attitude we need for problem solving! (indifference never solves anything)

We?re slightly off-topic for Jeetendra, as Joel points out.  Continuing, though,  I think I?ll take a different tack on the discussion and ask that you consider an example of human flourishing?s impact on another issue of a few decades ago.
Remember when it was a ?certainty? that the globe could not sustain a population exceeding around 6 billion because we would never be able to provide enough food for them?  At the time this was stated, it was true.  The (naively) unaccounted-for resource was human creativity and ingenuity in food-growing processes.  We now can grow enough for the world in a small portion of the world!  The next problem is how to distribute it to those who need it, and that appears to be more an issue of willingness than technology.
In my own life, I know that when challenged by someone saying ?It can?t be done? or ?It can?t be done economically?, my response has been to try and prove them wrong ? and I have succeeded on a number of occasions! ? and I am just one among many other talented and motivated people.
For the issue of climate change, I?m much more inclined to assume that motivated and creative people can develop novel ways to thrive than that solutions will come as a result of a government-initiated program led by people with different and perhaps less-strong motivations.  Bill has it right, in my opinion, when saying ?And how do we do this ?, while minimizing the role of governments, respecting personal choice and freedoms, and letting market forces determine the most economically efficient paths toward a low-carbon future??  It?s complex, but we can do it.  A journey of a thousand miles begins with?

p.s., I was unfamiliar with the Carbon Fee & Dividend initiative until Bill provided the link, but at first glance it appears to encourage and incentivize GREATER fuel use ? the more we use, the more we receive from the fund?. On second thought, individuals may get back only pennies for each energy dollar spent, so it may not be a strong incentive.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] General query - impact of location on energy demand - climate science

Yes. (Consider energy use as a function of climate for city planning purposes.) Joel, Justin and Yi make good points below. I have never built a city before, but Planetary Overlord Bishop would also consider climate change impacts on agriculture, freshwater resources, extreme weather events, and (as Justin mentioned) availability of renewable resources (solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, ocean etc.). Then there?s things like access to transportation, walkability, ?sense of place?. Hopefully one of my minions would speak up before I did something like this<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryugyong_Hotel>.

Yes, climate change is happening, it is not natural, and we are causing it primarily by burning our once-in-a-civilization supply of fossil fuels as fast as we possibly can. The fundamentals of the greenhouse effect have been known since the 19th century, and temperatures have been rising just as we?d expect them to based on our emissions and other impacts. Following a sharp temperature spike to the hottest year on record in 1998 (caused by the strongest El Nino event ever recorded), global temperatures have remained high and have even continued to increase. We just had the highest May, June and August average temperatures<http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/2014/8>, and 2014 is on track to set another record high for global temperature (breaking the 2010 record). It has been nearly 30 years since we had a month that was below the 20th century average temperature for that month.

There is nothing political about the science. But our ideological biases get in the way when we consider solutions. We have to reduce fossil fuel use (not energy in general) and the only way to accomplish that is by government legislation. There are those that oppose the size and scope of governments, especially interference with the free market, and also those that sincerely believe that humans cannot possibly impact the planet (for religious reasons mostly). And plenty of people make their livelihoods and a lot of money off of fossil fuels<http://theenergycollective.com/jared-anderson/451466/not-my-balance-sheet-climate-change-fossil-fuels-and-stranded-assets>. So these biases understandably make it hard to find common ground with those whose biases include wanting to accelerate the transition to renewables, wanting to address wealth disparity, and general opposition to fossil fuels due to their other harmful impacts. Because of the implications of ?What do we do??, the science gets muddied by a combination of deliberate distortions and willful ignorance, happily perpetuated by ?think tanks?, news organizations and powerful individuals that attempt to spin the science to match their preferred narrative. Add countless blogs by non-scientists, a 24-hr news cycle that only pays lip-service to climate change, always maintaining false balance by presenting ?the other side?, and editorials that masquerade as science presented without accountability, and it is no surprise that we find ourselves in a quagmire of analysis paralysis.

Only when we recognize our own biases and acknowledge the reality of climate change as documented by the wealth of scientific evidence, does it make sense to discuss solutions. How do we rapidly reduce fossil fuel use, promote energy efficiency and renewables, decrease the energy use intensities of manufacturing, agriculture, transportation and (yes) the building stock, while reducing the impact of rising prices? And how do we do this in a way that gets all countries to follow suit, while minimizing the role of governments, respecting personal choice and freedoms, and letting market forces determine the most economically efficient paths toward a low-carbon future? The simple, elegant solution is a revenue-neutral carbon tax in the form of Carbon-Fee-&-Dividend<http://citizensclimatelobby.org/carbon-tax/>. You tax fossil fuels at the source, and distribute all collected fees to everyone equally, to spend as they please. We can avoid the worst effects of climate change without destroying the economy<http://climatecolab.org/web/guest/plans/-/plans/contestId/1300404/planId/2802>.

Guess I embellished my one-word answer a little bit.

Further off topic, but shouldn?t the question of energy use in city planning/human settlement in the future be focused on increased density or adaptive reuse in established, accessible locations rather than the further build out of virgin land regardless of how well-suited it might be for current ?sustainable? measures? It?s fairly well-supported that we do not have the same amount of traditional fuel sources available for use (or misuse, depending on your views). Why aren?t we asking ourselves how well-suited any given place on the planet is for meeting the current and projected energy needs using available technology at a given capital cost? To me, it?s counterintuitive to construct new cities in order to fight global warming. I?ve yet to see a large scale commercial/residential development, no matter how sustainable the technology and planning, actually be carbon neutral when embodied energy is considered. The analogy of buying something you don?t need at a 50% discount comes to mind.

I'm not directly on topic here, but I think the interesting question from a planning perspective is more like this:
Where can human settlement be done most inexpensively in a carbon-constrained world? I.e. When you combine the variety of weather/climate drivers on energy consumption with the availability of carbon-free energy supplies, where are the least expensive places to develop?

For example, if you looked at Labrador and Newfoundland, you'd say they look relatively energy intensive (brutally cold, long winters), but they have cheap hydropower, so building there might make some sense. Hot dry desert cities (like Phoenix) have high cooling energy intensities, but their solar resource is excellent. I think this partially gets at part of Jim's argument -- it's not the energy that's the issue, it's the negative externalities (carbon emissions included) that are the issue. You might get a misleading result if you don't include the carbon-free energy availability dimension in your analysis.

If you combine a map you could generate from a passive energy screening tool with a map of carbon-free energy availability you could come up with something fairly compelling.

Dear Jeetendra,
You may be interested in this paper: http://www.bso14.org/BSO14_Papers/BSO14_Paper_071.pdf, where wide range of building forms are compared in all 17 ASHRAE 90.1 climate zones. Figure 5 in the paper may be a direct answer to your question 1 (and possibly 2), where you can see (office) buildings consumes on average 1/4 -1/3 of energy in temperate climates compared to the same buildings in the subarctic (zone 8) and the very hot (zone 1) climates.
Please note that this study was not designed for assessing the impact of climate, and it has only considered office buildings of the modern construction type. There are many complex factors in play; so you should not take those numbers literally. However, the importance of climate is well known in this community, and it should not be difficult to find literature on this subject. Come to think of it, looking up ?zero carbon buildings? and where they?ve been realized, may help you find answers to question 2.

Hi All,
Javed: Thank you for sharing the publication titles. Shall check soon.
Jim: I assume you are following the developments closely - http://c40.org/blog_posts/global-mayors-compact-shows-unity-and-ambition-to-tackle-climate-change. But I agree, we should be scientific in our approach. I often think of an argument - Can we handle the consequences if we are wrong about ignoring global warming? But, even if I go by the perspective of energy only, the question remains valid (PS). If emissions was the reason for your "No", please let me know your answer now. Besides, do send your comments on what Brian shared earlier as it shows that location does have an impact, if I am not missing something there.
Sincerely,
Jeetendra.
PS: Can our understanding of the impact of location on energy, esp due to natural factors, be used for planning where should we build cities in future, to conserve energy?

Jeetendra,

My opinion regarding your question: No (Impact of location on energy is not specially relevant.)

I wonder about your assumptions: I?ve seen sources which say that the globe has not warmed in over a decade.  This is different than many climate models? predictions and suggests that we don?t understand very well the impact of humans on the globe?s climate. One of my ardent wishes is that the climate discussion would become more scientific and less political.  At the moment, it seems hard to filter data from polemic.

I think it is very important to use resources wisely for a variety of reasons other than ?climate change?, but principal among them is to promote human flourishing.  Energy is a GOOD thing and even has a strong correlation to health and prosperity; limiting it?s availability, as has been part of recent discussion in the US, for many parts of the world might mean that they remain without refrigeration or reasonable heating and cooling  ? not so good for those people?s health and well-being.  Wasteful use or polluting are a different matter than thoughtful use.  I haven?t thought this through in great detail, but it seems that wise use of energy in one country makes more available for others at lower cost.  I like that thought.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] EnergyPlus V8.2.0 Release
Message-ID: <542B4847.3000706@gard.com>

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has released EnergyPlus V8.2.0, the 
first release of EnergyPlus built on C++ source code.  New feature 
highlights are listed below.  For more information about EnergyPlus, 
please visit www.energyplus.gov

Installers and source code for V8.2.0 are available at

The EnergyPlus Development Team

****************************
Highlights of this release (V8.2.0)

Core Changes to EnergyPlus
*Internal simulation engine code translated from FORTRAN to C++ to spur 
the evolution of EnergyPlus through improved interaction with a larger 
community through a more popular code base, and improved access to code 
libraries for performance and enhanced capabilities.

*Language change initially caused a slightly slower codebase due to 
translation overhead, however several restructuring efforts in the code 
eventually led to EnergyPlus V8.2.0 being faster than V8.1 in many tests 
cases.

*Development transitioned to GitHub, where the source code is to be made 
fully public in the spirit of the open source license.

General
*Bug fixes throughout.

Building Envelope
*Integrated slab calculation now allow improved simulation of ground 
heat transfer

HVAC, Plant and Refrigeration
*Improved sizing algorithm for including fan heat in cooling coil 
calculations
*Improved sizing input options for scaling autosized values
*Additional plant load dispatch algorithms based on meeting component 
part-loading targets
*New models for single-sided natural ventilation with multiple openings
*New on/off fan option for unit heater and unit ventilator
*New fault model for coil fouling
*DOAS direct to zonal water-to-air heat pumps
*Expanded support for table lookup for plant equipment performance
*New zone air mass flow balance option (partially link HVAC flows with 
zone mixing and infiltration)

Utilities
*Ice storage curve-fit tool

Platforms
*Windows 7 & 8: 64-bit version (32-bit may be available via Helpdesk)
*Linux (Ubuntu 14.04 and compatible) 64 bit versions; (32-bit and 
RHEL-compatible versions may be available via Helpdesk)
*Mac OSX 10.9 64 bit versions
*EnergyPlus V8.2.0 has been tested on all of these platforms
