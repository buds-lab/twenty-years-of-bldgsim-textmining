In November '03, the IBPSA News Vol. 13, No. 2 was revised and updated
on the IBPSA web site (http://www.ibpsa.org <http://www.ibpsa.org/> )
after it was noticed that I had inadvertently left out a software
announcement from Alware of Germany.  This addition is now included as
well the ISC'2004 conference announcement from Philippe Geril of
Belgium.  In case you've missed looking at the revised BPSA News, you
can find it at http://www.ibpsa.org/IBPSANews-13-2r.pdf.  Deadlines for
abstracts and papers for the ISC'2004 conference are imminent, so look
at this right away if you are interested.
 
Note to Affilate Reps: If you are managing any IBPSA Affiliate web sites
that link to the IBPSA News, please make note that the most recent issue
in Vol. 13, No. 2.    News contributions for the next issue (Vol. 14,
No. 1) are due by 21 March 2004.
 
Best wishes for '04 !!!

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200401080540.AA4052468pd80000551824@gard.com>

Please forward this email to anyone else who might have an
interest...

IBPSA (Scotland) also known as The Scottish Energy Systems Group (SESG), 
in conjunction with the Solar Energy Laboratory of the University of 
Wisconsin-Madison, are sending this message to see if there is 
sufficient interest to run a TRNSYS introductory course in Glasgow 
Scotland in May of 2004.

TRNSYS has an active user community and local expertise in many parts 
of the world, but is exceedingly rare in the UK. SESG exists to help
practitioners to make better use of design decision support software.
SESG has used hands-on experience with a tool and access to an 
expert/developer to help our members evaluate software and make
informed decisions about simulation tool deployment.

If there is sufficient interest, Michael Kummert of SEL would be
prepared to give a two day introductory course for up to a dozen
participants. The course fee (excluding accommodation) will be 400 
Pounds. If the course if fully subscribed the first six SESG members
will get a discounted fee of 275 Pounds. If there are fewer 
participants then fewer discounts will be offered.

SESG is discussing with TRNSYS vendors to see if discounts on
the software might be offered to course participants. There is a
tick box in the reply form to mark if you would be interested
in joining such a scheme.

Please have a look at the schedule below and if you have an interest
in attending, please return the form at the bottom of the email to 
Jon Hand <jon at sesg.strath.ac.uk>

Dear Building Simulation Colleagues,

We are pleased to announce the release of GenOpt 2.0.0.

GenOpt is an optimization program for the minimization of a ?cost 
function? (such as annual energy use, peak electrical demand, utility 
cost, etc.) that is evaluated by an external simulation program.

For example, you can compute a building's annual energy cost in 
EnergyPlus, TRNSYS, SPARK, DOE-2, or any simulation program with 
text-based input and output, and let GenOpt automatically find the 
values of selected parameters that yield lowest cost.

GenOpt has a library with local and global multi-dimensional and 
one-dimensional optimization algorithms, as well as algorithms for doing 
parametric studies.

For free download and more information, please visit
http://SimulationResearch.lbl.gov/GO

Thank you for your interest in GenOpt.

Sincerely,

Michael Wetter

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200401311848.AA4836203pd80000584376@gard.com>

Analyzing my summer component loads for Atlanta GA, I discover that the net
sensible effect of infiltration is negative.  In other words, infiltration
sensibly overall cools my house during the summer.  The infiltration latent
effect is as it should be, adding heat into the house.  When I view
pre-existing data on summer infiltration effects on homes the reported
effect is that it heats the house.  I am wondering if data showing sensible
cooling effect of infiltration during the summer is legitamate and that the
published summer effects of infiltration adds the latent and sensible
infiltration effects together to get a rough estimate of the overall
infiltration effect during the summer.

Thanks
Ian

I agree with David's advice on approach.  There are many tools that will
allow you to gain some insight into double skin facades, but you need to
understand first principles so that you know when you are stretching your
analysis tool beyond its capability ...  Your tool(s) of choice will depend
on whether you are talking about internally or externally ventilated
facades, whether the facade is used as part of a natural ventilation system,
and whether you want to look at just the energy impact or thermal comfort
aspects as well ... based on this you may find a DOE-2 sunspace gives you
some of the direction you are looking for or alternatively you can start to
look at TAS (by EDSL) or Apache (by IES) to look at energy / comfort to
allow you to draw some broad conclusions on what the value of the facade is
and the critical variables.

With respect to the discussions on cost, a double skin facade will never
stack up if viewed as an energy efficiency measure in isolation.  There are
the obvious opportunities for architectural expression, but teh key drivers
will always be the improvements in thermal comfort and the additional system
options that emerge by knocking out 90%+ of the solar load.  Chilled
ceilings are not feasible at the perimeter unless the solar is controlled.
Similarly the capacity of passive chilled beams will be stretched unless the
skin load is adequately taken care of.

Lend Lease's new head office in Sydney (The Bond) will feature passive
chilled beams with the dominant western facade facing over the harbour
protected by operable external blinds.  The blinds retract during high winds
so don't require the second skin.  Many double skin applications have
effectively been a wind buffer allowing the use of cavity blinds in summer
(wind or no wind) and closing the cavity in winter to buffer temperatures
and increase the insulation value of the glazed portion of the facade ...

There are no commercially available energy simulation tools, I am aware of,
that will simulate the complexity of a double skin fa?ade.  The performance
of these systems varies dramatically with the type of fa?ade and its
interaction with the building's HVAC system.  At best, I would suggest you
dig into the research and publications to determine what kind of system you
wish to model, then begin to develop a set of assumptions you can use in the
analysis. When modeling an advanced fa?ade, one should go back to first
principles.  Best of luck!

> If so, how to?

I am not aware of an accurate way to simulate a double skin facade in
eQUEST, but a quick back-of-the-envelope analysis may suffice to draw
conclusions about this concept:

1.  Assume your building costs $150/sq.ft. to build, and that the
double-skin is 10% of that cost, or $15.
2.  Assume that energy for the building costs $1.25/sq.ft./year, and that
the double-skin saves 25% of the total energy budget, or $0.31/sq.ft./year.
(In many buildings, lights and plug loads comprise about half the energy
cost, and this analysis assumes the double-skin has no impact on either.  So
this guestimate is based on the double skin saving 50% of the HVAC costs,
which seems quite optimistic.)
3.  The simple payback is then $15/$0.31 = 48 years.  This assumes an
opportunity cost of 0%, and no additional operating and/or maintenance
costs. If the actual interest rate is 5%,
the annual interest cost is $15*0.05 = $0.75/year; or more than twice the
energy savings.  Given the interest cost, the double-skin would have to
eliminate ALL of the HVAC energy, and a portion of the lighting as well.

So, is a double-skin facade worthwhile?  Unless the assumed cost of the
double skin is high by a factor of at least 3, this concept does not appear
worth considering.

Does anyone have any better information on construction costs and energy
savings of an actual building using a double-skin facade?  To me, this
concept is so far out in left field that I don't understand why there is so
much interest in it.

>

> eQuest?

I'm not sure what you mean by a dynamic facade.  In regards to dynamic
shading in eQUEST, you can define a schedule that modifies the transmittance
of a building shade.

> One that incorporates Photovoltaics?

Yes, eQUEST simulates photovoltaics.  The PV modules can be mounted
stand-alone, or incorporated as part of a building shade.  Be sure to use a
recent version, as the photovoltaic algorithms were upgraded last fall.
Study the PV-MODULE and ELEC-GENERATOR sections in the DOE-2.2 Dictionary.

S. Hassid, Ed,

That is correct. I remember that Tsinghua University had a project about
8-10 years ago where they modeled metro stations in Teheran, Iran, using CFD
to study smoke control strategies.  The best person to contact at Tsinghua
is Dr. JIANG Yi (Jiang is the family name) at jiangyi at tsinghua.edu.cn.

If you have a 70C thermostat setpoint, your house must be close to the
Martian lander site (158F). I assume you mean 70F.

You need a load simulation program to simulate the house, or use a Bin
temperature setup to establish heating and cooling loads. Since your house
is running 24/7, the Bin Method is very appropriate, and the 8,760 loading
will break down into all heating or all cooling loads. Assuming 70F is both
the heating and the cooling setpoint, you can determine total hours cooling
and total hours heating LOAD.

Then subtract off the hours your cooling and heating system ran. You will
then have the load hours happening when the HVAC is not running.

There are Bin Method experts out there who can explain it much better. But I
believe this is your gist.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] determining summer vs winter loads


I have a years worth of energy data for a house.  I am wondering how to
break it up into what contributes to the overall heating load and what
contributes to the overall cooling load.  So far, all the energy data during
hours the HVAC system is heating goes to the heating load and likewise, all
the energy data during hours the HVAC system is cooling goes to the cooling
load.  Pretty straight forward.  Yet I am wondering how to break up those
hours when the HVAC system is off.  Right now all I do is put data into
heating load if the hourly outside drybulb temperature is less then my
inside temperature set point (70 C) and the rest of these hours into my
cooling load.  This is just a rough estimate.  I am wondering if there is a
set benchmark for breaking up the cooling and heating loads.

Thanks

Hi Leela-

Another report you can use is the LS-C which gives the peak load per
building component, i.e. wall conduction, roof conduction, window
conduction, window solar gain, etc.  When making similar comparisons, I
usually don't bother with the LS-F report but use the BEPU &/or the BEPS
along with the LS-A report you mentioned.  I find the BEP reports easier to
use than the LS-F unless you're looking for more detailed info.

I hope this helps.  Have a nice weekend.

Hi,

I am comparing a couple of insulation materials and
their effect on load and energy consumption of a
building using DOE2 programs. I would like to carry
out similar exercise for windows. I am not sure which
output data should I use for comparison. I think it
would be more appropriate to use loads at space level
i.e. use LS-A (KBTU//hr)for peak load and LS-F
(MBTU)for energy instead of PS reports. This can give
the contribution of individual components as well. Am
I making any mistake here? Any suggestions will be
highly appreciated.

Thanks

Thanks for that reply.  I was actually looking for back ground on the 
Lighting Control Power Adjustment Factors as outlined in ASHRAE 90.1-1989 
Section 6.4.3.  For example, for daylighting, on/off control the PAF is 0.1.

These factors recognize the fact that different space types have different dimensions that will effect the required LPD to light a room.

It was recognized early in the 90.1-1999 development process that specific space types generally had consistent RCR categories within that space type.

If you don't have the time to learn up esp-r, you may use ies virtual 
environment that is modeled after esp-r. although not as 
comprehensive as esp-r, it provides the necessary bulk network flow 
coupled with energy simulation to give a good prediction of double 
skin.

The only way a double skin pays off is if it replaces most of the VAC 
part of the HVAC system, greatly decreasing the net cost in the payback 
numerator. This may only be possible where the design conditions are  
moderate such as northern Europe or some maritime climates. High Euro 
energy costs, and use of the interstitial space for daylighting 
parephenalia will increase the denominator.

If that is possible, the numbers might look like 
($15-10+)/($0.31*2+/year) equals under 9 years. The architect gets a 
"transparent" building, and it might be worth the simulation time. But 
you might not want to hang out on the top floor during a heat storm like 
last summer's.

Greg,

It probably depends on what type of lab building it is.  If the labs are
going to be controlled by space conditions and don't have any unusual
exhaust requirements, you can probably do this in the systems tab.  As you
define your air handling system, click the check box for return fan
(return/exhaust) and define it as variable speed.  You'll need to define the
supply fan as variable speed also.  If it is a 100% outside air system, make
sure you check the box for min. O.A. and input 100%.

This could get a little trickier if you have a lab with fume hoods and VAV
sash controllers.  In this instance, you might have to interview or observe
the occupants to get an idea of the typical operation of the hoods and sash
positions.  In this instance you can probably define the air handling system
as 100% outdoor air and variable volume reheat with the variable speed
return/exhaust fan.  Based on the interview or observations, it's probably
possible to come up with an hourly fraction schedule to apply to outdoor
air.  If the sashes are generally closed, make sure you still maintain a
negative pressure in relation to the corridor outside.  If I remember
correctly, the fraction schedule should override the fan operating on/off
schedule and vary the air quantity and fan kW.

There are no commercially available energy simulation tools, I am aware of,
that will simulate the complexity of a double skin fa?ade.  The performance
of these systems varies dramatically with the type of fa?ade and its
interaction with the building's HVAC system.  At best, I would suggest you
dig into the research and publications to determine what kind of system you
wish to model, then begin to develop a set of assumptions you can use in the
analysis. When modeling an advanced fa?ade, one should go back to first
principles.  Best of luck!

I am not aware of an accurate way to simulate a double skin facade in
eQUEST, but a quick back-of-the-envelope analysis may suffice to draw
conclusions about this concept:

1.  Assume your building costs $150/sq.ft. to build, and that the
double-skin is 10% of that cost, or $15.
2.  Assume that energy for the building costs $1.25/sq.ft./year, and that
the double-skin saves 25% of the total energy budget, or $0.31/sq.ft./year.
(In many buildings, lights and plug loads comprise about half the energy
cost, and this analysis assumes the double-skin has no impact on either.  So
this guestimate is based on the double skin saving 50% of the HVAC costs,
which seems quite optimistic.)
3.  The simple payback is then $15/$0.31 = 48 years.  This assumes an
opportunity cost of 0%, and no additional operating and/or maintenance
costs. If the actual interest rate is 5%,
the annual interest cost is $15*0.05 = $0.75/year; or more than twice the
energy savings.  Given the interest cost, the double-skin would have to
eliminate ALL of the HVAC energy, and a portion of the lighting as well.

So, is a double-skin facade worthwhile?  Unless the assumed cost of the
double skin is high by a factor of at least 3, this concept does not appear
worth considering.

Does anyone have any better information on construction costs and energy
savings of an actual building using a double-skin facade?  To me, this
concept is so far out in left field that I don't understand why there is so
much interest in it.

>
> Is it possible to simulate a dynamic fa?ade with

I'm not sure what you mean by a dynamic facade.  In regards to dynamic
shading in eQUEST, you can define a schedule that modifies the transmittance
of a building shade.

> One that incorporates Photovoltaics?

Yes, eQUEST simulates photovoltaics.  The PV modules can be mounted
stand-alone, or incorporated as part of a building shade.  Be sure to use a
recent version, as the photovoltaic algorithms were upgraded last fall.
Study the PV-MODULE and ELEC-GENERATOR sections in the DOE-2.2 Dictionary.

Does anyone know if eQuest allows you to have no drop

Also, is there an option

The process is quite simple in the wizard. You can either create your own custom rate structure (the custom option under utility in the first window), or if you are importing a rate structure, you click on the file option in the same window. If you are importing a rate file, it has to be stored in the eQUEST folder under the sub folder 'rates' with the extension *.ert for electric rates, and *.grt for gas rates. 
Hope this helps

You don't really need to make your own file. eQuest has a feature called Utility and Economics and you can create utility rates in there. Let me know if you have questions doing so.

Hello everybody, first of all, thank you for your support
 
I?m using eQUEST to simulate some buildings. I have a list with some equipment that the buildings have, for example: computer (3000 W), microwave (2200 W), fridge (2000 W), lights(2000 W), elevator (30000 W).....
 
I know that some of this loads contributes to space loads and some doesn?t, but I don?t know how much of the power really contributes for each load
 
Is there any web where I can know which part of this power enters the space depending on the kind of load?
 
How does eQUEST handle what you write in the fields? does it suppose that all this power contributes as a sensible heat load?
 
To sum up, what should I write in eQUEST to take into account my different kinds of loads?

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200401231305.AA0501921pd80000572605@gard.com>

Varkie,
 
The answer to your question is Yes.  LEED is going to allow the inclusion of daylighting as part of EA1.  They have been working with ASHRAE to develop Appendix G for ASHARAE 90.1-2001 Energy Code.  Appendix G provides a methodology for modeling the energy performance of a building using ASHRAE 90.1-2001 as the baseline.  I think (don't quote me) the intent is that LEED will adopt Appednix G as an acceptable methodology for determining energy performance.  The methodology addresses many of the issues that are not addressed by the Cost Budget Method to show code compliance.  Appendix G will not replace the Cost Budget Method as a means for showing code compliance.  
 
Appendix G has not been officially released by ASHRAE, I am sure it will be soon though.
 
Here is some of what it says about the simulation of lighting systems that pertains to your question.
 
(f) Credit may be taken for the use of automatic controls for daylight utilization but only if their operation is either modeled directly in the building simulation or modeled in the building simulation through schedule adjustments determined by a separate daylighting analysis approved by the rating authority.
(g) For automatic lighting controls in addition to those required for minimum code compliance under 9.2, credit may be taken for automatically controlled systems by reducing the connected lighting power by the applicable percentages listed in Table G3.8. Alternatively, credit may be taken for these devices by modifying the lighting schedules used for the proposed design provided credible technical documentation for the modifications are provided to the rating authority. Table G3.8 is shown below.

Lighting power in the baseline building design shall be determined using the same categorization procedure (Building Area or Space Function) and categories as the proposed design with lighting power set equal to the maximum allowed for the corresponding method and category in 9.3. No automatic lighting controls (e.g., programmable controls or automatic controls for daylight utilization) shall be modeled in the baseline building design, as the lighting schedules used are understood to reflect the mandatory control requirements in this standard.
Hope this helps.

Can day-lighting controls be considered for LEED certification under "Energy & Atmosphere - Optimize Energy Performance"?  If so where should the light sensor be located in the space?  Is there any energy code that allows credit for day-lighting controls? The DOE2 program allows two light sensors per space.  Supposing the two sensors are located 5 ft and 10 ft from the window.  Is the average daylight at these two points used in determining the reduction in artificial lighting?
 
The DOE2 program expects zones to have 6 surfaces defined with X,Y,Z coordinates and reflectance values for day-lighting analysis.  Ignoring this produces warning messages but the results show a reduction in artificial lighting energy.  For day-lighting analysis we only enter into DOE2 the X,Y coordinates of the window origin relative to the wall and also the wall and window dimensions.  Can we assume that the energy savings results from the DOE2 program are on the safe side (the actual energy saved is more) when we use the program without all the surfaces and coordinates?
 
Are there any rules for day-lighting analysis for establishing energy savings and for comparing the results from different studies?

Varkie - 
 
You raise an old issue (old, in the sense that when I was on the ECB
subcommittee leading up to the adoption of  90.1-1999 we spent a lot of
time talking about this) - how to ensure that th eintent of the standard
is not defeated by the detailed modeling decisions of the analyst.
 
California has a long history of providing detailed technical
specifications for modeling software (or a front end thereto) to ensure
that simulations are done correctly for compliance.  Indeed, one can
only use CEC-certified compliance software for that purpose. The user
inputs and the user interface are specified, modeling assumptions are
built into the software, and outputs are standardized.
 
For 90.1, the committee did not have the resources to develop a
comparably detailed specification.  The effort of the committee was to
clearly state the intention of the standard, and to describe in concise
terms how the proposed and budget designs were to be modeled consistent
with the rest of the standard.  The expectation was that private vendors
would take it from there and generate compliance software that met the
intent of the standard, as well as any locally adopted variations in the
states and jurisdictions that would adopt 90.1.  It was left to the
adopting authorities to certify the software for compliance purposes.
There was even some talk of ASHRAE getting into this business, but no
leadership emerged to capitalize on this opportunity.
 
So that was the intent for how the problems you raise would be
addressed.  I haven't followed the story very closely since then, but it
is my impression that compliance software has not emerged, and that
there is therefore a lot of opportunity for analysts to game the ECB
method. I hope I'm wrong about this.
 
Doug.

	Thanks for your response.  The percent glass of all building
envelopes designed by architects in this office is greater than 50%.
This has to do with exterior appearance, indoor working conditions,
building construction costs, exterior maintenance costs and client
satisfaction.  So we always have to use the energy cost budget method to
show code compliance.  We have been doing this with DOE21.E.  First
analyze the building with Std90 criteria (50% glass with Table B
properties, lighting densities, EERs, COPs, etc.) and then with the
proposed building design using more efficient glass, lights, systems,
equipment and renewable energy sources that will produce less than or
equal to energy use and cost (using thermal storage, etc.) results.  The
attachment to our energy report includes the DOE2 output BDL for the
base and the proposed designs as verification.  I assume we can use this
procedure to show energy savings from day-lighting controls under
Building Envelope Trade-Off Options of Std90, Section 5.4 and
Appendix-C.  Can any other computer program, other than DOE2.1E, be used
to show ECB compliance?

	 

	Based on the responses I received regarding day-lighting and
LEED certification, I could cheat and locate the light sensor in a
perimeter space in the DOE2 program run, so that it produces the highest
lighting energy savings results.  The single sensor location could
represent a space with a perimeter depth of 50 ft or more and any floor
area.  I could also use a computer program that produces higher lighting
energy savings than some other computer program.  Title 24 code requires
compliance using specific computer programs and there are instructions
on using the programs so that everyone is on the same playing field.  I
think the location of the sensors and the geometry of the space (without
going into the X,Y,Z coordinates of all the interior walls since there
aren't any in base speculative office building design) should be
considered in energy codes.

	 

	Can 5 cfm per person of outdoor air be used for all types of
commercial (non-industrial) spaces if the filtration system can produce
the same indoor air quality as, say, 20 cfm per person for an office
space?  Does this qualify under "Energy Cost Budget" and "Energy &
Atmosphere - Optimize Energy Performance"?

	 

	I apologize for sounding so ignorant?  Since we have to use
computer programs to show energy code compliance, the developers of the
programs should adjust the program input and output to make it easier to
use the programs to show code compliance.  We were once asked to show
Std90 compliance for an architecturally complex performing arts center
using ComCheck-Plus.  We had to create an equivalent rectangular box
with 5 zones to do this.  It could have been done with DOE2.1E using the
procedure described above.

	 

	Should I send this message to the BLDG-SIM group?  I don't know
who are out there and whether I am making a fool of myself

under "Energy & Atmosphere - Optimize Energy Performance"?  If so where
should the light sensor be located in the space?  Is there any energy
code that allows credit for day-lighting controls? The DOE2 program
allows two light sensors per space.  Supposing the two sensors are
located 5 ft and 10 ft from the window.  Is the average daylight at
these two points used in determining the reduction in artificial
lighting?

	 

	The DOE2 program expects zones to have 6 surfaces defined with
X,Y,Z coordinates and reflectance values for day-lighting analysis.
Ignoring this produces warning messages but the results show a reduction
in artificial lighting energy.  For day-lighting analysis we only enter
into DOE2 the X,Y coordinates of the window origin relative to the wall
and also the wall and window dimensions.  Can we assume that the energy
savings results from the DOE2 program are on the safe side (the actual
energy saved is more) when we use the program without all the surfaces
and coordinates?

	 

	Are there any rules for day-lighting analysis for establishing
energy savings and for comparing the results from different studies?

Thanks for your response.  The percent glass of all building envelopes
designed by architects in this office is greater than 50%.  This has to
do with exterior appearance, indoor working conditions, building
construction costs, exterior maintenance costs and client satisfaction.
So we always have to use the energy cost budget method to show code
compliance.  We have been doing this with DOE21.E.  First analyze the
building with Std90 criteria (50% glass with Table B properties,
lighting densities, EERs, COPs, etc.) and then with the proposed
building design using more efficient glass, lights, systems, equipment
and renewable energy sources that will produce less than or equal to
energy use and cost (using thermal storage, etc.) results.  The
attachment to our energy report includes the DOE2 output BDL for the
base and the proposed designs as verification.  I assume we can use this
procedure to show energy savings from day-lighting controls under
Building Envelope Trade-Off Options of Std90, Section 5.4 and
Appendix-C.  Can any other computer program, other than DOE2.1E, be used
to show ECB compliance?

 

Based on the responses I received regarding day-lighting and LEED
certification, I could cheat and locate the light sensor in a perimeter
space in the DOE2 program run, so that it produces the highest lighting
energy savings results.  The single sensor location could represent a
space with a perimeter depth of 50 ft or more and any floor area.  I
could also use a computer program that produces higher lighting energy
savings than some other computer program.  Title 24 code requires
compliance using specific computer programs and there are instructions
on using the programs so that everyone is on the same playing field.  I
think the location of the sensors and the geometry of the space (without
going into the X,Y,Z coordinates of all the interior walls since there
aren't any in base speculative office building design) should be
considered in energy codes.

 

Can 5 cfm per person of outdoor air be used for all types of commercial
(non-industrial) spaces if the filtration system can produce the same
indoor air quality as, say, 20 cfm per person for an office space?  Does
this qualify under "Energy Cost Budget" and "Energy & Atmosphere -
Optimize Energy Performance"?

 

I apologize for sounding so ignorant?  Since we have to use computer
programs to show energy code compliance, the developers of the programs
should adjust the program input and output to make it easier to use the
programs to show code compliance.  We were once asked to show Std90
compliance for an architecturally complex performing arts center using
ComCheck-Plus.  We had to create an equivalent rectangular box with 5
zones to do this.  It could have been done with DOE2.1E using the
procedure described above.

 

Should I send this message to the BLDG-SIM group?  I don't know who are
out there and whether I am making a fool of myself

Just a side note of interest (with no judgment inferred):

 

ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-1999 no longer allows lighting control
credits.  Compliance is based on connected lighting power alone.  With
the 1989 Standard, credits could be taken for automatic controls/sensors
and daylighting controls.  (Inference about the dependability of
lighting sensors/controls??? - I don't know.)

 

Furthermore, VLT (Visible Light Transmittance) is not considered in the
Prescriptive Envelope Option, but it is considered in the Envelope
Trade-off Option, a la Chapter 5 (Sect. 5.3.2.4 and 5.4).

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Heat gain from light pipes
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200401221252.AA5232468pd80000571057@gard.com>

 
Hi Vikram, 
 
The latest release of EnergyPlus (v. 1.1.1) added a model for light pipes, i.e. tubular daylighting devices.  The model is fully described in the documentation that comes with the program.  
 
Just to give you an idea in brief, light pipes can add both solar gains and conductive/convective gains to the space below.  The solar gains are calculated by analyzing the multiple internal reflections of the incident beam, sky, and ground radiation entering the pipe.  The amount of radiation transmitted depends on the incident angle, reflectivity, and geometry of the pipe, and on the properties of the glazing at either end of the pipe.  Fortunately, all of this is entirely handled by the program.  
 
The conductive/convective gains, on the other hand, require the user to enter an effective thermal resistance (R-value) between the top and bottom of the light pipe.  The problem is knowing what R-value to use.  Very little research has been done on this area of the problem (as of about 1 year ago--the last time I looked).  I have only found one paper that analyzes the conductive/convective behavior of light pipes:  
 
Harrison, S. J., McCurdy, G. G., Cooke, R.  "Preliminary Evaluation of the Daylighting and Thermal Performance of Cylindrical Skylights", Proceedings of International Daylight Conference, Ottawa, Canada, 1998, pp. 205-212.
 
They report an average thermal resistance of 0.279 m2 K/W for a pipe measuring 1.83 m by 0.33 m.  
 
Hope this helps!

Dear Varkie,
 
I agree with Jon that 
(a) Sensor placement has a huge impact on the results.
(b) I wouldn't expect that [not providing a geometry] would be an acceptable
method since you really do not know what you are modeling. 
 
With respect to your earlier question I believe that even if you do provide
geometry data, DOE2 saving predictions will be on the optimistic side. One
flaw of basically all simulation programs that predict electric lighting
savings due to lighting controls is that they tend to compare an ideally
dimmed lighting system with a lighting system as is permanently switched on
during occupied hours. This leads to overly optimistic savings, as the IESNA
handbook rightfully states: "an undimmed lighting system with a regular
on/off wall switch should be the reference system". To be able to compare
results to manually controlled lighting, you need a user behavior model that
predicts how individuals interact with their manual lighting controls.
Another aspect you should pay attention to is the blind control algorithm.
If the blinds are permanently retracted, you will again predict wildly
overoptimistic savings. I think there is a way in DOE2 to set the blind
control to manual.
 
If you want to develop a feeling for electric lighting savings due to
controls, you might want to use the Lightswitch Wizard, www.buildwiz.com
<http://www.buildwiz.com> , a simple online daylighting analysis tool that
is based on pre-calculated RADIANCE simulations and a manual lighting
control model. The model has been developed based on field data from several
countries and is currently further refined within International Energy
Agency's Task 31, Daylight Buildings in the 21st Century.

Varkie,
 
California's Title 24 energy code has established values of energy
credits for daylighting controls.  These credits are used in both the
prescriptive approach and the performance method which is based upon an
energy simulation.  For the LEED credits the performance method would be
used as you are trying to estimate the energy consumption as a fraction
of the consumption of a minimally compliant building. The current tool
is EnergyPro which is DOE-2.1E with a user interface that places some
limits on inputs and automatically creates a reference or minimally code
compliance comparison case.  
 
The lighting power of controlled lighting that is in the daylit zone (no
more than 15 feet from a window and currently no more than 1 ceiling
height horizontally from a skylight) is reduced by a Power Adjustment
Factor (PAF).  The factor is a function of the visible transmittance and
the fraction of wall area for glazing.  Though this doesn't capture peak
reduction effects, the simplicity of the method provides some confidence
in the results.  Sensor placement has a huge impact on the results.
 
The Title 24 standards can be downloaded from:
http://www.energy.ca.gov/title24/
 
I don't know what rule set is involved for daylighting in DOE-2 when a
geometry is not described.  I wouldn't expect that this would be an
acceptable method since you really do not know what you are modeling.
The bottom line is that your model approximates what your daylighting
design does and that the design would reasonably save energy - thus a
lighting design that does not provide the desired light levels in all
the task locations would not likely provide maintained savings.
Modeling two sensors does not make any sense if your control system has
only one sensor and is designed to switch or dim lights evenly across
the entire control zone.  "Virtual" sensors are usually placed in a
relatively dark spot in the controlled zone so that electric lighting
provides sufficient light in the entire zone on the lighting control not
just next to the window or directly under a skylight.  
 
Modeling two sensors would make sense if the amount of dimming or
fraction of switched lights were segregated by how close they were to
the window or skylight.  In that case you really have two separate
control zones.

Can day-lighting controls be considered for LEED certification under
"Energy & Atmosphere - Optimize Energy Performance"?  If so where should
the light sensor be located in the space?  Is there any energy code that
allows credit for day-lighting controls? The DOE2 program allows two
light sensors per space.  Supposing the two sensors are located 5 ft and
10 ft from the window.  Is the average daylight at these two points used
in determining the reduction in artificial lighting?

 

The DOE2 program expects zones to have 6 surfaces defined with X,Y,Z
coordinates and reflectance values for day-lighting analysis.  Ignoring
this produces warning messages but the results show a reduction in
artificial lighting energy.  For day-lighting analysis we only enter
into DOE2 the X,Y coordinates of the window origin relative to the wall
and also the wall and window dimensions.  Can we assume that the energy
savings results from the DOE2 program are on the safe side (the actual
energy saved is more) when we use the program without all the surfaces
and coordinates?

 

Are there any rules for day-lighting analysis for establishing energy
savings and for comparing the results from different studies?

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200401211129.AA2944859pd80000569204@gard.com>

We are modeling an office building under Equest 3.4/DOE 2.2. The outside air is preheated at 55F and is supplied to the main VAV systems via a dedicated system. The program seems to understand adequately the loads and sizes the systems correctly. 
 
During the year, we are getting a large amount of "load not met" hours in the internal zones, even though there are enough cfm to cool the total loads for the zones at the wanted supply temperature (these total loads for the zones and supply temperatures were obtained with an hourly report). The dedicated outside air system seems to work well when we are calculating manually the outside air mix with the return. We did try to oversize the cfm and cooling capacities, and the loads not met dissapear. But why oversizing the cfms when they were adequately sized according to the peak loads ?
 
My questions are : Do you understand what is happening & how does DOE calculates the load not met ?

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200401210844.AA4403171pd80000568988@gard.com>

Hello everybody, first of all, thank you for your support

I?m using eQUEST to simulate some buildings. I have a list with some equipment that the buildings have, for example: computer (3000 W), microwave (2200 W), fridge (2000 W), lights(2000 W), elevator (30000 W).....

I know that some of this loads contributes to space loads and some doesn?t, but I don?t know how much of the power really contributes for each load

Is there any web where I can know which part of this power enters the space depending on the kind of load?

How does eQUEST handle what you write in the fields? does it suppose that all this power contributes as a sensible heat load?

To sum up, what should I write in eQUEST to take into account my different kinds of loads?

Thanks

I am in the process of validating my Energy Plus model residence and need
experimental energy data for various locations throughout the US. I already
have looked at the 1997 RECs data but wanted more specific energy loads for
different cities.  For example, the heating/cooling loads and electric/gas
consumption of an actual residence in or near Atlanta, GA.  If anyone could
direct me to data done for typical residences for Atlanta, Phoenix, New York
City, Boston, Chicago, Denver, Washington DC, and San Fran, I would really
appreciate it.

GeoPraxis Announces the "Green Building StudioTM" Web Service Beta Program


Green Building StudioTM brings immediate building energy performance and
targeted equipment information for Architects and Designers using 3D-CAD at
the earliest conceptual design stage.



San Francisco, CA. -- Jan 14, 2004 -- GeoPraxis, an architectural,
engineering and construction software company, today announced the beta
release of Green Building Studio, the industry's first web service for
energy analysis.  Green Building Studio (GBS) streamlines the design of
green buildings, seamlessly linking architectural 3-D CAD building designs
with energy analysis.  GBS enables architects to immediately understand the
operational and energy implications of early design decisions using Green
Building XML (gbXML) based connectors for AutoDesk?s Architectural Desktop
and Graphisoft's ArchiCAD.  Architects and building designers can
participate in the GBS beta program for free, beginning January 14, 2004.
The GBS web-service is expected to be generally available in early 2004.

"GBS will significantly accelerate the incorporation of energy efficient and
sustainable technologies into new and retrofit buildings.  The GBS
web-service is based on R&D funded by the California Energy Commission and
leading Utilities," said John Kennedy, President and CTO of GeoPraxis.  "The
GBS beta program lets the design community access the GBS web service for
the first time.  User feedback will help fine tune the linkages between
Architectural Desktop and ArchiCAD.  The beta program will provide feedback
on technologies that for the first time link early design decisions with
precisely targeted, relevant equipment and vendor information. This
represents a huge breakthrough for the building design industry,
leapfrogging other information services.?

GBS web service drives significant time and cost out of building design and
lifecycle management processes.  Major benefits include:

?        It's Free, and saves thousands of dollars in advanced Green
Building analyses.

      ?        Reduced design costs, allowing more design options to be
explored within budget.

      ?        Compression of early design time, speeding project time to
completion.

      ?        Acceleration of Green Building ?LEED? Compliance Analysis.

      ?         Identify relevant products necessary for early building
designs decisions.

GBS automatically generates geometrically accurate, detailed input files for
major energy simulation programs.  GBS currently uses the DOE-2.2 simulation
engine and will provide geometrically accurate input files for EnergyPlus
simulation software.

To participate in the beta, you can sign up over the web at
http://www.greenbuildingstudio.com.  Participation in the beta program is
free of charge.  A simple beta test non-disclosure agreement is required.
Participants selected will be notified by GeoPraxis and are required to
provide feedback to the developers.  The beta program will run from early
January until March 30th, 2004.

About GeoPraxis
GeoPraxis, Inc., an architectural, engineering and construction software
company, is the industry leader in the development and implementation of
building energy analysis tools and web-based solutions.  With the release of

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200401131257.AA5715656pd80000558578@gard.com>

Dear colleagues

I?m using eQUEST to simulate the energy demand of some buildings for few months. Now I?m trying with a kind of shopping mall. In the results, it can be seen that the building needs cooling during all the year, even in winter. This makes sense to me because the ilumination load is huge but my question is:

1? Can eQUEST take advantage of the outside temperature (in winter) to save energy for cooling? I think this is called free-cooling but I don?t know it is an usual process or if it?s profitable, where can I find good information about free-cooling?  

and another question not related is

2? In eQUEST menu "building envelope constructions" I would like to know which are the exact meaning of the numbers in expressions like "metal frame, 2x6, 24 in. o.c." ?where can I found an image?

3? Does anybody know if it?s a good idea using the construction intelligent default of eQUEST for European buildings?  

Thank you all
