Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Invitation to Participate - Getting the Design Team to Use Energy Simulation from the Beginning
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200305312350.AA5030359pd80000321515@gard.com>

To ALL Interested Parties:

In February, a very interesting exchange of ideas occurred on BLDG-SIM at gard.com regarding the limited use of building energy simulation in the early design stages,  thoughts on why its limited,  and what might be done to increase the use of simulations in the early stage of design.  For those who did not see this exchange or would like to refresh their recollection of this, a compilation of these e-mails is found in the attached Word file.  

As the Chair of the Applications Subcommittee of ASHRAE TC 4.7- Energy Calculations, I would like to invite anyone and everyone interested in this subject to attend our next TC 4.7 Applications Subcommittee Meeting which will be held on July 1, 2003 from 3:30 to 5:00 p.m.. in Kansas City, Missouri, as part of the ASHRAE Summer Meeting.  (See the meeting program for the meeting location).


The subject to Getting the Design Team to Use Energy Simulation from the start of Design Process will be our main topic of discussion.  The purpose of this will be to continue this exchange of ideas and from there to create actionable items which will then be implemented.  

In some ways we've already started approaching this item.  At the Winter ASHRAE Meeting in Chicago, January 2003,  we presented a Seminar entitled "Getting Started with Building Simulation"  which was chaired by Chip Barnaby.  The four talks were an excellent presentation of "what is energy simulation", "why would I want to do it" and "what's available for doing it".  The third presentation - Allan Daly's presentation of "Using Building Simulation to Life-Cycle Cost Optimize HVAC System Design at UC Merced"  is a case study of project which actually did use simulation in the very early design stages.  Copies of the PowerPoints from each of these four presentations are available to download at the ASHRAE web site (www.ashrae.org ).  From the homepage, click on "ASHRAE Activities", then Technical Committees, then TC 4.7, then Programs.  Scroll down about a third of the page to previously presented programs.  The seminar was one of the best attended TC 4.7 presentations in recent history (standing room only) which shows that a lot of interest is there, we just need to do a good job of tapping into it.  

We welcome the opportunity to broaden the discussion and to broaden the participation.  ASHRAE, with its 55,000 world wide members,  Winter and Summer meetings with 2,500 to 3,500 technical program registrants, and over 160 local chapters,  can provide an effective venue for reaching the building design community.  Our successful "Getting Started with Building Simulation" seminar in Chicago and the ASHRAE Profession Development Session on Building Simulation which is now under development is only a start.  There is much, much more which could and should be done - and we welcome your ideas and involvement.

Some of our previous work identified the need for a good basic treatise on what building simulation is, what programs are available, who to contact, etc.  As we research that subject, we were pleased to learn that some excellent sources already existed and/or were nearing completion.  Let me appraise you of them so those who are interested can get a good overview of what is currently available in the building simulation (not just HVAC) arena.  The Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Technology Institute (the research arm of ARI) has available on its web site an report appropriately titled "State-of-the-Art Review, Whole-Building and Bulling Envelope Simulation and Design Tools"  It available at www.arti-21cr.org   There is also a companion report which focuses specifically on HVAC Component and System Simulation.   For specific cost and who to contact information on over 250 energy estimating programs, including most of the simulations DOE maintains a very comprehensive website at www.energytoolsdirectory.gov 

To help us plan a most productive session, I would appreciate your ideas on what you see as:
 
    1.    The most important or critical items that we need to discuss and try to reach consensus in our meeting at Kansas City.

    2.    The most important actions or programs our committee should be implementing in the short term (6 to 18 months)

    3.    The most important actions or programs our committee should get ASHRAE to implement in the longer term (1 to 5 years)  This could well include research projects.


For those who will be unable to join us in Kansas City, I invite you to share your ideas via the BLDG-SIM at gard.com list server.  I would ask that you post those ideas by June 20th as my travel schedule will make it difficult for me to print out material to distribute at the Kansas City meeting after that date.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] (Near) Real-Time Weather Data Archive now available
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200305301550.AA5050875pd80000320927@gard.com>

DOE is pleased to announce that a weather data archive with very recent
data (near real-time) for more than 1600 locations in the US and another
2500 locations around the world is now available on the web:

http://www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energy_tools/cfm/weather_request.cfm

(Or through the real-time weather data link on the right hand side of the
EnergyPlus web site:  www.energyplus.gov)

Background

In 1998, the Gas Technology Institute (formerly the Gas Research Institute)
created a real-time (very recent data) weather data archive for 245
locations in the United States.  After the original funding ended in 1999,
GTI was no longer able to maintain the weather data archive.

In 2001, DOE began investigating ways to restart and extend the database to
other locations in the US and throughout the world.  In 2002, the National
Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) began collecting hourly data for DOE as
it was reported the same day from the US National Weather Service (NWS) ftp
site for more than 4100 locations throughout the world.  This new
'real-time' weather data archive was developed by, and is hosted and
maintained by NREL.   Most locations have data which begins in early 2002.

GTI and its subcontractors, Mason-Grant Company and Rocket  Science Inc,
graciously agreed to donate the existing data archive and allowed DOE to
incorporate that data into the new database. The 245 US locations
originally in the GTI data archive often have data from 1998 through today.
But there are often significant gaps in the data.

Data Available

Because of network interruptions or missing data on the NWS ftp site, the
weather data archive does have gaps of hours to days.  If missing data is
less than 48 hours in length, the web site can interpolate the data for the
user. (Currently only wet bulb and dry bulb temperatures are interpolated.)
When data are missing, the data are broken into separate files.

The following data are available:

1. Local Date and Time, MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM
2. Greenwich Mean Time, MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM
3. Dry Bulb Temperature, tenths of degree Celsius
4. Wet Bulb Temperature, tenths of degree Celsius
5. Wind Direction, degrees (0? = North)
6. Wind Speed, tenths of meters per second
7. Wind Gusts, tenths of meters per second
8. Wind Variability Range, degrees
9. Altimeter, hundreds of pascals
10. Visibility, tenths of kilometers
11. Weather Description, MI, BC, PR, TS, BL, SH, DR, F
12. Weather Precipitation, DZ, RA, SN, SG, IC, PL, GR, GS, UP
13. Weather Observation, BR, FG, FU, VA, SA, HZ, PY, DU
14. Weather Other, SQ, SS, DS, PO, FC
15. Cloud Cover Level 1, identifier, height in hundreds of feet
16. Cloud Cover Level 2, identifier, height in hundreds of feet
17. Cloud Cover Level 3, identifier, height in hundreds of feet
18. Sea Level Pressure, hundreds of pascals

NOTE--There are NO SOLAR DATA reported through the NWS ftp site.

Users can request any amount of data--from a single day to the entire
available period of record (1998-May 2003 for the 245 US locations,
2002-May 2003 for most locations).  Data are usually available within a
week or so after they are reported on the NWS ftp site and updated
continually (It takes a long time to process 4100 locations!).  Data are
emailed directly to the user, usually within minutes.

Output formats include comma-separated values (CSV) and IWEC (ASHRAE's
International Weather for Energy Calculations).  Both are documented in the
manual available on the web site.

We hope that you find the archive useful and we welcome feedback!

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200305280835.AA3534234pd80000319280@gard.com>

It appears it is required to input baseboard capacity in Btu/hour when
baseboard heating in a specific zone is desired.  This would require an
estimation of envelope heat loss.  Does EQUEST distribute the baseboard
capacity equally along the perimeter wall surfaces?

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] DOE2.1E Chiller performance
References: <MDAEMON-F200305151500.AA0012812pd80000455188@gard.com>
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200305161210.AA1007437pd80000311943@gard.com>

The old default DOE2 centrifugal chiller curves, evaluated directly for 
leaving CHW Ts of 42 & 38 and completely independently of any other 
inputs, show a consistent increase in chiller kW/ton of 11% for a range 
of normal CW temperatures. The newer DOE2.2 curves use "lift"(CW-CHW) 
and part load fraction in addition to a new CHW & CW, so I can't 
evaluate the default curves as directly. There are other adjustments for 
performance under varying, or off-rated, primary flow and temperature 
that must be accounted for.

Results from TRACE probably reflect Trane chiller performance, which 
tends to be less sensitive to chiller "lift," and more suited for these 
lower temperature applications.

So even preliminary analysis can be biased by either generic or 
manufacturer-specific curves, and the limitations of the simulation. 
Resets of CHW, CW, and pressure along with coil performance, etc, 
interact to affect the "optimum" system. Lowest life-cycle cost SYSTEMS 
using different manufacturers' chillers may be very different.

I may not have used the DOE2.1E correctly because results showed the chiller LWT was always the default value of 44F.  The test building was a single zone per floor, 70% single glass, with multiple floors to produce over 6000 tons.  The DOE2 program was run with SOM office building template defaults.  The TRACE program was run twice, with all TRACE defaults for an office building, VAV system and water-cooled centrifugal chillers, first with CHW temp range of 38 to 56 and next with 42 to 56.  In the first case the program gave warning messages for LWT < 40 and CHW-DT > 15.

>The energy usage of a chiller operating from 38 to 56 was higher, but not significantly higher (relative to potential savings in the pump operating, heat transfer equipment and piping costs) than 42 to 56.  This might be because of limitations in the energy program algorithms, and actual physical tests with chillers might produce different results. 	Cooling coil sizes in terms of fins, rows, etc are going to be affected.  I did not check this out using cooling coil selection programs.  I did not check or compare the results of the air-side system equipment performance.

I would also be interested in comments from Trane regarding the results from TRACE. Was the program used incorrectly?

There is little difference in the energy consumed by the chillers for CHW temp range of 38F to 56F and 44F to 56F particularly in the large tonnage range.  This is also indicated in chiller performance data catalogs.  There is a big difference in pumping and piping costs.

As a rough rule-of-thumb, you can expect about a 1%-1.5% change in
efficiency for every degree change in chilled-water supply temperature.

This is for a "pre-conceptual?" phase of a project and the only interest
here at the moment is whether there is difference in chiller energy
consumption.  As the project progresses we will be looking at other issues.
I cannot give numbers from this rough "pre-analysis?" of the project because
this is a confidential internal matter.  You could check out chiller and
building component energy use with the various energy programs available.
Each chiller size has to be at least 1000 tons and the building could be
anything.  I only brought up this issue on BLDG-SIM because I think there
might be a bug in the DOE2.1E program.

Varkie,

The percentage higher energy consumption at different leaving water
temperatures is more useful than, " was higher, but not significantly higher
(relative to potential savings in the pump operating, heat transfer
equipment and piping costs)".  How much higher was the energy consumption in
percentage?

When you are talking about "heat transfer equipment" above are you talking
about coils or something else?  If you are talking about coils - the next
sentence says you haven't investigated this.

How much did the coil loads change (%) from reducing the leaving water
temperature?
How much did chiller efficiency change (%) from reducing the leaving water
temperature?
How much did pumping energy change (%) from reducing leaving water
temperature?
Was piping diameter resized?

Thanks,

Jon McHugh

This is in response to comments and questions that I received.

This was a preliminary attempt using DOE2.1E to find out large tonnage
chiller energy usage at decreasing LWTs and a fixed EWT to reduce the
CHW-flow.  I may not have used the DOE2.1E correctly because results showed
the chiller LWT was always the default value of 44F.  The test building was
a single zone per floor, 70% single glass, with multiple floors to produce
over 6000 tons.  The DOE2 program was run with SOM office building template
defaults.  The TRACE program was run twice, with all TRACE defaults for an
office building, VAV system and water-cooled centrifugal chillers, first
with CHW temp range of 38 to 56 and next with 42 to 56.  In the first case
the program gave warning messages for LWT < 40 and CHW-DT > 15.

The energy usage of a chiller operating from 38 to 56 was higher, but not
significantly higher (relative to potential savings in the pump operating,
heat transfer equipment and piping costs) than 42 to 56.  This might be
because of limitations in the energy program algorithms, and actual physical
tests with chillers might produce different results. Cooling coil sizes in
terms of fins, rows, etc are going to be affected.  I did not check this out
using cooling coil selection programs.  I did not check or compare the
results of the air-side system equipment performance.

What would be the results from other energy programs such EnergyPlus, HAP
and eQUEST?  I would be particularly interested in the results from HAP.  We
do not have this program in this office.  I would also be interested in
comments from Trane regarding the results from TRACE. Was the program used
incorrectly?

To those who responded to this inquiry:

We tested the two conditions with TRACE-700.  There is little difference in
the energy consumed by the chillers for CHW temp range of 38F to 56F and 44F
to 56F particularly in the large tonnage range.  This is also indicated in
chiller performance data catalogs.  There is a big difference in pumping and
piping costs.

---------------------------------------

We are trying to compare the performance of a 2000 ton chiller operating at
(1) 42 F LWT and (2) 38 F LWT.  The chiller EWT is 56 in both cases.  The
tower temp range is 85 F to 100 F.  We want to know how the chiller COP
varies under these conditions.

The hourly output for the design day from DOE2.1E shows chiller LWT of 44 F
(DOE2 default) no matter what the input.  Here is the input and output for
the option with 38 F Chiller LWT.  Can the Chiller LWT be changed from the
default value of 44 F ?  How do I check that the CHW EWT & LWT temps are
being maintained? Is the input below correct to model the conditions
described?

Varkie,

The percentage higher energy consumption at different leaving water temperatures is more useful than, " was higher, but not significantly higher (relative to potential savings in the pump operating, heat transfer equipment and piping costs)".  How much higher was the energy consumption in percentage?

When you are talking about "heat transfer equipment" above are you talking about coils or something else?  If you are talking about coils - the next sentence says you haven't investigated this.

How much did the coil loads change (%) from reducing the leaving water temperature?
How much did chiller efficiency change (%) from reducing the leaving water temperature?
How much did pumping energy change (%) from reducing leaving water temperature?
Was piping diameter resized?

Thanks,

Jon McHugh

This is in response to comments and questions that I received.

This was a preliminary attempt using DOE2.1E to find out large tonnage chiller energy usage at decreasing LWTs and a fixed EWT to reduce the CHW-flow.  I may not have used the DOE2.1E correctly because results showed the chiller LWT was always the default value of 44F.  The test building was a single zone per floor, 70% single glass, with multiple floors to produce over 6000 tons.  The DOE2 program was run with SOM office building template defaults.  The TRACE program was run twice, with all TRACE defaults for an office building, VAV system and water-cooled centrifugal chillers, first with CHW temp range of 38 to 56 and next with 42 to 56.  In the first case the program gave warning messages for LWT < 40 and CHW-DT > 15.  

The energy usage of a chiller operating from 38 to 56 was higher, but not significantly higher (relative to potential savings in the pump operating, heat transfer equipment and piping costs) than 42 to 56.  This might be because of limitations in the energy program algorithms, and actual physical tests with chillers might produce different results. 	Cooling coil sizes in terms of fins, rows, etc are going to be affected.  I did not check this out using cooling coil selection programs.  I did not check or compare the results of the air-side system equipment performance.

What would be the results from other energy programs such EnergyPlus, HAP and eQUEST?  I would be particularly interested in the results from HAP.  We do not have this program in this office.  I would also be interested in comments from Trane regarding the results from TRACE. Was the program used incorrectly?

To those who responded to this inquiry:

We tested the two conditions with TRACE-700.  There is little difference in the energy consumed by the chillers for CHW temp range of 38F to 56F and 44F to 56F particularly in the large tonnage range.  This is also indicated in chiller performance data catalogs.  There is a big difference in pumping and piping costs.

We are trying to compare the performance of a 2000 ton chiller operating at (1) 42 F LWT and (2) 38 F LWT.  The chiller EWT is 56 in both cases.  The tower temp range is 85 F to 100 F.  We want to know how the chiller COP varies under these conditions.  

The hourly output for the design day from DOE2.1E shows chiller LWT of 44 F (DOE2 default) no matter what the input.  Here is the input and output for the option with 38 F Chiller LWT.  Can the Chiller LWT be changed from the default value of 44 F ?  How do I check that the CHW EWT & LWT temps are being maintained? Is the input below correct to model the conditions described?

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200305150849.AA492862pd80000310856@gard.com>

To those who responded to this inquiry:

We tested the two conditions with TRACE-700.  There is little difference in the energy consumed by the chillers for CHW temp range of 38F to 56F and 44F to 56F particularly in the large tonnage range.  This is also indicated in chiller performance data catalogs.  There is a big difference in pumping and piping costs.

Common problem. You are using a recent version of DOE2 based on an 
implementation by Jeff Hirsch, but using documentation and keywords from 
older versions. All CHW & HW characteristics are now declared in Systems 
Plant Assignment, not Plant Plant Parameters, CW stuff is still in PLANT.

Correct documentation is available from DOE2.com. The v110 bdl 
supplement or something like that.

However, for plant analysis at this level of detail, I would highly 
recommend DOE2.2, instead of DOE2.1.

Common problem. You are using a recent version of DOE2 based on an 
implementation by Jeff Hirsch, but using documentation and keywords from 
older versions. All CHW & HW characteristics are now declared in Systems 
Plant Assignment, not Plant Plant Parameters, CW stuff is still in PLANT.

Correct documentation is available from DOE2.com. The v110 bdl 
supplement or something like that.

However, for plant analysis at this level of detail, I would highly 
recommend DOE2.2, instead of DOE2.1.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200305141043.AA4350734pd80000310219@gard.com>

We are trying to compare the performance of a 2000 ton chiller operating at (1) 42 F LWT and (2) 38 F LWT.  The chiller EWT is 56 in both cases.  The tower temp range is 85 F to 100 F.  We want to know how the chiller COP varies under these conditions.  

The hourly output for the design day from DOE2.1E shows chiller LWT of 44 F (DOE2 default) no matter what the input.  Here is the input and output for the option with 38 F Chiller LWT.  Can the Chiller LWT be changed from the default value of 44 F ?  How do I check that the CHW EWT & LWT temps are being maintained? Is the input below correct to model the conditions described?

Dear colleagues,

I could?t find in the EnergyPlus documentation the answer to my question
...so i would like to put it again  ... Any one knows if it?s possible
in EnergyPlus to simulate solar collectors? Does anyone knows something
about it ? I think it's not possible, but i would like to be sure about
it ...

Thanks for your help,

Miguel,

There is a trombe wall example in the example files with included with
EnergyPlus.  I haven't run it, but it seems like that might be something to
pick apart and use to your purposes.

The path should be:
  EnergyPlus\ExampleFiles\Misc\PassiveTrombeWall.idf
There is also an active trombe wall stored under:
    EnergyPlus\ExampleFiles\Misc\ActiveTrombeWall.idf

I hope this helps.

Louis

Dear colleagues,

Fisrt of all thanks for those that responded me about trombe walls
aspects.
Now i have another question ... Any one knows if it?s possible in
EnergyPlus to simulate sun collectors and sunspaces. I presume that it
should be possible to construct a normal space that would be, in real, a
sunspace, but i'm not sure ... Does anyone knows something about it ?

A recent question about ventilated facades...

Esp-r has been used to represent various ventilated facades
and buffer spaces (in research studies and in the 
context of consulting projects). An experienced user
can adapt the resolution of the model form, composition, 
control actions and flow regimes as required. 

Such studies might require a bit of care, but are
well suppored by the tight coupling of the 
building and network flow and/or CFD domains.

For more information about ESP-r see the web page

Dear Miguel Jesus,

The standard TRNSYS library includes a Trombe Wall model (Type 36). A quick
web search will give you many references on modeling Trombe Walls in TRNSYS.

It is also easy to create or modify a TRNSYS component, in case Type 36
would not be suited to your partcular case. 

Regards,

Micha?l Kummert

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200305071602.AA022115pd80000305127@gard.com>

Hi, I'm running a single zone building using system
SZRH. But I can't seem to specify an outside air ratio
below 10%. When I do, the report SV-A lists the
correct OA at the zone level, but 10% at the system
level. This is backed up in hourly reports, and by the
fact my results don't change. It doesn't seem to
matter whether there is an economizer or not, or
whether I specify the OA at the zone or at the system.
Does anybody know if this is a bug in Doe2, or what
the answer might be? I'm using Doe2.1e, v.133.

Thanks

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200305070246.AA4658468pd80000304544@gard.com>

Announcing the first ESP-r developers conference and workshop

August 18-21 2003 University of Strathclyde, Glasgow Scotland 

Since switching to the GPL distribution and development approach for
ESP-r there have been a growing number of individuals and groups who
have downloaded the distribution and who are making use of it in their
work, businesses and classrooms. With this expanding user community
comes an increasing demand to evolve the system.

We want current and potential developers from all over the world to come
together for a conference and workshop to expand their skills and focus 
on the evolution of ESP-r. This meeting follows on from the IBPSA 
conference in Eindhoven and we hope that many of the delegates will 
be able to attend. 

An initial schedule of events is listed below and updates to the 
venue and speakers and workshop sessions will be posted to the
ESRU web site <http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk>.

Monday 18 August: Conference on Current and Future Developments of ESP-r
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The aim of this day is to have presentations from researchers
who are actively developing ESP-r, and to have a session on 
future directions and requirements.

Preliminary presentations scheduled are: 
* Brief development history of ESP-r - Joe Clarke (ESRU)
* Overview of current development efforts and impact of GPL - Jon Hand
(ESRU) 
* Building other tools from ESP-r - Phylroy Lopez (NRCan)
* Acoustics and life-cycle assessments as new domains - Stephane
Citherlet (EIVD)
* ESP-r & Radiance co-operative working - Iain MacDonald (SESG)
* Systems/electrical simulation (code/components/structures) - Nick
Kelly (ESRU)
* Overview of current mechanisms for generating and testing
  code/models/databases/documentation for inclusion in the
  archive and discussion on how this might evolve for a
  larger development community 
* Brainstorming on what ESP-r might become
* Brainstorming on community support for ESP-r
* Conference summary

Tuesday 19 August: Basic course on ESP-r development
----------------------------------------------------
The aim of this day is to give participants an overview of 
the ESP-r structure, procedures and tools for code development,
validation and integration of developments into the ESP-r distribution.

Topics include:
* ESP-r data model
* Structure of the code distribution including libraries
* Code development guide
* Compiling and creating a development workspace
* Exercises on compiling and modifying source code
* Exercises on code checking and development tools

Wednesday 20 August: Advanced topics for developers
---------------------------------------------------
The aim of this day is to look at theory and implementation
of key parts of the ESP-r system.

Topics include:
* The solvers (building/flow/CFD)
* Inter-domain communication
* Thermophysical sub-systems
* Data exchange with other software agents
* Working with other software agents
* Solar process - an exploration of code and data structures
* Adding functionality to ESP-r and extending the data model
* Workshop summary

Thursday 21 August: Individual projects
--------------------------------------
The aim of this day for those wishing to stay is to discuss
in detail current and future developments of participants.

It will start with a session planning ongoing and future
developments, after which there will be detailed discussions
on specific developments of interest to participants

------------------------------------------------------------
Each day will run from 9:00 to 17:00. There will be a 
dinner on Tuesday evening.

Some sessions will require access to a computer capable of running
ESP-r as well as compiling source code. We encourage you to
bring along a laptop with a current ESP-r distribution and 
development tools already installed and power adaptors suitable for 
plugging into standard UK sockets. Note: ESP-r can be compiled
and run on a Windows only machine; however, that platform is
considered a BETA and Linux/Unix is the preferred setup for
the workshop sessions.

To register your interest in the conference please tick the 
boxes below and email back to Jon Hand (jon at esru.strath.ac.uk).
Remember to check the ESRU web pages for the latest news.

The conference and workshops fee (including Tuesday dinner) is 150
Pounds.
Workshops only fee is 100 Pounds and conference-only fee is 75 Pounds.

Details of accommodation will be listed on the ESRU web page.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] When is building energy simulation cost justified
In-Reply-To: <MDAEMON-F200305061234.AA3456437pd80000445056@gard.com>

Jason,

I definitely believe that it makes sense to do energy simulation on most
commercial and industrial buildings, and sometimes, residential.  On the
other hand, I do not have a lot of faith in codes to accomplish this.  I
have believed for a long time that economics will justify the simulations.
You just have to show the client the economics.  My recent experience on a
few projects where energy codes were involved indicates that there is more
interest in checking off the code compliance than in saving energy.  I was
called in after most decisions were made, just to demonstrate code
compliance.

That said, I believe there are more important things than size.  A small,
air conditioned office building will use more energy than a large, heated
only warehouse.  Expected annual energy costs for the building would be one
avenue.  In earlier days (1970s and 1980s), energy budgets were a popular
method that I still like better than the proscriptive approach of 90.1 and
IECC.  Many of the proscriptive requirements are just plain wrong for many
buildings.

In the long run, I still believe that energy code money should be spent on
education rather than rules.  When we teach an owner that he can get a 30%
ROI on his energy conservation investment, he will be much more interested
than when he is required to meet specific requirements, many of which are
wrong for his building.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] When is building energy simulation cost justified


As an advocate of the use of building energy simulation
modeling, I have often thought that requiring the use of
these tools for buildings that comply with energy codes,
like IECC and ASHRAE 90.1, would make sense for certain
building types and sizes.  Building simulation often seems
to result in significant energy cost savings compared to
the cost of the modeling itself.

In the experience of those on the BLDG-SIM mailing list,
under what conditions is the cost of performing the
modeling cost justified given the results?  Is it possible
to have a simple building size threshold, say 100,000
square feet (about 10,000 square meters), that almost
always applied to when building energy simulation modeling
is cost justified?

Ultimately, I would like to submit change proposals to the
major energy code organizations that include such a
requirement but I need substantiation. Any suggestions or
insights are welcome.

Not all simulation software or code compliance tools require extensive installation or expertise. In fact some of these tools help designers in selecting building products ( which they have to do anyway)  while  they make code calculations. We are developing such software to comply with the IECC code, you may try it at;
http://filebox.vt.edu/users/habaza/abacode/index.html
Ultimately, this tool will be similar to any building database such as sweet catalogue web site, but at the same time provides code compliance.

In DOE-2.2, you can easily access hourly electrical data via the hourly-report for the ELEC-METER(s).

In the more recent 2.2 releases, you can directly simulate PV systems, including sellback.  However, there may be a problem if you use the Sandia/King formulation, as apparently the number of coefficients have increased since the algorithm was inplemented.  

Does anyone have a concise document summarizing the current usage of coefficients in the Sandia/King photovoltaic algorithm?

  Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Clarification: Hourly electrical utility report


  I have a number of questions regarding what I was looking for in my earlier email.  I thought I should clarify why I am asking for advice:  I actually need hourly reports to verify the metered building electrical energy versus the amount of electrical energy generated by building mounted photovoltaics.  I need to determine what percentage of the yield from the PV system is in excess of the total building load at any point during the year.  In my building, if the yield is greater than the load, then corresponding amount of electricity in kWh will be "net-metered" or reverse metered to the grid.  Since we will be developing an hour-by -hour model of the PV yield, I need a whole building energy end use-report to match.  The ultimate goal will be to predict the amount of energy sold back to the utility.  I know that I have total operating hours and demand kW in other reports.  In summary, that's why I need an hour-by-hour report.

  Thanks again,

It seems to me that if you don't assign any loads to electrical meters 
other than Electric Meter #1, the default, then you can get your total 
demand and kWh from VARIABLE-TYPE = END-USE, 23.

Note that the hourly report 22 is both demand and kWh.  Sum the values for 
a day or month or year to get total kWh.
