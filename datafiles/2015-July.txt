Message-ID: <CAM04Qhc-mfU8B5ekVCaN3VEcheDBBb31-m2VKrOrcDN4cDxb8w@mail.gmail.com>

What is in your opinion the baseline for the following building:

Floor area:12,000 sqm (130,000 sqft)
Floors: 5 above grade, mostly conditioned. 5 underground parking, mostly
unconditioned apart from some conditioned spaces in the first below grade
floor.

Predominant Use: Office (85% of sqft),
Secondary use: bank in PB and below grade; Kitchen, below grade; control
security room, below grade.

I'm in between baseline 6 or 8. If conditioned spaces below grade fall
under exceptions to G3.1.1 b. then can I consider for the baseline that the
predominant building has 5 floors instead of 6?

Thanks in advance.

Santiago.

In my opinion the *system type 8* would be applicable. As the *total
conditioned area *is not explicitly mentioned so i presume it is more than
150,000 sqft (above grade floor+basement floor areas).

Here are couple of reason which i could think of:


i) per G3.1.1,  HVAC systems in the baseline building design shall be based
on usage, number of floors, conditioned floor area, and heating source as
specified in Table G3.1.1A and shall conform with the system descriptions
in Table G3.1.1B.

ii) per Table G3.1.1A, system 8 would be applicable if either of the
condition is met number of floors OR conditioned area OR both

iii) exception G3.1.1a would be applicable once you are decided with
the *predominant
system type* based on number of floors or conditioned area OR both per
section G3.1.1. I strongly feel that exceptions are applicable only when
the modeling scenario can not be addressed by the main sections which in
your case is G3.1.1.

Hope this helps!

I would also go with 8, for simplicity.  You pretty clearly have 6 levels
with conditioned spaces.



Even if you do go through the effort to declare each underground level
conditioned space as subject to G3.1.1 exceptions, that doesn?t reduce the
quantity of floors with conditioned spaces for the whole project.



That said, this is one of those situations where I?d subjectively agree
it?s within the realm of reasonable interpretation to pursue the direction
you?ve described with System type 6.  I might be more motivated to make
that case if packaged DX systems per-floor are a closer approximation to
the actual design equipment than a chiller plant.  I suspect it may
ultimately be more effort than it?s worth however.

I agree with both of you. I guess my argument was that since these below
grade conditioned spaces would be served by separate HVAC system anyway,
then  they match the intention of the G.3.1.1.b. But I agree this is grey
area.
Good news is, this is early energy modelling to drive design, so it is
Baseline definition that will determine proposed HVAC system. First
proposal was an air cooled VRF system,  which in my experience against
baseline 8, will have difficulties (or be costly) achieving the substantial
targeted savings (34% again 90.1-2007 App. G). This would be more
achievable against a system 6.

Anyway, thanks for the insights!

Santiago.

West Coast USA training registration underway.


Don't miss this opportunity to be trained in the easiest to use/learn, most powerful building energy performance tool available.


DesignBuilder is an elegant, seamless integration of building energy performance tools encompassing the totality of building energy use, including whole building energy simulation, daylighting and internal/external CFD (computational fluid dynamics).

Suitable for both residential and commercial applications, DesignBuilder was the first graphical user interface (GUI) to EnergyPlus, the 'gold standard' for whole building energy simulation. With more than ten years of development invested, DesignBuilder is the building energy performance tool of choice for today's architects and engineers.

Developed to simplify the process of building simulation, DesignBuilder allows you to rapidly compare the function and performance of building designs and deliver early stage thru final results on time and on budget. Unlike other products that generate results that are broad and indefinite, or do not address daylighting or airflow and 3-D temperature distribution data in and around buildings, DesignBuilder provides a total solution with data results you can have complete confidence in.

The training will be run using version 4 of DesignBuilder and will cover many of the new and enhanced features such as the new geometric modeler with enhanced block geometry editing, the ability to mirror blocks, add individual surfaces, and produce cut-away/section visualizations. Version 4 can produce ASHRAE 90.1 standards compliant baseline models required of various certification and credit programs including LEED, IRS, etc.

The training is suitable for new and experienced users alike. It is fully modular so that people can attend just one or any number of the days.

The course is organized so that architects could attend only the first 2-3 days and the last 2 days are specific to engineers. The focus on day 3 is low energy and passive design modelling and it would therefore be valuable for both architects and engineers.

Locations & Dates

*	San Francisco, California; September 21-25, 2015

Discounts are available for students/researchers/faculty and multiple company attendees booking 4 or more days.

Space is limited so we encourage early registration.

Training offered in Dubai, UAE at British University in Dubai, October 19-23, 2015.


Don't miss this opportunity to be trained in the easiest to use/learn, most powerful building energy performance tool available.


DesignBuilder is an elegant, seamless integration of building energy performance tools encompassing the totality of building energy use, including whole building energy simulation, daylighting and internal/external CFD (computational fluid dynamics).

Suitable for both residential and commercial applications, DesignBuilder was the first graphical user interface (GUI) to EnergyPlus, the 'gold standard' for whole building energy simulation. With more than ten years of development invested, DesignBuilder is the building energy performance tool of choice for today's architects and engineers.

Developed to simplify the process of building simulation, DesignBuilder allows you to rapidly compare the function and performance of building designs and deliver early stage thru final results on time and on budget. Unlike other products that generate results that are broad and indefinite, or do not address daylighting or airflow and 3-D temperature distribution data in and around buildings, DesignBuilder provides a total solution with data results you can have complete confidence in.

The training is suitable for new and experienced users alike. It is fully modular so that people can attend just one or any number of the days. The course is organized so that architects could attend only the first 2-3 days and the last 2 days are specific to engineers. The focus on day 3 is low energy and passive design modelling and it would therefore be valuable for both architects and engineers.

Space is limited so we encourage early registration.

 <http://energymodeling.net/designbuilder-energyplus-training> Additional course information and registration.

Are you designing and modeling net zero buildings? What are you waiting for? DesignBuilder is the best software on the market today for that job!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Release date of addenda supplement to 90.1 2013
Message-ID: <096601d0ba61$fd49ca50$f7dd5ef0$@karpmanconsulting.net>

Does anyone know the release date of the supplement to 90.1 2013, and
whether addendum bm will be included in it? 

 

I searched on-line for a version of addendum bm that was posted for public
review, but had no luck. I know that review is closed and that the final
version would have some differences, but was hoping that the draft would
linger. Does anyone happen to have it and is willing to share? 

 

Thanks,

 

Maria

Director Energy Code Compliance

Description:

For our July meeting, we will have members of the NYC Department of Buildings Technical Affairs Unit present on energy modeling for compliance with the commercial chapter of the 2014 New York City Energy Code.

The presentation will cover the following:

*                     What triggers the performance compliance path in the commercial chapter?

*                     Is an energy model only required for enclosure compliance, should mechanical/lighting designers still submit COMcheck reports?  Or does the energy model cover all three?

*                     What are the options within performance path (i.e., ASHRAE 2010 v. NYC ECC)?

*                     If following ASHRAE 90.1-2010, do you have to model per Ch. 11 ECB and Normative App. G?

*                     What does Appendix A of 2014 NYC ECC require?

*                     What supporting documentation is required?  What should be included on drawings (EN sheets)?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Relief Fan in Baseline Fan Power
Message-ID: <004401d0bcc6$3a25b2c0$ae711840$@ncat.org>

Hello - I have a question about relief fans in a LEED baseline eQuest model.
I'm using the baseline fan power spreadsheet to calculate kW/cfm.  If a
system has both a supply and a return fan then the accepted method splits
the supply fan power between the two fans.  However, if the system has a
supply fan and a relief fan that, in theory anyway, comes on only during
economizer cooling, I don't think that splitting up the supply fan power
between the supply and relief fans makes sense.  The relief fan will only
run part of the year, especially in climate zone 6b.  So it won't be a good
representation of the fan energy and ends penalizing the proposed model
energy savings.  Does anyone have any experience with this in regards to
what the LEED reviewers might accept?

 

Thanks!

 

v.

Message-ID: <CAFydjmSbOWy0wsJbzd0fGwiw5iCiEoKY6+tuayyL=73k0pcaVQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Bldg-Sim community,
Many of you are aware that the ASHRAE Energy Modeling Conference in the
Fall is promoting a "Low Down Showdown
<https://www.ashrae.org/membership--conferences/conferences/ashrae-conferences/lowdown-showdown>",
in which modeling teams are challenged to design a Net Zero building, then
present the results during the conference.
The eQuest team currently lacks a "Coach", which for other teams is
 someone designated by the software vendor.  We (the conference Steering
Committee) are hoping to find someone who will volunteer to Coach that team
as it uses EQuest to help design the modeling challenge building.
If you think you might be able to do so, please contact me to discuss it.

Training in Boston, MA, August 3-7, 2015


Don't miss this opportunity to be trained in the easiest to use/learn, most powerful building energy performance tool available.


DesignBuilder is an elegant, seamless integration of building energy performance tools encompassing the totality of building energy use, including whole building energy simulation, daylighting and internal/external CFD (computational fluid dynamics).

Suitable for both residential and commercial applications, DesignBuilder was the first graphical user interface (GUI) to EnergyPlus, the 'gold standard' for whole building energy simulation. With more than ten years of development invested, DesignBuilder is the building energy performance tool of choice for today's architects and engineers.

Developed to simplify the process of building simulation, DesignBuilder allows you to rapidly compare the function and performance of building designs and deliver early stage thru final results on time and on budget. Unlike other products that generate results that are broad and indefinite, or do not address daylighting or airflow and 3-D temperature distribution data in and around buildings, DesignBuilder provides a total solution with data results you can have complete confidence in.

The training is suitable for new and experienced users alike. It is fully modular so that people can attend just one or any number of the days. The course is organized so that architects could attend only the first 2-3 days and the last 2 days are specific to engineers. The focus on day 3 is low energy and passive design modelling and it would therefore be valuable for both architects and engineers.

Space is limited so we encourage early registration.

 <http://designbuilderusa.com/training/designbuilder-simulation-training-days> Additional course information and registration.

Are you designing and modeling net zero buildings? What are you waiting for? DesignBuilder is the best software on the market today for that job!

LBNL released the Modelica Buildings library 2.1.0, which is fully
compatible with version 2.0.0.

Version 2.1.0 adds the package Buildings.Fluid.FMI that provides containers
for exporting thermofluid flow components as FMUs. It also updates the
temperature sensor to optionally simulate heat losses, and it contains bug
fixes for the trace substance sensor if used without flow reversal.

Improvements have been made to various models to reduce the simulation
time, and to Buildings.Examples.Tutorial.Boiler to simplify the control
implementation.

For a detailed list of changes, see
http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica/releases/v2.1.0/help/Buildings_UsersGuide_ReleaseNotes.html#Buildings.UsersGuide.ReleaseNotes.Version_2_1_0

Hi,

 

Does anyone know if EE Wizard for Arenas is still available online?  The
link doesn't seem to work anymore.  I also read somewhere that there was a
stand-alone (computer installed) version, I'm not sure if that is available?

 

I'm aware that RETScreen has a refrigeration module for pre-feasibility
analysis but I think EE Wizard has additional capabilities.

 

Thanks,
Aaron

Ok, so there's no substitute for doing weather data right.

However, in the absence of such data, could real-time pv yield be used as a
surrogate?

You can use anything you want as a surrogate, as long as you have some way
of proving it works. In this case, if you could somehow get real time PV
data for a set of sites that also had actual insolation and then looked at
your results, I think you could derive a typical relationship that wouldn't
lead you too far astray. The problem will come when there are passing
clouds and the PV system is "hunting" all the time trying to catch up with
the changing insolation. I bet you could find those and apply a bias
correction that could then be used in multiple sites with real time PV
data.

Description:
A macro-free, single zone Heat Pump Energy Savings Calculator (HePESC) workbook is currently under development by the Integrated Design Lab in Boise, Idaho. As part of the calculator vetting process, an in-depth loads analysis was done comparing the heat gain results with those from EnergyPlus and eQuest. Comparisons were made for lighting, plug loads, infiltration, glazing solar heat gain, zone temperature, and overall building loads. Through these comparisons, it is obvious the simulations use differing calculation methods which result in varying final outputs. This presentation will give a brief overview of the heat pump calculator project and progress, then further discuss the loads results from the simulation studies and possible next steps.

This is an intriguing idea (using PV output as a surrogate for 
irradiance), but there are a number of complications that need to be 
investigated:
1. PV efficiency degrades with temperature; therefore, you have to have 
some way to adjust the output by the temperature of the PV (not the air 
temperature)
2. you also need to adjust for the tilt and azimuth of the PV panels to 
derive the equivalent global horizontal radiation.
3. you also need to split the global horizontal into direct and diffuse 
radiation, which could be done using a number of direct/diffuse split 
models, which is what's done for 99% of the weather files anyway because 
I've yet to find any measured direct normal radiation outside of 
strictly research applications.

When I look at this list, all three could be done using a building 
energy simulation program,  provided that you know the absorptivity of 
the PV and its conversion efficiency as a function of temperature,  but 
at this point it's getting more hairy than calculating the solar 
radiation from standard weather station data or, beginning in Sept 2015 
for US locations, downloading the solar radiation from NREL.

I'm not being critical, and actually I am quite intrigued by this 
technique, and would be happy to help evaluate how well it works.

Another note I forgot to mention:  how easy is it to get the hourly 
output from the PV panels?  If the need for the solar radiation data is 
to evaluate actual building DSM, then the PV output data would have to 
have been collected at the same time as the utility billing data.

Yes, interesting idea and glad to see it discussed here.

This idea also occurred to us when evaluating PV systems on a number of 
buildings in Hawaii.  In that project, we were fortunate enough to have 
a solar monitoring site <http://www.nrel.gov/midc/nelha/> right down the 
street, and he had 15min and 1hour PV  energy generation for every panel 
(micro-invertors) on 15 different buildings, each oriented in the same 
direction.  However, some other issues, besides the one's Joe described, 
came to mind in trying to develop a model that linked the two:

  * In addition to temperature, PV panels energy production also
    degrades as the panels get dirty.  That seemed like the variable
    that is toughest to compensate for.
  * Data connection between the inverters to the cloud was pretty good,
    but we did find gaps a number of gaps; sometimes for up to a month
    or two.

Still yes, an interesting idea, and sounds like a good research project...

Hi Santiago,

One benefit might be the ability to do the dehumidification remotely via
the DOAS system. This could alleviate the maintenance of drip trays /
condensate drains from your VRF fan coil units. You might also be able to
down-spec the VRF fan coils that you are using as well (possibly reducing
size).

Another benefit would be that it might be cheaper to do a higher
performance style of heat recovery centrally that could help reduce heating
energy in particular.

So there are 2 reasons!

cheers,

Andrew

Message-ID: <BA4189EBB07D1C43AACAAC83BAD7F52F4EAA5A794E@DLB-EXMBX03.dlbassociates.com>

Dear Bldg-Sim list,

We are trying to determine the efficiency of an old gas-fired steam boiler that we plan to replace with a high-efficiency hot water boiler. We asked a company that tunes burners to take two combustion efficiency measurements - one before tuning and one after. Unfortunately the burner was operating so poorly prior to tuning that it messed up the combustion efficiency analyzer; it gave no readings and our opportunity to obtain a pre-implementation combustion efficiency value was lost. We do know that the burner was being starved of combustion air, but we aren't sure by how much, or how low the efficiency of a gas-fired boiler can drop before its safeties shut it off.

If anyone has successfully measured the efficiency of an operating boiler that is starved of combustion air, and is willing to share this efficiency, I would be quite grateful. I am looking your 'worst of the worst' efficiency measurements. The rest of our energy model Is nicely aligned with facility usage, but we would need to drop the overall efficiency of this boiler to less than 50% to align with utility data, and even this value assumes that we are generous in terms of modeling warm winter temperature setpoints, high infiltration rates, etc.

For reference the steam boiler we looked at is about 45 years old, made by the Federal Boiler Co. (Model AST 6 350).

Thanks,
Tom

Thanks Andrew, I wonder though if besides first cost or maintenance related
issues there are any energy savings at all, and if so why is that the case.
I Read about better performance of evaporator running with lower air
temperature in a DOAS, but you still need energy to treat ventilation air
in the DOAS system, so were are the savings coming from?

Tom,

A Combustion analyzer tells only part of the story.

Some boilers cycle frequently due to being oversized (a common situation)
and (of course) when operating at part load.  The cycling brings some
inefficiency and it can be substantial. Hot water boilers, as I understand
it, are more impacted by these cycling losses than steam boilers.

For one of our projects, a steam boiler was losing water regularly via
condensate line leaks in a tunnel.  Our energy model, with pretty good
measurements of equipment power and other operating parameters, would only
match their utility meter readings when we used 52% peak boiler
efficiency.  The leaks apparently had  big impact on efficiency.

Santiago,
Another benefit is that the VRF fan is delivering air against a very small
pressure drop - it has no duct to speak of and is commonly multi or
variable speed.  It also often uses a higher efficiency ECM motor

An air handler probably has 5-10 times the pressure drop with standard AC
motor.

Hmm. Not sure but it seems likely that a wet coil could affect the
efficiency performance of the VRF FCU.

>From an energy perspective heat recovery centrally could be made to be very
efficient. If you bring air in from outside and let the VRF system see it
then you might not get those benefits and the ventilation load might be a
lot higher. This could be offset for heating with a zone by zone MVHR
system.

That said you could potentially have latent heat recovery at a central AHU
where it would be very hard in an MVHR ventilation unit. In more extreme
climates this could make a substantial difference. For example this could
help rehumidify the air in very cold places or dehumidify the air in hot
humid climates. The heat recovery would then be a direct saving against the
coil load (although it would increase pressure drop in the DOAS system!).

Thanks Andrew Dan and Jim for the insights. Many things I didn't know or
never thought off. Now, to figure out how to model what you just said to
try and inform HVAC design.
I guess as with most things related with building performance, there are a
quite a few variables to consider simultaneously before drawing a
conclusion. Ill get back to the group if I get any new insights after
modelling.
Best regards,

Tom,

That's why you should make a spot test beforehand (though it's more
applicable to oil burners it doesn't hurt to do it) and always wear a CO
monitor in the boiler room. If CO went so high as to damage the sensor in
the combustion analyzer, you've got a significant risk of poisoning should
there be any spillage of combustion air in the boiler room.


As Jim said, the combustion efficiency is only part of the story. And I
would add that you should do your combustion test at different operating
point if you have a modulating burner, at least at low and high fire.
On 'small' (=non industrial boilers), and this is probably your case here
since your boiler is 350 HP and you're in the Northeast, you tend to have a
single jack shaft that adjusts both combustion air and fuel valve via
linkages and cam trims, and that's not very accurate and hard to tune (if
the guy tried to tune it at all). What I pretty much always see if that
people tune for proper excess air at high fire only (around 15%), and
excess air is MUCH higher (50% to 150% sometimes) at low fire so that
they're at least on the safe side to avoid incomplete combustion and its
associated health and safety risks, and this degrades the efficiency quite
a bit.

As far as efficiencies are concerned, combustion efficiency is definitely
only part of the problem (and you're measuring it at one point in time
too), especially on steam systems. The time of the 'Dead men' to quote Dan
Holohan is no longer, and steam systems are never working as best as they
could due to improper knowledge of its inner working and bad 'upgrade' or
hot fixes throughout their lifetime.

Short cycling could and pretty much always is a huge problem, a lot more
than on water systems, and even more so when there's a coil in the steam
boiler providing hot water.
The pressuretrols are rarely tuned properly, even on ON/OFF burners, and if
you add a second ptrol (either Lo/Hi/Lo or modulating) things get even
worse and mains and differentials are very often incoherent leading to
never modulating the burners,cycling on pressure very often, etc. Layer the
aquastat controlling boiler water temp and therefore DHW production and
it's a mess.

If you have DHW, summer efficiency is always really bad: your boiler is
tremendously oversized for the task, even with a high differential on the
aquastat (which is never the case, it's either fixed at 5F or the
differential is set at 5F too...), so you get really bad short cycling  on
top of really high standby losses. Expect a summer energy factor of around
0.4.


Now for heating season: typically energy factors are around .6 to .7. Could
be lower if short cycling, etc.
I would also check: proper weighting of the barometric damper, jacket and
back of the boiler insulation (back of the boiler insulation on scotch
marine boilers is on the inside of the back door and tends to fall off
based on my experience), air leakage at burner mounting and boiler doors
(rope gaskets usually), and I'd inquire about when they last cleaned the
boiler and tuned the burner, and whether they add chemicals for scale,
bleed the boiler, etc.


The boiler is only one part of the equation. The distribution can also be
very problematic. Among things I've experienced first hand:

The classics:
- The good old "double-hung zone valve" = people using windows as
temperature control (walk in the streets of NYC on a cold day and count the
number of open windows, it's horrendous), though that's more on the air
infiltration side... (long ago EDR were sized to provide enough heating for
apartments with open windows, as people once were scared of diseases from
foul air, and I think it has remained this way)
- Uninsulated piping (sometimes thousands of feet of it in large garden
style complexes)
- Busted air vents on one-pipe steam spitting everywhere, busted steam
traps on two pipe

The more exotic ones:
- Cut-off condensate line going directly to the drain (I'm not even
kidding: the boiler was taking so much city water that it was completely
rotted and almost not working anymore)
- Automatic water feeder + long time lag distribution + improper piping
arrangement on the return (the height between the main and water line
wasn't enough to push the water back to the boiler): Condensate can't get
back, boiler line drops too low => the boiler takes in city water, at end
of cycle condensate would start to come back, overflow the condensate tank
and discharge 180F condensate to the drain



When you say you need 50% efficiency to calibrate, if you're not modeling
part load efficiency nor standby/short cycling losses, I'm not surprised at
all, though I would make damn sure I don't have another hidden problem in
my model before and investigate more (especially the above) in the field to
see if I can justify this dramatic efficiency.

I hope this helps,
Julien

    This idea also occurred to us when evaluating PV systems on a number

    to have a solar
      monitoring site[1] right down the street, and he had 15min and
    1hour PV? energy generation for every panel (micro-invertors) on 15

Subject: [Bldg-sim] FW: Daylight Modeling: learn +++ practice +++ compete
Message-ID: <1B23446CBF250648A2FC775DE3FE7E80D703E71D@OC11expo28.exchange.mit.edu>

Dear colleagues,

Some of you might be interested in two new resources for self-learning and/or teaching advanced daylight simulations using Radiance and Daysim via DIVA as well as a student competition.


Learn:? We prepared close to three hours of video tutorials<file:///C:\Users\tito_\Dropbox\Projects\MIT_Website\SustianableDesignLab\projects\DIVATutorials\index.html> for DIVA covering advanced concepts such as annual daylight availability and glare simulations for dynamic facades as well as setting up electric lighting designs and control strategies.
Practice: For teaching and background reading, the tutorials are further linked to several teaching exercises<http://web.mit.edu/sustainabledesignlab/projects/DaylightingHandbook/resources.htm> that we have been using in introductory and advanced classes on daylighting and environmental design. In person DIVA training<http://diva4rhino.com/page/diva-day-2015-training-course-schedule> will be offered in conjunction with DIVA Day on October 22 and 24 at the Architectural Association in London.
Compete: Finally, please alert any of your student contacts of our 2nd DIVA Day student competition<http://diva4rhino.com/diva-day-2015/student-competition>. We want to see how you are using DIVA. The winner(s) will receive a ?1000 stipend to cover travel costs to DIVA Day, free conference registration, and will have their submission displayed during DIVA Day, on 23 October 2015! The submission deadline is September 19.
Happy simulations,
Christoph

Subject: [Bldg-sim] eQuest not properly translating AutoCAD import
Message-ID: <CAFewGwewC3FoqfsK8wJqq-dooX0pxophVtWm2nJ4Or3O9QgYcA@mail.gmail.com>

Has anyone ever ran into an issue (using either eQuest 3.64 or 3.65) with
importing a CAD file and eQuest having trouble translating the lines
properly?

I've attached an image which shows eQuest's version of my CAD file on the
left and my actual CAD file on the right. If you look closely, you'll see
several deviations between eQuest line and CAD lines...eQuest seems to be
mis-shaping my zones (for example, the top line should be a straight line
all the way along, but eQuest has added a different angle to the line on
the top left zone).

Anyone seen this and found a fix for this?

If it matters, my CAD file is DXF 2000 format (but I've also tried other
formats with the same results).

Thanks,
Chris

It?s also worth noting that VRF FCU typically don?t have a lot of latent capacity, so they can only handle a limited amount of OA within a certain envelope.  There are VRF DOAS FCU that are designed to handle OA though.  These can be used if  you want to take advantage of heat recovery from the ventilation load.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Energy efficieny: VRF + DOAS vs VRF + unconditioned Ventilation system

Hmm. Not sure but it seems likely that a wet coil could affect the efficiency performance of the VRF FCU.

From an energy perspective heat recovery centrally could be made to be very efficient. If you bring air in from outside and let the VRF system see it then you might not get those benefits and the ventilation load might be a lot higher. This could be offset for heating with a zone by zone MVHR system.

That said you could potentially have latent heat recovery at a central AHU where it would be very hard in an MVHR ventilation unit. In more extreme climates this could make a substantial difference. For example this could help rehumidify the air in very cold places or dehumidify the air in hot humid climates. The heat recovery would then be a direct saving against the coil load (although it would increase pressure drop in the DOAS system!).

Thanks Andrew, I wonder though if besides first cost or maintenance related issues there are any energy savings at all, and if so why is that the case. I Read about better performance of evaporator running with lower air temperature in a DOAS, but you still need energy to treat ventilation air in the DOAS system, so were are the savings coming from?



On 21 July 2015 at 10:39, Andrew Corney <andrew.corney at sefaira.com<mailto:andrew.corney at sefaira.com>> wrote:
Hi Santiago,

One benefit might be the ability to do the dehumidification remotely via the DOAS system. This could alleviate the maintenance of drip trays / condensate drains from your VRF fan coil units. You might also be able to down-spec the VRF fan coils that you are using as well (possibly reducing size).

Another benefit would be that it might be cheaper to do a higher performance style of heat recovery centrally that could help reduce heating energy in particular.

So there are 2 reasons!

cheers,

Andrew

Dear Group, Can someone enlighten me about the energy efficiency benefits of conditioning the ventilation air in a VRF + DOAS system, versus letting the VRF handle all the load (internal loads + Ventilation loads).

Subject: [Bldg-sim] 'arithmetical' heat loss versus dynamic simulation
Message-ID: <CAOQXAFAQKLGEm7H67U4MFq0mdAq60+suORPkqj7oVgXF_-3ZZw@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to form a rationale for a relatively quick and dirty assessment
of some BMS signals and excel appears to be the best tool for this.
However, my usage is limited to fairly crude funcitons.

I have heard that calculations using the form Q = [?UA + ?NV/3].?T for
correlate closely with more sophisticated simulation methods, when
restricted to heat loss. In my mind this makes sense: in heat loss the flow
of heat is uni-directional. This is in contrast to cooling where there is
usually some form of 'capacitance' necessitating something a bit more
'numerical'. There are other limitations, but these may be
expedient. Does anybody have experience of, or is aware of, any of the
following:

   - Relevant papers or reports
   - Usage of such an equation for anything other than a simple heat loss
   at a fixed design temperature (e.g. binned or time step based calculation)

Kind regards

Chris

For the baseline fan power limitation, the pressure drop allowances are defined.  I am a bit fuzzy on the definition of "Return/Exhaust Control Devices".  A system with a return fan and OA economizer typically has dampers to control the flow of the OA, return/exhaust air streams.  Would these dampers qualify as a Return/Exhaust Control Device?

Here is an abstract from 90.1 User?s Manual that answers your question:

 

Pressure Drop Adjustment Devices

This section provides a description of the

types of devices that quality for additional

fan power. ?

 

???

Return and/or exhaust airflow control devices.

Some types of spaces such as laboratories,

test rooms, or operating rooms require

that an airflow control device be provided

at both the supply air delivery point and at

the exhaust. The exhaust airflow control

device is typically modulated to maintain a

negative or positive space pressure relative

to surrounding spaces. An additional

pressure drop and associated brake

horsepower adjustment is permitted when

this type of device is installed. The credit

may be taken when some spaces served by

an air handler have exhaust airflow devices

and other spaces do not. However, the

credit is taken only for the CFM of air that

is delivered to spaces with a qualifying

exhaust air flow device.

HI Chris,

 

The base  fan power allowance already includes the necessary pressure drop for return/exhaust dampers  in the air handler.  The adjustment for exhaust/return control devices refers to damper boxes or other devices used to control space pressurization like you would typically find in a laboratory or hospital.  

 

Cheers,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] PhD position: Computational performance optimization of
	responsive
Message-ID: <E9F3E08142611F4A89071344B1A25456289A52A3@XSERVER20A.campus.tue.nl>

Dear colleagues,

This is to make you aware of a new PhD position in our group: http://jobs.tue.nl/nl/vacature/phd-computational-performance-optimization-of-responsive-buildings-225603.html

The research will focus on energy-efficient and cost-effective optimization of innovative responsive building elements (RBE); i.e. elements that can change their properties over time, in response to varying occupant needs, smart grid interaction and weather conditions.
The objective of this PhD research is to develop and test a computational performance assessment framework that can be used to analyze the direct (e.g. energy, emissions, comfort) as well as indirect performance benefits of buildings with RBE. Using a series of case studies, the application potential of this framework will be demonstrated.
Outcomes from the case studies will be used to inspire further product/concept development towards high-potential RBE solutions.

Please forward this message as you see fit.

Vriendelijke groet / Kind regards,

Jan Hensen
