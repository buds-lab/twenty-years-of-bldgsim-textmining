It appears eQuest cannot use anything but air to cool chillers. I believe water source heat pumps can. Does anyone have a suggestion as to how to model this?
Thanks.

eQUEST can model a water cooled chiller attached to a condenser water loop. You can attach the condenser loop to a ground loop heat exchanger.

Haven?t tried this myself, but there is an option for a lake/well loop where you can attach a temperature schedule to the loop. I would try experimenting with this.

It is unclear why this comment is stated for a project pursuing version 2.2.  A space served by a unit heater must be modeled with cooling identical to its system modeled in baseline per ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Table G3.1.10.d.  A unit heater is not acceptable criteria for exception to G3.1.1.  Therefore if a building baseline HVAC system type is regarding as VAV then spaces served by unit heaters must also have a VAV baseline HVAC system type.



It is understood that ASHRAE 90.1-2010 contains an exception to Table G3.1.10.d and that G3.1.1 contains exception e.  However, this should not apply to V2.2.

Hi Nick, I see what you mean.  Essentially, the first paragraph of my post is the Review Comment.  Everything after is my rant.  I do not believe that a heating only space would automatically qualify for exception to G3.1.1 in ASHRAE 90.1-2004.  The post was only to verify that there was no other criteria for selecting baseline system types for heating only spaces in ASHRAE 90.1-2004 other than the baseline system type tables.

Yes, my response was to clarify compliance with 2004 and I did leave out reference to 2010.

Thanks,

Kevin,

The formatting below leaves me confused as to where the comment ends and your response begins (and ends again?)?

If your models are in compliance with 90.1-2004, I think the core request here is to clarify that?s the case.  Describe fully how the spaces in question are handled in the Proposed and Baseline case, and cite the specific passages and exceptions (if any) applied.  Evoking later editions of 90.1 (specifically baseline systems 9 and/or 10) may unnecessarily confuse the issue.

Along the way, you should probably clarify whether you are or are not attempting to make the case for an exception under G3.1.1 (the text preceding table G3.1), as that also seems to be up in the air.  If you are, be sure to substantiate how the exception applies in your clarification.

If after all this, the particulars of your project leave you unsure of how to apply 90.1-2004 for LEED v2.2 on this front, you may want to contact GBCI directly with the details using their ?contact us? form (wherein you may request a phone call if it?s necessary to convey the full situation):   www.gbci.org/ContactUs<http://www.gbci.org/ContactUs>

Hi Kevin,



I agree a heating-only space is not grounds alone to require/justify an
exception under G3.1.1.



Provided no criteria are in place to trigger an exception under G3.1.1.,
language determining your baseline system type(s) and how to approach
heating-only spaces should be largely* confined between Tables G3.1,
G3.1.1A (incl. footnotes) and G3.1.1B.



* The other spot which may be of interest on this front would be the
glossary entries defining a conditioned/semi-heated space (and thereby what
DOESN?T classify as a conditioned space for the purpose of whether to apply
baseline cooling to the proposed case).

identical to its system modeled in baseline per ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Table
G3.1.10.d.  A unit heater is not acceptable criteria for exception to
G3.1.1.  Therefore if a building baseline HVAC system type is regarding as
VAV then spaces served by unit heaters must also have a VAV baseline HVAC
system type.



It is understood that ASHRAE 90.1-2010 contains an exception to Table
G3.1.10.d and that G3.1.1 contains exception e.  However, this should not
apply to V2.2.



Am I missing something again or is this a plug-in comment from later
versions?



Thank you.

DESCRIPTION
Dr. Charlie ?ur?ija, a scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
(LBNL), will teach this workshop about the tool COMFEN, which he develops
at LBNL. COMFEN is an early-design energy modeling tool designed to make
informed decisions about building fundamentals by considering the design of
the building envelope, orientation and massing on building performance.
COMFEN focuses on the concept of a ?space? or ?room? and uses the
EnergyPlus and RADIANCE engines and a simple, graphic user interface to
allow the user to explore the effects of changing key early-design input
variables for the fa?ade, internal loads, lighting controls and HVAC system
on energy consumption, peak energy demand, and thermal and visual comfort.
COMFEN provides the ability to import glazing systems that have been
developed in LBNL WINDOW, utilizing the International Glazing DataBase
(IGDB) for glass choices. Comparative results are rapidly presented in a
variety of graphic and tabular formats to help users move toward optimal
fa?ade and fenestration design choices.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] WEATHER DATA:  the TMY3 weather files for 1,
 020 US locations have been revised
Message-ID: <54B7203D.8060208@whiteboxtechnologies.com>

Revision of TMY3 Weather Files

White Box Technologies (WBT), in collaboration with the National Renewable Energy 
Laboratory (NREL), has revised the TMY3 weather files to correct inconsistencies in units 
for illuminances, improve the reporting of Liquid Precipitation, replace all missing 
records with interpolated or filled values (chiefly for visibility, ceiling height, 
aerosol optical depth, and albedo), and add a new variable for Present Weather.

Since their release in 2005, the TMY3 weather files covering 1,020 locations in the US and 
dependencies has become the standard set of weather files for use in computer simulations 
of solar energy conversion systems and buildings. For more information about the TMY3 data 
set, please go to http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/1991-2005/tmy3.

The intent of this revision is not to redo the fundamental analysis, but to correct some 
known errors and make modest improvements in the reporting of subsidiary climate 
variables. The only changes affecting building energy simulations are those for 
Illuminance (used in daylighting programs such as Radiance), and Liquid Precipitation 
(used in EnergyPlus to model green roofs, and other programs that model moisture migration 
in building envelope). Filling in missing data for Visibility, Ceiling Height, etc., 
should have no effect on any known simulation program, but makes the TMY3 files more 
usable for further analysis.

Explanation of changes in content:

1) Illuminance. The TMY3s contain values for Global Horizontal, Direct Normal, Diffuse 
Horizontal, and Zenith Illuminance that are calculated based on the sun position and solar 
radiation. Although the documentation states that the units are 100 lux for the first 
three illuminances, and 10 candela/m2 for the Zenith Illuminance, all the TMY3 files used 
these units only for the period Jan. 2-31, and for the rest of the year used units of lux 
and candela/m2, respectively. NREL put out a notice in August 2008 (see the link listed 
earlier) informing users of this discrepancy and promising a corrected version that didn't 
make it out until now! In this revision, we've decided to keep the units in the original 
TMY3 documentation, i.e., 100 lux or 10 candela/m2, which is the same as what was in the 
TMY2, and avoids the superfluous five-digit precision.

2) Liquid Precipitation. The TMY3s are the first set of TMY files to contain Liquid 
Precipitation (rainfall). In the original TMY3 files, rainfall was taken directly from 
weather station reports with two numbers, one for the amount and the other for the 
duration in hours of the rainfall. The difficulties moving this reporting to hourly 
weather files are: (1) the rainfall needs to be apportioned to hourly values, and (2) 
there can be multiple or overlapping records that were ignored. Furthermore, by changing 
the precipitation units from 0.1mm to 1mm, the TMY3s contained significant round-off 
errors. In this revision, WBT went back to the raw weather reports from the National 
Climatic Data Center (NCDC) and applied a procedure developed for ASHRAE RP-1477 that 
checks for multiple records as well as disaggregate the rainfall to hourly values. To 
winnow out spurious reports, filters were added to limit the maximum amount of rainfall 
per hour, and to omit it if the dewpoint temperature dropped below freezing. Overall, the 
revised rainfall correlated much better to historical averages, although there probably 
remains significant undercounting in a number of locations. For example, 23 locations out 
of the 1,020 (2.3%) reported no rainfall throughout the year (see 
www.whiteboxtechnologies/download_TMY3_liqprec_rpt.htm for a more thorough discussion).

3) Filling in missing values. One of the main reasons to use processed weather files like 
TMY3s is the absence of missing records, as often found in raw weather data. Thus, it was 
surprising that the original TMY3s contained a lot of missing data, albeit almost all for 
secondary variables like Liquid Precipitation, Visibility, Ceiling Height, calculated 
variables like Aerosol Optical Depth and Albedo, and on one file (Mountain View CA) Wind 
Direction. Although none of these instances will likely cause problems for simulations, in 
the spirit of completeness all of them have been filled using either linear interpolation 
for continuous values (Visibility, Ceiling Height, etc.) or a step function for discrete 
values (Wind Direction).

4) Present Weather. This variable is a qualitative description of weather conditions, 
e.g., clear, rain, snow, etc., generally recorded using a numerical code. Although the 
TMY3s do not contain this variable, the previous TMY2s did using a 10-digit numerical 
code. Although Present Weather is not used directly in any calculations, it's a useful 
variable to corroborate other variables for precipitation, cloud cover, etc. For example, 
in revising the Liquid Precipitation described earlier, Present Weather was used to decide 
whether or not reported heavy rainfall was bogus. In this revision, an extra field has 
been added to the end of each line with the international METAR 2-digit code for Present 
Weather (please see Appendix C of the ASHRAE RP-1477 final report for coding).

Explanation of changes in format

The canonical form of the TMY3 files are in the *.CSV format. Since the illuminance data 
revert back to the units in the TMY3 documentation, there are only two minor changes in 
the TMY3.CSV format: (1) unit for Liquid precipitation depth (Variable 65) is changed from 
1mm to 0.1mm, (2) a 2-digit number for Present Weather has been added at the end of each 
line as Variable 69. For those familiar with ASHRAE's IWEC2 files, with these changes the 
data line format of the two types of files are now exactly the same, although the header 
line formats remain slightly different.
Conversion of the revised TMY3.CSV files to TMY2 or EPW should not be a problem, as long 
as the change in units for Liquid Precipitation has been noted, and the illuminance units 
are those in the original TMY3 documentation. Conversion of the revised TMY3.CSV files to 
BINM is unnecessary since the BINM files do not include any of the changed variables.

The updated TMY3 files are available on the NREL TMY3 web site at 
http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/1991-2005/tmy3. The revised files are labeled 
as *TYA.CSV to distinguish them from the previous *TY.CSV files, which will remain on the 
Web site for another month before being taken down.

The updated TMY3 files in EPW and BINM formats are available on the WBT Weather web site 
at http://weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com/wd-TMY3 or by selecting File Type "TMY3" at 
http://weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com/search. The zip file names are unchanged, but the 
underlying EPW and DDY files are labelled as *TYA.epw, etc., to distinguish them from the 
previous versions.

Supplemental data of interest to EnergyPlus users

In addition to the weather file, EnergyPlus also needs a *.DDY file that's typically taken 
from a data base of design conditions in the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals (HOF). With 
the proliferating availability of weather files, there are times when a location is not 
listed in the HOF and the attached DDY file is blank, as is the case for 57 of the 1,020 
TMY3 locations. Since WBT has weather files for thousands of stations going back to 2001, 
this allowed us to calculate the design conditions for all 1,020 TMY3 files following the 
ASHRAE design day procedures. To avoid confusion with the DDY files based on the HOF, 
these new design files are given the *.DDY2 extension. For the 57 locations, this will 
provide DDY files needed for EnergyPlus sizing calculations. For the remaining 955 
stations, the DDY2 files provide an alternate set of design conditions based on more 
recent data.

If you find anything unusual in the TMY3A or TMY3, please let us know!

Such a large data set makes it impossible to visually inspect all 90 million elements 
(8.935 million x 10 elements per hour). In most instances, anomalies or quirks become 
apparent only upon use. If anyone finds anything that seems puzzling or unreasonable, 
please bring it to our attention. We?re not promising we?ll fix everything, but it?s very 
useful for identifying glitches which we can then avoid by adding software filters and 
barriers.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] IBPSA World Call for Applications of Student Travel
 Awards - Supporting students to attend BS2015
Message-ID: <92B4D0F578AB284AAD350E3D3C74795C4961E8D2@TIS104.uopnet.plymouth.ac.uk>

Travel to IBPSA Conferences can be an expensive business - especially for students. In order to assist as many students as possible to participate in BS 2015 in Hyderabad, India, IBPSA World will grant a number of travel awards of up to 1000 USD to students presenting papers. The number of places is limited to a maximum of 5 grants and as a result is highly competitive.

The selection committee bases its decisions upon the following selection criteria:

*           need for financial assistance, evidenced in a letter of recommendation from the student's supervisor/ advisor of studies (must be on university letterhead);

*           overall quality of the paper;

*           relevance of contribution to the field of and/or furthering the effective application of building simulation.


To be eligible, the student must be:

*           enrolled in a graduate programme related to building simulation at the time of the conference; AND

*           the thesis project must be directly related to building simulation.

Applications MUST be supported by a letter of recommendation from the student's supervisor/ advisor / director of studies.
Applications for the award must be made by 15 April, 2015 (same date as the deadline for full paper submission) via e-mail to pieter.dewilde at plymouth.ac.uk. The subject heading of the e-mail should be "Student Travel Award" followed by the name of the student.

The e-mail application must include the following:
       The student's name;
       The name of the programme, department, faculty, and university;
       The title of the PhD or Master's research;
       The name of the student's supervisor(s)/ advisor(s);
       The faculty recommendation letter on university letterhead in PDF format.

The selection committee will base its decision upon a review of the letters of support and the final manuscripts. Therefore, to be eligible the student MUST submit the paper by the full paper deadline of 15 April, 2015.

IBPSA would like as many nominations as possible, so please contact the chair of the Awards and Fellows Committee, Pieter de Wilde, via pieter.dewilde at plymouth.ac.uk to discuss a possible nomination if required.

Payment will be made either to the academic department before the conference or directly to the student at the conference.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Internal Mass Issues with Solar Distribution Model
Message-ID: <1421446424830.66973@gsd.harvard.edu>


Dear Bldg Sim,
I am trying to understand how the internal thermal mass (aka "InternalMass") is being handled in my EnergyPlus models. On page 222 of the EnergyPlus Input-Output Reference it states, "simplifying calculations using internal mass must be used with caution when the "FullInteriorAndExterior" Solar Distribution model is chosen. 

Could anyone kindly help me understand what that means?  Does that mean that my internal thermal mass does not "see" the solar radiation potentially hitting it (which might realistically be the case for certain interior elements if they are always in shade)?  However, would you assume that this internal mass is still exposed to the indoor air, and thus could still be absorbing or emitting heat in that way?

Many thanks for any guidance.
Best,
Holly

Hello Holly:

FYI...the classic reference on the use of "empirical parameters" is the paper by Janet Manke and Doug Hittle in 1996 about their efforts to calibrate the BLAST program to a building at the Gunnison Airport in Gunnison, Colorado.  In it they show that, when you are calibrating to measured data, the "best fit" values of some of the parameters may have physically unrealistic values...such as the surface area and amount of internal mass in a building...strange stuff...

Jeff,

I wouldn't call it "strange stuff", but more "welcome to the real 
world".  It's always good to remember that
computer models are just that - theoretical representations that may not 
match the real world reality in all
its complexity, i.e., having all the inputs correctly defined doesn't 
necessarily give you the "right" results, especially on something as 
complex as the thermal coupling between the air and the building's 
thermal mass.

For what it's worth, my experience with another not-to-be-named 
simulation program has been that the
models tended to be much "lighter" than observed reality, i.e., one has 
to boost up the internal mass considerably beyond what's there to get 
the floating temperature profiles to match measured temperatures.
I'm not saying it would be the same for EnergyPlus, just that one 
shouldn't assume because one's got the
inputs correct (right surface area, thermal mass, etc.) that the model 
would then be right.

I'm also reminded of a paper by Joe Eto at LBNL back in the 1980's where 
he correlated measured building
energy use against variable-base degree-days and got good results, the 
only defect being that the imputed
building k-values didn't make much sense :-)

*FREE LUNCH provided to in-person attendees registered 24 hours in advance


Description:
Gunnar Gladics will be sharing the process of using THERM for performance-based wall design. Specifically, he will discuss how the program can be used to determine thermal bridging within a wall, how it might affect energy use and comfort, and strategies to minimize it. He will also discuss the program's capabilities assisting with moisture mitigation and code compliance.
>From the THERM website:  "THERM is a state-of-the-art, Microsoft Windows(tm)-based computer program developed at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) for use by building component manufacturers, engineers, educators, students, architects, and others interested in heat transfer. Using THERM, you can model two-dimensional heat-transfer effects in building components such as windows, walls, foundations, roofs, and doors; appliances; and other products where thermal bridges are of concern. THERM's heat-transfer analysis allows you to evaluate a product's energy efficiency and local temperature patterns, which may relate directly to problems with condensation, moisture damage, and structural integrity."     http://windows.lbl.gov/software/therm/therm.html

Learning Objectives:

1.       Understand the effects that thermal bridging have on energy performance and peak loads

2.       The connection of wall construction and moisture mitigation issues

3.       Using simulation software to meet and beat code wall performance values

4.       How linear thermal bridging might affect energy and comfort

DesignBuilder are running a simulation training course in collaboration with University College London (UCL) this April. This face to face course in London is an excellent opportunity to find out how to get the most out of DesignBuilder EnergyPlus and learn best practice modelling techniques. It is suitable for new and experienced users alike, and is structured to give you plenty of worked examples so you can 'learn by doing'. The last 2 days will be of particular interest for those wanting to get up to speed with CFD and EnergyPlus HVAC system simulations. Our new VRF capability will be included in the Detailed HVAC day.
The course is completely modular and you can choose to attend any of the 5 days according to your particular training requirements:

Day 1: 13th April - Modeller. To show you how to confidently and quickly set up building geometry, import floor plans and gbXML models, zone the building and define and select constructions and glazing. We'll also explain how our data inheritance feature can dramatically reduce the amount of data input required to help speed up modelling and reduce the risk of input errors.

Day 2: 14th April - Basic Simulation*. Learn how to quickly model external influences such as non-standard ground conditions, adjacent buildings and shading objects; use templates for improved modelling efficiency; run heating and cooling designs and simulations and review results; easily add solar shading; and input model data such as lighting and HVAC efficiently.

Day 3: 15th April - Daylighting, Natural Ventilation & Renewables*. Modelling low environmental impact design solutions including daylighting using our integrated Radiance tool, natural ventilation, mixed mode, PV and wind turbines.

Day 4: 16th April - Introduction to Detailed HVAC*. Introducing EnergyPlus HVAC modelling in DesignBuilder and getting started with Detailed HVAC including HVAC templates to quickly load pre-configured HVAC systems, VRF modelling, HVAC plant loops and our Results Viewer.

Day 5: 17th April - CFD*. Learn the key concepts of internal and external CFD from the basic building blocks through to using simulation data to define boundary conditions more accurately.
*Note that Days 2-5 all require previous experience with the modeller or attendance on Day 1.
The cost of the course is ?250 GBP per day, with significant discounts available for academia. Discounts are also available for multiple bookings.
You can find out more about the UCL simulation training course (and indeed our extensive worldwide training schedule) by contact the office or via the training page on our website:
http://www.designbuilder.co.uk/content/view/78/115/

We hope to see you there!

Agreed.



Read any other way, the baseline allowances would arbitrarily ?penalize?
the performance rating of any building NOT lighting up all their
driveways/facades like a Vegas strip? not in keeping with the general
thrust of an energy standard.

John,



The allowance is determined using only the applications that are actually
illuminated in the design. If the design does not include any non-tradable
lighting applications, then none is modeled in either case. For any
application in the design, it is not the area or length that could
potentially be illuminated, but the actual illuminated area or length that
is used to determine the baseline allowance.



Hope that helps,

If there is NO outdoor lighting on the building (except entrances), such as
building facade lighting, does the ASHRAE 90.1 version of facade lighting
have to be input to BOTH Base and proposed buildings? Or can it be left out
all together?



Thanks in advance.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] The Building Controls Virtual Test Bed 1.5 has been
	released.
Message-ID: <CAFh9pRb6Tz2VKrc6yKYOYaO9QBsEhxZrrs0boEnZOEvEPRwRzQ@mail.gmail.com>

We are pleased to announce the release of the Building Controls Virtual
Test Bed 1.5.



The following changes have been made compared to version 1.4:



* Added support for FMUs for co-simulation and model exchange for FMI
version 2.0.

* The example files have been updated for EnergyPlus 8.2.



The Building Controls Virtual Test Bed (BCVTB) is a freely available
open-source software environment that allows users to couple different
simulation programs for co-simulation,

and to couple simulation programs with actual hardware. For example,
the BCVTB allows to simulate a building in EnergyPlus and the HVAC and
control system in Modelica,

while exchanging data between the software as they simulate. The BCVTB is
based on the Ptolemy II software environment.

The BCVTB allows users to expand the capabilities of individual programs by
linking them to other programs.

Due to the different programs that may be involved in distributed
simulation, familiarity with configuring programs is essential.



Programs that are linked to the BCVTB are



* the EnergyPlus whole building energy simulation program,

* the Modelica modeling and simulation environment Dymola,

* Functional Mock-up Units (FMU) for co-simulation and model-exchange for
Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) version 1.0 and 2.0,

* the MATLAB and Simulink tools for scientific computing,

* the Radiance ray-tracing software for lighting analysis,

* the ESP-r integrated building energy modeling program,

* the TRNSYS system simulation program,

* the BACnet stack, which allows exchanging data with BACnet compliant
Building Automation System (BAS),

* the analog/digital interface USB-1208LS from Measurement Computing
Corporation that can be connected to a USB port.



In addition to using programs that are coupled to Ptolemy II, Ptolemy II's
graphical modeling environment can also be used to define models for
control systems, for physical devices,

for communication systems or for post-processing and real-time
visualization.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Revised TMY3 Weather Files now available on the Web
Message-ID: <54CC63A8.7070508@whiteboxtechnologies.com>

White Box Technologies (WBT), in collaboration with the National Renewable Energy 
Laboratory (NREL), has revised the TMY3 weather files to correct inconsistencies in units 
for illuminances, improve the reporting of Liquid Precipitation, replace all missing 
records with interpolated or filled values (chiefly for visibility, ceiling height, 
aerosol optical depth, and albedo), and add a new variable for Present Weather.

Since their release in 2005, the TMY3 weather files covering 1,020 locations in the US and 
dependencies has become the standard set of weather files for use in computer simulations 
of solar energy conversion systems and buildings. The intent of this revision is not to 
redo the fundamental analysis, but correct some known errors and make modest improvements 
in the reporting of subsidiary climate variables.

The only impact from these corrections and changes are for daylighting simulations that 
use the illuminance values, and for building simulations that use the liquid precipitation 
to model green roofs or moisture transport through the building envelope. The added 
Present Weather variable is not directly used in any simulation program, but allows the 
DOE-2 BINM files to have correct IRAIN and ISNOW flags, although these two variables are 
not being used in DOE-2.  Filling in missing data for Visibility, Ceiling Height, etc., 
should have no impact on the use of the TMY3s, but improves their overall record-keeping.

The revised TMY3 files in their native CSV format have been provided back to NREL and are 
available here: http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/1991-2005/tmy3

The revised TMY3 files in EPW and BINM formats are available for free download on the 
White Box Technologies web site at http://weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com/wd-TMY3 or by 
selecting File Type as "TMY3" at http:/weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com/search to search 
using GoogleEarth. The zip file names are unchanged, but the underlying EPW and DDY files 
will have the *TYA designation to distinguish them from the previous TMY3 versions.

For a more detailed description and full documentation of the revision,  please see the 
attached memorandum.
