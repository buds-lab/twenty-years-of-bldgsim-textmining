Joe,

First, I am not sure which version of the program you are using.  It sounds
like DOE-2.2, but could be JJ Hirsch level 100+ of DOE-2.1E.  Are you using
the eQUEST or PowerDOE interfaces?

The primary/secondary loops routine of DOE actually does consider flow and
will not allow a secondary flow greater than the primary flow, so runs the
chillers run in parallel to provide sufficient flow.  While a real life
primary/secondary system can have higher secondary flow, it is unusual and
not normally what you want.  If you use two way valves on the secondary
loop, you can run a single chiller for some hours.  My experience is that
you can do that less than you would initially expect, but if you think it
through, the DOE model will give you results closer to real life than
earlier programs that just do a BTU calculation on the cooling requirements.

Let me know if you need to go further with this.

Mike Roberts

  Subject: [bldg-sim] Chiller Staging


  Hello,

  In DOE-2 I am having trouble with chiller staging.

  System Description
  I have a simplified model that has four zones, two cooled by DX units and
two with chilled water coils.   I have a primary chiller water loop with two
500 ton (6 MBtu/h) chillers and two constant speed primary chilled water
pumps.  On the secondary chilled water loop I have a variable speed
secondary chilled water pump and the two zone cooling coils (with two way
valves).  I have created an Equipment Control sequence that has the first
chiller running to loads through 4.5 MBtu/h and then both chillers running
to loads through 999 MBtu/h.

  When I run the model I am getting this warning:

**WARNING*******************************************************************
***

               An EQUIP-CTRL sequence will be overridden because

               the selected equipment cannot meet the resulting

               flow requirements.

               Loop: prim chw loop                    First occurrence:
6/21/ 4


  and the chillers always run in parallel.  My question comes because I have
been adjusting the capacity of the two RTUs with the chilled water coils and
if the cooling capacity of those units is well below the capacity of the
chillers then they stage properly or if I increase the capacity of the
chillers well beyond the capacity of the RTUs then they stage properly, but
when the capacity of the RTU's is close to the capacity of the chillers then
I get that error above and the chillers don't stage.



  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: [bldg-sim] ASHRAE Standard Public Review Started
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200304180848.AA4850875pd80000292069@gard.com>

Two different public reviews regarding building energy 
simulation in ASHRAE Standard 90.1 started today.  

a) The first is a refinement to the performance rating 
method for buildings that are built beyond the 90.1 level. 

b) The second is a new requirement for the simulation 
program that may be used for the Energy Cost Budget method, 
now it must be tested according to ASHRAE Standard 140 a 
new standard that includes a series of tests for building 
energy simulation program.

The both can be downloaded along with many other draft 
changes to ASHRAE standards at:

http://xp20.ashrae.org/STANDARDS/availdft.htm

Anyone can submit comments to ASHRAE concerning these 
during the public review period. More information is shown 
below.

Jason

PS. I am currently serving as the chair of the 90.1 
subcommittee responsible for both of these proposed 
changes.

----------------------------------------------------

2nd Public Review of BSR/ASHRAE/IESNA Addendum e to 
ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-2001, (ISC to 1st Public 
Review) Energy Standard for Buildings Except Low-Rise 
Residential Buildings

45-day 2nd Public Review: April 18, 2003 to June 2, 2003 
This proposed addendum contains several key revisions for 
the 2nd public review: (1) The non-regulated loads are now 
included to provide a more accurate accounting for the 
energy cost savings. (2) The baseline performance is now 
generated only by rotating the building four times and 
averaging the results; this eliminates the option to have 
equal areas in the cardinal directions. (3) The baseline 
now uses eight instead of six system types; the two new  
types are packaged DX VAV systems.

----------------------------------------------------

1st Public Review of BSR/ASHRAE/IESNA Addendum p to 
ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-2001, Energy Standard for 
Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings 45-day 
First Public Review: April 18, 2003 to June 2, 2003

The Energy Cost Budget section requires the use of a 
building energy simulation program to estimate the energy 
cost difference between the design building model and a 
budget building model. Section 11.2.1 specifies the minimum 
capabilities of the program but not its minimum quality. 
This addendum starts to address this omission by requiring 
that the program be tested with ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 140-
2001, Standard Method of Test for the Evaluation of 
Building Energy Analysis Computer Programs.

Chris,

DOE-2.2 does ground source heat pumps, as do the JJ Hirsch level 100+
versions of DOE-2.1E.  I believe this is available in eQUEST.  It is
described as "experimental" in the documentation, and does not automatically
size.  I have not used the capability.  There is some detailed documentation
in the DOE-2.2 documentation.

Mike

Dear Colleagues,

After appreciated events last year in Helsinki and Lucerne, the two-day
course on NMF modelling for IDA
Indoor Climate and Energy will be given at KTH in Stockholm on May 8-9. For
more info, please visit:

http://www.equa.se/eng.training.html#Advanced

The course is intended both as an introduction to IDA/NMF/ICE
(www.equa.se/ice) for experienced building simulationists in general and
for IDA ICE users wanting to write their own component models.

The cost for both days is EUR 500, including daytime meals.

Please contact me if you would like to participate.

Best regards,

 Hi,
I am modeling a 6 storey building with VAV system in
PowerDoe. I do not get any steam consumption. Pl let
me know if I am missing some information. The details
of one system are as follows:

"5th Floor AC" = SYSTEM          
   TYPE             = VAVS
   HEAT-SOURCE      = HOT-WATER
   ZONE-HEAT-SOURCE = HOT-WATER
   RETURN-AIR-PATH  = DUCT
   HEATING-SCHEDULE = "Heating-T Sch"
   COOLING-SCHEDULE = "Cooling-T Sch"
   SUPPLY-FLOW      = 36040
   MIN-OUTSIDE-AIR  = 0.015
   FAN-SCHEDULE     = "5th floor FAN"
   FAN-CONTROL      = SPEED
   REHEAT-DELTA-T   = 55
   HW-LOOP          = "HW Loop"
   CHW-LOOP         = "CHW Loop"
   MSTR-ELEC-METER  = "EM1"
   MSTR-FUEL-METER  = "FM1"
   ..
Thanks
Leela

Wade,

The correct usage is the second one. The Visual Transmittance Schedue works the same as the Shading Schedule, except that it applies to the transmittance of light rather than heat.

  Subject: [BLDG-SIM] DOE Shading Question


  In DOE-2, I'm a little unsure about how to use the Visual-Transmittance schedule with Shading and Daylight Dimming.

  Does the Visual-Transmittance schedule define the transmittance for the shading device (and window) for the portion of the window covered by the device (defined by the Shading-Schedule)?

  i.e. Do I define the VT value as if the entire window were covered by the shade, and DOE takes care of the rest using the Shading-Schedule?

  Or...

  Does it define the effective visual transmittance for the entire window?

  i.e. Do I need to define the effective VT for the entire window considering the shading fraction for each hour (taking the Shading-Schedule into account, which I've already defined)?

  As usual, many thanks,
  Wade

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200304071810.AA1023531pd80000285151@gard.com>

I have a couple questions about HAP:

1) Can HAP do simplified daylighting analysis?
2) Is anyone familiar with the limitations of HAP's Ice storage simulation
capabilities? I know that in v 3.2 they had the capability to simulate
multiple types of ice storage. Is this capability still present in the new
version? Can anyone give me feedback on it?

Thanks,

Peter

This looks like a better method. There would be no "master" zone, and the
system would be on either heating or cooling with reheat. And no worry from
killing the pumping.

Sounds like Michael has it !!

You might also try using a packaged VAV (PVAVS) system
and setting the central heating capacity to zero (or
very small), and the box minimums to 100% so it acts
like a constant volume system. Then you should get DX
cooling and reheat heating.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200304071648.AA4820265pd80000285074@gard.com>

Is there a library of operating profiles available (occupancy, lighting, receptacles, elevators, DHW, systems, plants, etc) for different types of rooms in different types of buildings for different types of locations?  I am particularly interested in hospitals, different types of hospitals (I assume a County hospital would be different from a VA hospital or a Private hospital).
 
I have the profiles published by USDOE in 1979.  TRACE and EQUEST have some built in standard profiles.  Section 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations Parts 434 & 435 has a few.  Are there any other sources?  
 
In large commercial buildings these profiles have a significant effect on the annual energy usage compared to the building envelope.

As a long time DOE-2 user, I would go with the Constant Volume Reheat, make
the chiller an air cooled DX, and kill the hot water and chilled water
pumps. As you appear to be running Visual DOE, you do not have the "fancy"
version of DOE-2.1E to actually put in kW/GPM for hot and chilled water
pumps. You need to keep the pseudo-chilled water flow going to the the
chiller (else the chiller will not operate). The fact you have electric heat
negates any problems with the hot water pump.
 
Try something like 100% loss or 0% motor efficiency to remove any pump kW.
 
Hope it works. Have BLDG-SIMs other "wise" emissaries input at well.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Modeling DX with reheat in VisualDOE/DOE-2



I have a fairly simple system in a building that I am modeling but I'm not
sure the best DOE-2 system to use.  The building is served by one air
handler in the middle of the building with DX cooling and no heating at the
unit level.  Each of the two sides of the building has electric resistance
reheats in the ducts; I'd figure I'd model the building with two zones each
with 50 kW reheat.  I considered modeling the system as Packaged Single Zone
AC with Heating and Subzone Reheating, however, with this system the heating
in the control zone comes from the air handler and only the subzones have
reheat capabilities.  With this system I'd have to set up a dummy control
zone to truly model the building.  The system also is close to the
Constant-Volume Reheat Fan System in the DOE-2 manual, but I have DX cooling
and not a chiller and cooling coil system.  With this system I'd have to
convert the cooling loads of the chiller to that of a DX system.  

Does anyone have any experience with this type of system and know the best
way to proceed?

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Modeling DX with reheat in VisualDOE/DOE-2
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200304070739.AA3906500pd80000284740@gard.com>

I have a fairly simple system in a building that I am modeling but I'm
not sure the best DOE-2 system to use.  The building is served by one
air handler in the middle of the building with DX cooling and no heating
at the unit level.  Each of the two sides of the building has electric
resistance reheats in the ducts; I'd figure I'd model the building with
two zones each with 50 kW reheat.  I considered modeling the system as
Packaged Single Zone AC with Heating and Subzone Reheating, however,
with this system the heating in the control zone comes from the air
handler and only the subzones have reheat capabilities.  With this
system I'd have to set up a dummy control zone to truly model the
building.  The system also is close to the Constant-Volume Reheat Fan
System in the DOE-2 manual, but I have DX cooling and not a chiller and
cooling coil system.  With this system I'd have to convert the cooling
loads of the chiller to that of a DX system.  

Does anyone have any experience with this type of system and know the
best way to proceed?

Thanks,

*** Upcoming EnergyPlus Training Workshops *** 

EnergyPlus, the U.S. Department of Energy's new generation building 
energy simulation program, includes many innovative simulation 
capabilities including time steps of less than one hour and modular 
systems simulation modules that are integrated with a heat balance-
based zone simulation.  

EnergyPlus Introductory Workshop for Beginning Modelers  
April 28 ? May 1, 2003
Register by April 11 for discounted fee

The objective of this course is to introduce EnergyPlus to beginning 
modelers and to teach the basic concepts of building energy 
simulation such as thermal zoning, building geometry, specifying 
materials and constructions, internal loads, and schedules.  Time 
will be set aside to allow students to model basic building envelopes 
 and systems using the latest version of EnergyPlus on their own 
laptop computers.    


EnergyPlus Advanced Workshop  
June 3-4, 2003
Register by May 16 for discounted fee

This course will build on concepts introduced in the "EnergyPlus 
Introductory Workshop for Beginning Modelers" and  "EnergyPlus 
Introductory Workshop for Experienced Modelers", and will introduce 
some of the more advanced simulation concepts (specific topics to be 
announced soon).  Time will be set aside to allow students to model 
advanced building envelopes and systems using the latest version of 
EnergyPlus on their own laptop computers. 


Both workshops will be held at the Wingate Inn in Prospect Heights,
Illinois, USA (a northwest suburb of Chicago).

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200304020922.AA2252453pd80000281936@gard.com>


Has anyone completed a project in eQuest or DOE2.2 utilizing a WLHPS
with a primary/secondary arrangement?  My boiler seems to be adding heat
to the loop at all times of the year...even more in the summer than
winter.  The same result occurred for multiple weather files, so it
wasn't something to do with the Sunnyvale (Palo Alto) weather file.

If I change the project to a primary WLHPS only, then everything looks
about like I think it should...cooling electric consumption goes way
down from the primary/secondary case and the gas consumption has the
more typical profile higher in the winter and low in the summer.

I'm not sure if I'm setting up the model incorrectly, or if the
simulation model was only meant to handle CHW loops (I didn't see
anything in the manual that suggests this, of course all of the examples
are CHW systems).

Are there any  resources available that have an example
Primary/Secondary WLHPS?  Suggestions on which loop parameters to
investigate?

Any help or suggestions would be appreciated!

David

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200304011922.AA2253921pd80000281579@gard.com>


Hi, 
I am working on a building model for certification for Title 24 compliance and I am using a SZRH and FC units attached to a chiller for the mechanical system. The simulation for the compliance analysis abruptly ends towards the "T-24 Standard HVAC sizing" option which is the second last step in the overall compliance simulation in e-Quest. 
On further investigation of the ".sim" file for the T-24 StandardHVAC Sizing run the error reported is 
 Loop: Chilled Water Loop               has zero design flow.
             Check input for consistency, or specify design loads.


The normal simulation for the model works fine. I would appreciate of anyone could provide a feedback as to why this error is occuring or a solution to fix this.

Thanks

Chris,

We have been using the TRNSYS program for projects very similar to the one 
you mentioned above.  The ground heat exchanger model is excellent, the 
extended libraries contain all the options you mention, and the program is 
extremely flexible - allowing you to configure ANY type of HVAC system 
without being forced to "trick" the program into simulating your 
configuration.  We have published several reports and technical papers on 
geothermal system modeling in TRNSYS and would be happy to share them if 
you are interested.  And unlike many of the other programs, TRNSYS does not 
distinguish between load/system/plant models - instead solving all 
components simultaneously for a better dynamic approach.

With kindest regards,

Jeff

Hi there,
 
I'm a PowerDOE user and switching to EnergyPlus. I found it's very
confusing when dealing with the concept of node and branch and etc. Does
anybody have a simple EnergyPlus model for small office with plant
equipment such as chiller and boiler? I think it will be much easier to
learn from a small simple and complete model. Thanks in advance,

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200304250834.AA3449703pd80000296576@gard.com>

Your firm can provide valuable input to presentations that will be used
across the U.S. to promote the use of building performance simulation in the
design process.

The International Building Performance Simulation Association, USA
affiliate, has contracted OWP/P Engineers and Michael Iversen, Architect, to
prepare presentation materials on the use of building simulation tools.
These presentations are intended for a general audience of architects and
engineers that wish to learn more about incorporating this valuable tool
into the design process.  The presentations will not be highly technical or
academic, but rather provide a comprehensive overview of the different
classes of analysis tools and their application.  These presentations will
be available for use by IBPSA members and other interested parties (with
permission from IBPSA-USA).

We are seeking case studies from U.S. projects to supplement the
presentations.  Case studies should be completed (fully designed) U.S.
projects in which some form of building simulation was used to assist in
making design decisions.  Simulation tools could include, but are not
limited to:  energy simulation, computational fluid dynamics, daylighting
analysis, and multizone network airflow models.  Projects demonstrating
strong synergy between the simulation and the remainder of the design
process are especially encouraged.  Your firm will be credited in the
presentation materials.

To submit your project, prepare an abstract or other descriptive document (1
page maximum) describing the project, what simulation tools were used, how
they fit into the design process, and what effect the simulation had on the
final design.  Submissions can be emailed to:

eolsen at owpp.com
Please give your message the subject line "IBPSA case study abstract."

***** Hurry - abstracts are due by May 12, 2003*****
Please contact me if you are interested in submitting a case study but are
unable to make this deadline.

We look forward to input from the entire design and simulation community on
this exciting project!

Subject: [bldg-sim] Doe 2.1-e, custom functions
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200304241238.AA3848812pd80000295984@gard.com>

Is there any interest in creating an informal group for discussing, developing and exchanging custom DOE2.1E functions?  I understand that there was no response to the inquiry below. 
 
We need add-on functions to analyze (1) central chiller ground source heat pumps,  (2) paraboloic tracking and fixed solar collectors to generate high temperature hot water or steam for heating, domestic hot water and also to drive absorption chillers, (3) photovoltaics for commercial buildings, (4) light shelves, and (5) heat pipes.  
 
The group could also discuss the needs of architects and engineers in practice who have to use energy programs on commercial projects.  Issues for discussion include (1) underfloor air distribution, (2) occupancy based ventilation using CO2 sensors, (3) operating profiles for different types of buildings in different locations, (4) design criteria for space, systems and plant, (5) cogeneration systems, (6) multiple systems serving zones, (7) including stair pressurization fans, elevator machine room conditioning, elevators, escalators, etc. to get more accurate demand costs  (8) showing code compliance using the existing energy programs and (9) the development requirements of future energy programs from the perspective of engineers in practice.
 
 All projects (envelope, systems, plant ant utility costs) in this office have been routinely analyzed with the DOE2.1E program at the preliminary and schematic design phases for over 20 years.  We now have to analyze projects for energy code compliance (at SOM it is always performance and not prescriptive because glass exceeds 50%) when submitting construction documents.  Projects in this office vary in size from 0.5 million sqft to over 3 million sqft and trying to show code compliance at the construction documents submittal phase using programs using recently issued programs such as EnergyPlus or eQUEST is not realistic.  
 
It is impossible to automatically convert about 200 architectural AutoCAD 2-dimensional drawings directly into an energy program.  These drawings get constantly revised, especially at the last minute, and over 90% of the detail on these drawings are not relevant for energy analysis.  Architectural 3-dimensional models (inside and outside) are only developed at the conceptual phase for client presentations.  It is not practical to describe ductwork and piping schematics using nodes, splitters, branches for about 50 systems and numerous plant equipment.  How would you analyze central versus distributed plant and cogeneration systems for all the buildings of a new or existing large university campus.  Numerous imbedded input forms and the assistance of wizards can be confusing and restrictive as programs increase in size and scope.
 
DOE2 BDL is still the best energy program for use in our office and the ability to add your own functions is a powerful feature.  The syntax, structure, vocabulary, etc of the DOE2 BDL needs to be reviewed and improved so that it can be read like a specification of the energy model and analysis.  
 
Are there any stand-alone programs for analyzing (1) photovoltaics and solar collectors for commercial buildings, and (2) reflected glare from adjacent buildings?  Is there a DOE2.1E binary file available for Dubai?

Hello, Joel!

The data format that you want is the format used by EnergyPlus Weather 
Data (.epw).
You can get some information about this at:

 http://www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/pdfs/weatherdatainformation.pdf

Another source of information is two E+ books: Input-Output Reference 
Document and Auxiliary Programs Document.
These books you'll get at:

http://www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/pdfs/weatherdatainformation.pdfion.htm

I hope I've helped you anyway...
Sorry for my poor english...

Has anything been published on this yet?  I saw a couple items on the
ASHRAE Annual Meeting agenda, but I couldn't find anything but the project
description on the ASHRAE site.  Any information available?
