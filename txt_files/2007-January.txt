Subject: [bldg-sim] displacement ventilation again
In-Reply-To: <MDAEMON-F200612281202.AA0256687pd80002400442@gard.com>

I have a question which might have been proposed to the Bldg. Sim. in the past but I'm not sure. Regarding underfloor air systems, since  DOE2 assumes a well mixed space and cannot model the destratification effect and since the supply air temperature for heating and cooling tends to be much lower/higher than typical conditions, the throttling range tends to be quite high. There is an exception in ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G that if you have a high throttling range you can try to argue an exception to this but I'm not sure if LEED would accept this. This might be similar to the natural ventilation issue. Would an underfloor air system which has typically 62 F to 64 F SAT with room thermostat settings of 72 to 75 F fall under this exception for LEED since DOE2 cannot mode the distratification effect or do most people try to force the throttling range down to meet LEED/ASHRAE requirements which is what I have done in the past.  I did not see anything in the USGBC Credit Interpretation Rulings regarding this subject. I have heard the next version of eQuest should be able to model underfloor air systems and that Energy Plus does but until then.....
 
Thank you,

There is no specific temperature range called out but Section G3.1.2.2 does limit the number of unmet heating and cooling hours your simulation can have.  The heating and cooling schedules you establish would be the required high / low temperatures you would need to meet.  
 
Again my interpretation of the Exception Calculation methodology is that if I feel the design I am modeling doesn't need to meet G3.1.2.2 then I need to argue the case why.

		Ramana,
		 
		The ASHRAE 90.1 ECB sub-committee is working on a methodology for simulating natural ventilation within the framework of Appendix G but I don't think its finished yet.  In the meantime here is what I would recommend.
		 
		Appendix G / 90.1 ECB allows you to use an exception calculation method to simulate hybrid systems or unique efficiency measures to demonstrate above-standard performance.  I think this would certainly apply in your case.   
		 
		Here's what I have done on projects requiring an exception calculation method.  
		1. Establish your energy cost budget and your design energy case following the Appendix G guidelines.  
		2. Create a second model using the Design Energy Case as the baseline and make the necessary modifications to simulate radiant heating / no cooling via natural ventilation.  
		3. Report the energy savings from your exception calculation as a line item at the end of your LEED EA-1 summary table (similar to how renewable energy is reported). 
		4.  Include a seperate summary table  for the exception calculation showing the energy end-use breakdown and how you arrived at the cost savings.  Show both the baseline and proposed energy use.  
		5. Make sure the savings are reasonable and prudent for the system you are proposing.  
		6. Document any changes to the model especially changes to schedules that were necessary to properly simulate your system. 
		7. Make it easy for someone to review your assumptions and the methodology you used to estimate the savings
		 
		I hope this helps.  Good luck.
		 
		Mike

			Dear all,
			
			Is ignoring natural ventilation in both proposed and baseline designs an accepted/fair way of modeling based on Appendix G (ASHRAE 90.1-2004)?
			
			Part of the proposed design has (radiant heating + natural ventilation) with no cooling which was modeled as a radiant slab, no cooling, natural ventilation ignored. 
			
			But the Baseline HVAC system based on Appendix G is System 5: Packaged VAV w/Reheat. (Natural ventilation can be modeled based on Air Change method or Sherman Grimsrud method though I do not know how to do it).
			
			I cannot decide how to make the baseline and proposed comparable with respect to Natural Ventilation (in a manner acceptable to LEED review), suggestions will be appreciated.

Ramana,

You may look at Nicaragua weather files. Managua the capital of Nicaragua is located at Lat. 12 deg N Lat. and Long. 86 deg W or Rivas in Nicaragua located at Lat. 11 deg N and Long. 85.8 deg W and San Jose' the capital of Costa Rica located at Lat. 9 deg N and Long 84 deg W. These cities are close to each other and have similar tropical climatic conditions and hence for your purpose this may be a quick and easy option. 
Otherwise, you may contact some authority in Costa Rica that records the weather, it could be either the local government of that city or the airport.


Best regards,

Gaurav

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200701312034.AA3417609pd80001361429@gard.com>

I have noticed that infiltration makes up most of the winter heating
load for several high-bay single-story commercial buildings I'm
modeling. (big-box retailer, light manufacturing facility)
 
I've used a variety of methods - ACH estimates, CFM / so of facade (per
ASHRAE F27.10), and Area(crack) x Velocity(winter wind) - to estimate
infiltration.
 
Have other people stuck with these methods? Or does anyone know of
better ways to estimate infiltration?

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200701311315.AA1529890pd80001361195@gard.com>

When I am performing calculations in Equest I am confused about several
screens:

 

1)     Lighting: I am asked to input the W/ft^2.   Does this only
account for the amount of electricity consumed to provide light to the
space and/or does it also account for the heat the light gives off?

 

2)     Miscellaneous Equipment: If I have a coffee machine or computer,
does this ask for the energy consumption only and/or the heat
contributed to the space?

 

3)  Process Loads: on the screen there are two columns under Electric
and two columns under Process Loads.  I want to make sure that the heat
gain from my pumps, chillers, etc is reflected in these spaces. If I
type in the btu/sf under process loads will that do the trick?  Does the
electric side need to know the total electric consumption in w/ft^2 for
these pieces of equipment or can I leave it blank? My big issue is
accounting for the heat gain from the equipment and what each of the
four columns represents: energy consumption or heat output.

 

As always, Thank You for your help.

Steve,
Here are my 2 cents. I don't know what your inputs are
but you might want to check if there are other values
that might be over-riding the min OA rate.
Make sure that the OA rate is set only by the Min OA
fraction and not by occupancy or actual CFM values.

Hope this helps.
Gerald

John,
It might be that your CHW loop is on "Standby" mode
which might require for your loop to be always loaded.
Try setting it to "Demand" and see if that makes any
difference.

Steve:
 
What type of HVAC system are you running? A VAV system Outside air will only see the mixing with return air upstream of the coil. The cooling coil will adjust as required to maintain the 55 ?F setpoint need as outside conditions change.  Downstream, the reheat coils will never see the outside conditions.
 
Correct me if I am wrong...

Mike:

Check out NREL's SUNREL (formerly SERI-RES) for modeling advanced 
passive energy features such as rock bins, phase change materials, and 
advanced infiltration/natural ventilation algorithms. There are some 
papers published by NREL regarding the natural ventilation/infiltration 
schemes - (Google SUNREL & PDF). The SUNREL engine is an multizone 
hourly energy modeling program that accepts TMY annual weather files and 
can calculate the hourly heating and cooling  loads. The SUNREL engine 
inputs takes ascii text input files. - It's a powerful residential 
energy modeling engine.

DISCLAIMER - the company I work for, Performance Systems Development, 
has developed the only commercial front end for SUN-REL that I am aware 
of - the software is called "TREAT". Check out www.treatsoftware.com for 
functionality.


Have fun - Chris

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200701301602.AA0243906pd80001360485@gard.com>

John,

I am assuming your packaged system is DX.  If not, the next few comments
might be a little presumptuous, especially if you are already doing
them.

Is it possible you are letting DOE2 over-specify the chilled water and
condenser water pumps?  I found that it was necessary to go through some
careful design steps to accurately specify pumps (flows, heads,
efficiencies) in my water-cooled chiller models to obtain valid results.
Also, you need to be careful in specifying the right two-way chilled
water coil valve(s) in the secondary chilled water loop if you are using
variable capacity pumping.  The same design rigor may be needed for the
cooling tower specification.

If the CHW system is running at 2/3 of summer kW usage during the time
the package system is practically nil, then it must be due to auxiliary
loads, and not the chiller, assuming the system schedules and control
strategies for both systems are achieving the same effect within the
cooled spaces.

If DOE2 is allowed to default on most specifications, it can sometimes
be difficult to trace the real cause of an obvious flaw in the results
back to what you actually specified within the model.  It's probably
best to nail down everything if you need to accurately compare such a
simple system to one so complex.

Good luck with this issue.  Please let us know if and when you identify
the real problem.  Could be educational for some of us.

Hi all:

I swear this continued comparison will send me to an early grave.

ASHRAE 90.1 requires a building less than 5 stories and between 75K -
150K floor area to have a package VAV/reheat as its system. There are
those designers that like the CHW VAV system better. There is a penalty
of having a running CHW pump in that case.

However, I just did an eQuest comparison between the two systems, all
things equal (I hope). The CHW system space cooling used 60% MORE energy
than the package system. In the dead of summer, the CHW beats the
package. But in the winter, there seems to be a false load the chiller
is seeing, as the package cooling is almost nil, but the CHW system is
still has 2/3 of the summer usage.

I THINK I have CHW reset correctly programmed for the CHW system.

ANY IDEAS ???

Hello, I am modelling a building in Canada with eQUEST and have several
runs varying the min OA rate. In comparing the runs I noticed that the
cooling comsumption varied as expected however the Space Heating
comsumption is not altered. This seems counter intuitive to me. Any
ideas? -Steve

 You might also double check that your chilled water loop control is set
to demand instead of standby. standby operation can cause lots of
parasitic energy consumption during no load periods.

John, you might run hourly reports on the compressor power inputs to see
if their unloading curves are reasonable.

Here's a step through for those not familiar with the hourly reports:
1. Under the "Mode" menu, switch to "Detailed Data Edit".
2. Select the "Project & Site" button.
3. Right-click on the Project name and select, "Create Hourly Report
Block..."
4. Name your block and "Create from scratch".
5. Under Variable Type, select one of your chillers (something like
Chiller1a if using the default name).
6. Under the Variable List, pick your variables, like "Assigned load
(already selected", "Operating capacity at current conditions" and
"Electrical power consumed".
7. Then, under the Hourly Results Selection dialog, pick "New Report" at
the bottom of the dialog.
8. Name your report, create from scratch.
9. For Report Schedule, select "Hourly Report Schedule". For First
Report Block, select your newly created Report Block.
10. Create any other required Report Blocks and then highlight your new
Report and select all the applicable Report Blocks.
11. Select Done and run your model.
12. With the current version of eQUEST on the doe2.com website, you can
now return to the Input Building Description and select "File" on the
menu and "Export Hourly Results...". Select the appropriate run and
click Export. It will create a .csv file and asks you to select the
report and select Open.
13. You'll likely see the default reports in the first 30 columns, but
your new custom reports will be to the right of that default output
data.
14. You can then do a little post production work on the numbers to see
if the part loading is reasonable. I did a simple test building with
chilled water and got between 0.3 kW/ton and 3.4 kW/ton for the chiller
operation. You can then compare this kind of info with your chiller
manufacturer data to see if it makes sense. Often, water cooled chillers
can only unload to 30% (lower with VFD's), depending on the type. Also,
don't forget that there is also cooling tower energy in addition to the
pumps. You may want to create hourly reports for those too. You might
find some surprises (depending on your inputs, of course) with the way
the CT and pumps are operating. Reports can also be made for the CHW and
CW temperatures to verify reset.

or seen case studies on models for straw bale structures before?  Any
recommendations on modeling the straw as a building material?

 

Thanks in advance!

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200701301020.AA2053437pd80001360047@gard.com>

I am interested in comments and recommendations as to which energy
simulation programs would be most appropriate for modeling passive solar
buildings (heating especially, but I'm interested in passive
cooling/ventilation too).  I would really appreciate any references to
technical papers or case studies that deal with this topic too.

 

Thank you in advance for your input.

John, you might run hourly reports on the compressor power inputs to see
if their unloading curves are reasonable.

Here's a step through for those not familiar with the hourly reports:
1. Under the "Mode" menu, switch to "Detailed Data Edit".
2. Select the "Project & Site" button.
3. Right-click on the Project name and select, "Create Hourly Report
Block..."
4. Name your block and "Create from scratch".
5. Under Variable Type, select one of your chillers (something like
Chiller1a if using the default name).
6. Under the Variable List, pick your variables, like "Assigned load
(already selected", "Operating capacity at current conditions" and
"Electrical power consumed".
7. Then, under the Hourly Results Selection dialog, pick "New Report" at
the bottom of the dialog.
8. Name your report, create from scratch.
9. For Report Schedule, select "Hourly Report Schedule". For First
Report Block, select your newly created Report Block.
10. Create any other required Report Blocks and then highlight your new
Report and select all the applicable Report Blocks.
11. Select Done and run your model.
12. With the current version of eQUEST on the doe2.com website, you can
now return to the Input Building Description and select "File" on the
menu and "Export Hourly Results...". Select the appropriate run and
click Export. It will create a .csv file and asks you to select the
report and select Open.
13. You'll likely see the default reports in the first 30 columns, but
your new custom reports will be to the right of that default output
data.
14. You can then do a little post production work on the numbers to see
if the part loading is reasonable. I did a simple test building with
chilled water and got between 0.3 kW/ton and 3.4 kW/ton for the chiller
operation. You can then compare this kind of info with your chiller
manufacturer data to see if it makes sense. Often, water cooled chillers
can only unload to 30% (lower with VFD's), depending on the type. Also,
don't forget that there is also cooling tower energy in addition to the
pumps. You may want to create hourly reports for those too. You might
find some surprises (depending on your inputs, of course) with the way
the CT and pumps are operating. Reports can also be made for the CHW and
CW temperatures to verify reset.

Subject: [bldg-sim] Package VAV w/reheat Versus CHW VAV w/reheat

 
Hi all:

I swear this continued comparison will send me to an early grave.

ASHRAE 90.1 requires a building less than 5 stories and between 75K -
150K floor area to have a package VAV/reheat as its system. There are
those designers that like the CHW VAV system better. There is a penalty
of having a running CHW pump in that case.

However, I just did an eQuest comparison between the two systems, all
things equal (I hope). The CHW system space cooling used 60% MORE energy
than the package system. In the dead of summer, the CHW beats the
package. But in the winter, there seems to be a false load the chiller
is seeing, as the package cooling is almost nil, but the CHW system is
still has 2/3 of the summer usage.

I THINK I have CHW reset correctly programmed for the CHW system.

ANY IDEAS ???

Virdi,

 

A ground source heat pump would be considered ?Electric and Other? and require System 6 in this case.

 

Hope that helps,

Hello All,

I have a ?Nonresidential & 4 or 5 Floors & < 75,000 sqft or 5 floors or Less & 75,000 sqft to 150,000 sqft? type of building.

If a proposed design uses geothermal heat pump, which system I should utilize for the baseline? 

Is it ?System 5? or ?System 6??

I lean toward system 5 because it complies with the note under Table G3.1.1A since Ground Source Heat pump is considered as the source of heating energy.

Please confirm.

Thanks

Hey All,

I am working on developing an energy model of a building for a client that
wants to claim the tax deduction based on EPACT 2005. As this is the first
time I am doing this, can someone please post a checklist of things that I
might need from the client and a step-wise process to get through to the
results. The building is a 63000 Sqft textile processing plant /
warehouse. I am also wondering about the legal liability, and what should
the final deliverable contain.

thanks,
Haider.

Hi Ramana,

Only Autodesk's Architectural Desktop [ADT] is listed as being IFC 2x compliant, as of 2003 <see http://www.bauwesen.fh-muenchen.de/iai/ImplementationOverview.htm> . But, Revit has recently been added.

It is my understanding that ADT requires an add-on to fully utilize IFC capabilities.  In energy simulations undertaken on the Freedom Tower, which was created with ADT, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories used Graphisoft's ArchiCAD.  This may be of importance to you since the Freedom Tower also involved daylight simulations.

  Dear all,

  What is the current situation on the Industry foundation classes (IFCs) of International Alliance For Interoperability (IAI) with regards to building energy and daylight simulation? 
  Also with regards to AutoCAD and Revit: with the CAD shifting to Revit, is there interoperability between Revit and the simulation tools we use everyday? 

  Any information is appreciated,

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200701260644.AA4438171pd80001358730@gard.com>


Announcement:  ESP-r Developers Conference

Venue:  Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of  
Strathclyde, Glasgow Scotland

Date: 22-24 March 2007

Cost: 100 Pounds (to cover lunches and refreshments and  
administrative overheads)

The Energy Systems Research Unit of the University of Strathclyde are  
pleased to announce the 3rd ESP-r Developers Conference to be held in  
Glasgow this March.

Overview

Much has happened since the ESP-r community last gathered:

q       ESP-r is well into its transition from using X11 graphics to  
the multi-platform GTK graphics tool kit.

q       A Beta version of windows ESP-r has been released.

q       Self-extracting installers have been introduced for each of  
the major computing platforms.

q       ESP-r development has been placed under a central source code  
repository - there have been more than 700 commits to the repository  
since March of 2006!

q       A formal testing procedure for source code developments has  
been put in place.

q       The Install process has been rewritten, and new features  
added.  For example, it is no longer necessary for ESP-r to be  
located in /usr/esru

q       A new email list for the core development team is up and  
running providing notification of changes in each of the development  
branches.

q       New Exemplar models and facilities for managing model  
variants have been introduced.

q       Many new features have been added. For example: new detailed  
component models have been developed for plant and commercial scale  
systems models have been developed; contaminant tracking and coupling  
of CFD to building models have been made more user friendly.

One of the functions of the conference will be to highlight these  
developments. However the main focus will be to discuss the options  
for continuing the development of ESP-r into the future.

Conference Details

The conference will cover a range of topics relating to the future  
development of ESP-r. Each session will feature presentations and a  
discussion on an important development topic. Each session will be  
moderated and the discussion and outcomes will be recorded with a  
view to producing conference proceedings and a development strategy  
document.

Thursday session 1: Introduction and Review

Opening announcements and a review of the current state of ESP-r.

Thursday session 2: Development Issues

There are two issues that confront the community, which ultimately  
will dictate the survival of the code:

q       ESP-r needs to attract new users, as it is from new users  
that new developers emerge. Currently ESP-r, while being an  
incredibly powerful tool, does not conform to novice user  
expectations, the result being that new users are discouraged from  
using the tool and consequently lose many potential developers.  How  
can we evolve the tool to develop a thriving user community?

q       ESP-r has recently passed several critical CEN standards but  
is continually confronted by changes in regulatory standards and the  
need to evolve so as to gain accreditation. What opportunities exist  
to fund vital accreditation work?

This session will evolve a list of tasks and issues to carry forward  
to subsequent sessions.

Thursday session 3: Interface

The ESP-r interface has served the community well, however a lack of  
funding has limited development and in its current form problems are  
emerging as highlighted above for new users but also in the general  
development and management of simulation projects. These problems  
could be addressed by leveraging the substantial wealth of interface  
widgets that GTK offers to bring ESP-r in line with user  
expectations.  However there is currently a lack of interface  
development in the community to progress this task at an acceptable  
pace.

This session is focused on finding the means to accelerate the  
evolution of the interface and developing the guidelines and key  
objectives for future interface development.

Thursday evening dinner

Details TBC

Friday session 1: Mainstreaming Advanced Features

ESP-r has a number of lesser-used advanced features that require a  
lot of expert knowledge to use, effectively hiding them from the user  
community. This session is focused on developing a strategy to bring  
the power of ESP-r?s advanced features to the rest of the community.

Friday session 2: Improving Information Retrieval

ESP-r produces a wealth of data from a simulation yet there are  
significant issues as to how this data is stored and analysed.  
Simulation information is often scattered across several results  
libraries. Further, information data such as fan power or the overall  
performance of environmental systems made up from a network of  
detailed components needs to be derived from the raw simulation data  
and involves significant user effort. Finally it is difficult to  
compare the performance of different model variants.

This session is focused on improving results processing facilities to  
better support performance analysis.  The session will also seek to  
identify where critical model  attributes need to be extended in  
order to deliver more appropriate performance information.

Friday session 2: Source Code Control [Hands On]

The move to subversion has had many implications for the evolution of  
ESP-r. This session is designed to introduce the mechanics of source  
code control to the development community. Features:


q       Review of the structure of the archive and working practices.

q       45 min workshop with hands-on experience in the use of  
subversion tasks and the development cycle

q       Open discussion on how we leverage source code control to  
work in distributed teams and to tackle major projects.


Friday session 4: Wrap-up and outcomes

This session brings together the consensus from the earlier sessions  
(session chairs report) for discussion and decision making.

The goal of the session is a list of specific actions, likely  
contributors and potential  resources which can be distributed to the  
community at the end of the conference.

Virdi,

 

A ground source heat pump would be considered "Electric and Other" and
require System 6 in this case.

 

Hope that helps,

Hello All,

I have a "Nonresidential & 4 or 5 Floors & < 75,000 sqft or 5 floors or Less
& 75,000 sqft to 150,000 sqft" type of building.

If a proposed design uses geothermal heat pump, which system I should
utilize for the baseline? 

Is it "System 5" or "System 6"?

I lean toward system 5 because it complies with the note under Table G3.1.1A
since Ground Source Heat pump is considered as the source of heating energy.

Please confirm.

Thanks

Ramana,

There is still work in progress on developing utilities for import of 
IFC geometry, materials, and construction data into energy simulation.  
To my knowledge, this work has not yet produced a robust utility for 
this data exchange in the U.S. market.

There are tools currently available for data exchange between Autodesk, 
and other vendor, CAD software and energy simulation tools (e.g., see 
Green Building Studio at www.greenbuildingstudio.com).

Dear all,

What is the current situation on the Industry foundation classes (IFCs) of
International Alliance For Interoperability (IAI) with regards to building
energy and daylight simulation?
Also with regards to AutoCAD and Revit: with the CAD shifting to Revit, is
there interoperability between Revit and the simulation tools we use
everyday?

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200701250933.AA335162pd80001358062@gard.com>

 
  We are trying to put together a comparison analysis of ASHRAE 90.1 2004 with the current City of Houston standard (IECC 2000 with 2001 amendments / ASHRAE 90.1 1999). By presenting this analysis we hope to point out that ASHRAE 90.1 2004 is more stringent than the current energy code options.  Any suggestions as to how we can choose our base case specifications?
  Dr. Haberl, Are you tuned in?
  Thanks

You can find a paper that outlines a procedure we use for office buildings at "eslsb5.tamu.edu". Go to reports, then go to ICEBO papers, and get the 2005 paper on commercial buildings.

'How Low Can You Go?  Case Studies of Low-Energy Buildings' ASHRAE
Symposium


As you may know ASHRAE TCs 2.8, 4.7, 7.1, and 7.6 have been sponsoring a
series of symposium papers on 'How Low can You Go?  Case Studies of
Low-Energy
Buildings'.  With 5 papers in process for Long Beach and the upcoming 4
papers
to be presented at the Dallas meeting in January, we now have almost 20
papers
for this 4 meeting symposium series.

But we are looking for papers for New York (2008) and beyond! We have 70
reviewers just waiting for your paper.

REMINDER--WE ARE LOOKING FOR PAPERS THAT INCLUDE MEASURED ENERGY SAVINGS
DATA, EITHER UTILITY BILLS OR SUBMETERED DATA.

If you have a building that you'd like to write a paper for the New York
or later ASHRAE meeting, please let me know ASAP.  To meet the deadlines
for
the New York (January 2008) meeting, the final papers must be submitted by
mid/late March for  review, revision and final submission into ASHRAE no
later than 15 July 2007.

REMINDER--YOUR PAPER MUST INCLUDE MEASURED ENERGY SAVINGS, EITHER
UTILITY BILLS OR SUBMETERED DATA.

If you cannot meet the deadlines for Long Beach and would like to try for a
later symposium in 2008 or 2009 (Salt Lake City June 2008, Chicago January
2009, or Louisville June 2009), please let me know.  As long as we continue
to receive enough high-quality papers, we'll keep this series going.

If you have any questions, please let me know as soon as possible.

EnergyPlus has a similar capability--an example file generator on the E+
web site.  It allows you to create, run, and get results back for three
levels of 90.1--
1999, 2001, and 2004 along with the recent ASHRAE 30% guide for small
buildings (30% less than 1999).  We're looking at adding 189 as well once
that gets to public review.

eQUEST comes with a "compliance engine" which will automatically
create the reference case; but the reference building rule set for
ASHRAE 90.1 has not been created (or has not been publicly released)
that I am aware of.  See volume 5 of the eQUEST documentation.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200701231533.AA3346343pd80001357012@gard.com>

Hi John,
 
Isn't it "simply" a matter of the derating coil heat transfer and
pumping efficiencies, based on the percentage of glycol concentration?
Of course, deriving the derating factors is the not so simple part...
and probably the general solution would be to define a parametric
relationship between the glycol concentration and the coil and pumping
efficiencies.
 
Glycol manufacturer's data should have plenty of info on the derating
factors, perhaps even a parametric equation that can be utilized in BDL.
 
Well that was the easy part... hope it helps!

Subject: [bldg-sim] Glycol Chillers/Pacakge units..


Hi Folks:
 
I am running into a few office/data center buildings where the main
office areas are cooled by conventional chillers and the data
center/server areas are conditioned by either Liebert type package units
or 40% glycol-to-water mix chillers (colder climates that still need
servers cooled). Naturally, both units will be on the same electric
meter.
 
The standard DOE-2 does not model glycol cooling, and a commercial
building does not need the refrigeration version of eQuest.  Usually, I
know the kw/ton (or the moral equivalent) of the glycol cooling source.
But glycol/water does not have the same heat absorption properties as
straight shot water to follow the load.
 
I am trying to insure I am showing the correct energy used by these
units, as I believe the LEED now includes the process loads within the
Base and Proposed models to certify the level of LEED obtained.
 
Does anyone have any "tricks" they have used?

Aaron:
 
Too bad your buildings are not in California. Both EnergyPro (Gabel
Associates) and eQuest model a Title-24 Base case building with what you
give it as the actual building. It changes the schedules as well to
Title-24.
 
EnergyPro is currently approved, with eQuest due for approval by the
California Energy Commission in a month or so.
 
The only other potential I know is the effort by the Oregon Energy Trust
to get a version of eQuest to bless the Oregon version of
ASHRAE-90.1-2004.  Since 90.1 is a Standard, many states reference this
Standard, then add their own "tidbits" to it as they see fit. So it
would be difficult to modify the standard for each case.
 
Having done work through the Utah Energy FinAnswer program, I know the
effort you speak of trying to create a base case building.
 
Email Jeff Hirsch at jeff.hirsch at doe2.com to see what might be "cooking"
with future eQuests.
 
Also consider joining BSUG (Building Simulation Users Group), a group of
modelers who met by web cast once a month to discuss such issues.
Contact kathryn.j.henderson at saic.com in Portland, Oregon, who
coordinates the seminar, once a month.

Subject: [bldg-sim] creating budget cases
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200701231456.AA5658140pd80001356961@gard.com>

One of tasks I find myself doing repeatedly is creating budget cases,
both for compliance and performance modeling.
 
I've been wondering if automated software could take a design building
and automatically create the budget case.
 
I'm currently modeling in VisDOE and eQuest and may soon expand to
TRNSYS.
 
Has anyone seen such add-ons for:

Hi Folks:
 
I am running into a few office/data center buildings where the main
office areas are cooled by conventional chillers and the data
center/server areas are conditioned by either Liebert type package units
or 40% glycol-to-water mix chillers (colder climates that still need
servers cooled). Naturally, both units will be on the same electric
meter.
 
The standard DOE-2 does not model glycol cooling, and a commercial
building does not need the refrigeration version of eQuest.  Usually, I
know the kw/ton (or the moral equivalent) of the glycol cooling source.
But glycol/water does not have the same heat absorption properties as
straight shot water to follow the load.
 
I am trying to insure I am showing the correct energy used by these
units, as I believe the LEED now includes the process loads within the
Base and Proposed models to certify the level of LEED obtained.
 
Does anyone have any "tricks" they have used?

Anyone know of a common and cheap procedure to add a material to a concrete pour to drive up its conductivity from a common 1.6 to 1.7 W/m-K.  We don't want to add rebar nor a wire mess.  I'm thinking of pulverized metal material that would not corrode within the conrete reducing the strength, causing cracks/discoloration.  I'd be appreciative if anyone knew of any research or currently applied practices.  

 

With radiant tubing buried a further depth below the finished surface, want to increase the dynamic response of the slab.

also keep in kind that when autosizing the result is generally that the
system autosizes based on the sum of all coil loads without accounting
for diversity, resulting in what would be an oversized system from a
design perspective. depending on your equipment curves this can result
in low part load efficiency which will affect your results, sometimes in
a significant manner. One way to check is to look at your equipment
operation and see the PLR ranges it is operating in as well as comparing
equipment capacity to actual loop loads. After a prelim run you can then
hard size the primary equipment to a reasonable value based on the
actual loop loads if you don't have equipment selected at your point in
the design process.

Rohini,

Is it possible that your system is allowed to autosize?  If so, you may
be reducing outside air when the fan CFM is reduced due to the cooling
load reduction.  This could explain the decrease in heating energy.

BTW, if you are designing a new building or sizing a new system, it is
OK to allow the system to autosize, and the surprising interactive
results of other changes may actually be valid.

But if you have a system (such as an existing system) that is not
actually going to change with some other change, you should not forget
to fix that system capacity (and, possibly other things) and run your
fixed baseline before you add the desired change and rerun the model.
With everything else fixed, all you will see are the effects of the
desired change.

I have also seen similar results. If I remember correctly, I was
autosizing the system - and the sizing of the fan cfm is small with
shades - which seemed like the reason for lower heating. Also, reduction
in reheating is a likely cause - any report that just shows the
reheating energy? If you look at the LS-D report, you should find that
the heating has increased and the cooling has decreased.
 
Having said that, the shading results always tend to surprise me.

What do you mean by Horizontal Shading? Like fins (the device fin are
vertical, but cut down light horizontally) ??
 
I just ran a typical office (250,000 sf) in Fresno, CA in eQuest.  When
I put 2.5 ft fins on all the windows, I got a slight decrease in heating
as well (but not to your % level).
 
I traded the 2.5 ft fins with 2.5 overhangs. I got a 15% decrease in
cooling, and a 13% decrease in heating. This building is dominated by
VAV/reheat. What I can surmise is that when the cooling load decreased,
the need to reheat decreased as well. That the building is not skin
dominated for energy.
 
Anyone else have a clue?

Subject: [bldg-sim] Horizontal shading in EQUEST


I am examining several options for Horizontal shading for an office
building using EQUEST.
A synopsis of the answers is as follows:
	Total Annual Energy MBTU	 Space Cooling MBTU	 Space
Heating MBTU	
Unshaded Option	 8380	 2411.9	 308.1	
2.5 ft Horizontal shading on East West and South
 
7936.8	 2178.8	 284.2	
5 ft Horizontal shading on East West and South	  
7835
 
2158
 
269.7
 
The Questions:
1. Its very baffling to see the heating consumption go down too. I
wanted to see an increase in heating on implementing the shading
devices. How can I justify that decrease?
 
2. The building has a total area of 210273 sqft. with 15 ft deep
perimeter zones. The shading reduces the energy consumption by 5 to 6 %.
Is that acceptable?
 
Any help is greatly appreciated.
Thank you

I have also seen similar results. If I remember correctly, I was autosizing the system - and the sizing of the fan cfm is small with shades - which seemed like the reason for lower heating. Also, reduction in reheating is a likely cause - any report that just shows the reheating energy? If you look at the LS-D report, you should find that the heating has increased and the cooling has decreased.
 
Having said that, the shading results always tend to surprise me.

What do you mean by Horizontal Shading? Like fins (the device fin are vertical, but cut down light horizontally) ??
 
I just ran a typical office (250,000 sf) in Fresno, CA in eQuest.  When I put 2.5 ft fins on all the windows, I got a slight decrease in heating as well (but not to your % level).
 
I traded the 2.5 ft fins with 2.5 overhangs. I got a 15% decrease in cooling, and a 13% decrease in heating. This building is dominated by VAV/reheat. What I can surmise is that when the cooling load decreased, the need to reheat decreased as well. That the building is not skin dominated for energy.
 
Anyone else have a clue?

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200701170853.AA5310296pd80001354184@gard.com>

Hi all,

 

Has anyone used eQUEST to model a PVVT system with zone voting control?  It
seems that I am only able to specify a control zone, and have all other
zones be "proportionate to the airflow of the control zone", whose
thermostats have no effect on the operation of the supply
airflow/temperature.  Is there a way in which I can simulate the intended
system by specifying another system type in eQUEST, or by specifying a
cooling/heating availability schedule?  Any help would be appreciated.

 

Thank you,

 

Allison Rutter

Michael,

If I understand the situation correctly, your case can be modeled using the
design development wizard wherein you can create different shells for
different levels or different buildings, all using the same HVAC system. For
each shell, you can specify conditions like if it is on the grade or over a
conditioned space etc.

Hope this helps,
Ramana.

John,

As far as I know there isn't a zone level temperature reset schedule.

The only way to do that is to create a custom time schedule that changes
your zone thermostat setting based on the TMY2 weather file you're
simulating.

If you look back in the Bldg-Sim archives I posted a template for an
8,760 hourly input schedule that you can paste into your input file.
It's pretty easy to pre process your data in Excel or a database and use
macros to prepare all the schedule code for the input file.

Folks,

Our office is working on a LEED Core and Shell project in which the
building is a cold, dark shell (no lighting or HVAC in the scope).  Do
you know how to achieve the Enhanced Commissioning credit for a cold,
dark shell?  The only thing you could commission would be the envelope.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200701012150.AA5029578pd80001348741@gard.com>

 
I have a question which might have been proposed to the Bldg. Sim. in the past but I'm not sure. Regarding underfloor air systems, since  DOE2 assumes a well mixed space and cannot model the destratification effect and since the supply air temperature for heating and cooling tends to be much lower/higher than typical conditions, the throttling range tends to be quite high. There is an exception in ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G that if you have a high throttling range you can try to argue an exception to this but I'm not sure if LEED would accept this. This might be similar to the natural ventilation issue. Would an underfloor air system which has typically 62 F to 64 F SAT with room thermostat settings of 72 to 75 F fall under this exception for LEED since DOE2 cannot mode the distratification effect or do most people try to force the throttling range down to meet LEED/ASHRAE requirements which is what I have done in the past.  I did not see anything in the USGBC Credit Interpretation Rulings regarding this subject. I have heard the next version of eQuest should be able to model underfloor air systems and that Energy Plus does but until then.....
 
Thank you,

There is no specific temperature range called out but Section G3.1.2.2 does limit the number of unmet heating and cooling hours your simulation can have.  The heating and cooling schedules you establish would be the required high / low temperatures you would need to meet.  
 
Again my interpretation of the Exception Calculation methodology is that if I feel the design I am modeling doesn't need to meet G3.1.2.2 then I need to argue the case why.

		Ramana,
		 
		The ASHRAE 90.1 ECB sub-committee is working on a methodology for simulating natural ventilation within the framework of Appendix G but I don't think its finished yet.  In the meantime here is what I would recommend.
		 
		Appendix G / 90.1 ECB allows you to use an exception calculation method to simulate hybrid systems or unique efficiency measures to demonstrate above-standard performance.  I think this would certainly apply in your case.   
		 
		Here's what I have done on projects requiring an exception calculation method.  
		1. Establish your energy cost budget and your design energy case following the Appendix G guidelines.  
		2. Create a second model using the Design Energy Case as the baseline and make the necessary modifications to simulate radiant heating / no cooling via natural ventilation.  
		3. Report the energy savings from your exception calculation as a line item at the end of your LEED EA-1 summary table (similar to how renewable energy is reported). 
		4.  Include a seperate summary table  for the exception calculation showing the energy end-use breakdown and how you arrived at the cost savings.  Show both the baseline and proposed energy use.  
		5. Make sure the savings are reasonable and prudent for the system you are proposing.  
		6. Document any changes to the model especially changes to schedules that were necessary to properly simulate your system. 
		7. Make it easy for someone to review your assumptions and the methodology you used to estimate the savings
		 
		I hope this helps.  Good luck.
		 
		Mike

			Dear all,
			
			Is ignoring natural ventilation in both proposed and baseline designs an accepted/fair way of modeling based on Appendix G (ASHRAE 90.1-2004)?
			
			Part of the proposed design has (radiant heating + natural ventilation) with no cooling which was modeled as a radiant slab, no cooling, natural ventilation ignored. 
			
			But the Baseline HVAC system based on Appendix G is System 5: Packaged VAV w/Reheat. (Natural ventilation can be modeled based on Air Change method or Sherman Grimsrud method though I do not know how to do it).
			
			I cannot decide how to make the baseline and proposed comparable with respect to Natural Ventilation (in a manner acceptable to LEED review), suggestions will be appreciated.
