  Can anybody give me pointers to what I should be looking at in order to eliminate this inadequacy in results.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Nighttime setback control
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200606291039.AA3918421pd80001149165@gard.com>

Dear Building Simulation List,

I am trying to implement nighttime set-back and set-up control in my
simulation space using PSZ system. 

The following are cooling and heating temperature schedules and fan
operation schedule.

 

HEAT-1         = DAY-SCHEDULE  (1,6)(90)  (7,22)(76) (23,24)(90) .. 

HEAT-2         = DAY-SCHEDULE  (1,6)(90)  (7,18)(76) (19,24)(90) .. 

HEAT-3         = DAY-SCHEDULE  (1,24) (90) ..

HEAT-SCH    = WEEK-SCHEDULE  (WD) HEAT-1 (SAT) HEAT-2 (SUN,HOL) HEAT-3  ..

 

COOL-1         = DAY-SCHEDULE  (1,6)(55) (7,22)(70) (23,24)(55) ..

COOL-2         = DAY-SCHEDULE  (1,6)(55) (7,18)(70) (19,24)(55) ..

COOL-3         = DAY-SCHEDULE  (1,24)(55)   ..

COOL-SCH    = WEEK-SCHEDULE (WD) COOL-1 (SAT) COOL-2 (SUN,HOL) COOL-3 ..

 

FAN-1         = DAY-SCHEDULE  (1,4)(0) (5,6) (-999)  (7,22)(1)  (23,24)(0)
.. 

FAN-2         = DAY-SCHEDULE  (1,4)(0) (5,6)(-999) (7,18)(1) (19,24)(0) .. 

FAN-3         = DAY-SCHEDULE  (1,24) (0) .

FAN-SCH    = WEEK-SCHEDULE   (WD) FAN-1 (SAT) FAN-2 (SUN,HOL) FAN-3  ..

 

If I use NIGHT-CYCLE-CTRL = CYCLE-ON-ANY, the fan operates all day and
maintains the thermostat temperature for the conditioned zone even during
the times of the fan being set off. If I don't use NIGHT-CYCLE-CTRL =
CYCLE-ON-ANY, the conditioned zone temperature increases beyond 90F, which I
want to keep as the maximum allowable zone temperature.

 

Am I missing something? Is there any way I can successfully implement the
nighttime setback temperature control?

 

I really appreciate any advice in advance.

 

Thanks,

Younju

*Please excuse the cross-postings*

 

Dear Fellow Building Simulators, 

 

DesignBuilder Software USA is pleased to announce one day training course on
Sunday July 31, immediately preceding the SimBuild 2006 conference at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, MA. The training will
cover basic DesignBuilder features, creating building models, importing DXF
data, using compact HVAC systems, heating/cooling design calculations and
simulations using real weather data and advanced natural ventilation
modeling.

 

No experience with EnergyPlus is necessary, but more advanced users have the
flexibility to modify the IDF input files directly and still run the
simulations from within DesignBuilder.

The cost of the course will be $350 ($125 for Students).  The cost of the
workshop will be credited toward the purchase price of DesignBuilder.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200606280457.AA574462pd80001147489@gard.com>

Dear List,
	I'm trying to get an up-to-date copy of a table from this book. I  
suppose I could order the CD-ROM, but I really need it a bit quicker  
than that, and the university library which I have access does not  
have anything after 1971(!).

In the 1971 Guide and Data Book, there is a table 5 entitled Space,  
Weight and Density Data for Commodities Stored in Refrigerated  
Warehouses. I think with re-arranging of the 'book', this will  
probably be in the Handbook for Refrigeration which was issued this  
year, somewhere in Chapters 9, 10 or 11. The table contains a list of  
commodities, their packaging types and weights and densities.


I would be really grateful if someone could extract this table (if  
it's still in the Handbook) as I need it for my MSc thesis and e-mail  
it to me. I can probably handle any kind of image. It will, of  
course, be properly referenced etc.

	Thanks in advance,
		Bob Irving

Earlier this week, DOE released a Web-based interface for the EnergyPlus
simulation program.  The EnergyPlus Example File Generator quickly creates,
runs, and emails user-defined simple models of commercial buildings with
just a few inputs.  Giving the user an easy way to create and review
EnergyPlus input and output results greatly simplifies learning EnergyPlus.
Users quickly create EnergyPlus input files using Web-based forms with
defaults based on ASHRAE Standard 90.1, CBECS and other data sources.  Look
for the web-interface near the bottom at
http://www.energyplus.gov/interfaces_tools.html .  While you are on the

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200606211548.AA4835328pd80001140200@gard.com>


I am trying to simulate  UF system and use only cooling coil for
dehumidification (max 50%)- but without much success. (climate is
houston - not sure if just cooling coil will even work)

Here is what I am doing:

Run a case with min-supply-temp set at 62F - get the supply cfm.

Run the next case with above supply cfm's, and min-supply-t at 53
F(error if I go below this number), cold deck temp at 62, increase in
supply temp due to duct gains - 2F (I have done the other stuff like
some part of internal loads in the plenum etc.)

The SS-N report shows that the humidity is between 60-69% for majority
of the hours. 

Are their any other variables that I need to change? Any suggestions are
highly appreciated.
 
Thanks
Rohini

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] HVAC efficiencies in DOE2
In-Reply-To: <MDAEMON-F200606200947.AA4751156pd80001870035@gard.com>
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200606201343.AA4320609pd80001138618@gard.com>

Efficiency numbers such as SEER and AFUE are useful for enforcement purposes
in energy standards, and for selecting equipment when no energy analysis is
to be performed (which of course applies to the majority of purchases).
Unfortunately, such numbers do not convert readily to the data needed by an
hourly building simulation program.  Moreover, they can lead to the wrong
result in some applications.  A few examples:

1.  Packaged air conditioners with the highest SEERs are typically two-speed
units.  The high SEER is achieved by the contribution of low-speed
compressor operation at 82F outdoor temperature.  A two-speed high-SEER unit
may actually have a lower EER (measured at peak output at 95F) than a "less
efficient" single-speed unit having a lower SEER but a higher EER.  Where I
live (hot, dry summer with a large daily temperature swing), many people
don't even run their air conditioners if the outdoor temperature peaks in
the mid-80s.  Instead, we need maximum efficiency when the outdoor
temperature is in the mid-90s to low 100s.  SEER misses this effect, and the
promotion of SEER over EER in this climate may cause the peak electrical
demand on power plants to increase.

2.  Water-cooled chiller part-load performance data (IPLV) assumes condenser
relief; that is, the cooling tower temperature is assumed to drop as the
chiller load drops (85F at full load, 65F at 25% load).  But what if the
cooling tower is controlled to a fixed setpoint of 85F?  Or, what if the
building is in a low-wetbulb climate, and the maximum tower temperature will
never exceed 76F? Or, what if the building has two chillers, and when the
building is at 40% load, one of the chillers is running at 80% load?

3.  The issues described in #2 above are doubly important for centrifugal
chillers with variable-speed drives; the reported savings are highly
dependent on condenser relief.  Without condenser relief at reduced loads,
the impeller cannot slow down appreciably.  This is because the impeller
must spin fast enough to overcome the pressure differential between the
evaporator and condenser; this pressure differential is primarily governed
by the temperature differential, not the load.

4.  For boilers, part-load and temperature-dependent performance data is
rarely published.

Building simulation programs can be highly useful for studying these types
of interactions, but their usefullness is limited if manufacturers do not
publish data in a form that can be readily converted to program input.  To
resolve these issues, Standards such as ARI 210, 550, etc. would need to be
expanded to report data in a format useful for hourly simulation.  And of
course, simulation programs may need to be modified to accept data in some
future "standard format".

Andy,

You might also look at the following paper that came from ASHRAE Research
Project 1197-RP Updated Energy Calculation Models for Residential HVAC
Equipment:

Wassmer, M., and M. J. Brandemuehl. 2006. Effect of Data Availability on
Modeling of Residential Air Conditioners and Heat Pumps for Energy
Calculations. ASHRAE Transactions 111(1). 

The paper includes another couple relationships of EER=f(SEER) and
COP47=f(HSPF). In our case, we used a set of 25 air conditioners and heat
pumps to develop the correlations.

Also, Jeff Hirsh and his colleagues (Marlin Addison, John Hill, Paul Reeves,
and Steve Gates) did some work for Southern California Edison a few years
ago that involved examining EER and SEER as predictors of actual seasonal
energy efficiency. As I recall, it also included comparisons of EER=f(SEER)
using a larger set of units. I don't think the work has been published, but
may be available through the authors.

And yes, you also need to remove the fan power from the power data. The
performance data reported under the various ARI standards are typically
"net" values of capacity and power - i.e., net capacity delivered by the
HVAC unit and total power consumed by the unit. Most simulation program
treat the indoor fan separately and expect input data based on "gross"
performance of the coil and the power used by everything except the indoor
fan.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] HVAC efficiencies in DOE2


I'm working on putting together a document to guide students in defining 
the heating and cooling equipment efficiencies that are input to DOE2.2, 
specifically eQuest v.3.55.  In the process, I've realized that I'm not 
that confident on some of these issues and seek the knowledge of this 
BLDG-SIM group.

First, HIR for furnaces and boilers, derived from AFUE and Et.  Because 
eQuest has built-in HIR=f(PLR) curves, the program accounts for 
part-load effects like cycling and flue losses.  Therefore, I would 
expect that it is Et, thermal efficiency, that should be used to 
determine HIR=1/Et.  The question then is whether there is a documented 
relationship for determining Et from AFUE.  All I have found thus far is 
the California Energy Commission's 2005 "Nonresidential Alternative 
Calculation Method (ACM) Approval Manual" wherein there are 
relationships for HIR for packed and split systems as well as boilers 
(the relationships are in the attached spreadsheet).  Not sure where 
these relations have come from plus I would expect AFUE to be lower than 
Et which is not always the case in these correlations.

Second, EIR for heat pumps in heating mode.  My understanding is that 
the eQuest input should reflect the COP at 47F outdoor temperature, not 
including the supply fan energy use which is modeled separately in 
eQuest.  If a heat pump is rated in terms of HSPF, then this seasonal 
average value must be converted to COP47.  I've found an FSEC/ASHRAE 
publication, "Climate Impacts on Heating Seasonal Performance Factor 
(HSPF) and Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER) for Air Source Heat 
Pumps," that provides a simple correlation, COP47 = 1.718*HSPF/3.413.  
In this correlation, supply fan power is removed from the HSPF using the 
ARI standard blower value of 0.365 W/cfm. 

Third, EIR for packaged cooling equipment in cooling mode.  Here the EIR 
should be based on the COP at 95F outdoor, 80F indoor, which is related 
to the EER, COP95 = EER/3.413.  For smaller units, SEER is often the 
reported measure, which accounts for seasonal variation.  In the same 
FSEC/ASHRAE study, they found this correlation, COP95 = 
1.063*SEER/3.413.  Again, fan power is backed out of the SEER values 
using the ARI standard blower.

On the issue of removing supply fan power when it is included in HSPF, 
SEER, or EER, there is the question of whether it should just be removed 
from the electrical input, or also as a heat gain.

I would appreciate your comments on these relationships and references 
to any other publications that address these issues.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] HVAC efficiencies in DOE2
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200606200734.AA3425421pd80001138161@gard.com>

I'm working on putting together a document to guide students in defining 
the heating and cooling equipment efficiencies that are input to DOE2.2, 
specifically eQuest v.3.55.  In the process, I've realized that I'm not 
that confident on some of these issues and seek the knowledge of this 
BLDG-SIM group.

First, HIR for furnaces and boilers, derived from AFUE and Et.  Because 
eQuest has built-in HIR=f(PLR) curves, the program accounts for 
part-load effects like cycling and flue losses.  Therefore, I would 
expect that it is Et, thermal efficiency, that should be used to 
determine HIR=1/Et.  The question then is whether there is a documented 
relationship for determining Et from AFUE.  All I have found thus far is 
the California Energy Commission's 2005 "Nonresidential Alternative 
Calculation Method (ACM) Approval Manual" wherein there are 
relationships for HIR for packed and split systems as well as boilers 
(the relationships are in the attached spreadsheet).  Not sure where 
these relations have come from plus I would expect AFUE to be lower than 
Et which is not always the case in these correlations.

Second, EIR for heat pumps in heating mode.  My understanding is that 
the eQuest input should reflect the COP at 47F outdoor temperature, not 
including the supply fan energy use which is modeled separately in 
eQuest.  If a heat pump is rated in terms of HSPF, then this seasonal 
average value must be converted to COP47.  I've found an FSEC/ASHRAE 
publication, "Climate Impacts on Heating Seasonal Performance Factor 
(HSPF) and Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER) for Air Source Heat 
Pumps," that provides a simple correlation, COP47 = 1.718*HSPF/3.413.  
In this correlation, supply fan power is removed from the HSPF using the 
ARI standard blower value of 0.365 W/cfm. 

Third, EIR for packaged cooling equipment in cooling mode.  Here the EIR 
should be based on the COP at 95F outdoor, 80F indoor, which is related 
to the EER, COP95 = EER/3.413.  For smaller units, SEER is often the 
reported measure, which accounts for seasonal variation.  In the same 
FSEC/ASHRAE study, they found this correlation, COP95 = 
1.063*SEER/3.413.  Again, fan power is backed out of the SEER values 
using the ARI standard blower.

On the issue of removing supply fan power when it is included in HSPF, 
SEER, or EER, there is the question of whether it should just be removed 
from the electrical input, or also as a heat gain.

I would appreciate your comments on these relationships and references 
to any other publications that address these issues.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200606191203.AA0314781pd80001137152@gard.com>

Hello Everyone,
 
I have what should be a simple question relating to the ASHRAE "Energy
Cost Budget Compliance Report".  This form asks that the "Number of
Defaults Overridden" be provided for both the proposed and budget
buildings.  Does anybody know what exactly is being sought here.  It
seems many more than 1 or 2 defaults need to be overridden to accurately
model a building?
 
Your help is greatly appreciated.
 
Thank You,

Assuming your greenhosue is glazed then you could model this (simplisticly) by adding an internal blind on a time / annual schedule (Equest) that modifies the conductive layer below the glass.  This will give you an indication in the energy savings.

In reality you will have a lot of stratification and a CFD model that accounts for radiant heat transfer would provide the best indication of the change in convective and radiant dynamics ...

  Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Greenhouse Curtain Simulation


  We are looking at trying to simulate the performance of greenhouses with and without heat curtains.  The concept of the heat curtain is basically to trap the heat inside the greenhouse so that it doesn't radiate back out to the sky at night.  The energy savings will occur by a reduction in the use of heaters to keep the temperature above a preset minimum desired setpoint.



  Someone suggested eQuest may be able to do this, but I recall that there were some solar simulation tools around back when I was in school.  My instinct tells me these are probably better tools for tracking the amount of energy the greenhouse would store throughout a given day then eQuest.  Is this an unfair assumption?  Has anyone performed an eQuest model similar to the one I am describing in eQuest before?

Dear Thulasi:

UVT (Unit ventilators) are modeled as heating only systems per DOE 2.2.
That is why the cooling fields are grayed out. 

The DOE2.2 manual Volume 1 -Basics p. 161 has a schematic. Also the
eQuest Help menu can give you system characteristics for each airside
system available.

I hope that is helpful.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] EQUEST: CW Temperature and Chiller Performance
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200606120755.AA5509796pd80001127904@gard.com>

David,
 
I think you are confusing two different issues.  The rated/design
chiller conditions used to calculate the EIR and the operation of the CW
loop are somewhat independent so your concern may be unecessary.  I
think this will help answer your question.  
 
First: 
When you define the design or rated conditions of the chiller you are
giving eQuest the information it needs to use the custom bi-quadratic
performance curves that describe how chiller power (EIR) changes for
different operating conditions.  Rated conditions refer to ARI
conditions of 44F LCHWT and 85F ECWT, while the design conditions refer
to the actual chiller design (Should only be used for chillers designed
at non-ARI conditions).  When you enter the chiller EIR and capacity you
need to make sure that they match the chillers rated or design
conditions that you enter.  
 
Second: 
The operation of the circulation loops (assuming a reset strategy is
being used) is dependent on the values you enter for COOL-SETPT-T,
COOL-SETPT-CTRL, MAX-RESET-T and MIN-RESET-T and not the chiller
design/rated conditions.  
 
The important thing in your case is that if your chiller is designed to
operate at low CW temperatures you probably want to create your own
chiller performance curves.   In my experience the default curves don't
give good results when the CW temp is that low (55F-65F especially at
full load) because they are intended for chillers operating much closer
to rated ARI conditions.  
 
The best way to check whether your data is good is to run an hourly
report on the chiller and then compare whether the corrected EIR for
certain ECWT and LCHWT conditions match the chiller manufacturer's rated
performance at those same conditions.
 
MIke

Performance
	
	

	I am attempting to model the chiller performance benefit
associated with reducing CW temperature.  However, I am running into
trouble.  The minimum CW loop temperature is defined at 55 degF.  The
return temperature is 65 degF.  However, eQuest is using a temperature
of 70 degF to calculate chiller performance.  The loop never gets above
65 degrees, so how is this possible?  I can not find a location in the
software where the entering CW temperature has been defined as 70 degF.

	 

	Any and all advice is appreciated!

Eric, I am checking 90.1-2004, I do not have 90.1-1999 in hand.

from Definitions, Process Energy and Process Load should include
provisions of make-up air for fume hood exhaust (also kitchen hood).

from Clause 6.5.7.2, it does not classify if fume hood is or not process

from User's Manual 90.1-2004, in page 6-13: the example refers to
Table 6.8.1A to M (it is an error because Table 6.8.1A to J only shown
in 90.1-2004)

from User's Manual 90.1-2004, in page 6-15, the expample only state
"tight humidity control" (not to comply with 90.1, just like energy
for elevator or computer server room, i.e. not included in modeling).
The example does not state OA for fume hood should or not be comply
with 90.1 or not. I highly recommend you need read this example
CAREFULLY, this is very similar to your case

In general, my thoughts are:
1. OA load for hood is process load
2. This load should be included in modeling as non-regulated
3. LEED only compares regulated energy saving, read Reference Guide
v2.1 page 145 again.

I hope the result of our discussion (even no final result) should make
more people aware of, and listen other's voices.

Martin,
eQUEST Puts out a comma delimited file named 'parms.csv' for every single parametric run that you perform (even ones that you rerun), arranged in chronological order. You can open this in microsoft XL to format as you see fit.

Dear Sir/Madam,
 
I have recently carried out a simulation task by using eQuest with a
number of parametric runs. However, I found that the parametric run
reports can only display 13 parametric runs.  Is there any thing that
can be set to display the results of more than 13 parametric runs.  Any
advice or suggestion will be much appreciated.

In-Reply-To: <MDAEMON-F200606081335.AA3513375pd80001839730@gard.com>
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200606090919.AA1927921pd80001124976@gard.com>

Shrikar,

To simulate movable shades, you will need to create 2
or 3 schedules.
1) Shading schedule which is a multiplier on the
shading coefficient of the glass. Eq. if you specify
the shading multiplier of 0.5, it will half the SC of
the glass.Shading multiplier of 1 will not manipulate
the glass SC.
2) You will also need to create a radiation threshold
schedule to trigger whether your shades are open or
closed. for eq. if the solar radiation hitting the
window exceedes 50 btu.sq.ft, the shades will be
initiated.

In addition, if you have daylighting in your model,
you will need to also create a daylighting schedule
which should logically follow the SC schedule.

Hope this helps.

Yes you can use DesignBuilder/EnergyPlus to model Trombe walls and other
passive thermal storage systems.  You can also model passive and active
nighttime cooling, sunspaces, and by using compact HVAC, you can model
mechanical ventilation, displacement ventilation, and various other common
HVAC systems.  DesignBuilder also has an advanced natural ventilation
modeling capability based on the EnergyPlus AIRNET implementation.

Hi! I?m a student , and i has thinking of buying the licence of design
builder. Does anyone know if it is possible to analize passive solar sistems
on the construction with this tool, such as trombe walls, walls of thermic

DesignBuilder is one of several interfaces that will speed
your development of an EnergyPlus file.  The ground heat
transfer in EnergyPlus is based on measured data
and methods.  EnergyPlus is geared to deal with heavy
mass (thermal and moisture transfer and storage), as well
as natural and mechanical ventilation.

(A web interface to EnergyPlus for simple buildings will
be released soon.  More on that later.)

FYI

Although the ground heat transfer in EnergyPlus is more accurate, we've
found that DOE-2.1e does a reasonable job if you use Winklemann's method
for effective U-values, this has also been updated again in the new Huang
et al. method.

This works best when driven by the synthetic ground temps from TMY2.
Results from a comparison against measured ground temperatures for a
Habitat House in Texas show good agreement with both methods.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Software for Modelling Ventilation and Thermal Mass



I'm currently working on a project in Berkeley, CA with an underground
concrete building with very high thermal mass.  We would like to avoid air
conditioning by mechanically ventilating the building at night, and would
like to model this for some preliminary results.


Does anyone have any suggestions for an appropriate software program to
model this?  Are the ground heat transfer/thermal mass modeling
capabilities of DOE 2.2 are sufficient to model this project in eQuest or
Visual DOE?


Right now, we are planning on using EnergyPlus, but I wanted to make sure
there wasn't another (less time consuming option) out there!  Does anyone
know if any of the EnergyPlus interfaces could handle this (i.e. Design
Builder)?


Thank you!

Shrikar,
If I understand your question correctly, you can create a building shade, and apply a transmittance schedule to it.

 Hello everybody,

I am a student at Arizona State University and currently interning at
ConSol, Stockton,CA.

I want to apply shading screen to a waste window with schedule ( so that It
will be functional only during daytime on cooling design days and
nonfunctional during heating design days)
This residense is located in Roseville, CA. I am modelling this in eQUEST
3.55.

I tried applying schedules and facing problem with that. esp what to assign
in 'maximum solar schedule'.

I would appreciate If anybody can help with this !

Thanks and regards,

Shrikar Bhave.

Tom,

I really appreciate you summarizing the emails you directly 
received after posting your question to BLDG-SIM.  It 
helped me understand something new about simulation and 
benefit from many experts in the field all in a concise 
email.  A great help.  I hope others will follow your 
example.

Thanks again,

Jason

Dennis,
 
Previously the PROCESS load was not considered as part of EAc1 (LEED-NC
v2.1).  However, as part of a project I am currently working on, all
language in v2.2 related to process energy, and some feedback from
others (waiting on credit interpretation), leads us to believe that
PROCESS energy cost must be considered, and thus energy savings within
process loads can be used to justify reduced building energy
consumption/cost.
Regards,
 
Paul
 

>>> "Dennis Lee Gmail" <dennis.lee.pe at gmail.com> 6/8/2006 11:36 am >>>
Your lab exhaust is PROCESS load, LEED EAc1 will not compare energy
saving from the process, but only compare the saving from HVAC system
for humam comfort, i.e. only for office and classroom.

Depends how your ventilation system was designed, the heating/cooling
loads should be seperated for human comfort and process. I did a
similar case for a trade college building.

Few questions need to be answered anyway:
1. is the lab exhaust operating constantly, or ON/OFF switch available
on each station so that VAV exhaust is considerable (mine is VAV
exhaust)
2. Can you seperate ventilation system for human comfort and make-up
air for lab exhaust
3. Is there heat recovery system possible for AHUs
4. Did you check ASHRAE 90.1-2004, which regulates heating/cooling
load for make-up air for process exhaust, included kitchen hood
exhaust, this will help you set up your reference building.

Hope it helps

Dennis Lee

Kendra,

We recntly did a similar study with the Blue Ridge Parkway Visitor Center in Asheville, NC. The building has a series of Trombe walls, and the initial goal was to do away with air conditioning all together (got pushed aside for reasons I will not go into - I call it the ASHRAE syndrome). 

Anyway, I initially did a study in eQUEST, running the building in free run mode (I think its called LIMITSUM) without an HVAC system, and found that the benefits of the mass were showing up in the model. However, (and as far as I know this is true of energy plus and eQUEST), the model is a 'lumped node' model (an entire wall is the same temperature, the room is modelled as mixed temperature), so you do not get a full-field solution you would with say a CFD model, or RADTherm. For most mechanically conditioned spaces, this is not an issue, since that is what the system is designed to do - mix the air (displacement ventilation being the obvious exception). In passivley conditioned spaces, this is much more crucial, since conditions will vary significantly across a space, and buoyancies & MRT play a significant role in overall comfort conditions. We found in our building that we had significant issues with high MRTs on the Southwest corner of the building - something the other models would not have told us. 

The fact is, most of the building energy simulation tools popular today (energyplus, eQUEST etc) are geared towards calculating the energy consumption of the building - systems and all, and less towards calculation of comfort levels with or without systems. Again, I speak more towards my knowledge of eQUEST rather than my very limited knowledge of EnergyPlus.

Short answer - I would recommend a full-field solution - possibly CFD. 

I would also be interested in others' responses to this issue, as its been one I have been wrestling with for a while now.

The modeling of thermal mass is problematic when using DOE-2 as it is a
response method (Someone will correct me if Im wrong) I would assume
that energyplus might have an interface for this. But you have the most
suitable program already in your office and that is E+TA, the room
module. This is a forward finite element calculation method and most
suitable for modeling thermal mass. Dar I reference a paper I present at
the 1993 ASHRAE meeting in Chicago. Also look at the work Jim Braun has
completed over the past years.

 

Call me if you require any more help.

Your lab exhaust is PROCESS load, LEED EAc1 will not compare energy
saving from the process, but only compare the saving from HVAC system
for humam comfort, i.e. only for office and classroom.

Depends how your ventilation system was designed, the heating/cooling
loads should be seperated for human comfort and process. I did a
similar case for a trade college building.

Few questions need to be answered anyway:
1. is the lab exhaust operating constantly, or ON/OFF switch available
on each station so that VAV exhaust is considerable (mine is VAV
exhaust)
2. Can you seperate ventilation system for human comfort and make-up
air for lab exhaust
3. Is there heat recovery system possible for AHUs
4. Did you check ASHRAE 90.1-2004, which regulates heating/cooling
load for make-up air for process exhaust, included kitchen hood
exhaust, this will help you set up your reference building.

Hope it helps

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200606081134.AA3442140pd80001123357@gard.com>

Hello again,

No. 12, below, warrants revision. It says: "If you specify exhaust fan CFM at the zone level in Outside Air under the Outdoor Air tab, the air is added to the rest of the OSA cfm you specify."

This point is not strictly true. Kate Turpin has contributed the following clarification and example:

The zone level exhaust is added on top of the zone level OSA, but it will override the zone level OSA specified if greater...  

Example - if modeling toilet or janitor exhaust fan in that space, the
makeup air is typically provided from surrounding spaces (the OSA is -
in the actual building - cascading from providing ventilation to other
spaces, and then serving as makeup air to the restroom).  But, when
modeling, if you input a 2000 CFM exhaust fan at the zone level 
in your toilet room, and 0 cfm of OSA for the same toilet room 
zone, you will still have 2000 CFM OSA added to the system level 
AHU design OSA.

Greetings everyone,

It is a blessing to get everyone's ideas on how to model a Constant Volume, 100% outside air system that exhausts all return air. BLDG-SIM is a great virtual community. Thanks to everyone who contributed suggestions, including John Aulbach, Mike Rosenberg, Jeff Hirsch, Bill Talbert, Kevin Warren, Peter Simmonds, Kendra Tupper, Rohini, Gerald Pde, Kate, Andy Lau, Rohini Brahme, Fred Porter, Kate Turpin, and Jeff Haberl.

Below is a synthesis of the key ideas you all have offered. Although you might be able to get all these details from the DOE-2 manuals (maybe not?), it's a boon to have all of your modeling strategies in one place. Thanks.

...Tom White
 

***** MODELING RETURN AIR and EXHAUST AIR in 100% OSA (no return) APPLICATIONS ****************************************************


1. You have to model exhaust air as return air if you want the exhaust air stream to account for energy (heat) recovery (an ERV system).

2. This principal (1) applies even if all return air exhausted, that is 100% outside air requirement, no RA recirculation.

3. In DOE-2.2/eQUEST, you can input a return fan with a lower airflow rate than the supply fan. This is simpler and more accurate than declaring exhaust fans in all the zones. 

4. To examine heat recovery, you must use the central fan method. But be aware that the "return" fan heat will be added upstream of the HR exhaust coil or wheel, so it's best to input as fan kW and set the fan delta-T to some tiny virtual setting. 

5. Even if "the priority is infection control," VAV is possible in many zones. It's worth examining "Can Health Care Ventilation Standards Be Maintained without Breaking the Operating Budget?," which was part of the ASHRAE IAQ 2004 conference and available as a single article at www.ASHRAE.org. 

6. While most zones in hospitals have minimum ventilation airflows in excess of heat gain-based airflows, the converse does occur, unoccupied periods also occur, and the AIA/ASHRAE guidelines allow reduced flow during unoccupied periods. Exhaust VAV boxes/valves may be required to maintain flow balance, but the savings are large.

7. If exhaust air is not ducted through an energy recovery (ERV) system, the fan energy can be accounted for directly in the Outdoor Air tab at the zone level.

8. You can specify return air as a CFM (under the Flow Parameters for a system). If the supply air equals the return air you can use kW/cfm. If the supply air is greater than the return air for a system, you have adjust the kW/cfm accordingly.

9. If you specify exhaust air (instead of return air), you have to also specify a fan schedule, which may be found under Fan Control and Placement of the system Fans tab.

10. If you want to isolate exhaust fan energy, you can assign a separate meter, just as you can for any individual load.

11. Specifying kW for exhaust fans (to account for the energy) also allows you to use VFDs and, therefore, you can see energy savings that would otherwise be unaccounted for.

12. If you specify exhaust fan CFM at the zone level in Outside Air under the Outdoor Air tab, the air is added to the rest of the OSA cfm you specify.

13. You can eliminate additional cooling load to a space or system from exhaust fans by adjusting the sensible and latent heat ratio, setting both to  zero.

14. To account for exhaust fan energy, you can add the static pressure of EA fans to the SA fans.

15. A couple of additional "tricks" you can use to account for return air fan energy are these:
(a) Use a VAV system with return fans and set the economizer to 100% OA.
(b) Set the specifics of the exhaust system as a dedicated exhaust, but be mindful of the fan power.
(c) Increase supply fan static pressure to emulate two fans (both SA and RA).

16.	You can cross-check with ASHRAE's 865-RP accuracy test, which includes system and zonal fan energies at varying delta-P. Spreadsheets used for the 865-RP systems, including CV Reheat systems are available at the Energy Systems Laboratory, Texas A&M University http://www-esl.tamu.edu/

Hello everyone:
 
I'm modeling a 400,000 sf hospital with 100% outside air and constant volume reheat system. The priority is infection control and not energy savings, so the total ventilation load is HUGE. 
 
Here's my question. I've input all the CFM values for each supply air handler (about 500,000 cfm combined), but -- strictly speaking -- there is no return air since all air is exhausted. So, how do I account for the kWh of all the exhaust air handlers? The exhaust air handlers run about 2/3 the CFM of the supply air, with the difference made up by exfiltration and a multitude of special-purpose exhaust fans (in the labs and so on).
 
I figure my only real option is to treat the exhaust air handlers as electric loads in the building. They don't contribute to the heating and cooling loads, but they are a significant energy use.
 
Can you think of an alternate way to model exhaust air fans to account for their energy use while eliminating any energy use for return fans?

FYI

 

Although the ground heat transfer in EnergyPlus is more accurate, we've
found that DOE-2.1e does a reasonable job if you use Winklemann's method
for effective U-values, this has also been updated again in the new
Huang et al. method. 

 

This works best when driven by the synthetic ground temps from TMY2.
Results from a comparison against measured ground temperatures for a
Habitat House in Texas show good agreement with both methods.

Hello,

RG Vanderweil was the MEP for the Yale Chemistry Research Building, a 137 
fume hood lab building. They did the energy model and that was accepted by 
the USGBC in their first review of our LEED certification application. 
They can provide you with details on their modeling strategy. The contact 
person for the project is Lee Schofer at lschofer at rgvp.vanderweil.com and 
the person who did the energy modeling was Jason Lukes in RGV's Princeton, 
NJ office.

The first response would be to drop LEED.

 

The second would be to suggest that you VAV lab exhaust to reduce
energy, you get an extra point for ventilating in excess of 62.1
recommended minimum requirements. Classrooms will also 100% OA. The lab
supply air will be higher than 90.1 or 62.1 recommends, use the real
world cfm as a constant volume system to determine the standard case
then use the VAV fume hood control to reduce the energy consumption
compared to the adapted standard case.

Greetings

 

We have a project going for LEED certification EA1.  The building has
20% classroom space, 20% office space and 60% chemical lab space.  The
system has 100% OA because of the lab system.

 

According to the ASHRAE 90.1 user guide, the minimum ventilation rates
designed for the proposed building must also be modeled in the budget
building design. Ventilation is energy neutral as far as trade-offs are
concerned.

 

Since the heating and cooling load between proposed and budget building
is different, the calculated air flow of budget design is larger than
the proposed design. It means the outside air is also larger than the
proposed design.  My question here is how to have the same minimum
ventilation rates and keep it "energy neutral"?  

 

This question is more about the LEED certification and if anyone has any
suggestions and recommendations, please let me know.

 

Many thanks.

 

Eric

Greetings everyone,

It is a blessing to get everyone's ideas on how to model a Constant Volume, 100% outside air system that exhausts all return air. BLDG-SIM is a great virtual community. Thanks to everyone who contributed suggestions, including John Aulbach, Mike Rosenberg, Jeff Hirsch, Bill Talbert, Kevin Warren, Peter Simmonds, Kendra Tupper, Rohini, Gerald Pde, Kate, Andy Lau, Rohini Brahme, Fred Porter, Kate Turpin, and Jeff Haberl.

Below is a synthesis of the key ideas you all have offered. Although you might be able to get all these details from the DOE-2 manuals (maybe not?), it's a boon to have all of your modeling strategies in one place. Thanks.

...Tom White
 

***** MODELING RETURN AIR and EXHAUST AIR in 100% OSA (no return) APPLICATIONS ****************************************************


1. You have to model exhaust air as return air if you want the exhaust air stream to account for energy (heat) recovery (an ERV system).

2. This principal (1) applies even if all return air exhausted, that is 100% outside air requirement, no RA recirculation.

3. In DOE-2.2/eQUEST, you can input a return fan with a lower airflow rate than the supply fan. This is simpler and more accurate than declaring exhaust fans in all the zones. 

4. To examine heat recovery, you must use the central fan method. But be aware that the "return" fan heat will be added upstream of the HR exhaust coil or wheel, so it's best to input as fan kW and set the fan delta-T to some tiny virtual setting. 

5. Even if "the priority is infection control," VAV is possible in many zones. It's worth examining "Can Health Care Ventilation Standards Be Maintained without Breaking the Operating Budget?," which was part of the ASHRAE IAQ 2004 conference and available as a single article at www.ASHRAE.org. 

6. While most zones in hospitals have minimum ventilation airflows in excess of heat gain-based airflows, the converse does occur, unoccupied periods also occur, and the AIA/ASHRAE guidelines allow reduced flow during unoccupied periods. Exhaust VAV boxes/valves may be required to maintain flow balance, but the savings are large.

7. If exhaust air is not ducted through an energy recovery (ERV) system, the fan energy can be accounted for directly in the Outdoor Air tab at the zone level.

8. You can specify return air as a CFM (under the Flow Parameters for a system). If the supply air equals the return air you can use kW/cfm. If the supply air is greater than the return air for a system, you have adjust the kW/cfm accordingly.

9. If you specify exhaust air (instead of return air), you have to also specify a fan schedule, which may be found under Fan Control and Placement of the system Fans tab.

10. If you want to isolate exhaust fan energy, you can assign a separate meter, just as you can for any individual load.

11. Specifying kW for exhaust fans (to account for the energy) also allows you to use VFDs and, therefore, you can see energy savings that would otherwise be unaccounted for.

12. If you specify exhaust fan CFM at the zone level in Outside Air under the Outdoor Air tab, the air is added to the rest of the OSA cfm you specify.

13. You can eliminate additional cooling load to a space or system from exhaust fans by adjusting the sensible and latent heat ratio, setting both to  zero.

14. To account for exhaust fan energy, you can add the static pressure of EA fans to the SA fans.

15. A couple of additional "tricks" you can use to account for return air fan energy are these:
(a) Use a VAV system with return fans and set the economizer to 100% OA.
(b) Set the specifics of the exhaust system as a dedicated exhaust, but be mindful of the fan power.
(c) Increase supply fan static pressure to emulate two fans (both SA and RA).

16.	You can cross-check with ASHRAE's 865-RP accuracy test, which includes system and zonal fan energies at varying delta-P. Spreadsheets used for the 865-RP systems, including CV Reheat systems are available at the Energy Systems Laboratory, Texas A&M University http://www-esl.tamu.edu/

Hello everyone:
 
I'm modeling a 400,000 sf hospital with 100% outside air and constant volume reheat system. The priority is infection control and not energy savings, so the total ventilation load is HUGE. 
 
Here's my question. I've input all the CFM values for each supply air handler (about 500,000 cfm combined), but -- strictly speaking -- there is no return air since all air is exhausted. So, how do I account for the kWh of all the exhaust air handlers? The exhaust air handlers run about 2/3 the CFM of the supply air, with the difference made up by exfiltration and a multitude of special-purpose exhaust fans (in the labs and so on).
 
I figure my only real option is to treat the exhaust air handlers as electric loads in the building. They don't contribute to the heating and cooling loads, but they are a significant energy use.
 
Can you think of an alternate way to model exhaust air fans to account for their energy use while eliminating any energy use for return fans?

John,

If you are able to characterize the stratification in the hall by some other means, you could model the implications of that temperature distribution in EnergyPlus using User Defined RoomAir models. Various temperature patterns can be entered.  EnergyPlus also has a displacement ventilation roomair model but it is difficult to say if it is applicable to your space.

Here's what we do for such spaces. First calculate the space
stratification using the Effective Sensible Heat Gain (ESHG) method.
This will provide data on temperatures in the occupied zone and
temperatures of air being exhausted from the space. Use the space
exhaust temperature as the temperature set point in DOE-2 or transys.
This should provide a fairly accurate model, you can then study the
performance. I also think that IES can calculate stratification in
spaces.

You can always talk to Stefan Holst at Transsolar in Munich, he can also
help.

Subject: [bldg-sim] Simulation of Production Halls

 

Greetings Group,

 

I am a graduate student studying building service technology at the 

University of Applied Sciences in Munich, Germany. I am attempting to 

compare various indirect evaporative cooling systems in a large
production 

hall with displacement ventilation. Because the secondary air flow is
(in 

some configurations) extracted near the ceiling, I expect the effects of


stratification to be significant. Does anyone have experience defining
such 

a space or know of existing literature which might be of help?

 

The possible solutions I see are: coupling air flow with multiple zones 

(stacked), defination of plenum space or multiple nodes in a single
zone. 

Each possibility seems feasible, but I lack the experience to know which


assumptions are necessary to obtain realistic results. The simulation
should 

be on (at least) an hourly basis.

 

I am aware that this topic is not particularly new and have seen
multiple 

similar inquiries, but have not yet found a satisfying solution.

 

I have access to both TRNSYS and EPlus. The results of the simulations
are 

to be included in my Masters Thesis, in which I will compare 

investment/operating costs of various industrial hvac solutions for 

production facilities.

 

Any English or German language responses would be greatly appreciated!

 

Thanks,

 

John Olson

Tom. 

You can do a simple cross-check with ASHRAE's 865-RP accuracy test, which includes system and zonal fan energies at varying delta-P. Spreadsheets used for the 865-RP systems, including CVReheat systems are available via the ESL's website.

Hello everyone:
 
I'm modeling a 400,000 sf hospital with 100% outside air and constant volume reheat system. The priority is infection control and not energy savings, so the total ventilation load is HUGE. 
 
Here's my question. I've input all the CFM values for each supply air handler (about 500,000 cfm combined), but -- strictly speaking -- there is no return air since all air is exhausted. So, how do I account for the kWh of all the exhaust air handlers? The exhaust air handlers run about 2/3 the CFM of the supply air, with the difference made up by exfiltration and a multitude of special-purpose exhaust fans (in the labs and so on).
 
I figure my only real option is to treat the exhaust air handlers as electric loads in the building. They don't contribute to the heating and cooling loads, but they are a significant energy use.
 
Can you think of an alternate way to model exhaust air fans to account for their energy use while eliminating any energy use for return fans?

Tom,
Aside from the AHUs, you can also assign zone level
exhaust and specify fan energy and static pressure
across the fans.This will simulate exhaust fans
seperate from AHU fans.

there is a variable for exhaust fans at either the zone level or the

Tom, there are several ways to accomplish this.

Use a VAV system with return fans and set the economizer to 100% OA

You could also set the specifics of the exhaust system as a dedicated
exhaust, but watch the fan power on this one.

You could also increase fan static pressure to emulate two fans.

I figure my only real option is to treat the exhaust air handlers as electric loads in the building. They don't contribute to the heating and cooling loads, but they are a significant energy use.
 
Can you think of an alternate way to model exhaust air fans to account for their energy use while eliminating any energy use for return fans?

 IRS Unveils Procedure Enabling Commercial Property Owners to Qualify  
 for Energy Efficiency Deduction                                       
                                                                       
                                                                       
                                                                       
                                                                       
                                                                       
 IR-2006-88, June 2, 2006                                              
                                                                       
                                                                       
 WASHINGTON ? The Internal Revenue Service today issued an advance     
 copy of a notice on how commercial building owners or leaseholders    
 can qualify for the tax deduction for making their building energy    
 efficient. The notice establishes a process to certify the required   
 energy savings in order to claim the deduction.                       
                                                                       
                                                                       
 The commercial building deduction, which was enacted in the Energy    
 Policy Act of 2005, allows taxpayers to deduct the cost of            
 energy-efficient property installed in commercial buildings.          
                                                                       
                                                                       
 The amount deductible may be as much as $1.80 per square foot of      
 building floor area for buildings that achieve a 50-percent energy    
 savings target. The notice provides that buildings below the          
 50-percent threshold may, nevertheless, qualify for a deduction of up 
 to 60 cents per square foot of building floor area if they meet a     
 16?-percent energy savings target.                                    
                                                                       
                                                                       
 Before claiming the deduction, the taxpayer must obtain a             
 certification that the required energy savings will be achieved.      
 Today?s notice prescribes the content of that certification and the   
 qualifications that must be met by the person providing the           
 certification.                                                        
                                                                       
                                                                       
 The notice also announces that the Department of Energy will create   
 and maintain a public list of software that must be used to calculate 
 energy savings for purposes of providing the certification. It also   
 provides a process that software developers must use if they desire   
 to have their software included on that list.

Subject: [bldg-sim] humidity control in equest
In-Reply-To: <MDAEMON-F200605300052.AA5212125pd80001804215@gard.com>
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200606021448.AA4853687pd80001115253@gard.com>

I am trying to control the humidity to max 50% with cooling coil without
much success (using equest) - most hours are in the 50-59% range. The
manual says that the min-supply-temp (55 in this case) is used for
sizing - so I can't reduce it too much. Reducing the  cold deck min
leaving temp doesn't seem to do much. Is there some variable that I am
missing. 
 
Also, where do the hourly reports show up in equest? Is it still the
cexx.dat file?
 
Thanks.

you can check the DSIRE database to see which state have the incentives 
you're thinking of then contact the DPW in that state for the contacts.

Apologies for cross posting, since this is not simulation related. 

Does anyone know of a resource where I could find a model legislation
for solar incentives for a possible development of a bill to be
initiated in a state senate house?
