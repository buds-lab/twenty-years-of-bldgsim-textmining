Re Diva for Rhino
I am not exactly clear on the total costs for Diva.  I am assuming 
the license doesn't include the Rhino license, another grand?

That makes the total kit around $1,500 USD?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] heat pump design in Designbuilder
Message-ID: <6770429BC4498B45B627F96AF8FC047422D5097731@helene>

Hi All,
I'm trying to model a house in Designbuilder heated through an air-source heat pump. The output I'm after is only the monthly and annual energy consumption and heating load. Does anyone know which HVAC template to use for this. I do have the Designbuilder v3 version that can do detailed HVAC but I'm not after a detailed heat pump design. Any guidance on how to model heat pumps in simple/compact HVAC in Designbuilder will be useful.

Many thanks,
Apeksha Gupta

	Discussion
Message-ID: <CAAerc9eOs2P=5AYdrE192Nc+UrHQkrKBY0duQ_FEDXNO=Vgk4w@mail.gmail.com>

I am the Chair of the conference committee for the ASHRAE 2012 Energy
Modeling Conference that will be held in Atlanta on October 1, 2 & 3 this
year (see link below).  The conference is focused on bringing
practitioners, software developers, researchers and facility users together
for 3 days of in depth discussion on current modeling software capabilities
and current best practices in energy modeling.  I have two questions that I
would like to pose to this group to get some feedback to help provider
richer content for the discussions planned at the conference;
1. Are the current energy modeling tools available to an energy modeling
practitioner reliable enough to allow the modeler to predict a building's
actual energy consumption with a high degree of confidence such that an
accurate energy target can be established and recommended to the building
owner for the new building or a  renovation/retrofit?
2. Are the current best practices of the energy modeling community reliable
enough, and well understood by most practitioners, to allow the modeler to
predict a building's actual energy consumption with a high degree of
confidence such that an accurate energy target can be established and
recommended to the building owner for the new building or a
renovation/retrofit?

Background for the discussion:
These questions recently came up in a discussion among the conference
committee.  It seems that one our colleagues from the UK indicated that in
the UK new schools have performed very poorly in comparison with their
predicted energy use.

Another comment that was made was as follows:
"Often a building's actual energy consumption is 1.5 to 2 times as much as
the results of an energy model that was used to make decisions during
design about the building's energy using systems.  Is it the the energy
modeling tools or is it the processes used by energy modelers to describe
the systems and how they operate in the software? Should energy models be
used to "predict" a building's future energy performance or just be used to
inform better decisions during design?

I have reviewed a good many models and, almost without fail, I never see a
modeler start by writing a sequence of operation and I also never see the
sequence of operation used by the modeler make its way into a set of
construction documents.

Also, when I am the modeler and I am "calibrating" a model to an existing
building's actual energy consumption it is a very iterative process.  I
know what things to manipulate in the model to effect demand and what
things to manipulate to effect consumption.  I just keep going back and
forth until I have a model that you can almost lay its output on top of the
building's utility bill history. I also have a good understanding of how
the building is actually being operated and maintained - which I hope helps
make the model more accurate, but, does that process really give me a
better model to make decisions from?"


I invite everyone to please, tell us what you think.
Sincerely,

Dear Dennis and BldgSim Community,

1.       I think the tools are absolutely up to the task.  My own practice uses EnergyPlus exclusively, but I know that most of the other tools are based in solid thermodynamic and physical principles - so they start on a solid foundation.

2.       Current best practices is another story altogether!

a.       Keeping in mind that I know only the "Best practices" for my own firm ...

b.      Energy modelers of new construction are normally given scant information.

*   Partly this is due to the owner not knowing exactly how the new facility will be used.

*   Partly this is due to the Owner and Designer not caring about, not appreciating the importance of, or just not needing to gather detailed information about the operation of a building that hasn't been built.

*   Partly it's because "as built" is never "as designed". (Think of fan and pump pressure estimates differing from actual, weather variances, occupancy schedule changes, etc.)

*   The energy modeling community has, it seems, a lot of bright young men and women who are "learning the ropes".  The fact that they are becoming involved is very exciting!  Their education must be broadened, however, in order for them to become effective at modeling existing buildings. It's no longer just theory;  there is a lot of practical, "hands on" activity that is needed.

3.       Inferred above is the host of variables that differ in an actual building's operation from what may have been assumed.  The older the building, the more variations there are!

4.       Most building operators, if they exist within the building as a full time position, are distracted with many other details and spent precious little time optimizing energy performance.  If there is no full time building operator .....

5.       This is a field ripe with opportunity!  The first and hardest task, I think, is to get building owners convinced that the ROI for optimal building performance is better than any of their other opportunities for investing.  The next task is to streamline the process of calibration and identification of opportunities so that they is faster and more economical.

6.       ... and I'd love to expand this discussion during the Q&A period at my presentation on this topic during the ASHRAE Energy Modeling Conference!

Jim said most of what I was going to say. Additionally,

*         An energy modeler's task for a new construction project is rarely to accurately predict energy use, but to demonstrate compliance with, and improvement over, code performance.

*         Modelers generally do not fine tune plug loads, occupant numbers and schedules etc. because these are kept identical for determining improved performance over code.

*         Sequence of operations. The modeler is usually not the engineer of record, and should therefore not be dictating the sequence of operations of HVAC/plant equipment. I may provide the mechanical engineer with suggestions on controls strategies and setpoints, and sometimes they are receptive. However, my focus as energy modeler is energy, and not comfort, system complexity or reliability. Regardless, the exact sequence of operations, even if meticulously described in the design documents, may not be implemented, or may be changed many times during the first year or two of building operation.

*         No/poor commissioning of buildings. Buildings designed to be very energy efficient often rely on complex controls for HVAC and lighting systems. Many buildings are not commissioned, and even in the ones that are, commissioning is often little more than verifying that the equipment and controls were installed as designed. The commissioning agent rarely has the time/budget/scope to determine that all control strategies are operating as designed. Also, the commissioning agent cannot change the weather conditions during which the building is commissioned, making it next to impossible to check CHW controls during winter for example.

*         New buildings often go through many changes in operating conditions during their first year or two. New buildings are often in use after hours due to people moving into their new offices, or because they are nice facilities and the demand to utilize them is high.

*         One of the best ways to predict energy performance is data mining of existing building performance. Hopefully, CBECS and other building performance databases will be a big area of focus for our field.

Hi, 

We use eQuest for our energy models. Now, we have to simulate a natural
ventilation for garage to fulfill the requirements for IEQp1.

I have read that we can use Energy plus or LoopDA. But, I need to know the
characteristics of the simulation: temperature, wind, number of simulation,
exteriors parameters


What is the recommended practice for this simulation?

 

Thanks in advance,

In the ESPC or ESCO world, where performance must be depended upon to achieve financial returns, there are understood and controlling processes in what equipment is bought, how it is installed, how it is maintained, how it is operated and expected duty schedule. Contracts are written to reduce uncertainty to the point that in some cases any deviance, in seemly minor matters, throws the performance expectations up for renegotiations.

While weather changes can be adjusted for after the fact (and thus readily understood as a reason for some differences between real and modeled performance), outside of the ESPC/ESCO arena, a design engineer/modeler can make their best fine tuned efforts on construction intent equipment and operations, to be undone by changes in installation, commissioning, operational practices and occupancy that are not under their control, and are frequently difficult to document after the fact.

In the design arena, modeling is a means to assess options on a level plane, and should not be offered as a predictor of actual cost unless that risk is fully evaluated and compensated for (both in labor/risk fees and in the processes to assure changes are documented). There is a real need to fully vet an industry standard approach to identifying the risks (for fair negotiation), and establishing standards in best practices.

Yes, our modeling does inform sequences of operations, as strategies can be involved, and are a combined designer and modeler effort. They do indeed make their way into construction intent documents ... but implementation and ongoing maintenance are another matter.

A calibrated model is an excellent tool for more realistically evaluating operational and systems changes. But here too, the results should be considered as a way to evaluate options on a level playing field, as control over so many variables is out of the modelers scope.

I would encourage the development of collective industry guidance towards understanding these risks and offering clarification on expectations for client informational purposes.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] ASHRAE 2012 Energy Modeling Conference Topic for Discussion

Jim said most of what I was going to say. Additionally,

*         An energy modeler's task for a new construction project is rarely to accurately predict energy use, but to demonstrate compliance with, and improvement over, code performance.

*         Modelers generally do not fine tune plug loads, occupant numbers and schedules etc. because these are kept identical for determining improved performance over code.

*         Sequence of operations. The modeler is usually not the engineer of record, and should therefore not be dictating the sequence of operations of HVAC/plant equipment. I may provide the mechanical engineer with suggestions on controls strategies and setpoints, and sometimes they are receptive. However, my focus as energy modeler is energy, and not comfort, system complexity or reliability. Regardless, the exact sequence of operations, even if meticulously described in the design documents, may not be implemented, or may be changed many times during the first year or two of building operation.

*         No/poor commissioning of buildings. Buildings designed to be very energy efficient often rely on complex controls for HVAC and lighting systems. Many buildings are not commissioned, and even in the ones that are, commissioning is often little more than verifying that the equipment and controls were installed as designed. The commissioning agent rarely has the time/budget/scope to determine that all control strategies are operating as designed. Also, the commissioning agent cannot change the weather conditions during which the building is commissioned, making it next to impossible to check CHW controls during winter for example.

*         New buildings often go through many changes in operating conditions during their first year or two. New buildings are often in use after hours due to people moving into their new offices, or because they are nice facilities and the demand to utilize them is high.

*         One of the best ways to predict energy performance is data mining of existing building performance. Hopefully, CBECS and other building performance databases will be a big area of focus for our field.

Dear Dennis and BldgSim Community,

1.       I think the tools are absolutely up to the task.  My own practice uses EnergyPlus exclusively, but I know that most of the other tools are based in solid thermodynamic and physical principles - so they start on a solid foundation.

2.       Current best practices is another story altogether!

a.       Keeping in mind that I know only the "Best practices" for my own firm ...

b.      Energy modelers of new construction are normally given scant information.

*   Partly this is due to the owner not knowing exactly how the new facility will be used.

*   Partly this is due to the Owner and Designer not caring about, not appreciating the importance of, or just not needing to gather detailed information about the operation of a building that hasn't been built.

*   Partly it's because "as built" is never "as designed". (Think of fan and pump pressure estimates differing from actual, weather variances, occupancy schedule changes, etc.)

*   The energy modeling community has, it seems, a lot of bright young men and women who are "learning the ropes".  The fact that they are becoming involved is very exciting!  Their education must be broadened, however, in order for them to become effective at modeling existing buildings. It's no longer just theory;  there is a lot of practical, "hands on" activity that is needed.

3.       Inferred above is the host of variables that differ in an actual building's operation from what may have been assumed.  The older the building, the more variations there are!

4.       Most building operators, if they exist within the building as a full time position, are distracted with many other details and spent precious little time optimizing energy performance.  If there is no full time building operator .....

5.       This is a field ripe with opportunity!  The first and hardest task, I think, is to get building owners convinced that the ROI for optimal building performance is better than any of their other opportunities for investing.  The next task is to streamline the process of calibration and identification of opportunities so that they is faster and more economical.

6.       ... and I'd love to expand this discussion during the Q&A period at my presentation on this topic during the ASHRAE Energy Modeling Conference!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] ASHRAE 2012 Energy Modeling Conference Topic for Discussion

I am the Chair of the conference committee for the ASHRAE 2012 Energy Modeling Conference that will be held in Atlanta on October 1, 2 & 3 this year (see link below).  The conference is focused on bringing practitioners, software developers, researchers and facility users together for 3 days of in depth discussion on current modeling software capabilities and current best practices in energy modeling.  I have two questions that I would like to pose to this group to get some feedback to help provider richer content for the discussions planned at the conference;
1. Are the current energy modeling tools available to an energy modeling practitioner reliable enough to allow the modeler to predict a building's actual energy consumption with a high degree of confidence such that an accurate energy target can be established and recommended to the building owner for the new building or a  renovation/retrofit?
2. Are the current best practices of the energy modeling community reliable enough, and well understood by most practitioners, to allow the modeler to predict a building's actual energy consumption with a high degree of confidence such that an accurate energy target can be established and recommended to the building owner for the new building or a renovation/retrofit?

Background for the discussion:
These questions recently came up in a discussion among the conference committee.  It seems that one our colleagues from the UK indicated that in the UK new schools have performed very poorly in comparison with their predicted energy use.

Another comment that was made was as follows:
"Often a building's actual energy consumption is 1.5 to 2 times as much as the results of an energy model that was used to make decisions during design about the building's energy using systems.  Is it the the energy modeling tools or is it the processes used by energy modelers to describe the systems and how they operate in the software? Should energy models be used to "predict" a building's future energy performance or just be used to inform better decisions during design?

I have reviewed a good many models and, almost without fail, I never see a modeler start by writing a sequence of operation and I also never see the sequence of operation used by the modeler make its way into a set of construction documents.

Also, when I am the modeler and I am "calibrating" a model to an existing building's actual energy consumption it is a very iterative process.  I know what things to manipulate in the model to effect demand and what things to manipulate to effect consumption.  I just keep going back and forth until I have a model that you can almost lay its output on top of the building's utility bill history. I also have a good understanding of how the building is actually being operated and maintained - which I hope helps make the model more accurate, but, does that process really give me a better model to make decisions from?"


I invite everyone to please, tell us what you think.
Sincerely,

The key is to not use energy models quantitatively. Energy models should generally be used qualitatively to compare to either a known benchmark (utility bills for existing buildings etc.) or a baseline (regional energy codes for new buildings, etc.). For comparisons to utility bills we often model control sequences and other known occupant/owner/operator behavior.

After enjoying all of the posts on this topic, it occurs to me that existing energy modeling software is challenged to model certain aspects of building operation that are ?broken?. An example might be a chilled or hot water valve which never closes fully.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] ASHRAE 2012 Energy Modeling Conference Topic for Discussion

Jim said most of what I was going to say. Additionally,

?         An energy modeler?s task for a new construction project is rarely to accurately predict energy use, but to demonstrate compliance with, and improvement over, code performance.

?         Modelers generally do not fine tune plug loads, occupant numbers and schedules etc. because these are kept identical for determining improved performance over code.

?         Sequence of operations. The modeler is usually not the engineer of record, and should therefore not be dictating the sequence of operations of HVAC/plant equipment. I may provide the mechanical engineer with suggestions on controls strategies and setpoints, and sometimes they are receptive. However, my focus as energy modeler is energy, and not comfort, system complexity or reliability. Regardless, the exact sequence of operations, even if meticulously described in the design documents, may not be implemented, or may be changed many times during the first year or two of building operation.

?         No/poor commissioning of buildings. Buildings designed to be very energy efficient often rely on complex controls for HVAC and lighting systems. Many buildings are not commissioned, and even in the ones that are, commissioning is often little more than verifying that the equipment and controls were installed as designed. The commissioning agent rarely has the time/budget/scope to determine that all control strategies are operating as designed. Also, the commissioning agent cannot change the weather conditions during which the building is commissioned, making it next to impossible to check CHW controls during winter for example.

?         New buildings often go through many changes in operating conditions during their first year or two. New buildings are often in use after hours due to people moving into their new offices, or because they are nice facilities and the demand to utilize them is high.

?         One of the best ways to predict energy performance is data mining of existing building performance. Hopefully, CBECS and other building performance databases will be a big area of focus for our field.

Dear Dennis and BldgSim Community,

1.      I think the tools are absolutely up to the task.  My own practice uses EnergyPlus exclusively, but I know that most of the other tools are based in solid thermodynamic and physical principles ? so they start on a solid foundation.

2.      Current best practices is another story altogether!

a.       Keeping in mind that I know only the ?Best practices? for my own firm ?

b.      Energy modelers of new construction are normally given scant information.

?   Partly this is due to the owner not knowing exactly how the new facility will be used.

?   Partly this is due to the Owner and Designer not caring about, not appreciating the importance of, or just not needing to gather detailed information about the operation of a building that hasn?t been built.

?   Partly it?s because ?as built? is never ?as designed?. (Think of fan and pump pressure estimates differing from actual, weather variances, occupancy schedule changes, etc.)

?   The energy modeling community has, it seems, a lot of bright young men and women who are ?learning the ropes?.  The fact that they are becoming involved is very exciting!  Their education must be broadened, however, in order for them to become effective at modeling existing buildings. It?s no longer just theory;  there is a lot of practical, ?hands on? activity that is needed.

3.      Inferred above is the host of variables that differ in an actual building?s operation from what may have been assumed.  The older the building, the more variations there are!

4.      Most building operators, if they exist within the building as a full time position, are distracted with many other details and spent precious little time optimizing energy performance.  If there is no full time building operator ?..

5.      This is a field ripe with opportunity!  The first and hardest task, I think, is to get building owners convinced that the ROI for optimal building performance is better than any of their other opportunities for investing.  The next task is to streamline the process of calibration and identification of opportunities so that they is faster and more economical.

6.      ? and I?d love to expand this discussion during the Q&A period at my presentation on this topic during the ASHRAE Energy Modeling Conference!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] ASHRAE 2012 Energy Modeling Conference Topic for Discussion

I am the Chair of the conference committee for the ASHRAE 2012 Energy Modeling Conference that will be held in Atlanta on October 1, 2 & 3 this year (see link below).  The conference is focused on bringing practitioners, software developers, researchers and facility users together for 3 days of in depth discussion on current modeling software capabilities and current best practices in energy modeling.  I have two questions that I would like to pose to this group to get some feedback to help provider richer content for the discussions planned at the conference;
1. Are the current energy modeling tools available to an energy modeling practitioner reliable enough to allow the modeler to predict a building's actual energy consumption with a high degree of confidence such that an accurate energy target can be established and recommended to the building owner for the new building or a  renovation/retrofit?
2. Are the current best practices of the energy modeling community reliable enough, and well understood by most practitioners, to allow the modeler to predict a building's actual energy consumption with a high degree of confidence such that an accurate energy target can be established and recommended to the building owner for the new building or a renovation/retrofit?

Background for the discussion:
These questions recently came up in a discussion among the conference committee.  It seems that one our colleagues from the UK indicated that in the UK new schools have performed very poorly in comparison with their predicted energy use.

Another comment that was made was as follows:
"Often a building's actual energy consumption is 1.5 to 2 times as much as the results of an energy model that was used to make decisions during design about the building's energy using systems.  Is it the the energy modeling tools or is it the processes used by energy modelers to describe the systems and how they operate in the software? Should energy models be used to "predict" a building's future energy performance or just be used to inform better decisions during design?

I have reviewed a good many models and, almost without fail, I never see a modeler start by writing a sequence of operation and I also never see the sequence of operation used by the modeler make its way into a set of construction documents.

Also, when I am the modeler and I am "calibrating" a model to an existing building's actual energy consumption it is a very iterative process.  I know what things to manipulate in the model to effect demand and what things to manipulate to effect consumption.  I just keep going back and forth until I have a model that you can almost lay its output on top of the building's utility bill history. I also have a good understanding of how the building is actually being operated and maintained - which I hope helps make the model more accurate, but, does that process really give me a better model to make decisions from?"


I invite everyone to please, tell us what you think.
Sincerely,

How about modelling an uninsulated condenser cooling water line that 
runs through the building outside the insulation on the South side of 
the building in California?

This is a timely issue to be raised. I appreciate David Ellis' overview. As
he states, the industry expects the need for adjustments/corrections to
verified savings models so the same should nominally be expected for
whole-building simulation models developed to inform design decision.

During the RMI Building Energy Modeling Summit (
http://www.rmi.org/ReportsBEMInnovationSummit), the Methods & Processes
break-out group came to agree that part of the modeling credibility
challenge could be managed by addressing owner's expectations. We
determined that modeling was performed for one of three objectives - 1) for
making performance comparisons (e.g. comparing design options), 2)
demonstrating compliance (e.g. LEED baseline or code) or 3) predicting
performance. Depending on the objective, the level of effort and associated
costs are different (as others have acknowledged on this email chain). The
owner and statement of work need to recognize these differences. And as
others have pointed out, a building simulation model assumes ideal
conditions. It can be used to benchmark actual operation against and detect
operational issues. But it can't be expected to reflect conditions other
than those assumed in the model.

Inspired by the work plan developed by the Methods & Processes break out
group (see link for final report and work plan), I submitted a proposal to
DOE to complete work in line with what David proposed for the industry. We
are just getting it underway. We refer to it as the Building Energy
Modeling Library or Modeling for Investor Confidence. While this is a broad
area, we are starting by structuring and documenting modeling best practice
procedures to facilitate their use in modeling guidelines, standards,
scopes of work etc. As much as possible, we aim to include risk
assessment/management into the methods. Once developed, the methods will be
posted on the internet. I'll share our progress as we go with the
list-serve.

I also recently co-authored a paper on risked-based building energy
modeling, which provides a pretty good overview and some new ideas to
support the topic. If anyone is interested to read it. let me know and I'll
email you a copy.

Best regards,
Ellen.

Hi Apeksha,

 

You can model the basic characteristics of an air-source heat pump in simple
HVAC using UK NCM data. There is a simple HVAC tutorial available on
DesignBuilder's website which describes the basic set-up and features of
simple HVAC. Assuming you want heating-only:

 

1.       Go to the HVAC tab, select 'known HVAC system' and edit the details
as below.

2.       Set the system type e.g. central heating using radiators or
underfloor heating etc.

3.       In the heating tab set the heat source to heat pump: air source
(note different fuel types available).

4.       Input the basic performance parameters in the remaining tabs.

 

If you have both heating and cooling use the split or multi-split system
type and enter the heating details as above.

 

Regards,

 

Dave

Apeksha,

 

Apologies for my earlier email (an early-morning response J)...I've just
realised I've been using the UK compliance version of DesignBuilder for the
last week so my response was based on the SBEM analysis interface not
EnergyPlus. 

 

To approximately model a heat pump using Simple HVAC in DesignBuilder using
EnergyPlus as the calculation engine (the limitations of simple HVAC are
discussed in the help file and tutorial):



1.       Set the closest HVAC template for the system type (under floor
heating system, radiators with natvent etc).

2.       Set the auxiliary energy (or in the absence of accurate data use
the NCM auxiliary energy setting in model options to use the default NCM
value).

3.       Set the heating fuel type (presumably grid electricity) and the
heating system CoP to an appropriate value.

4.       Change the radiant details under the 'Type' header if necessary.

Hi Apeksha,

 

You can model the basic characteristics of an air-source heat pump in simple
HVAC using UK NCM data. There is a simple HVAC tutorial available on
DesignBuilder's website which describes the basic set-up and features of
simple HVAC. Assuming you want heating-only:

 

1.       Go to the HVAC tab, select 'known HVAC system' and edit the details
as below.

2.       Set the system type e.g. central heating using radiators or
underfloor heating etc.

3.       In the heating tab set the heat source to heat pump: air source
(note different fuel types available).

4.       Input the basic performance parameters in the remaining tabs.

 

If you have both heating and cooling use the split or multi-split system
type and enter the heating details as above.

 

Regards,

 

Dave

Hi All,

I'm trying to model a house in Designbuilder heated through an air-source
heat pump. The output I'm after is only the monthly and annual energy
consumption and heating load. Does anyone know which HVAC template to use
for this. I do have the Designbuilder v3 version that can do detailed HVAC
but I'm not after a detailed heat pump design. Any guidance on how to model
heat pumps in simple/compact HVAC in Designbuilder will be useful.

 

Many thanks,

Hi all. I'd like to echo Jim's comment, and express excitement about what RMI is doing. Related to the "reality factor," I've seen a tremendous gap between what LEED/GBCI wants and what will actually take place in the building, and the lack of sanity checks in modeling software. Though it is the responsibility of the modeler to perform sanity checks, and quality control, just spending the extra couple of hours each project can make the world of difference. On that end I've created a slew of my own sanity-check post-processing tools for eQuest and feel like our deliverables have improved significantly as a result.

What some of the data our clients are sharing has begun to express the overwhelming need for these checks in all modeling, which includes analyses I've reviewed on behalf of our clients. In recent projects I've gone so far as to assume building-user error, reflected in schedules and temperatures, which has been spot on when comparing to metered data. This is somewhat taboo, because not many people are likely to voice these foreseeable shortcomings when delivering EUI's during design that look inflated, for a new "high performance" building, but as sanity checks and associated tools develop it may become easier.

What we can do, as an industry, is get better at setting expectations parallel to educating the building community about the usefulness/value of a good model.

Great thread folks.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] ASHRAE 2012 Energy Modeling Conference Topic for Discussion

This is a timely issue to be raised. I appreciate David Ellis' overview. As he states, the industry expects the need for adjustments/corrections to verified savings models so the same should nominally be expected for whole-building simulation models developed to inform design decision.

During the RMI Building Energy Modeling Summit (http://www.rmi.org/ReportsBEMInnovationSummit), the Methods & Processes break-out group came to agree that part of the modeling credibility challenge could be managed by addressing owner's expectations. We determined that modeling was performed for one of three objectives - 1) for making performance comparisons (e.g. comparing design options), 2) demonstrating compliance (e.g. LEED baseline or code) or 3) predicting performance. Depending on the objective, the level of effort and associated costs are different (as others have acknowledged on this email chain). The owner and statement of work need to recognize these differences. And as others have pointed out, a building simulation model assumes ideal conditions. It can be used to benchmark actual operation against and detect operational issues. But it can't be expected to reflect conditions other than those assumed in the model.

Inspired by the work plan developed by the Methods & Processes break out group (see link for final report and work plan), I submitted a proposal to DOE to complete work in line with what David proposed for the industry. We are just getting it underway. We refer to it as the Building Energy Modeling Library or Modeling for Investor Confidence. While this is a broad area, we are starting by structuring and documenting modeling best practice procedures to facilitate their use in modeling guidelines, standards, scopes of work etc. As much as possible, we aim to include risk assessment/management into the methods. Once developed, the methods will be posted on the internet. I'll share our progress as we go with the list-serve.

I also recently co-authored a paper on risked-based building energy modeling, which provides a pretty good overview and some new ideas to support the topic. If anyone is interested to read it. let me know and I'll email you a copy.

Best regards,
Ellen.

Bill, Jim, Dennis, et al

This is a tough nut. In the ESPC or ESCO world, where performance must be depended upon to achieve financial returns, there are understood and controlling processes in what equipment is bought, how it is installed, how it is maintained, how it is operated and expected duty schedule. Contracts are written to reduce uncertainty to the point that in some cases any deviance, in seemly minor matters, throws the performance expectations up for renegotiations.

While weather changes can be adjusted for after the fact (and thus readily understood as a reason for some differences between real and modeled performance), outside of the ESPC/ESCO arena, a design engineer/modeler can make their best fine tuned efforts on construction intent equipment and operations, to be undone by changes in installation, commissioning, operational practices and occupancy that are not under their control, and are frequently difficult to document after the fact.

In the design arena, modeling is a means to assess options on a level plane, and should not be offered as a predictor of actual cost unless that risk is fully evaluated and compensated for (both in labor/risk fees and in the processes to assure changes are documented). There is a real need to fully vet an industry standard approach to identifying the risks (for fair negotiation), and establishing standards in best practices.

Yes, our modeling does inform sequences of operations, as strategies can be involved, and are a combined designer and modeler effort. They do indeed make their way into construction intent documents ... but implementation and ongoing maintenance are another matter.

A calibrated model is an excellent tool for more realistically evaluating operational and systems changes. But here too, the results should be considered as a way to evaluate options on a level playing field, as control over so many variables is out of the modelers scope.

I would encourage the development of collective industry guidance towards understanding these risks and offering clarification on expectations for client informational purposes.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] ASHRAE 2012 Energy Modeling Conference Topic for Discussion

Jim said most of what I was going to say. Additionally,

*         An energy modeler's task for a new construction project is rarely to accurately predict energy use, but to demonstrate compliance with, and improvement over, code performance.

*         Modelers generally do not fine tune plug loads, occupant numbers and schedules etc. because these are kept identical for determining improved performance over code.

*         Sequence of operations. The modeler is usually not the engineer of record, and should therefore not be dictating the sequence of operations of HVAC/plant equipment. I may provide the mechanical engineer with suggestions on controls strategies and setpoints, and sometimes they are receptive. However, my focus as energy modeler is energy, and not comfort, system complexity or reliability. Regardless, the exact sequence of operations, even if meticulously described in the design documents, may not be implemented, or may be changed many times during the first year or two of building operation.

*         No/poor commissioning of buildings. Buildings designed to be very energy efficient often rely on complex controls for HVAC and lighting systems. Many buildings are not commissioned, and even in the ones that are, commissioning is often little more than verifying that the equipment and controls were installed as designed. The commissioning agent rarely has the time/budget/scope to determine that all control strategies are operating as designed. Also, the commissioning agent cannot change the weather conditions during which the building is commissioned, making it next to impossible to check CHW controls during winter for example.

*         New buildings often go through many changes in operating conditions during their first year or two. New buildings are often in use after hours due to people moving into their new offices, or because they are nice facilities and the demand to utilize them is high.

*         One of the best ways to predict energy performance is data mining of existing building performance. Hopefully, CBECS and other building performance databases will be a big area of focus for our field.

Dear Dennis and BldgSim Community,<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>

1.       I think the tools are absolutely up to the task.  My own practice uses EnergyPlus exclusively, but I know that most of the other tools are based in solid thermodynamic and physical principles - so they start on a solid foundation.<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>

2.       Current best practices is another story altogether!<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>

a.       Keeping in mind that I know only the "Best practices" for my own firm ...<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>

b.      Energy modelers of new construction are normally given scant information.  <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>

*   Partly this is due to the owner not knowing exactly how the new facility will be used.<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>

*   Partly this is due to the Owner and Designer not caring about, not appreciating the importance of, or just not needing to gather detailed information about the operation of a building that hasn't been built.<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>

*   Partly it's because "as built" is never "as designed". (Think of fan and pump pressure estimates differing from actual, weather variances, occupancy schedule changes, etc.)<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>

*   The energy modeling community has, it seems, a lot of bright young men and women who are "learning the ropes".  The fact that they are becoming involved is very exciting!  Their education must be broadened, however, in order for them to become effective at modeling existing buildings. It's no longer just theory;  there is a lot of practical, "hands on" activity that is needed.<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>

3.       Inferred above is the host of variables that differ in an actual building's operation from what may have been assumed.  The older the building, the more variations there are!<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>

4.       Most building operators, if they exist within the building as a full time position, are distracted with many other details and spent precious little time optimizing energy performance.  If there is no full time building operator .....<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>

5.       This is a field ripe with opportunity!  The first and hardest task, I think, is to get building owners convinced that the ROI for optimal building performance is better than any of their other opportunities for investing.  The next task is to streamline the process of calibration and identification of opportunities so that they is faster and more economical.<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>

I am the Chair of the conference committee for the ASHRAE 2012 Energy Modeling Conference that will be held in Atlanta on October 1, 2 & 3 this year (see link below).  The conference is focused on bringing practitioners, software developers, researchers and facility users together for 3 days of in depth discussion on current modeling software capabilities and current best practices in energy modeling.  I have two questions that I would like to pose to this group to get some feedback to help provider richer content for the discussions planned at the conference;<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>
1. Are the current energy modeling tools available to an energy modeling practitioner reliable enough to allow the modeler to predict a building's actual energy consumption with a high degree of confidence such that an accurate energy target can be established and recommended to the building owner for the new building or a  renovation/retrofit? <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>
2. Are the current best practices of the energy modeling community reliable enough, and well understood by most practitioners, to allow the modeler to predict a building's actual energy consumption with a high degree of confidence such that an accurate energy target can be established and recommended to the building owner for the new building or a renovation/retrofit? <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>
 <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>
Background for the discussion:<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>
These questions recently came up in a discussion among the conference committee.  It seems that one our colleagues from the UK indicated that in the UK new schools have performed very poorly in comparison with their predicted energy use.<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>
 <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>
Another comment that was made was as follows:<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>
"Often a building's actual energy consumption is 1.5 to 2 times as much as the results of an energy model that was used to make decisions during design about the building's energy using systems.  Is it the the energy modeling tools or is it the processes used by energy modelers to describe the systems and how they operate in the software? Should energy models be used to "predict" a building's future energy performance or just be used to inform better decisions during design?<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>
 <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>
I have reviewed a good many models and, almost without fail, I never see a modeler start by writing a sequence of operation and I also never see the sequence of operation used by the modeler make its way into a set of construction documents.  <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>
 <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>
Also, when I am the modeler and I am "calibrating" a model to an existing building's actual energy consumption it is a very iterative process.  I know what things to manipulate in the model to effect demand and what things to manipulate to effect consumption.  I just keep going back and forth until I have a model that you can almost lay its output on top of the building's utility bill history. I also have a good understanding of how the building is actually being operated and maintained - which I hope helps make the model more accurate, but, does that process really give me a better model to make decisions from?"<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>

Two things:

1.  Some modeling software has lots of controls built into default HVAC
system types.  These controls are often better than what is planned or
installed for the building.  For example: economizers, demand controlled
ventilation or outdoor air reset might be assumed.  Similarly, on many
projects the HVAC controls drawings or sequence of operation is either
missing or not useful at all.  Without good information, it's tempting as a
modeler to assume efficient control of equipment.  However, on the actual
building, the opposite is likely to happen.

2.  Once I account for usage patterns, if a building I modeled during
design performs poorly in comparison to my model, I generally view at as
the building's "fault", and not the fault of my model.  The model can be a
great diagnostic tool for discovering where/how the building is not
operating as was modeled.  With a cooperative engineer and facilities
manager, we can usually make adjustments in building controls to bring the
building more closely in line with the model.  If the building was not
insulated properly, that is another matter, and post-occupancy adjustments
are difficult/impossible to make.  However, I would argue that the solution
is not to model poor construction and execution, but try to find a way to
use the model's projected energy data to keep the energy target in sight
through construction.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Mixed-Use project with multiple meters - Match Proposed
	or Reality?
Message-ID: <CAMXhxQUU35DMrwNEOHLmWobQ6g_GPEi2c8=BqmbcaTiDeApanA@mail.gmail.com>

I have a multifamily project which will have a noresidential electricity
meter to cover house loads and a residential electrical meter for each
unit.  The baseline system is System 2 - PTHP's.  The proposed system is
Chilled Water with Electric Heat.  Due to the rate structures out here in
Seattle, I'm noticing that the virtual rate in the baseline is
approximately 10% higher than in the proposed.  I've tracked it down mainly
to the fact that the baseline "Space Cooling" usage is allocated to the
Residential meters while the Proposed "Space Cooling" is provided by a
chiller that will be on a nonresidential meter.  In reality, a terminal
piece of equipment within a residence would be metered by the residential
panel and charged direct to the residence.  However, it seems a bit unfair
that the baseline is being penalized strictly based on which meter the
"Space Cooling" is assigned to.

I can't find anything specifically within Appendix G that would tell me to
have the same energy meters or rate structure by system.  The LEED
Reference Guide provides guidance that says the same rate schedules shall
be used for the proposed and baseline simulations and building.

Mixed-use buildings seem to be a weak point of Appendix G and I'm wondering
if anyone else has run into this issue before.

Thanks,

Hello,



There are lots of interesting threads on this conversation. However, I think that there are also some misconceptions.



First, model as you will for new construction, at best, in my opinion, you are performing a rating of the building's assets compared against a standard, much like the mileage ratings on a car that you purchase. If you are using the IECC, 90.1, 189 or the IGCC, you have to use specific rules to guide the input of internal heat gains, etc. Such rules have been carefully crafted to avoid gaming and to attempt to deliver the same result regardless of who performs the simulation.



Therefore, it is my opinion that such a simulated asset rating of a building should not be construed to match the actual energy use of the building (period). If does happen to match the actual energy use, then a miracle has just taken place because the probability of this not happening is large.



Second, if you do attempt to match the energy use of a real building, there is advice about how to go about this in the literature, including the results of many ASHRAE projects, for example: RP827 for in situ equipment, RP 1404 (ongoing) for how to use short term/long term measurements to match a real building, RP1051 for advice about overall calibrations, RP1052 for advice on AHU modeling, RP1004 for advice on thermal storage modeling, RP865 for advice on secondary system modeling, and soon RP1468 for advice about modeling and BIM to thermal. So, there's hope that one can actually match a real building, if you have measured data and if you have real systems that match your model's systems, and if you have real weather data and if you have a large budget and tons of patience, etc., etc. Otherwise, getting a "match" is really an exercise of "matching lumps" against "measured lumps".



Third, don't ever forget that simulations of building envelopes are just great big R-C networks, and when you attach a system simulation to this you are perhaps adding a bit of psychrometrics, and then a bunch of curve fits since most widely used programs do not have first principle models of their chillers, boilers, etc., just curve fits.



Fourth, whole-building simulations do a really bad job of simulating faults or broken systems. For

example, when a building is badly zoned (i.e., the thermostat and zoning was wrong from the building and parts of the building are always too cold or too hot, etc.). In such cases, you can't simulate it very well. In other cases, where valves are broken and/or the building has weird controls -- best of luck.



Fifth, simulations of building envelopes is still REALLY CRUDE. For example, simulation programs have no wall thickness. Think about it. The wall is just a thin 2D construct with the thickness only accounted for in the material definition. Hence, to get it right, a simulator has to ?setback? the windows, since most windows are located midway in the wall and have a small 2 to 3 inch shade from the overhang of the lintel. Or consider that simulations do not consider the corners of buildings, just the area of the wall. So, you?ve got lots of corners in your building you might need to compensate.



Sixth, shaded windows in the DOE-2 family of codes use George Walton?s algorithm to assign the calculation point for the shading. This has 10 divisions by default, it splits the window in half vertically, then each half into fifths?or if you choose 20, 30?up to 40 it keeps going. For most rectangular windows this doesn?t make a difference, but for a shaded, curved window in elevation, to get the most accurate results, you end up with a bit of a quilt-looking window ? no kidding. RP1468 (forthcoming) will shed some light on items 5 and 6.



So, before we make claims about how to do things better, we need to remember just how rough we are REALLY doing them now (actually it?s can be pretty good), and then choose our words carefully when we make claims about what is being simulated ? I?m just as guilty of this as anybody.

Two things:

1.  Some modeling software has lots of controls built into default HVAC system types.  These controls are often better than what is planned or installed for the building.  For example: economizers, demand controlled ventilation or outdoor air reset might be assumed.  Similarly, on many projects the HVAC controls drawings or sequence of operation is either missing or not useful at all.  Without good information, it's tempting as a modeler to assume efficient control of equipment.  However, on the actual building, the opposite is likely to happen.

2.  Once I account for usage patterns, if a building I modeled during design performs poorly in comparison to my model, I generally view at as the building's "fault", and not the fault of my model.  The model can be a great diagnostic tool for discovering where/how the building is not operating as was modeled.  With a cooperative engineer and facilities manager, we can usually make adjustments in building controls to bring the building more closely in line with the model.  If the building was not insulated properly, that is another matter, and post-occupancy adjustments are difficult/impossible to make.  However, I would argue that the solution is not to model poor construction and execution, but try to find a way to use the model's projected energy data to keep the energy target in sight through construction.

Hi all. I?d like to echo Jim?s comment, and express excitement about what RMI is doing. Related to the ?reality factor,? I?ve seen a tremendous gap between what LEED/GBCI wants and what will actually take place in the building, and the lack of sanity checks in modeling software. Though it is the responsibility of the modeler to perform sanity checks, and quality control, just spending the extra couple of hours each project can make the world of difference. On that end I?ve created a slew of my own sanity-check post-processing tools for eQuest and feel like our deliverables have improved significantly as a result.

What some of the data our clients are sharing has begun to express the overwhelming need for these checks in all modeling, which includes analyses I?ve reviewed on behalf of our clients. In recent projects I?ve gone so far as to assume building-user error, reflected in schedules and temperatures, which has been spot on when comparing to metered data. This is somewhat taboo, because not many people are likely to voice these foreseeable shortcomings when delivering EUI?s during design that look inflated, for a new ?high performance? building, but as sanity checks and associated tools develop it may become easier.

What we can do, as an industry, is get better at setting expectations parallel to educating the building community about the usefulness/value of a good model.

Great thread folks.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] ASHRAE 2012 Energy Modeling Conference Topic for Discussion

This is a timely issue to be raised. I appreciate David Ellis' overview. As he states, the industry expects the need for adjustments/corrections to verified savings models so the same should nominally be expected for whole-building simulation models developed to inform design decision.

During the RMI Building Energy Modeling Summit (http://www.rmi.org/ReportsBEMInnovationSummit), the Methods & Processes break-out group came to agree that part of the modeling credibility challenge could be managed by addressing owner's expectations. We determined that modeling was performed for one of three objectives - 1) for making performance comparisons (e.g. comparing design options), 2) demonstrating compliance (e.g. LEED baseline or code) or 3) predicting performance. Depending on the objective, the level of effort and associated costs are different (as others have acknowledged on this email chain). The owner and statement of work need to recognize these differences. And as others have pointed out, a building simulation model assumes ideal conditions. It can be used to benchmark actual operation against and detect operational issues. But it can't be expected to reflect conditions other than those assumed in the model.

Inspired by the work plan developed by the Methods & Processes break out group (see link for final report and work plan), I submitted a proposal to DOE to complete work in line with what David proposed for the industry. We are just getting it underway. We refer to it as the Building Energy Modeling Library or Modeling for Investor Confidence. While this is a broad area, we are starting by structuring and documenting modeling best practice procedures to facilitate their use in modeling guidelines, standards, scopes of work etc. As much as possible, we aim to include risk assessment/management into the methods. Once developed, the methods will be posted on the internet. I'll share our progress as we go with the list-serve.

I also recently co-authored a paper on risked-based building energy modeling, which provides a pretty good overview and some new ideas to support the topic. If anyone is interested to read it. let me know and I'll email you a copy.

Best regards,
Ellen.

Bill, Jim, Dennis, et al

This is a tough nut. In the ESPC or ESCO world, where performance must be depended upon to achieve financial returns, there are understood and controlling processes in what equipment is bought, how it is installed, how it is maintained, how it is operated and expected duty schedule. Contracts are written to reduce uncertainty to the point that in some cases any deviance, in seemly minor matters, throws the performance expectations up for renegotiations.

While weather changes can be adjusted for after the fact (and thus readily understood as a reason for some differences between real and modeled performance), outside of the ESPC/ESCO arena, a design engineer/modeler can make their best fine tuned efforts on construction intent equipment and operations, to be undone by changes in installation, commissioning, operational practices and occupancy that are not under their control, and are frequently difficult to document after the fact.

In the design arena, modeling is a means to assess options on a level plane, and should not be offered as a predictor of actual cost unless that risk is fully evaluated and compensated for (both in labor/risk fees and in the processes to assure changes are documented). There is a real need to fully vet an industry standard approach to identifying the risks (for fair negotiation), and establishing standards in best practices.

Yes, our modeling does inform sequences of operations, as strategies can be involved, and are a combined designer and modeler effort. They do indeed make their way into construction intent documents ? but implementation and ongoing maintenance are another matter.

A calibrated model is an excellent tool for more realistically evaluating operational and systems changes. But here too, the results should be considered as a way to evaluate options on a level playing field, as control over so many variables is out of the modelers scope.

I would encourage the development of collective industry guidance towards understanding these risks and offering clarification on expectations for client informational purposes.

Jim said most of what I was going to say. Additionally,

?         An energy modeler?s task for a new construction project is rarely to accurately predict energy use, but to demonstrate compliance with, and improvement over, code performance.

?         Modelers generally do not fine tune plug loads, occupant numbers and schedules etc. because these are kept identical for determining improved performance over code.

?         Sequence of operations. The modeler is usually not the engineer of record, and should therefore not be dictating the sequence of operations of HVAC/plant equipment. I may provide the mechanical engineer with suggestions on controls strategies and setpoints, and sometimes they are receptive. However, my focus as energy modeler is energy, and not comfort, system complexity or reliability. Regardless, the exact sequence of operations, even if meticulously described in the design documents, may not be implemented, or may be changed many times during the first year or two of building operation.

?         No/poor commissioning of buildings. Buildings designed to be very energy efficient often rely on complex controls for HVAC and lighting systems. Many buildings are not commissioned, and even in the ones that are, commissioning is often little more than verifying that the equipment and controls were installed as designed. The commissioning agent rarely has the time/budget/scope to determine that all control strategies are operating as designed. Also, the commissioning agent cannot change the weather conditions during which the building is commissioned, making it next to impossible to check CHW controls during winter for example.

?         New buildings often go through many changes in operating conditions during their first year or two. New buildings are often in use after hours due to people moving into their new offices, or because they are nice facilities and the demand to utilize them is high.

?         One of the best ways to predict energy performance is data mining of existing building performance. Hopefully, CBECS and other building performance databases will be a big area of focus for our field.

Dear Dennis and BldgSim Community,<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>

1.       I think the tools are absolutely up to the task.  My own practice uses EnergyPlus exclusively, but I know that most of the other tools are based in solid thermodynamic and physical principles ? so they start on a solid foundation.<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>

b.      Energy modelers of new construction are normally given scant information.  <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>

?   Partly this is due to the owner not knowing exactly how the new facility will be used.<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>

?   Partly this is due to the Owner and Designer not caring about, not appreciating the importance of, or just not needing to gather detailed information about the operation of a building that hasn?t been built.<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>

?   Partly it?s because ?as built? is never ?as designed?. (Think of fan and pump pressure estimates differing from actual, weather variances, occupancy schedule changes, etc.)<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>

?   The energy modeling community has, it seems, a lot of bright young men and women who are ?learning the ropes?.  The fact that they are becoming involved is very exciting!  Their education must be broadened, however, in order for them to become effective at modeling existing buildings. It?s no longer just theory;  there is a lot of practical, ?hands on? activity that is needed.<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>

3.       Inferred above is the host of variables that differ in an actual building?s operation from what may have been assumed.  The older the building, the more variations there are!<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>

5.       This is a field ripe with opportunity!

The next task is to streamline the process of calibration and identification of opportunities so that they is faster and more economical.<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>

I am the Chair of the conference committee for the ASHRAE 2012 Energy Modeling Conference that will be held in Atlanta on October 1, 2 & 3 this year (see link below).  The conference is focused on bringing practitioners, software developers, researchers and facility users together for 3 days of in depth discussion on current modeling software capabilities and current best practices in energy modeling.  I have two questions that I would like to pose to this group to get some feedback to help provider richer content for the discussions planned at the conference;<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>
1. Are the current energy modeling tools available to an energy modeling practitioner reliable enough to allow the modeler to predict a building's actual energy consumption with a high degree of confidence such that an accurate energy target can be established and recommended to the building owner for the new building or a  renovation/retrofit? <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>
2. Are the current best practices of the energy modeling community reliable enough, and well understood by most practitioners, to allow the modeler to predict a building's actual energy consumption with a high degree of confidence such that an accurate energy target can be established and recommended to the building owner for the new building or a renovation/retrofit? <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>
<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>
Background for the discussion:<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>
These questions recently came up in a discussion among the conference committee.  It seems that one our colleagues from the UK indicated that in the UK new schools have performed very poorly in comparison with their predicted energy use.<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>
<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>
Another comment that was made was as follows:<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>
"Often a building's actual energy consumption is 1.5 to 2 times as much as the results of an energy model that was used to make decisions during design about the building's energy using systems.  Is it the the energy modeling tools or is it the processes used by energy modelers to describe the systems and how they operate in the software? Should energy models be used to "predict" a building's future energy performance or just be used to inform better decisions during design?<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>
<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>
I have reviewed a good many models and, almost without fail, I never see a modeler start by writing a sequence of operation and I also never see the sequence of operation used by the modeler make its way into a set of construction documents.  <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>
<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>
Also, when I am the modeler and I am "calibrating" a model to an existing building's actual energy consumption it is a very iterative process.  I know what things to manipulate in the model to effect demand and what things to manipulate to effect consumption.  I just keep going back and forth until I have a model that you can almost lay its output on top of the building's utility bill history. I also have a good understanding of how the building is actually being operated and maintained - which I hope helps make the model more accurate, but, does that process really give me a better model to make decisions from?"<mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com>

Thanks, Jeff for the great synopsis and list of sources for calibration
methods, and for others providing an enlightening discussion. Discussions
like this are why I subscribe to the bldg-sim.

I've felt for a while that standardized calibration procedures for
different kinds of buildings would be highly useful for the community of
modelers working on calibrating to existing buildings (like those of us
doing impact evaluation measurement and verification work for utilities and
regulators).

I think the whole idea of an uncalibrated model being able to predict
energy consumption of a real building is off base. Look at the BESTEST
results for different simulation engines looking at simplified results. I'm
not sure what a reasonable standard would be for prediction when you have a
well-specified set of building operating parameters, but my gut says its at
least +/-30%, and more like +/- 50%.

This is where modelers need to have a consistent, clear message on why
building energy models make sense for new construction. I'm not a new
construction modeler and never have been, but I see the value from new
construction models being to evaluate different design options for saving
energy compared to some baseline, and for estimating what the savings
fraction relative to a baseline. While these kinds of results aren't
completely independent of actual building occupancy and usage, they are
likely to be accurate enough to provide useful information to the design
process and create real value. We need to remember the inherent uncertainty
in the results, but also remember that the information is still useful for
making decisions about a building's design and which design paths are
likely to offer more cost-effective means of achieving energy efficiency
goals.

If we want to come up with target EUIs for newly constructed buildings,
then I think major benchmarking studies are much better ways to go, i.e.
what is the typical consumption of new buildings having X application with
X occupancy patterns in X climate, and what is the distribution. If you're
a standard deviation below the mean, you should have a big opportunity for
improvement.

Last, I think we should have some way of quantifiying the resiliency of
savings associated with different kinds of energy efficiency measures. This
comes down to how sophisticated the building operator needs to be to
maintain the savings as designed. For example, an improvement to the
envelope is pretty close to permanent. A high efficiency chiller or other
primary HVAC device should offer savings regardless of what the operator
does. An enthalpy-controlled economizing system is not very permanent, and
any kind of reset schedule for various airside or waterside heating and
cooling delivered to the space is only going to last with an adept building
operator in charge. It would be nice to standardize a way to differentiate
energy scoring of new buildings on the basis of where the savings are
coming from and have some way of discounting controls-based savings against
envelope or equipment-based savings as a means of showing the true value of
savings that are more resilient to the whims of building operators with a
different objective than energy savings.

Justin Spencer

Robby,

 

Note to G2.4 states that using the actual rates ".allows users to gain
credit for features that yield load management benefits. Where such features
are not present, users can simply use state average unit prices from EIA".
Assigning in-unit cooling to residential meter in the baseline versus
non-residential meter in the proposed design may produce cost savings, but
these savings are not due to load management benefits (i.e. reducing peak
demand or shifting it away from peak periods) and thus should not be
contributing to the performance rating. So it looks pretty clear to me that
you should be using non-residential meter for space cooling in the baseline.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Mixed-Use project with multiple meters - Match Proposed
or Reality?

 

I have a multifamily project which will have a noresidential electricity
meter to cover house loads and a residential electrical meter for each unit.
The baseline system is System 2 - PTHP's.  The proposed system is Chilled
Water with Electric Heat.  Due to the rate structures out here in Seattle,
I'm noticing that the virtual rate in the baseline is approximately 10%
higher than in the proposed.  I've tracked it down mainly to the fact that
the baseline "Space Cooling" usage is allocated to the Residential meters
while the Proposed "Space Cooling" is provided by a chiller that will be on
a nonresidential meter.  In reality, a terminal piece of equipment within a
residence would be metered by the residential panel and charged direct to
the residence.  However, it seems a bit unfair that the baseline is being
penalized strictly based on which meter the "Space Cooling" is assigned to.

 

I can't find anything specifically within Appendix G that would tell me to
have the same energy meters or rate structure by system.  The LEED Reference
Guide provides guidance that says the same rate schedules shall be used for
the proposed and baseline simulations and building.  

 

Mixed-use buildings seem to be a weak point of Appendix G and I'm wondering
if anyone else has run into this issue before.

Justin,

 

I agree with you that it is important for modelers to have a consistent,
clear message on why building energy models make sense for new construction,
and want to reiterate what Jeff wrote below, that their main intent is to
rate building's assets from efficiency standpoint. In this sense,
performance rating calculated via 90.1 Appendix G is conceptually similar to
efficiency ratings of HVAC equipment (EER, COP, etc.), MPG fuel economy for
cars,  or kWh consumption on appliance's Energy Guide label. I don't think
there is any disagreement regarding the usefulness of the standard EER, COP,
MPG, etc. ratings. It is also widely understood that these ratings represent
performance at standard rating conditions and thus will not match the actual
equipment efficiency achieved in a particular installation. All buildings
are different, making it impractical to use field testing to rate their
performance (for one, it would be too late to improve building efficiency if
it is already constructed), so we have to resort to energy modeling. 90.1
App G protocol is not intended for predicting the actual post-construction
building  consumption. This is made very clear in Note 2 to G1.2: "Neither
the proposed building performance nor the baseline building performance are
predictions of actual energy consumption or costs for the proposed design
after construction. Actual experience will differ from these calculations
due to variations such as occupancy, building operation and maintenance,
weather, energy use not covered by this procedure, changes in energy rates
between design of the building and occupancy, and the precision of the
calculation tool."

Discussion

 

Thanks, Jeff for the great synopsis and list of sources for calibration
methods, and for others providing an enlightening discussion. Discussions
like this are why I subscribe to the bldg-sim. 

 

I've felt for a while that standardized calibration procedures for different
kinds of buildings would be highly useful for the community of modelers
working on calibrating to existing buildings (like those of us doing impact
evaluation measurement and verification work for utilities and regulators). 

 

I think the whole idea of an uncalibrated model being able to predict energy
consumption of a real building is off base. Look at the BESTEST results for
different simulation engines looking at simplified results. I'm not sure
what a reasonable standard would be for prediction when you have a
well-specified set of building operating parameters, but my gut says its at
least +/-30%, and more like +/- 50%. 

 

This is where modelers need to have a consistent, clear message on why
building energy models make sense for new construction. I'm not a new
construction modeler and never have been, but I see the value from new
construction models being to evaluate different design options for saving
energy compared to some baseline, and for estimating what the savings
fraction relative to a baseline. While these kinds of results aren't
completely independent of actual building occupancy and usage, they are
likely to be accurate enough to provide useful information to the design
process and create real value. We need to remember the inherent uncertainty
in the results, but also remember that the information is still useful for
making decisions about a building's design and which design paths are likely
to offer more cost-effective means of achieving energy efficiency goals. 

 

If we want to come up with target EUIs for newly constructed buildings, then
I think major benchmarking studies are much better ways to go, i.e. what is
the typical consumption of new buildings having X application with X
occupancy patterns in X climate, and what is the distribution. If you're a
standard deviation below the mean, you should have a big opportunity for
improvement. 

 

Last, I think we should have some way of quantifiying the resiliency of
savings associated with different kinds of energy efficiency measures. This
comes down to how sophisticated the building operator needs to be to
maintain the savings as designed. For example, an improvement to the
envelope is pretty close to permanent. A high efficiency chiller or other
primary HVAC device should offer savings regardless of what the operator
does. An enthalpy-controlled economizing system is not very permanent, and
any kind of reset schedule for various airside or waterside heating and
cooling delivered to the space is only going to last with an adept building
operator in charge. It would be nice to standardize a way to differentiate
energy scoring of new buildings on the basis of where the savings are coming
from and have some way of discounting controls-based savings against
envelope or equipment-based savings as a means of showing the true value of
savings that are more resilient to the whims of building operators with a
different objective than energy savings. 

Regards,

Justin Spencer

Hello,

 

There are lots of interesting threads on this conversation. However, I think
that there are also some misconceptions.

 

First, model as you will for new construction, at best, in my opinion, you
are performing a rating of the building's assets compared against a
standard, much like the mileage ratings on a car that you purchase. If you
are using the IECC, 90.1, 189 or the IGCC, you have to use specific rules to
guide the input of internal heat gains, etc. Such rules have been carefully
crafted to avoid gaming and to attempt to deliver the same result regardless
of who performs the simulation.

 

Therefore, it is my opinion that such a simulated asset rating of a building
should not be construed to match the actual energy use of the building
(period). If does happen to match the actual energy use, then a miracle has
just taken place because the probability of this not happening is large. 

 

Second, if you do attempt to match the energy use of a real building, there
is advice about how to go about this in the literature, including the
results of many ASHRAE projects, for example: RP827 for in situ equipment,
RP 1404 (ongoing) for how to use short term/long term measurements to match
a real building, RP1051 for advice about overall calibrations, RP1052 for
advice on AHU modeling, RP1004 for advice on thermal storage modeling, RP865
for advice on secondary system modeling, and soon RP1468 for advice about
modeling and BIM to thermal. So, there's hope that one can actually match a
real building, if you have measured data and if you have real systems that
match your model's systems, and if you have real weather data and if you
have a large budget and tons of patience, etc., etc. Otherwise, getting a
"match" is really an exercise of "matching lumps" against "measured lumps".

 

Third, don't ever forget that simulations of building envelopes are just
great big R-C networks, and when you attach a system simulation to this you
are perhaps adding a bit of psychrometrics, and then a bunch of curve fits
since most widely used programs do not have first principle models of their
chillers, boilers, etc., just curve fits.

 

Fourth, whole-building simulations do a really bad job of simulating faults
or broken systems. For 

example, when a building is badly zoned (i.e., the thermostat and zoning was
wrong from the building and parts of the building are always too cold or too
hot, etc.). In such cases, you can't simulate it very well. In other cases,
where valves are broken and/or the building has weird controls -- best of
luck.

 

Fifth, simulations of building envelopes is still REALLY CRUDE. For example,
simulation programs have no wall thickness. Think about it. The wall is just
a thin 2D construct with the thickness only accounted for in the material
definition. Hence, to get it right, a simulator has to "setback" the
windows, since most windows are located midway in the wall and have a small
2 to 3 inch shade from the overhang of the lintel. Or consider that
simulations do not consider the corners of buildings, just the area of the
wall. So, you've got lots of corners in your building you might need to
compensate. 

 

Sixth, shaded windows in the DOE-2 family of codes use George Walton's
algorithm to assign the calculation point for the shading. This has 10
divisions by default, it splits the window in half vertically, then each
half into fifths.or if you choose 20, 30.up to 40 it keeps going. For most
rectangular windows this doesn't make a difference, but for a shaded, curved
window in elevation, to get the most accurate results, you end up with a bit
of a quilt-looking window - no kidding. RP1468 (forthcoming) will shed some
light on items 5 and 6.

 

So, before we make claims about how to do things better, we need to remember
just how rough we are REALLY doing them now (actually it's can be pretty
good), and then choose our words carefully when we make claims about what is
being simulated - I'm just as guilty of this as anybody.

Two things: 

 

1.  Some modeling software has lots of controls built into default HVAC
system types.  These controls are often better than what is planned or
installed for the building.  For example: economizers, demand controlled
ventilation or outdoor air reset might be assumed.  Similarly, on many
projects the HVAC controls drawings or sequence of operation is either
missing or not useful at all.  Without good information, it's tempting as a
modeler to assume efficient control of equipment.  However, on the actual
building, the opposite is likely to happen.

 

2.  Once I account for usage patterns, if a building I modeled during design
performs poorly in comparison to my model, I generally view at as the
building's "fault", and not the fault of my model.  The model can be a great
diagnostic tool for discovering where/how the building is not operating as
was modeled.  With a cooperative engineer and facilities manager, we can
usually make adjustments in building controls to bring the building more
closely in line with the model.  If the building was not insulated properly,
that is another matter, and post-occupancy adjustments are
difficult/impossible to make.  However, I would argue that the solution is
not to model poor construction and execution, but try to find a way to use
the model's projected energy data to keep the energy target in sight through
construction.

Hi all. I'd like to echo Jim's comment, and express excitement about what
RMI is doing. Related to the "reality factor," I've seen a tremendous gap
between what LEED/GBCI wants and what will actually take place in the
building, and the lack of sanity checks in modeling software. Though it is
the responsibility of the modeler to perform sanity checks, and quality
control, just spending the extra couple of hours each project can make the
world of difference. On that end I've created a slew of my own sanity-check
post-processing tools for eQuest and feel like our deliverables have
improved significantly as a result.

 

What some of the data our clients are sharing has begun to express the
overwhelming need for these checks in all modeling, which includes analyses
I've reviewed on behalf of our clients. In recent projects I've gone so far
as to assume building-user error, reflected in schedules and temperatures,
which has been spot on when comparing to metered data. This is somewhat
taboo, because not many people are likely to voice these foreseeable
shortcomings when delivering EUI's during design that look inflated, for a
new "high performance" building, but as sanity checks and associated tools
develop it may become easier.

 

What we can do, as an industry, is get better at setting expectations
parallel to educating the building community about the usefulness/value of a
good model.

 

Great thread folks.

This is a timely issue to be raised. I appreciate David Ellis' overview. As
he states, the industry expects the need for adjustments/corrections to
verified savings models so the same should nominally be expected for
whole-building simulation models developed to inform design decision. 

 

During the RMI Building Energy Modeling Summit
(http://www.rmi.org/ReportsBEMInnovationSummit), the Methods & Processes
break-out group came to agree that part of the modeling credibility
challenge could be managed by addressing owner's expectations. We determined
that modeling was performed for one of three objectives - 1) for making
performance comparisons (e.g. comparing design options), 2) demonstrating
compliance (e.g. LEED baseline or code) or 3) predicting performance.
Depending on the objective, the level of effort and associated costs are
different (as others have acknowledged on this email chain). The owner and
statement of work need to recognize these differences. And as others have
pointed out, a building simulation model assumes ideal conditions. It can be
used to benchmark actual operation against and detect operational issues.
But it can't be expected to reflect conditions other than those assumed in
the model. 

 

Inspired by the work plan developed by the Methods & Processes break out
group (see link for final report and work plan), I submitted a proposal to
DOE to complete work in line with what David proposed for the industry. We
are just getting it underway. We refer to it as the Building Energy Modeling
Library or Modeling for Investor Confidence. While this is a broad area, we
are starting by structuring and documenting modeling best practice
procedures to facilitate their use in modeling guidelines, standards, scopes
of work etc. As much as possible, we aim to include risk
assessment/management into the methods. Once developed, the methods will be
posted on the internet. I'll share our progress as we go with the
list-serve. 

 

I also recently co-authored a paper on risked-based building energy
modeling, which provides a pretty good overview and some new ideas to
support the topic. If anyone is interested to read it. let me know and I'll
email you a copy.

 

Best regards,

Ellen.

Bill, Jim, Dennis, et al 

 

This is a tough nut. In the ESPC or ESCO world, where performance must be
depended upon to achieve financial returns, there are understood and
controlling processes in what equipment is bought, how it is installed, how
it is maintained, how it is operated and expected duty schedule. Contracts
are written to reduce uncertainty to the point that in some cases any
deviance, in seemly minor matters, throws the performance expectations up
for renegotiations.

 

While weather changes can be adjusted for after the fact (and thus readily
understood as a reason for some differences between real and modeled
performance), outside of the ESPC/ESCO arena, a design engineer/modeler can
make their best fine tuned efforts on construction intent equipment and
operations, to be undone by changes in installation, commissioning,
operational practices and occupancy that are not under their control, and
are frequently difficult to document after the fact.

 

In the design arena, modeling is a means to assess options on a level plane,
and should not be offered as a predictor of actual cost unless that risk is
fully evaluated and compensated for (both in labor/risk fees and in the
processes to assure changes are documented). There is a real need to fully
vet an industry standard approach to identifying the risks (for fair
negotiation), and establishing standards in best practices.

 

Yes, our modeling does inform sequences of operations, as strategies can be
involved, and are a combined designer and modeler effort. They do indeed
make their way into construction intent documents . but implementation and
ongoing maintenance are another matter.

 

A calibrated model is an excellent tool for more realistically evaluating
operational and systems changes. But here too, the results should be
considered as a way to evaluate options on a level playing field, as control
over so many variables is out of the modelers scope.

 

I would encourage the development of collective industry guidance towards
understanding these risks and offering clarification on expectations for
client informational purposes.

Jim said most of what I was going to say. Additionally,

.         An energy modeler's task for a new construction project is rarely
to accurately predict energy use, but to demonstrate compliance with, and
improvement over, code performance.

.         Modelers generally do not fine tune plug loads, occupant numbers
and schedules etc. because these are kept identical for determining improved
performance over code.

.         Sequence of operations. The modeler is usually not the engineer of
record, and should therefore not be dictating the sequence of operations of
HVAC/plant equipment. I may provide the mechanical engineer with suggestions
on controls strategies and setpoints, and sometimes they are receptive.
However, my focus as energy modeler is energy, and not comfort, system
complexity or reliability. Regardless, the exact sequence of operations,
even if meticulously described in the design documents, may not be
implemented, or may be changed many times during the first year or two of
building operation.

.         No/poor commissioning of buildings. Buildings designed to be very
energy efficient often rely on complex controls for HVAC and lighting
systems. Many buildings are not commissioned, and even in the ones that are,
commissioning is often little more than verifying that the equipment and
controls were installed as designed. The commissioning agent rarely has the
time/budget/scope to determine that all control strategies are operating as
designed. Also, the commissioning agent cannot change the weather conditions
during which the building is commissioned, making it next to impossible to
check CHW controls during winter for example.

.         New buildings often go through many changes in operating
conditions during their first year or two. New buildings are often in use
after hours due to people moving into their new offices, or because they are
nice facilities and the demand to utilize them is high.

.         One of the best ways to predict energy performance is data mining
of existing building performance. Hopefully, CBECS and other building
performance databases will be a big area of focus for our field.

absolutely up to the task.  My own practice uses EnergyPlus exclusively, but
I know that most of the other tools are based in solid thermodynamic and
physical principles - so they start on a solid foundation.

 <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com> b.      Energy modelers of new
construction are normally given scant information.  

 <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com> .   Partly this is due to the owner not
knowing exactly how the new facility will be used.

 <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com> .   Partly this is due to the Owner and
Designer not caring about, not appreciating the importance of, or just not
needing to gather detailed information about the operation of a building
that hasn't been built.

 <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com> .   Partly it's because "as built" is
never "as designed". (Think of fan and pump pressure estimates differing
from actual, weather variances, occupancy schedule changes, etc.)

 <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com> .   The energy modeling community has,
it seems, a lot of bright young men and women who are "learning the ropes".
The fact that they are becoming involved is very exciting!  Their education
must be broadened, however, in order for them to become effective at
modeling existing buildings. It's no longer just theory;  there is a lot of
practical, "hands on" activity that is needed.

 <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com> 3.       Inferred above is the host of
variables that differ in an actual building's operation from what may have
been assumed.  The older the building, the more variations there are!

 <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com> 4.       Most building operators, if
they exist within the building as a full time position, are distracted with
many other details and spent precious little time optimizing energy
performance.  If there is no full time building operator ...

 <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com> 5.       This is a field ripe with
opportunity!  The first and hardest task, I think, is to get building owners
convinced that the ROI for optimal building performance is better than any
of their other opportunities for investing.  The next task is to streamline
the process of calibration and identification of opportunities so that they
is faster and more economical.

 <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com> I am the Chair of the conference
committee for the ASHRAE 2012 Energy Modeling Conference that will be held
in Atlanta on October 1, 2 & 3 this year (see link below).  The conference
is focused on bringing practitioners, software developers, researchers and
facility users together for 3 days of in depth discussion on current
modeling software capabilities and current best practices in energy
modeling.  I have two questions that I would like to pose to this group to
get some feedback to help provider richer content for the discussions
planned at the conference;

 <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com> 1. Are the current energy modeling tools
available to an energy modeling practitioner reliable enough to allow the
modeler to predict a building's actual energy consumption with a high degree
of confidence such that an accurate energy target can be established and
recommended to the building owner for the new building or a
renovation/retrofit? 

 <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com> 2. Are the current best practices of the
energy modeling community reliable enough, and well understood by most
practitioners, to allow the modeler to predict a building's actual energy
consumption with a high degree of confidence such that an accurate energy
target can be established and recommended to the building owner for the new
building or a renovation/retrofit? 

 

 <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com> Background for the discussion:

 <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com> These questions recently came up in a
discussion among the conference committee.  It seems that one our colleagues
from the UK indicated that in the UK new schools have performed very poorly
in comparison with their predicted energy use.

 

 <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com> Another comment that was made was as
follows:

 <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com> "Often a building's actual energy
consumption is 1.5 to 2 times as much as the results of an energy model that
was used to make decisions during design about the building's energy using
systems.  Is it the the energy modeling tools or is it the processes used by
energy modelers to describe the systems and how they operate in the
software? Should energy models be used to "predict" a building's future
energy performance or just be used to inform better decisions during design?

 

 <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com> I have reviewed a good many models and,
almost without fail, I never see a modeler start by writing a sequence of
operation and I also never see the sequence of operation used by the modeler
make its way into a set of construction documents.  

 

 <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com> Also, when I am the modeler and I am
"calibrating" a model to an existing building's actual energy consumption it
is a very iterative process.  I know what things to manipulate in the model
to effect demand and what things to manipulate to effect consumption.  I
just keep going back and forth until I have a model that you can almost lay
its output on top of the building's utility bill history. I also have a good
understanding of how the building is actually being operated and maintained
- which I hope helps make the model more accurate, but, does that process
really give me a better model to make decisions from?"

 

 

 <mailto:wbishop at pathfinder-ea.com> I invite everyone to please, tell us
what you think.

6:30-7:00 PM    Hygrothermal Modeling Methodology*
*Cheryl M. Saldanha, LEED GA ? Building Technology, Simpson Gumpertz & Heger
*

*Description*

Modern buildings typically contain envelope systems that require specific
layers to control condensation due to moisture migration and/or air
leakage, dedicated waterproofing systems to protect moisture-sensitive
backup materials (e.g., wood and gypsum-based products), and thermal
insulation to control heat losses and gains. Consequently, building codes
include provisions for these systems in new construction, and in some
cases, renovation projects. As such, architecture and consulting firms
frequently turn to hygrothermal modeling to determine the optimal
arrangement of these layers. This presentation will introduce the
parameters to consider when setting up a model, and through several project
examples, demonstrate how hygrothermal modeling can be used to develop
assemblies with a low risk for moisture-related problems.  Also, critical
to the process, we will touch on some of the limitations and assumptions
made when developing a hygrothermal model.

*About the Speaker*

Cheryl Saldanha works with Simpson Gumpertz & Heger Inc. in New York City.
Cheryl specializes in building science and building-envelope performance,
including the simulation of heat, air, and moisture migration through
assemblies.  She has investigated building enclosure and mechanical system
failures, and designed remedial repairs.

*7:00-7:15 PM    Q & A

7:15-7:45 PM    Analyzing Moisture in Brick Masonry Walls*
*Pallavi Mantha, LEED AP BD+C ? Building Systems Analyst, Steven Winter
Associates, Inc.

Description*

The thermal resistance provided by un-insulated brick walls (R-3 to R-5) is
often insufficient for occupant thermal comfort and energy efficiency in
most climates. Retrofits to brick buildings are usually conducted from the
interior due to both financial and social pressure to preserve the exterior
fa?ade. This seminar will focus on the thermal and hygric behavior of brick
masonry walls with interior retrofit strategies. Key inputs that affect
results and a methodology to comply with failure criteria are discussed.
Analysis and results from research conducted by SWA will be shared.

*About the Speaker*

Pallavi Mantha works with Steven Winter Associates on high performance
buildings and research projects. Her body of work spans numerous
single-family, multifamily and commercial projects. She provides modeling
support for Building America, NYSERDA Multifamily Performance Program
(MPP), Energy Star Multifamily High-Rise (MFHR) and DOE - Commercial
Building Partnership (CBP).

With funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and
DOE?s Building America Program, she has conducted research and published
papers on topics such as internal moisture loads in homes, High-R walls and
hygrothermal performance of hybrid wall systems. Her areas of expertise
include whole building energy modeling, high performance component
modeling, daylighting, passive solar and renewable energy strategies,
building systems research, and data visualization.**

Hi All:

I don't think this can be done in eQuest. As I understand it, it has to do with resetting the static pressure as VAV boxes close when cooling load reduces. But the only thing I see in a VAV situation is adding a variable speed drive. This would show too much fan savings versus a simple pressure reset, correct?

My controls knowledge is not large.

Thanks in advance.

In the Advanced VAV design guide by Energy Design Resources they have an appendix where they discuss how you might go about doing it in DOE2.1 / eQuest. It involves generating a custom part load curve to approximate the effect of the reset. How valid their assumptions are is up for interpretation though.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED Canada CS - What to use for Plug Load Density
Message-ID: <C63C882531434C4B9A028EB534C10986@MRENG.local>

Hi,

 

It is unclear to me how to model plug and process loads for Core and Shell
Projects in Canada.  There seems to be a conflict between Appendix 2 and the
Table on Page 292 of the Reference Guide.  Has anyone else run into this
before we send in a CIR?

 

The Appendix wants you to use Table 1 plug load densities (i.e. 1.5W/sq ft
for office buildings) for the tenant spaces while Page 292 says to use
values from the standards (i.e. 0.75W/sq ft for office buildings) or provide
documentation for modelled loads.  

 

It's almost like they want you to use the higher value for tenant spaces to
account for unknown plug and process loads in CS projects (server rooms and
resultant A/C, etc.).  If so, I'm not sure if we should still model
elevators, escalators in the common areas or if they are supposed to be
accounted for Table 1.

 

Any thoughts are appreciated!


Aaron

Hi Aaron,


Is it LEED project? If so, in my opinion, if the process energy accounts for no less than 25% of the total energy consumption, it will be OK.
I used 13W/m2 and 15W/m2 before, both OK to acquire the certificate, and I even do not need to explain how the 13 or 15 W/m2 comes.
The elevator energy is included in the process load, so you do not need to separate it out.

 Designbuilder (Simple HVAC)
Message-ID: <6770429BC4498B45B627F96AF8FC047422D5097E6C@helene>

Hello All,
I'm trying to compare two oil boilers with different COPs. One is 55% efficient and the other 82% efficient. I'm using the Simple HVAC model, however the results for Zone heating (kWh) do not change for the two boilers. All other parameters of the building remain the same. One would expect the lower efficiency boiler to perform more leading to a higher energy consumption to a higher efficiency boiler. Has anyone come across this in simulations? Can't understand what I am doing incorrectly.

Apeksha

Aaron ?

I?ve seen both approaches used, since both are cited in the reference manual.

In my opinion, some developers may allocate 1.5 W/sf or more to tenants, but if fit out by typical office tenants, something like 0.75 W/sf is closer to the ASHRAE Fundamentals ?light / medium? loads (p18.13 of Fundamentals 2009). Further, the ASHRAE numbers were developed for peak cooling load calculations, not operating averages, so there is likely some additional diversity in operation which should tend to lower these numbers. Also, since I?m often modeling using schedules from ASHRAE?s User Manual, a case could be made that it is better to use ASHRAE?s tenant plug load numbers to be consistent.

Generally, even when I?m using the higher Core and Shell Appendix 2 numbers, I model elevators separately/explicitly, since Appendix 2 calls the numbers ?tenant receptacle loads.?

If you do send in a CIR and get a response, please let me know!

(caveat ? I?m US-based, not sure if there are variances due to Canada-specific research / codes.)

I think your issue is that Design Builder simple HVAC uses Energy Plus
"ideal loads" HVAC, and that the comparison you are doing requires you to
model an actual HVAC system. Try to use the detailed, or at the least
compact HAVC and see if your problem is solved.

This is in reference Energy Plus (the modern simulation engine supported by
the USDOE) and an interface called "Design Builder", not the legacy DOE2
engine and  eQuest  freeware interface, so INP and PD2 files are not
possible. If you export your IDF or send your DSB file than I could take a
look for you..

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modelling oil-fired systems with different COPs in Designbuilder (Simple HVAC)

Hello All,
I?m trying to compare two oil boilers with different COPs. One is 55% efficient and the other 82% efficient. I?m using the Simple HVAC model, however the results for Zone heating (kWh) do not change for the two boilers. All other parameters of the building remain the same. One would expect the lower efficiency boiler to perform more leading to a higher energy consumption to a higher efficiency boiler. Has anyone come across this in simulations? Can?t understand what I am doing incorrectly.

Regards,
Apeksha

Aaron, thanks for bringing it to my attention that the USGBC has the same
table in Appendix 2.  The difference in the Canadian version of CS is that
there is no requirement for Process energy to be 25% of the baseline energy
cost.  In my case total process and plug loads are currently at 24% of the
design building but only 10% of the Baseline building.  

 

I??ll let you know if we send in a CIR but I think the 25% requirement would
override everything for your and as you say it might not hold up with the
USGBC anyways.

 

Aaron

Aaron ?C 

 

I??ve seen both approaches used, since both are cited in the reference
manual.

 

In my opinion, some developers may allocate 1.5 W/sf or more to tenants, but
if fit out by typical office tenants, something like 0.75 W/sf is closer to
the ASHRAE Fundamentals ??light / medium?? loads (p18.13 of Fundamentals
2009). Further, the ASHRAE numbers were developed for peak cooling load
calculations, not operating averages, so there is likely some additional
diversity in operation which should tend to lower these numbers. Also, since
I??m often modeling using schedules from ASHRAE??s User Manual, a case could
be made that it is better to use ASHRAE??s tenant plug load numbers to be
consistent.

 

Generally, even when I??m using the higher Core and Shell Appendix 2
numbers, I model elevators separately/explicitly, since Appendix 2 calls the
numbers ??tenant receptacle loads.??

 

If you do send in a CIR and get a response, please let me know! 

 

(caveat ?C I??m US-based, not sure if there are variances due to
Canada-specific research / codes.)

Hi Aaron,

 

Is it LEED project? If so, in my opinion, if the process energy accounts for
no less than 25% of the total energy consumption, it will be OK.
I used 13W/m2 and 15W/m2 before, both OK to acquire the certificate, and I
even do not need to explain how the 13 or 15 W/m2 comes.

The elevator energy is included in the process load, so you do not need to
separate it out.

Hi,

 

It is unclear to me how to model plug and process loads for Core and Shell
Projects in Canada.  There seems to be a conflict between Appendix 2 and the
Table on Page 292 of the Reference Guide.  Has anyone else run into this
before we send in a CIR?

 

The Appendix wants you to use Table 1 plug load densities (i.e. 1.5W/sq ft
for office buildings) for the tenant spaces while Page 292 says to use
values from the standards (i.e. 0.75W/sq ft for office buildings) or provide
documentation for modelled loads.  

 

It??s almost like they want you to use the higher value for tenant spaces to
account for unknown plug and process loads in CS projects (server rooms and
resultant A/C, etc.).  If so, I??m not sure if we should still model
elevators, escalators in the common areas or if they are supposed to be
accounted for Table 1.

 

Any thoughts are appreciated!

Message-ID: <CAPqdWFxV84e5YabQv2e4Sd=db=WL0AkmOb9fjm6kCWenAgisbw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

I'm simulating in designbuilder V3 (detailed hvac) a building in order to
fulfill leed requirements.

I am getting now following warnings:

** Warning ** Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed "CL-BS-P0 AHU UNITARY COOLING
COIL DX
COOLING COIL" - Air volume flow rate per watt of rated total cooling
capacity is
out of range at 2.283E-005 m3/s/W.
** ~~~ ** Environment=ICTA, at Simulation time=01/01 00:00 - 00:30
** ~~~ ** Expected range for
VolumeFlowPerRatedTotalCapacity=[2.684E-005--6.713E-005]
** ~~~ ** Possible causes include inconsistent air flow rates in system
components,
** ~~~ ** or variable air volume [VAV] system using incorrect coil type.

....and then....

** Warning ** Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed "CL-BS-P0 AHU UNITARY COOLING
COIL DX
COOLING COIL" - Full load outlet air dry-bulb temperature < 2C. This
indicates
the possibility of coil frost/freeze. Outlet temperature = -10.33 C.

These warnings refer to Baseline Systems, which I have defined using
directly
the DesignBuilder HVAC template ASHRAE 90.1, System No. 6, leaving
everything as
defined by default, including AHU airflows.

Any idea on how to solve this problem would be really appreciated,

Hi Khristiam,

Once you have collected data from wunderground, you can create a custom weather file to run in EnergyPlus using the WeatherConverter executable (Weather.exe), which comes with the EnergyPlus download. To do so, enter your weather data into an excel spreadsheet and create a definition file using a text editor.  The definition file defines the columns in your spreadsheet, the associated units, time steps, etc, and must end in ".def".  The Weather.exe interface reads the .def file and converts the excel sheet into an epw file.  The executable will also create a .csv, .ddy (design day), and .stat file for you.  You can create the weather file with any time step you'd like (1 min, 5 min, 1 hour...).

The EnergyPlus AuxilaryPrograms document provides more detail on this process and shows some examples. 

Are you running in eQuest of EnergyPlus?  Unfortunately I'm not familiar with the eQuest weather file format or how to convert E+ weather files to eQuest weather files, but maybe the csv output could help. 

Regards,
Lesley

Dear Jim and Lesley

Thank you very much for your emails.

I will implement what you reccomend.

I use eQuest software made by DOE, which require *.bin files for weather 
data.

I used a file conversion software to convert *.epw to *.bin

Now, do I have to wait until april 2013 to get a full one year data from 
wunderground for the software to work? or can I use existing data?

Regards

Khristiam,

I guess it depends on how soon you need to run your model.  You can create a sub-yearly weather file (say, April 2012 - August 2012), but WeatherConverter will not interpolate or perform any kind of averaging techniques to complete the year.  You can run an EnergyPlus model with your sub-yearly weather file as long as you set the run period equal to the length of your weather file, or to a time period within your weather file, (say, the month of June for the example above).  I would think you could do the same in eQuest.  

Hope this helps.

Lesley

Dear Jim and Lesley

Thank you very much for your emails.

I will implement what you reccomend.

I use eQuest software made by DOE, which require *.bin files for weather data.

I used a file conversion software to convert *.epw to *.bin

Now, do I have to wait until april 2013 to get a full one year data from wunderground for the software to work? or can I use existing data?

Regards

There is a problem with using weather underground weather data for
simulation. All of the .bin or .epw weather data are Typical meteorological
(TMY) year is averaged over time- so using them to predict the average year
thermal energy use works reasonably well. Data from weather underground is
actual meteorological year (AMY) this will produce a model of the year that
the weather data was measured. The only time when AMY weather data should
be used for modeling is when calibrating a model for an existing building.
The calibration process is to use actual weather data to remove one
variable and then to modify the model to align the loads and consumption to
the designed and measured data from the building. Once the model has
been calibrated with actual weather data, then the modeler changes back
to typical weather data for predicting the average year. Never should one
attempt to predict an typical year from actual year weather data. If you do
not feel that the closest typical weather data to your location is
sufficient than you should pay for a file to be created from
http://weatheranalytics.com/

Well said,  I agree, custom weather files should be used for calibration purposes.  I would also recommend weatheranalytics.com.

One other thought, Khristiam:  If you are creating a custom weather file for calibration, wunderground does not provide your solar data.  Unless you have another source for this component, weatheranalytics might be your best option.

Well said,  I agree, custom weather files should be used for calibration purposes.  I would also recommend weatheranalytics.com.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Creating a weather file

There is a problem with using weather underground weather data for simulation. All of the .bin or .epw weather data are Typical meteorological (TMY) year is averaged over time- so using them to predict the average year thermal energy use works reasonably well. Data from weather underground is actual meteorological year (AMY) this will produce a model of the year that the weather data was measured. The only time when AMY weather data should be used for modeling is when calibrating a model for an existing building. The calibration process is to use actual weather data to remove one variable and then to modify the model to align the loads and consumption to the designed and measured data from the building. Once the model has been calibrated with actual weather data, then the modeler changes back to typical weather data for predicting the average year. Never should one attempt to predict an typical year from actual year weather data. If you do not feel that the closest typical weather data to your location is sufficient than you should pay for a file to be created from  http://weatheranalytics.com/

Khristiam,

I guess it depends on how soon you need to run your model.  You can create a sub-yearly weather file (say, April 2012 - August 2012), but WeatherConverter will not interpolate or perform any kind of averaging techniques to complete the year.  You can run an EnergyPlus model with your sub-yearly weather file as long as you set the run period equal to the length of your weather file, or to a time period within your weather file, (say, the month of June for the example above).  I would think you could do the same in eQuest.

Hope this helps.

Dear Jim and Lesley

Thank you very much for your emails.

I will implement what you reccomend.

I use eQuest software made by DOE, which require *.bin files for weather data.

I used a file conversion software to convert *.epw to *.bin

Now, do I have to wait until april 2013 to get a full one year data from wunderground for the software to work? or can I use existing data?

The definition file defines the columns in your spreadsheet, the associated units, time steps, etc, and must end in ".def".  The Weather.exe interface reads the .def file and converts the excel sheet into an epw file.  The executable will also create a .csv, .ddy (design day), and .stat file for you.  You can create the weather file with any time step you'd like (1 min, 5 min, 1 hour...).

I have attempted to create a simulation-usable weather file from the raw data from 
WUnderground, using the procedure that I have developed over the past 15 years working 
with other sources of raw data, especially NCDC's Integrated Surface Hourly (ISH) data base.

The main problems I've encountered, besides learning how to download conveniently the raw 
data for multiple year, is the absence of sky cover information that I need to extrapolate 
the solar radiation using several empirical models.  I have not pursued this track, i.e., 
using WUnderground raw data, very much because I'm all set up to process ISH data, which 
are records from 8,000 official meteorological stations around the world, which have met 
my needs in almost all cases.  For example, for locations around Caracas, the ISH also 
contains good data for Valencia, as well as Maracay-Ba-Sucr and Pto-Cabello.

Apeksha,

 

It might just be a case of misinterpreting the results...I would advise
checking the "simulation detailed results" descriptions in the help file.
The zone heating is the heat input to the zone from the zone emitters, not
the energy consumed by the plant. You should find that your energy
consumption at building level changes with a change in plant efficiency
(providing all else remains equal).

 

Hope that helps,

 

Dave

Hello All,

I'm trying to compare two oil boilers with different COPs. One is 55%
efficient and the other 82% efficient. I'm using the Simple HVAC model,
however the results for Zone heating (kWh) do not change for the two
boilers. All other parameters of the building remain the same. One would
expect the lower efficiency boiler to perform more leading to a higher
energy consumption to a higher efficiency boiler. Has anyone come across
this in simulations? Can't understand what I am doing incorrectly.

Hi David,
Zone heating is in fact the heating demand of the building that is unaffected by the plant's efficiency as pointed out by Jim Dirkes. When I looked at the heat generation results they were varying for different efficiencies with all other parameters remaining equal.

Thanks,

Dear Khristiam,
I have been using .epw files from www.weatheranalytics.com in the last couple of years, and recommend that you look at their site because their files are more complete than what you might put together from www.wunderground.com. (and inexpensive, too!)
However, I made a another method to collect data from Wunderground before Weather Analytics was founded, and I have attached the executable file as well as the source code.  Warning!  I have not used this for a couple of years and am not sure if it still works properly.
Finally, someone posted an Excel file on this forum or the EnergyPlus forum with a macro to pull information from Wunderground - I have included that, too.

Hi there

Have anyone experience in creating a new weather file from wunderground data?

This is my case: I use the Caracas file download from the EnergyPlus site converted to eQuest format but I live in other hotter city, Puerto Ordaz that has a wunderground station working since last april.

Thank you very much!

Sadaf,

I did this on a LEED platinum project a while back. I recall that we had 
to invoke a couple of clauses in ASHRAE 62.1 to allow us to use thermal 
modelling with CO2 as the metric (at the time 62.1 only had a very basic 
natural ventilation rule of thumb such as minimum distance between 
occupants and openings). IES was used for the analysis, but you could 
use any thermal modelling program that incorporates network air flow 
(e.g. E+, TAS, IDA).

Without being able to get access to the latest 62.1 I can't help further 
- sorry.

You might have trouble meeting ASHRAE 55, depending on your climate.

Hope this helps.

Chris

Dear Khristiam,

We use Meteonorm software when we need a weather file for a city that is not in the Energy Plus database. It uses a large weather station database and where there aren't weather stations, the software interpolates data between different stations. The software isn't free though, it's about 500 euros.
http://meteonorm.com/

Another source I've used that is free or cheap depending on the type of weather data you require is the NOAA site. It looks like their 2 nearest weather stations are called Ciudad Bolivar (Lat: 8.15 deg., Long: -63.550 deg.) and General Manuel Carl (lat: 8.283 deg, long: -62.75 deg.) Here is their site: http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/#t=firstTabLink. You can search for the stations on the map and get hourly data text files. Usually I take these and convert them to .wea or .epa files through Weather Tool (this is an Autodesk product). You might also be able to use the Energy Plus Weather File Convertor which is free, but I haven't used it to convert text files to weather files before.

Hi Apeksha,

I think you're saying the same thing in a different way. The heating demand of the building is met by the zone emitters (after any contributions from internal and external gains), and you wouldn?t expect the zone heating values to change with variations in boiler efficiency. The heat output from the heating plant is that required to meet the heating load; it is unaffected by efficiency but the amount of fuel consumed meeting that output will clearly vary with efficiency.

Hope that helps,

Dave

Hi David,
Zone heating is in fact the heating demand of the building that is unaffected by the plant's efficiency as pointed out by Jim Dirkes. When I looked at the heat generation results they were varying for different efficiencies with all other parameters remaining equal.

Apeksha,

It might just be a case of misinterpreting the results...I would advise checking the ?simulation detailed results? descriptions in the help file. The zone heating is the heat input to the zone from the zone emitters, not the energy consumed by the plant. You should find that your energy consumption at building level changes with a change in plant efficiency (providing all else remains equal).

Hope that helps,

Dave

Hello All,
I?m trying to compare two oil boilers with different COPs. One is 55% efficient and the other 82% efficient. I?m using the Simple HVAC model, however the results for Zone heating (kWh) do not change for the two boilers. All other parameters of the building remain the same. One would expect the lower efficiency boiler to perform more leading to a higher energy consumption to a higher efficiency boiler. Has anyone come across this in simulations? Can?t understand what I am doing incorrectly.

Sadaf,

 

ASHRAE 62 has three paths of compliance:



1.	The Ventilation Rate Procedure (VRP) is a prescriptive option which
means looking up airflow rates in the tables and doing some calculations.
This is the most common path but would normally apply to mechanically
ventilated buildings.
2.	The Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) procedure is performance based which
requires a Mass Balance Analyses (can be done through modeling).  There was
a recent article about this in the June ASHRAE Journal if you are a member.
This can apply to natural or mechanically ventilated buildings.
3.	The Natural Ventilation Procedure (NVP) which states specific
requirements for opening areas. 

 

I believe LEED generally requires you to follow the VRP or NVP but my LEED
2009 says you can show compliance with "acceptable engineering calculations
or multi-nodal bulk airflow simulation" which I think means following the
IAQ procedure.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Creating a weather file

Since this thread is still bouncing around BLDG-SIM, I thought I'd update others on what I 
have done using the ISH data base and sent to Khristiam.

As Krista mentions, the ISH contains two locations : Ciudad Bolivar (WMO 804440) and 
General Manuel Carl (WMO 804463).   Unfortunately, the second station contains only wind 
data and no temperatures, except for half a year in 2011.
The first station, however, contains fairly complete data (~4000 records /year for 2010), 
so I processed that to create a usable weather file in the DOE-2 *.BINM format needed for 
eQUEST (my procedure also produces other formats such as TMY3, TMY2, and EPW).  However, 
when Khristiam used the file, it produced significantly lower cooling loads than using 
Caracas, which of course doesn't make too much sense.  So, I investigated and found that 
the weather file I produced contained very low dew point temperatures around 0 C during 
many of the nighttime hours. I traced this to the raw ISH data where the station 
(airport)  had entered +0000 dew point temperatures over 400 times instead of +9999 for 
missing data.  So, I edited the raw data file and created a corrected weather file, and 
made a mental note to modify my procedure to check for such occurences.

It looks like their 2 nearest weather stations are called Ciudad Bolivar (Lat: 8.15 deg., Long: -63.550 deg.) and General Manuel Carl (lat: 8.283 deg, long: -62.75 deg.) Here is their site: http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/#t=firstTabLink. You can search for the stations on the map and get hourly data text files. Usually I take these and convert them to .wea or .epa files through Weather Tool (this is an Autodesk product). You might also be able to use the Energy Plus Weather File Convertor which is free, but I haven't used it to convert text files to weather files before.

Hello All,
Thank you all very much for this interesting input. Made me realise what the 'Zone Heating' in Designbuilder suggests against the 'Heat generated' by the heating system.

Hi Apeksha,

I think you're saying the same thing in a different way. The heating demand of the building is met by the zone emitters (after any contributions from internal and external gains), and you wouldn?t expect the zone heating values to change with variations in boiler efficiency. The heat output from the heating plant is that required to meet the heating load; it is unaffected by efficiency but the amount of fuel consumed meeting that output will clearly vary with efficiency.

Hope that helps,

Dave

Hi David,
Zone heating is in fact the heating demand of the building that is unaffected by the plant's efficiency as pointed out by Jim Dirkes. When I looked at the heat generation results they were varying for different efficiencies with all other parameters remaining equal.

Thanks,

Apeksha,

It might just be a case of misinterpreting the results...I would advise checking the ?simulation detailed results? descriptions in the help file. The zone heating is the heat input to the zone from the zone emitters, not the energy consumed by the plant. You should find that your energy consumption at building level changes with a change in plant efficiency (providing all else remains equal).

Hope that helps,

Dave

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modelling oil-fired systems with different COPs in Designbuilder (Simple HVAC)

Hello All,
I?m trying to compare two oil boilers with different COPs. One is 55% efficient and the other 82% efficient. I?m using the Simple HVAC model, however the results for Zone heating (kWh) do not change for the two boilers. All other parameters of the building remain the same. One would expect the lower efficiency boiler to perform more leading to a higher energy consumption to a higher efficiency boiler. Has anyone come across this in simulations? Can?t understand what I am doing incorrectly.

Dear members!

Please excuse me if my query isn't directly related to simulations, but as
many academician and practitioners are active members of these lists, hence
I am asking here.

There are many good introductory textbooks on industrial automation and
controls since its a major engineering discipline, however, I couldn't find
good introductory/comprehensive (especially for people from non-electronics
background) textbook/s on Building Automation and Controls. It would be
great if you can suggest some textbooks with academic focus (not much
commercially influenced). Thank you very much!

 Lookup Tables for Control
Message-ID: <CAOQRe6sk9Px2yP9+jM=GS7euEse0nED3uNRcHrfHvTUHUsHknA@mail.gmail.com>

I would like to belatedly announce the posting of my PhD dissertation
entitled Using Building Simulation and Optimization to Calculate Lookup
Tables for Control.

http://escholarship.org/uc/item/1202p562

I would also like to note that the source code download location noted in
the reference list points to a PWGSC ftp site that has since become
password protected, so I have also posted it to the following site:

https://s3.amazonaws.com/SimCon/simcon_v0-2.zip

My apologies for the source code and related tools being less clean than
hoped, and completely lacking in documentation (aside from the
dissertation). I had hoped to rewrite the code and integrate everything as
one coherent tool but time has gotten away from me. Please feel free to
use, modify, rewrite or repackage the source code and tools in any way that
might benefit your own research or practice.

The dissertation abstract is included below. It was completed as part of
the PhD in Architecture (Building Science) at UC Berkeley. The research was
made possible by fellowships from the National Science and Engineering
Research Council of Canada and the American Society of Heating
Refrigeration and Air conditioning Engineers, and through research projects
at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Thank you to my dissertation
committee of Gail Brager, Ed Arens, Francesco Borrelli and Philip Haves.

Abstract:
There is a growing demand for more energy efficient buildings. Integrated
systems with more intelligent controls are an important part of meeting
this demand. Model predictive control (MPC) is an established control
technique in other fields and holds promise for improved supervisory
control in buildings. It has been receiving increasing attention in
buildings research but has yet to find its way into common practice. This
is due, at least in part, to a mismatch between the tools and techniques
used in most MPC development and the tools, skills and processes commonly
found in building design and operation. This dissertation investigates an
approach to optimization-based control that uses common building simulation
tools and could fit more readily into building design and operation
practices. Instead of solving optimization problems in real-time to
determine control set-points given current states and predicted
disturbances, the optimal set-points are pre-computed offline over a grid
of possible conditions and the resulting lookup table is used with linear
interpolation for control. The feasibility and range of applicability of
this approach are evaluated, including analyses of the performance impacts
of grid spacing and techniques for problem dimensionality reduction. Three
abstract case studies and two detailed case studies are presented. The
approach is found to be feasible for supervisory control problems that can
be effectively simplified to functions of roughly 5-6 conditions variables,
and the case studies show good performance relative to online MPC. The
benefits for ease of implementation are significant, but the most useful
aspect is likely the feedback it can provide to the design process.

One of the best that I have found that cover controls from "way back"
(pneumatics, electrical, electronic, . . . ) is the HONEYWELL ENGINEERING
MANUAL OF AUTOMATIC CONTROL which you can download in pdf or buy from
Honeywell

 

https://customer.honeywell.com/resources/techlit/TechLitDocuments/77-0000s/7
7-E1100.pdf

 

I have many more expensive ones, but to be hones this is the best one I have
found to train my Engineers and Technicians

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Request: Suggestion on Building Automation and Controls
textbooks

 

Dear members! 

Please excuse me if my query isn't directly related to simulations, but as
many academician and practitioners are active members of these lists, hence
I am asking here. 

There are many good introductory textbooks on industrial automation and
controls since its a major engineering discipline, however, I couldn't find
good introductory/comprehensive (especially for people from non-electronics
background) textbook/s on Building Automation and Controls. It would be
great if you can suggest some textbooks with academic focus (not much
commercially influenced). Thank you very much!

 

Best regards,


Vaibhav Jain

Doe anyone know if we have to redistribute the windows in a horizontal band
for Epact modelling, or can addendum a on 90.1 2004 can be used to ignore
this requirement? This is for just HVAC modelling (no envelope changes).

Subject: [Bldg-sim] ASHRAE 2012 Energy Modeling Conference - Meeting the
 Industry's Current Needs - Followup and Additional Discussions
Message-ID: <CAAerc9cyQEN2Hd_sfxiwNrJ8jjBc=rU==h1a1USX1eSC3RF_Uw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear bldg-sim list subscribers:

First - I want to thank the entire group for the excellent and thoughtful
responses to the questions I posted on September 4th.  I received over 15
replies.  I have attached a Word document with the topics of discussion and
all replies cataloged.   I will continue to do this and make the document
available by email or will post it online where it can be used by everyone
after the EMC.

Second - Based on the responses to the questions I hope most of you will be
attending the conference and will actively participate in the group
discussions and forums.  We need more of these types of discussions on
tools and processes to help create as large a knowledge base as possible on
the subject so that those newer to the discipline of energy modeling do not
have to make the many mistakes and realize the  many current limitations of
modeling pointed out so well by your replies to my questions  while
"on-the-job" or from the "school-of-hard-knocks" as many of us have done
during our careers.  One thing I was surprised about in the responses was
that only one or two people discussed any standard format or industry
standard guidelines on modeling that they currently apply to their practice
and no one really mentioned ASHRAE Guideline 14, ASHRAE Handbook of
Fundamentals Chapter 19 (and others) or ASHRAE Standards 100 and 140 and
others as well.  These are all excellent resources from which to begin to
create some kind of standardization and a replicable standard of care
around the practice of energy modeling.

Third - I want to shameless put in a plug for the conference: I
believe The ASHRAE
Energy Modeling Conference is meeting the industry?s current needs with
regard to best practices for energy modeling.  Here?s how:


   -  Presenting the new software that is based on EnergyPlus (mentioned by
   several of you in your comments) from LBNL that is being launched the day
   prior to the conference,
   - Presenting Dan Nall?s presentation to help engineers get a step up on
   architects in energy modeling in the design process,
   - Future look at BIM?s and Energy Modeling?s Evolvement toward meeting
   the demand,
   - Numerous case study examples of real world modeling challenges from
   almost 50 speakers and experts in the filed,
   - Demonstrations from most of the major software tool developers and
   national labs doing work in this area, and
   - Firing-line type sessions in a no-holds barred revelation of the
   capability of energy modeling tools and the workarounds used by many to
   fill gaps.

**

**

**

**

Thanks again for your great replies to my last set of questions.  I hope to
see many of you at the conference and get the opportunity to talk with you
face-to-face and discuss the many possibilities to meet our current energy
modeling needs and continue to improve the tools and processes we all need
to serve our clients and industry well.

Sincerely,

Dennis Knight, P.E.

Dear Bldg-Sim List Subscribers,
More food for thought and discussion:  One session that will be featured at
the ASHRAE Energy Modeling Conference is a discussion of Energy Modeling
and BIM - or Bridging the Gaps Between BIM and Simulation.

How many of you are or have adopted some form of BIM authoring
tool/software in your practice?
If so, what have been your two or three most significant challenges in
adopting the technology?
Have you made the move to integrating energy modeling and design analysis
(lighting, daylighting, CFD, etc.) with your BIM's?
If so, what has been your personal experience - difficult, easy, useful,
not useful, too early, not enough tools that work together yet, etc.
Have you created any smart BIM object for use in analytic applications
outside the BIM authoring tool? If so, how did that go?
How could ASHRAE or some other professional association or standards
writing body help make integration and interoperability better?
Thanks in advance for considering my questions.
Sincerely,
Dennis

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Unmet heating hours - EE4 Energy Model
Message-ID: <4F58E2C8F48E47498175B90A9AE7761C021C8B0AD6@MBX23.exg5.exghost.com>

Hi All,

I'm building an energy model in EE4 program. I'm getting a lot of heating unmet hours (in the thousands). The majority of the zones with unmet hours are corridors where I only have make-up air (MUA unit with hot and chilled water coils) serving those spaces. The suites (that are served by 2 pipe fan coils) are in separate systems. I tried decreasing and increasing the airflow/heating capacity in the corridor system but it is not affecting the amount of unmet heating hours at all.

Anyone know why the unmet heating hours are so high?

Thanks and Regards,

Katie

FYI:



There will also be a Seminar at the ASHRAE Conference which reports on the progress of RP 1468 - Reference BIM models. This ASHRAE RP was created to develop standard BIM-to-thermal translations and then test them with industry BIM programs, for example Bentley and AutoDesk. A final report will be available soon from Mike Vaughn at ASHRAE. In it will be a library of "standard" BIM-to-thermal conversions that will help begin the long process of a attempt to someday get similar results from different BIM programs using different thermal simulation platforms.



Unfortunately, all efforts to date use legacy codes (i.e., DOE-2, EnergyPlus, TRNSYS). There is also an effort with LBNL and TAMU to create BIM-to-thermal using Modelica/Dimola, which is showing some interesting first results at the most basic level.



I'm convinced that this will eventually be the future of simulation...although when/how we replace the millions of lines of legacy FORTRAN remains to be seen.

Message-ID: <BBD3B8CDB75B5248AC6C9D7D8F0121ED16558252D6@ffxmail-01.hq.setty.com>

ASHRAE Applications recommends a minimum of 4 ACH for natatoriums. Applying that minimum to my Proposed leads to a somewhat oversized pool unit compared to the Baseline system, which reduces my savings a lot. I couldn't find a code requirement of a minimum amount of ACH, which would allow me to size the Baseline with the same number of 4 ACH. Is somewhere aware of any such code requirement?

A related question: would LEED allow to size the Baseline at 4 ACH, even though the project is not a school?

Thanks for chime in,

Dear Demba,
Airflow is only one of the comparisons for a pool.  The others, all very powerful in impact, are de-humidification, and heat recovery from the refrigeration system for reheating and pool water heating, and heat recovery for outdoor air preheating.

Thank you so much Josh, Jim, Jorge!

I found the following books/papers in my University's library, which I must
add to the list in return:

1. Building Automation (Springer) by H.Merz et. al (I found it not much
helpful for introductory level)
2. Sensors in Intelligent Buildings (Wiley VCH) Edited by - O.Gassmann,
H.Meixner (I found it to be a good introduction to different sensors)
3. Intelligent Buildings and Building Automation (Taylor & Francis) by
Shegwei Wang (I have not read it, but seems to be a nice and slow
introduction, but not in detail)
4. Communication Systems for Building Automation and Control (IEEE paper)
by WOLFGANG KASTNER et. al. (must read for new-comer)

Particularly, I found this lecture series, from IIT India, quite useful.
Especially - introduction, series on PID controller, and then on field bus
network:

Demba,

 

In previous versions of LEED, I think you could consider the pool a process
load and model the natatorium as an empty space.  Now that you need to
include process loads, perhaps you can have the reference and proposed equal
unless you are trying to claim savings as Jim mentioned.

Dear Demba,

Airflow is only one of the comparisons for a pool.  The others, all very
powerful in impact, are de-humidification, and heat recovery from the
refrigeration system for reheating and pool water heating, and heat recovery
for outdoor air preheating.

ASHRAE Applications recommends a minimum of 4 ACH for natatoriums. Applying
that minimum to my Proposed leads to a somewhat oversized pool unit compared
to the Baseline system, which reduces my savings a lot. I couldn't find a
code requirement of a minimum amount of ACH, which would allow me to size
the Baseline with the same number of 4 ACH. Is somewhere aware of any such
code requirement?

 

A related question: would LEED allow to size the Baseline at 4 ACH, even
though the project is not a school?

 

Thanks for chime in,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Unmet heating hours - EE4 Energy Model

 

Hi All,

 

I'm building an energy model in EE4 program. I'm getting a lot of heating
unmet hours (in the thousands). The majority of the zones with unmet hours
are corridors where I only have make-up air (MUA unit with hot and chilled
water coils) serving those spaces. The suites (that are served by 2 pipe fan
coils) are in separate systems. I tried decreasing and increasing the
airflow/heating capacity in the corridor system but it is not affecting the
amount of unmet heating hours at all. 

 

Anyone know why the unmet heating hours are so high?

 

Thanks and Regards,

 

Katie

In a recent LEED project with a pool, my assumptions were:

*         The Aquatics space requires special temperature and humidity for 24/7 schedule, and thus merits use of a "non-predominant" special Baseline (System #3 or #4)

*         The Baseline system (#3 in this case) used the standard delta T, fan power, etc.

*         The Proposed system used hot gas reheat, a standard (80%) efficiency boiler for additional heating, heat recovery for the minimum outdoor airflow, and heat recovery from hot gas (if available after reheating) for pool water heating

*         Pool water heating, including pool wall conduction loads and pool pumps were considered "process" loads

*         Results were favorable!

Message-ID: <70668EC1241E5A40ABA1FB2C0694DA490DEB7088CC@MEEMAIL01>

Hello all,

Has anyone had trouble with erroneous "HOURS ANY ZONE ABOVE COOLING THROTTLING RANGE" when using cooling design days?  This number reported in both the BEPS and BEPU reports does not offer any insight on where it comes from, so it's especially difficult to troubleshoot.

I'm noticing several different simulation runs where the "PERCENT OF HOURS ANY SYSTEM ZONE OUTSIDE OF THROTTLING RANGE" is at either 0 or 0.01% while there are thousands of "HOURS ANY ZONE ABOVE COOLING THROTTLING RANGE."  I thought when this field was added that it was supposed to report unmet hours, but I can't see why the numbers don't agree.

It appears that eQUEST has a hard time distributing airflow to zones correctly unless enough days are included in the "design day" dialogue box, but when you enter too many, the phenomenon above tends to occur.

Can anyone shed light on where the "HOURS ANY ZONE ABOVE COOLING THROTTLING RANGE" and "HOURS ANY ZONE BELOW HEATING THROTTLING RANGE" come from since LEED reviewers are now looking at this and only this to determine unmet hour compliance?

Thanks,

Thanks Guys,

I appreciate your comments.

I use System 3 as recommended by Appendix G for pool space conditioning. Evaporation load is included. Relative humidity is maintained to max 60%. But still, the sizing I get for the Baseline remains below 4 ACH. I would like to find backup material to make the case that the Baseline should use 4 ACH as the Proposed. Equitable? Or maybe not?

Any more ideas?

Regards,

Demba.

*         The Proposed system used hot gas reheat, a standard (80%) efficiency boiler for additional heating, heat recovery for the minimum outdoor airflow, and heat recovery from hot gas (if available after reheating) for pool water heating

*         Pool water heating, including pool wall conduction loads and pool pumps were considered "process" loads

Demba,

In previous versions of LEED, I think you could consider the pool a process load and model the natatorium as an empty space.  Now that you need to include process loads, perhaps you can have the reference and proposed equal unless you are trying to claim savings as Jim mentioned.

Dear Demba,
Airflow is only one of the comparisons for a pool.  The others, all very powerful in impact, are de-humidification, and heat recovery from the refrigeration system for reheating and pool water heating, and heat recovery for outdoor air preheating.

ASHRAE Applications recommends a minimum of 4 ACH for natatoriums. Applying that minimum to my Proposed leads to a somewhat oversized pool unit compared to the Baseline system, which reduces my savings a lot. I couldn't find a code requirement of a minimum amount of ACH, which would allow me to size the Baseline with the same number of 4 ACH. Is somewhere aware of any such code requirement?

A related question: would LEED allow to size the Baseline at 4 ACH, even though the project is not a school?

Thanks Rut.  I only have two "design day" components in the model.  The trouble is with how many days you allow them to run for.  It's the bottom field on the lower left hand side of the design day dialogue box with BDL keyword NUMBER-OF-DAYS.  The simulation behaves very oddly when you modulate this number, and to this point my conclusion is there is trouble within eQUEST with accurately allotting airflow to zones as required based on their "design day" calculated load.  I haven't figured out exactly what the problem is.  The building in question has an odd footprint shape with lots of glass, so I'm betting the problem is with how eQUEST calculates solar load and provides for zone airflow in response.

My issue with the way LEED unmet hours are reported/reviewed is that the fields in BEPS/BEPU do not provide any information troubleshoot them.  In previous versions of eQUEST (DOE-2.2-47d and before) there were no heating and cooling fields, so you either had to use the PERCENT OF HOURS ANY SYSTEM ZONE OUTSIDE OF THROTTLING RANGE which didn't break them up into heating and cooling or use the SS-R reports.

I often find under eQUEST v3.64 that the SS-R reports show no unmet hours anywhere, but there are still some showing up in the BEPS/BEPU reports under HOURS ANY ZONE ABOVE COOLING THROTTLING RANGE and HOURS ANY ZONE BELOW HEATING THROTTLING RANGE.  I'm suspicious of them since during the same run the PERCENT OF HOURS ANY SYSTEM ZONE OUTSIDE OF THROTTLING RANGE lists 0 or a very small percentage (0.05% or lower).  How can the two not agree?

As far as my comments, apologies if you're a LEED reviewer.  If you are, you have a tough job, and there is a lot of information to pour over to determine if a model is done correctly.  Appendix G is still very ambiguous since it grew out of the pre-LEED days and is meant to appease many software packages.  It would be nice to have more specific information about how passages in Appendix G are interpreted, and perhaps a revamp would be appropriate since the energy modeling world has gone through seismic change in the last 5 years.

Thanks for the response.

Hi Matt,

You shouldn't have more than two "design days" defined under eQUEST's 'Project&Site' tab ; one CDD and one HDD with the design temperatures based on ASHRAE 90.1 Table D-1 or similar deign day data source.  I'm looking at my model and I couldn't even add another design day, beyond the two I've already had.

I've run into some issue with the mystery unmet hours before.  It's most likely stemmed from a 'single-zone-controlled' system with multiple thermostat schedules, such as PSZs and SZRs will only allowed one thermostat'ed zone per system.

Additionally, have you made any adjustments to the internal loads for the zones with the unmet hours?  By adjusting the internal loads, it should help the HVAC system size proper air flow into those zones.

LEED reviewers have always looked at these unmet load hours...not sure what the last comment is about, because Appendix G dictates that you may not exceed the total of 300 hours combined.  By not conforming to the requirement, it is seen as your models are not properly created.  Since you mentioned LEED reviewer, did the model come back from LEED comments for clarification, or you're just being cautious.  For the latter, good for you.  If it's because of the former, I'd suggest having someone with LEED modeling experience take a look at the models along with the LEED comments/questions.

I hope some of this helps.  Good luck.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Problems with Design Days

Hello all,

Has anyone had trouble with erroneous "HOURS ANY ZONE ABOVE COOLING THROTTLING RANGE" when using cooling design days?  This number reported in both the BEPS and BEPU reports does not offer any insight on where it comes from, so it's especially difficult to troubleshoot.

I'm noticing several different simulation runs where the "PERCENT OF HOURS ANY SYSTEM ZONE OUTSIDE OF THROTTLING RANGE" is at either 0 or 0.01% while there are thousands of "HOURS ANY ZONE ABOVE COOLING THROTTLING RANGE."  I thought when this field was added that it was supposed to report unmet hours, but I can't see why the numbers don't agree.

It appears that eQUEST has a hard time distributing airflow to zones correctly unless enough days are included in the "design day" dialogue box, but when you enter too many, the phenomenon above tends to occur.

Can anyone shed light on where the "HOURS ANY ZONE ABOVE COOLING THROTTLING RANGE" and "HOURS ANY ZONE BELOW HEATING THROTTLING RANGE" come from since LEED reviewers are now looking at this and only this to determine unmet hour compliance?

Thanks,

Matt Edwards, P.E., LEED AP BD+C

Dear Demba,
For the pool I recently modeled, I did not make the Baseline airflow anything different than what was auto-sized at 20F delta T.  However, you have caused me to think about this further and it seems that perhaps Exception c. for G3.1.1 may apply to you if the pool's airflow rate can be argued to be "code-required" at 4AC.  If I had thought of it, I think I would have done this.  As it is, we just received comments back from GBCI, and with 38% savings already, I don't think I will "rock the boat".

If the baseline HVAC system type is 5, 6, 7, or 8, use
separate single-zone systems conforming with the
requirements of System 3 or System 4 (depending on
building heat source) for any zones having special pressurization
relationships, cross-contamination requirements,
or code-required minimum circulation rates.

Thanks Guys,

I appreciate your comments.

I use System 3 as recommended by Appendix G for pool space conditioning. Evaporation load is included. Relative humidity is maintained to max 60%. But still, the sizing I get for the Baseline remains below 4 ACH. I would like to find backup material to make the case that the Baseline should use 4 ACH as the Proposed. Equitable? Or maybe not?

Any more ideas?

Regards,

Demba.

Is this still on track to be released this month? I haven't heard anything and the month is almost over so I?m just curious.

Hello everyone.

A quick question for you.

We're modeling a building to evaluate its performance for LEED Canada-CS, using EE4/MNECB as the modeling tool.

My question is whether or not if we should/need to define different utility rates for the proposed building and the reference building. Is this allowed?

The motivation for this is because the electrical utility rate for our region is set with a minimum kW to pay each month, which is equal to 65% of the max demand over a period of 12 months. So, if a given monthly kW demand is lower than that minimum, you pay a "penalty" for un-demanded kW.

Since both proposed and reference buildings have a different monthly demand profile, the min kW to pay, and the total "penalty", would differ. This influences the total energy costs for both building, and the % energy savings used to evaluate the LEED points.

So, can we set different rates, defined to match the actual utility demand of each case? My guess is yes, but I want to check...

Thanks.

Frederic Genest, P.Eng.

Frederick,
If the reference building were to be constructed instead of the proposed
building would it actually have a different utility rate by virtue of its
size or other characteristic?

Yes, still on track for the end of the month - though please bear in 
mind that this is a beta release.  Significant energy modeling 
experience, preferably with EnergyPlus, will be needed to recognize when 
some aspect of the tool is not working correctly.  We do expect to get 
substantial feedback from this release. This feedback will result in 
significant improvements to both the program and the associated 
documentation and training materials for the Version 1 release, which is 
planned for the turn of the year.

Watch this space for download information!

I'm not familiar with LEED Canada specifically, so these thoughts are applied to Appendix G modeling in general. The rate structures should be the "same" based on the utility tariffs that apply to the building.



Each of the proposed and baseline cases will set their own demand "ratchet". So the Baseline will have a 65% of its maximum, and the Proposed will have a different 65% of its own maximum. When you calculate the average $/kWh for each of the two models, they could be different between the two cases.



I'm not sure if EE4 includes this ratchet capability as a built in feature, but many other software programs do. If the baseline system selections end up with equipment that suffers under the ratchet, while the Proposed case minimizes the penalty, the Proposed model would justifiably be rewarded.



To take this credit the actual tariff will have to be modeled with all of the demand and energy based components. Credit probably wouldn't be allowed if you had used a weighted average utility price including all factors. If that was the case, then the rates should be identical in both models. I'm not sure how this impacts LEED Canada projects.



Under some scenarios the Proposed and Baseline cases might fall into different tariffs with the utility, this would also be allowable if you can provide the documentation on each being subject to different requirements. Similarly it would not be allowed if you use a weighted average utility price instead of modeling the actual tariffs.

Hello everyone.



A quick question for you.



We're modeling a building to evaluate its performance for LEED Canada-CS, using EE4/MNECB as the modeling tool.



My question is whether or not if we should/need to define different utility rates for the proposed building and the reference building. Is this allowed?



The motivation for this is because the electrical utility rate for our region is set with a minimum kW to pay each month, which is equal to 65% of the max demand over a period of 12 months. So, if a given monthly kW demand is lower than that minimum, you pay a "penalty" for un-demanded kW.



Since both proposed and reference buildings have a different monthly demand profile, the min kW to pay, and the total "penalty", would differ. This influences the total energy costs for both building, and the % energy savings used to evaluate the LEED points.



So, can we set different rates, defined to match the actual utility demand of each case? My guess is yes, but I want to check...



Thanks.

Frederic,

This is an interesting scenario. It seems that the utility has decided to incetivize buildings with a high base-to-peak ratio. So if you have a high peak, most of the time the actual demand will be above 65% of the peak, and no penalty is incurred. Buildings with a low base-to-peak ratio will be below 65% more often and have to pay. Makes good sense from a utility perspective, since a flat demand profile means fewer utility plants that must be built and kept idling when demand is low. 

I'm not sure how the CaGBC would treat this case. At first glance, the proposed building is benefiting from utility pricing rules. If this building was built elsewhere, it would not benefit from this utility structure. So your LEED points shouldn't take this demand penalty into account. In some sense this is similar to campus buildings which might pay a discount campus DES rate (which is not allowed under DES rules to ensure fair comparisons).

But on the other hand, LEED cares about making smart decisions within the regional context, so you could argue that your proposed design should be rewarded if it can take advantage of this regional utility structure. You could argue that your design provides a wider benefit since it helps the utility smooth-out the demand profile, which is clearly one of the utility's goals and a benefit to the wider grid. 

My recommendation would be to submit a CIR or discuss this with a CaGBC peer reviewer (if you are considering engaging one for a 3rd party review). If you can afford to leave these cost savings on the table, maybe they can qualify as an innovation point (for regional priority). My gut feel is that the demand penalty would not be eligible toward LEED points.

Hello Dennis.

It would be the same "general" rate (i.e. rate "M"), but its implementation would be different (i.e. "min monthly billable rate").

Is it allowed under ASHRAE 90.1 App G to define different rates, or different implementation of the same rate? If so, I guess the same rule would apply for EE4/MNECB modeling.

Thanks for any input!

Frederic.

Frederick,
If the reference building were to be constructed instead of the proposed building would it actually have a different utility rate by virtue of its size or other characteristic?

Hello Luka.

You have it right, I expect. The utility (Hydro-Quebec, in this case) seems to try to have designers/operator flatten the demand profile. Or, from another point of view, that they try to avoid the winter electrical heating peak if they can.

OTOH, when you reach a sufficiently high monthly energy consumption (i.e. 210 000 kWh), the excess kWh is billed about 30% cheaper.

And since the reference building is in fact consuming more energy, it pays cheaper a bigger fraction of its kWh. The averages are 8 ?/kWh for the reference building, compared to 9 ?/kWh for the proposed building.

Hence, following your reasoning, since the rate is already penalizing the proposed building for being energy efficient (on a $/kWh basis), somewhat offsetting this by compensating with a corrected kW rate might be seen as "acceptable" by the CaGBC.

Thanks for the comment, I'll think on that. 
Frederic.

Frederic,

This is an interesting scenario. It seems that the utility has decided to incetivize buildings with a high base-to-peak ratio. So if you have a high peak, most of the time the actual demand will be above 65% of the peak, and no penalty is incurred. Buildings with a low base-to-peak ratio will be below 65% more often and have to pay. Makes good sense from a utility perspective, since a flat demand profile means fewer utility plants that must be built and kept idling when demand is low. 

I'm not sure how the CaGBC would treat this case. At first glance, the proposed building is benefiting from utility pricing rules. If this building was built elsewhere, it would not benefit from this utility structure. So your LEED points shouldn't take this demand penalty into account. In some sense this is similar to campus buildings which might pay a discount campus DES rate (which is not allowed under DES rules to ensure fair comparisons).

But on the other hand, LEED cares about making smart decisions within the regional context, so you could argue that your proposed design should be rewarded if it can take advantage of this regional utility structure. You could argue that your design provides a wider benefit since it helps the utility smooth-out the demand profile, which is clearly one of the utility's goals and a benefit to the wider grid. 

My recommendation would be to submit a CIR or discuss this with a CaGBC peer reviewer (if you are considering engaging one for a 3rd party review). If you can afford to leave these cost savings on the table, maybe they can qualify as an innovation point (for regional priority). My gut feel is that the demand penalty would not be eligible toward LEED points.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Defining Utility rates - proposed building different than reference building?

Hello everyone.

A quick question for you.

We're modeling a building to evaluate its performance for LEED Canada-CS, using EE4/MNECB as the modeling tool.

My question is whether or not if we should/need to define different utility rates for the proposed building and the reference building. Is this allowed?

The motivation for this is because the electrical utility rate for our region is set with a minimum kW to pay each month, which is equal to 65% of the max demand over a period of 12 months. So, if a given monthly kW demand is lower than that minimum, you pay a "penalty" for un-demanded kW.

Since both proposed and reference buildings have a different monthly demand profile, the min kW to pay, and the total "penalty", would differ. This influences the total energy costs for both building, and the % energy savings used to evaluate the LEED points.

So, can we set different rates, defined to match the actual utility demand of each case? My guess is yes, but I want to check...

Thanks.

Frederic Genest, P.Eng.
Pageau Morel.

See example below (open website & download from URL) which shows why commercial bldgs in downtown Chicago use electricity for winter heating.  The location used was Minneapolis (severe winters) but the utility rates are for Chicago.  ComEd  Rate GL for summer with Rider 25 for winter which makes winter electric heating cheaper than the gas rate (Nicor).  ComEd power plant is not idle in winter

Rohini & others:

I have on occasion referenced more recent errata, addenda, and versions of standards to justify practices without incident under LEED and COE reviews for energy modeling.  I think so long as you are keeping a level playing field between your proposed/baseline and not somehow regressing the model's degree of representation, you ought to be fine.

That said, let me take this into a related tangent:  who reviews EPAcT models?  Has anybody run into this yet?  I find it hard to suggest anything is "safe" considering....

To my understanding, documentation for EPAcT deductions of any sort remain in everyone's filing cabinets until an audit should occur.  Such model(s) would therefore only be called into question if the individual/company claiming the tax deductions were audited.  In such a case, would the IRS engage an independent, 3rd party staff (i.e. LEED's reviewership) for reviews, or hire/train their own internal branch?  Would that review process incorporate a comment/response opportunity to make amends if the reviewer finds something they disagree with, or would the deduction be simply rejected?  What implications would that have for those signing off on the EPAcT documentation?

Such questions and grey areas have kept me from pursuing EPAcT modeling with any particular gusto...  Has anyone run through a review process, or otherwise know what procedures are or will be in place for such audit scenarios?

Subject: [Equest-users] Fwd: Epact model - windows as horizontal band

Did not hear anything from the Bldg-sim list, so hopefully someone from the equest list can shed some light.
Does anyone know if we have to redistribute the windows in a horizontal band for Epact modelling, or can addendum a on 90.1 2004 can be used to ignore this requirement? I really don't want to spend time changing windows in detailed mode if that can be avoided. The models are already existing, so cannot use the wizard. This is for just HVAC modelling (no envelope/lighting changes).

Thanks

from my understanding when the irs reviews epact tax deductions they a) 
audit the firm(s) claiming the deduction in full, not just the epact 
claim, and b) hire qualified people (i.e. licensed engineers, lighting 
people, etc) to review the supporting documentation models, calcs, 
certification letter, site installed equipment measurements, etc.

my experience with banding the windows is that it can, depending on your 
actual window orientation, give you a bit more percentage saving.  it 
can of course also take a way a bit of a percent if more of your window 
space is moved to orientations where you have less solar heat gain in a 
predominantly cooling climate, but living in a predominantly cooling 
climate i've gained (and not just epact) and extra percentage point or 
so when i have banded the windows.  probably works the same way for 
heating in a predominantly heating environment but i haven't tried 
simulating that case.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Heads Up:  LEED Lighting changes
Message-ID: <ECDF361A89E5FA479BE7E64C658B52050FD0B7D8@SANDBINC4.sbi.smithboucher.com>

Want to share something that's news to me.

LEED-2009 projects using the most recent version of the SSc8 templates will find the allowable baseline exterior lighting figure rewritten to incorporate 90.1-2007 addendum i.  This was officially incorporated by LEED in November of 2011.  The LEED/USGBC documentation often refer to "addendum 1," but from context its clear they mean lowercase "i."

Addendum i strikes out and re-writes the allowable installed watts for exterior lighting table in chapter 9.  What this means broadly for those filling out SSc8 and EAc1 templates is the allowable watts for baseline models is now "zone-dependent" (i.e. rural vs. city, like more recent versions of 90.1/IECC), and generally much more stringent.  I don't observe any changes specific to exterior lighting controls.

If your project was registered before November of 2011 and your credit templates are current, you'll find the credit templates are not smart enough to recognize addendum i was not adopted when the project was registered.  Some have reported success appealing during submittal that the template's math doesn't represent what's required, furnishing pre-addendum i calculations in their documentation.

For those using COMcheck to assemble documentation for LEED SSc8/EAp2, I've opened a query with the developers and have learned they do not as a matter of policy intend to incorporate 90.1-2007 with addendum i into the program, making this tool unwieldy for demonstrating exterior calcs + compliance for LEED, until LEED-2013 rolls into practice.  Short of falling back to excel spreadsheets, is anyone aware of any similar tools for time-efficiently documenting 90.1-2007 compliance that handles addendum i?

Thanks!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Problem with Heat Recovery and peak thermal loads
Message-ID: <CACwmnFfFUgR2cpPB-LJR21XUz-+X9e8GRSM4WeL_8056_JZZnw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear community:

I?m having a problem with a health facility simulation, especifically on
heat recovery application.
My problem is with theory, and with the operation principle of this
equipment. Let?s suppose 2 cases of modelling, where the difference between
them it?s only the heat recovery (40% of efficiency) ?what results can I
expect of the model with HR?:

-lower peak thermal load, and/or
-lower energy demmand?

I would like your wisdom* opinion

best!

Chris,

In response to the posting below I sent the following: "This 
course does not seem to be related to building energy 
simulation and modeling. Please do not post courses that are 
unrelated to the topic of the mailing list in the future."

The posting guidelines are on the following page:

http://onebuilding.org/guidelines.html

I tend to warn people when they go outside the guidelines 
and unsubscribe them or ban them when they persist. Most of 
the time people just apologize.

I have tried to make the guidelines fit the interests of 
those on the mailing lists. If you think they should be 
revised let me know.

In order to completely eliminate the issue, we would have to 
moderate the list (i.e. have someone approve each message 
before it is sent to everyone). I am not sure it is enough 
of a problem to go to that step. I have also thought about 
making new subscriber's messages get moderated until they 
show that they are posting on topic and within the 
guidelines but most new subscribers have legitimate questions.

I welcome your feedback.

Jason

I am not a big fan of advertising on bldg_sim but 
I wonder where that line might be drawn.  If we 
are talking about building performance simulation 
(IBPSA for example) I would think that lighting 
would be relevant.  Especially considering the 
mandatory lighting control requirements included 
in 90.1-2010 and other standards.  Tool such as 
ecotect, Daysim, etc. would seem to belong in the 
category of acceptable topics for bldg_sim and 
hence, educational courses aimed at lighting 
techniques including controls would be relevant?

Lighting control strategies are certainly of interest to a large body of energy modelers, I agree completely.  

That said, I think the announcement under discussion is misplaced for more basic reasons.  Unless the organizers truly anticipate participants to fly into New Delhi from across the globe (bldg-sim is a global body), they are better off focusing on the targeted local engineers & designers this event is intended to host.  

I actually attended a local seminar recently covering similar topics (hosted by Philips incidentally), and I learned of that opportunity through my local IES chapter mailing list.  Had they tried to reach me through [bldg-sim] I probably would have ignored and missed the opportunity completely.

If this were being broadcast globally over the internet, that might be a different story, but I didn't pick that up from the original post.  Even then, if the content is of a product-specific nature then what's available in markets halfway across the globe probably isn't applicable to designers on other continents.

Ultimately, I think these lists are a totally appropriate venue when the audience is supposed to be the broader, global community of those involved in energy modeling, bearing in mind the restrictions already set in place with the list guidelines Jason has linked us to.

Gentlemen,

Thanks for your comments. There is a degree of advertising bandwidth and 
when this originates from participating list members, that's great. 
Afterall, who would begrudge gard themselves or other such doyens!

When somebody's first and only post to the list is sales, then perhaps 
we should direct them to a new list: "bldg-spam"!

Cheers

Chris

If we are talking about building performance simulation (IBPSA for example) I would think that lighting would be relevant.  Especially considering the mandatory lighting control requirements included in 90.1-2010 and other standards.  Tool such as ecotect, Daysim, etc. would seem to belong in the category of acceptable topics for bldg_sim and hence, educational courses aimed at lighting techniques including controls would be relevant?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Can-Quest "Security Risk"
Message-ID: <840DDF4A4F9A4EC48367CAE1D46F71A2@MRENG.local>

Hi,

 

When I downloaded Can-Quest last month my virus scanner (Norton) scanned the
file and said that the file has a "low reputation score", it is "likely to
be a security risk" so it was quarantined and deleted. The only way to
install Can-Quest was to turn off the virus scan.  Nothing has shown up on
that computer yet so before I bring that computer on our servers, has anyone
else had this issue?  I contacted NRCan but they don't seem to have any
similar reports.

 

Thanks.

Message-ID: <5064CA31.5090002@gmail.com>

Dear all,

This is a little embarrassing but I'm having a difficultly understanding 
the requirements for 90.1's system 2 (PTHP) with respect to fresh air. I 
used the E+ example file generator 
<http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/cfm/inputs/> to 
create a simple 90.1 compliant "baseline" model for a dwelling (to use 
it as a template for a more detailed model). In the model from the file 
generator the PTHP operates 100% recirc, no OA. Checking CO2 levels, the 
air quality is fine (rarely exceeding 1200ppm). However, the only 
outdoor air entering the model is via infiltration. To compound the 
mystery, there are sizing parameters in the model that suggest OA should 
be delivered by the PTHP. I've also looked up some product specs and it 
appears that the units typically do do OA.

I feel like I've only got about as far as understanding that System 2 
shouldn't have an economiser! Does anybody know if there are any rules 
with respect to anything like OA fraction?

Also, in terms of system architecture E+ creates most models (including 
PTHP) with a mixing box, however would such a device physically have a 
mixing box? I'm sure that there is very little difference 
computationally, but it would be interesting to know.

I guess this query is also relevant to PTAC as well.

Many thanks

Chris

Hello all, we are simulating a VRF system with EE4.  

 

To do so, we used zonal heating pumps coupled to a cooling tower and an
electric boiler.  However, we want to modify the boiler EIR in order to
simulate the condenser (HP) that is actually adding heat to the hot water
loop.  To do so, we changed the Elec-Boiler EIR in Doe2.1
 unfortunately,
this had no influence on the heating consumption.  We verified if the boiler
was used or not in the global annual consumption and it was.

 

We tried the same for a 4-pipe system and the heating consumption did
changed with the EIR modification.

 

Does anyone have a clue of how to proceed to modify the boiler EIR while
usinf zonal HP system.

 

Regards,

You are correct, when BOILER-TYPE = 
ELECTRIC-BOILER, the BOILER-EIR and BOILER-HIR 
keywords have no bearing on what is reported in BEPS for heating.

Your best bet is to use a different version of 
DOE2.1e (the EE4 version does not work 
correctly), modify your EE4 generated .DOE file 
to use HP-LOOP-HEATING = FROM-PLANT.  Then you 
can set the BOILER-EIR in Plant accordingly.

Dear Building Simulation Community, 

I would like to inform you
that there are still spots remaining in the October 8-10 TRNSYS Training
Course on Capital Square in beautiful Madison, WI. The course covers a
range of topics and demonstrations for the TRNSYS software package.
Please visit the following website for information, course outline, and
registration forms. 

http://tess-inc.com/trnsys/schedule-2012-fall [1]


Please email me or submit a registration form to reserve your spot in
the course if you are interested. This is a fine opportunity to learn
with the TRNSYS experts from Thermal Energy System Specialists (TESS).
There are discounted hotel rates for course attendees, and Madison is
located about 125 miles (200 km) northwest of Chicago and 80 miles (130
km) west of Milwaukee. There is also an airport in Madison (MSN) with a
hotel shuttle. 

For more information about the dynamic energy and
building modeling software package, TRNSYS, please visit www.trnsys.com
[2] or the UW-SEL TRNSYS site [3]. If you have any questions or
concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Message-ID: <1B23446CBF250648A2FC775DE3FE7E8017E9FF@OC11expo28.exchange.mit.edu>

Dear colleagues:

Some of might be interested in the Cambridge Solar Map, a new interactive map to show Cambridge property owners how much electricity can be produced on their rooftops from solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, how the financial investment will pay off and how much pollution will be reduced (http://www.cambridgema.gov/solar/). The map is based on Radiance/Daysim simulations of about 17,000 rooftops with the 3D model derived form GIS and LiDAR data. Technical details on the map can be found here<http://mit.edu/SustainableDesignLab/projects/CambridgeSolarMap>.

Those of you in the Greater Boston Area are very welcome to join us on Wednesday, Oct 3,  at 6PM in the Cambridge Main Library on Broadway for the 'official release' of the map. The city has invited a number of solar installers who will be showcasing their products and services. Starting at about 6.30 PM we will have an hour of presentations.

Best,

Christoph

Message-ID: <CANmX-Du9Ge5R=VCtRe9um=t3NJv3GOo8EibN=HV2SfqWjXdozQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all


I'm trying to mdel an UPS (Uninterruptible Power System) but I'm not sure
of what would be the power that I should model. The capacity of the UPS is
100KVA, but this capacity will be use only when a "emergency" happens, the
rest of the time the UPS will be in some kind of "stand by" mode with the
battery full charged, so how much it will consume while it is in this mode?

Thank you.
