Peter,
I think as Vikram mentioned, it depends on the total exhaust (cumulative exhaust 
of all the fume hoods). If the total exhaust exceeds 15,000cfm, then  the 
baseline needs to have AT LEAST one of the following:

1. VAV hood exhaust till a 50% min turn down over the total CFM. Hence you could 
only take advantage of a lower VAV set point on the actual equipment.
2. Make-up air. Separate make-up air with supply temperature very close to room 
temperatures.
3. Heat recovery . If the building has both VAV and HR, then you should be able 
to take  full benefits of heat recovery or vise-versa.
 
Hence if your total fume hood exhaust is lower than 15,000 cfm,  then you should 
be able to take advantage of  VAV fume hood exhaust over constant volume 
exhaust.

Does this make sense?

Gerald

Thanks for all the help. Here is another angle I am coming from.
Assuming the base case were to be a traditional fume hood exhaust system which 
used constant volume fans in order to create the 3000 fpm discharge velocity. If 
the fume hoods have sash control the there is an outside air by-pass on the fan 
header, so down stream VAV and upstream constant volume exhaust fans.  I know 
these constant volume fans can be staged to form a 'quasi' variable exhaust. So 
if this were the base case then one could apply the list of various innovations 
on how to apply variable exhaust flow to the proposed model.
The ASHRAE 90.1 6.5.7.2 isnt really a solution, however Aleka you mention Lab 
21, have you had any luck in getting this accepted by the LEED meanies?

I just spent a while digging through all the latest docs on modeling labs for a 
LEED analysis (90.1-2004, 90.1-2007, addenda, & Labs 21).  This is my 
interpretation:
	* If the building has fume hood exhaust over      15,000 cfm, the Baseline 
system is VAV, and exhaust is turned down to at      least 50% for unoccupied 
hours.  I am modeling the unoccupied turn      down rate the same in the 
Baseline as in the Proposed models, because how      low it can go at night 
depends on the type of lab (ie: the project doesn't      get more credit for 
turning down to 20%).  This is from Labs 21, and      90.1 (2004 or 2007) 
section 6.5.7.2.
	* A project can claim energy savings for demand      controlled fume hoods 
during occupied hours if the controls are automatic      (Labs21 has some 
schedules for guidance in modeling this).
	* Energy recovery is not modeled in the Baseline      (see 90.1-2007 G3.1.2.10 
Exception h).
Let me know if you have a different interpretation....I don't think all these 
issues are laid out in detail for modelers yet.

I think it also depends on the software you are using to model a fume hood. 
Because if exhaust is specified more than the supply  due to the hood, the 
software  may disregard the lower supply and equate the higher value of exhaust 
to the supply. I am also trying to  model a VAV exhaust fume hood and facing a 
lot of problems doing it. So you have to figure out a way to control you exhaust 
by altering your VAV supply.
If you know some other way, please let me know also :)

Can anyone tell me when modeling a lab system with fume hoods as to whether the 
baseline systems are to be modeled as constant volume?

(subsequent alternatives will have variable volume fume hoods).

Thank you Jeff for sharing your perspective on the exam.
Anyone considering an ASHRAE certification, should also consider the ASHRAE Continuing Education (ACE) credit requirements for recertification.
http://www.ashrae.org/certification/page/1684
Non-governmental certifications & accreditations (ASHRAE, USGBC, AEE) can be more specific than many professional license maintenance requirements.

Hello:

I can't speak to the LEED NC exam, but I can say that anyone who takes and passes the ASHRAE BEM Certificate really has to know something about building energy modeling, and probably much more. The ASHRAE Building Energy Modeling (BEM) exam was developed by ASHRAE in cooperation with IBPSA USA. IBPSA USA and ASHRAE have also developed a BEM workshop to assist in reviewing for the BEM exam, which I'd highly recommend as well. Dates for these workshops can be found on the ASHRAE web page, as well as the IBPSA USA web page, and other places.

As someone who has taken and passed the exam, I can say that it was one of the hardest exams I've taken in a long time. It really tested my knowledge of building energy simulation and, with so many questions, and so short a time, it really tested my ability to sit through such an rigorous ordeal, and answer questions one after another, in rapid fire. I was humbled by the experience, and I've taught simulation since the early 1980s.

Finally, it is my biased opinion that the building energy performance industry will soon begin to see the value in having "ASHRAE BEM Certified" simulators. Hence, I would strongly recommend giving this some serious consideration as a career enhancing opportunity.

Jeff

PS: I'd also consider taking the ASHRAE BEM workshop...a good warm up for the exam.

Paul,

"For equal time, does anyone care to weigh in on AEE's BESA - Certified
Building Energy Simulation Analyst?
http://www.aeecenter.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3479"

This is the first I've heard of BESA. From the link, it is a new
certification and I'm guessing no one is certified yet. You have to take
the training course first, which costs $1350 plus travel and lodging.
Then you have the $200 exam fee and $200 renewal every three years. My
guess is that there will be far fewer certified as BESA than ASHRAE
BEMP. I think BEMP will be exclusive enough where it still has meaning,
but might grow large enough that it is recognized by architects and
engineers that don't do energy modeling. (Full disclosure - my boss is
the new ASHRAE President.)

Personally, I think the AEE is too expensive. I go to their local meetings
sometimes and they are good but as far as joining, too expensive. I agree
with Bill that the BEMP certification will be much better. In interests of
full disclosure, it was my idea and I think Lynn rocks!

Improving building performance since 1982

>>> Jeff Haberl <jhaberl at tamu.edu> 8/31/2010 9:11 PM >>>
Hello:

I can't speak to the LEED NC exam, but I can say that anyone who takes and passes the ASHRAE BEM Certificate really has to know something about building energy modeling, and probably much more. The ASHRAE Building Energy Modeling (BEM) exam was developed by ASHRAE in cooperation with IBPSA USA. IBPSA USA and ASHRAE have also developed a BEM workshop to assist in reviewing for the BEM exam, which I'd highly recommend as well. Dates for these workshops can be found on the ASHRAE web page, as well as the IBPSA USA web page, and other places.

As someone who has taken and passed the exam, I can say that it was one of the hardest exams I've taken in a long time. It really tested my knowledge of building energy simulation and, with so many questions, and so short a time, it really tested my ability to sit through such an rigorous ordeal, and answer questions one after another, in rapid fire. I was humbled by the experience, and I've taught simulation since the early 1980s.

Finally, it is my biased opinion that the building energy performance industry will soon begin to see the value in having "ASHRAE BEM Certified" simulators. Hence, I would strongly recommend giving this some serious consideration as a career enhancing opportunity.

Jeff

PS: I'd also consider taking the ASHRAE BEM workshop...a good warm up for the exam.

I am a CEPE, but not yet a BEMP (but I've been reading this thread with
interest).
Looking at the flavor of expertise tested on the BEMP exam, and contrasting
this with California's CEPE, I would say that the two are not a good fit.
 The CEPE test was almost entirely focused on the Title 24, and how that
specific code considers various elements within energy modeling.  For
example, there are questions about how much low-efficacy lighting is allowed
in kitchens and bathrooms, and under what conditions.  So, it is less about
energy modeling itself, and more about how Title 24 wants you to review
plans and compose energy models.

Thus, I think I would find *both* certifications useful, but for different
reasons.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Hourly schedules for equipment gains, occupancy,
	and lighting for typical houses in the UK
Message-ID: <606672.87998.qm@web24007.mail.ird.yahoo.com>

Hello,

I want to simulate the thermal performance for typical houses in the UK (or 
England).  National calculation method (http://www.ncm.bre.co.uk) is for 
buildings other than dwellings.  But hourly schedules for equipment gains, 
lighting, and occupancy are available from this database. For example, 
Dwell_DomBed(An area primarily used for sleep), Dwell_DomLounge (The main 
reception room of the home), etc.   I am not sure whether these schedules are 
appropriate for the application of building simulation in typical UK houses? If 
not, any other database may be avaiable for the UK houses? I have checked the 
Standard Assessment Procedure SAP and there are not detailed hourly schedules 
for this purpose. 


Thanks a lot,

Jin

Neither am I without seeing them. What sort of times/outputs do they
specify? Given that info we should be able to see if they were wildly
innapropriate of not. They are presumably based on US data?

I'm not aware of other data. PHPP must have some numbers in it for
this stuff, which would at least be european-based, if not
specifically UK. Lighting times certainly need to be
lattitude-adjusted as we get a lot of dark-hours in comparison to
central europe.

The activity data in National Calculation method is very suitable for building 
energy simulation and they are hourly schedules.  DesignBuilder also has the 
same data.  I do not know whether they are based on US or not. It seems they are 
more suitable for dormitory.  


Maybe there are large variations of occupancy behaviour for the residential 
buildings. So, the hourly schedules for occupancy, equipment, and lighting are 
not available for UK typical houses.

I tend to agree on the whole with Jin.

The NCM should give you a good basis for comparison purposes but  
obviously if you are looking in more detail you may want to make your  
own custom profiles and schedules.

It comes from gathered data by the BRE over many years essentially or  
at least the commercial bits certainly do.

You may want to check out the SAP requirements which may also have  
some information that will be useful.

Most software now has a number of inbuilt domestic scehdules. I know  
both Designbuilder and IES do so they're normally a good starting  
point of reference.

Peter et.al,

Sorry for the delay in responding to the string.  I've tried to summarize the questions/answers below and have combined responses and added my own content in places I think appropriate...


1)      Can anyone tell me when modeling a lab system with fume hoods as to whether the baseline systems are to be modeled as constant volume?

VIKRAM: I think that depends on the total volume of exhaust. I don't have it in front of me, but I think if your exhaust is more than a certain amount you have to have either energy recovery to fifty percent or vav flow.

VARUN: I think it also depends on the software you are using to model a fume hood. Because if exhaust is specified more than the supply  due to the hood, the software  may disregard the lower supply and equate the higher value of exhaust to the supply. I am also trying to  model a VAV exhaust fume hood and facing a lot of problems doing it. So you have to figure out a way to control you exhaust by altering your VAV supply.

ALEKA:

o   If the building has fume hood exhaust over 15,000 cfm, the Baseline system is VAV, and exhaust is turned down to at least 50% for unoccupied hours.  I am modeling the unoccupied turn down rate the same in the Baseline as in the Proposed models, because how low it can go at night depends on the type of lab (ie: the project doesn't get more credit for turning down to 20%).  This is from Labs 21, and 90.1 (2004 or 2007) section 6.5.7.2.

o   A project can claim energy savings for demand controlled fume hoods during occupied hours if the controls are automatic (Labs21 has some schedules for guidance in modeling this).

o   Energy recovery is not modeled in the Baseline (see 90.1-2007 G3.1.2.10 Exception h)

GERALD: I think as Vikram mentioned, it depends on the total exhaust (cumulative exhaust of all the fume hoods). If the total exhaust exceeds 15,000cfm, then the baseline needs to have AT LEAST one of the following:

1. VAV hood exhaust till a 50% min turn down over the total CFM. Hence you could only take advantage of a lower VAV set point on the actual equipment.
2. Make-up air. Separate make-up air with supply temperature very close to room temperatures.
3. Heat recovery . If the building has both VAV and HR, then you should be able to take  full benefits of heat recovery or vise-versa.

Hence if your total fume hood exhaust is lower than 15,000 cfm,  then you should be able to take advantage of  VAV fume hood exhaust over constant volume exhaust.
PAUL:
This is my response for 90.1-2007 (which incorporates addenda to 2004 and Labs21 guidance):

o   If the building laboratory space [interpreted as system] (per G.3.1.1 exception d) has exhaust over 5,000 cfm, the Baseline system is VAV, and exhaust is turned down to at least 50% of design for unoccupied hours.  I am modeling the unoccupied turn down rate the same in the Baseline as in the Proposed models, because how low it can go at night depends on the type of lab (ie: the project doesn't get more credit for turning down to 20%).  This is from Labs 21, and 90.1 (2004 or 2007) section 6.5.7.2.  Whether or not your hoods provide the 50% turndown or if a reduction in general exhaust is also required will be determined by the type of hood specified and the minimum air change rate in your lab zones.  the exhaust is turned down.  In either case, credit can be taken in the Proposed if it has a turndown lower than 50%.  We have had this approved on projects.  However, the LEED Reviewers have been particular about the minimum outdoor air ventilation requirement (G3.1.2.5) and insist that the difference between your Proposed and Baseline airflows (typically 100% OA) be treated as Return Air.  This is not a typical practice in laboratory design for good reason, but there has been insistence from the Reviewers.  This poses "issues" for strategies such as cooling/ventilation decoupling strategies, dynamic ventilation based on air quality sensing, and fume hood controls/ECMs (as well as the realities of actually modeling it accurately).  Have others seen instances of this Reviewer feedback?

o   A project can claim energy savings for demand controlled fume hoods during occupied hours if the controls are automatic (Labs21 has some schedules for guidance in modeling this).  We agree with this.  Labs21 developed a fume hood modeling schedule which is now incorporated into the 90.1 User's Manual.  However, it assumes certain hood parameters that should be adjusted to those of the hoods on your project.  It also assumes perfect sash management based on the Labs21 occupancy schedules.  We take credit by modifying the fume hood schedule based on industry/client data on % of time people are actually in front of the hoods and the response time of the sensors/control strategies.  Perfect sash management at night is still considered in our approach.

o   Energy recovery is not modeled in the Baseline (see 90.1-2007 G3.1.2.10 Exception h).  90.1-2007 no longer offers an either or as was the case in 90.1-2004.

2)      Assuming the base case were to be a traditional fume hood exhaust system which used constant volume fans in order to create the 3000 fpm discharge velocity. If the fume hoods have sash control the there is an outside air by-pass on the fan header, so down stream VAV and upstream constant volume exhaust fans.  I know these constant volume fans can be staged to form a 'quasi' variable exhaust. So if this were the base case then one could apply the list of various innovations on how to apply variable exhaust flow to the proposed model.  If lab system had <5000 cfm of exhaust then you can have constant volume hoods in the Baseline.  If your spaces are not hood driven at any time, then modeling hoods as constant volume is pointless as you don't need to model the hoods.  If your hoods do drive the space ventilation and the former two items aren't true then they will need to be VAV.  Your question really gets to the matter of exhaust fan modeling if I read it correctly, and the ability to see savings there due to strategies for reducing zone/system exhaust.  Currently there is no defined Baseline exhaust fan modeling specified in 90.1.  We have submitted many projects with constant exhaust fan bhp in the Baseline case to simulate variable exhaust with constant velocity discharge using OA bypass.  We have taken credit for fan staging and variable velocity discharge (based on wind tunnel guidance for the turndown).  The ASHRAE Continuous Maintenance process considered adopting this as an addendum to 90.1-2007 but as I understand it the direction taken was to specify some level of fan staging as the Baseline.  This is not yet published to my knowledge.

3)      The ASHRAE 90.1 6.5.7.2 isnt really a solution, however Aleka you mention Lab 21, have you had any luck in getting this accepted by the LEED meanies?  Hopefully my comments above clarify what we've attempted and what's been accepted.

Perhaps others see it differently and would like to comment.  Good discussion.

Regards,
Paul

I just spent a while digging through all the latest docs on modeling labs for a LEED analysis (90.1-2004, 90.1-2007, addenda, & Labs 21).  This is my interpretation:

 *   If the building has fume hood exhaust over 15,000 cfm, the Baseline system is VAV, and exhaust is turned down to at least 50% for unoccupied hours.  I am modeling the unoccupied turn down rate the same in the Baseline as in the Proposed models, because how low it can go at night depends on the type of lab (ie: the project doesn't get more credit for turning down to 20%).  This is from Labs 21, and 90.1 (2004 or 2007) section 6.5.7.2.
 *   A project can claim energy savings for demand controlled fume hoods during occupied hours if the controls are automatic (Labs21 has some schedules for guidance in modeling this).
 *   Energy recovery is not modeled in the Baseline (see 90.1-2007 G3.1.2.10 Exception h).
Let me know if you have a different interpretation....I don't think all these issues are laid out in detail for modelers yet.

John - The Tacoma climate is very similar to Seattle.  The winters are
cool and wet, and the summers are cool and dry.  The proximity of the
Puget sound keeps the humidity in the comfort zone in general.  The
climate is definitely heating dominated, and cooling is unnecessary for
most occupancies, as long as some moderate amount of attention is paid to
the envelope design.  A useful climate visualization tool is "climate
consultant" a free software that you can download here:

Yeah, Morgan is right. We don't have humidity, we have rain. I can get hot
for up to a week in the summer and if you are in a commercial building your
clients will be very unhappy if you don't have AC. A very good climate for
heat pumps VRV/simultaneous heating and cooling/or whatever, depending on
your usage and footprint.

I like using TRNSYS for projects that include daylighting and natural ventilation. TRNSYS gets cumbersome if you have a lot of zones. 

TRNSYS can directly pass natural ventilation information to and from CONTAM, which will give you fairly accurate results. This level of rigor is required for compliance with the LEED natural ventilation pilot credit if you are going for that. 

Also its fairly easy to import daylighting results from Daysim or Radiance into the lighting schedules in TRNSYS. 


I don't believe TRNSYS will directly do any LCA calculations. At least I have never tried. 


eQuest can do daylighting and natural ventilation, but it is not as accurate as using programs that specialize in these types of simulations. Also, I have never tried doing natural ventilation in eQuest for LEED without some support from a separate bulk air flow model for CFD analysis to support the results. I don't know how they will review the model without a supporting analysis outside eQuest.

FYI:

You might also want to dip into the simulation archives at LBL, which include all copies of the Building Energy Simulation User's News, found at:

http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/dirun/un_back.html

This will take you back to 1980.

Also, you'll find lots of papers and thesis at the ESL from the IETC, H&H and ICEBO conferences going back to the early 1980s.

Hi,

I am working on a preliminary LEED energy model for a six-story 500,000 square foot parking structure. The parking area is unheated. The major energy usage is lighting; followed by heating of stairs, elevator lobbies, storage, etc.

Do I have to consider a 25% process load? What would that be?

Thanks,

Hi Brian,

 

The 90.1 User's manual Table G-B, which I've come to regularly reference
for LEED projects instead of trying to force 25% process loads into my
models, lists parking garages as having a receptacle power density of
"NA" (distinct from the other entries).  If you are unaware of any
specific receptacle loads to include, I'd infer from this and the
accompanying text that you're not expected to model any.*  

 

Your process loads overall would still include any garage ventilation
fans, elevators, mechanical bollards, moving walkways, escalators, car
washes, mechanized street sweeping monkeys and so on.  

 

~Nick

 

* Small disclaimer:  The review process being what it is, nobody can
guarantee a reviewer that will force their personal interpretations down
your throat won't be assigned to your project.  The best you can do is
to document plainly any interpretations you have to make, and
cite/reference as you must to make your case clearly rational.

I agree, that was a tough exam, especially for somebody 10+ years out of school  :) , and especially when no reference material is allowed (unlike PE exam).

I did pass on first attempt, but here are some thoughts I had on the exam.

I thought the questions were fine. The test had good questions, and definitely tested our ability to understand very pertinent issues regarding building energy modeling.

And, now for my gripe :)

What made the test the toughest was how many questions had to be answered in the 2.5 hour period.  I felt very hurried on that exam and therefore quite frustrated when I finished.  I think it was like 115 questions in 2.5 hours.  That's not even 1.5 minutes per question, only 1.3

I answered the vast majority of what I attempted correctly, but did not have time to finish all of the questions.  

My recommendation would be to extend the total test time to 3 hours from 2.5 hours, giving slightly more than 1.5 minutes per question.

Delaying us getting to happy hour on a Friday by one half hour won't hurt anybody and give future testers a bit more breathing room to finish all of the questions.

Regards,  :)

Hello:

I can't speak to the LEED NC exam, but I can say that anyone who takes and passes the ASHRAE BEM Certificate really has to know something about building energy modeling, and probably much more. The ASHRAE Building Energy Modeling (BEM) exam was developed by ASHRAE in cooperation with IBPSA USA. IBPSA USA and ASHRAE have also developed a BEM workshop to assist in reviewing for the BEM exam, which I'd highly recommend as well. Dates for these workshops can be found on the ASHRAE web page, as well as the IBPSA USA web page, and other places.

As someone who has taken and passed the exam, I can say that it was one of the hardest exams I've taken in a long time. It really tested my knowledge of building energy simulation and, with so many questions, and so short a time, it really tested my ability to sit through such an rigorous ordeal, and answer questions one after another, in rapid fire. I was humbled by the experience, and I've taught simulation since the early 1980s.

Finally, it is my biased opinion that the building energy performance industry will soon begin to see the value in having "ASHRAE BEM Certified" simulators. Hence, I would strongly recommend giving this some serious consideration as a career enhancing opportunity.

Jeff

PS: I'd also consider taking the ASHRAE BEM workshop...a good warm up for the exam.

Thank you James. To extend the conversation... is HBDP still relavant, or
does BEMP take place of the certification for all practical purposes, for
energy modeling professionals?

Message-ID: <32245357.1284140478799.JavaMail.root@elwamui-milano.atl.sa.earthlink.net>

As some of you may know, ASHRAE is planning an energy modelling conference in April 2011 in Atlanta. The conference will be focused toward practitioners and one of the sessions will be on case studies.  I'm in charge of populating that day-long session on April 5, 2011.  I am looking for volunteers for this session.  The case studies should address issues of modelling real world situations, HVAC systems, architectural enclosures, control sequences, etc, and should be oriented toward overcoming perceived or actual limitations of currently available simulation tools.  The presentations are to be approximately 20 minutes in length, should have a Powerpoint component, and will be followed by Q&A session.  I am looking for 12 case study presentations.  Anyone out there got something they want to crow about?

If you are interested, please email me with your name, affiliation, contact info, and a 2 to 4 sentence description of your case study, including name of project, building type, and short description of the actual modelling problem overcome or issue illustrated. Thanks.

Message-ID: <5CFB01489F62D143B61289AF32DC98B1035C187B18@chi01exmb.perkinswill.net>

I'm looking at utility data for a building on a college campus that has a central utility plant. They list cooling energy in ton-hrs and It seems really high for all buildings across the board.

However - if you assume that ton-hrs is the metered chilled water usage and not the chiller energy, its not that bad. For example if the chilled water usage is 1 ton-hrs, that's 12,000 BTU's of cooling energy delivered. However, if whats being measured is chilled water usage (and not chiller energy), then 1 ton-hr is not the energy consumed by the chiller - that should be 12,000BTU/COP of the chiller. So if the chiller COP is 4 - then that's only 3,000 BTU's of energy consumed to deliver that ton-hr.

So - to get to the point - does anyone know if campuses monitor their chilled water usage (in ton-hrs) as chiller energy or cooling delivered?

  Chris,

In my experience, the impact of a green roof on the building energy is 
pretty small.  In the winter, the soil layer is reasonably saturated so 
isn't adding much insulation.  In the summer, there is some shading 
effect to reduce solar but it is difficult to quantify.

Attached is "Greenroofs in Canada" which includes a look at the energy 
impact of a greenroof on a building.  It does discuss some modelling but 
the increase in insulation value seems excessive to me.

Cheers,

Brian

I've usually seen this metric as chilled water usage at the building vs.
chiller energy. This goes in line with installing a Btu meeting for a
campus chilled water system, so you can define the chilled water energy
used at the building, similar to district steam.

Dear Vikram,

I think that the definition of ton-hours is inherently an "cooling energy
delivered" or "useful energy", metric.

I agree with James. Chiller energy would be measured in electric or gas units 
(energy input)..
?
Ton-hours is a load (useful energy) function.

Dear Vikram,
I think that the definition of ton-hours is inherently an ?cooling energy 
delivered? or ?useful energy?, metric.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] A Question about chilled water usage
?
I?m looking at utility data for a building on a college campus that has a 
central utility plant. They list cooling energy in ton-hrs and It seems really 
high for all buildings across the board. 

?
However ? if you assume that ton-hrs is the metered chilled water usage and not 
the chiller energy, its not that bad. For example if the chilled water usage is 
1 ton-hrs, that?s 12,000 BTU?s of cooling energy delivered. However, if whats 
being measured is chilled water usage (and not chiller energy), then 1 ton-hr is 
not the energy consumed by the chiller ? that should be 12,000BTU/COP of the 
chiller. So if the chiller COP is 4 ? then that?s only 3,000 BTU?s of energy 
consumed to deliver that ton-hr.
?
So ? to get to the point ? does anyone know if campuses monitor their chilled 
water usage (in ton-hrs) as chiller energy or cooling delivered?
?
(I hope this makes snese)

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Can Standby chillers be modeled in Energy modeling?
Message-ID: <20100913055746.GA71243@mail19j.g19.rapidsite.net>

Hello

 

Project requires total Air Conditioning load of 300 TR. It has installed a
screw chiller of 300 TR and also having standby chiller of the same
capacity.

 

So my question is, do we need to model 2 chiller in Propose case of 600 TR?
Or Only 1 will satisfy the ASHRAE requirement?

 

Thanks you for your suggestions.

 

Regards,

Ashraf

In my opinion, the standby one is not necessary to model in energy model,
whatever the standby pump or chiller, boiler, because as design it will not
operate as a proposed way, and the formal one can work well if there is no
any accident, ASHRAE has never asked to model a accident in HVAC system,
right? ;)

The main difference in winter insulation between green roof and the 
standard roof is the extra 1 1/2" expanded polystyrene panel 
"drainage layer" in the green roof.  If you add that to the standard 
roof and assume it is dry (as the analysis does) then it adds the 
extra R value and makes the comparison more equal.

I did not find it in Window 5's library just now.  I trust you've checked

Chris

Profilit and Reglit (datasheet for Profilit attached) is a U shaped glazed
wall element.

The last time we modelled this for a project we modelled it as a glass block
rather than a piece of glazing as the properties when you see it physically
are much more like a glazing brick.  It's translucent, but quite opaque.

I hope this helps.

This is a channel glazing system. Using it with nanogel infill gives you
a slightly better r-value.

I haven't come across the Pilkington Profilit glazing before.  I am
modelling a project that uses this glazing.  Has anyone come across
thermal performance information for this type of glazing?

Some points without any warranty ;-)

- It is an open system, you cannot evacuate it or fill it with any 
special gases

- There are several options to improve perfomance like reducing solar 
transmission or adding e.g. translucent insulation, coating inside 
surfaces,...

- For double-glazing, the heat transfer should be about 2.8 W/m2K in a 
simplified model. However, it may be interesting to have a closer look 
at the non-homogenous facade structure.

- Visible light transmission in the double-glazing setup could be 
assumed to be about 75% - however be aware of scattering, this is not 
clear glass and thus cannot be treated as such when you look into 
daylighting.

Cheers, Lars.

Lars,

That's exactly why we modelled it as a glass brick.  To be fair it's often
used outside of the conventional glazing system to provide architectural
features or in place of an opaque wall to gain areas of translucency into
deep plan areas where they would otherwise suffer from being miserable dark
corners.

Paul

Ah, yes I see what you mean.  We of course did a number of different studies
and so had to of course treat each study differently.

 

In terms of the thermal modelling, we looked at the glazing being
essentially a transmissive shading device - the "wall" we modelled was in
front of a curtain wall and so didn't effect the thermal performance of the
building too much, it was an architectural feature wall largely, but
obviously caused a major effect on the shading and also the airflow which we
had to account for as well.  Essentially we built an opaque shading device,
applied those properties of a glass brick to that device which would in
essence as you point out would see it as being fully opaque and therefore
light and solar transmission as being nil, but then we applied a
transmissivity profile relating to the small fraction of light/solar gain it
would allow through it.  This is relatively easily done in EnergyPlus.  The
other way to do it of course would be to make it glazed and apply a shading
coefficient or similar, based on the assumption you can't get the actual
breakdown of the glazing properties.

 

The other daylighting simulation required more careful treatment of the
specularity and light transmission values etc and essentially making it
diffusive, a bit like a ceiling light diffuser.  I'll see if I can find
copies of the models we built and the figures we used.  One was for a
previous employer so I'm not certain I have that model.

 

Hope that makes more sense

 

Paul

Paul,

You keep saying you modeled it like glass brick but what does that mean?

Did you consider its visible light transmission, its solar transmission or
both to be negligible?

Hello -

I am new to eQuest and have been trying to model a sports center in the DD
Wizard. I created the basic plan in autoCAd and was able to trace it in
eQuest. The building has multiple roof heights (flat roof).

My question are:

1) how do we model a building with differnt roof levels.

Thank You.

Pranita.

Pranita,

 

For eQuest, a model requiring multiple roof heights will typically
involve defining multiple shells using the DD wizard.  Whenever defining
multiple shells, it's most time efficient to define all aspects of the
first shell (not just geometries) before starting the 2nd, as you'll be
able to copy those inputs at that stage instead of re-entering
everything manually twice.  It is not a bad idea however to try creating
your shells defining only geometry first, as a "practice run," to ensure
you understand the process.

 

When defining adjacent shells - it's best to understand what eQuest will
actually do: the current behavior is to define adiabatic walls between
the adjoining spaces - changing those to 'air' or 'standard' interior
surfaces (in detailed mode, after the wizards) is necessary to model
heat transfer between the spaces.  

 

I've replaced the unrelated discussion below your query with a related
(identical) query from the [Equest-users] mailing list that should help.
The referenced posting by Scott Criswell is attached as well, and helps
to further outline the wizard's behavior.

 

For future reference, you are most likely to get prompt and helpful
responses for eQuest-specific queries on the [eQuest-users] mailing
list.  I'd also advise bookmarking the following archives as well as
another great resource while learning eQuest - as you are learning you
may find questions you come up with are already answered within:

Hello -

 

I am new to eQuest and have been trying to model a sports center in the
DD Wizard. I created the basic plan in autoCAd and was able to trace it
in eQuest. The building has multiple roof heights (flat roof).

 

My question are:

 

1) how do we model a building with differnt roof levels.

 

Thank You.

 

Pranita.

I would suggest side-to-side over stacked.

 

If you position via coordinates, and can get the adjacent planes to be
in the same locations, eQuest will recognize the coincident planes and
automate a number of things for you.  You cannot do this via stacking
shells on top of each other.

 

I'd suggest reviewing some specifics regarding how you go about
positioning your shells from this mailing list discussion.  I can't seem
to find it in the archive to link to, but Scott Criswell outlined some
pointers pretty helpful to the task at hand.  I've attached the
discussion for your review =).  

 

I'd also suggest bookmarking this archive search page if you haven't
already - you'll find more information regarding shell placement if you
find further trouble getting your shells to line up just right:

It might be easier to make the two shells stacked instead of
side-by-side. That way, you can specify that the top shell is open to
below and by zoning the bottom shell properly, you can make the part
with the high ceiling open to above. Just a thought.

Hello everyone,

 

I was trying to model a bldg with 50% area at 25 feet high and remaining
area at 10 feet. How can I specify different heights in  the footprint
of this bldg. in eQUEST?  I tried to draw in DD Wizard. First I drew a
footprint with 25-foot height, then I tied to create a new shell with
10-foot height. I wasn't able to put two shells together. Also, I didn't
know how to change exterior walls to interior. 

 

Any help would be appreciated .

What does the community think of mechanical / energy engineers running
airflow studies of air movement around and inside buildings using
Autodesk's Ecotect and Winair4 or NIST FDS? (If an individual can get the
programs to play together)
I touched on CFD and FEA in college and remember there is quite a bit to
it, epically when it comes to assumptions and boundary conditions.

Can a mechanical / energy engineer adequately analyze air movement in and
around a building with out training in CFD?
Or do you feel that this is an analysis that is best left for people who do
CFD simulations regularly?

Keep in mind that Ecotect and Winair4 and NIST FDS are limited in their
analysis capabilities, so we can limit the scope of this question to only
analyzing air movement due to wind / pressure in and around a building.
NIST FDS uses LES, I am not certain what Winair4 uses.

Dear Forum,

 

I think that most manufacturers offer too little, or no detail on their part
load performance.  For the energy modeler, I also think that it's asking too
much to fine tune a model with this level of detail unless you are trying to
compare two specific products.

 

The accuracy of any energy model is subject to a hundred (maybe 1000?)
details that are either: 

a)      Not known

b)      out of your control or 

c)       poorly documented

 

For a general model, the fine details of part load performance for one piece
of equipment cannot outweigh the uncertainty of the 100 other uncertain
details.

 

..now stepping off of the soapbox...

I believe that NRCan did some initial work on the impact of Green Roofs, the result was a reduction of heat island effect rather than building energy savings.

You could use EnergyPlus' ecoroof model to either determine an effective seasonal heat transfer rates with a basic setpoint controller, and incorporate that into eQuest somehow. You may find that the inputs for the E+ green roof model itself may be a bit of guess work. It might be more work than it is worth.

Shariq,

You have touched a very important issue: "importance of domain knowledge for
simulation".
You are very correct in saying that in CFD simulations, assumptions and
boundary conditions play a very important role in simulations. Therefore,
without proper understanding of CFD basics, it can sometimes even produce
'dangerously wrong' results.

Isn't it true for regular energy simulations too? To establish this, we did
one exercise with our students, after giving them only basic exposure about
energy simulation: gave same building to 15 students for simulation using
the same simulation tool, same air conditioning system. Results were varying
over a very wide range due to variety of variations considered by students:
e.g. CFM, chilled water flow rate etc.

Similarly, one CFD exercise of natural ventilation in buildings, when given
to 3 different students, produced significantly different results.

In my opinion, initiatives like 'Building energy modeling professional
certification' of ASHRAE is one possible answer to this issue. Similarly,
there may be one more program on 'Certified CFD simulator for buildings'.

Dear all,



I pretty much agree with what has been said. In order to provide a service
of consultancy, you need to be proficient in the tools that you use.

However, when it comes to architectural design, I don?t think this is
necessarily true. Architects rely very frequently on general principles and
performance-related decisions are usually takes using very simplified
information. The fact is that, even if we use simplified simulation to
support design decisions, the information will be always incomplete anyways.
Nevertheless, using simulation it will be less incomplete and more
responsive to design specificities.

Therefore, I believe that the use of simplified CFD tools (such as
DesignBuilder CFD module, IES-VE or TAS) can indeed provide to some extent
support to design decisions. The outputs of these tools are visual and the
settings are rather simple. Obviously, this is not intended to eliminate the
consultant job. Detailed analysis will be always done by consultants. But if
we have tools that can lead architects to make smarter choices...I think we
should try to use them.

Dear colleagues,

 

I am searching for a comparative study of models that derive direct and
diffuse solar radiation components from total solar radiation. I have
been using the Reindl model for many years and I am reasonable happy
with it. But,  I'd like to get a feeling what other models are available
and how they compare to Reindl. Any pointers would be appreciated.

Christoph,
   There is a good comparative treatment of those models in Duffie and 
Beckman's _Solar Engineering of Thermal Processes_ (chapter 2). My 
understanding is that the Reindl model is adapted best for south facing 
tilted surfaces (ie solar collectors) and that the Perez model is 
adapted for more general surfaces (building facades). There are a few 
different Perez models (updates that I am not sure are treated in the 
Duffie and Beckman book)
Best,
  David

I?d be a little skeptical that there wasn?t any edge effect taking place in
the actual building windows, whether due to frame or other method of
connection to the building envelope.

Jon,

It seems you mean the glazing has no mullions. However, it will still have frame at the edges where it connects to the wall- typical in case of storefront windows.

So to answer your question- the assembly and c-o-g values will not be the same. You'll have to model the whole assembly performance values.

If it is an NFRC rated glazing then you should be able to get the data from the manufacturer.

Our proposed design has exterior gas powered flame-torches for decorative
purposes.
The energy consumption of these torches could be significant compared to the
building energy consumption as it is quite a small building.
Has anyone had experience with this design from a LEED perspective. Does it
need to be included in the LEED model?
The preference is that it does not need to be included considering the high
energy consumption.

I think I'd tend not to include it but in any case it would be the same in

Chris,
 
My understanding of the intent of ASHRAE Standard 90.1 and LEED EAc1 is
that all building energy is to be included, so the energy needs to be
accounted for. I don't think you can exclude it just because it is
exterior to the building. You don't exclude other exterior features like
lighting and snow melt systems. I would consider an exterior gas-powered
decoration as either a process load, or an exterior lighting load. If it
is exterior lighting, the project may exceed the exterior lighting power
allowance (90.1 Section 9.4), which is a prerequisite. (Editorial
comment - If I worked on the project, I would take this approach to try
to get the torches removed, since I find the prospect of gas powered
decorations silly for any building, especially a LEED project.) If you
treat them as a process load, then you put the same load in baseline and
proposed. I think you have to include them if they fall within the LEED
project boundary, since all building energy use is supposed to be
covered.

Bill

I agree with Bill in that it definitely needs to be included.

On one hand, if the decorative burners are never mentioned in the project with LEED, then they wouldn't know to look for it - HOWEVER, that would be rather unethical given that as Bill mentioned, all energy consumption must be included in the model.

If the decorations are temporary and only for a very specific, one-off event for a short period of time then they could reasonably be excluded.

Given they are gas and not electric, I would not put them in as an electrical process load. The decorative burners could be added on not in the energy model itself but directly into the LEED Submittal Template. The Templates provide spaces to add extra inputs and extra/exceptional calculations. The energy use and cost could be manually calculated and then use the natural gas virtual rates from the project (or the actual gas rates of the actual fuel type) as long as they are in both the baseline and proposed case.

As long as your work is well documented and justifiable then it should be ok - but I would be prepare the client for a LEED Clarification on that regardless given its unique nature.

Chris,

My understanding of the intent of ASHRAE Standard 90.1 and LEED EAc1 is that all building energy is to be included, so the energy needs to be accounted for. I don't think you can exclude it just because it is exterior to the building. You don't exclude other exterior features like lighting and snow melt systems. I would consider an exterior gas-powered decoration as either a process load, or an exterior lighting load. If it is exterior lighting, the project may exceed the exterior lighting power allowance (90.1 Section 9.4), which is a prerequisite. (Editorial comment - If I worked on the project, I would take this approach to try to get the torches removed, since I find the prospect of gas powered decorations silly for any building, especially a LEED project.) If you treat them as a process load, then you put the same load in baseline and proposed. I think you have to include them if they fall within the LEED project boundary, since all building energy use is supposed to be covered.

Regards,
Bill

I think I'd tend not to include it but in any case it would be the same in either the proposed or baseline, a good reason not to include it.

Our proposed design has exterior gas powered flame-torches for decorative purposes.
The energy consumption of these torches could be significant compared to the building energy consumption as it is quite a small building.
Has anyone had experience with this design from a LEED perspective. Does it need to be included in the LEED model?
The preference is that it does not need to be included considering the high energy consumption.

Hello,

Does anybody know the difference between Table 6.8.1B and Table 6.8.1D. Which 
one should we use for packed terminal heat pump [appendix G system 2]. They 
definitely use different rating conditions, but how is a single package unitary 
heat pump different from a packed terminal heat pump.

Also, what would be the difference between an Air conditioner from Table 6.8.1A 
and a single ?package vertical air conditioner from Table 6.8.1D.?

Thanks for your comments.

kris

Dear colleagues,

 

I am searching for a comparative study of models that derive direct and
diffuse solar radiation components from total solar radiation. I have been
using the Reindl model for many years and I am reasonable happy with it.
But,  I'd like to get a feeling what other models are available and how they
compare to Reindl. Any pointers would be appreciated. 

 

Thanks a lot,

I second Chris Jones's comments. 

Whether the glazing is single or double, there will be regular joints in the
glazing which do produce edge affects. Some infrared images I have taken
show some very interesting differences, to the worse, between the basic
physical models and what really happens in a window.

Dear Kevin,

 

I am sure this is going to be a hot topic very soon. 

In Australia, the ASHRAE & other values have been used for some years with
regard to cavity insulation values. This includes subfloors, walls, roof
spaces and spaces between roofing and sarking. We have conducted a few
preliminary studies with Engineering honours and Architecture PhD students
on actual buildings. They have all shown dramatically different results to
what was previously accepted. In the case of walls this has a dramatic
affect on the current practice of placing the insulation on the outside of
the cavity. 

 

In terms of the roof model we have documented variations up to 20 deg C
between DSP and observed results. Subfloors having variations but to a
lessor magnitude. 

 

We are hoping for some future moneys to go back to the fundamentals of the
physics models and modify them to relate to what is really occurring in
buildings. We have measured amazing horizontal and vertical air currents in
cavity spaces dependent on wall orientation.

I am curious what the relationship is between cavity depth, rated

ASHRAE 90.1 doc because it is really the only one I have on this subject.  I
have charted Table A9.2B and a logarithmic trendline appears to be a good

Betreff: Window 5 and Energy+

 

Dear Sir or Madame,

 

I?m a student of Dr. Gerrit H?fker at the University of Applied Sience in
Bochum, Germany, and also a assistant in his engineering consultans. I?m
working at my
<http://dict.leo.org/ende?lp=ende&p=Ci4HO3kMAA&search=diploma&trestr=0x401>
diploma
<http://dict.leo.org/ende?lp=ende&p=Ci4HO3kMAA&search=thesis&trestr=0x401>
thesis which deals with window simulation.

I?m working with LBNL-Programs and our problem is the including of the
window outputs in ernergy+.

We just find the way how to save the window file as a "report type: 

energy plus" but we?re not able to load them into the appropriate 

energy+ file. I would be very please if could help me to solve this

problem, our to name a contact person who?s able to.

 

With the best regards

 

Sebastian Welter

 

 

Mit freundlichen Gr??en

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Assembly SHGC
Message-ID: <692109.85919.qm@web120216.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Hello All! I am confused to the formula that I found recently in the forum?on 
Assembly SHGC. I think its SHGCassembly = 0.08 + (0.86)(SHGCglass) (cant find it 
now in the forum but I think it is something like this) which gives me?a higher 
assembly SHGC of glass. Is this correct? I thought that assembly SHGC will be 
smaller than the SHGC of glass.

Thanks again to all!!

When you use WINDOW to calculate total window SHGC, you will find the SHGC
will be reduced compared as the glaze one. It looks reasonable to me since
the impact of  window frame has been considered. From this point of view,
the equation is not always correct.

I also calculated a frame SHGC of 0.57 (the formula is an area-weighting formula) and was surprised by that number (seems high).

The formula also assumes 86% of the opening is glass and 14% of the opening is frame. This certainly will vary. From a calculator I have, this would line up with a Kawneer 1600 curtainwall system using 3'x3.5' pieces of glass. I would think, you'd be more likely to see 3'x5' or 4'x6' which have 88% glass and 91% glass areas, respectively.

Using that formula, if you have a COG SHGC of 0.7, your assembly SHGC will go down. If you have a COG SHGC of 0.2, it will go up.

Hi Chris,

 

I quickly looked up EE4 and it says the calculations are based on
DOE-2.1E. If this is the case then TAS files wouldn't be able to be
imported into EE4 as TAS is not based on DOE.  TAS v8.5 uses RGO, BSO 3d
and BDF files where as DOE programs use BDL and INP files.

  Chris,

Unfortunately there is no way to import into EE4 at all.  While it runs 
DOE-2.1e as the calculation engine, the building data is stored in a 
.bld file (yes, that is correct, not a text .bdl as you might expect) 
which is not accessible.  I gather this is because it is first an energy 
code compliance tool.  So everything must be entered into the EE4 interface.

Note - depending on where you are, there is an EE4 training session 
scheduled for Toronto in November through the OSPE.

Regards,

Brian

Hi all,
The project is an New construction office building with a 30 tons ground 
source heat pump with a back-up boiler and Hybrid Hydronic Heat Pumps at 
zone level (total cooling capacity is 110 tons).

In EE4, when you model the plant as Combination Ground Source Heat 
Pump/Boiler, you can't choose a hydronic heat pump as system. So I 
modeled HHHPs as 4-pipe fan-coils. In heating mode, this will fairly 
represent the operation of the HHHPs (no condenser/compressor work) but 
in cooling mode it doesn't.

  DOE 2.1 converts the GSHP to an equivalent centrifugal chiller and 
electric boiler (with a modified COP). The problem here is that heat 
rejected by the chiller in cooling mode is not shared with the loop and 
cannot be used for space heating. The other issue is the loop 
temperatures. HHHP operate at a lower temperature than standard HPs.

How can you account for heat sharing in this case?

Anyone has a workaround for this situation?
Thanks

Hi Mark,

 

"How does one model process loads...?":  Generally - equally in the
baseline and proposed models, unless you are providing documentation to
demonstrate more efficient process equipment loads/scheduling than a
baseline (which you should also define/document).  I've copied a
previous query below yours which should help - there's more discussion
in the archives if you'd like to pursue.

 

If you mean "how" as in "how using eQuest," then you'll need to give us
more info regarding which program you're using and what loads you're
trying to model.  On a related note, I'd advise avoiding posting the
same question to multiple listservs as not all respondents will keep
abreast of the current discussion.

 

"...is it not required?":  This is an interesting question... & one I
don't have an immediate answer to.  If the issue is that you cannot
document the process loads for lack of information, that's why the 25%
minimum figure exists, but that doesn't sound like your current
situation.  I think it's implicit that you should be modeling all energy
consuming process loads, and documenting any efficiencies against
industry standards per the above/below, but to outright exclude a
manufacturing process might require leaning on an existing CIR... you
may get others to chime in with their experiences if you can describe
the nature of the loads/building more specifically (auto factory
machinery?  Lab equipment?  Airport conveyor systems?).

 

Best of luck!

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] LEED Process Energy Reduction

 

We have documented this on two projects - in both cases we had to
document what the industry standard for the process would be and then
how ours was more efficient.  One was related to conveyor energy usage
and the process integrator documented the expected savings based on
numerous other installations they had done over the past few years.  The
second one was the process energy associated with refrigeration -
through team member networking we surveyed approximately 200 owners of
buildings of a similar scope and use to document the baseline
refrigeration system that a building of that type would use.  Then we
documented how our system was different and more efficient.

 

In both cases this was approached with the alternative calculation
methodology of ASHRAE 90.1 and that section of the LEED template.  Hope
that helps!

Hello All,

 

I am currently working on several process intensive buildings. The
mechanical systems and corresponding control strategies that are being
designed are ideal for achieving 30%-40% savings in a standard office
building but I'm afraid that the common denominator, the high process
loads, will significantly reduce my projects savings. Has anyone
successfully submitted for a reduction in process load. If so, what/how
did you document the reduction?

 

Thanks for your time.

Message-ID: <4C93CA64.9030406@gmail.com>

  Has anyone investigated obtaining the EPAct 2005 tax credit for EE 
commercial buildings for private non-profits (503(c)(3))?  It seems like 
Section 3 in the 2008 amplification notice is pretty clear that the 
credit can be allocated for government-owned buildings, but does anyone 
have knowledge as to if this could apply to a 503(c) entity as well?

Also, would a) privately, or, b) government-owned mid & high-rise 
residential, or at least the non-residential portions of these 
buildings, be applicable?  It seems if 90.1 covers these structures, 
then the credit might be applicable too, despite the fact the title only 
indicates 'commercial'.

Any personal experiences or known sources for interpretations would be 
much appreciated.

Thanks,
David

Hello All,

I am trying to determine the impact that various energy conservation measures(ECM) have on the required refrigerant charge in a supermarket central refrigeration system. That is if they increase, decrease or have no affect on the design refrigerant charge. Is there a way to figure this out from the outputs of E+, doe2.2R or engineering calculations? The ECMs that I am looking at are floating head pressure, liquid heat exchanger, mechanical subcooling, condenser specific efficiency. 

Thank you,   

Haider.

Hi David,

 

1.       Off the cuff (I haven't delved into non-profit owners
specifically) - I'm pretty sure the ability for a building
owner/representative to re-allocate calculated deductions as it's
defined applies only to property owned by the (paraphrasing) "Federal,
State, or local government entities."  I'm pretty sure this is spelled
out in the 2008 IRS notice.  On the same token, I'd anticipate any
designers claiming re-allocated deductions from non-gov't building
owners of any sort may have some trouble, as the IRS hasn't explicitly
allowed them to do so.  A possible interpretation by an IRS auditor in
that case may be that you're trying to swindle a building owner out of a
benefit explicitly intended to reward them first.

2.       I would advise caution regarding any residential projects,
again off the cuff without looking it up...  EPAct is much, much more
than efficient commercial building tax deductions, and I could
definitely see potential for a problem if any overlap occurred with
local/state/federal residential-specific tax breaks being pursued
simultaneous to the section 179D commercial tax deductions you're
referring to.  I'd advise re-visiting the original 2005 EPAct
legislation to see if there's any clarification regarding what exactly
is "commercial" for the purposes of section 179D.

 

That's my take, hope it helps!  I'd be interested to hear your
conclusions when all's said and done,

 

~Nick

  Thanks for all the feedback.  After I submitted this, I did some more 
searching and found this list of FAQs on the credit:

http://www.efficientbuildings.org/about_the_provision.html

Although I have not yet gone to EPAct to confirm, this information is 
inline with comments made by others.  Here are the some applicable FAQs 
along the lines of the questions I posed:

*What types of buildings will qualify? What types of expenditures will 
qualify?*

Section 1331 of H.R. 6 provides that energy-efficient commercial 
building property is defined as property that is:

   1. Installed on or in any building located in the United States that
      is within the scope of Standard 90.1-2001, Energy Standard for
      Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings, of the American
      Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineers
      and the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America;
   2. Installed as part of (i) the interior lighting systems, (ii) the
      heating, cooling, ventilation, and hot water systems, or (iii) the
      building envelope; and
   3. Certified as being installed as part of a plan designed to reduce
      the total annual energy and power costs of interior lighting
      systems, heating, cooling, ventilation, and hot water systems of
      the building by 50 percent or more when compared to a reference
      building, which meets the minimum requirements of Standard
      90.1-2001 (which came into effect on April 2, 2003).


*Are churches eligible for the deduction?*

No. Although religious buildings are in 90.1 and they don't pay taxes, 
they are not government buildings, so churches don't qualify.

Thanks again for comments!

Haider,

You can do this using eQUEST. Search on the help menu for refrigeration
topics. You may have to load the eQUEST refrigeration version available on
the DOE2 website.

Good luck,

Hello,
 
The question has come up, how does one model process loads (Manufacturing not 
Plug loads), or is it not required to be part of the model. 


LEED says that default process energy is 25% of the total energy for the 
baseline building. If the the building's process energy is less than 25% of the 
baseline building, the LEED submittal must include documentation substantiating 
that process energy are appropriate. If the process load is more than 50% of the 
total energy consumption, what to do? 

 
Thanks in advance!

We are preparing for?a ?LEED submission and for Eac1,?right now, I only have the 
glass properties from?the window manufacturer which they have computed?using 
WINDOW and THERM, are these enough as back-up for windows properties? I am 
asking them to produce?the independent lab test results but it seems it may take 
sometime.?I notice that in some?discussion the modelers have only computed their

Dear Neeraj,

 

Building/solar orientation is a key factor. What was generally accepted to
be a relatively still air space was not. We have performed experiment twice
but a third time is needed to weed out some questions. I need to do some
more work in this area & publish our findings.

The phrase "air currents in cavity spaces dependent on wall orientation"

Though it'll be interesting to know more, perhaps changing solar radiation

Dear Kevin,

 

I am sure this is going to be a hot topic very soon. 

In Australia, the ASHRAE & other values have been used for some years with
regard to cavity insulation values. This includes subfloors, walls, roof
spaces and spaces between roofing and sarking. We have conducted a few
preliminary studies with Engineering honours and Architecture PhD students
on actual buildings. They have all shown dramatically different results to
what was previously accepted. In the case of walls this has a dramatic
affect on the current practice of placing the insulation on the outside of
the cavity. 

 

In terms of the roof model we have documented variations up to 20 deg C
between DSP and observed results. Subfloors having variations but to a
lessor magnitude. 

 

We are hoping for some future moneys to go back to the fundamentals of the
physics models and modify them to relate to what is really occurring in
buildings. We have measured amazing horizontal and vertical air currents in
cavity spaces dependent on wall orientation.

I am curious what the relationship is between cavity depth, rated
insulation, and effective insulation in framed walls.  I am referencing the
ASHRAE 90.1 doc because it is really the only one I have on this subject.  I
have charted Table A9.2B and a logarithmic trendline appears to be a good
fit for extrapolating.  If anyone in academia, industry, or the societies
has more information on this subject I would certainly be grateful to
receive a good lead.  Thank you.

Message-ID: <73479D5FEA249F439C67F905FF4FF9F0086BA66B@EXCH01.Horizon-Engineering.com>

Hi all

 

I realize that a new guidance document was released about a month ago
for dealing with District Thermal System, but I am in the process of
wrapping up a project that is using v1.0 of the Guidance for District
Thermal Systems, and I am getting a result that is really confusing me.
I apologize if this is repetitive, but I have browsed through the
archives, and while there was a lot of discussion on the DES Guidance
document, none of it seemed to address this particular issue I am
having.  This project is registered under LEED NC v2.2.

 

For my project, I modeled the first step as outlined in the document,
with both the baseline and proposed models using the central steam plant
for heating (cooling is covered by DX coils).  For this step, I am
seeing approximately a ~19% energy cost saving over the baseline model,
well over the minimum 14% required savings.

 

However, when I implement step 2 of the guidance, I set up the baseline
boilers as normal, and then set up a boiler for the proposed model using
the efficiency of the generating plant, accounting for thermal losses as
discussed in the document.  The central plant has an efficiency of
approximately 85%, and coupled with the thermal losses of 15% for a
closed loop steam system, I am looking at an overall efficiency of about
73% for the virtual steam boiler in the proposed model.  The boiler in
the baseline model has an efficiency of 80% per 90.1.  So, since the
efficiency of the proposed boiler is lower than the baseline boiler, it
should come as no surprise that the energy savings are considerably
lower, and since the building has high heating and service hot water
loads, the overall energy cost savings reduces to about 9%.

 

My question is, does this make sense?  I realize that the intention of
the document is to penalize buildings that use inefficient central
plants, but it doesn't make much sense to me that I am seeing such a
drop off in the overall result.  Am I interpreting something in the
document wrong, or setting something up incorrectly?  Or, is this the
expected result with a Central Plant operating at 85% efficiency?  It
seems like a plant would have to be near 100% efficiency to see much
additional benefit from using a central steam plant if this is the case.

 

Thank you all for your help

The project has 4 rooftop units, and one ERV that provides OA to the 
four roof top units.  Except the ERV only provides 50% of the minimum 
OA for each of the four rooftop systems.  DOE2.2 and DOE2.1e do not 
seem to handle heat recovery in a make-up air system using the 
OA-FROM-SYSTEM command.  The way I typically handle this arrangement 
is to prorate the heat recovery effectiveness and the ERV fan power 
to each of the 4 roof top systems.  The 4 rooftop systems have 
typical OA % for an office building - less than 50%.  My 
interpretation of 90.1-1999 Section 6.3.6.1 is that the ERV has more 
than 5000 cfm and more than 70% OA (the ERV is 100% OA), therefore 
the Budget building ERV requires heat recovery at 50%.  To model 
this, the Budget building will have prorated heat recovery at the 4 
roof top units - again because one can't properly model a make-up air 
system with heat recovery using equest (DOE2.2) or DOE2.1e.

Does this make sense?

Chris,

I assume you're doing an ECB model using 90.1-1999 to meet a local
requirement.

I interpret 90.1-1999, Section 6.3.6.1 differently. (For those without
it handy, the wording is, "Individual fan systems that have both a
design supply air capacity of 5000 cfm or greater and have a minimum
outside air supply of 70% or greater of the design supply air quantity
shall have an energy recovery system with at least 50% recovery
effectiveness.") The criterion to evaluate is for individual fan
systems. The ERV is not the fan system, the four rooftop units are the
fan systems. So, you only need to model heat recovery if one or more of
the rooftop units has 5000 cfm or greater of supply air and at least 70%
OA. You're saying the rooftop units have less than 50% OA (and I would
think they're much lower than that), so the baseline systems do not need
energy recovery.

I'm curious, how would you prorate the heat recovery effectiveness? I
frequently model air handlers as having their own ERV when they actually
receive OA from a common ERV.

Bill

Hi Bill,

Yes, in eQuest, only one system can be directly assigned to any given
zone.  However, it is possible to link 2 systems when one system is
dedicated to supplying another system with OA.  The trick is to make
sure that the DOAS is the FIRST system listed in the project component
tree; i.e. the DOAS has to be manually moved to (or created in) the
first position directly in the .inp file, not while eQuest is open.   In
order to satisfy the eQuest system requirement that at least one
conditioned zone must be attached to each system, a conditioned dummy
space/zone (with dimensions of 1x1x1) can be created to attach to the
DOAS which has no exterior or interior surfaces or internal loads of any
kind.  Once the DOAS is in the first position with the dummy zone
attached, on the OA tab of the rooftop unit, select the DOAS as the "OA
from System" in the pull-down menu for that data entry box.  The DOAS
then can model the heat recovery as designed as long as the system type
selected can model heat recovery.

The above procedure links two systems together so that OA can be
provided to a single zone from a separate system.

Good luck!

Hi Sheila,

I hope other people chime in on this. I have not received guidance from
others on how this requirement should be interpreted so I only replied
with what makes sense to me.

The problem in eQUEST is not with the system type. The problem is that
you have one DOAS supplying multiple fan systems. A thermal zone can
only have one system assigned to it. You can't assign both a DOAS and a
rooftop unit to a zone. You can select a system type that allows heat
recovery, but the heat recovery that you model is only for the capacity
and control of the single rooftop unit. So, whenever I have a DOAS
supplying multiple air handlers, I model each air handler as having its
own heat recovery unit. I think the biggest problem with modeling it
this way is that you can't put the system in ventilation-only mode. The
heat recovery can only operate when the air handler fans are running.

Bill

Good morning,

I have to agree with Chris' interpretation of Section 6.3.6.1.  An ERV
which is acting as a dedicated outside air system to provide OA to other
systems generally has both a supply fan and an exhaust fan.  Therefore,
it is considered a "fan system" and Section 6.3.6.1 would apply.  In
addition, Section 11.4.3(k) stipulates that each unit (including DOAS)
must be mapped on a one-to-one basis in order to determine the
corresponding Budget system type.  As such, if the Proposed building has
a DOAS, so must the Budget building.  In the Budget building, if the
DOAS has at least 5,000 cfm and 70% or greater OA, then the Budget DOAS
must model the 50% effective heat recovery.

In regards to eQuest:  What system type has been selected in eQuest to
model the DOAS/ERV?  We regularly encounter this set-up and model the
heat recovery on a DOAS all the time.  The inability to model the heat
recovery is most likely due to the system type selected.

Chris,

I assume you're doing an ECB model using 90.1-1999 to meet a local
requirement.

I interpret 90.1-1999, Section 6.3.6.1 differently. (For those without
it handy, the wording is, "Individual fan systems that have both a
design supply air capacity of 5000 cfm or greater and have a minimum
outside air supply of 70% or greater of the design supply air quantity
shall have an energy recovery system with at least 50% recovery
effectiveness.") The criterion to evaluate is for individual fan
systems. The ERV is not the fan system, the four rooftop units are the
fan systems. So, you only need to model heat recovery if one or more of
the rooftop units has 5000 cfm or greater of supply air and at least 70%
OA. You're saying the rooftop units have less than 50% OA (and I would
think they're much lower than that), so the baseline systems do not need
energy recovery.

I'm curious, how would you prorate the heat recovery effectiveness? I
frequently model air handlers as having their own ERV when they actually
receive OA from a common ERV.

Bill

The project has 4 rooftop units, and one ERV that provides OA to the 
four roof top units.  Except the ERV only provides 50% of the minimum 
OA for each of the four rooftop systems.  DOE2.2 and DOE2.1e do not 
seem to handle heat recovery in a make-up air system using the 
OA-FROM-SYSTEM command.  The way I typically handle this arrangement 
is to prorate the heat recovery effectiveness and the ERV fan power 
to each of the 4 roof top systems.  The 4 rooftop systems have 
typical OA % for an office building - less than 50%.  My 
interpretation of 90.1-1999 Section 6.3.6.1 is that the ERV has more 
than 5000 cfm and more than 70% OA (the ERV is 100% OA), therefore 
the Budget building ERV requires heat recovery at 50%.  To model 
this, the Budget building will have prorated heat recovery at the 4 
roof top units - again because one can't properly model a make-up air 
system with heat recovery using equest (DOE2.2) or DOE2.1e.

Does this make sense?

And thanks for all the help provided by this group!

Hi,

Does anyone know where I can find wind data for Niagara Falls? I am looking for wind speed and direction data directly adjacent to the falls. It is for a CFD analysis.

I have a weather file for Niagara Falls International Airport; however, I don't think this will be too accurate, as the airport is located approximately ten kilometers from the falls and the wind patterns will be quite different.

My site is on the Canadian side, directly adjacent to the falls. Any wind data for this area would be very helpful.

Thanks,

If most of your cooling loads come from internal loads as you said, then
having windows with a higher U-value allows the building to lose heat to the
outside any time it is cooler outside than inside.  If you look at ASHRAE
90.1, the requirements for windows changes dramatically as you move from
colder to warmer zones.  In warmer zones, the allowed U-value is higher, but
the SHGC is lower.

Also, it is usually good to verify that this is actually the case, often
installed equipment runs only a fraction of the day, or at a fraction of the
peak energy use.  If your internal loads are not actually as high as you are
modeling, this could change things.

Lastly, does the building have an economizer?  This may make sense for this
particular project.

Jaigath,

Karen is right on. Lower window U-values and additional insulation in walls and roofs can cause a net energy increase in buildings with high internal heat gains. If you look at the month-by-month consumption, you may see that the "better" envelope helps out in winter and summer, but hurts in spring and fall. The overall net effect over the year is sometimes negative.

When the air outside is cooler than inside, then some of the internal heat can get out of the building through the envelope. A more insulated envelope slows the heat escaping through the envelope, so more of the heat has to get out of the building through the HVAC system, resulting in more cooling energy. If there is an economizer ("free cooling"), the effect is not as severe the net effect of more insulation could be positive.

Hi Jaigath,

With such high internal loads, your building may be losing more heat through
the windows with the higher U-value of 0.7 and thus cause for less cooling
as less heat is built up within the building.

Thank you Karen, Joe,?and everyone?for?your advice.?

To answer your question if the building has an economizer,?no it does not have 
an?economizer. I have also asked the mechanical designer regarding the 
electrical load in his design criteria and he did confirmed that his assumptions 
are typical for this type of building. I am really tempted to adjust the 
electrical load because it is too high compared to typical offices and I agree 
with you Karen that?equipment do runs?only at a fraction of the day.


Thanks again,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Baseline and Proposed HVAC system
Message-ID: <AANLkTinidwQ4oLncafgFmrnM3X42K7MFipMmsNR1PXYA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,
There are two things that are confusing me right now:
1. I am trying to understand a comment that we recieved from GBCI regarding
the HVAC system that we used to model one of our projects. It is a existing
building with AHU's, Chillers, Electric Heat and FPB's with a square footage
of about 90000sf. I understand that the according to table G3.1.1B , the
HVAC system should be Type 6 and should have a direct expansion type cooling
and not a chiller for the baseline building. However, since the existing
building already has a chilled and the proposed would have a new more
efficient chiller, shouldnt i model the baseline with a chiller as well
since the existing building already has a chiller. Does anyone have
experience with this?
The renovation in the building is a major one.

2. Since the building is more than 5000sq ft , it has a mandatory
requirement of having occupancy sensors/motion sensors installed in the
baseline case. Now again, the existing building didnt have any motion or
occupancy sensors and did not have the LED lighting as in proposed building.
But since having the sensors is mandatory , do i not get any categpry for
having occupancy sensors? Also, if the occupancy sensors are to be modeled
should the percentage reduction in LPD to account for it in the simulation
from Table G3.2 be taken into consideration in Baseline as well as proposed
which would essentially mean that i would have no energy savings for
lighting?!!

Your help is highly appreciated.

Amit,
On your second question - as far as I remember (this is 2004 standard), the
mandatory occupancy sensors are on a space basis. So if you have occupancy
sensors in more spaces than what is mandatory, you can have the savings due
to them in these extra spaces. If the baseline does not have LED lighting,
then the proposed will have lower lighting wattage than baseline, giving you
lighting savings.

I realize this has already been hashed out, but in searching the forums it sounded like they didn't get resolved so I am asking anyway:

The building we are designing has a very high process energy use (60%) because of a large data center and the TV Studio equipment, lighting, and broadcasting.  The process loads stay the same in the building for the proposed and baseline case, so the difference in energy costs between the two (as a percentage) is very low.  Whereas, if the data center energy, broadcasting energy, studio lighting energy weren't included in the costs for the energy usage in the building, the difference would be greater, thus reporting just the difference in energy usage for the mechanical system and building efficiencies.
Is there a way to not count the data center and broadcasting type equipment electrical loads for EAp2?
Previous listings mentioned that in LEED 2009 they were working on creating baselines of process loads for different types of buildings that you could compare your process loads to.  Has that gone anywhere?
FYI:  I am getting 3 points for EAc1 right now, but if I were able to magically delete the extra process loads above the required 25% from both the baseline and the proposed design, I would earn an additional 3 points.
Thanks,

Jason,

 

There is no way to exclude process energy from EAp2/EAc1 calculations
under LEED 2009.  The only way you can improve EAc1 performance is to
document process savings relative to some baseline.  I'm also eagerly
awaiting some assistance from the USGBC/CaGBC/ASHRAE on baselines, but
I'm not aware that anything's been published yet.   

 

In the case of data centre energy, I thought about using Energy Star
Portfolio Manager to determine a baseline by entering a portion of the
modelled building as a data centre (less than 10% of area), but I
suspect that Portfolio Manager, being a bit of a black box, won't spit
out a separate energy intensity for just the data centre space.   I
think other modelers speaking on this issue have mentioned being lucky
enough to have clients with large data sets of previous projects that
they used for benchmarking various process loads.

 

It may seem unfortunate that, for the moment, high-process energy
buildings have a difficult time getting higher energy savings compared
to their low-process load counterparts, but if the goal is to reduce
building-related GHGs (as it should be), then it's probably about time
all energy use in buildings gets addressed.  Not that good intentions
help modelers much for the time being without some baseline values we
can use.

Hi Rohini,
i was addressing whats written in ASHRAE 90.1-2007 in section 9.4 for the
mandatory lighting standards. As i went through and had some inputs, what
appendix G really means is that we do not model the automatic lighting in
the baseline that makes the model with the maximum allowed LPD with a
schedule. However, in the proposed case the schedule remains the same but a
10% reduction on LPD could be done to account for the automatic lighting.

Now, my confusion is what Jorge said: "Your baseline for the renovation
portion of the work is in essence the existing conditions (envelope
components, equipment, layout, efficiencies, LPD, etc.)"
If that sentence were to be true than should i model the building with all
the pre-renovation values for envelope, LPD and consider that as the
baseline. Again, i have said this earlier that this is a major renovation,
and in the GBCI review, it has been clearly mentioned and i would
quote " Renovation
projects need to model the baseline case mechanical system following the
table G3.1.1A mapping as new construction projects" . The only point where
the existing values would hold good in a simulation would be on the envelope
side since in Appendix G #5 for Building Envelope, the (f) point
states that"for existing
building envelopes, the baseline should reflect existing conditions prior to
any revisions that are part of the scope of work being evaluated"

Please send me your suggestions and comments.

My opinion:
 
There are many tools that would be appropriate for this task.  eQuest,
TRACE, EcoTect and Green Building Studio, the plug-ins for Sketch-Up
from EnergyPlus and IES VE, etc.
 
For something this high level (conceptual pre-design and planning), I'd
personally lean toward using one of the plug-ins for Google Sketch-Up
(assuming you can get a conceptual site model in Sketch-Up).  Sketch-Up
allows for quick construction of a site and for visually impactful
presentations.  Since this is so high level with very few (if any)
design decisions actually having been made, the "black-box" nature of
these programs is acceptable for comparing alternatives.  Obviously as
the design progresses, the value of these tools diminishes.  Each of
these plug-ins is also free - and Sketch-Up is free as well.
 
I prefer the VE plug-in over the EnergyPlus plug-in because it allows
for zones to be constructed first - then assigned to a system and
analyzed.  The EnergyPlus plug-in required the masses be drawn with the
energy model in mind.  If you're working with an architect who uses
Sketch-Up regularly, the VE plug-in (likely) more closely resembles an
actual workflow for conceptual pre-design work.
 
I'd also take into consideration which tool I am more comfortable with
(don't know your experience level in energy modeling).  The plug-ins are
probably the easiest to learn in a short amount of time.
 
You can find YouTube tutorials for both the EnergyPlus and IES VE
plug-ins.  These are probably a good place to start if you want to go
that route.

Rob,
Are you asking what factors affect site design so that you can choose
one over the other, or is your question aiming at which programs can
best help simulate the factors that influence site design? Or is it
both? 
Just trying to understand..

Thanks for all the responses so quickly.  The site plans have not yet been
created, and the project is hardly a more than a project name, so my
question was meant to be very general.  I am expecting the "model" will be
more of a few generally sized blocks with various arrangements.
My personal experience is in mostly eQuest, but also Trane Trace and very
little time spent in GBS.

It seems like the google sketch up is worth some research as a potential
program.

thanks again for all the help,

Rob

Message-ID: <3C773A9872D3964899F8F6FE08F43C1F02BF7A3EAD@cn-exmbs-2.Corp.ClarkNexsen.com>

I am working on a calculation to demonstrate energy savings based on the use of low flow domestic hot water fixtures for LEED EAc1.  The "Advanced Energy Modeling for LEED" technical manual provides a sample calculation for this, but I cannot follow the method used to obtain the numbers presented.  For instance, for a lavatory with 3 daily uses, 15 sec duration, 1 FTE, and design flow rate of 0.5 gpm, the electric heated water usage is listed as 6 gal/day.  I would have expected 3 uses * 15 sec / 60 sec/min * 1 FTE * 0.5 gpm = 0.38 gal/day * some percentage of the flow being hot water = 0.xx gal/day; perhaps I am misunderstanding the calculation.

Is there a generally accepted percentage of total fixture flow rate for the hot water usage?  I am anticipating that the LEED reviewer will request justification for whatever hot water flow rate I use.

Thanks in advance.

I'd also support the suggestion to look into Sketchup, alongside the
IES-VE free plugin for sketchup.  

 

The tool is ideally used on very simple geometries ("blocks" sound
perfect), and will let you observe the effects of some of the earliest
design decisions - orientation, site location, comparing different
building massing and glazing configurations - in a time-efficient manner
once you have your feet wet.  There are a series of short videos on
youtube (I think linked from the IES website) that do a great job of
giving you a primer before you get started.

 

I'd also advise on simply planning to dump the models in favor of
eQuest/Trace when the time comes to investigate more in-depth/detailed
items... unless you happen to have a copy of IES's suite lying around
gathering dust of course =).  What I'm getting at is I've had very
little luck trying to take sketchup work and move it into another
workflow.

  Hi Shaun!

While it runs fine on 32bit versions of Windows 7, if you have 64bit 
Windows 7 you are out of luck as far as I am aware.

All,

The U.S. DOE Commercial Reference Buildings have been updated to version 1.3_5.0 and posted on the following Website:

http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/commercial_initiative/reference_buildings.html

As with the previous release, there are 3 vintages of 16 different building types modeled in 16 U.S. climates (3 x 16 x 16 = 768).  Users can download:


*         All 768 EnergyPlus 5.0 input files (.idf format)

*         All 768 EnergyPlus table output files (.htm format)

*         All 48 "Scorecard" spreadsheets for each building type in each vintage, summarizing input and output details

*         Zip file of the 16 TMY2 weather files used (.epw format)

*         List of changes in models between versions 1.3_5.0 and 1.2_4.0

*         Table of EUIs [kBtu/sf/yr] for all models in each vintage

*         Archived versions of previous releases for above files

We appreciate all the valuable feedback we've received from users of these models.  Much of it has been incorporated into the changes between versions.

Regards,
Kristin Field

Follow-up:  I had to install Windows XP Mode/Virtual PC,
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/ , and install EE4 in that
environment.   The install and Run as Administrator option doesn't want to
work on my 64-bit version of Windows 7.   I thought Microsoft had fixed all
this?

 

Thanks for the replies,
