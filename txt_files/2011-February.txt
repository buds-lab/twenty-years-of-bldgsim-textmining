I am working on a project with water source heat pumps in each zone 
and some zones also have hydronic infloor heating (it could be 
hydronic baseboard heaters as well)- running on the same boiler plant 
as the WSHP units.

As far as I can determine, you cannot model this directly with 
DOE2.1e nor with DOE2.2 (equest).  Has anyone developed a work around 
for such a situation?

Recently seen a number of weather file requests for hard to obtain
locations.
The cross-post below from the EnergyPlus list serv will be of use.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The EnergyPlus team can provide weather files created using Meteonorm. These
are posted on the EnergyPlus YahooGroup under Files >
Meteonorm_Weather_Files.

Locations are listed alphabetically by country. More than 280 locations are
currently available--look there first before asking for a new weather file.
Link to the file:
http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EnergyPlus_Support/files/Meteonorm_Weather_Files/Meteonorm_Weather_File_Inventory.xlsx

Information on selecting weather data is described in this paper:
Drury B. Crawley. 1998. "Which Weather Data Should You Use for Energy
Simulations of Commercial Buildings?" in ASHRAE Transactions, pp. 498-515,
Vol. 104, Pt. 2. Atlanta: ASHRAE. (PDF 197 KB)

PDF:
http://energyplus.gov/pdfs/bibliography/whichweatherdatashouldyouuseforenergysimulations.pdf

Requesting Meteonorm Weather Data for Your Location. Send the information
either to this group or to the helpdesk
(energyplus-support at gard.com<energyplus-support%40gard.com>
)

You will need to supply:

Name of Location (including country)
Latitude (N+/S-)(decimal format preferred)
Longitude (E+/W-)(decimal format preferred)
Time Zone (+/- GMT)
Elevation (meters)

For convenience, you can convert lat/long in degrees minutes seconds to the
decimal format by visiting this web link:
http://www.fcc.gov/mb/audio/bickel/DDDMMSS-decimal.html

And you should be aware of Meteonorm limitations:

Meteonorm extrapolates hourly data from statistical data for a
location. Where statistical data aren't available, Meteonorm interpolates
from other nearby sites. Generally a statistical approach is a last resort--
weather files generated from statistics will not demonstrate the normal
hour-to-hour and day-to-day variability seen in measured data.

Each .ZIP includes a .STAT (EnergyPlus weather data statistics), .EPW
(EnergyPlus weather file), and .INFO (Information about the source data and
limitations from Meteonorm).

IN ALL CASES, YOU SHOULD REVIEW THE .STAT FILE FOR THE LOCATION BEFORE
USING
ANY OF THESE FILES TO ENSURE THAT IT REPRESENTS THE CLIMATE OF THE LOCATION
AS
YOU UNDERSTAND IT. IN MANY CASES, A NEARBY LOCATION WITH MEASURED DATA MAY
BE
MORE APPROPRIATE THAN ONE DERIVED FROM STATISTICS.

YOU USE THESE FILES ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.

As always, if you know of sources of weather data that we might be able to
share with the EnergyPlus community, please contact us.

Karen,

 

You can download ARI 340/360 referenced in the rightmost column of ASHRAE
90.1 Table 6.8.1 A from
http://www.ahrinet.org/App_Content/files/standards%20pdfs/ANSI%20standards%2
0pdfs/ANSI%20AHRI%20340-360-2007.pdf (it's free). Section 6.1 of the ARI
standard reiterates that indoor fan power must be included in the rating,
which is consistent with definitions in 90.1 quoted by Nick. The section
also provides standard fan power of 365 W per 1000 CFM (see top of page 11),
which is used in eQUEST EER to EIR conversion paper that I emailed
yesterday. The equations in the paper are principally the same as in the
ASHRAE User Manual section that Sam sent to the forum, except the rating
conditions are used for fan energy.  

 

Thanks,

 

Maria

Hi Karen,

 

Apologies if I haven't been following closely enough, but I think you may be
unnecessarily complicating the issue for yourself. if in doubt, turn to the
90.1 glossary (section 3) regarding whether the efficiency metrics
are/aren't inclusive.  

 

EER is a simple ratio of total input power to net cooling capacity.  It
includes fan power.  SEER is the same idea, only it's weighted over a
"normal" annual period.  Again it includes fan energy.

 

While pulling the (calculated) baseline fan energy out of the prescribed
EER/SEER values may result in "unrealistic looking" efficiencies, that's
normal because fans are a big part of energy used by packaged equipment!  

 

Put simply and correcting your last statement:  All Appendix G baseline
model system types require fan energy calcs.  These energies can be
subtracted from the "fan-inclusive" EER/SEER efficiencies prescribed in
Section 6 to determine cooling EIR figures.  

 

Hope that helps!

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] ASHRAE Appendix G EER Calculation

 

Hi Sam,

 

I guess my question is the definition of "packaged" for the baseline system
case.  Systems 1 and 2 are very clearly packaged systems, with relatively
low fan power.  The fan power calculation reflects this, with much lower fan
powers for these systems.  However, systems 5 and 6 are called "packaged"
systems, but these systems typically serve a large portion of a building
with more extensive ductwork and higher fan powers (reflected in the fan
power calculation), subtracting out fan powers from these systems and
manipulating the EER of these systems results in very high EERs (upwards of
18???).  

 

It is unclear to me which air conditioners listed in section 6.8 have a
rating which includes fan power and which do not.  I am assuming that where
different "single package" and "split system" EERs are given, that the first
includes fan energy while the second does not.

 

Anyway, it seems that to model baseline systems, the simplest approach is to
choose the split system EER (if listed) in section 6.8, and calculate the
fan power according to the G3.1.2.9 guidelines.   Therefore, the only time
you would have to do the calculation mentioned by Sam is for a proposed
design system where the fan energy is included in the EER.

A 15-ton packaged rooftop single-zone system having an EER of 8.6 (COP of
2.5) is

specified for a building. The following table gives the design
specifications. How should

this be modeled?

Equipment parameter                               Value

Net Cooling Capacity (Btu/h)                   174,000

Total Packaged Unit Input Power (W)        20,128

EER                                                         8.64

Gross Cooling Cap (ARI conditions)         182,000

A

The supply fan power is the difference between the gross and the net cooling
capacity.

Supply Fan Power  = (182,000 - 174,000 Btu / h) / 3.413 Btu /W h =  2343 W

 

>From the equation for cooling system COP, the cooling provided by the
compressor and

the condenser into the airstream in Btu/h per Btu/h of electrical power
input is:

COP  = (182,000 Btu / h) / {(20,128 - 2343 W)* 3.413 Btu / W h } = 3.0

Some simulation programs use an energy input ratio (EIR), which is 1/COP. In
this case,

the EIR for this piece of equipment would be 1/3 or 0.333.

Hi All,

 

G3.1.2.1 in ASHRAE 90.1 says that "Where efficiency ratings, such as EER and
COP, include fan energy, the descriptor shall be broken down into its
components so that supply fan energy can be modeled separately."

 

However, I am a little unclear as to which baseline systems this applies to.
It seems that it would apply to systems 1 - 2, and not to systems 3 - 8?

Actually there may be an even better way.  We just announced at last week?s American Meteorological Society conference a new system that can provide EnergyPlus (EPW) files in any of over 600,000 locations worldwide.  We have essentially placed a virtual weather station every 35-km across the globe.  Each able to produce gap-free hourly weather for over 30 years and full TMY energy+ files on demand.  We have been working on this a long time and it is now available.  We do not interpolate or extrapolate but use the new high resolution NOAA/NCEP/CFSR and the NASA/MERRA data sets as our base.  In tests where we placed a virtual stations right next to certified met stations, the outputs were essentially the same.

If you are looking for energy+ data where you could not get it before, let me know.  The people who have tried it from all over the world have been very happy with the data.

Best,
Chuck

Recently seen a number of weather file requests for hard to obtain locations.  
The cross-post below from the EnergyPlus list serv will be of use. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The EnergyPlus team can provide weather files created using Meteonorm. These are posted on the EnergyPlus YahooGroup under Files > Meteonorm_Weather_Files.

Locations are listed alphabetically by country. More than 280 locations are currently available--look there first before asking for a new weather file.
Link to the file: http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EnergyPlus_Support/files/Meteonorm_Weather_Files/Meteonorm_Weather_File_Inventory.xlsx

Information on selecting weather data is described in this paper: 
Drury B. Crawley. 1998. "Which Weather Data Should You Use for Energy Simulations of Commercial Buildings?" in ASHRAE Transactions, pp. 498-515, Vol. 104, Pt. 2. Atlanta: ASHRAE. (PDF 197 KB) 

PDF: http://energyplus.gov/pdfs/bibliography/whichweatherdatashouldyouuseforenergysimulations.pdf

Requesting Meteonorm Weather Data for Your Location. Send the information either to this group or to the helpdesk (mailto:energyplus-support%40gard.com)

You will need to supply:

Name of Location (including country)
Latitude (N+/S-)(decimal format preferred)
Longitude (E+/W-)(decimal format preferred)
Time Zone (+/- GMT)
Elevation (meters)

For convenience, you can convert lat/long in degrees minutes seconds to the decimal format by visiting this web link:
http://www.fcc.gov/mb/audio/bickel/DDDMMSS-decimal.html

And you should be aware of Meteonorm limitations:

Meteonorm extrapolates hourly data from statistical data for a 
location. Where statistical data aren't available, Meteonorm interpolates 
from other nearby sites. Generally a statistical approach is a last resort--
weather files generated from statistics will not demonstrate the normal
hour-to-hour and day-to-day variability seen in measured data.

Each .ZIP includes a .STAT (EnergyPlus weather data statistics), .EPW 
(EnergyPlus weather file), and .INFO (Information about the source data and 
limitations from Meteonorm). 

IN ALL CASES, YOU SHOULD REVIEW THE .STAT FILE FOR THE LOCATION BEFORE USING 
ANY OF THESE FILES TO ENSURE THAT IT REPRESENTS THE CLIMATE OF THE LOCATION AS 
YOU UNDERSTAND IT. IN MANY CASES, A NEARBY LOCATION WITH MEASURED DATA MAY BE 
MORE APPROPRIATE THAN ONE DERIVED FROM STATISTICS. 

YOU USE THESE FILES ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.

As always, if you know of sources of weather data that we might be able to 
share with the EnergyPlus community, please contact us.

Hi Karen,

 

The glossary definitions I'm summing up below include specifically:

-          seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SSEER)

-          energy efficiency ratio (EER)

 

There are also definitions for the various sorts of COP and seasonal
COP.  Unless noted otherwise, assume any reference to these efficiency
metrics elsewhere in the standard follow these definitions.

 

My suggestion is merely a reminder that the definitions are always a
good place to start or review when in doubt - I personally return often
to verify things whenever I have to make interpretations or cite the
standard.

 

Best of luck!

Karen,

 

You can download ARI 340/360 referenced in the rightmost column of
ASHRAE 90.1 Table 6.8.1 A from 
http://www.ahrinet.org/App_Content/files/standards%20pdfs/ANSI%20standar
ds%20pdfs/ANSI%20AHRI%20340-360-2007.pdf (it's free). Section 6.1 of the
ARI standard reiterates that indoor fan power must be included in the
rating, which is consistent with definitions in 90.1 quoted by Nick. The
section also provides standard fan power of 365 W per 1000 CFM (see top
of page 11), which is used in eQUEST EER to EIR conversion paper that I
emailed yesterday. The equations in the paper are principally the same
as in the ASHRAE User Manual section that Sam sent to the forum, except
the rating conditions are used for fan energy.  

 

Thanks,

 

Maria

Hi Karen,

 

Apologies if I haven't been following closely enough, but I think you
may be unnecessarily complicating the issue for yourself... if in doubt,
turn to the 90.1 glossary (section 3) regarding whether the efficiency
metrics are/aren't inclusive.  

 

EER is a simple ratio of total input power to net cooling capacity.  It
includes fan power.  SEER is the same idea, only it's weighted over a
"normal" annual period.  Again it includes fan energy.

 

While pulling the (calculated) baseline fan energy out of the prescribed
EER/SEER values may result in "unrealistic looking" efficiencies, that's
normal because fans are a big part of energy used by packaged equipment!


 

Put simply and correcting your last statement:  All Appendix G baseline
model system types require fan energy calcs.  These energies can be
subtracted from the "fan-inclusive" EER/SEER efficiencies prescribed in
Section 6 to determine cooling EIR figures.  

 

Hope that helps!

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] ASHRAE Appendix G EER Calculation

 

Hi Sam,

 

I guess my question is the definition of "packaged" for the baseline
system case.  Systems 1 and 2 are very clearly packaged systems, with
relatively low fan power.  The fan power calculation reflects this, with
much lower fan powers for these systems.  However, systems 5 and 6 are
called "packaged" systems, but these systems typically serve a large
portion of a building with more extensive ductwork and higher fan powers
(reflected in the fan power calculation), subtracting out fan powers
from these systems and manipulating the EER of these systems results in
very high EERs (upwards of 18???).  

 

It is unclear to me which air conditioners listed in section 6.8 have a
rating which includes fan power and which do not.  I am assuming that
where different "single package" and "split system" EERs are given, that
the first includes fan energy while the second does not.

 

Anyway, it seems that to model baseline systems, the simplest approach
is to choose the split system EER (if listed) in section 6.8, and
calculate the fan power according to the G3.1.2.9 guidelines.
Therefore, the only time you would have to do the calculation mentioned
by Sam is for a proposed design system where the fan energy is included
in the EER.

A 15-ton packaged rooftop single-zone system having an EER of 8.6 (COP
of 2.5) is

specified for a building. The following table gives the design
specifications. How should

this be modeled?

Equipment parameter                               Value

EER                                                         8.64

Gross Cooling Cap (ARI conditions)         182,000

A

The supply fan power is the difference between the gross and the net
cooling capacity.

Supply Fan Power  = (182,000 - 174,000 Btu / h) / 3.413 Btu /W h =  2343
W

 

>From the equation for cooling system COP, the cooling provided by the

the condenser into the airstream in Btu/h per Btu/h of electrical power
input is:

COP  = (182,000 Btu / h) / {(20,128 - 2343 W)* 3.413 Btu / W h } = 3.0

Some simulation programs use an energy input ratio (EIR), which is
1/COP. In this case,

the EIR for this piece of equipment would be 1/3 or 0.333.

Message-ID: <AANLkTikxRJuwYRqYDnd_fSYc1+ML0R3=Y4jBjnvhav8F@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,
While modelling existing building (with calibration to utility bill), do you
model every VAV zone or lump similar ones together? What could be possible
disadvantages of lumping down the road? Any ECM's that will be affected by
this simplification?
Is there a magical way to figure the W/sqft for lighting and plug loads
without having to count everything on site?
Thanks for any insights.

I think most of them can to varying degrees, certainly DOE2 and EnergyPlus
can.  Your challenge will be getting good infiltration inputs.

Ragab,

In E+, you may be able to use the "NoMass" material for lightweight 
fabric constructions. I've /not /got direct experience of using the 
NoMass material but it seems the most common sense approach when thermal 
mass is insignificant.

How well controlled is airflow? The less controlled (i.e. more natural 
ventilation) the more computationally intense and error prone the solution.

Hi Ragab,

Very interesting topic. My two cents only since I have not done any
temporary structures before. The critical parameters which will infuence
the thermal performance of temporary structuse, to my knowledge, are the U
value of facade materials,  infiltration/exfiltration, ground effect. As
long as they can be accurately described in a simulation program, it is
highly possible to simulate temporary structures.

IES VE, TAS, Energy Plus, etc. all certainly have the capacity to do it.
Since thermal mass effect may not be significant in these temperary
structures, DOE2 based progame may also be capable of simulating them.

Cheney

Hi,

 Does anyone have problems using "no mass materials" to reach the
convergence tolerance? I've heard about that in extremely lightweight
simulations buildings.

Message-ID: <245385.42981.qm@web130103.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I am doing a research project examining the characteristics of commercial 
buildings in Saudi Arabia. Is there any good source for establishing my baseline 
buildings to reflect the existing commercial building stock?

I am after the typical HVAC systems, envelope properties, occupancy and usage 
patterns of a wide variety of commercial buildings from offices to warehouses, 
schools to retail; and even the tiniest bit of information would be highly 
appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

Dogan

In that case, you may also be able to utilise some of the stratified 
zone models (if the space is tall). From memory, they aren't coupled to 
the airflow network but they will work with HVAC.

Somebody posted a comment regarding convergence tolerances of no mass 
materials. I can't really comment on this apart from re-iterating that 
E+ has a model for purely resistive (i.e. no thermal mass) materials. I 
know other simulation programs do have problems with convergence in very 
thin opaque elements because you can't turn of the thermal mass.

It's a little bit of an untested area this so expect to spend some time.

Hi Rohini,

When you are bill matching there are not magical ways of doing things. You
pretty much have to put what's in the building in your model. Those things
you can control. The tricky part is to figure out how the building is really
being operated and to get the most accurate weather data you can for your
site.

Cheers,

Carol

Rohini,



Zoning a building is still an art form. There are very few papers that have looked into this with any rigor.



In one thesis we did on the Zachry building, which was the basis for the Predictor Shootout I and II, we looked at 1, 2, 5 and actual zoning on the building. What we saw was that, in general, the centroid of the "cloud" of data points remained about the same. However, the scatter in the cloud became more  pronounced at we added more zones.



So, if all the zones in the floor are being operated the same, I'd use 1, 2 or 5 zones per floor, depending on the functions of what's going on in each zone. Real walls or air walls between the zones usually get the job done.



The quickest way to get the light and receptacle loads on a real building is using "blink" tests, which can be done on a Saturday, with walkie talkies, and a data logger on the whole-building electric feed, possibly some sub feeds. I first heard of this test from Todd Taylor at PNNL. We've used it to help resolved motor loads, lighting loads, receptacles, etc. Seems to work pretty well.



There are also several ways to get the plug loads, including: by proxy, by weather-day-type profiles, by daily readings, and a method that uses an energy balance. The proxy methods can use square proxies for for the occupancy based on OLF/ELF ratios, the weather-day-type method was something that I heard about from Don Hadley at PNNL, later adopted by Bou Saada on the Forrestal building and daycare center. The daily readings are just that, read the main meter by eye, daily, especially during weather independent times. The energy balance method is documented in papers by Claridge et al. at the ESL.



There is also some encouraging work being done by Abushakra and Reddy on ASHRAE RP 1404, now in progress and scheduled for completion later this year. This is based on previous work by Abushakra for his Ph.D. thesis.



Hope this helps.

ONE MORE...



BTW, there's one more paper that is worth point out because it is one of the first articles that I recall that pointed to the fact that the "final" values for a simulation input parameters may have little to do with the nominal values that are first observed and entered. That paper was presented at the 1996 ASME conference in San Antonio, TX.



The citation is:



Manke, J., Hittle, D. and Hancock, C., 1996. "Calibration Building Energy Analysis Models Using Short-term Test Data", Proceedings of the 1996 ASME Solar Energy Conference, p. 369, San Antonio, TX.



This study reviewed a conference center in Gunnison, CO, using BLAST, and another buidling. In this paper they showed that strange things happen when you do a "blind" best fit for various parameters. However, at the end of the effort, they had a much improved fit of the simulation output to the measured data. For example, such things as the UA of a wall or floor might actually give better simulation results if it was 10, 100 or 1000x what the nominal value was. In general, they use a 0.1x to 10x approach to systematically explore different variables until they got the best fit to some short term data.



So, the point of bringing this into the ongoing discussion, is that when a simulator is "fitting" a simulation to measured data, hopefully some short-term measured data, don't be surprised if the "final" values of the parameters are totally unrealistic as this may be indicating a physical characteristic that is not being well represented by the model (i.e., an interior convection coefficient), and in fact is better modeled when the input parameter is completely "empirical", sometimes being 0.01x, 0.1x, 1x, 10x, 100x or 1000x the known value. Weird stuff indeed, but worth keeping in the back of you mind as you calibrate your simulation!

Hi Rohini,

When you are bill matching there are not magical ways of doing things. You pretty much have to put what's in the building in your model. Those things you can control. The tricky part is to figure out how the building is really being operated and to get the most accurate weather data you can for your site.

Cheers,

Carol

Hi All,
While modelling existing building (with calibration to utility bill), do you model every VAV zone or lump similar ones together? What could be possible disadvantages of lumping down the road? Any ECM's that will be affected by this simplification?
Is there a magical way to figure the W/sqft for lighting and plug loads without having to count everything on site?
Thanks for any insights.
-Rohini

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=egbaH1deEOKYWsBwMakS6yKsbEYXH0k7sL7oG@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

According to the District Thermal Energy v2 document on the treatment of
campus plants, the baseline systems have to altered in concert with the
changes provided in Table 3 of the document.

In Table 3, System 3 of Appendix-G is revised as a *4-pipe CV AHU*, if the
proposed system uses district energy for both cooling and heating.

My question is - Does 4-pipe CV AHU mean a single constant volume air
handler for the whole building? or would it again be single-zone systems as
System 3 of Appendix-G was supposed to be?

It would be great if anyone can throw some light on this.

Thank you.

Regards,
Vinay

Dear Jeff,


You mention the use of "Real walls or _*air walls*_" between zones in 
your post. I feel this raises a question on this list that I've already 
enquired on this list. I apologise for raising the issue once more, 
however I did not feel that the discussion resulted in a clear 
conclusion of how various simulation programs may treat "Air walls" or 
"virtual partitions".


I hope you don't mind me asking:

    * what programs do you use mainly?
    * under normal modelling practice, how would these programs treat
      "air walls" with respect to:
          o Conduction
          o Long-wave radiation
          o Short-wave radiation
          o Air flow

Many thanks

Chris

Hi all,

  I would like to add a question to the list:

  - Air wall works the same when apllied in a between zones face or in
an outdoor face?
thanks

Hi all,
 
 
In DOE-2 program, "air wall" is a type of interior walls without thermal mass effect, only for thermal resistance(0.9 hr-ft2-F/btu) between zones. I think other similar simulation programs have also the same function.

Hi all,
 
  I would like to add a question to the list:
 
  - Air wall works the same when apllied in a between zones face or in an outdoor face?

thanks

Dear Jeff,


You mention the use of "Real walls or air walls" between zones in your post. I feel this raises a question on this list that I've already enquired on this list. I apologise for raising the issue once more, however I did not feel that the discussion resulted in a clear conclusion of how various simulation programs may treat "Air walls" or "virtual partitions".

I hope you don't mind me asking: 


what programs do you use mainly?
under normal modelling practice, how would these programs treat "air walls" with respect to:

 Conduction
Long-wave radiation
Short-wave radiation
Air flowMany thanks

Rohini,
 
Zoning a building is still an art form. There are very few papers that have looked into this with any rigor. 
 
In one thesis we did on the Zachry building, which was the basis for the Predictor Shootout I and II, we looked at 1, 2, 5 and actual zoning on the building. What we saw was that, in general, the centroid of the "cloud" of data points remained about the same. However, the scatter in the cloud became more  pronounced at we added more zones.
 
So, if all the zones in the floor are being operated the same, I'd use 1, 2 or 5 zones per floor, depending on the functions of what's going on in each zone. Real walls or air walls between the zones usually get the job done.
 
The quickest way to get the light and receptacle loads on a real building is using "blink" tests, which can be done on a Saturday, with walkie talkies, and a data logger on the whole-building electric feed, possibly some sub feeds. I first heard of this test from Todd Taylor at PNNL. We've used it to help resolved motor loads, lighting loads, receptacles, etc. Seems to work pretty well. 
 
There are also several ways to get the plug loads, including: by proxy, by weather-day-type profiles, by daily readings, and a method that uses an energy balance. The proxy methods can use square proxies for for the occupancy based on OLF/ELF ratios, the weather-day-type method was something that I heard about from Don Hadley at PNNL, later adopted by Bou Saada on the Forrestal building and daycare center. The daily readings are just that, read the main meter by eye, daily, especially during weather independent times. The energy balance method is documented in papers by Claridge et al. at the ESL.
 
There is also some encouraging work being done by Abushakra and Reddy on ASHRAE RP 1404, now in progress and scheduled for completion later this year. This is based on previous work by Abushakra for his Ph.D. thesis.
 
Hope this helps.
 
Jeff

Hi Rohini, 


When you are bill matching there are not magical ways of doing things. You pretty much have to put what's in the building in your model. Those things you can control. The tricky part is to figure out how the building is really being operated and to get the most accurate weather data you can for your site.


Cheers,


Carol

Hi,

  Is it possible to simulate an open door or a open window in a face with
outdoors boundary conditions? (only calculating heat loss or gains to the
enviroment). Example: If I apply a "infrared transparent' in a exterior
window, does it works as a open window, for energy balance calculation?

Sorry about my english.

Thanks,
Francisco Massucci

This thread appears to have tangented into 3+ different directions... if
you have a new inquiry please start a new  email chain =)!

 

Fransisco - you should refine your questions by specifying which program
you intend to use, or if your inquiry is of the "is there a program that
can do this?" variety.  Air walls in eQuest/DOE2 behave as Suwon is
describing.  They are a type of interior partition and will not model
heat transfer to the exterior, regardless of their geometrical location.

 

Chris - I use eQuest/DOE2 primarily.  Please refer to recent discussion
on [eQuest-users] where I attempted to sum up air wall behavior in both
layman's and complex terms (discussion attached).  

 

To my understanding DOE2/eQuest models do not model heat transfer
explicitly by either convection or radiation - all heat movement within
the model is calculated as a series of direct (conductive) transfers
between zone surfaces (interior and exterior) on an hourly basis.  Air
walls are unique type of surface in that they have zero mass but a
relatively low conductivity (by default, approximately the same as a
single layer of 3/8" Gypsum), however this value can be modified as may
be desired.  

 

To Rohini - My existing model calibration experience is probably limited
relative to others contributing - but I can share the general
observation/advice that your models can only ever be as accurate as your
gathered data, or lack thereof.  An important corollary I want to
emphasize is that models ultimately serve a purpose, and that it's
important at the beginning of any project to identify that endgame.
Sometimes it's getting LEED points, sometimes it's advising new or
retrofit design for existing envelopes, HVAC, and/or lighting, sometimes
it's because there's academics who simply want a model they can pick up
after you to tweak to perfection as time goes on... 

 

Defining where the model is headed in terms of intent will permit you to
define a degree/deadband of acceptable accuracy.  Without doing so, you
may lose sanity/sleep to the beast before realizing you don't have a
finish line defined.

Hi,

 

  Is it possible to simulate an open door or a open window in a face
with outdoors boundary conditions? (only calculating heat loss or gains
to the enviroment). Example: If I apply a "infrared transparent' in a
exterior window, does it works as a open window, for energy balance
calculation?

 

Sorry about my english.

Hi all,
 
 
In DOE-2 program, "air wall" is a type of interior walls without thermal
mass effect, only for thermal resistance(0.9 hr-ft2-F/btu) between
zones. I think other similar simulation programs have also the same
function.

Dear Jeff,


You mention the use of "Real walls or air walls" between zones in your
post. I feel this raises a question on this list that I've already
enquired on this list. I apologise for raising the issue once more,
however I did not feel that the discussion resulted in a clear
conclusion of how various simulation programs may treat "Air walls" or
"virtual partitions".


I hope you don't mind me asking: 

*	what programs do you use mainly?
*	under normal modelling practice, how would these programs treat
"air walls" with respect to:

	*	 Conduction
	*	Long-wave radiation
	*	Short-wave radiation
	*	Air flow

Many thanks

Rohini,
 
Zoning a building is still an art form. There are very few papers that
have looked into this with any rigor. 
 
In one thesis we did on the Zachry building, which was the basis for the
Predictor Shootout I and II, we looked at 1, 2, 5 and actual zoning on
the building. What we saw was that, in general, the centroid of the
"cloud" of data points remained about the same. However, the scatter in
the cloud became more  pronounced at we added more zones.
 
So, if all the zones in the floor are being operated the same, I'd use
1, 2 or 5 zones per floor, depending on the functions of what's going on
in each zone. Real walls or air walls between the zones usually get the
job done.
 
The quickest way to get the light and receptacle loads on a real
building is using "blink" tests, which can be done on a Saturday, with
walkie talkies, and a data logger on the whole-building electric feed,
possibly some sub feeds. I first heard of this test from Todd Taylor at
PNNL. We've used it to help resolved motor loads, lighting loads,
receptacles, etc. Seems to work pretty well. 
 
There are also several ways to get the plug loads, including: by proxy,
by weather-day-type profiles, by daily readings, and a method that uses
an energy balance. The proxy methods can use square proxies for for the
occupancy based on OLF/ELF ratios, the weather-day-type method was
something that I heard about from Don Hadley at PNNL, later adopted by
Bou Saada on the Forrestal building and daycare center. The daily
readings are just that, read the main meter by eye, daily, especially
during weather independent times. The energy balance method is
documented in papers by Claridge et al. at the ESL.
 
There is also some encouraging work being done by Abushakra and Reddy on
ASHRAE RP 1404, now in progress and scheduled for completion later this
year. This is based on previous work by Abushakra for his Ph.D. thesis.
 
Hope this helps.
 
Jeff

Hi Rohini, 

 

When you are bill matching there are not magical ways of doing things.
You pretty much have to put what's in the building in your model. Those
things you can control. The tricky part is to figure out how the
building is really being operated and to get the most accurate weather
data you can for your site.

 

Cheers,

 

Carol

All,

 

I'm using eQUEST version 3.64, and when I switch from WYEC2 weather data
sets to TMY2 data sets, the simulation pauses halfway through and will
not finish.  The SIM file and the BDL file both get generated during the
partial simulation, but neither show any errors or warnings.

 

Has anyone else seen this behavior with TMY2 weather files in version
3.64?

 

Thanks,

I'm surprised that you're experiencing difficulties with TMY2 data, 
since they've been around for 15 years. Which weather file were you using?
The only time I've ever experienced with DOE-2 stopping due to a weather 
file was when the file had bad psychrometrics that were outside of
physical possibility.

Sorry Nick, my bad regarding the tangent. What you've described in 
eQuest seems synonymous with the NoMass material in Energyplus.

Perhaps I can bring it a little bit back on topic. Jeff mentions the use 
of Air walls to model existing buildings. However, if you know where all 
the partitions are in an /existing/ building don't they introduce 
artificial boundaries?

Hi Chris,
 
In most building energy simulation programs including DOE-2, It is impossible to define two different HVAC systems in one thermal zone. Therefore, it is sometimes useful to seperate one actural zone into two thermal zones(e.g. interior zone and perimeter zone) using an articificial boundary like 'air wall' when an actual one zone in existinfg building has two different systems, for example, VAV system is for a interior zone, and fan coil unit is for a perimeter zone.

Hi,

 

  Is it possible to simulate an open door or a open window in a face with outdoors boundary conditions? (only calculating heat loss or gains to the enviroment). Example: If I apply a "infrared transparent' in a exterior window, does it works as a open window, for energy balance calculation?

 

Sorry about my english.

under normal modelling practice, how would these programs treat "air walls" with respect to:


 Conduction
Long-wave radiation
Short-wave radiation
Air flow
Many thanks

Rohini,
 
Zoning a building is still an art form. There are very few papers that have looked into this with any rigor. 
 
In one thesis we did on the Zachry building, which was the basis for the Predictor Shootout I and II, we looked at 1, 2, 5 and actual zoning on the building. What we saw was that, in general, the centroid of the "cloud" of data points remained about the same. However, the scatter in the cloud became more  pronounced at we added more zones.
 
So, if all the zones in the floor are being operated the same, I'd use 1, 2 or 5 zones per floor, depending on the functions of what's going on in each zone. Real walls or air walls between the zones usually get the job done.
 
The quickest way to get the light and receptacle loads on a real building is using "blink" tests, which can be done on a Saturday, with walkie talkies, and a data logger on the whole-building electric feed, possibly some sub feeds. I first heard of this test from Todd Taylor at PNNL. We've used it to help resolved motor loads, lighting loads, receptacles, etc. Seems to work pretty well. 
 
There are also several ways to get the plug loads, including: by proxy, by weather-day-type profiles, by daily readings, and a method that uses an energy balance. The proxy methods can use square proxies for for the occupancy based on OLF/ELF ratios, the weather-day-type method was something that I heard about from Don Hadley at PNNL, later adopted by Bou Saada on the Forrestal building and daycare center. The daily readings are just that, read the main meter by eye, daily, especially during weather independent times. The energy balance method is documented in papers by Claridge et al. at the ESL.
 
There is also some encouraging work being done by Abushakra and Reddy on ASHRAE RP 1404, now in progress and scheduled for completion later this year. This is based on previous work by Abushakra for his Ph.D. thesis.
 
Hope this helps.

Hi Rohini, 

 

When you are bill matching there are not magical ways of doing things. You pretty much have to put what's in the building in your model. Those things you can control. The tricky part is to figure out how the building is really being operated and to get the most accurate weather data you can for your site.

 

Cheers,

Hi All, 

While modelling existing building (with calibration to utility bill), do you model every VAV zone or lump similar ones together? What could be possible disadvantages of lumping down the road? Any ECM's that will be affected by this simplification?

Is there a magical way to figure the W/sqft for lighting and plug loads without having to count everything on site? 

Thanks for any insights.

Hey there Joerg,

I had a look through the documentation and couldn't find it.

My guess is that the figures are harmonised with the IGDB which you can 
download for free - in the form of Window 6.0 - from the LBNL website. I 
tried to get an export of the figures but Window 6 is not very export 
friendly so I've attached a screen dump instead.

Cheers

Chris

Hey Joerg,

If you look into the Engineering Reference document that comes up with
EnergyPlus installation, you'll find that under "Window Calculation Module"
title, it says that

The primary Window calculation is a layer-by-layer approach where windows
are considered to be composed of the following components, only the first of
which, glazing, is required to be present:
?
Glazing, which consists of one or more plane/parallel glass layers. If there
are two or more glass layers, the layers are separated by gaps filled with
air or another gas. *The glazing optical and thermal calculations are based
on algorithms from the WINDOW 4 and WINDOW 5 programs* [Arasteh et al.,
1989], [Finlayson et al., 1993]. Glazing layers are described using te input
object WindowMaterial:Glazing.
?
Gap, layers filled with air or another gas that separate glazing layers.
Gaps are described using the input object WindowMaterial:Gas.

Suggest you look into the Engineering Reference document and if you have
further questions regarding "Window 6" software, you can redirect your
questions to *WindowHelp at lbl.gov* .

Hope this helps.

regards,

Chandan

Suwon is quite right - the limitations of system quantities per zone is
a major reason we need air partitions to model actual designs.  There
are a variety of other situations in which a massless partition becomes
useful...

 

In programs like eQuest/DOE2 which are not modeling hourly CFD for air
movement, air surfaces may also be used to approximate/enforce thermal
layering in large volumes such as a gym or an atrium, separating the
"conditioned" volume at the occupied levels from the other layers.  

 

The ability to model air walls in place of a construction with mass also
permits the option to explore limited layout changes such as knocking
down a wall to "thermally connect" two spaces.

 

In summary, "artificial boundaries" can be a pretty useful tool when one
intends to model a variety of things with a higher degree of accuracy.  

 

It appears to me Jeff is making a broader point in the context of the
papers/experiences he is posting, using air walls / approximate zoning
as a specific case-in-point:  Approximating rough partitions/zoning in
an existing building with air walls, even when the exact layout /
thermal massing of the actual partitions is known, can be sufficient,
even necessary, when the intent is to "fit" a model to "real" data.
He's not suggesting thermal construction lag isn't real or important to
model in all cases, but rather that the assumption such behavior is
unaffected by un-modeled/un-measured factors can itself be misleading.

Hi Chris,
 
In most building energy simulation programs including DOE-2, It is
impossible to define two different HVAC systems in one thermal zone.
Therefore, it is sometimes useful to seperate one actural zone into two
thermal zones(e.g. interior zone and perimeter zone) using an
articificial boundary like 'air wall' when an actual one zone in
existinfg building has two different systems, for example, VAV system is
for a interior zone, and fan coil unit is for a perimeter zone.

Sorry Nick, my bad regarding the tangent. What you've described in
eQuest seems synonymous with the NoMass material in Energyplus.

Perhaps I can bring it a little bit back on topic. Jeff mentions the use
of Air walls to model existing buildings. However, if you know where all
the partitions are in an existing building don't they introduce
artificial boundaries?

This thread appears to have tangented into 3+ different directions... if
you have a new inquiry please start a new  email chain =)!

 

Fransisco - you should refine your questions by specifying which program
you intend to use, or if your inquiry is of the "is there a program that
can do this?" variety.  Air walls in eQuest/DOE2 behave as Suwon is
describing.  They are a type of interior partition and will not model
heat transfer to the exterior, regardless of their geometrical location.

 

Chris - I use eQuest/DOE2 primarily.  Please refer to recent discussion
on [eQuest-users] where I attempted to sum up air wall behavior in both
layman's and complex terms (discussion attached).  

 

To my understanding DOE2/eQuest models do not model heat transfer
explicitly by either convection or radiation - all heat movement within
the model is calculated as a series of direct (conductive) transfers
between zone surfaces (interior and exterior) on an hourly basis.  Air
walls are unique type of surface in that they have zero mass but a
relatively low conductivity (by default, approximately the same as a
single layer of 3/8" Gypsum), however this value can be modified as may
be desired.  

 

To Rohini - My existing model calibration experience is probably limited
relative to others contributing - but I can share the general
observation/advice that your models can only ever be as accurate as your
gathered data, or lack thereof.  An important corollary I want to
emphasize is that models ultimately serve a purpose, and that it's
important at the beginning of any project to identify that endgame.
Sometimes it's getting LEED points, sometimes it's advising new or
retrofit design for existing envelopes, HVAC, and/or lighting, sometimes
it's because there's academics who simply want a model they can pick up
after you to tweak to perfection as time goes on... 

 

Defining where the model is headed in terms of intent will permit you to
define a degree/deadband of acceptable accuracy.  Without doing so, you
may lose sanity/sleep to the beast before realizing you don't have a
finish line defined.

Hi,

 

  Is it possible to simulate an open door or a open window in a face
with outdoors boundary conditions? (only calculating heat loss or gains
to the enviroment). Example: If I apply a "infrared transparent' in a
exterior window, does it works as a open window, for energy balance
calculation?

 

Sorry about my english.

 

Thanks,

Francisco Massucci

Hi all,
 
 
In DOE-2 program, "air wall" is a type of interior walls without thermal
mass effect, only for thermal resistance(0.9 hr-ft2-F/btu) between
zones. I think other similar simulation programs have also the same
function.

Hi all,

 

  I would like to add a question to the list:

 

  - Air wall works the same when apllied in a between zones face or in
an outdoor face?

thanks

Dear Jeff,

You mention the use of "Real walls or air walls" between zones in your
post. I feel this raises a question on this list that I've already
enquired on this list. I apologise for raising the issue once more,
however I did not feel that the discussion resulted in a clear
conclusion of how various simulation programs may treat "Air walls" or
"virtual partitions".


I hope you don't mind me asking: 

*	what programs do you use mainly?
*	under normal modelling practice, how would these programs treat
"air walls" with respect to:

	*	 Conduction
	*	Long-wave radiation
	*	Short-wave radiation
	*	Air flow

Many thanks

Chris

Rohini,
 
Zoning a building is still an art form. There are very few papers that
have looked into this with any rigor. 
 
In one thesis we did on the Zachry building, which was the basis for the
Predictor Shootout I and II, we looked at 1, 2, 5 and actual zoning on
the building. What we saw was that, in general, the centroid of the
"cloud" of data points remained about the same. However, the scatter in
the cloud became more  pronounced at we added more zones.
 
So, if all the zones in the floor are being operated the same, I'd use
1, 2 or 5 zones per floor, depending on the functions of what's going on
in each zone. Real walls or air walls between the zones usually get the
job done.
 
The quickest way to get the light and receptacle loads on a real
building is using "blink" tests, which can be done on a Saturday, with
walkie talkies, and a data logger on the whole-building electric feed,
possibly some sub feeds. I first heard of this test from Todd Taylor at
PNNL. We've used it to help resolved motor loads, lighting loads,
receptacles, etc. Seems to work pretty well. 
 
There are also several ways to get the plug loads, including: by proxy,
by weather-day-type profiles, by daily readings, and a method that uses
an energy balance. The proxy methods can use square proxies for for the
occupancy based on OLF/ELF ratios, the weather-day-type method was
something that I heard about from Don Hadley at PNNL, later adopted by
Bou Saada on the Forrestal building and daycare center. The daily
readings are just that, read the main meter by eye, daily, especially
during weather independent times. The energy balance method is
documented in papers by Claridge et al. at the ESL.
 
There is also some encouraging work being done by Abushakra and Reddy on
ASHRAE RP 1404, now in progress and scheduled for completion later this
year. This is based on previous work by Abushakra for his Ph.D. thesis.
 
Hope this helps.
 
Jeff

Hi Rohini, 

 

When you are bill matching there are not magical ways of doing things.
You pretty much have to put what's in the building in your model. Those
things you can control. The tricky part is to figure out how the
building is really being operated and to get the most accurate weather
data you can for your site.

 

Cheers,

 

Carol

Hi All, 

While modelling existing building (with calibration to utility bill), do
you model every VAV zone or lump similar ones together? What could be
possible disadvantages of lumping down the road? Any ECM's that will be

Is there a magical way to figure the W/sqft for lighting and plug loads
without having to count everything on site? 

Thanks for any insights.

Thanks a lot guys and once again sorry to Jeff for taking it OT.

It seems that air walls mean different things in different simulation 
environments. It's been really helpful understanding what modellers from 
the DOE2 pedigree use. My principle experience with these "Air walls" 
has been within the micro-tradition of IES. Amongst IES users the trend 
seems to be to model air walls as holes, transparent to solar beam, 
acting as a "diffusing layer" to longwave radiation (but with Emissivity 
= 1). IES can also model bulk air flow between one zone and the next 
using macroflo.

This method has its uses, but can also be abused somewhat by users 
trying to do "CFD"!

You've been very helpful, thanks

Chris

Message-ID: <fb13b276b5cb.4d5282a4@iit.edu>

I have brought up this subject before and the advice was 32-programs should work with 64-bit computers using Windows 7.  I have just replaced Vista with Windows 7 Professional.  I still cannot run the DOE2.1E program and the weather processors (PKAFT, MKAFT, STAT, etc.)  besides the APEC-HCCV.  I get the message that a 32-bit program will not run 64-bit computer.  I have a lot of files of buildings analyzed with DOE2.1E
Are the any instructions for making the adjustment?

Try right-clicking on the desktop icon for the program you want to run and
change the compatibility mode to Windows XP:
 

 
If that doesn't work install Microsoft's Virtual PC and XP Mode
(http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/) .  Install those older
programs within that environment and they should work fine.

Matt,

We can supply you with a new TM2 file for your site, if that will help get 
you unstuck.  Our new system builds them from the most recent 30 years of 
hourly data pretty much right at your site of interest and they come in both 
TM2 and EPW format (soon .BIN as well for DOE-2).  While we are a commercial 
service, I will get you this file at no charge if it helps you...perhaps you 
will become a customer in the future.

Let me know.

Chuck

I'm surprised that you're experiencing difficulties with TMY2 data,
since they've been around for 15 years. Which weather file were you using?
The only time I've ever experienced with DOE-2 stopping due to a weather
file was when the file had bad psychrometrics that were outside of
physical possibility.

?Hello Varkie,

This is a common problem for people using 64-bit Windows 7.  I have that version and have had numerous 32-bit programs that won't run on my 64-bit computer (though some do run.)  The only sure way I know of is to run these under the Windows XP mode.  If you haven't installed that capability, it's available at: http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/download.aspx

Varkie,

I'm surprised that you're having trouble running 2.1E and the DOE-2 
weather processor using Windows 7.  I switched to a PC running 64-bit 
Windows 7, and haven't had any difficulties running any of the DOE-2 
programs, although I have encountered difficulties with some old Unix 
utilities and the Microsoft Developer Studio GUI for Fortran (although 
the Fortran compiler itself runs fine).  From the program
names you list, you're probably running a different compilation of 2.1E 
than mine, which was done using Compaq Visual Fortran (ex-Digital 
Fortran, etc.).

I'm more interested in finding out why that weather file and/or 
combination with the building file can cause DOE-2 to hang.  If the 
issue is just a faulty weather file, there are several alternatives for 
New York NY - TMY, WYEC2, or TMY3. In fact, the TMY3 for New York in 
*.bin format has been on my website 
(http://www.whiteboxtechnologies.com/downloads/TMY3/NJ_NY_PA_TMY3.zip) 
for over two years.

Hi Sambhav,

For natural ventilation analysis, you may start with some field measurements
or wind tunnel test  which can help you decide the boundary condition
precisely. Some key parameters, such as prevailing wind direction,
representative wind speed, air temperatures, surface temperatures, etc. are
all important components of the boundary condition. Meanwhile, building
geometry, building materials, surrounding buildings, topography, etc.
may influence the boundary condition significantly. You will have a holistic
consideration of all these variables and make reasonable simplification to
work out the boundary condition.

Regards,

Cheney

Sambhav

You should carry out a dynamic thermal model first to will allow you to
establish far more accurately (than just guessing) what the boundary
conditions for the specific time you are looking at are.

Shambav,

It would be helpful to know more about what you want to achieve with 
natural ventilation. In order of precedence:

   1. How temperate is the climate? The climate needs to be fairly
      temperate. Most of the UK will be ok for natural vent in many
      commercial buildings. The same is not true for the South of France!
   2. How heavily used is the building? Forget natural ventilation if a
      building has dense occupancy or high IT loads.
   3. If rules of thumb are followed (e.g. 5% of floor area reflected as
      openable area, thermal mass, floor depth to ceiling height ratio,
      glazing!) this is a good starting point for the design
   4. A zonal (not CFD) model will allow you to assess the performance
      of the design against weather data and standards such as ASHRAE
      55. Zonal models are computationally cheaper than CFD and will
      help consider strategies such as night time purge ventilation and
      optimisation of thermal mass.
   5. Finally, if you're doing something really unusual or bespoke (like
      working for Norman Foster) CFD may be warranted. Boundary
      conditions such as surface temperatures and flow through openings
      can be extracted from a "snapshot" of the zonal modelling. You may
      want to choose more than one design day to cover variations in
      climate and use (e.g. still days when there is little wind to
      drive ventilation).

Regards

Chris

Hi everyone

The Energy plus documentation specifies that for typical commercial
buildings in the USA, a reasonable default value for ground temperature:
building surface is 2 degC less than the average indoor space temperature.
What could be a probable default ground temperature for Indian climates, say
New Delhi or Jaipur?

Shaun,
I could not do this because the DOE2.1E program does not have a desktop icon.  See message attached.  Thanks for the information because it worked on a 32-bit program with a desktop icon that I transfered from another computer.

Hi,

  You may use the last month mean temperature, less 1 degree. It's a
simplify method but I've seen many simulations this way.

Hi,

 

I'd appreciate if someone can instruct me the steps of modeling an overhang
that extends above the main entrance of a building. It exceeds the entrance
door width and independent on windows location.

Hi Shambav,

Both Eric and Chris offered very good points. I'd like to remind you that no
matter how your get the boundary condition, it must be reasonable. I know
some simulation programs can generate boundary condition through
dynamic thermal calculation or bulk air model, such IES VE or TAS. However,
you'd better verify the boundary condition based on your common sense and
experience. I did some natural ventilation related study before and
noticed the results from CFD simulation could be logical only when the
boundary condition is well established. That's why I highly recommend field
measurements or wind tunnel test as a starting point. What's the difference
between them and those dynamic calculation results:

1. Natural ventilation is quite micro-climate oriented. Surrounding
buildings, topography, landscape, etc will have very significant impact on
it. However, most dynamic calculation will use a standard weather file
generated from nearby airport or open sapce. As a result, a misleading
boundary condition could be generated.

2. Some variables, such as surface temperatures, may vary a lot between real
world and computational one. Most time I have a feeling that simplified
thermal engine could not trace the complicity of the real world perfectly
and underestimate the surface temperatures. I did mention it in one of my
recent post.

Regards,

Cheney

Don't the TMY2 & EPW weather data files have ground temperature in them?

 

http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/cfm/weather_data3.cfm/re
gion=2_asia_wmo_region_2/country=IND/cname=India

 

You can convert the epw files to CSV so that you can take a look at them
with the energy plus weather utility, if I remember correctly.

Hi everyone

 

The Energy plus documentation specifies that for typical commercial
buildings in the USA, a reasonable default value for ground temperature:
building surface is 2 degC less than the average indoor space temperature.

What could be a probable default ground temperature for Indian climates,
say New Delhi or Jaipur?

 

Thanks

Hi Arpan,

IES VE's macroflo module may be useful here. If you go to Macroflo/Macroflo
opening types/Exposure types, you may find that there are couple of
scenarios pre-defined. They are sort of simplified way to estimate the
impact from surrounding buildings. Other than that, I doubt IES VE thermal
calculation modules can trace the real 3D model and generate very accurate
wind flow pattern accordingly. You know what, sometimes, when field
measurements or wind tunnel test are not possible, we will run CFD twice.
The first simulation will focus on the external CFD analysis with respect
to the designed building and its surroundings (include adjacent buildings).
The results from the first one will be a good reference for the second round
of internal CFD analysis.

Regards,

Cheney

Hello

I would just like to know if it will be acceptable to use ASHRAE 90.1, 2010
standard for LEED 2009 projects.

I ask this because, the system selection for storages,toilets,etc. are
treated differently in the 2010 standard than in the previous ones.

It would be great to know if LEED would accept the use of 2010 standard.

Thank you.

My general understanding is that 90.1-2007 and 2010 are two VERY
different animals.    I'd be very concerned with EAp2 / EAp1 becoming
very difficult to document as they're structured around 90.1-2007.

 

Here's a question to those more familiar with 2010 that may help Vinay: 

 

Is a "90.1-2010-compliant" design guaranteed to be
"90.1-2007-compliant," in a prescriptive context?

Yes, the weather file does have ground temperatures but its given for
different no. of ground temperature depths and is not clear. Further the
weatehr file ground temperatures are undisturbed ground temperatures, and as
per the EnergyPlus documentation, its not appropriate to take these values
for simulation

You can get EnergyPlus help at the helpdesk: http://energyplus.helpserve.com

the slab utility use is described in the Auxiliary Programs document 
and you can also embed objects into your IDF and have the slab 
program run automatically.

John - 

I took classes provided by the U Wisc Dept of Engr Prof Development.
 - one on energy modeling - http://epdweb.engr.wisc.edu/Courses/Course_Date_To_Be_Announced.lasso?myCourseChoice=L499
 - one on geothermal systems design - http://epdweb.engr.wisc.edu/Courses/Course.lasso?myCourseChoice=L901

I can highly recommend both classes - the content was immediately applicable to my practice, the professors were clearly experts, the materials and handouts have proven to be valuable references over the years.

anybody know of any?

I am finding that energy modeling and geo thermal systems have the same

can't get my questions answered, it is the fact I don't even know what

Chris. 

I'm a little old fashion. I mainly have used DOE2.1e for 25+ years and taught it for 20+ years. Recently, I've begun to use and teach EQUEST and am familiar with TRNSYS, BLAST  and EnergyPlus, and have use other very old programs like SERIRES, PASOLE, DEROB, FCHART, PVFCHART, some home-rolled FD programs, and others I've forgotten. 

When I teach students about interior walls I always preface the discussion with the question: what is the wall doing? Is it separating two zones at the same temperature? Is there daylighting? Direct gsain?...if not, then it probably contributes little to the heat transfer. 

The exception to this is if it is thermally massive, then it may be acting to dampen loads if the "connection" is strong, I.e., if the combined convection/radiation coefficient has a small resistance and large area (Manke and Hittle talked about this in their paper, and Janet covered it more in her thesis). 

So, if the wall is separating two zones with different temperatures then it plays a stronger role in the zone heat transfer. 

Most programs combine convection and radiation heat transfer into one coefficient. Some have bouyancy in this coefficient, most don't. 

Use of interior walls is more important for simulations considering daylighting, so care needs to be taken to get the surface characteristics and orientation right. 
An airwall itself is just a massless resister between two space temperature nodes, often which is determined, ad hoc, by the user. 

There are cases where interior walls count in thermal simulation, such as passive solar, direct gain, etc. However, the physics of the real passive solar room is probably not well represented by such a simplistic representation in DOE-2, and would be better served by a special purpose program. 

So, a long story short is that I would consider interior walls as a second order effect for buildings with zones all at the same temperature. So simple is better. This allows you to spend your time on the windows, systems, orientation, shading and other things that are first order parameters. 

Hope this helps.

Dear Jeff,



You mention the use of "Real walls or air walls" between zones in your post. I feel this raises a question on this list that I've already enquired on this list. I apologise for raising the issue once more, however I did not feel that the discussion resulted in a clear conclusion of how various simulation programs may treat "Air walls" or "virtual partitions".



I hope you don't mind me asking: 


*	what programs do you use mainly?
*	under normal modelling practice, how would these programs treat "air walls" with respect to:

	*	 Conduction
	*	Long-wave radiation
	*	Short-wave radiation
	*	Air flow

Many thanks

Chris

	Rohini,

	 

	Zoning a building is still an art form. There are very few papers that have looked into this with any rigor. 

	 

	In one thesis we did on the Zachry building, which was the basis for the Predictor Shootout I and II, we looked at 1, 2, 5 and actual zoning on the building. What we saw was that, in general, the centroid of the "cloud" of data points remained about the same. However, the scatter in the cloud became more  pronounced at we added more zones.

	 

	So, if all the zones in the floor are being operated the same, I'd use 1, 2 or 5 zones per floor, depending on the functions of what's going on in each zone. Real walls or air walls between the zones usually get the job done.

	 

	The quickest way to get the light and receptacle loads on a real building is using "blink" tests, which can be done on a Saturday, with walkie talkies, and a data logger on the whole-building electric feed, possibly some sub feeds. I first heard of this test from Todd Taylor at PNNL. We've used it to help resolved motor loads, lighting loads, receptacles, etc. Seems to work pretty well. 

	 

	There are also several ways to get the plug loads, including: by proxy, by weather-day-type profiles, by daily readings, and a method that uses an energy balance. The proxy methods can use square proxies for for the occupancy based on OLF/ELF ratios, the weather-day-type method was something that I heard about from Don Hadley at PNNL, later adopted by Bou Saada on the Forrestal building and daycare center. The daily readings are just that, read the main meter by eye, daily, especially during weather independent times. The energy balance method is documented in papers by Claridge et al. at the ESL.

	 

	There is also some encouraging work being done by Abushakra and Reddy on ASHRAE RP 1404, now in progress and scheduled for completion later this year. This is based on previous work by Abushakra for his Ph.D. thesis.

	 

	Hope this helps.

	Hi Rohini, 

	When you are bill matching there are not magical ways of doing things. You pretty much have to put what's in the building in your model. Those things you can control. The tricky part is to figure out how the building is really being operated and to get the most accurate weather data you can for your site.
	
	
	Cheers,

FYI. 

Dr Atch Sreshthaputra did a good job with this for a Buddist temple in Thailand, which was published in Energy and Buildings. He combined CFD with DOE-2 and got some very interesting results. Problem is that it took 24 hrs to simulate 24 hrs on a fast PC. So he limited his analysis to a few days each year.

	calculations?
Message-ID: <4D567293.3060500@gmail.com>

Dear All

Within the past year I've experienced at least two consultants who have 
mandated /calculations /of Supply/ Space conditioning air rates in a way 
that effectively ignores thermal mass and treats all loads (including 
peak solar gain) as undiversified (i.e. permenantly on).

One of the consultants has presented this as a basis for 8760 hour 
energy models for a extensive range of building types. Fans are required 
to operate at the /calculated /rate for all periods of HVAC operation. I 
feel this could grossly over estimate fan power in all but a few 
circumstances.

Does anybody here model like this?

Best regards

Hi James,
In my experience most CAV systems only supply outdoor air, but these 
calcs are to be applied to all conditioning air flowrates. So whether 
it's VAV (which is fairly uncommon in the UK) or Four Pipe Fan Coil 
systems they all need to use this method.
Thanks for your comments

I cannot make the DOE21E  run on a 64-bit computer?  I have tried all the suggestions sent to me.  
How would you convert NCDC weather data to .bin files for use with eQUEST? The weather processors (PKAFT, STAT, MKAFT) do not come with eQUEST.  
Does VisualDOE, EnergyPro, etc., run on 64-bit?  If they don't, will USDOE pay compensation to all those who invested in interfaces to DOE21E?  
Is there statistical usage data on the programs being used for energy code compliance and LEED certification in the US?  Which one is used the most?

Hello everyone,

I searched through the equest archives and couldn't find a solution (someone
else had this problem but no one offered a solution).

Anyways, my problem is that while using the EEM Wizard my EEM changes are
not saved (I'm trying a basic Glazing EEM-changing the U-value/SHGC). After
I make the change and hit done, I then go back into the EEM and it has
reverted back to the original values. Does anyone have a solution or ran
into this problem before??

Thanks,

Hi Ben,

You may be better off emailing the eQUEST list-serv (you need to sign up for it similarly to how you signed up for Building-Sim List). I have had some problems with weird EEM Wizard behavior - my solution was to manually edit the .pd2 file in wordpad. When you open the file, scroll down to the bottom - you should see where it describes your EEM measures. You can then make changes to the file (you should see the structure with the existing EEM measures - just be sure to follow that).

Another solution is to change to the Detailed Edit mode and make parametric runs - I've had less problems with them.

Good luck,
Alex

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Equest EEM Error

Hello everyone,

I searched through the equest archives and couldn't find a solution (someone else had this problem but no one offered a solution).

Anyways, my problem is that while using the EEM Wizard my EEM changes are not saved (I'm trying a basic Glazing EEM-changing the U-value/SHGC). After I make the change and hit done, I then go back into the EEM and it has reverted back to the original values. Does anyone have a solution or ran into this problem before??

Thanks,

Ben Jordan

It would seem you are still trying to run it from the windows 7 run/cmd.   
 
The only way to get it to Doe21e to work is to run it from virtual PC  --->
go here www.microsoft.com/windows/
<http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/> virtual-pc/  and install the
virtual PC and XP mode programs
 
I know this works because DOE21e is used in the EE4 program here in Canada.
As you can see here, the program loaded and ran, but returned an IO-21 error
because I didn't give it an input file to run -

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Energy consumption difference in E+ and Equest
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=RbRm7SfhSBVd7OQus3Q5xZc+BZumitnW3VT2D@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

We are trying to compare cooling energy consumption of a typical office
building model in EnergyPlus and eQUEST. Simulation model is a simple 5 zone
model with PTAC system. Climate is New Delhi. Heating consumption is near
zero in both the models. We tried our best to closely match models in these
two software. The result says, cooling electricity consumption/sq.m./year is
about- 35 KW/sq.m./year (in Energyplus) and 100 KW/sq.m./year (in Equest).
Some of the guidelines says that cooling consumption should be around
100-120KW/sq.m./year. Is this correct? Does any one has come across this
phenomenon.

Why EnergyPlus is giving very less consumption as compared to Equest or
references?

Thanks & regards,
Vaibhav Jain

Vaibhav

Sorry to nit pick... don't you mean kWh/sq.m/year?

It's difficult to say what you're discrepancy comes from without having 
the models.
All I can recommend is reviewing both model's results at successively 
deeper levels detail. You've already covered the first level of detail - 
the cooling consumption doesn't match.
Your next courses of action may be:

   1. Review monthly consumption
   2. I haven't used equest but assume you can review *hourly *air temps
      and loads, so compare these next.
   3. Solar gain

Are your figures based on zone demand or plant? You've got quite a few 
layers to compare.

Cheers

Chris

If you haven't done this already, I would suggest comparing the other annual end-uses for the models as well.

If cooling is the only one varying then you have some questions about specific inputs.  (equip efficiency, infiltration, etc.)

However, if all of the end-uses are varying between the two models then you'll have a wider group of inputs to consider. (internal gains, occupancy, envelope construction, etc., plus those above.)

Not sure how much this would be of help but the following link provides 
comparison of EnergyPlus results with analytical results and also 
comparison with the results of other simulation tools.

http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/energyplus_testing.cfm

Don't know much about it but it may give you some idea about what the 
energy simulation results are with different simulation engines and also 
as compare to analytical results.

Regards,

Chandan

Dear all

I am comparing the epuipment sizing of a day time and a 24 hr office
building on EnergyPlus. When I simulate the two while autosizing the hvac
equipment, the Nominal Cooling Capacity (W) of the 24 hr building comes less
than the day time building. Though the total energy consumption, as
expected, of the 24 hr building is more than the 12 hr building, why
the cooling capacity (equipment size) of the 24 hr building is lower than
the 12 hr building. In my particular case, for a conditioned area of around
1600 m2, the cooling capacity for day time and 24 hr building is coming
around 146 kW and 128 kW, respectively.
What could be the possible reasons for such behaviour?

Thanks

My best guess would be the pull-down cooling load.  If you're modeling the 12-hr building as 12 hours occupied and 12 hours unoccupied.  The software may let the building temperature float way up outside of setpoint during the unoccupied hours.  Then, when your occupied hours start, the equipment needs extra capacity to pull down the thermal lag of the building to meet setpoint in a reasonable timeframe.  Make sense?  Are you modeling it that way?

yes the thermal mass of the building may lead to this sort of behavior, but
is it a general phenomenon? Further to my previous mail, there is no night
setback in my model and I am taking the same building for both the cases by
just changing the schedules accordingly

Chris,



There many layers of differences between the two codes. However, there are some ways they can be compared, this is what Standard 140 from ASHRAE has been doing for the last 20 years (i.e., Ron Judkopf and Joel Neymark at NREL). Basically, there are envelope tests, ground couping tests, systems tests, etc. Unfortunately, when all combined they can produce unpleasant differences that are hard to explain to clients. All differences, for the most part, have been cited in the previous literature, if you know where to look.



We are currently developing a test of Equest, DOE-2.1e and EnergyPlus, as well as BIM files for three platforms as part of the RP1468 project we are working on. This may help to shed some light on a few issues...bottom line, the differences are complex, but, in general, traceable to differences in specific algorithms in the three models. I might also add that one should consider several other programs when looking at differences, for example, ESPr, TRACE, HAP and TRNSYS...probably enough work to keep someone busy for years tracing the differences.



Think of it like chosing a new car...all cars will deliver you from point A to point B, but different cars have different technologies to do that, diesel, gasoline, hybrid, and come in all shapes and sizes...cars, trucks, vans, etc.

If you haven't done this already, I would suggest comparing the other annual end-uses for the models as well.

If cooling is the only one varying then you have some questions about specific inputs.  (equip efficiency, infiltration, etc.)

However, if all of the end-uses are varying between the two models then you'll have a wider group of inputs to consider. (internal gains, occupancy, envelope construction, etc., plus those above.)

Sorry to nit pick... don't you mean kWh/sq.m/year?

It's difficult to say what you're discrepancy comes from without having the models.
All I can recommend is reviewing both model's results at successively deeper levels detail. You've already covered the first level of detail - the cooling consumption doesn't match.
Your next courses of action may be:

  1.  Review monthly consumption
  2.  I haven't used equest but assume you can review hourly air temps and loads, so compare these next.
  3.  Solar gain

Are your figures based on zone demand or plant? You've got quite a few layers to compare.

Cheers

Hello,

We are trying to compare cooling energy consumption of a typical office building model in EnergyPlus and eQUEST. Simulation model is a simple 5 zone model with PTAC system. Climate is New Delhi. Heating consumption is near zero in both the models. We tried our best to closely match models in these two software. The result says, cooling electricity consumption/sq.m./year is about- 35 KW/sq.m./year (in Energyplus) and 100 KW/sq.m./year (in Equest). Some of the guidelines says that cooling consumption should be around 100-120KW/sq.m./year. Is this correct? Does any one has come across this phenomenon.

Why EnergyPlus is giving very less consumption as compared to Equest or references?

Thanks & regards,

Hi Fareed,

 

You can set up block charges as described and other custom rates most
easily in the SD/DD wizards.  

 

If you're past the wizards and in detailed mode, I'd start a new file to
create the rates and assign them unique names, isolate the generated
rate lines in the .inp, then import the trimmed .inp into the target
project.  You could alternatively copy/paste the appropriate lines
manually into the target project's .inp.

 

Select '-custom-' gas and electric rates from that pulldown at the
General Information screen (first screen under Project / Site / Utility
button in DD wizard), then the appropriate screens will be available for
input.

Dear colleagues and friends in the Greater Boston Area,

 

As recently announced to this list, we will be launching an IBPSA-USA
chapter for the greater Boston area next Tuesday, February 22nd, from
8:00 AM to 9:30 AM, at the Harvard Design School which is located at 48
Quincy Street in Cambridge.  We will be in Gund Hall Room 112, right
next to the cafeteria. We have a panel of speakers from IBPSA USA as
well as local practitioners and scholars who will provide short
overviews of the current state of building performance simulation within
their area of expertise as well as their vision of where BPS should be
heading and what role the local chapter of IBPSA USA could play to
facilitate this process. In the future we intend to organize quarterly
morning meetings during which speaker pairs from industry and academia
will share their results and activities related to BPS. We need your
input and I hope that hope many of you in the Boston area will find the
time to join us next Tuesday. We also have a number of board openings to
fill!

 

Autodesk is very kindly providing coffee and pastries for the event
which we will have to order by tomorrow at noon. So, please make time,
join us and RVSP now at www.ibpsa-boston.com

Message-ID: <AANLkTim6=7Gc6qqpP-Nx8ZSu0Gu_FSSPHNg0Ov1zoVE3@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,
         In my project i have high speed disel fired boiler for
service hot water requirement how can i model it because in boiler
source there is no source  as disel.

And if the design is such that the hot water set point is 60C and it
if preated through solar collector and if achived 60C the disel boiler
wont operate and if not able to achive 60C  due to weather conditions
say till 50C then only disel boiler will operate to heat through
additional 10F then in such case how can we claim savings of hot water
in proposed case because solar heater is reducing the hours of
operation of disel boiler how can we quantify those hours.

I look forward for your valuable response.

Thanks

Here are the instructions for running 32-bit programs in the XP-Mode on computers with 64-bit Windows 7 (versions Professional, Enterprise & Ultimate only)
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/help/videos/using-windows-xp-mode
 
DOE21E was the only program that gave me a problem.
 
There seems to be no future to any of the DOE2 based programs including the weather processors (cannot convert NCDC weather files to location.bin).  Almost all architects & engineers working on real buildings have switched from DOE21E to eQUEST, TRACE, HAP, etc. ? Not EnergyPlus  The development of DOE21E and EnergyPlus was/is done with tax dollars.  
 
Programs like DOE21E are still valid for over 90% of building projects. The APEC HCC-V program was written in 1966 (a forms input interface was added 20 years ago) is still a very practical & useful program.    http://bepan.info/hvac-prog/x1-apec-hccv-loads
 
My suggestions for expanding and improving DOE21E are expressed in Article 3 ?Building Design and Energy Analysis Programs?.  Please also read ?Accuracy Requirement of Energy Analysis Programs? also in Article 3.    http://bepan.info/articles
 
If the DOE21E program and the source code are made open source, then graduate research students could try out new ideas.  Actually you don?t need the source code. Instead freeze the existing code since it is error-free and make it possible to add/attach independent programs to it.  
 
The intermediate results between Loads, Systems, Plant & Economics modules are saved in intermediate temporary files for use by the next module.  Hourly results of all the FORTRAN variables from each module are available for print out by the program.  The BDL input data is read into FORTRAN variables and so also are the output report variables.  All this data could be organized, formatted and saved in an Excel type files that can read by other programs. Go to http://
 
I have transferred the hourly FORTRAN variable output from DOE21E to Excel for further analysis of specific projects.  
Example: condensate from systems cooling coils for a building in Dubai to be used for irrigation.  13 ? Project ? Condensate-Water Recovery.   http://bepan.info/engg-calcs 
Example: The photo-voltaic (PV panels) performance for the Chicago Center for Green Technology was also obtained from DOE21E hourly variables and applying the manufacturers claim of percent converted 110V electricity.   http://bepan.info/proj-bldgs/p11-ccgt-doe21e
 
Direct use of the BDL with constant reference to the manuals, is still important for learning and understanding the program.  I have created templates of BDL for different systems, plant, load-management, utilities, etc. enable students to learn the direct use of DOE21E quickly.  They would later switch to the interface (this would be eQUEST if nothing else is available) when turning out building projects.  
 
I also have numerous DOE21E .inp files of several types of buildings that can be modified and simplified into case studies for teaching and learning.

I have brought up this subject before and the advice was 32-programs should work with 64-bit computers using Windows 7.  I have just replaced Vista with Windows 7 Professional.  I still cannot run the DOE2.1E program and the weather processors (PKAFT, MKAFT, STAT, etc.)  besides the APEC-HCCV.  I get the message that a 32-bit program will not run 64-bit computer.  I have a lot of files of buildings analyzed with DOE2.1E
Are the any instructions for making the adjustment?

There are a few other details needed by proficient simulationistas.

Microsoft Excel 2007 massively increased the allowed size of 
Spreadsheets, compared to earlier versions.

The software needed to run Windows 7 Pro / ULT / usw. in the virtual XP 
PRo mode is not on the OEM install disk.
It has to be downloaded and installed. Go to the Virtual PC Homepage URL

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Savings calculations for CI project
Message-ID: <937853.20364.qm@web95908.mail.in.yahoo.com>

Hello,

Our client is occupying the 8th floor of a G+8 building. The central 
plant is a combination of Air cooled and water cooled chillers. The 
conditioned area of the project area alone is 45,000 sqft and segment 
area is 322,000 sqft. I simulated using the project area-segment area 
method. I used the existing conditions for segment area in both base 
case and proposed case. I modeled the project area as per ASHRAE 90.1 
2007. Now the problem is with the savings calculation. As per LEED, the 
formula is (Base case-Proposed Case)/(Base case*(project area/segment 
area)). Since the project is occupying only 1 floor, the project area/ 
segment area ratio comes up to 0.139 and because of this the savings 
goes higher than 100%. In other words, we will be multiplying the 
savings by 7 times, if we calculate the savings by the usual formula, 
(Base case- Proposed case)/base case. Kindly guide how to proceed. Thank
 you.

Regards,
Rathnashree

Hi All,
          Computational fluid dynamics a very powerful concept of
optimizing air flow and predicting thermal comfort of a building in
terms of temperature, air circulation, contaminants etc however
applying a correct boundary condition is a time consuming work  as the
boundary conditions varies our results varies over a range recently i
seen a cfd online query where one user has used velocity as inlet
condition and pressure as a outlet condition for naturally ventilation
a room with heat  a generating source inside room how far is  this
condition justified.

Thanks

The help file (press F1 on any screen in TRACE) and User's Manual are pretty helpful with how to model geothermal heat pumps, I would suggest reading through those first. In terms of modeling the appropriate ground loop temperatures and associated WWHP efficiency, there are a couple of ways of doing it (see help file and User's manual for specifics). Just keep in mind that when you create a new WWHP in the Cooling Equipment library and define the Full Load Energy Rate and the Design Entering Condenser Water Temperature, you need to base them on the worst case entering loop temperatures over the year. TRACE assumes you enter the efficiency at the hottest and coldest entering condenser temperatures for Cooling and Heating efficiency respectively and then uses the Power Consumed and Ambient Modification Unloading Curves to adjust the efficiency for air-side load and change in entering loop temperature.

In eQUEST:

I'm a little rusty on eQUEST, but this is how I remember it. You can enter the ground and well properties for your site and system which will be the basis of entering loop temperature for the equipment as a function of the load on the equipment over the year. eQUEST wants the equipment efficiency at ARI conditions and then you enter the unloading curves (see help/Documentation for more info on this). The concept here is similar to TRACE but from what I remember it is more detailed.

We are designing a lot of geo-thermal heat-pumps. If we can't model the benefit of the well-field accurately, we can't model the energy use.

I can probably fill in a little on the eQuest side of the coin:

 

My general understanding is that you should be able to use either Trace
or eQuest to model process efficiency which varies with the ground loop
temperature.

 

I approached this once in eQuest, and based on that experience and as I
think others have brought up, you're restricted to using a CW loop of
the lake/well type, which means you must define for the program what the
temperature behavior of the GLHX is over the year (as a schedule). 

 

Once the groundwater temps are dealt with, from there you can either use
the default loop-to-loop chiller curves in the eQuest library, or define
your own.  The three curves separately define the following:

1.       Effects of part load on the EIR  (EIR-fPLR)

2.       Effects of temperatures on the capacity  (CAP-fT)

3.       Effects of temperatures on the EIR  (EIR-fT)

 

Unlike centrifugal chillers, finding the manufacturers data necessary to
make your own custom curves in DOE2/eQuest is not a trial by fire - all
the data for the above curves may be found on a single spec sheet
without conversions, depending on who your WWHP manf is...  There are
some restrictions regarding pump quantities and behavior of the
"loop-to-loop chiller" system  - I'd advise you to carefully review the
DOE2 dictionary entry and diagrams for "Loop-to-Loop Heat-Pump" to get
an sense of how the equipment behaves and how you may need to react
accordingly to match your proposed design.

 

I'd also refer you to not miss a recent writeup/report posted to
eQuest-users by Dana Troy detailing a strategy/feasibility study to
approach multi-stack heatpumps in eQuest... something I could've used in
the afore-mentioned project.

 

Best of luck!

John,

eQuest can model a geoexchange field but there are a lot of limitations. There is an upper limit on field size and there are limitations on the plant side as well. You can use a single zone heat pump configuration or try to setup a loop-to-loop heat pump, but that can get nasty. 

To do an accurate model of a geoexchange system you'd probably be best off using TRNSYS and/or a manufacturer's software. TRNSYS has a steep learning curve and the manufacturer's software can be a bit of a black box with hidden factors of safety, etc. Also TRNSYS can only do cylindrical fields, which can be a significant limitation in some instances.

I've never tried a geoexchange model in Trace.

Getting an accurate heat pump performance curve can be challenging. To make a good performance map in TRNSYS takes about 50 selections at varying inlet temperatures on both evaporator and condenser sides. Then there is a whole other ball of wax called controls. 

What we typically do is model the building and get hourly loads in eQuest. And then transfer the loads to TRNSYS to be modeled there with a field sized using manufacturer software. It's unfortunately a bit of a convoluted process to right size a field, but it is worth it as design costs are much less than construction costs for large fields. 

If you have a small field you probably could get away with getting loads out of Trace or eQuest and placing it in the manufacturer's software. 

Sorry for the long convoluted answer. 

Good luck!

hello; 
I am trying to simulate a walk in cooler in eQuest, but the zone entering supply air temperature under coil capacity/control, cooling control and reset is not allowing me to enter value below 55F. I need to set it up to 25 F. is there a way to overcome this problem. 
thank you for your help

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Revising Policy Related to Help Wanted Ads and Services
	Offered
Message-ID: <4D65836D.4060609@gard.com>

Lately, it seems like we are getting many help wanted and 
services offered postings to the BLDG-SIM and other mailing 
lists on onebuilding.org.  It has become common enough that 
I am wondering if it is time to revisit the policy on those 
kinds of messages.

Remember the core purpose of the mailing lists is to help 
each other with the use of building energy simulation 
programs and I don't want that messed up by becoming just a 
job board. On the other hand, helping people in the 
community get jobs and find help seems like a good idea too.

The current policy is shown on

http://onebuilding.org/guidelines.html

and states:

"Job announcements are welcome on the mailing lists but are 
restricted to one posting per month on your choice of one 
onebuilding.org mailing list."

It seems like we have a number of choices and I would like 
your input on revising the policy. Here are some choices 
that I thought up:

a) Keep as is.

b) Add "service offered" to the policy.

c) Require that all job announcements and services offered 
are posted on one certain day per month (a job fair day).

d) Create a new mailing list called SIM-JOBS that would be 
the only location that these kind of posts would be allowed.

e) Do not allow any help wanted or services offered posting 
at all.

If you have an opinion or you have other ideas, please 
respond to the BLDG-SIM mailing list and let us know.

Hopefully this will spur enough discussion that I will get 
an understanding of how the people using the mailing list feel.

Thanks

Jason

Caveats: NONE

I know about the water run-around loop, is there a run-around loop that uses
a heat pump system?

It would have a refrigerant coil in the exhaust air stream and a refrigerant
coil in the outside air stream.  I would think this would allow the outside
air to be conditioned to a temperature above (or below) the exhaust air.

I don't know if it would be practical, but I can't find anybody who makes
anything on the web.

Dear Jason,

I think it is not wrong to post jobs, when related to the building
simulation topic in general. Posting them on a specific day of the month, is
an almost impossible limitation for those announcing the job.

It would be helpfull, though, to have a statement in the mail subject that
indicates it is a job announcement, with maybe a differentiation for
academic jobs and others. Something as simple as 'JOB' could do the job ;-)

Maybe require that it be clear in the message subject that the post

third tag)...then those of us who are inclined can filter, those who are

I post an open position in an effort to help anyone out there that is
currently looking. I think that a subject line like the one on this email
would be sufficient to differentiate job postings from help/advise postings.
I know that there are a lot of messages going around everyday to answer
questions and to give advice and that's what it's all about. Industry
listserv is an efficient way to reach qualified people that are either just
looking or that are in need of a job and are having a hard time locating
one. It is not meant to take away from the primary purpose of the listserv.

As one that offers a service to this community (weather data) and one who 
expects to have job openings soon, I also like the idea of a tags like 
"Services Offered" and "Job Posting" in the subject line, as suggested by 
David.

Dear Group,
                 as a new user of this mailing list and
a developing professional in building energy modelling,
I'm extremely pleased mailing lists like this exists at all. The fact that
is not used just for support but also for posting Job offerings
and Training courses,  in my particular case, makes it even more appealing.
I think adding "Job Offer" or "Training" on the subject wouldn't  harm
 anyone and it would be quite easy to filter out for people that are not
interested, as David very well suggested.
Thanks,
Santiago

Speaking of which, I've heard good things about Marlin Addition's upcoming

Perhaps you could request that Job offers, services, etc are made via a 
Web based template.
That way strict filtering could be applied easily by individual 
subscribers email programs.
The only thing that needs to be "strict" is the subject line prefix.

Hussein,



I had this problem in 1985 when we simulated an ice rink with DOE-2. This was documented in the paper:



Haberl, J., Claridge, D. 1985. ?Retrofit Energy Studies of a Recreation Center,? ASHRAE Transactions-Research, Vol. 91, Pt. 2, pp.

1421 - 1433 (June).



We seemed to be able to estimate the answer by raising the "A" in the "U x A x delta T" expression that relates to the conduction. A similar expression could be used to account for the heat gain from the infiltration/ventilation...

hello;
I am trying to simulate a walk in cooler in eQuest, but the zone entering supply air temperature under coil capacity/control, cooling control and reset is not allowing me to enter value below 55F. I need to set it up to 25 F. is there a way to overcome this problem.

Our local utility, Duke Power, offers consumers online energy savings
calculators. 
See
 
http://www.duke-energy.com/north-carolina/savings/calculate-your-savings.asp
 
I'm looking for something considerably more than just this however.
 
Is anyone aware of an online or standalone software tool that allows a
homeowner 
to track their energy use in response to energy efficiency measures taken?
Like
where they could create their own home energy profile, receive guidance on
ECMs 
ranked by ROI personalized for their home, then would show how their home
energy
use ranks relative to a database of comparable homes, i.e. EPA Targetfinder
but for
the residential sector (from the service utility for example)?
 
Thanks in advance.

You probably need to use some of the archived eQUEST releases:

 

Download a <http://www.doe2.com/download/equest/eQUEST_v3-61b_Setup.exe>
complete eQUEST version 3.61b installation

 

Download <http://www.doe2.com/download/equest/eQUEST_3-55_Refrig-Add-On.exe>
the eQUEST version 3.55 refrigeration version add-on

 

 <http://doe2.com/download/DOE-22/DOE22Vol2r-DictionaryRefrigeration.pdf>
Volume 2R: DOE-2.2 Language Dictionary: Refrigeration Version

 

These are made to work on refrigeration (i.e. cold rooms), and should avoid
the below 55?F issue

Hussein,

 

I had this problem in 1985 when we simulated an ice rink with DOE-2. This
was documented in the paper:

 

Haberl, J., Claridge, D. 1985. ?Retrofit Energy Studies of a Recreation
Center,? ASHRAE Transactions-Research, Vol. 91, Pt. 2, pp.

1421 - 1433 (June).

 

We seemed to be able to estimate the answer by raising the "A" in the "U x A
x delta T" expression that relates to the conduction. A similar expression
could be used to account for the heat gain from the
infiltration/ventilation...

Our local utility, Duke Power, offers consumers online energy savings

See

I'm looking for something considerably more than just this however.

 

Is anyone aware of an online or standalone software tool that allows a
homeowner 

to track their energy use in response to energy efficiency measures
taken? Like

where they could create their own home energy profile, receive guidance
on ECMs 

ranked by ROI personalized for their home, then would show how their
home energy

use ranks relative to a database of comparable homes, i.e. EPA
Targetfinder but for

the residential sector (from the service utility for example)?

 

Thanks in advance.

Hello, yes it's another Appendix G Baseline question.

 

Typical Residential Tower system with water-cooled heat pumps for the
dwelling units. Tower Loop is closed system with a heat injection boiler
for the winters (northeast climate). Heat injection boiler is natural
gas fired.

 

Is the Baseline "Electric and Other"? or "Fossil/Electric Hybrid"

 

I have seen many postings about WSHP being modeled as "all electric"
heating, but I am getting push back on this in the office because of the
heat injection component. Any CIRs on this one? System is obviously very
common.

 

Thanks

All,

For component level modeling challenges like constructing custom solar
thermal collectors, what sort of simulation tools would others recommend to
evaluate, i.e. heat transfer through different types of enclosure materials
into the receiving fluid, or different reflector shapes?

My first instinct would be to use something like IES and push the
temperatures out of range, then examine results at the surface level in
Vista.

Ideas?

Hm, I am curious about replies here. Wouldn't it make sense to break up 
the problem? Reflector design mostly would be about radiative transfer, 
so optical simulation tools would lead to an assessment of the 
irradiance on your absorbing surfaces. The second step would be to find 
the heat flow inside the piping as well as between pipes and surrounding.

Cheers, Lars.

As Lars pointed out, if you are indeed investigating a concentrating
collector (with a reflector), then the problem is probably more complex than
modelling a flat plate collector due to the importance of radiative
transfer. It looks like CoDePro only models flat plate collectors, but I've
never used it. There might be other tools out there, but if the design is
truly custom, you might need to develop your own computer model in something
like EES (which is exactly what CoDePro is) or Matlab, etc.

Regardless, the most complete reference for solar collector modelling is the
book "Solar Engineering of Thermal Processes" by Duffie and Beckman.

Cheers,

Marcus

I agree with Marcus here. The best that you could do in IES - 
practically - would be to utilise a polynomial representing the 
performance of the collector. Definitely no detailed analysis of the 
collector itself. The same would be true of E+.

Sounds like you could end up messing around in Trnsys or Matlab - not 
something I'd like to do!

You may want to take a look at Micheal Wetter's work with Modelica at 
LBNL. I don't think he's developed any solar collector models but 
Modelica is definitely the way to go for general purpose physics based 
component modelling.

Again, it's worth keeping an eye on the development of IDA ICE from Equa 
which has the best of both worlds: a friendly user interface for 
generating building models and an open interface to the underlying 
component models (many of which are written in Modelica). There's a 
schematic modelling interface enabling the user to build stand alone 
component models as well.

Thanks for the bibliography reference Marcus.

Regards

Chris

parameters should set? And any other caution should I pay attention to? Any
help will be apreciated.

Hey, thanks for the response. I agree, I think hybrid is the way to go
in this scenario.

 

One other issue I came across, since I not as familiar modeling
residential buildings, is the way that egress areas are treated. ASHRAE
list residential spaces as only including "guest rooms, living quarters,
private living space and sleeping quarters."

 

Does this mean the residential corridors and stairs need to be System 7,
and not PTAC, since the building is greater than 5 stories?

 

Thanks again,

Is the Baseline "Electric and Other"? or "Fossil/Electric Hybrid"

 

I have seen many postings about WSHP being modeled as "all electric"
heating, but I am getting push back on this in the office because of the
heat injection component. Any CIRs on this one? System is obviously very

FYI. 

Much of the research in this area was done in the 1980s and was documented in numerous SERI, Sandia and Los Alamos reports. Some of it continues today. Several handbooks document this, for example Kreider's book. 

Duffie & Beckman does a good job with most concentrating and tracking collector types. Kreider also had a textbook on medium and high temperature processes that covered a wider range of collectors.  

For ease of use, the FCHART software, available from Klein & Beckman easily analyzes many types of concentrating collectors using the utilizability method if you know the input parameters. I believe NREL also has an on-line analysis, as does our lab at ecalc.tamu.edu. 

There are also certain types of collectors that were extremely clever and good performers, although not in production today. For example the CPC collector with an evacuated tube, such as Sunmaster made. These were amazing collectors, but suffered from shattering under flash conditions. Today, evacuated tube collectors such as Thermomax do a great job and have reduced the flash problem using heat pipes. We used a collector of this type for our Solar Decathlon 2007 entry, papers and a report on this can be found on our website (we won the hot water prize).  Such collectors are hands-down winners for very cold climates. 

 Hopefully, more clever solutions will come along like these.

As Lars pointed out, if you are indeed investigating a concentrating collector (with a reflector), then the problem is probably more complex than modelling a flat plate collector due to the importance of radiative transfer. It looks like CoDePro only models flat plate collectors, but I've never used it. There might be other tools out there, but if the design is truly custom, you might need to develop your own computer model in something like EES (which is exactly what CoDePro is) or Matlab, etc. 

Regardless, the most complete reference for solar collector modelling is the book "Solar Engineering of Thermal Processes" by Duffie and Beckman. 

Cheers,

Marcus

	Hm, I am curious about replies here. Wouldn't it make sense to break up the problem? Reflector design mostly would be about radiative transfer, so optical simulation tools would lead to an assessment of the irradiance on your absorbing surfaces. The second step would be to find the heat flow inside the piping as well as between pipes and surrounding.

The team is requesting that you please verify the meaning of the
sentence in ASHRAE 90.1, Table G3.1 regarding baseline

envelope requirements for existing buildings.."For existing building
envelopes, the baseline building design shall reflect existing

conditions prior to any revisions that are part of the scope of work

windows, etc for the baseline is to be modeled to match the existing
conditions NOT according to the values in Table 5.5-1 thru 5.5-

2/20/2009 - Ruling

If an existing envelope component is untouched, the baseline is as that
component exists. However, if an existing component is

modified, the baseline needs to meet the requirements for alterations in
Section 5.1.3.

 

It indicates that when modifying the existing envelope, the baseline
needs to meet the minimum requirements of Chapter 5.

 

Have users in the group received comments from the reviewers when trying
to model modified envelopes at the existing performance values, because
all language regarding this issue other than the CIR indicate that
existing envelopes get to be modeled at existing performance conditions

So far as system type goes, consider that your building is first either
Residential or Nonresidential, and your building type determines your
baseline system.  

 

The only reason you'd have both building types (and thus 2  baseline
system types) is if you have non-predominant conditions per exceptions
to G3.1.1.  

 

If you've got >20,000SF of egress/back-of-house spaces, you might pursue
a second baseline system type declaring non-predominant conditions, but
for simplicity I'd be inclined to lump it all under one baseline type as
part of a residential building, unless told otherwise.

I have seen many postings about WSHP being modeled as "all electric"
heating, but I am getting push back on this in the office because of the
heat injection component. Any CIRs on this one? System is obviously very
common.

 

Thanks

So let?s be clear.  There is a major difference between code compliance (and
the methodologies for demonstrating it) and applying Appendix G for LEED.
There are also major differences is complying with 90.1 for a new building
versus an existing one.

 

The envelope provisions in Section 5.5 are not mandatory but are
prescriptive.  If you are complying with the code prescriptively then yes
you must comply.  As I understand it 90.1 will grant you a prescriptive
waiver for the envelope if a renovation does not affect the system in
question.  For example, if you replace windows they must comply for code
compliance purposes; if you don?t replace them the code does not make you do
so.   

 

If applying for LEED certification with an Appendix G model then you must
implement the mandatory provisions and show enough energy savings.  Since
the Section 5.5 envelope provisions are prescriptive you do not have to
comply with them.  The envelope in an existing building for the baseline
model follows Table G3.1.5(f).  The envelope in the proposed model includes
what has been designed and built.

The CIR is wrong and is in direct contradiction to Appendix G and the Energy

I have never seen a reviewer cite this CIR in a review.

Is anyone aware of this CIR being upheld?

 

12/10/2008 - Credit Interpretation Request

The team is requesting that you please verify the meaning of the sentence in
ASHRAE 90.1, Table G3.1 regarding baseline

envelope requirements for existing buildings.."For existing building
envelopes, the baseline building design shall reflect existing

conditions prior to any revisions that are part of the scope of work being
evaluated". Please confirm if this means that the walls, roof,

windows, etc for the baseline is to be modeled to match the existing
conditions NOT according to the values in Table 5.5-1 thru 5.5-

8.

2/20/2009 - Ruling

If an existing envelope component is untouched, the baseline is as that
component exists. However, if an existing component is

modified, the baseline needs to meet the requirements for alterations in
Section 5.1.3.

 

It indicates that when modifying the existing envelope, the baseline needs
to meet the minimum requirements of Chapter 5.

 

Have users in the group received comments from the reviewers when trying to
model modified envelopes at the existing performance values, because all
language regarding this issue other than the CIR indicate that existing
envelopes get to be modeled at existing performance conditions regardless of
any alterations.

 

Thanks

Equest has a model for both the loop field & the heat pump that take into
account the entering and leaving water temperatures from the loop field.
You need to make sure that the correct performance curves are selected for
the heat pump.

The EER of WWHP can vary from 11.8 to 23.3 depending on the water
temperature
returning from the well field.  Can Trace or Equest model this?

I'm starting to design a lot of geo-thermal systems, but I can't model the
well field performance, my models accuracy will be greatly affected.

Summary:
High-quality daylighting design has the potential to increase user
satisfaction and productivity and save substantial energy. However,
successfully designing daylighting into buildings in a manner that supports
high ratings of visual comfort while also saving energy can be a complex and
challenging process.
 
This workshop will allow participants to explore the interrelationship
between sky, site, building aperture, and space planning through lecture and
hands-on use of the Daylighting Pattern Guide. The interactive tool uses a
combination of real-world built examples and advanced simulation to set the
stage for substantial reductions in lighting power consumption and overall
building energy use.
 
The workshop will also include an introduction to the new daylighting design
tool DIVA-for-Rhino, a plug-in for the modeling tool Rhinoceros. This
hands-on introduction will allow participants to delve into additional
daylighting performance parameters for other particular projects.
 
The Daylighting Pattern Guide was developed by New Buildings Institute,
which manages Advanced Buildings with sponsor support, in partnership with
the University of Idaho and the University of Washington.
 
Participants will need a laptop with wireless internet connection in order
to access the Daylighting Pattern Guide online tool.

The Dayligthing Pattern Guide has been developed by New Buildings Institute
(NBI) as part of its Advanced Buildings? suite of tools and resources to
help design teams improve the energy performance of commercial buildings.

Hello all,

 

I was trying to find some guidance on how we are suppose to model baseboard systems on the baseline model for LEED submission. Are they treated like preheat systems where we must simulate them to be the same on both the proposed and baseline or is there some rule I'm not seeing in ASHRAE 90.1-2007?

So the interpretation would be that we must model the baseboard system with
whatever HVAC system is associated with the design while the baseline model
only has to include the system type spelled out in the guidelines?

Dear Will,

 

All baseline systems have some sort of (non-baseboard) heating as part of
the system.  Baseboard would only be used for a Proposed system.

Hello all,

 

I was trying to find some guidance on how we are suppose to model baseboard
systems on the baseline model for LEED submission. Are they treated like
preheat systems where we must simulate them to be the same on both the
proposed and baseline or is there some rule I?m not seeing in ASHRAE
90.1-2007?

 

Thanks!

	Services Offered

Thank you all for the great feedback. I went through all the 
comments and tried to figure out the best way to revise some 
of the guidelines that are at:

http://onebuilding.org/guidelines.html

Here is a draft of the revised guideline on job announcements:

OLD:   * Job announcements are welcome on the mailing lists 
but are restricted to one posting per month on your choice 
of one onebuilding.org mailing list.

NEW:    * Job announcements are welcome on the mailing lists 
but are restricted to one posting per month. The subject 
line must start with the words HELP WANTED. Announcements 
must be for a specific jobs available at time of posting.

And here are some new bullet on services offered:

NEW:  * Specific training classes may be announced but are 
restricted to two postings per class  on your choice of one 
onebuilding.org mailing list. The subject line must start 
with the word TRAINING.

NEW:  * New sources of weather data may be announced but are 
restricted to two postings per year on your choice of one 
onebuilding.org mailing list. The subject line must start 
with the word WEATHER.

NEW:  * If you are fully answering a question but also 
provide fee based support for future questions, you may 
include a single line in your signature block explaining 
services offered.

NEW:  * No other services may be offered on the mailing lists.

NEW:  * No resumes or help available postings are allowed on 
the mailing lists.

Changing the bullet about cross posting:

OLD:  * Cross posting the same message on multiple mailing 
lists is discouraged.

NEW:  * Do not post the same message on multiple mailing 
lists within 24 hours.

These are just draft changes. If you have suggestions for 
any further changes, please let me know.

Jason

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Which software to use?
Message-ID: <AANLkTimJhbxZZ_fNtBpAHLDS7LMWvCVZ9OtiSDGxmq1w@mail.gmail.com>

I will be undertaking energy simulations in the very near future for
building owners that are attempting to get federal tax credits under section
179D EPAct tax deductions.

I will NOT be involved in design, but verifying performance against
the reducing
the total energy and power costs by 50 percent or more when compared to an
ASHRAE 90.1-2001 reference building for lighting, HVAC and building
envelope.

I want to use the easiest to learn program since I will be working alone
without other colleagues to bounce questions off of so ease of use is pretty
important. I have done building estimating and used CAD and other building
programs before so I am not a complete novice, but I have never done any
energy modeling.

I realize ease of use often requires sacrificing more features. Since at the
moment my tasks will be fairly limited I am willing to sacrifice features
for ease of use.

Any help I could get on deciding which application to use would be very much
appreciated.

Sincerely,

Jim Verzino
