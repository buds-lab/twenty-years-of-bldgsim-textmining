For those of us who were not in Dallas, is there anyone who has the
information concerning what the licensing prices will be for EnergyPlus?
What will it cost to resell it, purchase it directly, etc.  Are those prices
set yet or are there ballpark figures available?  If so, how were those
prices set?  I checked the Energyplus website but it seems to only mention
the beta version licensing price.

Thanks,
Nate Blair

    Things have been too quiet so:

    At the IBPSA meeting in Dallas someone mentioned a variety of licenses
were available or pending for EnergyPlus. This was in response to my
marginally ignorant comment that `giving DOE free license to development
work done by the private sector seemed like a dis-incentive to private
sector development` (marginally ignorant because I haven't personally
examined the existing EnergyPlus licensing agreements)

    Any comments?

Mike,

May I suggest the TRNSYS program for this task.  The HVACSIM+ hot water to
air heating coil model has been rewritten as a TRNSYS module and may suit
your purposes.  I can send you the documentation for the model if you are
interested.  Also, the TRNSYS code is open so you could modify the existing
component or write your own if you wish.  The programs tremendous
flexibility would also allow you to control the coil in countless ways to
study the response.  Check out the TRNSYS web page at
http://sel.me.wisc.edu/TRNSYS for more information on the package or give
me a call if you have any specific questions on your project.

Sorry, I didn't make myself clear enough in my initial request.  I'm
looking for a model that will simulate a natural convection/radiation
coil such as fin-tube hydronic baseboard.  It should give the heat
transfer rate as a function of water flow rate, incoming water
temperature, and room conditions given some set of design parameters
to characterize the coil.  

Several have suggested the ASHRAE toolkits, but there are only
forced-air coils in the HVAC-2 toolkit and HVAC-1 is primary 
equipment.  So, I'm still looking . . .

Erwin,

Have you looked into SIMULAT, sponsored by the German Research Society or
RETC by the Scientific Software Group in Washington, DC?
The software relates to hydraulic conductivity of the soil in both saturated
and unsaturated conditions?  Algorithms are given for conductivity as a
function of the soil water content. The parameters of the model are taken
from the van Genuchten or Brooks and Corey equations describing soil water
retention.
I believe there's some other related software available.

The SIMULAT site is:  http://www.gsf.de/UFIS/ufis/modell65/gle319.html
The RETC site is:

Hello,

For the evalution of office ventilation, we try to model the dynamic
behaviour of ventilated ground tubes using Capsol software.
For this we are looking for the value of the thermal conductivity (l) of
common types of soil (humus, sand, loamy sand, loam, clay,..) and wet
soil, preferably in function of the moisture content. We would be very
happy if somebody could give us some references or values.
Are there any approaches to define 'equivalent' thermal conductivity

speed of the water?

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200003220828.AA284093MD21131@gard.com>

hi,

I've got a problem to model a water source heat pump with heat rejection to a cooling tower
and a gas fired boiler as a backup for my  water loop.

Here is what I've already done :

first ( Jeff advice) I created a heating/ventilating system   ( AIR HVAC ) assigned to a fake zone.
this is to model my make up air preheated, constant volume, @  55 F 100 % OA.

I created the water loop HP ( WATER HVAC ) with my boiler and my cooling tower.
in reality I have an evap. cooling tower BUT I considered an OPEN CT in powerdoe

Then my main HVAC system ( AIR HVAC) WATER LOOP HP type.
in that system I assign my outside air coming from my heating/ventilating system.

In my building as I have a bunch of heat pumps I entered my total
cooling and heating capacity in my system level and I entered for each zone
their own cooling and heating capacity depending on the number of heat pumps
( my total zone  capacities equals my system capacities)
I also entered my total flow ( corresponding to the recirculating and OA).

In my water loop (that as a 20 F delta T), I want the boiler to turns on only when my water loop
temperature goes below 75 F, and my cooling tower to reject heat when my water loop
goes above 80 F.

I entered the design GPM for my loop.

then comes the problem :

In my ouput

I almost don't have any heat rejection, and very small cooling.
( My EIR seems ok 0.015 for CT, 0.24 for HP)

I use a lot of electrical heat ( my heat pump meter is EM1) and I have rooms that remains
under 60 F with a setpoint @ 72 F.

But I use an incredible high amount of gas in my boiler..

plus I get these  error message

the first message  with the heat  and cooling capacity appears for all the zones !!
 Powerdoe do not appreciate that my heat pump heating capacity is higher than my cooling
capacity???

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] static pressure reset control
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200003170659.AA590368MD19910@gard.com>

In the "real "world" it is important to program the static pressure reset control strategy properly in order to get it to work.  If sp reset is a strategy that reduces the sp setpoint based on the most open VAV damper via an EMS, then it would only take one "rogue" damper that is stuck in the open position to defeat the control.  The damper could get stuck in the open position for a number of reasons:  the damper is simply inoperable and stuck, the temp sensor is reading high, the occupant has cranked down the thermostat, the vav box is undersized and unable to meet the load, etc.  These odds of any of these things happening of course increases as the number of zones increase.

In order to mitigate this effect, I would suggest adding two features to the sp reset controls sequence:
1.  Set a maximum or "not to exceed" sp setpoint.
2.  Base the current sp setpoint on an average of the most open two to four boxes, rather than just one.  This will reduce the effect of the rogue box.  The flaw with this is that if there is in fact no rogue box, then a warm room may become starved.  However, I would argue that if the VAV boxes are sized properly, it will simply take longer to cool the warm space.  If the boxes weren't  sized properly, the room would have been warm w/o sp reset anyway, and the underlying problem should be fixed.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200003170309.AA090293MD19854@gard.com>

Hello,
I've experienced a problem with the weather processor of micro-doe2 (pc
version of DOE2.1E vers. 58) trying to utilise the OTHER file type in the
PACK command.
My purpose is to convert measured data (DBT, RH, atm press, total horiz
radiation, wind speed and direction) to a DOE-2 packed and readable weather
file.
I have followed the instructions reported in the DOE-2 User New Vol 2, N.1,
Spring 99, but I don't succed to have any packed file.
Could someone help me (maybe providing samples of INPUT.TMP and WEATHR.TMP
files)?

Thanks

It would be the same for PIU or any VAV systems in DOE2.x:

I use a spreadsheet programmed with the algorithms of Englander and
Norford, outlined most clearly in an ACEEE paper (VSDs: Improving
Analysis...) in mid '90s. This is used to create custom fan curves
(FAN-EIR-FPLR = ) based on the total and static setpoints. The
baseline curve produced will calculate power at varying flow for
constant total and static setpoints. Then assume some reset in static
setpoints at lower flow rates.The evaluation of this curve will
produce comparatively lower power at partial flow rates. The reset of
the setpoint at patial flows is just a SWAG that depends on your
opinion of the sizing of the critical boxes.

This method doesn't use any feedback from the zones, which would be
needed to explicitly model this strategy, but the only way to do that
would be a function and DOE2.2 doesn't have functions, and accuracy
might not increase anyway. Note that in real, as opposed to virtual,
buildings, some engineers have said it is difficult to integrate this
with "warmest" zone SAT reset, and that SAT reset should be scheduled
if zone flow static pressure reset control is enabled. (Trane claims
they can do this however, and have some nice info on their website.)

Hi,

At the request of Dipak Shah of Honeywell, I am listing the websites that
BLDG-SIM members have directed me to in my search for German 30 year average
data.  Unfortunately, most of them are still works in progress.

NASA provides solar irradiation data for any place on earth based on
satellite measurements.  http://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/sse/


German wind energy institute (DEWI, http://www.dewi.de/) has some info on
wind. 
Try Fraunhofer Institute for solar systems (http://www.ise.fhg.de/) for wind
and solar data.


The University of Oldenburg. They have used Trnsys, so they should have some
suitable climate data, which you may be able to convert.

Again, many thanks to the BDLG-SIM members who have helped me,

However, for some reason, wind speeds are missing.  I have been using my
hourly statistical weather model to generate TMY2-like files for cities in
the WMO database.  If someone can provide average wind speeds for each
month, I could generate several of the above cities in TMY2 format.  These
data are averaged for the period covering 1961 through 1990. (This is the
latest data set as they are updated only once every 30 years.)

A second big IF, is if you are willing to utilize "statistically generated"
data.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] German 30 year average wind and solar weather data
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200003081041.AA412729MD17034@gard.com>

Does anyone know where I can find 30 year average wind and solar weather
data for German cities?  I am looking for average wind speed per month (12
values/year) and average daily sunshine % per month (12 values/year).  Any
format will do.  Many thanks to any who respond.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200003021504.AA045317MD15581@gard.com>

Anniversary
-----------

The BLDG-SIM list has had a good first year with over 200 
messages and about 300 subscribers.  I think it has 
maintained a high "signal-to-noise" ratio and has covered 
both nitty-gritty simulation detail questions and explored 
policy issues.  

Archive
-------

To see the messages posted to the list over the last year, 
please see the new web-based mailing list archive at:

http://www.gard.com/ml/bldg-sim-archive/threads.html

The archive has two limitations that hopefully can be 
resolved within the next year.  It has no search capability 
and it is manually processed.  The manual process means 
that their will be a delay of a few weeks between when a 
message is posted and when it shows up in the archive. 

Now that we have an web archive, I would encourage anyone 
that posts a question to later summarize the responses they 
get in a follow-up post.  It will help close the loop and 
make this mailing list even more useful.

Thank you all for a good year.

Jason
