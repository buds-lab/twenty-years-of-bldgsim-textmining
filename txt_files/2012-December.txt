Subject: [Bldg-sim] EPAct 179D Envelope Credit
Message-ID: <CALKTE9TPisD-0CLvPhUaVbp5vMu3Z-fDKj6ML=jD3cdMYtEUEQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear List-
I am researching the EPAct ?179D Energy Efficient Commercial Buildings Tax
Deduction, specifically the segment for $.60 per square foot building floor
area for building envelopes that contribute to %50 better than ASHRAE 2001.
  The main question I am attempting to figure out is if Phase Change
Materials could be used in conjunction with ASHRAE 90.1 2007 or 2010
prescriptive insulation and fenestration requirements (or better) to
achieve the tax credit. The projects that this would apply to are currently
going for LEED but may not be going for EPAct.  I am trying to figure out
how the envelope contribution to the %50 better than ASHRAE 2001
requirement is segmented to understand if these projects could be
applicable for the credit due to the advanced Phase Change Material
envelopes.

I understand that the procedure to follow is ASHRAE 90.1 2004, and the
baseline to be 50% above is ASHRAE 90.1 2001.

   -  Question 1: Is the calculation for %50 reduction similar to the LEED
   % of cost approach or if it is a % of energy basis?

The part I do not know is the multipliers to segment the envelope only
portion and associated modeling procedures.  If this is based on minimum R
values and maximum U values than our product would not contribute to the
%50, while if it is based on %50 energy reduction from the baseline
envelope energy use than phase change materials could contribute to the
credit and receive the $.60 per square foot building area.

   - Question 2:  How is the envelope segmented from the HVAC and lighting
   systems when applying for envelope only EPAct?

I have a budget to buy any required literature, but do not want to misuse
funds by buying unnecessary publications.

   - Question 3: Should I get ASHRAE 90.1 2001 and ASHRAE 90.1 2004, or can
   I find this info in the ASHRAE 2010 version I already own?
   - Question 4: Is there any other reference materials that are advised
   (free or purchased) to better understand EPAct rules and requirements?

Thank you in advance to anyone who shares their insights..

I would support everything a number of replies have indicated,  
including Timothy's.

We recently had a need to validate the effectiveness of shading in  
EnergyPlus versus IES VE.  Once input assumptions were aligned, the  
output was very similar for clear sunny days which is what you would  
expect given they have both been  BESTEST'd.  We did observe  
differences under highly diffuse conditions or where shortwave gains  
were dominated by ground reflectance or sky model differences.  Think  
of a north facade in summer at 30 Degrees latitude with a horizontal  
shade fully shading from beam radiation.  In these cases there were  
differences which at those points in time appeared significant, but  
the differences were small in the context of the shading that was  
occurring on the beam component or on the annual solar gains.  If you  
looked at annual cooling numbers the differences observed under  
diffuse or ground reflected conditions were noise compared to  
differences that may arise in the simulation due to other factors ...

Graham

1.  i would recommend obtaining 90.1-2001 and 2004 as the requirements 
of 2001 and the methodologies of 2004 differ from 2010.
2.  don't forget 179d requirements over-ride requirements of 90.1.
3.  do you have the 179d energy simulation guide?  this one is free from 
the nrel website. 40467.pdf is the name of it.
4.  the irs bulletins on the revisions for partially qualifying have 
changed over the years.  most recently (02/12) with an option to use two 
different percentage sets if the building is not fully qualifying until 
12/31/2013.  i.e. 10% building, 15% hvac/swh, 25% lighting OR 10% 
building, 20% hvac/swh, 20% lighting.  the old 16-2/3% for each 
discipline expired at the end of 2008.
5.  and if you're looking at partially qualifying don't forget a 
partially qualifying is each discipline by itself so you can't have a 
partially qualifying hvac/lighting only or hvac/arch.  it would be one 
simulation partially hvac, another partially bldg, or lighting.  and in 
the case of lighting you can use the interim lighting rules which 
doesn't require simulation.
6. can't help you with the use of phase change materials.
7.  the simulations start the same between leed and epact but a) you'll 
see more savings with epact, b) the baseline requirements are different 
(see the 179d simulation guide), and MOST importantly the 179d 
certification is a certification of what is installed on the project.  
i.e. who is field verifying what is there?  you are.  and you're 
certifying this to the irs.  this can make a large difference as far as 
hvac due to your having field measure fan flow, motor volts, and motor 
amps used.  as these should be less than nameplate data you'll see more 
energy savings.  yes, i realize some of the language in 179d reads 
equipment "that will be installed" but if you're using only catalog data 
(which can differ from nameplate) due to trying to certify before the 
building is constructed you won't see as much 179d savings.  don't 
forget you're also certifying building envelope installation and field 
measured lighting levels (there are lighting contractors that can 
provide this) per the 179d requirements.
8.  the 179d savings are an energy cost savings basis.  you have to 
break out the percent cost of energy used by each discipline from the 
total cost of the building based on the percentage energy used by each 
discipline.  see page 9 of the 40467.pdf from nrel.



9.  remember you're only comparing energy for building envelope, 
hvac/swh, and lighting.  as misc/other energies are energy neutral they 
don't impact your savings directly (unlike in leed).
10.  solar pv savings do not apply to 179d, and neither does external 
lighting (it's all internal lighting).  we could have a lot higher 
savings where i'm at if we could include external lighting due to 
stringent site lighting reductions trying to keep our skies dark and 
federally funded telescopes having great views.  solar thermal (swh) 
does apply.

Hi all,
I want to use sketchup 8 to make a simple model (a square shape and some windows) which can be used in energy plus. However, I found that the when I saved the model through Legacy openStudio plugin and open with idf editor, I could not even find a BuildingSurface:Detail. And then, I tried to find some model from internet, I still could not find BuildingSurface:Detail. So, what's wrong with that?
Hope someone can help me.

Dear simulation community,

The Python programming language is well known as a powerful tool in
automation, scripting, and high performance scientific computing. In our
experience, countless hours have been saved in automating building
simulation tasks, allowing us to focus more on creating quality building
models and accurate performance results.

We believe that Python is positioned to make a big difference in the
building simulation community. To get started, we have the following offer:
Send us your scripting problems, and we will solve them for you!

  Subject: [Bldg-sim] International Climate Zone specification
  Dear all,

  I am using eQUEST for a project in Spain and I have used the weather data from the EERE (Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy) website. The climate zone described in the weather file doesn't seem to agree with the one I calculate according to the ASHRAE 90.1 description for International climate zones, based on the precipitation levels. Has anyone had any similar problems with weather data outside the US? Any suggestions about dealing with this?

  Thank you in advance.

  Kind regards,

  Eleni

Just a quick guess.  Have you confirmed the outdoor air entering the 
building (infiltration plus ventilation air) during those winter 
months?  Also confirm HVAC systems run hours.  A balancing report is 
a good place to start.  Logging fan and pump hours helps especially 
if the BAC is already keeping those logs.

Hi guys,

Not sure if you (Marcus and Alan) remember me, but I tagged along on a lunch together when you visited NREL a while back. This sounds like a great and ambitious project. Of course, it's tied to a specific scripting language -- in this case, Python. I used to use Python a bit for just this type of Radiance automation, myself. The SPOT program (Radiance-based lighting photosensor placement and optimization tool) is a mix of Python and VBA. OpenStudio is primarily C++, but we export all of that C++ functionality to Ruby (and C#) in the form of SWIG "bindings". Much of the Radiance functionality in OpenStudio is actually a bunch of Ruby scripts. There are even elements of Radiance that are written in Perl. 

The point being that everyone has their favorite high level language. Our hand was forced to Ruby, simply because the OpenStudio project leverages SketchUp quite a bit, and the SketchUp API is in Ruby. It'd be great if we could leverage your (and your contributors') work in OpenStudio too, though. We should talk about how we might make that happen. I know SWIG supports Python, but the maintenance headache of supporting even just Ruby and C# is major; I doubt the team is interested in supporting yet another scripting language. However I do see an opportunity here, as we are rolling out the notion of "measures" in OpenStudio, which are pre-packaged energy efficiency measures (e.g. modify my model to have a WWR of .10 to .90 in .10 increments, simulate and compile the results, while I go have lunch). We should work together to see how we can best integrate your script library with OpenStudio and other tools. 

What do you think?

I'm confused by both the original post and the subsequent replies. What does this have to 
do with weather data  or with eQUEST?

Weather files do not list the ASHRAE climate region.  If you got a weather file from the 
EERE site,  then that's an EnergyPlus EPW weather file.  The ASHRAE Climate Zone shown on 
an EPW STAT file is calculated by the EnergyPlus weather processor in converting the 
source weather file into an EPW.  It has no bearing on the weather file itself.  If you 
think that the Climate Zone is in error, that only means
the algorithm used by the EnergyPlus weather processor to calculate the ASHRAE Climate 
Zone may be faulty for international locations.

Referring to this as a bug in eQUEST, or suggesting the problem might be the eQUEST *.BIN 
weather file are further off the mark.

Hi all,

I have simulated a building in Hong Kong by using Equest. In Hong Kong, winter is from Nov. to Feb. But I found that my simulation in HVAC part (end-use: space cooling + heat reject + vent. fan + pumps & aux.) in winter is much lower than the actual energy consumption in HVAC. So, could anyone help me to find why this happens and how can I solve it? inp and pd2 flies are attached for reference.

When you open one of the weather files (found in EERE website) as  
text, you can see the information on the ASHRAE climate zone. I don't  
think there is a bug in eQUEST since the climate zone definition  
doesn't depend on the software used for the simulation.

However, the description of the climate zone according to this doesn't  
seem to agree with calculations based on different data. So I am  
wondering, since I am using the EERE weather file for my eQUEST  
simulation for LEED, if I have to define the climate zone as found in  
the file or as calculated. I hope this makes sense and answers your  
question.

Thanks,

Eleni

You should read the notes at the bottom of the .stat files:

- **Note that the ASHRAE classification shown here is derived algorithmically from the source weather data.
 -   It may not be indicative of the long term climate for this location.


Use the information in  ASHRAE Standard 169 (or 90.1) to define the climate zone -- from the long-term statistics, not a 'typical' weather file.

Dear All,

I would like to simulate the temperature distribution around the building using CFD, external temperature.
Do you know any suitable software?
Is is possible to do it using Design Builder?

Thank you very much,
Jose

All,

 

Can anybody clarify with me how to model the following situation in both
the "As-Designed" and "Baseline" models in order to comply with LEED
protocol:

 

I have a plant that will serve two new construction buildings, with
condensing boilers and frictionless chillers. I am modeling the two
buildings separately, but I would like to take credit for the high
efficient equipment, therefore I believe that I should go forward with
Option 2 in Treatment of District or Campus Thermal Energy in LEED V2
and LEED 2009 - Design & Construction. How can I account for the
estimated load from the other building in a way that it remains
identical between the Proposed and Baseline cases? The baseline system
should be ASHRAE 90.1-2007 System #5, with DX coils.

 

Thanks for your help,

 

Scott

Subject: [Bldg-sim] WEATHER: Free tool for creating AMY-files for Europe
Message-ID: <CABxu1Epa5fJARbjW3odScZBQFEL7JJtpmjdoJVqqhtxg_da1zw@mail.gmail.com>

 Hi all,

The Real-Time Weather Converter tool for creating Actual Meteorological
Year (AMY) files for North Europe have been updated.

News for version 2.1:

   - Solar radiation data can now be retrieved from an arbitrary
   coordination point covered by the STR?NG modeling system. These data can
   for example be used for creating customized weather files by combing them
   with site-specific measurements of temperature and humidity and wind and
   atmospheric pressure data from the nearest official weather station.

News for version 2.0:

   - All data from ISD is available, also data marked as "Additional". If
   you tried the tool before but didn't get any data for your station, you
   should now be able to get usable data for most locations.
   - A new server that maps data from the SMHI server. Now retrieval time
   is just a few seconds for one year of solar radiation data. AMY-files can
   now be created in under a minute.
   - Missing data points are visualized graphically.

The tool was made as part of my MSc degree project at M?lardalens
University, Sweden. It uses observed actual weather data from the
Integrated Surface Database (ISD), http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/isd,
and modeled solar radiation data from STR?NG, http://strang.smhi.se.


Roughly, the tool covers most of Europe excluding south Europe. Long-term
coverage is from 1 of January 1999 to up to date for the northernmost area,
the southern area is covered from 1 of June 2006 (see website for map).

The quality of the solar radiation data from STR?NG varies in the
geographical dimension. Roughly the model gives good result for Sweden and
Central Europe, but underestimates for ocean coast near areas like UK,
Norway etc. The model does underestimate as well for the Baltics, northern
Finland and some high altitude sites. There's a validation figure (for
Google Earth) at the tools homepage in the help section.
Best regards,

Lukas Lundstr?m

Lucas,
Are you planing to expand to the USA or other global locations in the

I'm sorry, but it's a European only project because the solar radiation
data that is used is provided by the Swedish national weather institute.

Message-ID: <CAPiNA-+m+P5bOup6+TDsCmYP60q5qPoZ437KBTde0HOzs97oug@mail.gmail.com>

I am in the midst of modeling and analyzing heating usage for a
laboratory/classroom type of building. I am sizing everything similar to
the actual building, and setting plug loads according to the standards for
a laboratory; however, I am having trouble capturing the summer steam
usage. The current building has a great deal of summer heating, but I can't
seem to capture the heating for the summer. Has anyone had this sort of
trouble, and does anyone have any tips or advice?

David,

Summer steam loads, especially ones higher than average, are pretty typical for laboratory buildings.  Older ones tend to have high minimum air change rates that result in high reheat energy consumption.  If lab plug loads were as high as many planners suggest then you'd be getting "free" warming of all that ventilation air, but the reality that we and others find when benchmarking lab facilities is that plug loads are typically 50-80% lower than anticipated.  So, this is likely your main culprit.  You should also try to determine what process loads may be going on that require steam.  Additionally, you might be sure that your building isn't adding humidification unexpectedly post dehumidification.  Strange things can happen in real buildings.

Good luck.

Wahid,

The "Computerized Building Energy Simulation Handbook" is available for purchase at
http://abraxasenergy.com/store/#ecwid:category=2433186&mode=category&offset=0&sort=normal

However, it is not for novices. And it is geared toward the modeling of existing buildings (energy auditing mainly).

On the other hand, the COMNET book is very useful for compliance modeling of new buildings.

Cordially,

I see that these programs, namely EnergyPlus, can "describe" an load

The Smart Grid is about making energy decisions in real-time.

Jake,

You're going to need using some not so demanding mathematical skills here.  We all wish to get stuff done with a magic wand, right? :)
Take the output file of any energy simulation program, or a long enough set of monitored data, and use some day-typing analysis, and go with the 50th percentile of the hourly profile of a typical day (weekday, weekend, holiday, etc.).
That's all!  Check out the ASHRAE RP-1093.  Contact ASHRAE for a copy of the final report.

Good luck.

"Real Time Load Profiles" is a very generic term.  Since you mention 
SmartGrid, I assume you mean electric power use profiles. Timeseries CSV 
files are a common standard output from EnergyPlus and most tools 
(nearly all the example files produce some variation of this).  A single 
command in EnergyPlus will produce this directly as a csv file if you 
set the timestep = 60.

Output:Meter, Electricity:Facility, timestep;

The first column is date/time instead of seconds, but that can easily be 
converted inside excel.  This will give you minute-by-minute electric 
power consumption.  Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Jake,



You'll still have to process the data that is output from the program in a repeatable fashion. Therefore, I'd recommend you look at ASHRAE Research Project RP-1093 "Diversity Factor Toolkit".



It contains a set of spreadsheets that take as input 8760 hourly data and convert it into quartile plots that can then be used to determine such things as weekday or weekend profiles.  It also outputs DOE-2, BLAST and EP+ schedules that are representative of the mean profiles generated by the spreadsheet that can be cut-and-pasted into your input command file. Its great for making the 3-D plots as well.



Information about the project can be found in:


1.        Abushakra, B., Haberl, J., Claridge, D. 2004. ?Overview of Literature on Diversity Factors and Schedules for Energy and Cooling Load Calculations (1093-RP),? ASHRAE Transactions-Research, Vol. 110, Pt. 1 (February), pp. 164-176.

2.        Claridge, D., Abushakra, B., Haberl, J. 2003. ?Electricity Diversity Profiles for Energy Simulation of Office Buildings (1093-RP),? ASHRAE Transactions-Research, Vol. 110, Pt. 1 (February), pp. 365-377.



Copies of the final report, including the spreadsheet can be obtained from Mike Vaughn, Research Manager at ASHRAE.

"Real Time Load Profiles" is a very generic term.  Since you mention SmartGrid, I assume you mean electric power use profiles.  Timeseries CSV files are a common standard output from EnergyPlus and most tools (nearly all the example files produce some variation of this).  A single command in EnergyPlus will produce this directly as a csv file if you set the timestep = 60.

Output:Meter, Electricity:Facility, timestep;

The first column is date/time instead of seconds, but that can easily be converted inside excel.  This will give you minute-by-minute electric power consumption.  Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

But I really just want CSV files with these 2 columns:

Time (in seconds), Power (average)

The Smart Grid is about making energy decisions in real-time.
Does anyone know how to make these programs output CSV files for researchers like me?

Your advice?

Thanks all for the leads, I will follow up.

In open source spirit, if I figure out a way to wrap an "example file"
service I'll package it up and share it.
http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/cfm/inputs/

I suspect there are many people like me out there -- seasoned programmers
and R/Matlab types who are just trying to get sample data for time-series
modeling and regression/classification tasks.

Cheers,

Jake,

Since you mentioned smart grid I am assuming you want it in a format to import into Homer. You can do this quite easily in eQUEST when you select the hourly reporting options in the SIM file. The default reports hourly numbers from the electric & fuel meters which is probably what you are looking for.

"Real Time Load Profiles" is a very generic term.  Since you mention SmartGrid, I assume you mean electric power use profiles.  Timeseries CSV files are a common standard output from EnergyPlus and most tools (nearly all the example files produce some variation of this).  A single command in EnergyPlus will produce this directly as a csv file if you set the timestep = 60.

Output:Meter, Electricity:Facility, timestep;

The first column is date/time instead of seconds, but that can easily be converted inside excel.  This will give you minute-by-minute electric power consumption.  Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

I see that these programs, namely EnergyPlus, can "describe" an load profile of a device.
But I really just want CSV files with these 2 columns:

Time (in seconds), Power (average)

The Smart Grid is about making energy decisions in real-time.
Does anyone know how to make these programs output CSV files for researchers like me?

Your advice?

Thanks all for the thoughtful responses.

The Smart Grid challenge I am studying is predicting demand spikes so that
they can be better treated.
Demand spikes force Utilities to overcompensate in ways that are often
energy inefficient, costly for consumers, and worse for the environment.

I'm here because Smart Grid researchers have very little real-time load
data for individual homes and manufacturing facilities.
Thus, EnergyPlus and other tools may provide the best approximations
available.

Real-time simulated building load data could be a game changer for the
smart grid.
Assuming of course, that the simulated loads reflect actual experience and
that the data is easily accessible to Smart Grid investigators.

My 2 cents,
--Jake

I think E+ can do this when using the Zsz.csv file output, it
produces minute by minute intervals.  Below are two charts I created of the
cooling load profile and here is a link to live charts:
https://docs.google.com/a/phasechange.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ag7cD5ZV9QwRdFZxS0VmaXlhQ0ZQUzBidDFhdVNkVkE#gid=5

PCM's are very useful for demand shifting such as shown in these examples..

This new construction example with BioPCM in the exterior walls and above
ceiling tiles reduced demand by 36.34% or about 16.2 kW

[image: Inline image 2]

And this existing office building with BioPCM above ceiling tiles reduced
peak load by15.46% or about 5.3 kW.

Dear all:

(First of all, be careful with my sentences which might be miswritten,
because I?m not english native and in this topics about earned money or
billabe rates, we need to clarify and not to get hooked).

I?m continuing this post because I have some questions in order to unravel
the issue about Modelling. And I?ll start giving my gratefulness and
greetings to whom have written before.

Here is my list of questions/uncertainty related to .doc document attached
by Nick:


   - LEED are increasing his users/fans, and not only northamerica nor
   europe but south america is very close too, so, rates have to be universal
   or local? (it seem to me that this kind of filter dosen?t exist on GBCI in
   projects register matters).


   - we need to clarify skill levels on modelling. New? INtermediate?
   Advanced? Expert?


   - we need to clarify skill level on LEED modelling...


   - Misunderstood: if I pick up a project like "building energy
   evaluation" (and I alreday made my charge), and suddenly the mandator wants
   to get a LEED medal: the model is entirely drawn on software, I made my
   assumptions, and I?ve almost sent my results in an oficially report: the
   question is, how can I make another offer with Pasha?s cost logical? Are
   going to be the same hours (let?s say same example of 72,000sqft) to make
   LEED model?


   - What software I used to make my models? which one is free or which
   another is paid? is this going to make any difference with final price?


   - Do you have any way to compare "LEED" certification building model
   hour price, with some "energy evaluation" building model hour price? to
   make my own comparisons?


   - *Pasha?s* professional LEED hour rate it?s 60% over professional
   typical hour for whatever we are modeling without pursuing any
   certification.


   - some countries have very poor thermal standards, and we always are
   looking outside to make the difference to get/offer something better (in
   order to sustainability and eficiency) than 'we have'.


   - competition: small economies where few building are made per year
   (always comparing with USA or CA or Europe), how can I get prices agreement
   with my competition?


   - is it convenient to work on a project in an advanced design stage that
   suddenly wants to pursue LEED certification where we didn?t be before (I
   mean, have been part of the design team)?


   - can we do something similar to PassivHaus or BREEAM certification?


I think that?s all.
Thanks in advance and I?ll be waiting for any comments.

best greetings.

Hi all,
Thank you for commends. However, I still cannot get the things done because I do not understand some of yours words. 
For Chris, where can I adjust the infiltration and ventilation air during winter months? And I suppose HVAC systems, fan and pump running hours are same for both winter and summer since the office hours in winter and summer are same in Hong Kong. 
For Jeff, what do you mean by running the 4 months (Jan -Feb and Nov-Dec) in two runs? What are the runs specified for? Occupancy? HVAC systems? or other?
And any other people can give me some suggestions on solving the problems?
I think the big problem of my simulation is that winter's situation should be different from summer's situation but I still do not know which parts should I focus on and adjust the data.
Henry

Chris,
 
...to match actual data, you'll need 2 runs...Jan - Feb and Nov - Dec, then merge the two runs.

Just a quick guess.  Have you confirmed the outdoor air entering the building (infiltration plus ventilation air) during those winter months?  Also confirm HVAC systems run hours.  A balancing report is a good place to start.  Logging fan
 and pump hours helps especially if the BAC is already keeping those logs.

Hi all,



I have simulated a building in Hong Kong by using Equest. In Hong Kong, winter is from Nov. to Feb. But I found that my simulation in HVAC part (end-use: space cooling + heat reject + vent. fan + pumps & aux.) in winter is much lower than the actual energy
 consumption in HVAC. So, could anyone help me to find why this happens and how can I solve it? inp and pd2 flies are attached for reference.

Message-ID: <1355122172.57531.YahooMailNeo@web194002.mail.sg3.yahoo.com>

Dear all,


The project
is a 67000 sqft, six floored building. There are rooms with high equipment
loads of greater than 20W/sft . The total area of these type of rooms adds up
to 14,000 sqft. These high equipment rooms are 24x7 operating. We have modeled
baseline case considering PSZ-HP in all these rooms as per G3.1.1b. The other
spaces (office spaces) are modeled with VAV-PFP boxes. Is the
approach correct?

Thanks and Regards,
Rathnashree

Dear all:

(First of all, be careful with my sentences which might be miswritten,
because I?m not english native and in this topics about earned money or
billabe rates, we need to clarify and not to get hooked).

I?m continuing this post because I have some questions in order to unravel
the issue about Modelling. And I?ll start giving my gratefulness and
greetings to whom have written before.

Here is my list of questions/uncertainty related to .doc document attached
by Nick:


   - LEED are increasing his users/fans, and not only northamerica nor
   europe but south america is very close too, so, rates have to be universal
   or local? (it seem to me that this kind of filter dosen?t exist on GBCI in
   projects register matters).


   - we need to clarify skill levels on modelling. New? INtermediate?
   Advanced? Expert?


   - we need to clarify skill level on LEED modelling...


   - Misunderstood: if I pick up a project like "building energy
   evaluation" (and I alreday made my charge), and suddenly the mandator wants
   to get a LEED medal: the model is entirely drawn on software, I made my
   assumptions, and I?ve almost sent my results in an oficially report: the
   question is, how can I make another offer with Pasha?s cost logical? Are
   going to be the same hours (let?s say same example of 72,000sqft) to make
   LEED model?


   - What software I used to make my models? which one is free or which
   another is paid? is this going to make any difference with final price?


   - Do you have any way to compare "LEED" certification building model
   hour price, with some "energy evaluation" building model hour price? to
   make my own comparisons?


   - *Pasha?s* professional LEED hour rate it?s 60% over professional
   typical hour for whatever we are modeling without pursuing any
   certification.


   - some countries have very poor thermal standards, and we always are
   looking outside to make the difference to get/offer something better (in
   order to sustainability and eficiency) than 'we have'.


   - competition: small economies where few building are made per year
   (always comparing with USA or CA or Europe), how can I get prices agreement
   with my competition?


   - is it convenient to work on a project in an advanced design stage that
   suddenly wants to pursue LEED certification where we didn?t be before (I
   mean, have been part of the design team)?


   - can we do something similar to PassivHaus or BREEAM certification?


I think that?s all.
Thanks in advance and I?ll be waiting for any comments.

best greetings.

Hi, I?ve rewritten red words below (in blue) because they were sound wrong
to me when I read them again.
And, this comments are referenced to a very long .doc document attached by
Nick months ago, so, maybe you should read it before...


   - LEED are increasing his users/fans, and not only northamerica nor
   europe but south america is very close too, so, rates have to be universal
   or local? (it seem to me that this kind of filter dosen?t exist on GBCI in
   projects register matters).


   - LEED are increasing his users/fans and south america is not an
   exception. so, rates (It referenced to utility rates, billable rates..,
   what we, the modelers, 'have' to be paid for modelling works) have to be
   universal or local (Pasha mentioned a $0.20/ft2 based on his experience (I
   suppose he is an expert)... in other words, Do I have to charge for same as
   Pasha charge (suppose same experience on modelling) or do we need to adjust
   values considering different countries? (it seem to me that this kind of
   filter dosen?t exist on GBCI in projects register matters).


Thanks Carolyn for your comments, and hope this clarify you!

Cristian,
I think that each model is vastly different and must be priced based upon
the requirements of the project. For instance if there are complex systems
that can either not be modeled in eQuest or would involve very intensive
work around's that basically compromise the premise of using eQuest and
more capable software such as energy plus, TRNSYS or ESP-r would be
required and the modeler would have to do more work to complete the job
than they should charge more. (indoor swimming pools, variable refrigerant
flow heat pumps, green roofs and phase change materials come to mind)  The
challenge with charging the same for a non-compliance project such as an
energy audit model as a compliance project such as a LEED certification is
that there is less work for the modeler and more reward for the client for
a LEED project, so more value. You might want to start out with
Pasha's recommendation and then provide a "discount" if the model is of
simple basic systems  and the client is not pursuing platinum certification.
 Also keep in mind that commonly modeling is bundled with engineering and
design services offered by large firms with multi member teams so the value
for a "model only" from a free lance individual might be much less.
 Basically your service is worth what you say it is and so long as your
client is happy and your business is profitable you should be fine.

you must keep it blank ,when the TYPE command is GAS-ABSOR.if want to model absorption chiller (water cooled condenser),you can create a condenser Loop,then modify the CW-LOOP to the Loop which you create just now.

Message-ID: <95F0356A0810C44AB56ADD48FA44184101AF0ABF@greengo>

Hi all, 

 

I was looking for the maximum error allowed by LEED regarding the level of detail in the building model.

 

I have a little bit complex ancient building in a refurbished project. A "Hausmanian" building type with a lot of ancient balconies "closed" by windows (to gain surface). I read from ASHRAE 90.1 appendix G that balconies could not be modeled if we take in account the thermal characteristics of those balconies within the surface.

 

My question is more in the sense if someone of you have already experience regarding the simplification of complex fa?ade building projects for LEED. In particular,

 

Is there a maximum error allowed in LEED calculations concerning the difference between model surface and architect surface? 

 

Can we simplify complex facades?  For example this kind of facades:

Thanks in advance for your advice.

OBC SB-10 offers three paths for compliance (see Division 3, 1.1.2.1.(1):

(a) - MNECB performance path - show more than 25% 
savings over the MNECB, no changes to the EE4 
generated model required.  Note, there are no 
modifications to the MNECB required.

(b) - exceed ASHRAE 90.1-2010 by 5%.  This is the 
performance path, following 90.1-2010, Section 11 
with the modifications specified in Chapter 2 of SB-10.

(c) - meet the ASHRAE 90.1-2010 prescriptive path 
(with SB-10 Chapter 2 modifications).

If following the ASHRAE path make sure the 
project meets the mandatory requirements.  For 
example, Section 9.4, Lighting controls - all 
kinds of occupancy sensors required where the 
would not be if following the MNECB path.

If you are following the MNECB path, make it 
quick.  The Ministry is working to get software 
for following the ASHRAE envelope trade off 
method.   As well, canQuest is due out any day 
now and once it has been beta tested and 
approved, the MNECB and EE4 will be dropped from the OBC.

Join us *Tuesday, January 22* for the next meeting of the Rocky Mountain
Energy Simulation Engineers (RMESE). Chris Baker will be presenting on
"Minding the Gap":



*"Minding the Gap"*

The use of energy modeling to drive design decisions earlier in the design
process has long been recognized as an effective way to increase building
energy performance. With this in mind, several utility-sponsored Design
Assistance programs in the Midwest and Colorado regions expanded their
scope to provide comparative energy analysis of design options as early as
the building programming portion of the design process. These utility
programs attempt to influence decisions that significantly impact the
energy performance of the designed building. To be effective for market
transformation, these programs need to provide incentives for more
energy-efficient decisions that occur in the conceptual stages of design.
To calculate savings in a utility program and provide incentives that can
be defensible, a fair and consistent baseline protocol is needed. Appendix
G to ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-2007 is currently the most robust energy
modeling protocol that can be used by such incentive programs and rating
systems. However, this protocol does not provide adequate baseline criteria
to evaluate early design decisions, such as building shape, glazing and
skylight area and programmatic efficiency. To enable the calculation of
savings and incentives, Appendix G needs to be expanded to provide
additional baseline criteria.

This presentation explores where Appendix G falls short of providing
baseline criteria for decisions made early in the design process, and
proposes changes to Appendix G that would allow these savings to be
captured.

another 17 LEED Registered projects.

Mr. Baker received an MBA from the University of Minnesota and a Bachelor
of Architecture and Bachelor of Science in Architectural Engineering with
an HVAC emphasis from the University of Kansas. He is a Registered
Architect and Professional Engineer.

We will be meeting at *The RMH Group in Lakewood at 6:00 pm on Tuesday,
January 22* for a short presentation, appetizers, and drinks. The RMH Group

Addendum:  We are not yet able to offer our presentations as an on-line
webinar or streaming video.  We are looking into it for the future but
we're still just getting RMESE off the ground so it's probably something we
will grow into later.  Thanks for all the interest from afar!

I unfortunately am having trouble with the LEED submission process.  I have
a project that has had its initial Design Review completed and the team
would like to submit our responses to the review.  Other than making
changes to the credits/templates, where can we submit a
written narrative response to the review?  I have search LEED online, GBCI
and other online sites for answers unsuccessfully, they do have some great,
user-friendly websites.  I tried to avoid writing to the Bldg-sim list for
something like this, but i know people out there will have the answer.

Thanks in advance,

What I have done in the past is to make a document, usually a pdf, of my 
responses as a narrative, for each comment.  Revise the template and the 
submittals, but in the narrative pdf, say what you did and why you did 
it.  Call the narrative "response to comment XXX" or something and 
upload it to the credit section along with the new template, submitals, 
etc.  I have found that more documentation is more likely to be approved.

I have also done that in the past, but the template I am working on (IEQp1
in particular) has not allowable uploads on the website, so there is no
place for me to attach a PDF document or other information.

Thanks for the response.

I have a lot of experience with incentive 
programs and modelling to energy codes or 
standards that do not include any inclusion of 
economics - ie. how to define utility rates how 
to avoid fuel switching between proposed and 
Baseline cases when the Baselines systems can 
look significantly different than the proposed 
case systems.  Not particularly by choice but more by age.

The Canadian Federal government instituted 
incentives for showing energy savings over first 
the ASHRAE 90.1-1989 Baseline.  The C2000 program 
defined how the energy savings were turned into 
cost savings incentives  - I can remember any 
modifications to 90.1 but the way energy 
efficiency measures were implemented and modelled 
or post simulation adjusted.

This effort somehow morphed in the Green Building 
Challenge of which the energy model was a very 
small component of the overall rating.  Again, I 
don't recall any specific modifications to the 
90.1 Baseline case but how the proposed was 
modelled and how savings were calculated was defined for that program.

Then the MNECB came out with a whole building 
performance path.  This was very loosely defined 
and the first step was to define the modelling 
software requirements, then how the Proposed and 
Reference cases were to be modelled.  The first 
incentive programs were based on fairly strict 
requirements and a "help" system was published to 
assist users with the model requirements without 
defining any keywords, explicit software 
etc.  DOE2.1d/e was available at the time - no 
interface at all.  Text editor and debug.

The review process was quite 
interesting.  Somehow I had ended up modelling 
the first LEED Gold project awarded by the USGBC 
in Canada.  This qualified me to review MNECB 
incentive models - Proposed and Reference case 
soft ware supplement and the help system.

My main point is that incentives typically 
regionally based.  The state, or other authority 
has to base the incentive program on local, 
typical "baseline" construction and 
economics.  Appendix G doesn't necessarily have 
to be revised to take into account these regional 
requirements.  I think it would be very difficult 
do modify A global standard to include some 
accounting of regional requirements for developing local incentive programs.

Rob,

 

If you have elected to use the form to show your VRP calculations, I believe
the access to the document upload section in LEED online may be accessed by
indicating that an alternate compliance path is being used. This should open
a narrative box in which you should note that you are NOT using an alternate
compliance path, just using this method to enable uploading documents. Hope
this helps!

I have also done that in the past, but the template I am working on (IEQp1
in particular) has not allowable uploads on the website, so there is no
place for me to attach a PDF document or other information.

 

Thanks for the response.

Call the narrative "response to comment XXX" or something and upload it to
the credit section along with the new template, submitals, etc.  I have
found that more documentation is more likely to be approved.

That's surprising.  I just looked at an old project, and IEQp1 allows 
uploads, or at least it did before it was certified.

It has "other documents" right on the bottom for miscellaneous uploads, 
and I have one on there called 
"IAQ-Prereq-1Technical-Advice-Response.pdf" that I prepared and 
uploaded.  I have no idea why yours won't allow it.

Message-ID: <CCF0AA6F.17D5C%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>

Happy Friday!

Just a quick note to let y'all know that we have updated all of the
Radiance binary installers, and they are available for download at the
NREL OpenStudio website. Specifically, here:

https://openstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started-developer/getting-started-radia
nce

Scroll down a tad, and you'll see a section called "Download Radiance
Binaries". We offer Windows 32-bit, MacOS Universal, and Linux 32-bit and
Linux 64-bit. 

Chris Humann, I went back to dynamically linked libraries, so these won't
work for ya on OSX 10.5, sorry. There have been a bunch of updates and
fixes to a lot of the three-phase stuff for Windows, so Windows users
should definitely grab themselves a copy. This round should also fix the
Qt Rvu for many users. Please let me know if you have any difficulties
with the new packages.

Have a good weekend,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Unit heaters WRT LEED requirements
Message-ID: <005301cdda48$a87d8030$f9788090$@com>

All,

 

I have an appendix G (2007) LEED question on Unit heaters.  My proposed
building has some heating-only spaces, mechanical rooms & the like, which
are served by hydronic unit heaters - capacity under 20kbtu each.  How
should these spaces be handled in the LEED baseline?  The overall system for
the rest of the spaces in the Baseline model will be a System 5
(nonresidential, 5 floors or less, between 25kSF & 150kSF, purchased heat).
Section G3.1.1 exception b seems to indicate that the heating-only spaces
should be served by a separate System 3 in the Baseline model.  Is this
correct?

 

Thanks,

Steven

Dear users:

I'd like to know if there is a way to know the calculated response factors
