Subject: [Bldg-sim] EnergyPlus VRF + DOAS modeling
Message-ID: <CAOfOiCEtObVV5Jo+YB5W6Kqo1EN-5nz69RAhNq40=ETD8Ww60Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Bldg-Sim Group,

I am working on variable refrigerant flow (VRF) system modeling using
EnergyPlus to understand energy savings compared to other conventional
systems.

For VRF modeling,  I utilized the example file
"VariableRefrigerantFlow_5Zone.idf". This example uses outdoor air mixer in
each VRF indoor unit for the supply air which goes through cooling and
heating coil to the zone inlet node.

But, a typical VRF system practice uses a separate DOAS system to reduce
cooling and heating load in the VRF side only recirculating return air to
be conditioned.

I am trying to add DOAS in the VRF modeling. The problem is that
HVACTemplate:DOAS (in EnergyPlus 7.2 or 8) does not support this.

Is there anybody who did VRF system modeling with adding DOAS?

Thank you!

Hi Xiwang,

 

The TRNSYS interface has been tested on Windows 32 bit but you should be
able to use the interface on Win64 bit, if you use the 64 bit version of the
BCVTB/TRNSYS types. 

You might want to contact  your TRNSYS distributor and see whether they
could provide you with TYPES compiled for Windows 64bit.

 

Best,

 

Thierry

We are pleased to announce the release of the Building Controls Virtual Test
Bed 1.3.

 

The following changes have been made compared to version 1.2:

 

* TRNSYS  has been added as a client program.

* The Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) for co-simulation import interface has
been added.

* The example files have been updated for EnergyPlus 8.0. 

 

The Building Controls Virtual Test Bed (BCVTB) is a freely available
open-source software environment that allows expert users to couple
different simulation programs for co-simulation, 

and to couple simulation programs with actual hardware. For example, the
BCVTB allows to simulate a building in EnergyPlus and the HVAC and control
system in Modelica, 

while exchanging data between the software as they simulate. The BCVTB is
based on the Ptolemy II software environment. 

The BCVTB allows expert users of simulation to expand the capabilities of
individual programs by linking them to other programs. 

Due to the different programs that may be involved in distributed
simulation, familiarity with configuring programs is essential.

 

Programs that are linked to the BCVTB are

 

* the EnergyPlus whole building energy simulation program,

* the Modelica modeling and simulation environment Dymola,

* the MATLAB and Simulink tools for scientific computing,

* the Radiance ray-tracing software for lighting analysis,

* the ESP-r integrated building energy modeling program,

* the TRNSYS system simulation program, 

* Functional Mock-up Units (FMU) for co-simulation,

* the BACnet stack, which allows exchanging data with BACnet compliant
Building Automation System (BAS),

* the analog/digital interface USB-1208LS from Measurement Computing
Corporation that can be connected to a USB port. 

 

In addition to using programs that are coupled to Ptolemy II, Ptolemy II's
graphical modeling environment can also be used to define models for control
systems, for physical devices, 

for communication systems or for post-processing and real-time
visualization.

*Presentation I: A demonstration of AECOSim Energy Simulator, the latest
GUI for EnergyPlus*
Drury B. Crawley - Director, Building Performance, Bentley Systems, Inc.

Description

AECOsim Energy Simulator (AES) is a full-featured, graphic interface for
building performance simulation built from the ground up based on the
latest EnergyPlus (v7.2) simulation engine. AES was initially released by
Bentley Systems in September 2011. This demonstration will first cover the
interface including the ribbon bar; tree for navigating spaces, walls,
windows, doors, ceilings, roofs, internal loads, HVAC components, and
zoning; BIM interface to visualize building models. How to create an AES
building model will also be shown: Conceptual Design (13 inputs, sketch the
building outline, select HVAC system); import 2-D CAD and trace the
building and spaces; import gbXML; or import graphics (bitmap, JPEG, GIF,
PDF) and trace spaces.

Then, the HVAC Designer will be shown along with 31 preconfigured HVAC and
SWH systems (preconfigured systems automatically create the all the
necessary EnergyPlus nodes, branches, and connections). The HVAC Designer
makes it easy to configure the more than 50 HVAC Designer components and
create or modify systems using a visual drag and drop system. Finally,
automated creation of baseline and budget buildings for ASHRAE 90.1 will be
shown as well as results from ASHRAE RTS/heat loss and EnergyPlus
simulation.

Sang Hoon,

The point of the HVACTemplate files is to demonstrate how the nodes and
branches are configured.
Using the DOAS and a zonal system template will show you how to configure a
system with a ventilation system and separate zonal cooling / heating
system.

I suggest using the HVACTemplates for DOAS and WaterToAirHeatPump to create
the node connections. Upon running, this will create a file '.expidf' which
is the HVACTemplates expanded out to full .idf.
You can rename this file to be extension .idf and edit it like a normal
.idf

Modify this renamed expanded HVACTemplate file, remove the zonal
WaterToAirHeatPump objects and replace them with the VRF terminals
following the example you are using.

Hope this helps,

Jason

Dear Anderson,

The example file (in EnergyPlus 8.0) is indeed what I was looking for.
This has AirLoopHVAC for DOAS and VRF system, which has separate coils
assigned for each system controlling temperature and humidity.
Great!

Thank you!

Message-ID: <CAETHmJ6NjaD+tJTD00MO55wDDxL0DMS1tA3269fVEkoBPnOWHQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, all,

I'm trying to model a PTAC system with economizer within E+ environment.

The specification of the system is:

The OA economizer here is to provide "free" cooling during times of cool
ambient conditions. The amount of outside air taken into the building will
vary between the design percentage and the maximum percentage. And
the design percentage of OA of the system is not defined as related to
occupancy or floor area but 25% of total supply air.

I read the I/O reference about Controller:OutdoorAir, but it seems:

"If all the limits are satisfied, the outdoor air controller does the
following for cycling fan systems: the outdoor air flow rate is set to the
maximum when the fan cycles on. If the limits are not satisfied, the
outdoor air flow rate is at the minimum when the fan cycles on."

The problem is it's either minimum or maximum instead of modulating
according to outdoor and return air condition?

Does anyone have suggestions on this? Help greatly appreciated.

Do I have to go to EMS for this control scheme?

Best,

Qinpeng

Message-ID: <51B10D65.1090406@gmail.com>

Folks

I want to compile the fortran code that comes with the Inverse Modeling 
Toolkit report (ASHRAE RP-1050). The downloaded ZIP file contains 
pre-compiled IMT.EXE for MS-Windows. I want to compile it in Linux using 
gfortran.

A quick and dirty attempt to compile produce the following result:

*******************
$ gfortran IMT.F90
/tmp/ccVxJVqG.o: In function `process_cmd_line.1953':
IMT.F90:(.text+0x22ea0): undefined reference to `command_line_'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
*******************

I presume that it requires the libraries to be able to compile it.

Is there anybody who has done this before? Any pointers on how to fix this?

Thanks

Qinpeng,
Normal PTAC equipment does not ever have an economizer, so the E+ object does not allow it.
If you really need to model a DX cooling system with economizer, construct an E+ air loop with equivalent components for the fan, DX coil, supplemental heat, etc.

Hi, all,

I'm trying to model a PTAC system with economizer within E+ environment.

The specification of the system is:

The OA economizer here is to provide "free" cooling during times of cool ambient conditions. The amount of outside air taken into the building will vary between the design percentage and the maximum percentage. And the design percentage of OA of the system is not defined as related to occupancy or floor area but 25% of total supply air.

I read the I/O reference about Controller:OutdoorAir, but it seems:

"If all the limits are satisfied, the outdoor air controller does the following for cycling fan systems: the outdoor air flow rate is set to the maximum when the fan cycles on. If the limits are not satisfied, the outdoor air flow rate is at the minimum when the fan cycles on."

The problem is it's either minimum or maximum instead of modulating according to outdoor and return air condition?

Does anyone have suggestions on this? Help greatly appreciated.

Do I have to go to EMS for this control scheme?

Best,

Qinpeng

Subject: [Bldg-sim] jEPlus V1.4 released
Message-ID: <770DA51B8CC79343A32830010D6E379A10BE8C70@PC3XMB-0002L.LEC-ADMIN.dmu.ac.uk>

Dear Colleagues,

We have finished beta-testing of jEPlus V1.4; it is now released. As usual, we didn't receive much bug reports from users, but we managed to find some on our own - it wasn't that difficult, actually ;-) Should you find any issues or need more functions, please feel free to post them on the discussion page: http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jeplus/wiki/doku.php?id=discussion_main.

Apart from bug fixes, the main difference between 1.4 Beta and v1.4 is the command-line interface. It has been completely rewritten, to give script users more control over how the simulation jobs to be executed, without the need for opening GUI. Here is an example:

java -jar jEPlus.jar -job example_E+v8.0/HVACTemplate-5ZoneFanCoil.jep -lhs 20 -seed 1234567 -cfg jeplus_v80.cfg -local 2 -output ../CmdLineTests/output/

This command will run a Latin Hypercube sample of 20 jobs, of the given project, with a specified random seed, using E+ V8, on two processor cores, and write all outputs to the given folder. jEPlus will execute the jobs and then exit quietly, leaving the usual output tables in the given folder. Using the command-line options, it is very easy to couple it with your own scripts, e.g. in Matlab, Python and so on. More information can be found in the User's Manual: http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jeplus/wiki/doku.php?id=docs:manual_1_4.

Best regards,

Yi

Fellow Building Simulationists,

I know you've already seen several emails about our proposal to improve how
people get answers to their simulation related questions. If you haven't,
here is a link to the site:

http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/45232/building-energy-modeling

Thanks so much to those of you who have already joined and followed the
effort. We now have more than 200 followers (which is more than most of
these sites can claim)!

BUT it's not only the number of followers that will help us realize our
goal. We need everyone to VOTE! Voting on questions is how we prove to the
people hosting the site that our community has a well defined topic and
scope to warrant a site specifically for questions about "Building
Performance Simulation & Analysis".

We are so close to moving on to our next phase. Even if a handful of people
who have already signed up return to the site to use their allotted 5
votes, we can probably reach our goal of 40 questions with 10 or more votes
within a matter of days.

So please, take just a few minutes to go to the site and vote on some
questions that do not yet have 10 votes and help us improve the support for
our community!

http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/45232/building-energy-modeling

If you have any questions or problems navigating the site, don't hesitate
to send me an email.

Thank you!

Message-ID: <1B23446CBF250648A2FC775DE3FE7E800FF03F01@OC11expo28.exchange.mit.edu>

Dear colleagues:

This is a reminder that the early bird registration for DIVA DAY 2013, which will be held on July 15th in New York, ends this Friday. To register please go here<http://www.solemma.net/DIVA-for-Rhino/Diva-Day-Early-Registration.php>.  A current agenda for the day can be accessed here<http://diva4rhino.com/diva-day-2013/agenda>. Some of you might also/instead be interested in a three day Executive Education Program<http://execed.gsd.harvard.edu/programs/daylighting-buildings-1> on Daylighting Buildings at Harvard on July 8-10.

Who should attend which event?

DIVA DAY is most suited for two different groups: Practitioners or educators who are either are already familiar with daylighting and energy analysis and who would like to actively participate in a discussion of how to apply them in practice or to teach them at the university level. If you fall into this category you will get a lot of new ideas that you can directly apply. Alternatively, you may be a practitioner or educator who considers adding daylighting and energy analysis to your skill set but you first want to see whether this is worth your time. The day provides good networking opportunities for both groups.

The Executive Education Program is effectively a compressed three day version of the MIT Daylighting Class. We will be going through the theory and practice of conducting advanced daylight simulations and glare analysis using Radiance/Daysim and E+ as well as HDR photography. On days one and two we will go back and forth between presentations and hands on exercises. On day three participants will work on a project of their own with support provided by the instructors. If you take this class, you will learn how to actually do simulations or what pressing certain buttons actually means.

We scheduled the two events back to back so that you can first learn the theory and then participate in the discussion, all in one week.

All the best,

Christoph

I'm more agnostic about this. ASHRAE Climate Zone 1 (Miami) is very hot as well as humid.  
Hopefully, there was some analysis done showing that economizers are not cost-effective 
under such climate regimes.

Chris,
More warm weather  = less available cooling from outdoor air = less justification for spending money to install economizer controls.
p.s., You must provide minimum outdoor air for ventilation, but need not also cool with outdoor air

Hi Joe,

1a I understand. But we are looking at a 1b location (Hot/ Dry). Surely the
best approach would be economiser with DB control?

Curiously, in my copy (90.1 2007) economisers are not required in *1b
*(table G3.1.2.6A).
However, the following table (G3.1.2.6B) denotes that economiser high limit
shutoff should be 75degF for *1b*.

Am I missing something fundamental about the physics of non-extant
economisers?

Thanks Jim,

So your understanding is that a mixing box still exists, but the control
that varies outdoor air rate doesn't exist. It is in effect a fixed outdoor
air rate.

??

Many thanks

Thanks Jim,

So your understanding is that a mixing box still exists, but the control that varies outdoor air rate doesn't exist. It is in effect a fixed outdoor air rate.

Many thanks

Great. A minor conundrum remains, quoting:

*"Curiously, in my copy (90.1 2007) economisers are not required for
1b (table G3.1.2.6A).
However, the following table (G3.1.2.6B) denotes that economiser high limit
shutoff should be 75degF for 1b."*

Who knows?
However, and until corrected by another who knows better, I would follow the instruction to leave out an economizer in Climate Zone 1b because it seems consistent with the pattern for warmer climates.  My guess is that a zealous engineer mistakenly populated the table (6B) for that zone.

Message-ID: <4016B1EA0C8DA84D88D1E20A29CD3E79E114DEB4BD@TOR-SVR-EX5.mcw.com>

Hello
I am looking for helps on how to model pool dehumidification in ASHRAE 90.1 ECB.
The proposed design of pool dehumidification is:  water cooled cooling (ground source), hot water heating
Using Figure 11.4.3, it would be system 7 (four pipe fan coil)
Is it a right approach? Or shall I model an identical system (DOT) system in budget model, which I consider the system is beyond figure 11.4.3 (applying item 11.4.3 (a))
Thanks,
Xiangjin

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Recommended reading on comparison of models to actual?
Message-ID: <CAPsP_xQWEUCogkSDC==4T5YpkAm8JyuSfQi2GK392j19v3=xTQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear bldg sim,

I am looking for papers that elaborate on the concept of modeling, and how
it correlates to actual utility data to share with people within my company.

The questions keeps popping up, eg..

   1. How does a baseline building compare to an average building?
   2. How does a proposed building typically stack up against the utility
   bills once the building is built?
   3. How accurate an existing building model should be to be considered
   useful, and how accurate is typically possible?
   4. For an experimental setup what would be considered to be close enough
   to be considered a "validated" model?

My understanding is that modeling is to show relationships between average
a baseline of a chosen vintage and that of a proposed design in terms of
relative percentages.  For existing buildings I think that useful is within
20% and typically possible is 10%. Then for a validation model, the most
important factor is similar curves and close totals.

If anyone has any recommended papers, or personal experience it would be
appreciated.

Kind regards

Help Wanted - Senior Building Energy Modeler

Big Ladder Software is looking to hire a senior building energy modeler to
help us expand the services and software that we offer.

*About Big Ladder Software*

Big Ladder is a Denver-based company dedicated to providing services and
software *for energy modelers*. The company name reflects our mission to
"help our clients reach new heights". Founded in 2009, we are a team of
engineers and computer programmers who are passionate about developing
innovative open-source software tools for the modeling of buildings,
transportation, communities, and all areas of energy efficiency and
renewables. We primarily use the EnergyPlus simulation engine to perform
whole-building energy analyses. We also offer training workshops,
commercial support, and custom software development services for EnergyPlus.

*Job Description*

This job is for a full-time position at our Denver location. A flexible
remote-working arrangement may be possible in some cases. If hired,
responsibilities would include:

- performing building energy analyses using EnergyPlus
- providing support for our clients using EnergyPlus and our software tools
- teaching training workshops on EnergyPlus and our software tools
- developing training materials and tutorials
- influencing the direction of new software tools for energy modeling
- authoring white papers, technical papers, and blog posts on energy
modeling topics
- growing and leading a small team of energy modelers
- developing business opportunities for new work

*Job Requirements*

To be considered for the job, you should be able to demonstrate the
following minimum requirements:

- deep expertise in using one of the main energy modeling engines
(EnergyPlus*, eQUEST/DOE-2, TRNSYS, IES-VE, ESP-r, TRACE)
- deep knowledge and understanding of building science and HVAC systems
- excellent people skills
- excellent writing skills
- excellent presentation skills
- ability to work independently

**Previous experience with EnergyPlus would be a bonus, but not a
requirement. As needed, we would train you fully on EnergyPlus and our
software tools.*

Finally, this might be the right job for you, if you agree with most of the
following statements:

- you find yourself pushing the limits of your energy modeling tools on a
daily basis, and it frustrates you to no end
- you have worked at a mechanical or architectural engineering firm and
have performed or been heavily exposed to design work
- you considered becoming a teacher or a professor at some point in your
life
- you have an entrepreneurial streak that has gone untapped for too long
- you have been looking for an excuse to learn (and become insanely good
at) EnergyPlus
- you think there MUST be better ways to do software for building energy
modeling

Jeremiah,

I think you'll find a room full of experts and lots of advice on this at the upcoming SPC 209 Meeting at ASHRAE in Denver. I've enclosed a copy of the agenda, as well as the Chair's email, Jason Glazer. Part of the work for 209 is assembling the list you are looking for.

Also, you'll find useful information in the new Guideline 14, and in the Energy Management Handbook, by Doty and Turner. www.ibpsa.org<http://www.ibpsa.org> and the www.esl.tamu.edu<http://www.esl.tamu.edu> are also good places to check as well.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Recommended reading on comparison of models to actual?

Dear bldg sim,

I am looking for papers that elaborate on the concept of modeling, and how it correlates to actual utility data to share with people within my company.

The questions keeps popping up, eg..

  1.  How does a baseline building compare to an average building?
  2.  How does a proposed building typically stack up against the utility bills once the building is built?
  3.  How accurate an existing building model should be to be considered useful, and how accurate is typically possible?
  4.  For an experimental setup what would be considered to be close enough to be considered a "validated" model?
My understanding is that modeling is to show relationships between average a baseline of a chosen vintage and that of a proposed design in terms of relative percentages.  For existing buildings I think that useful is within 20% and typically possible is 10%. Then for a validation model, the most important factor is similar curves and close totals.

If anyone has any recommended papers, or personal experience it would be appreciated.

Kind regards

Jeremiah,

That is an important topic among researchers and practitioners in the
simulation community for the last 20-30 years.

I made a presentation on this topic in a public EETD/LBNL seminar, A closer
look at the energy performance of buildings: simulated vs. measured. Slides
are available in PDF at
http://eetd.lbl.gov/news/events/2011/03/03/a-closer-look-at-the-energy-performance-of-buildings-simulated-vs-measured

I have some journal articles discussing related topics. You can find them
by using the Google Scholar.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Simergy - Does anyone uses this software
Message-ID: <000c01ce6cfc$23c1b9a0$6b452ce0$@blcnavitas.pt>

Hello,

 

I am trying to initiate on Simergy and it is being a very difficult task (I
am use to work with HAP and DesignBulider). They don't answer to my
questions, the help guide is basic and the tutorials can't help me either. 

 

I would like to know if someone in this group works with this Software. 

 

I am trying to create a building with a custom zone configuration. Does
anyone know how to create those zones? Is it necessary to draw a custom
space and draw the internal walls exactly in the same space? Or is there a
way of doing just one thing? For example, create the internal zones just by
drawing the internal walls. 

 

Thank you, in advance.

 

Best Regards,

Guilherme V. Martins

Guilherme,

Alan Jackson from Case Inc, recently demo'ed Simergy at the IBPSA NYC
chapter meet. He covers the topic of creating zones from scratch. Check out
the video here: http://vimeo.com/67586999

Note: His presentation starts about half way thru this video.
Hope this helps!

Message-ID: <ECDF361A89E5FA479BE7E64C658B52051C0BE898@SANDBINC4.sbi.smithboucher.com>

Hi everyone,

Found this short article an interesting read.  Provides an overview of how advanced lighting controls will work their way into our energy models under LEED v4.  "Advanced lighting controls" include manual/programmed/daylight dimming, multi-level switching, and task-ambient workstation lighting with dimming/sensors.

http://www.ies.org/lda/HotTopics/LED/15.cfm

The response provided by USGBC for this article appears to technically conflict with the usual language in Appendix G Table 3.1, section 6 (or at least my current copy - there may be current/future addenda I'm missing), but it sounds as though we'll be permitted to document and work additional LPD allowances into the baseline lighting power densities.

I expect mindful LEED v4 modelers of the future may be well-advised to work" potential impact of advanced lighting controls" into their DD-stage LEED assessments, to put the lighting designers on notice at an early enough juncture to realize the benefits...

Regards,

~Nick

Message-ID: <49E64E72AF0C3748B10021A8D95CAC741EBC9264@sao.bre.co.uk>

Hello everyone,
I am trying to setup a model for PCM impregnated in the plasterboard that forms the inner surface of the walls. Though the help menu suggests that Designbuilder (Energyplus) can model PCMs, I'm unable to locate the Phase Change tab on the Materials data dialog box in order to enter the material enthalpy values. There are tabs for embodied carbon and green roofs but not for PCMs. Is there a way of activating this tab, or is this feature restricted to a particular license? I'm using DB version 3.

Hi Apeksha,

It is probably the version issue. I would recommend you upgrade it to v 3.2
released on May 22nd. (3.2.0.067). It has a lot of improvements and bug
fixes.

You would be able to see 'Phase Change Tab' to enter temperature
coefficient and points on Enthalpy curve.

It would look like attached image. Hope that helps.

Hi Jeremiah,

Would you mind sharing the resources people have shared with you, namely:
Tianzhen, thanks for the link.
Zheng, thanks for the recommended reading.
Matt, thanks for the link.

Thanks.

Diego
Doctoral Candidate
Harvard University

Diego,
I thought the responses that I got where posted to the list. For you and
others reference I post all of the responses I got:


   1. Try green building advisor


(My response to this) I read this
http://www.greenbuildingadvisor.com/blogs/dept/musings/energy-modeling-isn-t-very-accurate
a
while ago and did not think much of the way they talked badly about
modeling, and would prefer information from actual modelers, as I am using
this to support my actual modeling.. To me their article seems like it is
downplaying the benefits of modeling, written by someone who is reading
about modeling and writing an article rather than actively doing it.  It
seems like taking advice about how to design a building from a contractor,
they understand a bit, but really it is the architect and engineer that
know what they are doing, the contractor is just the one who does it, or
possibly more like getting news from a friend rather than the source.

I am looking for personal experience or peer reviewed scientific papers. If
anyone can help?


Thanks

2. Hi;

I've got a custom house that started as an  ASME design project.  It was
built in 1986.
We moved in January 1987.  I  have extensive records of energy used,
features active
in a particular month...... would you be interested in a technology
demonstrator in the
Washington DC metro area ??

 How about a Non Disclosure Agreement and a tele-meeting ??

JRR

(My response) I am not so interisted in this due to the age of the model
and complexity of the response..,  modeling has came a long way since 1897!
and I do not have much time for NDA's and tele-meetings... thanks anyway

4. Jeremiah,

That is an important topic among researchers and practitioners in the
simulation community for the last 20-30 years.

I made a presentation on this topic in a public EETD/LBNL seminar, A closer
look at the energy performance of buildings: simulated vs. measured. Slides
are available in PDF at
http://eetd.lbl.gov/news/events/2011/03/03/a-closer-look-at-the-energy-performance-of-buildings-simulated-vs-measured

I have some journal articles discussing related topics. You can find them
by using the Google Scholar.

Tianzhen

(my response) Tianzhen, thanks for the link. This is good work, well done
and very much what I was looking for.

6. Hi Jeremiah,

This might be too simplistic for what you're trying to do, and it's more
"hands on" as opposed to "peer-reviewed research" but for some quick checks
here's what I do:

* Compare to CBECS.  I use www.buildingbenchmarks.com.  It's a quick and
free website.  You enter basic info (zip code, square footage range,
primary building activity, and range of years the building was completed)
and it pulls the relevant info from CBECS for you.  It gives you a simple
breakdown of average annual electric and gas usage by activity (not
monthly, unfortunately).  So within a few seconds you can see how your
model compares.

* For existing buildings with utility bills available, I run a baseline
energy report per ASHRAE 14.  I use www.noesisenergy.com, another free
tool.  I enter in 12+ months of utility bills and it will generate
weather-normalized baseline reports, complete with the regression analysis
equations.  They use heating and cooling degree days from the closest
weather station to your site (based on the calculated balance point
temperatures for heating or cooling), plus utility billing days for each
month.  They do NOT factor in other variables like occupancy or
production.  You can compare actual, adjusted baseline, and typical
consumption for each month, for each utility.  So if you're using TMY2 or
TMY3 weather data in your model, you can see how it compares to the typical
monthly consumption from the baseline report.  I use this as a guide for
calibration.

I've had a discussion with William Ball at Noesis about using their tools
to better support energy modelers, and encouraged him to check out IBPSA.

Again, this might be missing the point of your request, and a little too
simplistic, so I didn't want to post it to the entire Bldg Sim listserv....

Best of luck in your efforts and please let me know what you find!

Matt Huffman, LEED AP
Manager, Energy Services
Murphy & Miller, Inc.

(My response)  Matt, these look like very useful tools, saving time going
through the database also providing useful data normalization. Thanks, I
did not know about this service and will put it to use in the future.

7. Dear Jeremiah,
I recently completed my dissertation on reusing today's design-phase
(compliance) energy models post-design, focusing on a building owner's
perspective.  For #2, "How does a proposed building typically stack up
against the utility bills?", I'd say it partially depends on the original
purpose of the model.  Was the modeler trying to predict utility bills, or
rather demonstrate compliance with a code/standard? For example, for
LEED-compliance models under older LEED (ASHRAE 90.1) protocol, modelers
made default assumptions regarding plug-loads.  This could lead to very
inaccurate models, especially for energy-intensive programs such as labs or
data centers.  I have some case studies, but they're essentially specific
to these older versions of LEED. I'm not sure if that's helpful to you.

For #3, "How accurate should an existing building model be to be considered
useful?", I'd say it depends on what you're trying to do with the model.
Test future retrofits? Benchmark the building? Detect subtle equipment
faults?  I have a couple case studies that involved such major building
faults that even relatively  poorly-calibrated models (per ASHRAE 14
definitions) helped detect the problems.  Again, I'm not sure if that's
relevant to you.

I'm happy to share my findings if they're relevant.  Please contact me if
this sounds like it might be helpful.
Best,
Holly

Subject: [Bldg-sim] adsorption and absorption devices: performance data
Message-ID: <CAB_-mWOZF5joYZu3B9R_KNy=pqiNny3=D5xqMogN+Vpn=rjarw@mail.gmail.com>

All,

we are looking for performance data for adsorption and absorption cooling
to be connected to a solar heating system (it is a high vacuum solar
collector which can still achieve temperatures of 180 degrees celsius in
Amsterdam).
What is important to evaluate the potential of solar cooling in this case,
are performance data as function of:

   - inlet temperature warm side (solar collector)
   - cold temperature (cooling)
   - flow rate


Any data are more than welcome!

Thanks,

leen

Hi  Jeremiah;

I think you misunderstood my offer of co-operation.

I did NOT offer you a FORTRAN IV model of the energy use of a building
dating from  1977 or 1980.  I had both at  one time.  The 1980 model simply
crushed a few thousand combinations of insulation, finance rates, etc.

I  DID offer Phase Change Energy Solutions and Vesture Corporation in
Ashboro NC a trial Proof of Concept installation site with an 
established energy
performance over 3 different heat pump installations, with and without 
active thermal
solar on the roof running, asymmetric soffits, among other features in 
Washington DC's
challenging 4000 degree day heating season and humid 2000 degree day 
cooling season..
That offer has expired.

"modeling has came a long way since 1897! "
Yes it has. that would make me,  with BSME at age 20 (didn't have as 
much content back then)
about  136 years old now.  On the factual side you will find evidence of 
extremely sophisticated
solar pond engineering in early   Precolumbian  South America in 
Ecuador??  Peru?? the Solar
ponds keep the growing vegetables relatively warm at night..........  
The argument centers on
how they came up with the design without Western math tools  - trig,  
calculus......

I do not have much time for NDA's and tele-meetings... thanks anyway
You never replied to me directly at all; Since my misunderstood offer.

If you don't have any time for   NDA's ,  where  does  that leave you in
Todays  (started March 15, 2013)  First-to-File  Patent Law Landscape ???
versus the old first to invent system..........

By the way  guys on the list     "Pre -- Columbian" as used here means 
before Christopher Columbus;
nothing else,  and it was not in the spelling checker.  (LOL)

OK  Back to Work It's  1130am early lunch is gone.........

bye

Sorry John R Ross III PE, your offer was very kind and I should have
responded to you directly. Your 1987 house was likely a pioneer and the
info it provided very valuable. Again, thanks anyways on the NDA and
tele-meeting. Got Ta watch out for what you sign these days.

Hi  Jeremiah;

I think you misunderstood my offer of co-operation.

I did NOT offer you a FORTRAN IV model of the energy use of a building
dating from  1977 or 1980.  I had both at  one time.  The 1980 model simply
crushed a few thousand combinations of insulation, finance rates, etc.

I  DID offer Phase Change Energy Solutions and Vesture Corporation in
Ashboro NC a trial Proof of Concept installation site with an=20
established energy
performance over 3 different heat pump installations, with and without=20
active thermal
solar on the roof running, asymmetric soffits, among other features in=20
Washington DC's
challenging 4000 degree day heating season and humid 2000 degree day=20
cooling season..
That offer has expired.

"modeling has came a long way since 1897! "
Yes it has. that would make me,  with BSME at age 20 (didn't have as=20
much content back then)
about  136 years old now.  On the factual side you will find evidence of=20
extremely sophisticated
solar pond engineering in early   Precolumbian  South America in=20
Ecuador??  Peru?? the Solar
ponds keep the growing vegetables relatively warm at night.......... =20
The argument centers on
how they came up with the design without Western math tools  - trig, =20
calculus......

I do not have much time for NDA's and tele-meetings... thanks anyway
You never replied to me directly at all; Since my misunderstood offer.

If you don't have any time for   NDA's ,  where  does  that leave you in
Todays  (started March 15, 2013)  First-to-File  Patent Law Landscape ???
versus the old first to invent system..........

By the way  guys on the list     "Pre -- Columbian" as used here means=20
before Christopher Columbus;
nothing else,  and it was not in the spelling checker.  (LOL)

OK  Back to Work It's  1130am early lunch is gone.........

bye

    Hi&nbsp; Jeremiah;<br>
    <br>
    I think you misunderstood my offer of co-operation.<br>
    <br>
    I did NOT offer you a FORTRAN IV model of the energy use of a
    building<br>
    dating from&nbsp; 1977 or 1980.&nbsp; I had both at&nbsp; one time.&nbs=
p; The 1980 model
    simply<br>
    crushed a few thousand combinations of insulation, finance rates,
    etc.<br>
    <br>
    I&nbsp; DID offer Phase Change Energy Solutions and Vesture Corporation
    in<br>
    Ashboro NC a trial Proof of Concept installation site with an
    established energy <br>
    performance over 3 different heat pump installations, with and
    without active thermal <br>
    solar on the roof running, asymmetric soffits, among other features
    in Washington DC's<br>
    challenging 4000 degree day heating season and humid 2000 degree day
    cooling season..<br>
    That offer has expired.<br>
    <br>
    "<font color=3D"#336666">modeling has came a long way since 1897! "</fo=
nt><br>
    Yes it has. that would make me,&nbsp; with BSME at age 20 (didn't have =
as
    much content back then)<br>
    about&nbsp; 136 years old now.&nbsp; On the factual side you will find
    evidence of extremely sophisticated<br>
    solar pond engineering in early &nbsp; Precolumbian&nbsp; South America=
 in&nbsp;
    Ecuador??&nbsp; Peru?? the Solar<br>
    ponds keep the growing vegetables relatively warm at
    night..........&nbsp; The argument centers on<br>
    how they came up with the design without Western math tools&nbsp; -&nbs=
p;
    trig,&nbsp; calculus......<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;<font color=3D"#336666"> I do not have much time for NDA's and
      tele-meetings... thanks anyway</font><br>
    You never replied to me directly at all; Since my misunderstood
    offer.<br>
    <br>
    If you don't have any time for&nbsp;&nbsp; NDA's ,&nbsp; where&nbsp; do=
es&nbsp; that leave
    you in <br>
    Todays&nbsp; (started March 15, 2013)&nbsp; First-to-File&nbsp; Patent =

            another free tool.&nbsp; I enter in 12+ months of utility bills
            and it will generate weather-normalized baseline reports,
            complete with the regression analysis equations.&nbsp; They use
            heating and cooling degree days from the closest weather
            station to your site (based on the calculated balance point
            temperatures for heating or cooling), plus utility billing
            days for each month.&nbsp; They do NOT factor in other variable=
s
            like occupancy or production.&nbsp; You can compare actual,
            adjusted baseline, and typical consumption for each month,
            for each utility.&nbsp; So if you're using TMY2 or TMY3 weather
            data in your model, you can see how it compares to the
            typical monthly consumption from the baseline report.&nbsp; I u=

          recently completed my dissertation on reusing today's
          design-phase (compliance) energy models post-design, focusing
          on a building owner's perspective. &nbsp;For #2, "How does a
          proposed building typically stack up against the utility
          bills?", I'd say it partially depends on the original purpose
          of the model. &nbsp;Was the modeler trying to predict utility
          bills, or rather demonstrate compliance with a code/standard?&nbs=
p;<span
            style=3D"font-size:10pt">For example, for LEED-compliance
            models under older LEED (ASHRAE 90.1) protocol, modelers
            made default assumptions regarding plug-loads. &nbsp;This could
            lead to very inaccurate models, especially for
            energy-intensive programs such as labs or data centers. &nbsp;I
            have some case studies, but they're essentially specific to
            these older versions of LEED. I'm not sure if that's helpful

                                        dissertation on reusing today's
                                        design-phase (compliance) energy
                                        models post-design, focusing on
                                        a building owner's perspective.
                                        &nbsp;For #2, "How does a proposed

                                        say it partially depends on the
                                        original purpose of the model.
                                        &nbsp;Was the modeler trying to
                                        predict utility bills, or rather
                                        demonstrate compliance with a

                                          to very inaccurate models,

Message-ID: <20130629123016.19282au886soe4aw@webmail.co2engineering.eu>

Dear all,

I am using eQUEST for an energy simulation for LEED and I have two questions:

- How do we model exhaust fans in eQUEST?
- For the baseline model, there is a requirement (for systems 5-8) for  
a supply air temperature reset of 5?F under minimum cooling load  
conditions per G3.1.3.12. How do you model this in eQUEST?

Thank you very much in advance.

Kind regards,

Eleni

Message-ID: <CAOfOiCEtObVV5Jo+YB5W6Kqo1EN-5nz69RAhNq40=ETD8Ww60Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Bldg-Sim Group,

I am working on variable refrigerant flow (VRF) system modeling using
EnergyPlus to understand energy savings compared to other conventional
systems.

For VRF modeling,  I utilized the example file
"VariableRefrigerantFlow_5Zone.idf". This example uses outdoor air mixer in
each VRF indoor unit for the supply air which goes through cooling and
heating coil to the zone inlet node.

But, a typical VRF system practice uses a separate DOAS system to reduce
cooling and heating load in the VRF side only recirculating return air to
be conditioned.

I am trying to add DOAS in the VRF modeling. The problem is that
HVACTemplate:DOAS (in EnergyPlus 7.2 or 8) does not support this.

Is there anybody who did VRF system modeling with adding DOAS?

Thank you!

Hi Xiwang,

 

The TRNSYS interface has been tested on Windows 32 bit but you should be
able to use the interface on Win64 bit, if you use the 64 bit version of the
BCVTB/TRNSYS types. 

You might want to contact  your TRNSYS distributor and see whether they
could provide you with TYPES compiled for Windows 64bit.

 

Best,

 

Thierry

We are pleased to announce the release of the Building Controls Virtual Test
Bed 1.3.

 

The following changes have been made compared to version 1.2:

 

* TRNSYS  has been added as a client program.

* The Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) for co-simulation import interface has
been added.

* The example files have been updated for EnergyPlus 8.0. 

 

The Building Controls Virtual Test Bed (BCVTB) is a freely available
open-source software environment that allows expert users to couple
different simulation programs for co-simulation, 

and to couple simulation programs with actual hardware. For example, the
BCVTB allows to simulate a building in EnergyPlus and the HVAC and control
system in Modelica, 

while exchanging data between the software as they simulate. The BCVTB is
based on the Ptolemy II software environment. 

The BCVTB allows expert users of simulation to expand the capabilities of
individual programs by linking them to other programs. 

Due to the different programs that may be involved in distributed
simulation, familiarity with configuring programs is essential.

 

Programs that are linked to the BCVTB are

 

* the EnergyPlus whole building energy simulation program,

* the Modelica modeling and simulation environment Dymola,

* the MATLAB and Simulink tools for scientific computing,

* the Radiance ray-tracing software for lighting analysis,

* the ESP-r integrated building energy modeling program,

* the TRNSYS system simulation program, 

* Functional Mock-up Units (FMU) for co-simulation,

* the BACnet stack, which allows exchanging data with BACnet compliant
Building Automation System (BAS),

* the analog/digital interface USB-1208LS from Measurement Computing
Corporation that can be connected to a USB port. 

 

In addition to using programs that are coupled to Ptolemy II, Ptolemy II's
graphical modeling environment can also be used to define models for control
systems, for physical devices, 

for communication systems or for post-processing and real-time
visualization.

*Presentation I: A demonstration of AECOSim Energy Simulator, the latest
GUI for EnergyPlus*
Drury B. Crawley - Director, Building Performance, Bentley Systems, Inc.

Description

AECOsim Energy Simulator (AES) is a full-featured, graphic interface for
building performance simulation built from the ground up based on the
latest EnergyPlus (v7.2) simulation engine. AES was initially released by
Bentley Systems in September 2011. This demonstration will first cover the
interface including the ribbon bar; tree for navigating spaces, walls,
windows, doors, ceilings, roofs, internal loads, HVAC components, and
zoning; BIM interface to visualize building models. How to create an AES
building model will also be shown: Conceptual Design (13 inputs, sketch the
building outline, select HVAC system); import 2-D CAD and trace the
building and spaces; import gbXML; or import graphics (bitmap, JPEG, GIF,
PDF) and trace spaces.

Then, the HVAC Designer will be shown along with 31 preconfigured HVAC and
SWH systems (preconfigured systems automatically create the all the
necessary EnergyPlus nodes, branches, and connections). The HVAC Designer
makes it easy to configure the more than 50 HVAC Designer components and
create or modify systems using a visual drag and drop system. Finally,
automated creation of baseline and budget buildings for ASHRAE 90.1 will be
shown as well as results from ASHRAE RTS/heat loss and EnergyPlus
simulation.

Sang Hoon,

The point of the HVACTemplate files is to demonstrate how the nodes and
branches are configured.
Using the DOAS and a zonal system template will show you how to configure a
system with a ventilation system and separate zonal cooling / heating
system.

I suggest using the HVACTemplates for DOAS and WaterToAirHeatPump to create
the node connections. Upon running, this will create a file '.expidf' which
is the HVACTemplates expanded out to full .idf.
You can rename this file to be extension .idf and edit it like a normal
.idf

Modify this renamed expanded HVACTemplate file, remove the zonal
WaterToAirHeatPump objects and replace them with the VRF terminals
following the example you are using.

Hope this helps,

Jason

Dear Anderson,

The example file (in EnergyPlus 8.0) is indeed what I was looking for.
This has AirLoopHVAC for DOAS and VRF system, which has separate coils
assigned for each system controlling temperature and humidity.
Great!

Thank you!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modeling PTAC system with economizer (E+)
Message-ID: <CAETHmJ6NjaD+tJTD00MO55wDDxL0DMS1tA3269fVEkoBPnOWHQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, all,

I'm trying to model a PTAC system with economizer within E+ environment.

The specification of the system is:

The OA economizer here is to provide "free" cooling during times of cool
ambient conditions. The amount of outside air taken into the building will
vary between the design percentage and the maximum percentage. And
the design percentage of OA of the system is not defined as related to
occupancy or floor area but 25% of total supply air.

I read the I/O reference about Controller:OutdoorAir, but it seems:

"If all the limits are satisfied, the outdoor air controller does the
following for cycling fan systems: the outdoor air flow rate is set to the
maximum when the fan cycles on. If the limits are not satisfied, the
outdoor air flow rate is at the minimum when the fan cycles on."

The problem is it's either minimum or maximum instead of modulating
according to outdoor and return air condition?

Does anyone have suggestions on this? Help greatly appreciated.

Do I have to go to EMS for this control scheme?

Best,

Qinpeng

Subject: [Bldg-sim] compiling Inverse Modeling Toolkit
Message-ID: <51B10D65.1090406@gmail.com>

Folks

I want to compile the fortran code that comes with the Inverse Modeling 
Toolkit report (ASHRAE RP-1050). The downloaded ZIP file contains 
pre-compiled IMT.EXE for MS-Windows. I want to compile it in Linux using 
gfortran.

A quick and dirty attempt to compile produce the following result:

*******************
$ gfortran IMT.F90
/tmp/ccVxJVqG.o: In function `process_cmd_line.1953':
IMT.F90:(.text+0x22ea0): undefined reference to `command_line_'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
*******************

I presume that it requires the libraries to be able to compile it.

Is there anybody who has done this before? Any pointers on how to fix this?

Thanks

Ery

Qinpeng,
Normal PTAC equipment does not ever have an economizer, so the E+ object does not allow it.
If you really need to model a DX cooling system with economizer, construct an E+ air loop with equivalent components for the fan, DX coil, supplemental heat, etc.

Message-ID: <770DA51B8CC79343A32830010D6E379A10BE8C70@PC3XMB-0002L.LEC-ADMIN.dmu.ac.uk>

Dear Colleagues,

We have finished beta-testing of jEPlus V1.4; it is now released. As usual, we didn't receive much bug reports from users, but we managed to find some on our own - it wasn't that difficult, actually ;-) Should you find any issues or need more functions, please feel free to post them on the discussion page: http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jeplus/wiki/doku.php?id=discussion_main.

Apart from bug fixes, the main difference between 1.4 Beta and v1.4 is the command-line interface. It has been completely rewritten, to give script users more control over how the simulation jobs to be executed, without the need for opening GUI. Here is an example:

java -jar jEPlus.jar -job example_E+v8.0/HVACTemplate-5ZoneFanCoil.jep -lhs 20 -seed 1234567 -cfg jeplus_v80.cfg -local 2 -output ../CmdLineTests/output/

This command will run a Latin Hypercube sample of 20 jobs, of the given project, with a specified random seed, using E+ V8, on two processor cores, and write all outputs to the given folder. jEPlus will execute the jobs and then exit quietly, leaving the usual output tables in the given folder. Using the command-line options, it is very easy to couple it with your own scripts, e.g. in Matlab, Python and so on. More information can be found in the User's Manual: http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jeplus/wiki/doku.php?id=docs:manual_1_4.

Best regards,

Yi

Fellow Building Simulationists,

I know you've already seen several emails about our proposal to improve how
people get answers to their simulation related questions. If you haven't,
here is a link to the site:

http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/45232/building-energy-modeling

Thanks so much to those of you who have already joined and followed the
effort. We now have more than 200 followers (which is more than most of
these sites can claim)!

BUT it's not only the number of followers that will help us realize our
goal. We need everyone to VOTE! Voting on questions is how we prove to the
people hosting the site that our community has a well defined topic and
scope to warrant a site specifically for questions about "Building
Performance Simulation & Analysis".

We are so close to moving on to our next phase. Even if a handful of people
who have already signed up return to the site to use their allotted 5
votes, we can probably reach our goal of 40 questions with 10 or more votes
within a matter of days.

So please, take just a few minutes to go to the site and vote on some
questions that do not yet have 10 votes and help us improve the support for
our community!

http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/45232/building-energy-modeling

If you have any questions or problems navigating the site, don't hesitate
to send me an email.

Thank you!

Message-ID: <1B23446CBF250648A2FC775DE3FE7E800FF03F01@OC11expo28.exchange.mit.edu>

Dear colleagues:

This is a reminder that the early bird registration for DIVA DAY 2013, which will be held on July 15th in New York, ends this Friday. To register please go here<http://www.solemma.net/DIVA-for-Rhino/Diva-Day-Early-Registration.php>.  A current agenda for the day can be accessed here<http://diva4rhino.com/diva-day-2013/agenda>. Some of you might also/instead be interested in a three day Executive Education Program<http://execed.gsd.harvard.edu/programs/daylighting-buildings-1> on Daylighting Buildings at Harvard on July 8-10.

Who should attend which event?

DIVA DAY is most suited for two different groups: Practitioners or educators who are either are already familiar with daylighting and energy analysis and who would like to actively participate in a discussion of how to apply them in practice or to teach them at the university level. If you fall into this category you will get a lot of new ideas that you can directly apply. Alternatively, you may be a practitioner or educator who considers adding daylighting and energy analysis to your skill set but you first want to see whether this is worth your time. The day provides good networking opportunities for both groups.

The Executive Education Program is effectively a compressed three day version of the MIT Daylighting Class. We will be going through the theory and practice of conducting advanced daylight simulations and glare analysis using Radiance/Daysim and E+ as well as HDR photography. On days one and two we will go back and forth between presentations and hands on exercises. On day three participants will work on a project of their own with support provided by the instructors. If you take this class, you will learn how to actually do simulations or what pressing certain buttons actually means.

We scheduled the two events back to back so that you can first learn the theory and then participate in the discussion, all in one week.

All the best,

Christoph

I'm more agnostic about this. ASHRAE Climate Zone 1 (Miami) is very hot as well as humid.  
Hopefully, there was some analysis done showing that economizers are not cost-effective 
under such climate regimes.

Chris,
More warm weather  = less available cooling from outdoor air = less justification for spending money to install economizer controls.
p.s., You must provide minimum outdoor air for ventilation, but need not also cool with outdoor air

Is it just me, or is does it seem terrifically wasteful that a climate 1 building doesn't require an economiser? Or am I missing something?

Hi Joe,

1a I understand. But we are looking at a 1b location (Hot/ Dry). Surely the
best approach would be economiser with DB control?

Curiously, in my copy (90.1 2007) economisers are not required in *1b
*(table G3.1.2.6A).
However, the following table (G3.1.2.6B) denotes that economiser high limit
shutoff should be 75degF for *1b*.

Am I missing something fundamental about the physics of non-extant
economisers?

Chris

Thanks Jim,

So your understanding is that a mixing box still exists, but the control
that varies outdoor air rate doesn't exist. It is in effect a fixed outdoor
air rate.

Many thanks

Great. A minor conundrum remains, quoting:

1b (table G3.1.2.6A).

Who knows?
However, and until corrected by another who knows better, I would follow the instruction to leave out an economizer in Climate Zone 1b because it seems consistent with the pattern for warmer climates.  My guess is that a zealous engineer mistakenly populated the table (6B) for that zone.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] how to model pool dehumidification in ECB budget system
Message-ID: <4016B1EA0C8DA84D88D1E20A29CD3E79E114DEB4BD@TOR-SVR-EX5.mcw.com>

Hello
I am looking for helps on how to model pool dehumidification in ASHRAE 90.1 ECB.
The proposed design of pool dehumidification is:  water cooled cooling (ground source), hot water heating
Using Figure 11.4.3, it would be system 7 (four pipe fan coil)
Is it a right approach? Or shall I model an identical system (DOT) system in budget model, which I consider the system is beyond figure 11.4.3 (applying item 11.4.3 (a))
Thanks,
Xiangjin

Dear bldg sim,

I am looking for papers that elaborate on the concept of modeling, and how
it correlates to actual utility data to share with people within my company.

The questions keeps popping up, eg..

   1. How does a baseline building compare to an average building?
   2. How does a proposed building typically stack up against the utility
   bills once the building is built?
   3. How accurate an existing building model should be to be considered
   useful, and how accurate is typically possible?
   4. For an experimental setup what would be considered to be close enough
   to be considered a "validated" model?

My understanding is that modeling is to show relationships between average
a baseline of a chosen vintage and that of a proposed design in terms of
relative percentages.  For existing buildings I think that useful is within
20% and typically possible is 10%. Then for a validation model, the most
important factor is similar curves and close totals.

If anyone has any recommended papers, or personal experience it would be
appreciated.

Kind regards

Help Wanted - Senior Building Energy Modeler

Big Ladder Software is looking to hire a senior building energy modeler to
help us expand the services and software that we offer.

*About Big Ladder Software*

Big Ladder is a Denver-based company dedicated to providing services and
software *for energy modelers*. The company name reflects our mission to
"help our clients reach new heights". Founded in 2009, we are a team of
engineers and computer programmers who are passionate about developing
innovative open-source software tools for the modeling of buildings,
transportation, communities, and all areas of energy efficiency and
renewables. We primarily use the EnergyPlus simulation engine to perform
whole-building energy analyses. We also offer training workshops,
commercial support, and custom software development services for EnergyPlus.

*Job Description*

This job is for a full-time position at our Denver location. A flexible
remote-working arrangement may be possible in some cases. If hired,
responsibilities would include:

- performing building energy analyses using EnergyPlus
- providing support for our clients using EnergyPlus and our software tools
- teaching training workshops on EnergyPlus and our software tools
- developing training materials and tutorials
- influencing the direction of new software tools for energy modeling
- authoring white papers, technical papers, and blog posts on energy
modeling topics
- growing and leading a small team of energy modelers
- developing business opportunities for new work

*Job Requirements*

To be considered for the job, you should be able to demonstrate the
following minimum requirements:

- deep expertise in using one of the main energy modeling engines
(EnergyPlus*, eQUEST/DOE-2, TRNSYS, IES-VE, ESP-r, TRACE)
- deep knowledge and understanding of building science and HVAC systems
- excellent people skills
- excellent writing skills
- excellent presentation skills
- ability to work independently

**Previous experience with EnergyPlus would be a bonus, but not a
requirement. As needed, we would train you fully on EnergyPlus and our
software tools.*

Finally, this might be the right job for you, if you agree with most of the
following statements:

- you find yourself pushing the limits of your energy modeling tools on a
daily basis, and it frustrates you to no end
- you have worked at a mechanical or architectural engineering firm and
have performed or been heavily exposed to design work
- you considered becoming a teacher or a professor at some point in your
life
- you have an entrepreneurial streak that has gone untapped for too long
- you have been looking for an excuse to learn (and become insanely good
at) EnergyPlus
- you think there MUST be better ways to do software for building energy
modeling

Jeremiah,

I think you'll find a room full of experts and lots of advice on this at the upcoming SPC 209 Meeting at ASHRAE in Denver. I've enclosed a copy of the agenda, as well as the Chair's email, Jason Glazer. Part of the work for 209 is assembling the list you are looking for.

Also, you'll find useful information in the new Guideline 14, and in the Energy Management Handbook, by Doty and Turner. www.ibpsa.org<http://www.ibpsa.org> and the www.esl.tamu.edu<http://www.esl.tamu.edu> are also good places to check as well.

Jeremiah,

That is an important topic among researchers and practitioners in the
simulation community for the last 20-30 years.

I made a presentation on this topic in a public EETD/LBNL seminar, A closer
look at the energy performance of buildings: simulated vs. measured. Slides
are available in PDF at
http://eetd.lbl.gov/news/events/2011/03/03/a-closer-look-at-the-energy-performance-of-buildings-simulated-vs-measured

I have some journal articles discussing related topics. You can find them
by using the Google Scholar.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Simergy - Does anyone uses this software
Message-ID: <000c01ce6cfc$23c1b9a0$6b452ce0$@blcnavitas.pt>

Hello,

 

I am trying to initiate on Simergy and it is being a very difficult task (I
am use to work with HAP and DesignBulider). They don't answer to my
questions, the help guide is basic and the tutorials can't help me either. 

 

I would like to know if someone in this group works with this Software. 

 

I am trying to create a building with a custom zone configuration. Does
anyone know how to create those zones? Is it necessary to draw a custom
space and draw the internal walls exactly in the same space? Or is there a
way of doing just one thing? For example, create the internal zones just by
drawing the internal walls. 

 

Thank you, in advance.

 

Best Regards,

Guilherme V. Martins

Senior Energy Modeller, Atlanta, GA

The Company: Integrated Environmental Solutions Limited (IES) develops the <Virtual Environment> (<VE>), the world leading building simulation software which enables clients to design high quality and innovative buildings whilst minimising the impact on the environment. The <VE> is the only tool which allows building designers to simulate the full performance of their design and, as the industry rises to meet the challenge of sustainable development, the demand for our products is growing rapidly. Last year, IES acquired BVM Engineering - a team of well-respected and experienced engineers and LEED Accredited Professionals (APs) operating from Atlanta, Georgia. This strong alliance has led to further expansion of our LEED consulting services and, as a result, we require a Senior Energy Modeller to join the Atlanta team.

  *   Review, analyze, and provide technical advice on sustainable design and/or LEED optimization;
  *   Utilize software models to evaluate elements of building performance. Work with detailed diagrams, plans, drawings, specifications, and sequences;
  *   Provide technical support to clients, and serve as a technical resource to staff;
  *   Assist with preparing reports to advise clients and architects on energy use and conservation for buildings with the goal of minimizing environmental impact;
  *   Attend project groups and technical meetings. Collect and analyze data for reports and develop models. Assist as required to calculate costs based on the collected data.
  *   Maintain currency of expertise by staying abreast of new and developing industry issues and trends

  *   Experience with a variety of high-performance building projects, including LEED projects
  *   Ability to read, understand, and interpret design and construction documents, including building floor plans, mechanical plans and schedules, sections, construction specifications, shop drawings, and operating sequences
  *   Strong communicator and self-starter with an interest in diverse experiences
  *   Strong computer skills, including proficiency in MS Office suite and LEED Online

Desirable skills:


*         Master's degree in a related field

*         Experience of using building simulation software will be a distinct advantage, ideally the IES <VE> software but full training will be given to the right candidates.

*         Detailed technical understanding of and experience with ASHRAE 62.1, ASHRAE 55, and IPMVP Vol. III

The Rewards: We offer the chance to work for a dynamic company in an exciting and supportive working environment; we will reward you with a competitive salary; health, dental, vision and life insurance; a 401k plan, but above all, the opportunity to develop your career in a rapidly growing international organization with great potential.

Message-ID: <ECDF361A89E5FA479BE7E64C658B52051C0BE898@SANDBINC4.sbi.smithboucher.com>

Hi everyone,

Found this short article an interesting read.  Provides an overview of how advanced lighting controls will work their way into our energy models under LEED v4.  "Advanced lighting controls" include manual/programmed/daylight dimming, multi-level switching, and task-ambient workstation lighting with dimming/sensors.

http://www.ies.org/lda/HotTopics/LED/15.cfm

The response provided by USGBC for this article appears to technically conflict with the usual language in Appendix G Table 3.1, section 6 (or at least my current copy - there may be current/future addenda I'm missing), but it sounds as though we'll be permitted to document and work additional LPD allowances into the baseline lighting power densities.

I expect mindful LEED v4 modelers of the future may be well-advised to work" potential impact of advanced lighting controls" into their DD-stage LEED assessments, to put the lighting designers on notice at an early enough juncture to realize the benefits...

Regards,

~Nick

Hello everyone,
I am trying to setup a model for PCM impregnated in the plasterboard that forms the inner surface of the walls. Though the help menu suggests that Designbuilder (Energyplus) can model PCMs, I'm unable to locate the Phase Change tab on the Materials data dialog box in order to enter the material enthalpy values. There are tabs for embodied carbon and green roofs but not for PCMs. Is there a way of activating this tab, or is this feature restricted to a particular license? I'm using DB version 3.

Hi Apeksha,

It is probably the version issue. I would recommend you upgrade it to v 3.2
released on May 22nd. (3.2.0.067). It has a lot of improvements and bug
fixes.

You would be able to see 'Phase Change Tab' to enter temperature
coefficient and points on Enthalpy curve.

It would look like attached image. Hope that helps.

Hi Jeremiah,

Would you mind sharing the resources people have shared with you, namely:
Tianzhen, thanks for the link.
Zheng, thanks for the recommended reading.
Matt, thanks for the link.

Thanks.

Diego,
I thought the responses that I got where posted to the list. For you and
others reference I post all of the responses I got:


   1. Try green building advisor


(My response to this) I read this
http://www.greenbuildingadvisor.com/blogs/dept/musings/energy-modeling-isn-t-very-accurate
a
while ago and did not think much of the way they talked badly about
modeling, and would prefer information from actual modelers, as I am using
this to support my actual modeling.. To me their article seems like it is
downplaying the benefits of modeling, written by someone who is reading
about modeling and writing an article rather than actively doing it.  It
seems like taking advice about how to design a building from a contractor,
they understand a bit, but really it is the architect and engineer that
know what they are doing, the contractor is just the one who does it, or
possibly more like getting news from a friend rather than the source.

I am looking for personal experience or peer reviewed scientific papers. If
anyone can help?


Thanks

2. Hi;

I've got a custom house that started as an  ASME design project.  It was
built in 1986.
We moved in January 1987.  I  have extensive records of energy used,
features active
in a particular month...... would you be interested in a technology
demonstrator in the
Washington DC metro area ??

 How about a Non Disclosure Agreement and a tele-meeting ??

JRR

(My response) I am not so interisted in this due to the age of the model
and complexity of the response..,  modeling has came a long way since 1897!
and I do not have much time for NDA's and tele-meetings... thanks anyway

the agenda, as well as the Chair?s email, Jason Glazer. Part of the work
for 209 is assembling the list you are looking for.*

4. Jeremiah,

That is an important topic among researchers and practitioners in the
simulation community for the last 20-30 years.

I made a presentation on this topic in a public EETD/LBNL seminar, A closer
look at the energy performance of buildings: simulated vs. measured. Slides
are available in PDF at
http://eetd.lbl.gov/news/events/2011/03/03/a-closer-look-at-the-energy-performance-of-buildings-simulated-vs-measured

I have some journal articles discussing related topics. You can find them
by using the Google Scholar.

(my response) Tianzhen, thanks for the link. This is good work, well done
and very much what I was looking for.

6. Hi Jeremiah,

This might be too simplistic for what you're trying to do, and it's more
"hands on" as opposed to "peer-reviewed research" but for some quick checks
here's what I do:

* Compare to CBECS.  I use www.buildingbenchmarks.com.  It's a quick and
free website.  You enter basic info (zip code, square footage range,
primary building activity, and range of years the building was completed)
and it pulls the relevant info from CBECS for you.  It gives you a simple
breakdown of average annual electric and gas usage by activity (not
monthly, unfortunately).  So within a few seconds you can see how your
model compares.

* For existing buildings with utility bills available, I run a baseline
energy report per ASHRAE 14.  I use www.noesisenergy.com, another free
tool.  I enter in 12+ months of utility bills and it will generate
weather-normalized baseline reports, complete with the regression analysis
equations.  They use heating and cooling degree days from the closest
weather station to your site (based on the calculated balance point
temperatures for heating or cooling), plus utility billing days for each
month.  They do NOT factor in other variables like occupancy or
production.  You can compare actual, adjusted baseline, and typical
consumption for each month, for each utility.  So if you're using TMY2 or
TMY3 weather data in your model, you can see how it compares to the typical
monthly consumption from the baseline report.  I use this as a guide for
calibration.

I've had a discussion with William Ball at Noesis about using their tools
to better support energy modelers, and encouraged him to check out IBPSA.

Again, this might be missing the point of your request, and a little too
simplistic, so I didn't want to post it to the entire Bldg Sim listserv....

Best of luck in your efforts and please let me know what you find!

(My response)  Matt, these look like very useful tools, saving time going
through the database also providing useful data normalization. Thanks, I
did not know about this service and will put it to use in the future.

7. Dear Jeremiah,
I recently completed my dissertation on reusing today's design-phase
(compliance) energy models post-design, focusing on a building owner's
perspective.  For #2, "How does a proposed building typically stack up
against the utility bills?", I'd say it partially depends on the original
purpose of the model.  Was the modeler trying to predict utility bills, or
rather demonstrate compliance with a code/standard? For example, for
LEED-compliance models under older LEED (ASHRAE 90.1) protocol, modelers
made default assumptions regarding plug-loads.  This could lead to very
inaccurate models, especially for energy-intensive programs such as labs or
data centers.  I have some case studies, but they're essentially specific
to these older versions of LEED. I'm not sure if that's helpful to you.

For #3, "How accurate should an existing building model be to be considered
useful?", I'd say it depends on what you're trying to do with the model.
Test future retrofits? Benchmark the building? Detect subtle equipment
faults?  I have a couple case studies that involved such major building
faults that even relatively  poorly-calibrated models (per ASHRAE 14
definitions) helped detect the problems.  Again, I'm not sure if that's
relevant to you.

I'm happy to share my findings if they're relevant.  Please contact me if
this sounds like it might be helpful.
Best,
Holly

Message-ID: <CAB_-mWOZF5joYZu3B9R_KNy=pqiNny3=D5xqMogN+Vpn=rjarw@mail.gmail.com>

All,

we are looking for performance data for adsorption and absorption cooling
to be connected to a solar heating system (it is a high vacuum solar
collector which can still achieve temperatures of 180 degrees celsius in
Amsterdam).
What is important to evaluate the potential of solar cooling in this case,
are performance data as function of:

   - inlet temperature warm side (solar collector)
   - cold temperature (cooling)
   - flow rate


Any data are more than welcome!

Thanks,

leen

Hi  Jeremiah;

I think you misunderstood my offer of co-operation.

I did NOT offer you a FORTRAN IV model of the energy use of a building
dating from  1977 or 1980.  I had both at  one time.  The 1980 model simply
crushed a few thousand combinations of insulation, finance rates, etc.

I  DID offer Phase Change Energy Solutions and Vesture Corporation in
Ashboro NC a trial Proof of Concept installation site with an 
established energy
performance over 3 different heat pump installations, with and without 
active thermal
solar on the roof running, asymmetric soffits, among other features in 
Washington DC's
challenging 4000 degree day heating season and humid 2000 degree day 
cooling season..
That offer has expired.

"modeling has came a long way since 1897! "
Yes it has. that would make me,  with BSME at age 20 (didn't have as 
much content back then)
about  136 years old now.  On the factual side you will find evidence of 
extremely sophisticated
solar pond engineering in early   Precolumbian  South America in 
Ecuador??  Peru?? the Solar
ponds keep the growing vegetables relatively warm at night..........  
The argument centers on
how they came up with the design without Western math tools  - trig,  
calculus......

I do not have much time for NDA's and tele-meetings... thanks anyway
You never replied to me directly at all; Since my misunderstood offer.

If you don't have any time for   NDA's ,  where  does  that leave you in
Todays  (started March 15, 2013)  First-to-File  Patent Law Landscape ???
versus the old first to invent system..........

By the way  guys on the list     "Pre -- Columbian" as used here means 
before Christopher Columbus;
nothing else,  and it was not in the spelling checker.  (LOL)

OK  Back to Work It's  1130am early lunch is gone.........

bye

Sorry John R Ross III PE, your offer was very kind and I should have
responded to you directly. Your 1987 house was likely a pioneer and the
info it provided very valuable. Again, thanks anyways on the NDA and
tele-meeting. Got Ta watch out for what you sign these days.

Hi  Jeremiah;

I think you misunderstood my offer of co-operation.

I did NOT offer you a FORTRAN IV model of the energy use of a building
dating from  1977 or 1980.  I had both at  one time.  The 1980 model simply
crushed a few thousand combinations of insulation, finance rates, etc.

I  DID offer Phase Change Energy Solutions and Vesture Corporation in
Ashboro NC a trial Proof of Concept installation site with an=20
established energy
performance over 3 different heat pump installations, with and without=20
active thermal
solar on the roof running, asymmetric soffits, among other features in=20
Washington DC's
challenging 4000 degree day heating season and humid 2000 degree day=20
cooling season..
That offer has expired.

"modeling has came a long way since 1897! "
Yes it has. that would make me,  with BSME at age 20 (didn't have as=20
much content back then)
about  136 years old now.  On the factual side you will find evidence of=20
extremely sophisticated
solar pond engineering in early   Precolumbian  South America in=20
Ecuador??  Peru?? the Solar
ponds keep the growing vegetables relatively warm at night.......... =20
The argument centers on
how they came up with the design without Western math tools  - trig, =20
calculus......

I do not have much time for NDA's and tele-meetings... thanks anyway
You never replied to me directly at all; Since my misunderstood offer.

If you don't have any time for   NDA's ,  where  does  that leave you in
Todays  (started March 15, 2013)  First-to-File  Patent Law Landscape ???
versus the old first to invent system..........

By the way  guys on the list     "Pre -- Columbian" as used here means=20
before Christopher Columbus;
nothing else,  and it was not in the spelling checker.  (LOL)

OK  Back to Work It's  1130am early lunch is gone.........

bye

    Hi&nbsp; Jeremiah;<br>
    <br>
    I think you misunderstood my offer of co-operation.<br>
    <br>
    I did NOT offer you a FORTRAN IV model of the energy use of a
    building<br>
    dating from&nbsp; 1977 or 1980.&nbsp; I had both at&nbsp; one time.&nbs=
p; The 1980 model
    simply<br>
    crushed a few thousand combinations of insulation, finance rates,
    etc.<br>
    <br>
    I&nbsp; DID offer Phase Change Energy Solutions and Vesture Corporation
    in<br>
    Ashboro NC a trial Proof of Concept installation site with an
    established energy <br>
    performance over 3 different heat pump installations, with and
    without active thermal <br>
    solar on the roof running, asymmetric soffits, among other features
    in Washington DC's<br>
    challenging 4000 degree day heating season and humid 2000 degree day
    cooling season..<br>
    That offer has expired.<br>
    <br>
    "<font color=3D"#336666">modeling has came a long way since 1897! "</fo=
nt><br>
    Yes it has. that would make me,&nbsp; with BSME at age 20 (didn't have =
as
    much content back then)<br>
    about&nbsp; 136 years old now.&nbsp; On the factual side you will find
    evidence of extremely sophisticated<br>
    solar pond engineering in early &nbsp; Precolumbian&nbsp; South America=
 in&nbsp;
    Ecuador??&nbsp; Peru?? the Solar<br>
    ponds keep the growing vegetables relatively warm at
    night..........&nbsp; The argument centers on<br>
    how they came up with the design without Western math tools&nbsp; -&nbs=
p;
    trig,&nbsp; calculus......<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;<font color=3D"#336666"> I do not have much time for NDA's and
      tele-meetings... thanks anyway</font><br>
    You never replied to me directly at all; Since my misunderstood
    offer.<br>
    <br>
    If you don't have any time for&nbsp;&nbsp; NDA's ,&nbsp; where&nbsp; do=
es&nbsp; that leave
    you in <br>

          proposed building typically stack up against the utility
          bills?", I'd say it partially depends on the original purpose
          of the model. &nbsp;Was the modeler trying to predict utility

            lead to very inaccurate models, especially for
            energy-intensive programs such as labs or data centers. &nbsp;I

                                      <div>I recently completed my
                                        dissertation on reusing today's
                                        design-phase (compliance) energy
                                        models post-design, focusing on
                                        a building owner's perspective.
                                        &nbsp;For #2, "How does a proposed
                                        building typically stack up
                                        against the utility bills?", I'd
                                        say it partially depends on the
                                        original purpose of the model.
                                        &nbsp;Was the modeler trying to
                                        predict utility bills, or rather
                                        demonstrate compliance with a

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Exhaust fans
Message-ID: <20130629123016.19282au886soe4aw@webmail.co2engineering.eu>

Dear all,

I am using eQUEST for an energy simulation for LEED and I have two questions:

- How do we model exhaust fans in eQUEST?
- For the baseline model, there is a requirement (for systems 5-8) for  
a supply air temperature reset of 5?F under minimum cooling load  
conditions per G3.1.3.12. How do you model this in eQUEST?

Thank you very much in advance.

Kind regards,

Eleni
