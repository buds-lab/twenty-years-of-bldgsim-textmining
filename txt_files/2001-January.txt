Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200101100215.AA151987pd80000008343@gard.com>

Hello

I am using Power DOE and have thus far been using online documentation and 
learning by trying. However, I cannot figure out how to access the hourly 
results (hourly end use loads, etc).   I need the full 8760 of data for the 
blocks I defined. I believe this is the *.sin file for the project, but it 
is not formatted to read, as the *.sim file is.  I would also like to have 
the *.srp file in readable format, but have not been able to do this 
either.  Of course I can look at the reports in the Review Results module 
but I want the data in an Excel importable format

I am sure there is an easy fix for this but I have been unable to figure it 
out.

Advice greatly appreciated, thank you thank you in advance

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Modeling a manufacturing environment
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200101101504.AA045654pd80000008539@gard.com>

We are about to undertake a project where the building is, for the most
part, an enclosure for the manufacturing of beer.  The owners are very
interested in alternative energy and other innovative ways of reducing
environmental impact.

What I have in mind is to simulate the brewing process using a business
simulation program that has the capability of modeling process piping and
heat in and out of the manufacturing process.  This would give a handle on
the frequency and quantity of heat required to process the beer.  Along with
the quantity of waste product.  Then, I would envision building a second
model of the building and the environmental interface.  From this we would
be able to explore heat source options, including biopower, industrial solar
and other options, to understand their practical or economic viability to
our needs.

My question is does anyone have experience in working on similar, or
conceptually a process like I have outlined.  And, if you would have
interest in collaborating on such an undertaking.  Also, suggestions would
be greatly appreciated.

Fred, Bldg-Sim List Members

We performed a similar study about a year ago on a manufacturing plant in 
Brazil that had a large industrial waste heat supply and a progressive 
management team that wanted to "green" the plant.  They wanted to study 
solar absorption cooling, solar power generation, process heat options and 
domestic hot water schemes that would save energy (and money) while adding 
cooling to a previously unconditioned facility.  After studying several 
simulation programs, we decided to use the TRNSYS software for the project 
for several reasons.  First and foremost is that we have lots of experience 
with the software.  Secondly, we found that its tremendous flexibility and 
modularity made it ideal for a project like this - one that will be built 
in stages.  The ability to add new component models to the software package 
proved extremely beneficial as we had to write several models for processes 
in the plant that were not part of the package.  We found that other 
monolithic simulation packages lacked the flexibility that was needed to 
study all the different configurations and options that the client wished 
to study.  Finally, the software lets an expert create a finished 
simulation package that we could distribute to the client so that they 
themselves could study the system, optimize the design, and view the 
projected results without the cost of having us do all the leg-work.

I have attached a zip file (1 bitmap), containing one of the early TRNSYS 
representations of this system, to this e-mail so you can get an idea of 
the system we were tasked to study.

If you have any questions about that project, or would like to discuss your 
new project - I can be reached at (608) 274-2577.

With kindest regards,

Jeff Thornton

Hyeun Moon,

The BLDG-SIM mailing list is kind of a user group for all 
building simulation programs.  You are welcome to ask 
specific questions about EnergyPlus or any other building 
simulation program you want on the BLDG-SIM mailing list.   
In addition, EnergyPlus also has a support e-mail address 
that you can send questions:

 energyplus-support at gard.com

As far as an easy way to learn EnergyPlus, the beta version 
that you probably downloaded included all the documentation 
on the program that exists.

We are interested in finding someone that can perform an energy audit on an
existing building that has applied our white roofing membrane. We wish to
compare the cost differential between their old black roof and our white
roof. We want to use a project that has had our roof on for a period of at
least two years. We are also interested in creating software that our
contractors could utilize to preform the same type of anaylisis for
potential clients. The software should be user friendly wlith simple
peramiters able to perform a cost savings and project a life cycle cost
anaylisis.
Thankyou
Robert

Does anyone know the best way to model a waterside economizer in PowerDOE?
The building uses economizing capacity when the condenser water temperature
is approximately 70?F or less.  I would appreciate any help.  Thanks.

The lack of a WS CW-to-CHW economizer component in DOE2.2/PD is one of the
reasons I'm still using DOE2.1.

When I was trying to use 2.2, I tried the following to mimic a flatplate
tower-CHW HX in parallel with chillers:
    I created a virtual chiller with .05 kW/ton.
    I think I also created a separate CW loop with a lower CW setpoint.
    To dispatch this capacity, I used some kind of load assigment, or loop
control statements or something.

As I recall, I experienced crashes while DOESIM was running, because of curves
that couldn't be evaluated, or divide by zero, or... This experience was awhile
ago.

One could also create "virtual" chiller curves incorporating greatly reduced
kW/ton at low CW temps, but the extreme non-linearity might be hard to handle.

None of this seems very satisfactory for modeling a common component of
efficient HVAC systems in the latest version of a widely-used advanced hourly
simulation program.

Maybe JJH would weigh in with a suggestion.

Do you have separate CW coils on the OA, or very, very high CHW delta Ts?

All,

Just a reminder that a new GPC is forming to help establish guidelines
for
using XML technology within our industry.  From e-commerce, to online
building performance and monitoring, the intent of this committee will
be to
establish a common vocabulary designed to automate our industry
processes
and performance.  This isn't a rocket science, as the technology to
accomplish this already exists.  However, we need to establish common
vocabularies to describe our commodities and data.  Much of which
already
exists in your product catalogs.

Please attend our inaugural meeting and assist in forming the exact
scope of
this committee as well as the committee itself. {To be held at the
upcoming ASHRAE
meeting in Atlanta}.

Greetings --

Does anyone have good source(s) for typical operating condition assumptions 
for various building occupancies?

We're assembling a library that includes setpoints, lighting power density, 
occupant density, plug loads, etc plus associated schedules.  The data will 
be used for load (sizing) calcs, so we're looking for representative design 
values.  However, info for energy calcs would also be helpful.

Thanks for any leads.

One source for this type of information is from LBNL in a 
report called "Commercial Heating and Cooling Loads 
Component Analysis" by Joe Huang and Ellen Franconi (LBL-
37208).  Another is the ASHRAE Standard 90.1-1989 Users 
Manual Table 13-B, I don't know if this one is available 
anymore since they are publishing the 1999 version now.

Chip:

Determining appropriate heat gain from office desktop computers, printers, etc.
has always been a gray area for HVAC designers.  Coming up with real world
information such as equipment nameplate power rating vs. actual wattage
consumed and suitable diversity factors have been a challenge for load
calculations.

However, an excellent article titled "Heat Gain from Office Equipment" by
Wilkins and Hosni published in the June 2000 ASHRAE Journal addressed this
issue. Bottom line: about .5 to 1.0 watts per square foot. Useful information
and tables comparing nameplate data vs. measured power vs. overall office
diversity.

Article is available at ASHRAE site in .pdf form.  It is one of the more useful
publications to emerge from the ASHRAE research program, in my opinion.

Hello,
Does anyone have any advice on where to find curve fits for the performance
of a rotary chiller to use in PowerDOE?
I am particularly interested in the part-load ratio curve, as neither the
recip nor the centrifugal curves that are available would accurately model
the unloading of a rotary chiller.

Thanks.

Dear French building simulation users,

(I appologize for this message which is mainly interesting for
French users - contrary to SimCad for TRNSYS, CODYBA is
only available in French so far).

A program allowing to translate TRNSYS building description files (*.BUI
files) to the input language of the CODYBA building simulation
program is now available for free download on our WEB site.

This translator has been developed by Jean NOKL in the frame of a
colaboration between INSA Lyon and CSTB. It allows to use the
SimCad CAD software to be used with both TRNSYS and CODYBA.

If you are interested in this software, please go to the download section
on the following page:
