Subject: [Bldg-sim] How long it takes for energy modeling? HME
Message-ID: <405C8A3ED8EB824983B835EB43C2828102DD3B77@s-chp-hou-mail.chpengr.net>

I have done several energy models over the last few years using Trane
Trace.  I have heard others (typically from those who don't have
experience with energy modeling) say "it only takes a day" to create an
energy model and get results.  

I am trying to get a better understanding of how long it takes others to
complete an energy model.  I realize there are many factors involved and
length of time can vary drastically given the complexity of the project.

For an xxx sq ft project with xxx systems:

1.  What phase are you starting the energy model - SD, DD, CD?

2.  What information are you starting with - load results from another
program, rules of thumb for system sizing, etc?

3.  What program are you using?

4.  How long does it take to build the proposed model?

5.  How long does it take to build the baseline model (per ASHRAE
90.1-2004, Appendix G)?

6.  How long does it take to calculate the results from the energy
simulation program?

7.  If you have started a projected in the SD phase, how detailed is the
input information you use?  How do the results compare to the energy
model developed in CD - within 10%?

Any information you can provide would be helpful.

Thanks,

Sherie Hensley

Sherie-

I also agree with Chris.  In addition, in my experience I have never been
able to complete an energy model using eQuest and verify the results in one
day. I would be very skeptical to believe that, unless it was an extremely
simple and early stage model built completely in the wizard.

Dear colleagues,

 

This email is mainly directed towards those of you located in the larger
Boston area. 

 

In an effort to reach out to the local design community and to promote
the use of daylight in buildings we will be offering a series of free
one hour brown-bag presentations at the Harvard Design School starting
on Monday, April 20, at noon in Stubbins, Gund Hall, 48 Quincy Street in
Cambridge. In this initial presentation I will be discussing the results
of two very recent studies: A validation of 3ds Max Design compared to
indoor illuminance measurements as well as a study that investigated
common simulation mistakes that daylight simulation novices make. The
focus audience for this presentation are design practitioners interested
in adding physically based daylight simulations to their design
portfolio. Following the presentation you are very welcome to stay
around for a bit and share some of your own simulation activities. 

 

Please RVSP Brooke King at bking at gsd.harvard.edu should you intend to
join us. There will be no lunch provided but you are welcome to bring
your own. The conference room is located next to our cafeteria.

 

I look forward to meeting some of you in a few weeks. Best regards,

Jessica,

 

The DOE2 website has some non-US bin files. You can find an Asian zip
file that has Shanghai at:

Sherie - I'll do my best. The majority of our energy models are for the sole purpose of performing an Energy Life Cycle Cost Analysis for schools and other government funded buildings here in Washington State. These reports are used to aid the owner in making decisions regarding envelope design, HVAC systems, lighting controls and power density, etc. that best suit their needs.

1. SD - Providing we have adequate building layouts from the Architect.

2. Rules of thumb system sizing and Industry Standards. If equipment schedules are completed we use those.

3. eQuest.

4. We normally build 1 model in the design wizard that includes all systems to be studied in the report (normally 4 systems includeing an ASHRAE G baseline). Then each system gets modeled seperately using this main model as a starting point. Normally it takes 40 hours to get this starting model built with all utility rates, schedules, envelope parameters, etc. established for the project.

5 & 6. Another 40 - 60 hours is spent developing the 4 seperate models for HVAC system types to be studied, fine tuning each model, and anaylizing the outputs.

7. If you start a project in SD you have to understand that it is a snap-shot in time. How it compares to the CD varies greatly.

We are also writing a report with a very specific layout/guideline to follow. The hours for writing the report are not included here.

As other people have stated hours can vary greatly but on average we are able to complete our models/simulations within these ranges.

I have done several energy models over the last few years using Trane Trace.  I have heard others (typically from those who don't have experience with energy modeling) say "it only takes a day" to create an energy model and get results.

I am trying to get a better understanding of how long it takes others to complete an energy model.  I realize there are many factors involved and length of time can vary drastically given the complexity of the project.

For an xxx sq ft project with xxx systems:

1.  What phase are you starting the energy model - SD, DD, CD?

2.  What information are you starting with - load results from another program, rules of thumb for system sizing, etc?

3.  What program are you using?

4.  How long does it take to build the proposed model?

5.  How long does it take to build the baseline model (per ASHRAE 90.1-2004, Appendix G)?

6.  How long does it take to calculate the results from the energy simulation program?

7.  If you have started a projected in the SD phase, how detailed is the input information you use?  How do the results compare to the energy model developed in CD - within 10%?

Any information you can provide would be helpful.

Thanks,

Sherie Hensley

All,

Is anyone familiar with any prevalent greenhouse gas emission reduction
targets specific to architecture/design firms in the US?

Sorry for the cross postings.

Message-ID: <a590350904061527v7bc912e8sc0b7334daeaaeeaa@mail.gmail.com>

All,

Attached is the illuminance (global horizontal) for Boise, ID, from
TMY2 data. Note the valley in the graph on the left bottom corner
which is caused by the very low illuminance values for January (the
values are in the hundreds, compared to tens of thousand in February).
I know for a fact that in Boise January is not (much) darker than
December or February.

Furthermore, the corresponding radiation data do not have that dip in
January. The illumination values are calculated based on the radiation
data, right? So if there is nothing wrong in the radiation data, is
this related to the model used in converting radiation data into
illumination values?

I also checked another site in Idaho, it has the same dark January.

Any thoughts?

Thanks,

Ery

Hi Ery,

I don't know if this was also a problem with TMY2 or if you meant TMY3,
but TMY3 files have the problem you observed. See the notice listed on
this website:

http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/1991-2005/tmy3/

For what it's worth, certain simulation engines (like EnergyPlus) don't
use that data from the weather file.

Hope that helps,

Scott

Thanks Teri. I did not frame my question right.

I was actually referring to setting reduction a target after a complete
greenhouse gas accounting exercise (including operational energy,
transportation to and from work, work related long distance travel, material
recycling etc). I'm looking for an answer like 10% reduction over yr 2001
baseline by 2015.

I've been doing some research on this topic for a bit and have found
most of the reduction targets depend on who is mandating/reviewing the
CO2 reductions.  If the carbon reduction for the building is anticipated
to be a marketable reduction credit, then the Chicago Climate Exchange
will determine the baseline and the required reduction percentage per
year.  If you are participating in the World Wildlife Foundation's
Climate Savers program, the baseline will be different as will the
agreed-upon reduction requirements.  The U.S. EPA also is developing a
scheme as part of President Obama's plans to address climate change
through a cap-and-trade program.

 

I guess the best answer is - it depends on who you are providing the
benchmarking information to.  The Architecture 2030 Challenge is
commonly referenced because it does set specific percentage reductions,
and even though they are for the work product of architectural firms the
same goals would need to be true for the architects implementing them in
the interest of "walking the talk" so to speak.  Those percentage
reductions are referenced as "reductions over the current national
average for that building type" for the project.  In the US, that would
be the 2003 CBECS energy baseline.  The 2030 Challenge percentages are:

60% in 2010

70% in 2015

80% in 2020

90% in 2025 

100% in 2030 (Carbon Neutral)

 

These are in reference to building energy use, but I would suggest that
to have a meaningful impact on climate change the same targets need to
be set for the other factors of your carbon footprint (transportation,
business travel, embodied carbon of material consumption and recycling,
etc.).

 

I'm not sure if this answers your question, but I'm not sure the answer
you are looking for is outside of your team.  If I was in your shoes, I
would sit down with my team and ask three questions:

1.	What do we believe is the smallest reduction we can commit to
and still have an impact?
2.	What is the largest reduction we can commit to accomplish within
our sphere of influence?
3.	What can we successfully replicate with our clients when they
ask us this same question?

I'd suggest that the answer to number 3 is probably somewhere between
the answers to 1 and 2 and close to the number you'll finally settle on.
I'm up for more discussion on this topic if you want - I'm passionate
and interested in this topic and continually frustrated by how many
different answers are out there and how political the issue has become.
Hope this helps!

Hi,

 

I wondered has anyone come across latest research on comparison of
different energy simulation software with actual buildings performance.
I would be very appreciate your replies and happy to summarise and share
findings at a later stage. 

 

Many thanks

Bill - the 10% was just an example to help understand the format in  
which I was looking for an answer, not to be taken literally.

Look forward to any other information you might find.

Hal - thanks for your detailed reply, will write to you once I review.

Scott,

Thanks for the info. I know that the solution can be as simple as that.

This data is of course important only for the (annual) daylighting
calculation. Daysim is using this data. I suspect even EPlus or eQuest
will use this data for daylight control.

Thanks,

Ery

Hello, Jeremy:

 

Thanks for focusing our discussion in this manner. I completely concur
with your call for further specificity, but would like to frame it as
follows:

 

Climate change has changed all the rules that humans play by. Therefore
we need to re-arrange our paradigms, which means all games that we
engage in (and professions) need to be re-formulated and re-formatted
"in terms of" climate change. Aesthetics, architecture, food production,
politics, economics, building sector, transportation ... all.

I've been doing some research on this topic for a bit and have found
most of the reduction targets depend on who is mandating/reviewing the
CO2 reductions.  If the carbon reduction for the building is anticipated
to be a marketable reduction credit, then the Chicago Climate Exchange
will determine the baseline and the required reduction percentage per
year.  If you are participating in the World Wildlife Foundation's
Climate Savers program, the baseline will be different as will the
agreed-upon reduction requirements.  The U.S. EPA also is developing a
scheme as part of President Obama's plans to address climate change
through a cap-and-trade program.

 

I guess the best answer is - it depends on who you are providing the
benchmarking information to.  The Architecture 2030 Challenge is
commonly referenced because it does set specific percentage reductions,
and even though they are for the work product of architectural firms the
same goals would need to be true for the architects implementing them in
the interest of "walking the talk" so to speak.  Those percentage
reductions are referenced as "reductions over the current national
average for that building type" for the project.  In the US, that would
be the 2003 CBECS energy baseline.  The 2030 Challenge percentages are:

60% in 2010

70% in 2015

80% in 2020

90% in 2025

100% in 2030 (Carbon Neutral)

 

These are in reference to building energy use, but I would suggest that
to have a meaningful impact on climate change the same targets need to
be set for the other factors of your carbon footprint (transportation,
business travel, embodied carbon of material consumption and recycling,
etc.).

 

I'm not sure if this answers your question, but I'm not sure the answer
you are looking for is outside of your team.  If I was in your shoes, I
would sit down with my team and ask three questions:

1.	What do we believe is the smallest reduction we can commit to
and still have an impact?
2.	What is the largest reduction we can commit to accomplish within
our sphere of influence?
3.	What can we successfully replicate with our clients when they
ask us this same question?

I'd suggest that the answer to number 3 is probably somewhere between
the answers to 1 and 2 and close to the number you'll finally settle on.
I'm up for more discussion on this topic if you want - I'm passionate
and interested in this topic and continually frustrated by how many
different answers are out there and how political the issue has become.
Hope this helps!

Thanks Teri. I did not frame my question right.

I was actually referring to setting reduction a target after a complete
greenhouse gas accounting exercise (including operational energy,
transportation to and from work, work related long distance travel,
material recycling etc). I'm looking for an answer like 10% reduction
over yr 2001 baseline by 2015.

Hello Yangang,

Crawley et al have compared 20 different enregy simulation softwares. The report can be found at the link below; I am not sure if there has been a follow-up study since.

Crawley D., Hand J., Kummert M., Griffith B. (July 2005). ?Contrasting the capabilities of building energy performance simulation programs?, version 1.0, United States Department of Energy, University of Strathclyde and University of Wisconsin. 
http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/tools_directory/pdfs/contrasting_the_capabilities_of_building_energy_performance_simulation_programs_v1.0.pdf?
?
It's not a comparison of building performance using various software, if that's what you're looking for. It's a comparison of features of? different programs.

Scott,

Thanks for the info. I know that the solution can be as simple as that.

This data is of course important only for the (annual) daylighting
calculation. Daysim is using this data. I suspect even EPlus or eQuest
will use this data for daylight control.

Thanks,

our sphere of influence?
3.??? What can we successfully replicate with our clients when they
ask us this same question?

I'd suggest that the answer to number 3 is probably somewhere between
the answers to 1 and 2 and close to the number you'll finally settle on.
I'm up for more discussion on this topic if you want - I'm passionate
and interested in this topic and continually frustrated by how many
different answers are out there and how political the issue has become.
Hope this helps!

Thanks Teri. I did not frame my question right.

I was actually referring to setting reduction a target after a complete
greenhouse gas accounting exercise (including operational energy,
transportation to and from work, work related long distance travel,
material recycling etc). I'm looking for an answer like 10% reduction
over yr 2001 baseline by 2015.

 Hi Ery,

I think illumination value can't be calculated from radiation data.
Different skymodel and altitude of the sun provide different efficacy.

Hi,

 

I wondered has anyone come across latest research on comparison of different energy simulation software with actual buildings performance. I would be very appreciate your replies and happy to summarise and share findings at a later stage.

Dear colleagues:

 

It might be a complete 'faux pas' to send a design sequence based on
rules of thumb to a building simulation mailing list. But, I take the
risk. We recently developed and validated a rules-of-thumb based design
sequence for diffuse daylighting:
http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/people/faculty/reinhart/documents/DiffuseDayl
ightingDesignSequenceTutorial.pdf. The series offers design advice for
daylighting at the programming and massing stage and - being based on
the daylight factor  - applies to climates with either mostly diffuse
sky conditions or heavily obstructed sites. Alternatively, the design
sequence can be used in combination with a direct shading study. The
supporting research can be found at
http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/people/faculty/reinhart/documents/DiffuseDayl
ightingDesignSequenceInLRT.pdf.

Message-ID: <767743367B06D146BCE70D51BC4A1781E5EEDAD9@MAILR004.mail.lan>

I was determining flow rates for a building when I ran across this conundrum concerning outdoor air requirements in storage rooms.  Hopefully someone can help me out.

Vbz=RpPz + RaAz
Where Az is the "zone floor area: the net occupiable floor area of the zone" and Ra is the "outdoor airflow rate required per unit area as determined from Table 6-1".  Mechanical rooms have a value for Ra listed in Table 6.1.

However, occupiable space is defined under "Definitions" as "an enclosed space intended for human activities, excluding those spaces intended primarily for other purposes, such as storage rooms and equipment rooms, that are only occupied occasionally and for short periods of time".

Does this mean that there are no outdoor air flow requirements for storage rooms?  If so, why is there a value listed for the outdoor airflow rate required per unit area?

Thanks,
Gregg Liddick

Hi!

 

We are currently involved in a project where we want to simulate a circular "glasshouse".

 

There?s a lot of windows and we are there for very concerned about the shading devices. 

 

There will probably be a outside, vertical, blind device.

 

Does anyone have any info where to find values  for input in IES VE. We are very concerned about the "night-case" and night time resistance.

 

Input fields in IES:

Incident radiation to lower device (0-600)

Incident radiation to raise device (0-600)

Nighttime resistance (0-2,5)

Daytime resistance (0-2,5)

 

We are very grateful for are kind of help and information where we can find information about this!

Yes it does.

Please see Addendum a to ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004.

Section G2.1.4 states that the simulation program shall be tested
according to ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 140 and the results shall be furnished
by the software provider.

If you go to IES/VE website, you'll find documentation regarding its
testing according to Standard 140.

You might want to try a data file for typical meteorological year for a
location of similar latitude, like Guam 

<http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/tmy2/State.html>.  This will
give you usable solar insolation values, and radiation is most critical in
simulation of sub-tropical locations; but, since Guam is an island the
diurnal temperatures will not be as pronounced as Malaysia, and this will be
important to your HVAC study.

Thanks Christoph,

Nice work. While anything based on daylight factors is limiting, you  
have qualified that every step of the way. The nice thing about this  
is that you have created a process for really applying a daylight  
factor approach early on in the design process. You should cross-post  
this to the radiance list!

If "Day Type" that Kevin is referring to, is related to scheduling and  
hourly report, then I think 1 = Monday as Scott has mentioned, here is  
the first 2 days of the hourly report of my recent project of 2009.

Month	Day		Type
1	1		8
1	2		5

Apparently this year Jan 2 is a Friday (=5), thus Monday = 1.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] New Version -- EnergyPlus v3.1 and OpenStudio v1.0.3 now
 available
Message-ID: <4B55C0CF3DB1354A9524C7D455EE6D4902A25B82@HQGTNEVS-04.doe.local>

EnergyPlus Version 3.1 Available 

 

The latest release of the EnergyPlus building energy simulation program,
Version 3.1, is now available in versions for Windows, Linux, and Mac
operating systems. A few key new features include simplified rectangular
geometry for walls, roofs, ceilings, floors, windows, and shading;
thermochromic windows; upgraded UFAD model; Standard 62.1 demand control
ventilation; cool beam HVAC model; new tabular reports to support LEED
EA Credit 1 forms; and new post-processing utility to combine Standard
90.1 Appendix rotation results. We have updated and extended
capabilities throughout the existing building envelope, daylighting, and
HVAC equipment and systems portions of the program. 

 

EnergyPlus V 3.1 is available at no cost from the EnergyPlus web site:
www.energyplus.gov <http://www.energyplus.gov/> .

OpenStudio plugin for Google SketchUp: The OpenStudio
<http://www.energyplus.gov/energy_design_plugin.cfm>  is a free plugin
for the GoogleSketchUp 3D drawing program. The plugin makes it easy to
create and edit the building geometry in your EnergyPlus input files.
The plugin also allows you to launch EnergyPlus simulations and view the
results without leaving SketchUp.

EnergyPlus Example File Generator: A Web-based service is available that
creates and runs EnergyPlus input files for simple models of commercial
buildings. The input files (and annual results summary files) are sent
to your e-mail address as attachments. This is a pilot project and is
currently made available only as a BETA service. You can access the
service and customize the characteristics of the building you want to
model on the EnergyPlus Example File Generator Application
<http://www.energyplus.gov/cfm/inputs/>  (pop-ups must be enabled).

The set of example input files now includes full-blown models of typical
new construction (drawn from the DOE Commercial Benchmarks project). 




What's New in Version 3.1?

 

Input

*         Furnaces/Unitary Systems now allow high humidity control with
cycling supply air fan systems.

*         Cool Beam model added.

*         Option to size system flow rate and terminal units based on
minimum ventilation requirements added; other zone equipment will be
sized on zone loads

*         Fan:OnOff now models multi-speed fan performance.

*         Minimum stops on VAV terminals with reheat can now be
scheduled.

*         SensibleAndLatent and Desiccant Heat Exchangers now have
economizer lockout option.

*         Revised air-bypass logic for HeatExchanger:AirToAir:FlatPlate
to match the logic used for HeatExchanger:AirToAir:SensibleAndLatent.

*         Refrigeration racks and systems now accept either the name of
a case or caselist, and compressor or compressorlist.

*         Improved moisture condensation controls for Low Temperature
Radiant systems.

*         EvaporativeCooler:Direct:ResearchSpecial model added.

*         Water consumption model for Indirect Evaporative Cooler
extended. Secondary air flow rate can now be autosized.

And many other enhancements and speed improvements throughout.  

See http://www.energyplus.gov/features.html
<http://www.energyplus.gov/features.html>   for a complete list of new
features added in this and previous versions.

Suggestion: get as much memory as possible in your computer for running
EnergyPlus.  A recent team upgrade from 1.8GHZ machine with 768MB memory
to a 2.1GHZ machine with 2GB memory caused one file to go from a full
annual simulation (5 zones) at about 8 minutes to a 2-1/4 minute run on
the newer machine. 

Update on User Interfaces and Tools?

Many user interfaces that create and run EnergyPlus input files and
display results graphically are available (Demand Response Quick
Assessment Tool, DesignBuilder, Easy EnergyPlus, EFEN, Hevacomp, and
HLCP) and under development (ComFen, TREATPlus and EPlusInterface).
Check our web site (http://www.energyplus.gov/ep_interfaces.html
<http://www.energyplus.gov/ep_interfaces.html>  ) for up-to-date
information on these and other interfaces.

Utilities and tools for creating, editing, and running input files that
come with EnergyPlus include IDF Editor, EP-Launch, and HVAC-Diagram
(see http://www.energyplus.gov/ep_utilities.html
<http://www.energyplus.gov/ep_utilities.html>  ). Third party tools for
creating, editing, and displaying EnergyPlus input files are also
available, including DrawBDL, EcoTect, EnergyPlugged, ESP-r, Green
Building Studio, EzDrawPlus, IFCtoIDF, TSe+, and EzPlus-Parm.  See
http://www.energyplus.gov/third_party_tools.html
<http://www.energyplus.gov/third_party_tools.html>  for more
information.

 

EnergyPlus Training Workshops

 

We will continue to offer training workshops throughout 2009.  For more
information, please see:  http://www.gard.com/training.htm
<http://www.gard.com/training.htm> 

 


What's going on in V3.1.0?

 

Will there be any considerable difference between version 3.0 and 3.1? 

Yes.... and no.  As always, there are a number of new features and bug
fixes.  The highlights of features for this version are listed below-see
http://www.energyplus.gov/features.html
<http://www.energyplus.gov/features.html>  for a complete list of new
features added in this and previous versions.

How about IDF and IDD? Do they remain unchanged?

There will be some changes in the IDD and reflected in IDFs.
Particularly for any new features, there will be new objects. Your best
option is to use the included Transition program if you want to use any
older version files.

Is version 3.1 backward compatible? Can I run v3.0 file in v3.1? 

 

For many options, the answer is yes. However, there are several changes
that require you to use the transition program for V3.1. EP-Launch can
check the selected file (if there is a version object) and you can
launch the Transition program from the EP-Launch "File" menu. You can
also view the ObjectStatus spreadsheet in the root folder of the
installed version. This file has detailed explanations of changes to the
objects. There is also a new option for the transition program that
allows you to supply a list of files and it will convert them for you.
The transition program is described more fully in the Auxiliary Programs
document.

There is usually a determination that needs to be made between inactive
storage rooms and active storage rooms. You are correct in that if a
storage room is not intended to be occupied by definition than it does
not require OA. Important also is often small storage rooms may contain
noxious chemicals for cleaning that fall under completely different
criteria.

 

However, with regards to 62.1, the calculation allows rooms that are not
in any way critical spaces (high Evz) to be removed. I would imagine
that if you do decide to provide ventilation to an inactive storage room
it would not be considered your critical space, and therefore is
irrelevant to the calculation.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] 62.1 Net Occupiable Area

 

I was determining flow rates for a building when I ran across this
conundrum concerning outdoor air requirements in storage rooms.
Hopefully someone can help me out.

 

Vbz=RpPz + RaAz

Where Az is the "zone floor area: the net occupiable floor area of the
zone" and Ra is the "outdoor airflow rate required per unit area as
determined from Table 6-1".  Mechanical rooms have a value for Ra listed
in Table 6.1.  

 

However, occupiable space is defined under "Definitions" as "an enclosed
space intended for human activities, excluding those spaces intended
primarily for other purposes, such as storage rooms and equipment rooms,
that are only occupied occasionally and for short periods of time".

 

Does this mean that there are no outdoor air flow requirements for
storage rooms?  If so, why is there a value listed for the outdoor
airflow rate required per unit area?

 

Thanks,

Gregg Liddick

James,

 

We've recently reviewed this topic and came up with information from the
DOE-2 help files that has a picture (Figure 37) that shows the fPLR curves
for the different fan control methods.  If you do a search for "FAN-CONTROL"
you should be able to find Figure 37 and do some take-offs to compare
baseline and proposed performances.  I've attached a screenshot of the DOE-2
help screen.  Hopefully it comes through for you.

Does anyone have the default curve data for this fan curve?

 

I've got a built-up AHU I'm modeling with a fan-wall configuration, and I
know that the EIR vs part load ratio should be better than the default VFD
fan curve.

 

But I can't seem to get  savings by defining a performance curve using the
100%, 90%, 80%, etc values.  It might help if I had the default values.

 

Thanks!

Dear software developers,

There is a software tool that provides an analysis, exploration and verification environment for software implementation and optimization on multicore architectures.  This tool is developed by CriticalBlue and called Prism.  Their website address is http://www.criticalblue.com/index.shtml.  Hopefully this or something like it, will help developers optimize energy simulation programs to utilize multicore processors.

There is usually a determination that needs to be made between inactive
storage rooms and active storage rooms. You are correct in that if a storage
room is not intended to be occupied by definition than it does not require
OA. Important also is often small storage rooms may contain noxious
chemicals for cleaning that fall under completely different criteria.

 

However, with regards to 62.1, the calculation allows rooms that are not in
any way critical spaces (high Evz) to be removed. I would imagine that if
you do decide to provide ventilation to an inactive storage room it would
not be considered your critical space, and therefore is irrelevant to the
calculation.

I was determining flow rates for a building when I ran across this conundrum
concerning outdoor air requirements in storage rooms.  Hopefully someone can
help me out.

 

Vbz=RpPz + RaAz

Where Az is the "zone floor area: the net occupiable floor area of the zone"
and Ra is the "outdoor airflow rate required per unit area as determined
from Table 6-1".  Mechanical rooms have a value for Ra listed in Table 6.1.


 

However, occupiable space is defined under "Definitions" as "an enclosed
space intended for human activities, excluding those spaces intended
primarily for other purposes, such as storage rooms and equipment rooms,
that are only occupied occasionally and for short periods of time".

 

Does this mean that there are no outdoor air flow requirements for storage
rooms?  If so, why is there a value listed for the outdoor airflow rate
required per unit area?

 

Thanks,

which is conditioned, 20 HVAC systems are being used maintained by CHILLER.

 

Can any one please tell me how to model 20 different systems in Visual DOE? 

Is I have to make single zone for one system or any other single system that
is comparable.

 

It will be helpful if you explain in details,

Does anyone have any experience using the ASHRAE 90.1-2004 compliance
module for EnergyPro?  Our company is looking at purchasing the software
and we have some questions about it before investing in it.

 

Has it simplified the LEED documentation process by a considerable amount?


Has USGBC had any problems with the way it sets up the baseline model?

Does automatically building the baseline model makeup for the fact that
building geometry is more difficult to setup in EnergyPro than in eQUEST?

What's your overall feeling about EnergyPro vs. other energy simulation
software?  Is DOE2.1 an outdated software?

Karen,

 

The ASHRAE-55 Thermal Comfort Tool created by the UC Berkeley Center for
the Built Environment and available from ASHRAE publications (if I
recall correctly) includes a very easy-to-use MRT calculator for
rectangular rooms. It allows for MRT at a particular position in that
room, separate surface temperatures and dimensions for surfaces, and
also the inclusion of a "panel" or other area within one of the walls
(such as a cold/hot window, heating panel, etc.) that has a distinct
temperature. This is part of a very handy tool for determining PPD, etc.
based upon the typical range of human thermal comfort variables (clo
value, activity level, air temp, MRT, humidity, air movement).

 

Cheers,

Timothy

haven't used the other tool, so I can't offer a comparison - just
another option.

It's an interesting conundrum that the times that MRT becomes a
significant player in the comfort calculation is when there is an uneven
radiant field (hot or cold window; fireplace; thermal mass wall). In
such a situation, is it fair to average out the MRT for an entire room?
Don't your view factors change drastically depending on your position in
the room? 

 

Does one person too hot near the window and another person too cold on
the inside equal thermal comfort?

Karen,

 

The ASHRAE-55 Thermal Comfort Tool created by the UC Berkeley Center for
the Built Environment and available from ASHRAE publications (if I
recall correctly) includes a very easy-to-use MRT calculator for
rectangular rooms. It allows for MRT at a particular position in that
room, separate surface temperatures and dimensions for surfaces, and
also the inclusion of a "panel" or other area within one of the walls
(such as a cold/hot window, heating panel, etc.) that has a distinct
temperature. This is part of a very handy tool for determining PPD, etc.
based upon the typical range of human thermal comfort variables (clo
value, activity level, air temp, MRT, humidity, air movement).

 

Cheers,

Timothy

Hello,

Is anyone aware of a simple Mean Radiant Temperature calculation tool?
I'm looking for something that will calculate MRT for a basic
rectangular room.

Thanks!

Vikram, of course those two people even things out!!  Umm, but really, this
is why I'm looking for a MRT calculator.  This way I can test a few
locations in a given room quickly (much easier than doing hand calcs).  I
think that www.meanradianttemperature.com used to have one online, but the
site seems to be down.  Does anyone have any information?  Is this site down
permanently, or is this a temporary issue?

I will probably end up with the ASHRAE calculator as it seems easiest to
use.

Thanks for all the input.

Ah, another can of worms. MRT is probably the least understood and
certainly the least calculated of space thermodynamics. ASHRAE RP 1383
was specifically set up to calculate MRT for spaces, even having unusual
configurations. It should be ready in about 18 months or so? 

So Vikram, with reference to your analogy, how about this one?

Imagine a space that is naturally ventilated through an open window, at
this certain time of the day the occupant is in such a position that the
suns rays reach the occupant through the open window. What would the MRT
be in the space and how would this affect the occupants comfort.

ESP-r has a module that can calculate the view factor in any position
in the room. If you have the geometry in ESP-r, then you can specify a
location anywhere in the space, and the module will calculate the view
factor at that particular location.

I really miss that module when I work in EnergyPlus.

Cheeers,

The ASHRAE Standard-55 Comfort Model (proper name) does allow for a
single user input. However, immediately to the right of the MRT value,
it also includes a "Calc" button that opens a separate dialog. In this
separate dialog, the user can enter values for the following parameters:

 

Room dimensions

Occupant location

Occupant orientation (facing wall or azimuth)

Occupant position (seated or standing)

Temperature for each of four walls, ceiling, and floor

And dimensions, location, and temperature for a "window or panel" area
within each of the four walls, ceiling, and floor.

 

I just sent a post with the actual MRT calculation dialog box (for those
of you that receive visuals in your emails); however, it appears that
the screen shot of the dialog was too big for the Bldg-Sim list serve.

 

The IES Virtual Environment also provides MRT, dry resultant
temperature, and the full range of ASHRAE 55 thermal comfort input
parameters and results (PPD, PMV, etc.) for a location in the center of
the room, as well as surface temperature results for each individual
surface in the model. These surface temperatures, for any given
simulation time step, can then be readily entered into the ASHRAE
Standard-55 Comfort Model above if one is interested in thermal comfort
for a specific location within a rectangular room.

Karen,

 

The ASHRAE-55 Thermal Comfort Tool created by the UC Berkeley Center for
the Built Environment and available from ASHRAE publications (if I
recall correctly) includes a very easy-to-use MRT calculator for
rectangular rooms. It allows for MRT at a particular position in that
room, separate surface temperatures and dimensions for surfaces, and
also the inclusion of a "panel" or other area within one of the walls
(such as a cold/hot window, heating panel, etc.) that has a distinct
temperature. This is part of a very handy tool for determining PPD, etc.
based upon the typical range of human thermal comfort variables (clo
value, activity level, air temp, MRT, humidity, air movement).

 

Cheers,

Timothy

Regarding asymmetrical thermal comfort and that involving transmitted
short-wave radiation, the following link will get you an excellent
(lengthy, detailed, and very helpful) paper on thermal comfort in
proximity to windows. It discusses the effects of glass surface
temperatures and transmission properties, along with possible options
for including a rating of thermal comfort performance on NFRC window
labeling.

 

Huizenga, C., H. Zhang, P. Mattelaer, T. Yu, E. Arens, and P. Lyons,
2006. Window Performance for Human Thermal Comfort
<http://www.cbe.berkeley.edu/research/pdf_files/SR_NFRC2006_FinalReport.
pdf> . Final Report to the National Fenestration Rating Council, Center
for the Built Environment, University of California, Berkeley, February.

 

You do not need an open window to have comfort issues associated with
transmitted short-wave radiation, nor does it have to be direct-beam
radiation-any window permitting occupants to receive a good dose of
transmitted diffuse and/or direct solar radiation is reason enough to
care about this effect. The paper at the CBE link above provides a very
useful means of estimating the contribution of both direct-beam and
diffuse solar radiation. The discussion of the impact of diffuse
radiation begins on page 44 and the discussion of direct radiation
starts on page 49.

 

CBE's Advanced Thermal Comfort Model
<http://www.cbe.berkeley.edu/research/briefs-thermmodel.htm>  

This tool can used to study the effectiveness of energy saving design
strategies, such as facade designs and advanced HVAC systems, in terms
of occupant comfort. 



In addition, the CBE has an Advanced Thermal Comfort model that they
will be happy to run for you as consultants to your project (and which
their industry partners also have direct access to) which takes into
account short-wave radiation striking a human subject, along with
numerous very detailed thermal comfort parameters. This tool was used
for several key sections of the paper linked above, so you can see
examples of the model and results there. Not only does this model
account for occupant attributes like body mass (along with the usual
comfort parameters), it actually models 16 different human body parts
and the constriction and dilation of blood vessels that accompanies
different thermo-physiological states. This model, which is not really
all that difficult to work with, has been used for CBE consulting to the
automotive industry and a in-house by handful of large A&E firms. If you
want to learn more, the following link takes you to the section of the
CBE web site describing this tool:

Timothy

So Vikram, with reference to your analogy, how about this one?

Imagine a space that is naturally ventilated through an open window, at
this certain time of the day the occupant is in such a position that the
suns rays reach the occupant through the open window. What would the MRT
be in the space and how would this affect the occupants comfort.

It's an interesting conundrum that the times that MRT becomes a
significant player in the comfort calculation is when there is an uneven
radiant field (hot or cold window; fireplace; thermal mass wall). In
such a situation, is it fair to average out the MRT for an entire room?
Don't your view factors change drastically depending on your position in
the room? 

 

Does one person too hot near the window and another person too cold on
the inside equal thermal comfort?

Karen,

 

The ASHRAE-55 Thermal Comfort Tool created by the UC Berkeley Center for
the Built Environment and available from ASHRAE publications (if I
recall correctly) includes a very easy-to-use MRT calculator for
rectangular rooms. It allows for MRT at a particular position in that
room, separate surface temperatures and dimensions for surfaces, and
also the inclusion of a "panel" or other area within one of the walls
(such as a cold/hot window, heating panel, etc.) that has a distinct
temperature. This is part of a very handy tool for determining PPD, etc.
based upon the typical range of human thermal comfort variables (clo
value, activity level, air temp, MRT, humidity, air movement).

 

Cheers,

Timothy

Hello

I have few queries regarding rescheduling in Open Studio. Also I am a new
user of Energy+.

*1.* I produce basic building geometry in Sketchup and set the available
input data. One thing that I understand from this is that Open Studio have
very limited inputs. Also scheduling is automatically set for the
simulations. Then I run the E+ simulation within Sketchup. I want only the
zone comfort i.e. (MRT and MAT). The result in excel format have
temperatures within every 15 mins. But I want the hourly temperature
only. *What
I have to do for hourly result within sketchup*?

*2. *I want to take this process further. I want to edit the scheduling and
change the building materials. What I understand from this is that sketchup
help in setting the building coordinates easily. After setting the building
geometry in sketchup, can one edit the scheduling and other related stuff
that is taken default in open studio. The (.idf file) produce in Open Studio
while saving, can this (.idf file) after rearranging the scheduling and
changing material assembly in IPF Editor work for further simulation
analysis. Can this process be done? I tried this but its giving errors. Hope
I am able to explain my query.

Please help me.

Thanks

You may also be interested in the work reported in an ASHRAE paper that
appeared at the last Chicago meeting:
 
"Predicting Local Thermal Discomfort Adjacent to
Glazing (NY-08-053)
Simon J. Rees, Ph.D., Member, Kevin J. Lomas, Ph.D. and
Dusan Fiala, De Montfort University, Leicester, UK

In this work a multi-segment dynamic comfort model has
been employed that incorporates recently developed models
of local thermal comfort response. The work required the
development of simulation methods able to predict the detailed
long-wave and convective exchanges to the surrounding
space and the absorbed solar irradiation. This has been done
in an effi cient and generic manner so that parametric studies
of local comfort responses have been possible. Such studies
have been used to examine the relationships between local
discomfort and room and window temperatures as well as the
role solar irradiation and clothing may play in determining
satisfactory winter environmental conditions."
 
The main points to note are that the model uses a local rather than
global comfort model i.e. effects on particular body parts are
considered. Direct solar radiation and shading of particular body parts
are calculated. View factors for each body part are calculated for a
particular body position relative to the room rather than calculating
the MRT.

Simon

Regarding asymmetrical thermal comfort and that involving transmitted
short-wave radiation, the following link will get you an excellent
(lengthy, detailed, and very helpful) paper on thermal comfort in
proximity to windows. It discusses the effects of glass surface
temperatures and transmission properties, along with possible options
for including a rating of thermal comfort performance on NFRC window
labeling.

 

Huizenga, C., H. Zhang, P. Mattelaer, T. Yu, E. Arens, and P. Lyons,
2006. Window Performance for Human Thermal Comfort
<http://www.cbe.berkeley.edu/research/pdf_files/SR_NFRC2006_FinalReport.
pdf> . Final Report to the National Fenestration Rating Council, Center
for the Built Environment, University of California, Berkeley, February.

 

You do not need an open window to have comfort issues associated with
transmitted short-wave radiation, nor does it have to be direct-beam
radiation-any window permitting occupants to receive a good dose of
transmitted diffuse and/or direct solar radiation is reason enough to
care about this effect. The paper at the CBE link above provides a very
useful means of estimating the contribution of both direct-beam and
diffuse solar radiation. The discussion of the impact of diffuse
radiation begins on page 44 and the discussion of direct radiation
starts on page 49.

 

CBE's Advanced Thermal Comfort Model
<http://www.cbe.berkeley.edu/research/briefs-thermmodel.htm>  

This tool can used to study the effectiveness of energy saving design
strategies, such as facade designs and advanced HVAC systems, in terms
of occupant comfort. 



In addition, the CBE has an Advanced Thermal Comfort model that they
will be happy to run for you as consultants to your project (and which
their industry partners also have direct access to) which takes into
account short-wave radiation striking a human subject, along with
numerous very detailed thermal comfort parameters. This tool was used
for several key sections of the paper linked above, so you can see
examples of the model and results there. Not only does this model
account for occupant attributes like body mass (along with the usual
comfort parameters), it actually models 16 different human body parts
and the constriction and dilation of blood vessels that accompanies
different thermo-physiological states. This model, which is not really
all that difficult to work with, has been used for CBE consulting to the
automotive industry and a in-house by handful of large A&E firms. If you
want to learn more, the following link takes you to the section of the
CBE web site describing this tool:

NO.  It is the wrong answer, but now you need to know things like the RT

background sky RT, luminosity...

Ah, another can of worms. MRT is probably the least understood and
certainly the least calculated of space thermodynamics. ASHRAE RP 1383
was specifically set up to calculate MRT for spaces, even having unusual
configurations. It should be ready in about 18 months or so? 

So Vikram, with reference to your analogy, how about this one?

Imagine a space that is naturally ventilated through an open window, at
this certain time of the day the occupant is in such a position that the
suns rays reach the occupant through the open window. What would the MRT
be in the space and how would this affect the occupants comfort.

It's an interesting conundrum that the times that MRT becomes a
significant player in the comfort calculation is when there is an uneven
radiant field (hot or cold window; fireplace; thermal mass wall). In
such a situation, is it fair to average out the MRT for an entire room?
Don't your view factors change drastically depending on your position in
the room? 

 

Does one person too hot near the window and another person too cold on
the inside equal thermal comfort?

Karen,

 

The ASHRAE-55 Thermal Comfort Tool created by the UC Berkeley Center for
the Built Environment and available from ASHRAE publications (if I
recall correctly) includes a very easy-to-use MRT calculator for
rectangular rooms. It allows for MRT at a particular position in that
room, separate surface temperatures and dimensions for surfaces, and
also the inclusion of a "panel" or other area within one of the walls
(such as a cold/hot window, heating panel, etc.) that has a distinct
temperature. This is part of a very handy tool for determining PPD, etc.
based upon the typical range of human thermal comfort variables (clo
value, activity level, air temp, MRT, humidity, air movement).

 

Cheers,

Timothy

You may want to post this question on the Energyplus support group page
or mailing list see below.

 

To hopefully answer some of your questions though the output file you
likely will want to view for your analysis is the .eso file and there is
a great viewer xEsoView that is free and is great for viewing these
outputs. To determine what variables are presented in the ESO file you
will need to add the variables from the RDD file to the IDF file if the
variables are not presently being reported. I believe you will need to
do this in the IDF editor, and if you have run the simulation once there
will be a drop down list of available variables in the IDF menu for
Reports:Variables.

 

I would recommend reporting the variables at the same timestep your
simulation is running in this case it looks like 4 time steps or 15
minutes. This can be changed to hourly though be changing the variable
reporting in the IDF file.

 

Constructions will need to be defined in the IDF file, but there are a
great amount of constructions available in:

 

EnergyPlus\DataSets\ASHRAE_2005_HOF_Materials.idf 

 

.. for getting started with.

 

good luck, and head on over to the energplus support page.

I assume that this MRT discussion is about residential buildings with no dedicated perimeter heating and cooling system to maintain the temperatures of the inside surfaces of exterior walls and windows near the space temperature; and the supply locations of heating and cooling systems are well away from envelope.  
Modern office buildings, even in extreme hot and cold climates, tend to be 70% glass today because of the low first, construction, and maintenance costs and also because they create a pleasant indoor environment.  Today's glass efficiency is such that both heating and cooling systems of the perimeter zone (1' to 3") is by supplying conditioned air from the ceiling.  Baseboard radiation, even in Minneapolis where temperatures drop to -30F, is not necessary.  This frees up prime living space right up to the envelope without obstructions by HVAC units on the floor.  The effect of solar radiation through the glass on MRT comfort inside is dealt with blinds.  If the systems serving the perimeter fail, then the occupants have to leave the building since the windows are fixed shut to maintain inside pressure for fire and smoke control.  MRT is not a factor inside these buildings if the Std90 Wall and Roof U-factors apply and the glass U-factor is about 0.3.
I have had to look at the MRT conditions inside such buildings in order to determine how inefficient the envelope could be made and still maintain comfort conditions inside based on MRT.  This is a trial and error or iterative effort.  In DOE2.1E you can get hourly report for EXTERIOR-WALL, Variable List Number = 6 (outside surface temperature).  This information is not available for windows so an approximate value for outside surface temperature is the outdoor temperature assuming the glass outside surface is light-colored, smooth and low-heat absorbing.  Transfer this information to an Excel file and calculate inside surface temperatures and MRTs at different distance.  Surface temperatures of Space interior wall are assumed to be the Space design temperature.  Some programming is required and extreme theoretical accuracy is not required.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] interior wall with window adjacent to unconditioned area
Message-ID: <25F2BDB6656B8F40A1289ED906D6B5CF06D49A52@EXCHANGE1.cadd_group.ghtltd.com>

I have a general question about how to model and prove compliance for a
window in an interior wall that separates conditioned space from
unconditioned space.

 

We have a project where there is a conditioned area in the parking level
with a full height storefront window system separating the room from the
unconditioned garage.

 

As far as I know, this "wall" is actually an interior wall per ASHRAE
90.1-2004.  Or rather, it's not defined as an exterior wall (at least
clearly enough).  For certain modeling and compliance programs, you
can't even assign a window to an interior wall.  To further complicate
things, the entire wall is window, meaning there is no actual cavity
space for insulation (which proves difficult for things like Comcheck
compliance).

 

Does anyone know how ASHRAE 90.1 views this "wall".  Is it really an
exterior walls?  Are ALL walls that separate conditioned from
unconditioned space considered exterior walls?  If so, this is not
properly defined in ASHRAE.  And if not, there doesn't appear to be
anywhere that governs U-values for windows in INTERIOR walls that
separate conditioned from unconditioned area.  In fact, from what I can
tell, ASHRAE advises you to IGNORE windows in interior walls.  Which is
all fine, unless your entire wall is window.  But at the same time,
interior walls appear to require a maximum U-value of 0.120.  For a
window, this is nearly impossible.

 

Can anyone interpret 90.1 for me?  Am I really allowed to ignore windows
in interior walls even if they separate conditioned space from
unconditioned space?  

 

Thanks in advance!

Rachit,

 

You can make whatever modifications you want to your .idf file outside
of OpenStudio (in IDF Editor, text editor, etc.) and then bring them
into OpenStudio.  It will not overwrite any of your schedules, HVAC
equipment, etc.  If you even wanted to start with a full EP model you
have, you can open up that .idf file in OpenStudio, look at what the
geometry looks like currently, and change it however you want to within
OpenStudio.  Then you save all those geometry changes by saving the .idf
in OpSt, and you have the new geometry you wanted with the same HVAC,
lights, schedules, etc. you wanted to keep from before.  This is a
feature I really like about it - that it changes what you want to change
and leaves the rest alone.  On the flip-side, it's not a full-service
editor, so it requires you to also have another interface or be
comfortable with text to deal with HVAC/schedules.  The EP help group
and/or documentation can tell you more specifics or address any bug-type
problems you might be having, but I thought I'd answer the general
question since I've used it before.  Good luck!

You may want to post this question on the Energyplus support group page
or mailing list see below.

 

To hopefully answer some of your questions though the output file you
likely will want to view for your analysis is the .eso file and there is
a great viewer xEsoView that is free and is great for viewing these
outputs. To determine what variables are presented in the ESO file you
will need to add the variables from the RDD file to the IDF file if the
variables are not presently being reported. I believe you will need to
do this in the IDF editor, and if you have run the simulation once there
will be a drop down list of available variables in the IDF menu for
Reports:Variables.

 

I would recommend reporting the variables at the same timestep your
simulation is running in this case it looks like 4 time steps or 15
minutes. This can be changed to hourly though be changing the variable
reporting in the IDF file.

 

Constructions will need to be defined in the IDF file, but there are a
great amount of constructions available in:

 

EnergyPlus\DataSets\ASHRAE_2005_HOF_Materials.idf 

 

.. for getting started with.

 

good luck, and head on over to the energplus support page.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Open Studio: Rescheduling in E+

 

Hello

I have few queries regarding rescheduling in Open Studio. Also I am a
new user of Energy+. 

1. I produce basic building geometry in Sketchup and set the available
input data. One thing that I understand from this is that Open Studio
have very limited inputs. Also scheduling is automatically set for the
simulations. Then I run the E+ simulation within Sketchup. I want only
the zone comfort i.e. (MRT and MAT). The result in excel format have
temperatures within every 15 mins. But I want the hourly temperature
only. What I have to do for hourly result within sketchup? 

2. I want to take this process further. I want to edit the scheduling
and change the building materials. What I understand from this is that
sketchup help in setting the building coordinates easily. After setting
the building geometry in sketchup, can one edit the scheduling and other
related stuff that is taken default in open studio. The (.idf file)
produce in Open Studio while saving, can this (.idf file) after
rearranging the scheduling and changing material assembly in IPF Editor
work for further simulation analysis. Can this process be done? I tried
this but its giving errors. Hope I am able to explain my query. 

Please help me. 

Thanks 

Rachit

Message-ID: <017201c9c396$e2333fd0$a699bf70$@com>

I did some searching in the bldg-sim archives, and although I swear I saw
some discussion on this before, I wasn't able to find much, so sorry if
this is a repeat thread.

 

Let's just skip the whole approved modeling program discussion, because I
feel that has been beat to death already. What I want to know is:

 

1)      For the IRS EPACT 2005, which of course has been extended and
slightly modified recently, have any of you routinely been applying for
(and earning) tax credits for your clients? It is a lot of work to tweak
my existing models to the proper baselines, schedules, etc, and the few
projects I've looked at haven't even partially qualified. It seems
straight forward, but I'm not sure I've ever even talked to anyone who has
worked an application all the way through. Any major pitfalls to be aware
of?



2)      There is also the whole Interim Lighting Rule, which allows for
partial qualification if you reduce lighting power density to 25% below
ASHRAE 90.1-2001 prescribed levels (no model required according to the
EPACT amendments from Notice 2008-40). The current Seattle Energy Code
prescribes LPDs that are better than or equal to 90.1-2004, which is in
turn is about 20-30% (depending on the space type) more stringent than
90.1-2001. Have I just been missing the boat by not telling every client
that they should be right around that magic 25% reduction compared to
90.1-2001 and thus qualify for up to $0.60/sf tax credit. Again, I feel
like news of this would already be flying around town if everybody
automatically qualified, so what am I missing?

 

Any thoughts, experiences, or comments?

My apologies... I've just learned that I in fact have a more advanced version of the ASHRAE Standard-55 Comfort Model than has yet been approved and published by ASHRAE, and the current published version does not include the MRT calculation tool.

 

ASHRAE is due to provide an updated version of the tool in the near future, but the timing of that is presently unknown.

 

 

The current release of the IES Virtual Environment does, however, provide air temp, individual surface temperatures, MRT, dry resultant temp, DPT, moisture content, and RH for all simulation reporting intervals. These results from the dynamic thermal model, plus user inputs for occupant clothing level, activity level, and local air speed then provide occupant PPD, PMV, and Comfort Index for each simulation reporting interval. To assess comfort in close proximity to a glazed fa?ade vs. the middle of a larger space, users can sub-divide the space to create a smaller thermal zone adjacent to the fa?ade in question. 

 

Additional consideration are required to model the effects of transmitted short-wave radiation actually striking an occupant (see my prior post on this thread regarding asymmetrical thermal comfort involving transmitted short-wave radiation).

The ASHRAE Standard-55 Comfort Model (proper name) does allow for a single user input. However, immediately to the right of the MRT value, it also includes a "Calc" button that opens a separate dialog. In this separate dialog, the user can enter values for the following parameters:

 

Room dimensions

Occupant location

Occupant orientation (facing wall or azimuth)

Occupant position (seated or standing)

Temperature for each of four walls, ceiling, and floor

And dimensions, location, and temperature for a "window or panel" area within each of the four walls, ceiling, and floor.

 

I just sent a post with the actual MRT calculation dialog box (for those of you that receive visuals in your emails); however, it appears that the screen shot of the dialog was too big for the Bldg-Sim list serve.

 

The IES Virtual Environment also provides MRT, dry resultant temperature, and the full range of ASHRAE 55 thermal comfort input parameters and results (PPD, PMV, etc.) for a location in the center of the room, as well as surface temperature results for each individual surface in the model. These surface temperatures, for any given simulation time step, can then be readily entered into the ASHRAE Standard-55 Comfort Model above if one is interested in thermal comfort for a specific location within a rectangular room.

Karen,

 

The ASHRAE-55 Thermal Comfort Tool created by the UC Berkeley Center for the Built Environment and available from ASHRAE publications (if I recall correctly) includes a very easy-to-use MRT calculator for rectangular rooms. It allows for MRT at a particular position in that room, separate surface temperatures and dimensions for surfaces, and also the inclusion of a "panel" or other area within one of the walls (such as a cold/hot window, heating panel, etc.) that has a distinct temperature. This is part of a very handy tool for determining PPD, etc. based upon the typical range of human thermal comfort variables (clo value, activity level, air temp, MRT, humidity, air movement).

 

Cheers,

Timothy

Vikram,

 

     ? Does one person too hot near the window and another person too cold
on the inside equal thermal comfort ?

 

The danger with an ?averaged? parameter is the assumption that one single
parameter can measure the comfort properties of a room - yet alone for a
whole building ?  The daylighting people are trying to develop an
alternative to the ?daylight factor? ? they face the same issues.  We
probably need an annualised colour-coded plan view of thermal comfort ( even
visual comfort ) for the floor space ?

 

 

Tim,

 

Also see the book by Mark Bessoudo.    It seems he wrote a book about his
thesis.   He references the papers by Huizenga & Zhang

 

Building fa?ades and thermal comfort: The impacts of climate, solar shading,
and glazing on the indoor thermal environment

by Mark Bessoudo,

Editorial Reviews

 

There is currently a trend of designing new commercial buildings with large
glazed fa?ades. Maintaining comfort in the perimeter zones of these
buildings is difficult due to their transmittance of solar radiation and
exposure to cold outdoor air temperature. Designing these buildings with
high-performance fa?ades, however, can improve energy performance, provide a
high-quality thermal and visual environment, and reduce thermal loads. This
book presents an experimental and simulation study of the indoor thermal
environment of a perimeter zone office with glass fa?ade and solar shading
device. The study investigates the impact of climate, glazing type, and
shading properties on thermal comfort. By considering comfort as a key
consideration in building design from the initial design stage through to
building occupancy, it can be ensured that new high-performance and passive
solar buildings are, not only aesthetically pleasing and energy-efficient,
but also comfortable and enjoyable places to work and live.

Regarding asymmetrical thermal comfort and that involving transmitted
short-wave radiation, the following link will get you an excellent (lengthy,
detailed, and very helpful) paper on thermal comfort in proximity to
windows. It discusses the effects of glass surface temperatures and
transmission properties, along with possible options for including a rating
of thermal comfort performance on NFRC window labeling.

 

Huizenga, C., H. Zhang, P. Mattelaer, T. Yu, E. Arens, and P. Lyons, 2006.

Performance for Human Thermal Comfort. Final Report to the National
Fenestration Rating Council, Center for the Built Environment, University of
California, Berkeley, February.

 

You do not need an open window to have comfort issues associated with
transmitted short-wave radiation, nor does it have to be direct-beam
radiation?any window permitting occupants to receive a good dose of
transmitted diffuse and/or direct solar radiation is reason enough to care
about this effect. The paper at the CBE link above provides a very useful
means of estimating the contribution of both direct-beam and diffuse solar
radiation. The discussion of the impact of diffuse radiation begins on page
44 and the discussion of direct radiation starts on page 49.

 

 <http://www.cbe.berkeley.edu/research/briefs-thermmodel.htm> CBE?s Advanced
Thermal Comfort Model  

This tool can used to study the effectiveness of energy saving design
strategies, such as facade designs and advanced HVAC systems, in terms of
occupant comfort. 

In addition, the CBE has an Advanced Thermal Comfort model that they will be
happy to run for you as consultants to your project (and which their
industry partners also have direct access to) which takes into account
short-wave radiation striking a human subject, along with numerous very
detailed thermal comfort parameters. This tool was used for several key
sections of the paper linked above, so you can see examples of the model and
results there. Not only does this model account for occupant attributes like
body mass (along with the usual comfort parameters), it actually models 16
different human body parts and the constriction and dilation of blood
vessels that accompanies different thermo-physiological states. This model,
which is not really all that difficult to work with, has been used for CBE
consulting to the automotive industry and a in-house by handful of large A&E
firms. If you want to learn more, the following link takes you to the
section of the CBE web site describing this tool:

Ah, another can of worms. MRT is probably the least understood and certainly
the least calculated of space thermodynamics. ASHRAE RP 1383 was
specifically set up to calculate MRT for spaces, even having unusual
configurations. It should be ready in about 18 months or so? 

So Vikram, with reference to your analogy, how about this one?

Imagine a space that is naturally ventilated through an open window, at this
certain time of the day the occupant is in such a position that the suns
rays reach the occupant through the open window. What would the MRT be in
the space and how would this affect the occupants comfort.

It?s an interesting conundrum that the times that MRT becomes a significant
player in the comfort calculation is when there is an uneven radiant field
(hot or cold window; fireplace; thermal mass wall). In such a situation, is
it fair to average out the MRT for an entire room? Don?t your view factors
change drastically depending on your position in the room? 

 

Does one person too hot near the window and another person too cold on the
inside equal thermal comfort?

James,

 

See ASHRAE 90.1 Figure 5-5, and also definitions for unconditioned and
semi-heated spaces in Section 3.2 (look under Space). According to these
definitions, naturally or mechanically ventilated parking garages are not
considered to be enclosed spaces, so the wall between conditioned space and
garage in your project should be treated as exterior wall.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] interior wall with window adjacent to unconditioned area

 

I have a general question about how to model and prove compliance for a
window in an interior wall that separates conditioned space from
unconditioned space.

 

We have a project where there is a conditioned area in the parking level
with a full height storefront window system separating the room from the
unconditioned garage.

 

As far as I know, this "wall" is actually an interior wall per ASHRAE
90.1-2004.  Or rather, it's not defined as an exterior wall (at least
clearly enough).  For certain modeling and compliance programs, you can't
even assign a window to an interior wall.  To further complicate things, the
entire wall is window, meaning there is no actual cavity space for
insulation (which proves difficult for things like Comcheck compliance).

 

Does anyone know how ASHRAE 90.1 views this "wall".  Is it really an
exterior walls?  Are ALL walls that separate conditioned from unconditioned
space considered exterior walls?  If so, this is not properly defined in
ASHRAE.  And if not, there doesn't appear to be anywhere that governs
U-values for windows in INTERIOR walls that separate conditioned from
unconditioned area.  In fact, from what I can tell, ASHRAE advises you to
IGNORE windows in interior walls.  Which is all fine, unless your entire
wall is window.  But at the same time, interior walls appear to require a
maximum U-value of 0.120.  For a window, this is nearly impossible.

 

Can anyone interpret 90.1 for me?  Am I really allowed to ignore windows in
interior walls even if they separate conditioned space from unconditioned
space?  

 

Thanks in advance!

I also use both eQuest and EnergyPro and have found that the biggest 
(envelope) difference is that eQuest uses a "time value" (via thickness 
of most materials), whereas EnergyPro has preset assemblies that you 
choose from, none of which have multiple thermal components, just an 
R/U-Value. I assume this is why you are experiencing this difference.

I have asked questions about ASHRAE 62.1 on this list before, and I got 
some good guidance.  I am going to try again to see if anybody has any 
ideas about my current dilemma.

I am analyzing a circa 1999 dual duct VAV building with ASHRAE 62.1: 
2007.  I realize that the building was not, and may not, meet ASHRAE 
62.1:2007 requirements, but LEED Existing Buildings wants me to check.

Doing the analysis using the 62.1 spreadsheet, I can get it to pass but 
only if I increase the minimum cooling airflow to some conference rooms 
to 100% of design.  This basically makes the VAV system into a constant 
flow system in those rooms, and could over cool the conference rooms if 
they are unoccupied and the lights are off, but it could be OK if the 
rooms are full of people and in use. 

It occurs to me that a CO2 sensor (demand control ventilation) could be 
applied to such an instance, or possibly some sort of "occupancy 
control", but I cannot find any discussion of such controls in 62.1.

Question:  Has anyone had a similar problem getting an existing building 
to comply with ASHRAE 62.1?  Does anybody have a suggested solution?

NOTE:  I am using 62.1: 2007 by my own choice.  If this is a bad choice, 
and I should be using 62.1: 2004 instead, please let me know.


Thanks in advance for any thoughts you might be able to offer.

Found it!

ASHRAE 62.1: 2007 Section 6.2.7 "Dynamic Reset" seems to indicate that 
CO2 control is just fine.  If anybody has any advice on that, I'd love 
to hear it.


Cheers!

Message-ID: <661C97FF32444525BA272021F1B2EB7B@OmerLaptop>

Dear all,

I am stuck with the following problem in eQuest: I am trying to modell a residential building with a number of flats in each floor, however, in the middle of the building, there are duplex flats, meaning that a flat stretches on two floors. So for example on the 3rd floor we would have 5 flats + half of a duplex flat, and on the 4th floor we would have again 5 flats + the other half of the duplex flat. 

I would like to model each flat in the building as a zone. How should I do this now?

Thanks.

Hello Omer,

 

eQuest mainly cares about surface areas and the proximity of spaces does not
matter.  You could model the flats having multiple floors as one large flat
on one floor.  You need to be sure that the surface areas where there is
heat conduction are preserved.  This could make the 3D image look a bit
wonky but the numerical results should be fine.

The eQUEST results module does not currently enable you to compare more 
than 13 runs at once, regardless of whether your project is in wizard or 
detailed mode.  However, results for all runs are written to a CSV file 
(<project dir & name> - Parms.csv) so you can pull this file into Excel 
or other applications to review ALL run differences there.

Thank you Scott:

I looked at the project subdirectory and found all 18 CSV in separate
files.  I guess we must be in detailed edit mode to create a parametric
run, then we can get all of them in one CSV file..

All,

Does anyone know if I can split up an eQ model for LEED USGBC. There are a
total of 10 buildings (low rise) in a resort. The buildings do not shade
each other and also have no interactive effects (as they are on district
cooling).

I am thinking of making two models of 5 buildings each and then adding up
the results and presenting them in the format USGBC desires.

I have checked the earlier CIRs and cant seem to find a precedent. Any
thoughts?

Thanks

Dear Scott:

Yes indeed, I found the Parms.csv file with all the 18 strategies.  I
mannually added a column at the end of the spreadsheet to calculat the
total accumulative $ savings.  Great success,

Thank you for your clear guidance.

I will try next Mr. Eldrige advise to get the eQuest graphics by runing
9 strategies first then use the ninth run as a basecase for the
following nine strategies.

Thank you all for your help.

In general you can combine multiple buildings into one model or model each
separately and add up the results for a single LEED submission.  Two models
of 5 buildings each would be fine for most projects.

Depending upon the project's registration date and version of LEED you may
have to apply the DES modeling protocol found on the USGBC web site.  If so
you may need to model each building separately to demonstrate that each
meets the 14% savings minimum without the DES.

All,

Does anyone know if I can split up an eQ model for LEED USGBC. There are a
total of 10 buildings (low rise) in a resort. The buildings do not shade
each other and also have no interactive effects (as they are on district
cooling).

I am thinking of making two models of 5 buildings each and then adding up
the results and presenting them in the format USGBC desires.

I have checked the earlier CIRs and cant seem to find a precedent. Any
thoughts?

Thanks

Abaza,

The 'kill-a-watt' is probably the cheapest household wattmeter out there, http://www.amazon.com/P3-International-P4400-Electricity-Monitor/dp/B00009MDBU/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1240766534&sr=8-1

but it doesn't record hourly info, just current wattage, voltage, etc, and total kWh used since it was plugged in. and no memory - if it loses power, it's gone.

somewhat fancier is the 'watts up', http://cableorganizer.com/electricity-power-meter/
with the better models having memory and even internet connectivity.

fancier yet are some whole-house models like: http://www.bluelineinnovations.com/

hope that helps,
cramer

Dear all:

 

I have recently come across a European energy simulation program called
'IDA Indoor Climate and Energy 3.0' (http://www.equa.se/ice/intro.html).
The program seems to have undergone some rigorous validation efforts and
its modular structure looks quite attractive for advanced users and
researchers. Has anybody on this list used it and could you share your
impressions and how capable the tool is in modeling complex systems and
geometries? Are there any mature GUIs and comprehensive libraries
available for the tool? Thank you.

Dear Christoph,

I have been working for the last years with IDA ICE 3.0. You can find
quite a lot of information in the following report

apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/tools_directory/pdfs/contrasting_the_cap
abilities_of_building_energy_performance_simulation_programs_v1.0.pdf

There have been several validation tests. You can always contact Equa
(the company that have developed IDA ICE 3.0); they can probably help
you with your questions. Additionally, there is a new version of IDA ICE
(4) soon to be released that includes a new window model based on the
ISO standard 15099.

Hope this helped a bit

Best regards,

Harris

Hi,

 

I am also interested in hearing about the capabilities of IDA ICE, in
particular whether its plant modelling capabilities are as good as they
look on the website.  I've been using EnergyPlus to do some plant
modelling recently and it seems that while it works fine for fairly
standard systems, as soon as you try to simulate something a bit novel
it struggles and often fails to converge.  How does ICE's plant
modelling compare to something like TRNSYS?

 

Regards,

 

Andy

Not sure if this is for permanent or temporary (research purposes).  If the latter, Onset (www.onsetcomp.com) makes some multi-circuit data loggers for power monitoring.  Also Dent instruments.

As far as low-cost monitoring of HVAC compressors, I have had good look by simply monitoring amps (say a snapshot of amp draw every 90 seconds), and combining w/ a one-time measurement of voltage and power factor.  On a daily basis, the average of all those amperage measurements works out to a good estimate of daily kWh within a percent or two (I've had a couple of opportunities to cross-check against actual daily kWh).  It's much cheaper (both in terms of equipment costs and installation time) to track amperage than actual kWh or watts.

Thank you all; till now, I could not find a stand alone system that measures
the Kwh for multi circuits control panel. The HOBO system can do that, but
only by tweaking the system and having many extra equipment (cost will be
over $7,000.00). I do not know why I could not digest the idea that a multi
circuit Kwh monitoring system does not exist!

measurement of just amps is not a good idea in most areas we have worked

within, especially in residential districts.  For utilities in CA the
voltage variations

are too significant to get a result within a few percent. Differential
compressor

loading during the day also causes some variation in power factor.  Best to

measure true power if you want better than +-20%.

Could any one help in recommending a multi circuit sub-meter to monitor
energy consumption in houses. and also low-cost submeters to monitor the
HVAC compressor electric consumption (since I need many of them).
Thank you

Subject: [Bldg-sim] CEM Studying Material
Message-ID: <49F769D1.4090101@elfstrom.com>

I wrote the CEM exam on Friday after taking the 5-day workshop. The 
workshop note handout package contains all of the information to answer 
about 80-90% of the questions. I brought a couple of other books into 
the exam with me and used them for about three questions. I found the 
workshop to be well worth the time and money investment.

For self-study the Guide to Energy Management 6th ed 
Capehart/Turner/Kennedy is very appropriate. It goes into more depth 
than what is needed on the exam. They actually gave us a copy of this 
book at the workshop.

There's also the online practice test which you should definitely do if 
you're not taking the 5-day workshop.

I did a 3-day crash course private study group for my LEED AP exam too. 
I would say the LEED exam is slightly harder than the CEM exam, but in 
both cases you have to be prepared.

Dear Chistoph,
Working with DAYSIM from 2 year? take a critical look on daylighting factor. Could you give more detail about " temperate climate and mostly overcast" where it does accurate you mention on your presentation?

Dear colleagues:

 

It might be a complete 'faux pas' to send a design sequence based on
rules of thumb to a building simulation mailing list. But, I take the
risk. We recently developed and validated a rules-of-thumb based design
sequence for diffuse daylighting:
http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/people/faculty/reinhart/documents/DiffuseDayl
ightingDesignSequenceTutorial.pdf. The series offers design advice for
daylighting at the programming and massing stage and - being based on
the daylight factor  - applies to climates with either mostly diffuse
sky conditions or heavily obstructed sites. Alternatively, the design
sequence can be used in combination with a direct shading study. The
supporting research can be found at
http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/people/faculty/reinhart/documents/DiffuseDayl
ightingDesignSequenceInLRT.pdf.

Hi all,

In E+, ASHRAE standard 90 (App. G)  and in some other places, fan power  for VAV systems with variable speed drives is modeled as a given function of part load ratio. I think the theory behind this originally comes from BLAST. This must be based on assumptions for the shape of the fan efficiency curve and on the pressure characteristic and control of the VAV system. Does anyone have access to the original theory on this? Alternatively, can anyone explain why and when the "single curve for all fans and systems" approach works?

Best regards,

Per Sahlin

Dear Per Sahlin,
 
The simple fact is that fans which unload (those with variable inlet vanes ,
VSDs, etc.) do so in a way that is fairly represented by a curve.  The
generic curves found in most energy analysis programs are reasonable
representations of the unloading characteristics.  It is a good idea to have
a library of typical curves if your energy analysis program of choice
doesn't have such a library.
 
For a new building where your only purpose is to compare a "baseline" to
your specific design, it's reasonable to use a generic curve.  This is
because the actual operating conditions are not known for new construction;
you know only the designer's best calculation, not the "as built"
conditions.
 
For an existing building where you want to establish a model that represents
the actual conditions as closely as possible, it's probably worth developing
specific, custom curve coefficients for the installed fan(s).

Dear all,

a few years ago I was checking which program to use for my PhD research. I
ended up with 3: TRNSYS, IDA-ICE and ESP-r. I was used to TRNSYS, but did
want to check the others before making a final choice.
I tested IDA-ICE, and my aim was to model both existing and non-existing
plant systems in a given building. The main issue was that IDA_ICE is not
open-source. And however Per and his collegues are willing to help, it
remains commercial software developped and maintained by a small commercial
company. I finally opted for ESP-r, because of its active development
community. The mian thing is that you have to go into the code, but that
will be the case for all non-standard plant simulations. Unless the
hydraulics are not important. In that case you could easily work out a
model using the equation writers in TRNSYS.

Hope that helps,

Leen

Dear All:

I didn't use TRNSYS, IDA-ICE or ESP-r before, so that i am asking a question:

Can any one of these softwares simulate an outdoor env. (buildings, plants,
materials ...) same time it can simulate the indoor env., i.e. to generate an
outdoor meteorology to be used as an ambient for thermal and energy analysis in
buildings?

Any guide would be appreciated.

Regards,
Mohamad.

I've been trying to think of a "cheap" option for logging legacy meters 
(i.e. those with no inherent logging). My concept was to use a wireless 
CCTV network to take "stills" at set time intervals from the meter.
Issues to think about:
- Even a cheap setup with 2 x cameras will cost $200 + then there's the 
network cost (a cheap laptop perhaps)
- Processing the stills could be time consuming. However, a clever 
person with some scripting knowledge and OCR software could speed things 
up. Or, using a junior could render the stills into a useful spreadsheet 
format at minimal cost.
- Picture quality - if the cameras use their own lamp it is likely to 
glare. This could be overcome with a polarising filter perhaps.
- The range of inputs is limited to those displayed on the meter itself

The reason for investigating this is because calibrated energy models 
are becoming more popular on older buildings as a means of identifying 
potential energy savings.

Cypress Envirosystems is moving in this direction. They have a wireless
gauge reader that is indeed a camera that reads the needle for you. This
is for pressure gauges, but it seems like it might be adaptable to other
types. Here's their web site:

Is anyone aware of a CIR or received approval for using vacancy lighting sensors on a LEED project.  Meaning the sensor works like an occupancy sensor but does not turn lights on until the user flips the switch.  Then the lights automatically turn off after sensing no occupancy for a time.  If so, what is the approved percentage deduction off of light power density.  I was assuming an additional 10% over regular occupancy sensors but have been told the savings could really be a lot higher than that.  Thanks.

I forwarded the electric sub-meter discussion to The Energy Detective.
They produce low-cost data-loggers with wireless displays specifically
for home use and other buildings with one or two circuit panels 200 amps
or less. Here is their reply:

Hi Bill,
In reading the email chain, it does seem that TED with Footprints is
exactly what they are looking for, as it will log energy-usage data
every second.  You also have the ability to profile any load (greater
than 1kW), so that you could see WHEN the HVAC ran, HOW LONG it ran, and
WHAT IT COST to run.
We will also be introducing a new model of TED in the next couple of
weeks...TED 5000.  This model of TED will have a built-in web server and
a wireless display.  We'll be publishing specs/pricing late next week or
beginning of following....so please check for updates.
Thanks very much for your inquiry....please let us know if there are any
specific questions.

Best regards,
TED Support

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Electric sub-meter

I've been trying to think of a "cheap" option for logging legacy meters 
(i.e. those with no inherent logging). My concept was to use a wireless 
CCTV network to take "stills" at set time intervals from the meter.
Issues to think about:
- Even a cheap setup with 2 x cameras will cost $200 + then there's the 
network cost (a cheap laptop perhaps)
- Processing the stills could be time consuming. However, a clever 
person with some scripting knowledge and OCR software could speed things

up. Or, using a junior could render the stills into a useful spreadsheet

format at minimal cost.
- Picture quality - if the cameras use their own lamp it is likely to 
glare. This could be overcome with a polarising filter perhaps.
- The range of inputs is limited to those displayed on the meter itself

The reason for investigating this is because calibrated energy models 
are becoming more popular on older buildings as a means of identifying 
potential energy savings.

Message-ID: <3EC944427F87D84793DBBC4137A2B5ADD29E8B@to1exc02wp.halsall.com>

Hi All,
 
I assume that neither ASHRAE 90.1 ECB or Appendix G allow you to take
credit for shading due to surrounding buildings.  Can anyone provide a
specific reference to the code or LEED Reference Guide where that is
stated?  I understand the rationale for a single building, but if I'm
working on a campus with single ownership and the buildings have a 30
year contract to be owned and operated, I feel like I should be allowed
to take a credit for reducing the solar heat gains due to adjacent
buildings.  Any thoughts?
 
Thanks,

FYI:

You'll need conversion factors to go from steam to gas (or fuel) at the utility meter. Such factors can vary by load, boiler, etc. There is information in this
in the upcoming ASHRAE Performance Metric Protocols, ASHRAE Guideline 14-2002, and the papers below:
