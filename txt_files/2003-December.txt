Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Increased R value Credit for Concrete and Themal Massing
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200312021119.AA1908750pd80000501894@gard.com>

Dear Folks

Has anyone explored the increased R value credits for thermal massing for example Dow T-Mass etc. and can one simply increase the R value to the 'effective R value while changing the mass in DOE.  I would like some more background on this credit with 3rd party validation

Thanks

With your project open, click the "Project & Site" button on the navigation
bar.  Select the component tree tab in the project tree (If the project tree
is not showing, go to "View" on the top toolbar and select "Project Tree").
You should now see folders for "Hourly Reports" and "Hourly Report Blocks"
in the tree.  Double-clicking on an existing report or block allows you to
edit that component.  Right-clicking should bring up an option to create a
new component.  The detail screens look very similar to PowerDOE report and
block screens.

Hope this helps.

Please excuse the cross-postings...
 
Dear colleague,
 
This is your opportunity to influence future developments of daylight
simulation tools.
 
You are invited to participate in an online survey on the current use of
daylight simulation tools during building design. The survey is carried out
as part of a research project of the International Energy Agency's Task 31,
Daylighting Buildings in the 21st Century.The survey is administered by the
National Research Council Canada and will be active until Tuesday, December
23rd 2003. The outcome of the survey will be used to: 
?        identify existing weaknesses of daylighting design software
packages 
?        better understand design practitioners' needs 
?        tailor the output of tools accordingly. 
 
We would like you to fill out an online questionnaire about your daylighting
design experience. Please respond to all questions as openly and honestly as
possible. There are no right or wrong answers; it is only your opinion that
is important. All information that we obtain from you through this survey
will be kept confidential. Your participation in this research is voluntary.
Should you decide to participate in the survey, you still reserve the right
to end your participation at any time and for any reason, without prejudice.

 
If you are interested in participating in this survey, please go to
<http://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ie/light/survey.html>
http://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ie/light/survey.html. Thank you in advance for
your participation.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200312020404.AA0442359pd80000501457@gard.com>

Jim:

Five or six years ago we developed a (gas and oil-fired) boiler model that had 
detailed combustion and heat transfer modelling. It needed geometrical 
information that was generally available from manufacturers and was validated 
against an extensive testing programme at BSRIA in the UK. It's more focused on 
modelling specific boilers and needs less empirical coefficients than the 
Primary Toolkit model and was written up in HVAC&R 3(2) 1997.

The original code was wrapped into a TRNSYS Type and therefore could be combined 
with a load circuit and controls to simulate long term operation. The researcher 
who worked on this with me left some while ago, and I haven't done much with the 
code since. It may be possible to dust this off if there was enough interest: it 
would certainly be capable of addressing all four of the issues. The original 
work was funded by a UK Research Council.

I've been looking for info on this subject for some time, with little
success. There seems to be lots of testing of combustion efficiency, but
little info on jacket losses and off cycle stack losses. Which makes it
difficult to create accurate DOE-2 boiler curves. But DOE-2's default
curves, and in fact the whole boiler simulation model, is, in my opinion,
not particularly accurate.

I'll be very interested in what you can find out.

  TC 4.7 has been approached with a request for an insight, studies,
articles, or other sources that could assist them in developing tools,
intended for gas customer use, to estimate:
           1.  Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency or Seasonal Boiler
Efficiency
           2.  Cycling losses
           3.  Fuel savings of lowering the operating steam pressure
           4.  Efficiency reduction due to oversized boilers

  This is an area that doesn't seem to get discussed much in the building
energy arena.  I am interested to see what develops.  Please share anything
you know.

Isn't the generally used unit for throttling range - deg F or Deg C? But
in the 'zone parameters window' it asks for the input in deg R...??? Is
this the Rankine scale, which as I understand, is virtually never used
in scientific research these days.  
Also when I look at the BDL file generated by eQUEST it shows -
"THROTTLING-RANGE = 0.2500 R"
Is this an error or am I not understanding it correctly?
Thanks.

First, thank you for the information!

I think, James F. Dolan was looking for kBtu/sf/yr (annual energy
consumption). 
We have got information at
http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cbecs/public_use.html, ( 1999 Commercial
Buildings Energy Consumption Survey: Consumption and Expenditures
Tables).
Also, we are studying offices consumption in Spain.

Now, we would like use the "climate zone : 45-year average, Table C1.
Total Consumption by Major Fuel, 1999", with Spain cities heating degree
day. But in Spain we use heating degree day base 15?C (Gd 15/15). We
have values using this base.

Do you have the values of "Climate zone. TableC1. Total Consumption by
Major Fuel, 1999", calculated with base 15?C (Gd 15/15)?
Could we get this information?

Thank you.
Kind regards,
Jaume Arqu?s

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200312191030.AA3059765pd80000527801@gard.com>

Thanks for all the information I received.  The questions about the
vertical height limits used in closed piping systems for tall buildings,
the alternative locations for pumps and equipment in piping systems, and
determining the number of and location of mechanical floors came up when
viewing piping riser diagrams at a graduate course at IIT-Chicago. 300
psi is equivalent to 690 ft (about 50 floors), but plate & frame HX's
can be designed for higher pressures up to 450 psi (over 1000 ft).
Shell & tube HXs are designed for even higher pressures so why not break
the piping system every 1000 ft with a HX when pumping say district CHW
up to cooling coils at say 2000 ft.  The riser diagram that I presented
to the class was based on a real project and showed plate & frame HXs
and the pump location on the discharge side of the HX.  I was hoping to
find published literature on this topic and on piping systems design for
high-rise buildings in general explaining the pros & cons of different
piping arrangements.  

 

Riser diagrams and equipment schedules on HVAC, Plumbing & Fire
Protection drawings identify most of the energy consuming products in
the base building with a few exceptions such as elevators.  All energy
consuming products in the building and their operating profiles have to
be entered as input into energy programs to get the correct electrical
demand costs.  Is there any interest in developing a teaching design
manual for graduate courses in "Energy Efficient Building Design" and
"Energy Codes & Code Compliance"?  The manual would be developed with
the support of architectural-engineering design firms and would
emphasize case studies of different types of buildings.

Varkie, 

I certainly agree with what Eric states.  Plate-frame
heat exchangers are probably not the best choice for
high pressure applications.  In addition, look out for
pressure drop if you are trying to stuff a lot of
water through a few plates.  

Pump location really doesn't matter except that you
have to watch out for what is called "net positive
suction head" or "NPSH".  Basically, if you put the
pump suction in a low pressure situation
(intentionally or unintentionally) you can tear up the
pump with cavitation.

Hello:
 
We've got data on lots of pumps...including the REJ building, where the
whole physical plant was put up 2 stories in the air to reduce pumping
power, and the cooling towers placed directly on top of the plant to further
reduce pumping energy, or at least this was the design intent.

Subject: [bldg-sim] Pump location



I am looking for information (articles, research papers, case studies) on
the effect of the location of the pump relative to a plate and frame heat
exchanger in a closed piping system.  Some of the issues are (1) the
vertical height of the piping system (1000' to 2000'), how high can you go,
(2) pumping thru HX, (3) pumping away from HX, (4) pump and HX located at
bottom of system, (5) pump and HX at top of system, and (6) pump start up.
What are the issues when the HX is replaced with other equipment such as
chillers and boilers?

The standard TRNSYS library includes all the components you need to 
simulate such a system, from the multizone building (Type 56) to the 
solar collector (Type 71 for evacuated tube collectors) to the 
absorption machine (Type 7).

Some non-standard components are also available from TESS if you need 
more flexibility to simulate the absorption cooling machine. You can 
find more information on the TESS libraries on the TRNSYS website: 
http://sel.me.wisc.edu/trnsys
(go to "component models", you will find a list of available Types and a 
link to TESS)

Kind regards,

Hi all, and appologies for cross posting

I want to model a building with solar absorption cooling system. 
Has anyone developped a TRNSYS type for such systems, or in a more simple way, is there information on the way to calculate or cuurent values of the efficiency of an absorption cooling system .

  Our company, Gas Natural SDG, S.A.,  has been working in the energy area for many years ago. The headquarters are in Barcelona (Spain), but we are working around the world (Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Marocco, Italy,...).  Now, we are looking for the value of specific energie in office buildings.

  Anybody knows the ratio kWh/m2 (or BtuIT/ft2), for offices buildings?(it depensd of the clima). If not, could you give to us how to get it? or any information relationed?

Hi,
I am running eQUEST 3.37 and somehow neither of the
economics report are printed in the SIM file. I
verified this thinking that non hourly report for
economics were not selected by going to the properties
for non hourly reports, and selected the desired
verifications and summary reports.
This haven?t worked, I tried inputting the reporting
commands directly into the INP and BDL files and I am
still haven?t manage to print the economics report in
the SIM file.
Does anyone know about this problem or in another
matter is it possible to RUN eQUEST BDL directly from
Text pad or command prompt.

Ian,

The DOE Building America program has been working for the last year or so to establish a definition for a Benchmark House that can be used to calculate savings from the houses affected by the program. The kind of information you are looking for has been addressed in this document. http://www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/building_america/pdfs/benchmark_def_ver3.pdf

I am trying to figure out how much heat each particular appliances in

that consumed energy by each appliance is given off to the surrounding air.
If anyone has an idea of where I could obtain this information, I would

We (Wrightsoft) are trying to assemble a set of residential building 
descriptions that represent the common house types found in the U. S.  The 
goal is to provide our Right-Suite Residential users with example projects 
for the house types they are likely to encounter.

Is anyone aware of a systematic categorization of the U.S. housing 
stock?   Ideally, we would want some example floor plans for each 
type.  Note that we don't need detailed statistics on the population or 
regional distribution of each type ... the question is more one of "field

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Response to my posting on "Are there publicly available schedules for  ASHRAE 90.1 calculations ?"
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200312111929.AA291531pd80000516453@gard.com>

I received 12 responses to my posting yesterday on the availability of ASHRAE 90.1 schedules. Since almost all of them were sent directly to me, I want to summarize for the other readers of BLDG-SIM what I learned:

1. To my surprise, I learned that post-1999 versions of ASHRAE 90.1 no longer require the use of default schedules for internal conditions, with the only caveat that the same schedules for lights, internal gains, occupancy, etc., are used consistently in the simulations for the reference and the designed building. This suits me fine, since I have already defined schedules for the demonstration building that are probably more representative of typical office conditions in China than those in the 1999 and previous versions of ASHRAE 90.1

2. For those still interested in the old, i.e.,  1989,  ASHRAE 90.1 default schedules, these are available from several sources :  (1) in EnergyPlus format in the data sets released with the EnergyPlus program, (2) in VisualDOE (don't know how extractable), (3) in COMCheck (please contact LIU, Bing at PNNL for details  Bing.liu at pnl.gov).

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] heat rejection question
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200312110904.AA0430484pd80000515606@gard.com>

I'm modeling a condenser loop with eQuest. The chiller condenser pump powers
the loop and the fluid cooler pump acts as a recirculation pump. The loop
net load includes the heat from both pumps (115534 btu/h), but the cooling
tower load doesn't seem to reject heat from the recirculation pump (62604
btu/h). Could anyone help me understand how DOE calculates the heat rejected
by the cooling towers ? Why the recirculation pump heat is considered in the
loop net load but is not rejected ?

Professor,
How are you?
I am not fimiliar with Radiance and some of the Glare
issues it has. I found a method of calculating Glare
constant using the 'cornell formula' and then
subsequently getting a glare index out of it.
I dont know if this algorithm has been validated or if
it is widely used as a practise for glare or DGI
calculations.
I will also write to Amarpreet about this.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200312102022.AA2231515pd80000514756@gard.com>

BLDG-SIM denizens,

I have a fairly complete DOE-2 model for a soon-to-be completed US-China demonstration energy-efficient office building in Beijing that I've used since 2000 to track the evolution of the design and evaluate proposed energy-efficiency improvements.  What I need to do now is to do an ASHRAE 90.1 simulation to document how much the demo building exceeds ASHRAE 90.1 for LEED certification. I first thought of keyboarding in the occupancy, internal loads, lighting and equipment loads, etc. from the ASHRAE standards, but then thought that someone must have done that already. Furthermore, I was worried about getting some of the input parameters wrong.   Does anyone know of any ready-to-use DOE-2 input fragments for ASHRAE 90.1 calculations that are publicly available ?  

Joe Huang

Following is a picture of the building, which is slated to be completed in mid-January 2004.

Could anyone tell me how to calculate sky glare and
reflective glare for offices. The only lighting tool I
have is Lumen Micro, and there is no direct way of
getting these results.
What are the other hand-calc resources? I dont have
the IESNA handbook and need to get this done quick.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200312101648.AA4839765pd80000514446@gard.com>

I have been trying to import window5 files  (glass assemblies) to eQUEST,
but I seem to be having problems. I used the report function in window, and
saved it in the eQUEST window directory. Problem is, every time I try to
import it, it gives me an error message saying "Invalid U-value Conditions -
likely due to non-NFRC conditions being specified in the Window program."
The file I was trying to export was a glazing system assembly from Window5,
and I checked - it had the NFRC environmental condition.
Has anyone else had a similar problem? If so, what can I do to correct it?

Thanks

Brian:
 
I was taught a trick by an old dog, Mr.. Bruce Birdsall of Lawrence Berkeley
Labs, who was in on the original creation of DOE-2. along with Fred
Winkleman, Jeff Hirsch, and Fred Buhl. HELLO to all of these people.
 
Bruce told me to use an induction system in the guest rooms (I was heavily
into Hilton Hotels at the time). Such a system allowed primary and secondary
heating and cooling coils, and by using  the bypass ratio, allowed outside
air to entrain. I don't have time to research the exact bypass ration, or
all the stuff I did (it was in DOE-2.1C version).
 
But that would allow you to use outside air with virtually a fan coil
system, either two or four pipe. Then the corridor air is on it's own loads
and system.
 
Try it.

I am using eQUEST to model a high-rise multi-unit residential building (in a

2-pipe fan coils (with a supplementary electric coil) in the suites and a
corridor make-up air unit.  The in-suite fan coils under consideration have
an outdoor air intake and an air-to-air heat exchanger to recover heat from
the suite washroom exhaust.  This is not how the FC fan coil system is set
up in DOE 2.2 - and there is no provision for heat recovery at the fan-coil
level.  I am using the OA-FROM-SYS keyword which moves the entire
ventilation load to the corridor make-up air system where heat recovery can
be applied.  Doing this appears to greatly improve the energy performance of
the building.  I am wondering if modeling the system in this was is
over-stating performance of the heat recovery.

 

I am wondering if there is experience within the group to better model such
a system.  Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

There was a thesis done at Lund Institute of Technology, in Sweden in 1997,
that discussed typical load shapes in 6 categories of Swedish commercial
buildings.  The thesis is written by C. Noren, Department of Heat and Power
Engineering, Division of Energy Economics and Planning, Lund, Sweden.  The
results are also reported in "Energy and Buildings", Vol. 28, Number 3,
1998.  I came across this work when I was working on ASHRAE RP-1093
(Compilation of Diversity Factors and Schedules for Energy and Cooling Load
Calculations), at Texas A&M few years ago.

It may not be Northeastern US, but you can find interesting data on energy use for various buildings types in Canada from the OEE site:

http://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/publications/infosource/home/index.cfm?act=category&category=03&PrintView=N&Text=N

Specifically, section 10.2 of the COMMERCIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL BUILDING ENERGY USE SURVEY 2000 (CIBEUS) Detailed Statistical Report, December 2002(http://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/neud/dpa/energy_consumption_intensity.cfm?PrintView=N&Text=N) may be useful to you as it crosses regions with building types for total energy use (Obvious reminder: large parts of Atlantic, Quebec and Ontario 'regions' are quite similar in climate to NE US). Hope this helps!

Mornin' Jim

You should check out Itron/RER eShapes on our website.  You can download free end use load shapes for a variety of commercial building prototypes and heating/cooling fuel combinations:

http://www.rer.com/Online/eshapes.htm

The free shapes are available on the regional basis, shown in the map attached to this link:
http://www.rer.com/eshapes/map.htm


As described on the website, we also offer residential and industrial shapes, and we can also do custom applications (i.e. state level, shapes for specific end uses on, etc.).

The only caveat is that eShapes results are presented as kWh (electric) and kBtu (gas), so you would have to convert the kWh if you are interested in overall energy use in kBtu/sf/yr.

If you receive any other useful reference sources that aren't posted back to the group, could you please do so?

Thanks and good luck!

Sincerely,

Bob Ramirez

Could anyone tell me how to calculate sky glare and
reflective glare for offices. The only lighting tool I
have is Lumen Micro, and there is no direct way of
getting these results.
What are the other hand-calc resources? I dont have
the IESNA handbook and need to get this done quick.

Dear list members, 

I have had a small discussion with fellow list member Chip Barnaby on the word 'hygric'. Translating from my native language, Dutch, hygric would be the correct word to indicate anything 'pertaining to moisture'. However, hygric does not appear in the ASHRAE terminology book, handbook of fundamentals, etc. 

So.... can anyone tell me whether this a difference between UK and US English, or....? Should one use the term, or is it unknown in a large part of the world? Any suggestions on synonyms? 

Best regards,

Mark,
 I presume that you are using eQuest. Somehow your files are
showing .txt as an extension. i.e the files look like
Elec.GRT.TXT. If you change this file to Elec.GRT it should
work. Attached are the files with right extension and you
can see the files on Wizard screen 1.

It appears as though the PTAC cooling coil routine in DOE2.1E is overestimating latent load on the coil.  
 
As shown by the lines of DOE2.1E code listed below, the sensible load is calculated via an averaged supply air temperature (TS), which is derived from the zone load and temperature.  Since the PTAC cooling coil runs either fully on or fully off, the value of TS in a part-load condition becomes a time weighted average between the temperature of the air off the cooling coil in the ON mode and the mixed air temperature. I believe this is all correct.
 
      IF(PO .GT. 0.0)                                                           PTAC   150
     1TS     = TAVE - <QNOW>/(CONS(1)*<CFMAX>*LSR(1))                           PTAC   151
     .
     .
     .
C              CALC UNIT COOLING LOAD.                                          PTAC   209
    7 CONTINUE                                                                  PTAC   210
      ZQC    = AMAX1(0., (TM-TS)*CONS(1)*FC)                                    PTAC   211
C              THEN ANY MOISTURE REMOVAL INCREASES THE LOAD                     PTAC   212
      ZQC    = ZQC + AMAX1(0.,WM-WCOIL)*CONS(2)*FC                              PTAC   213

The latent load, however, is calculated from the ON mode leaving coil moisture value with no adjustment for the off-time in a given hour. I would expect that an adjustement such as the following line would be needed to only allow latent load for the time that the coil is on.
 
      IF (DTMC.GT.0) ONTIME = (TM-TS)/(TM-TC)

Am I missing something here?  I think I can fix the problem with a function, but I want to make sure I'm not mistaken that it is a problem.
 
Thanks,

My Ph.D thesis " An Integrated Design and Control Strategy for Energy 
Efficient Buildings, April 2002" discussed the relations between thermal mass " 
sensible and latent thermal mass", thermal insulation, solar radiation, and 
controlled natural ventilation. In this research I used Energy-Plus to test a house 
very similar to steve's house in Blacksburg, Virginia. The house was designed 
and built by Professor Yvan Beliveau (Virginia Tech.). I also collected field 
data for the house. 
In summary, Internal thermal mass is a heat storage. If free heat source (or 
cooling source) is available, e.g from windows during warm days in winter or 
ventilation during cool nights in summer, then, thermal mass is useful. But if 
no free heat source is available, then, thermal mass may hurt since it will 
store the heat from the active heating or cooling system, especially when using 
more than one temperature set point for the active air conditioning.
The other half of the story, which is utilizing the latent thermal mass, is 
introduced and  thoroughly investigated for the first time in this research. I 
can e-mail this thesis in PDF file to any one who is interested in this 
subject.

The house is not instrumented, so all performance monitoring is by direct observation and utility bills (I work at home, so I can watch it closely).  However, I would be happy to volunteer this house for such a study.....

Other noteworthy features:
1)  The underslab hot water lines are all insulated.  This allows one to draw water in a kitchen or bathroom, and then draw water again 5-10 minutes later and still have it hot.  That's especially convenient when cooking and cleaning up, and ensures that each dishwasher draw is hot.  As a result, the water heater temperature can be lowered.

2)  All lights that can utilize the 110V screw-in solid-state fluorescents are retrofitted with them.  Approximately 30 can lights use the 15W fluorescents.  They work beautifully, once you get used to the 1 minute warm-up.  Other ceiling fixtures use the 13W corkscrew type bulb.  It's nice not constantly reminding the kids to turn off the lights.  The biggest problem is educating the rest of the family about the lights.  They keep turning off the brighter fluorescent fixtures, and turning on some of the dimmer decorative incandescent fixtures; thinking they are saving energy.

  Steve,

  Are you monitoring the indoor and outdoor temperatures at your new house ?  I would be interested to see if these corroborate what one would get modeling the house with a simulation program.  When I did some analysis for a CIEE project about 8 years ago to design a house for California transition climates that would not require air-conditioning, the analysis showed modest improvements in peak indoor temperatures with increased insulation beyond Title-24 requirements (which are R-19 wall, R-38 ceiling, U-0.65/0.40SHGC windows in your area anyway), but dramatic drops as the amount of thermal mass is increased.  Since we're in earthquake country, I did not consider masonry walls, but rather thicker or even multiple layers of sheetrock, plus exposing half of the floor slab (assuming that the other half will be covered by furniture, rugs, etc.).  The combined effect was good, but I'm not convinced how well the program (I used DOE-2.1E) was modeling thermal mass and ground heat transfer, especially under floating temperature conditions.  That's why I would be interested to learn of your real-life assessment (especially if you're recording actual data) of such a house.

    My area of expertise is simulation of mechanical systems, and I do not claim to be an expert in heavy mass walls.  However I'll stick my neck out and add my thoughts to this discussion, and invite others to respond.  

    I agree with Curt Petersen.  But, in addition to being frequency dependent, my understanding is that heavy-mass wall performance is also dependent on the average daily temperature differential across the wall, the placement of mass vs. insulation, and interior heat gains.  

    1)  Mass vs. Resistance (vs. daily outdoor temperature swing)

    Assume a lightweight interior space, having no internal loads, is to be maintained at 70F.  If the average daily outdoor temperature is also 70F, and the daily outdoor temperature is swinging +/- 15F about the average, then a heavy construction will maintain the interior temperature very close to 70F.  In this situation, the heavy mass wall will perform better than a resistance wall.

    If instead the average daily temperature is 30F, with the same daily swing, then the interior temperature will be close to 30F.  This is also true of a resistance wall.  However, the daily (not instantaneous) amount of heat required to maintain the interior temperature at 70F is now a function of the resistance, not the impedance, and the low-resistance heavy-mass wall will require considerably more heat to maintain 70F.

    In other words, for a heavy mass wall to get credit for impedance, the outdoor temperature swing must overlap the desired interior temperature.  The closer the average outdoor temperature to the indoor, the greater the effect of the impedance.  This has significant ramifications for different climates.  For moderate climates or moderate seasons where the outdoor temperature swing overlaps the desired interior temperature for the majority of hours, heavy mass walls can work well.  For more extreme climates or seasons, it's hard to see how a heavy mass wall can be of significant benefit.  

    I live in Sacramento, Calif where the average lo/hi summer temperatures are 60F and 95F.  Here, a mass wall can work well.  However, in winter, the average temperatures are around 40F/60F, and I wouldn't be willing to trade a well-insulated house for one built out of uninsulated concrete!  

    2) Placement of mass vs. insulation (vs. solar gains)

    The above is a little too simplistic because it ignores the placement of mass vs. insulation, and solar gains.  Assume the sun is shining strongly on a wall.  If the insulation is to the outside of the mass, then the outer wall surface temperature (sol-air temperature) will be hotter than if the mass is to the outside.  This is because the mass readily conducts heat inward, whereas insulation doesn't.  Since re-radiation is proportional to the fourth power of absolute temperature, placing the insulation to the outside will cause the wall to instantaneously reject a greater portion of the solar gain.  Placing the mass to the outside allows the wall to capture more of the solar gain; part re-readiates at night, but part conducts into the space.  So which is better?  It depends on whether you are more concerned about winter or summer performance, and how sunny those seasons are.

    I recently participated in a study of a refrigerated warehouse that demonstrated this effect.  Holding all factors constant except the placement of mass vs. insulation, mass to the outside of the wall increased annual cooling loads because of the increased capture of solar gains.  (And by the way, this effect was captured in DOE-2).

    3)  Effect of interior loads

    High interiors loads and/or solar gains thru windows, as well as when they occur bias all of the above.  


    Conclusion?  For residential buildings, I believe that a high-resistance shell with a moderate amount of interior mass is the most cost-effective approach for most climates.  While overly simple, a key concept is the "time constant" of a house, which is the product of resistance and capacitance.  The interior temperature decays to the exterior temperature as a function of the time constant (  exp(1/RC) ).  The greater the time constant, the slower the decay rate.  In general it is cheaper to achieve a given time constant by adding insulation instead of thermal mass.

    I just built a two-story house and am currently testing this theory.  The interior mass consists of a concrete slab with about 60% tile on the first floor, and 5/8" sheetrock interior walls.  The exterior walls are 2x6 studs with damp-spray rock-wool insulation (R22 in a 5-1/2" cavity, with no voids).  The windows are fiberglass, low-e2, with overhangs on the east, south, and west exposures; most windows facing north and south (~14% of floor area).  The attic has blown rock-wool.  The roof is metal over 2" fiberglass insulation, with a radiant barrier on the underside.  I opted for a metal roof instead of tile because we live in earthquake country, and I wanted the roof to be as light as possible, while still durable.  The kitchen appliances are all electric, as the house is well-sealed and I didn't want to worry about the NOx and CO produced by a gas stove.  All bathroom exhaust fans are on timers to ensure moisture removal after bathing.

    We moved in late last summer.  During September, the outdoor temperature range was typically 60F to 95F.  The interior temperature stayed in the low-70's without any air conditioning, and swung about 2-3F.  We ran the whole house fan a couple of nights just to see how cool we could get it, but didn't need to.  I don't know about winter performance yet, but so far we have been heating the entire house (3500 sq.ft.) using two 20,000 Btuh, 80% efficient, thermostatically-controlled gas fireplaces.  Outdoor temperatures have been as low as 35F, but we have not yet needed the conventional forced-air gas furnaces to maintain 70F inside, and most of the time the fireplaces are off.  

    This house hardly fits the classic definition of a "passive solar" house, but it performs like one because of its high time constant, achieved primarily through insulation rather than mass.  While the tile floors were great during the summer, I am waiting until March to assess the comfort of these floors with colder ground temperatures (the slab is not insulated).  If anyone wants an update later on, send me your address.

      Dave:

      This concept falls into the "cheater" category. What happens is that the proponents of heavy construction elements show that the steady periodic behavior of a heavy structure, at some well-selected frequency, is better than the behavior at steady state. The electrical analogy would be to replace resistance with capacitive impedance. Of course it depends on the frequency, and it is not resistance, so the steady state (zero frequency) result will be different. 

      A reasonable building simulation tool properly accounts for both the capacitance and the resistance of a building element. The "effective R" is bogus.

Re. Mass/Insulation Discussion:

We have on our web site (see below) a free program called OPAQUE that 
allows you to graphically assemble wall sections made up of mass and 
insulation in any combinations and thicknesses, and it will plot the hourly 
heat gain through the wall, plus hourly outdoor air temperature and solar 
gains for the orientation you choose... It also calculates the U factor, 
time lag and decrement...

My area of expertise is simulation of mechanical systems, and I do not claim to be an expert in heavy mass walls.  However I'll stick my neck out and add my thoughts to this discussion, and invite others to respond.  

I agree with Curt Petersen.  But, in addition to being frequency dependent, my understanding is that heavy-mass wall performance is also dependent on the average daily temperature differential across the wall, the placement of mass vs. insulation, and interior heat gains.  

1)  Mass vs. Resistance (vs. daily outdoor temperature swing)

Assume a lightweight interior space, having no internal loads, is to be maintained at 70F.  If the average daily outdoor temperature is also 70F, and the daily outdoor temperature is swinging +/- 15F about the average, then a heavy construction will maintain the interior temperature very close to 70F.  In this situation, the heavy mass wall will perform better than a resistance wall.

If instead the average daily temperature is 30F, with the same daily swing, then the interior temperature will be close to 30F.  This is also true of a resistance wall.  However, the daily (not instantaneous) amount of heat required to maintain the interior temperature at 70F is now a function of the resistance, not the impedance, and the low-resistance heavy-mass wall will require considerably more heat to maintain 70F.

In other words, for a heavy mass wall to get credit for impedance, the outdoor temperature swing must overlap the desired interior temperature.  The closer the average outdoor temperature to the indoor, the greater the effect of the impedance.  This has significant ramifications for different climates.  For moderate climates or moderate seasons where the outdoor temperature swing overlaps the desired interior temperature for the majority of hours, heavy mass walls can work well.  For more extreme climates or seasons, it's hard to see how a heavy mass wall can be of significant benefit.  

I live in Sacramento, Calif where the average lo/hi summer temperatures are 60F and 95F.  Here, a mass wall can work well.  However, in winter, the average temperatures are around 40F/60F, and I wouldn't be willing to trade a well-insulated house for one built out of uninsulated concrete!  

2) Placement of mass vs. insulation (vs. solar gains)

The above is a little too simplistic because it ignores the placement of mass vs. insulation, and solar gains.  Assume the sun is shining strongly on a wall.  If the insulation is to the outside of the mass, then the outer wall surface temperature (sol-air temperature) will be hotter than if the mass is to the outside.  This is because the mass readily conducts heat inward, whereas insulation doesn't.  Since re-radiation is proportional to the fourth power of absolute temperature, placing the insulation to the outside will cause the wall to instantaneously reject a greater portion of the solar gain.  Placing the mass to the outside allows the wall to capture more of the solar gain; part re-readiates at night, but part conducts into the space.  So which is better?  It depends on whether you are more concerned about winter or summer performance, and how sunny those seasons are.

I recently participated in a study of a refrigerated warehouse that demonstrated this effect.  Holding all factors constant except the placement of mass vs. insulation, mass to the outside of the wall increased annual cooling loads because of the increased capture of solar gains.  (And by the way, this effect was captured in DOE-2).

3)  Effect of interior loads

High interiors loads and/or solar gains thru windows, as well as when they occur bias all of the above.  


Conclusion?  For residential buildings, I believe that a high-resistance shell with a moderate amount of interior mass is the most cost-effective approach for most climates.  While overly simple, a key concept is the "time constant" of a house, which is the product of resistance and capacitance.  The interior temperature decays to the exterior temperature as a function of the time constant (  exp(1/RC) ).  The greater the time constant, the slower the decay rate.  In general it is cheaper to achieve a given time constant by adding insulation instead of thermal mass.

I just built a two-story house and am currently testing this theory.  The interior mass consists of a concrete slab with about 60% tile on the first floor, and 5/8" sheetrock interior walls.  The exterior walls are 2x6 studs with damp-spray rock-wool insulation (R22 in a 5-1/2" cavity, with no voids).  The windows are fiberglass, low-e2, with overhangs on the east, south, and west exposures; most windows facing north and south (~14% of floor area).  The attic has blown rock-wool.  The roof is metal over 2" fiberglass insulation, with a radiant barrier on the underside.  I opted for a metal roof instead of tile because we live in earthquake country, and I wanted the roof to be as light as possible, while still durable.  The kitchen appliances are all electric, as the house is well-sealed and I didn't want to worry about the NOx and CO produced by a gas stove.  All bathroom exhaust fans are on timers to ensure moisture removal after bathing.

We moved in late last summer.  During September, the outdoor temperature range was typically 60F to 95F.  The interior temperature stayed in the low-70's without any air conditioning, and swung about 2-3F.  We ran the whole house fan a couple of nights just to see how cool we could get it, but didn't need to.  I don't know about winter performance yet, but so far we have been heating the entire house (3500 sq.ft.) using two 20,000 Btuh, 80% efficient, thermostatically-controlled gas fireplaces.  Outdoor temperatures have been as low as 35F, but we have not yet needed the conventional forced-air gas furnaces to maintain 70F inside, and most of the time the fireplaces are off.  

This house hardly fits the classic definition of a "passive solar" house, but it performs like one because of its high time constant, achieved primarily through insulation rather than mass.  While the tile floors were great during the summer, I am waiting until March to assess the comfort of these floors with colder ground temperatures (the slab is not insulated).  If anyone wants an update later on, send me your address.

  Dave:

  This concept falls into the "cheater" category. What happens is that the proponents of heavy construction elements show that the steady periodic behavior of a heavy structure, at some well-selected frequency, is better than the behavior at steady state. The electrical analogy would be to replace resistance with capacitive impedance. Of course it depends on the frequency, and it is not resistance, so the steady state (zero frequency) result will be different. 

  A reasonable building simulation tool properly accounts for both the capacitance and the resistance of a building element. The "effective R" is bogus.

Hello:
 
We are currently completing a report for the Texas Legislature where we have
attempted to simulate the effects of thermal mass on a "standard" building
as defined by the 2000 IECC. So far, we've spent most of our time trying to
define how to simulate the building, since the 2000 IECC is flawed in that
it requires 13.5 lb/ft2 of floor space, which makes the simulation of
thermal mass impossible with DOE-2. (i.e., it forces the use of floor-weight
values, which then use pre-calculated ASHRAE weighting factors, which are
not as accurate as custom weighting factors). 
 
There are multiple issues with accomplishing this with DOE-2, which our
report points out in some detail. In general the report shows mixed results,
with the largest variation coming from peak value predictions, which is
important for Texas and the Ozone reduction during summertime (i.e.,reduce
peak cooling loads). We also found the following items affect the results:
SC vs Window 5 simulation of windows, Effective-U value and fictitious
ground heat transfer (i.e., Winklemann's memo), placement of the mass has an
impact as well (inside or outside of thermal mass). Finally, the ground
temperatures that DOE-2 uses when using a TMY2 tape for a city are suspect
(i.e., too cold for Texas in the summer and winter, average o.k.). I'm
hoping to have a synopsis of the report to pass around at the next 90.1
Envelop meeting and/or TC 4.7 in Kansas City.

The DOE sponsored research to test the effect of the thermal mass and the 
relation between thermal mass and thermal insulation in different climates. DOE-2 
was used to simulate different building alternatives. In summary, the 
research results showed that thermal mass may increase, decrease or has no effect on 
energy consumption.

The equivalent wall concept incorporates the increased performance of your large thermal mass wall relative to say a wood frame structure due to both changes in insulation and thermal mass.  Therefore, increasing the R-value of your structure to the effective R-value and then increasing the mass would unrealistically make your building perform even better.  Even though I have never used it, DOE2 does not handle thermal mass benefits that well which is one of the improvements with using EnergyPlus.  Two journals that I recommend reading from ASHRAE Transactions are:

"Performance Check Between Whole Building Thermal Performance Criteria and Exterior Wall Measured Clear Wall R-Value, Thermal Briding, Thermal Mass, and Airtightness" by Jan Kosny, J.E. Christian ....

"Thermal Mass Credits Relating to Building Envelope Energy Standards" by "J.E. Christian

Hope these help.
